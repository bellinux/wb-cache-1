2500|$|On {{the night}} of 24February 1932, when Puyi {{accepted}} the offer to be Chief Executive of Manchukuo, a party was thrown to celebrate with geishas being imported for the celebration, during which Itagaki become very drunk, and forgetting that the geisha are entertainers, not prostitutes, made outrageous sexual advances on the geisha, fondling their breasts and vaginas, telling Puyi that as a general he could do anything he wanted to the geisha. During the party, while Itagaki boasted to Puyi that now was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> be a Japanese man, Puyi was much offended when none of the geisha knew who he was.|$|E
2500|$|Executive Producer Santer said, [...] "With all {{the turmoil}} facing the Mitchells this year, {{it feels like}} <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> bring back Sam, the {{original}} Mitchell sister. I'd like {{to take this opportunity}} to thank Kim Medcalf for her great work playing Sam Mitchell for three years and welcome Danniella back to pick up the baton once again." [...] In an interview with media website Digital Spy, Santer discussed the reasoning behind his decision to reintroduce Sam: [...] "What makes Sam interesting for me is that she's Ricky's first love and first wife. As Bianca and Ricky spend more time together [...] the inevitability of them at some point coming together increases. What's stopping them? Well, it's Sam. Sam and Ricky had a good thing going all those years ago. All Ricky ever gets off Bianca is indifference, whereas Sam - and who knows quite why - is less than indifferent towards him and it makes a nice change".|$|E

50|$|Both sides {{deployed}} tunnelling, {{with the}} German lead quickly {{followed by the}} British follow-up. The result was a labyrinth of tunnels within a cat and mouse-like game of tunnelling, counter-tunnelling and counter tactics. As the tactics and counter tactics deployed against each other became less and less effective, the depth at which the tunnels needed to be dug became deeper and deeper and hence more dangerous. The result was <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> dig, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> vulnerability to both leakage of information and tunnel collapse, and a higher loss of lives in the most hideous of circumstances: entombment, drowning, gassing or obliteration in cramped and claustrophobic galleries beneath no man's land.|$|R

30|$|Comparing {{different}} scenarios, {{the average}} difference between ED and MHED routes is greater in Scenario 1 than in Scenario 2. As every other parameter {{is the same}} for the two scenarios in this experiment, the explanation of the difference is found in the connection profiles. Disconnection times in Scenario 1 are greater than those in Scenario 2, on the average. Higher disconnection times make next-connection opportunities later, therefore giving MHED <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>time</b> interval <b>to</b> find routes in fewer hops.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} spring, {{the river is}} lined with {{blooming}} pink and white mountain laurel. Early spring is also <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> go rafting, kayaking, or canoeing because of the higher flows and cooler temperatures. The Chattooga is a free-flowing river (no upstream dam to control the flow) which quickly responds to rainfall or drought conditions. As a drop-pool style river, rapids are followed by calm pools for swimming.|$|E

5000|$|Said Taylor in an interview, [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> be a folk singer. Coffee houses existed as {{performance}} venues: {{people came}} to hear the music {{and there was no}} liquor to bend the audience into an inattentive crowd - and the coffee kept most of the listeners awake. I worked out of Chicago and became friends with Shel Silverstein, an incredibly talented man who could write a clever lyric about anything. We wrote several songs together, including MARIE LAVAUX and THE MONKEY AND THE ELEPHANT." ...|$|E
50|$|Tea {{and coffee}} are served every Wednesday {{afternoon}} in Macmillan Hall's Art Exhibit Room (as of 2016, in The Grind, Wells's student-run coffee shop). Though the long dresses and china cups {{have long since}} disappeared, this break from afternoon seminars is still <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get together with friends and professors. Students, faculty and staff are encouraged to participate in Wells Wednesdays and wear red clothing or accessories or Wells College gear to show their Spirit on Wednesdays. Students participating are often rewarded at Tea Time with giveaways and special treats from the Office of Student Activities and Leadership.|$|E
30|$|With {{regard to}} {{scores on the}} Stroop Task, the {{experimental}} condition group had greater scores in part 2 (incongruent items), smaller interference scores (smaller difference between scores in part 2 and part 1), and, marginally, <b>greater</b> reaction <b>time</b> in part 2 (spending more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> answer). These results suggest that children {{in the experimental group}} were better able to inhibit the automatic tendency, showing a pattern of better performance in conflict situations (that is, in the face of incongruent situations), which seems to be accompanied by a tendency of <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> respond. Note that significant differences were observed in part 2 but not in part 1, as in Diamond et al. (2007), who found effects only on the most difficult items. Considering time measures, this finding argues against a general effect on speed processing, corroborating a specific improvement in interference control situations. It is interesting to note that, among the significant effects, those in score in part 2 and interference score on the Stroop Test are some of the highest observed in the study, which suggests that this task demand is sensitive to the PIAFEx intervention carried out, which taught thinking before answering, thereby avoiding prepotent answers.|$|R
