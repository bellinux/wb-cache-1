5|$|Lionhead Studios used Michael Bratman's belief–desire–intention {{model to}} {{simulate}} creatures' learning {{and decision making}} processes. A creature forms <b>an</b> <b>intention</b> by combining desires, opinions, and beliefs. Beliefs are attributed to lists that store data about various world objects. Desires are goals the creature wants to fulfill, expressed as simplified perceptrons. Opinions describe ways of satisfying a desire using decision trees. For each desire, the creature selects the belief with the best opinion, thus forming <b>an</b> <b>intention</b> or goal.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{asks whether}} it is {{possible}} to design <b>an</b> <b>Intentions</b> Revealing Experiment – that is, an experiment in which the early moves of the decision maker in a dynamic decision problem reveal the intentions of that decision maker regarding later moves in the decision problem. If such a type of experiment is possible, then it will enable economists to test whether individuals have plans and implement them – a basic assumption of all economic theories of dynamic decision making. Unfortunately the main finding of the paper {{is in the form of}} two Impossibility Theorems which show that, unless one is prepared to make certain assumptions, such <b>an</b> <b>Intentions</b> Revealing Experiment is impossible. However, the paper does have a positive side – it describes the type of assumptions that one needs to make in order to make <b>an</b> <b>Intentions</b> Revealing Experiment possible. crisis, Romania, strategy, inversion...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThis paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>a</b> taxpayer’s <b>intention</b> in the way certain transactions will be taxed. The paper will examine the weight accorded to <b>a</b> taxpayer’s stated <b>intention</b> in different situations (i. e. in what situations/ transactions will <b>a</b> taxpayer’s <b>intention</b> have comparatively little weight {{when compared to the}} objective facts of the case?) The paper first ascertains the meaning of intention/purpose/motive in terms of the Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962 as amended, (hereafter referred to as “the Act”). The question is whether these words are synonymous or have separate and discrete meanings. The paper then looks at the typical areas of difficulty associated with <b>a</b> taxpayer’s <b>intention.</b> Share disposals are one example discussed, as {{it is often difficult to}} determine whether these disposals are of a capital or revenue nature. The weight accorded to <b>a</b> taxpayer’s <b>intention</b> in schemes involving tax avoidance is also discussed. Case law surrounding section 20 A and section 80 A-S 80 L of the Act are reviewed to ascertain how <b>a</b> taxpayer’s <b>intention</b> is dealt with in these section...|$|R

5|$|The role {{of intent}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} and definitive elements of the karma theory, in all its traditions. In Jainism, intent is important but not an essential precondition of sin or wrong conduct. Evil intent forms only one of the modes of committing sin. Any action committed, knowingly or unknowingly, has karmic repercussions. In certain philosophies, like Buddhism, a person is guilty of violence only if he had <b>an</b> <b>intention</b> to commit violence. On the other hand, according to Jains, if an act produces violence, then the person is guilty of it, whether or not he had <b>an</b> <b>intention</b> to commit it.|$|E

After the ceasefire agreement was negotiated by French president Nicolas Sarkozy on 12 August, military action was to cease at 15:00 on 12 August, however Russian forces didn't stop to advance.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the notion of}} {{collective}} intention in teams of agents involved in cooperative problem solving (CPS) in multiagent systems (MAS) is investigated. Starting from individual intentions, goals,andbeliefs defining agents' local asocial motivational and informational attitudes, we arrive at an understanding of <b>a</b> collective <b>intention</b> in <b>a</b> team of agents. The presented definitions are rather strong, in particular <b>a</b> collective <b>intention</b> implies that all members intend for all others to share that intention. Based on this, we assume that a team of agents is created {{on the basis of}} <b>a</b> collective <b>intention,</b> and exists as long as this attitude between team members exists, after which the group may disintegrate. For this reason it is crucial that <b>a</b> collective <b>intention</b> within <b>a</b> group lasts long enough...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that forming <b>an</b> implementation <b>intention</b> promotes goal pursuit and achievement. Forming <b>an</b> implementation <b>intention</b> {{encourages people to}} develop a plan, to prepare for events that allow for {{the execution of the}} plan, and to efficiently respond to these opportunities. Yet, forming <b>an</b> implementation <b>intention</b> may not be universally beneficial. An implementation intention may encourage the use of means {{that are part of the}} plan but may discourage the use of efficacious means that are not part of the plan. Four experiments show that forming <b>an</b> implementation <b>intention</b> decreases the likelihood of responding to goal-directed, out-of-plan behaviors when a person is in a concrete mind-set. Limitations, implications, and directions for future research are discussed. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Employee {{turnover}} is {{an important}} issue for any organization, but it is of critical importance for volunteer organizations. Research shows that a strong predictor of volunteer turnover is <b>a</b> volunteer’s <b>intention</b> to remain in that organization. This study measured volunteers’ intention to remain and compared the known predictor of burnout to the potential predictor of personality (through personality traits) in order to find a better predictor of <b>a</b> volunteer’s <b>intention</b> to remain in an organization. Using survey data obtained from 65 participants from a single volunteer organization, this study showed that burnout and personality traits failed to predict <b>a</b> volunteer’s <b>intention</b> to remain in an organization. Pearson correlations and a hierarchical regression of the personality traits found that the agreeableness personality trait was a weak predictor of <b>a</b> volunteer’s <b>intention</b> to remain in an organization.

5|$|Equines {{produce a}} number of vocalizations and noises. Loud {{snorting}} is associated with alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors will also squeal while play fighting. The contact calls of equines vary from the whinnying and nickering of the horse, the barking of plains zebras, and the braying of asses and Grévy's zebras. Equines also communicate with visual displays and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also incorporate {{the positions of the}} head, ears and tail. An equine may signal <b>an</b> <b>intention</b> to kick by laying back its ears and sometimes lashing the tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth and abrupt movement of the heads may be used as threatening gestures, particularly among stallions.|$|E
