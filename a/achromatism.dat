50|$|According to Newton, refracted light must appear colored. With the {{achromatic}} refractor, however, {{this is not}} the case.

According to Schopenhauer, <b>achromatism</b> results when refraction occurs in one direction in the concave lens and in another direction in the convex lens. A blue band then overlaps an orange band while a violet edge covers the yellow.

50|$|The focal lengths {{are made}} equal for the lines C and F. In the {{neighborhood}} of 550 nm the tangent to the curve {{is parallel to the}} axis of wavelengths; and the focal length varies least over a fairly large range of color, therefore in this neighborhood the color union is at its best. Moreover, this region of the spectrum is that which appears brightest to the human eye, and consequently this curve of the secondary on spectrum, obtained by making , is, according to the experiments of Sir G. G. Stokes (Proc. Roy. Soc., 1878), the most suitable for visual instruments (optical <b>achromatism,).</b> In a similar manner, for systems used in photography, the vertex of the color curve must be placed in the position of the maximum sensibility of the plates; this is generally supposed to be at G'; and to accomplish this the F and violet mercury lines are united. This artifice is specially adopted in objectives for astronomical photography (pure actinic <b>achromatism).</b> For ordinary photography, however, there is this disadvantage: the image on the focusing-screen and the correct adjustment of the photographic sensitive plate are not in register; in astronomical photography this difference is constant, but in other kinds it depends on the distance of the objects. On this account the lines D and G' are united for ordinary photographic objectives; the optical as well as the actinic image is chromatically inferior, but both lie in the same place; and consequently the best correction lies in F (this is known as the actinic correction or freedom from chemical focus).|$|E

Trans., 1758), describing the experiments {{that led him}} to the achievement with which his name is specially associated, the discovery of a means of constructing achromatic lenses by the combination of crown and flint glasses, which reduces chromatic aberration (color defects). Leonhard Euler in 1747 had suggested that <b>achromatism</b> might be obtained by the combination of glass and water lenses. Relying on statements made by Sir Isaac Newton, Dollond disputed this possibility (Phil. Trans., 1753), but subsequently, after the Swedish physicist, Samuel Klingenstierna (1698-1765), had pointed out that Newton's law of dispersion did not harmonize with certain observed facts, he began experiments to settle the question.|$|E
5000|$|In one case, a 78-year-old stroke {{victim had}} {{lost the ability to}} {{identify}} color, but was unaware of his deficit until doctors performed color discretion tests.Even when presented with this information, the patient believed he had retained his ability to perceive color even though the world around him appeared grey. He attributed this <b>achromatism</b> to [...] "poor lighting" [...] and it took several weeks for the patient to fully appreciate the extent of his disability. In addition, the characteristic comorbidity of prosopagnosia was present. After two months and frequent sessions with doctors, tests indicated his color had fully returned. The ischemia caused by lesions on the posterior cerebral arteries had subsided and follow up MRI scans indicated that blood flow had once again returned to the VOC.|$|E
5000|$|In {{practice}} {{it is more}} advantageous (after Abbe) to determine the chromatic aberration (for instance, that of the distance of intersection) for a fixed position of the object, and express it by a sum in which each component conlins the amount due to each refracting surface. [...] In a plane containing the image point of one color, another colour produces a disk of confusion; {{this is similar to}} the confusion caused by two zones in spherical aberration. For infinitely distant objects the radius Of the chromatic disk of confusion is proportional to the linear aperture, and independent of the focal length (vide supra, Monochromatic Aberration of the Axis Point); and since this disk becomes the less harmful with an increasing image of a given object, or with increasing focal length, it follows that the deterioration of the image is proportional to the ratio of the aperture to the focal length, i.e. the relative aperture. (This explains the gigantic focal lengths in vogue before the discovery of <b>achromatism.)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|In optical systems {{composed}} of lenses, the position, magnitude and errors {{of the image}} depend upon the refractive indices of the glass employed (see Lens (optics) and Monochromatic aberration, above). Since the index of refraction varies with the color or wavelength of the light (see dispersion), it follows that a system of lenses (uncorrected) projects images of different colors in somewhat different places and sizes and with different aberrations; i.e. there are chromatic differences of the distances of intersection, of magnifications, and of monochromatic aberrations. If mixed light be employed (e.g. white light) all these images are formed and they cause a confusion, named chromatic aberration; for instance, instead of a white margin on a dark background, there is perceived a colored margin, or narrow spectrum. The absence of this error is termed <b>achromatism,</b> and an optical system so corrected is termed achromatic. A system {{is said to be}} chromatically under-corrected when it shows the same kind of chromatic error as a thin positive lens, otherwise it is said to be overcorrected.|$|E
5000|$|Should {{there be}} in two lenses in contact the same focal lengths for three colours a, b, and c, i.e. , then the {{relative}} partial dispersion [...] must be equal {{for the two}} kinds of glass employed. This follows by considering equation (4) for the two pairs of colors ac and bc. Until recently no glasses were known with a proportional degree of absorption; but R. Blair (Trans. Edin. Soc., 1791, 3, p. 3), P. Barlow, and F. S. Archer overcame the difficulty by constructing fluid lenses between glass walls. Fraunhofer prepared glasses which reduced the secondary spectrum; but permanent success was only assured on {{the introduction of the}} Jena glasses by E. Abbe and O. Schott. In using glasses not having proportional dispersion, the deviation of a third colour can be eliminated by two lenses, if an interval be allowed between them; or by three lenses in contact, which may not all consist of the old glasses. In uniting three colors an <b>achromatism</b> of a higher order is derived; there is yet a residual tertiary spectrum, but it can always be neglected.|$|E
50|$|If rays issuing from O (fig. 1) be concurrent, it {{does not}} follow that points in a portion of a plane {{perpendicular}} at O to the axis will be also concurrent, even if the part of the plane be very small. With a considerable aperture, the neighboring point N will be reproduced, but attended by aberrations comparable in magnitude to ON. These aberrations are avoided if, according to Abbe, the sine condition, sin u'1/sin u1=sin u'2/sin u2, holds for all rays reproducing the point O. If the object point O is infinitely distant, u1 and u2 are to be replaced by h1 and h2, the perpendicular heights of incidence; the sine condition then becomes sin u'1/h1=sin u'2/h2. A system fulfilling this condition and free from spherical aberration is called aplanatic (Greek a-, privative, plann, a wandering). This word was first used by Robert Blair (d. 1828), professor of practical astronomy at Edinburgh University, to characterize a superior <b>achromatism,</b> and, subsequently, by many writers to denote freedom from spherical aberration. Both the aberration of axis points, and the deviation from the sine condition, rapidly increase in most (uncorrected) systems with the aperture.|$|E
5000|$|If, in {{the first}} place, {{monochromatic}} aberrations be neglected — in other words, the Gaussian theory be accepted — then every reproduction {{is determined by the}} positions of the focal planes, and the magnitude of the focal lengths, or if the focal lengths, as ordinarily happens, be equal, by three constants of reproduction. These constants are determined by the data of the system (radii, thicknesses, distances, indices, etc., of the lenses); therefore their dependence on the refractive index, and consequently on the color, are calculable. [...] The refractive indices for different wavelengths must be known for each kind of glass made use of. In this manner the conditions are maintained that any one constant of reproduction is equal for two different colors, i.e. this constant is achromatized. For example, it is possible, with one thick lens in air, to achromatize the position of a focal plane of the magnitude of the focal length. If all three constants of reproduction be achromatized, then the Gaussian image for all distances of objects is the same for the two colors, and the system is said to be in stable <b>achromatism.</b>|$|E

40|$|A superachromatic quarter-wave {{retarder}} {{using an}} arbitrary number of waveplates in a broadband spectral range has been proposed.

As application examples, the design of a quarter-wave retarder using two, three, and four waveplates in the spectral ranges of 500 - 700 nm and 400 - 1000 nm was studied. The numerical results show that for these ranges, the best designs obtained present a maximum difference of 0. 013 degrees and 0. 010 degrees with respect to the target retardation, respectively.

40|$|Adaptive optics {{coupled to}} a {{coronagraph}} {{can be a}} unique tool to study the close environment of bright objects such as stars or AGNs, especially on large telescope where the achievable angular resolution becomes extremely high (25 mas). We describe a new concept of stellar coronagraph using a phase mask at the focal plane. The mask features four quadrants, each suffering a phase shift of r with respect to its neighbors. This coronagraph (4 QC) presents an excellent rejection rate, a good capacity to detect asymmetric sources such as a faint companion, a good behavior with respect to residual tip-tilt errors, at least on simulations, and can be rather easily made achromatic. We examine the different properties of this device in terms of rejection rate (we show that it could in principle be infinite for a fully circular pupil), {{as well as the}} main sources of limitations introduced by the atmosphere, the pupil shape and the chromatic dependency of the phase shift. We estimate the performances under different conditions of adaptive optics correction and of other perturbations of the phase. Practical solutions for the manufacturing of the phase mask device (in transmission or in reflection) are presented with the corresponding esti- mates of performance.

40|$|Obrađuje se skupina ikona u Dalmaciji s temom Bogorodice s Djetetom u shemi Skopiotise. Uz stilsku analizu izdvaja se ikonografska shema i vezuje uz Bogorodičinu ikonu koja se štovala u manastiru Skopos na otoku Zakintu u Jonskom moru. There {{exists in}} Dalmatia {{a group of}} icons of Our Lady With Child which have the same stylistic form as the icon in the Mimara museum in Zagreb. All these icons are painted on a dark {{background}} varying in colour from red and blue to silver. The faces and hands of Our Lady and Child are painted, while the clothes, haloes and crowns are done in pastiglia in shallow relief and covered with silvery leaves. Many lines suggesting pleats in clothing,crowns and haloes with curly or geometrical ornaments are engraved into a uniform and gently protruding surface. The elements are differentiated by graphics rather than painting. On some of these icons, including the one from Zagreb, the name Skopiotissa is engraved in Greek letters, clearly identifying them. Names according to which icons become famous are most often derived from places, churches or monasteries where they were originally venerated. Inscriptions and abbreviations of represented names are necessary components of icons,entering into {{the very essence of}} their theology and their connection with the archetype. In the same way that representation of a person in an icon is not a mere illustration, but represents an archetype- therefore the icon is the very person which is represented - the identifying inscription reflects the archetype. The veneration relates to the name of the represented {{in the same way as}} it does to the painted image. The identifying inscription of these icons clearly denotes the geographical origin of the cult: the monastery of Skopos on the Island of Zacynthus in the middle of the Ionian Sea. Both the inscription and the structure of the icon, which with minor variations is frequently repeated, clearly demonstrate the affirmed cult of Our Lady. The well-known Venetian chronicler Flaminio Cornaro confirmed this. During a flight of Panvenetianism, in 1761 he noted in detail all well-known cults of Our Lady in the area of the Venetian Republic. He described all pictures and statues of Our Lady, with historic enumeration of the shrines which were created around them. He wrote several pages on the cult of Our Lady from the shrine of Skopos on Zacynthus. The iconographic type at the time of Cornaro was already established and supported by an unambiguous inscription. The copper-etched illustration of the icon of Skopiotissa from Cornaro 2 ̆ 7 s book shows Our Lady as a Hodigitria to the waist, with the Child on her left arm. The child is blessing with the right hand holding a closed volume in his left hand. Although it is difficult to establish the detailed stylistic characteristics of the icon from the schematic nature of the illustration, it is clear that the Mimara and the other Dalmatian icons imitate it almost completely. In view of the distribution of the icons of Skopiotissa, there is a clear concentration of the cult within the Ionian and Adriatic Seas to Venice and Ravenna. The cause of such popularity is noted already by F. Cornaro: Our Lady of Skopiotissan was particularly venerated by seamen. Via the most important sea-ports of Boka Kotorska, Orebić, Korčula, the islands of Bračand Hvar, Split, the Kaštela, Krapanj and Šibenik, the cult of Our Lady of Skopiotissa spread throughout Venetian Dalmatia. The icons of Skopiotissa as pictures intended for private or public veneration were carried by captains and seamen. They were venerated in the houses of captains and tradesmen. Their veneration in churches and monasteries was related most probably to the custom of family pictures being left to posterity as votive gifts. Skopiotissa in Pučišća has a clear votive inscription by the Brač nobleman Nikola Moro. The Dalmatian Skopiotiss as are known in two variants. One is the already-described Hodigitria with Child on the left arm, like the original from Zacynthus. The icons from Zagreb, Pučisća, Poljud and Hvar and Split belong to this group, with small variations. The icons of Mimara, Pučišća, Poljud and Hvar are flanked,however, by hanging chandeliers with eternal lights. They hang from three chains, and give light symbolising the power of Christ- of light, and the light which he gave to the people. Burners soaked in oil, also give light to Our Lady, the light of Glory since she has recieved God- the light- into her lap. The other type represents only the bust of Our Lady. The head is slightly inclined to the right, her look is sad and her hands are crossed on her breast in a humble gesture of prayer. Perhaps this type can be considered as a representation of Our Lady of Sadness, as suggested by M. Bianco Fiorin. The crowning of Our Lady has been added to several icons of this group. The inscription (Greek inscription) on one of them precisely defines them semantically. The group of icons of Skopiotissa does not fit stylistically into the well-known iconographic schools of the 17 th and 18 th centuries, nor into the Greek or the well-known and stylistically recognisable Cretan school. But these atypical and hybrid icons represent, by their number and characteristics,a clear stylistic form distinct within paintings of icons. The dominant and pronounced use of line of firm opaque dark shadows (although the flesh colour attempts to acquire the softness and roundness of the Cretan school), and the geometry, <b>achromatism</b> and monochromy form their common stylistic features,with a characteristic pastiglia and the use of silver. It can be supposed that along with the influence of Russian, Greek and Cretan icons of that time,the painters of Zacynthus, Cefalonia and Corphu developed what M. Hatdzidakis calls »the style of the Ionian Islands« within which icons of Our Lady were developed. Such convincing archaism, the emphasis on the patina where the old silver glimmers on red, green and blue backgrounds effectively stimulates popular piety. These Skopiotissas, more venerated in the West than within the Orthodox Church, are a real impetus to such feelings. Of schematic character and as a sign of deity, rather than a work of art, they carry characteristics of popular art...|$|E
