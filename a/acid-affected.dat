40|$|BACKGROUND: Caffeic acid was {{reported}} {{in our previous study}} to have potential in inhibiting osteoclastogenesis through inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NFκB). Here in our current study, we would like to investigate further the caffeic <b>acid-affected</b> signaling pathway leading to NFκB inhibition. Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF 6) plays important role in osteoclastogenesis, we applied TRAF 6 - transfected RAW 264 cells D-Clone (RAW-D) cells as model in this study. METHODS: Caffeic acid in various concentrations was added to in vitro osteoclastogenesis of receptor activator nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) -TNFα-induced TRAF 6 -transfected RAW-D cells. Cells were collected, lysed and immunoblotted to detect TRAF 6 expression. To detect tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) + polynucleated cells (PNCs), TRAP staining was performed. Meanwhile, to measure NFκB Activity, cells were transfected with pNFκB-TA-Luc and subjected to Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System. RESULTS: Caffeic acid did not influence TRAF 6 expression of RANKL-TNFα-induced TRAF 6 -transfected RAW-D cells. Caffeic acid diminished NFκB activity of RANKL-TNFα-induced TRAF 6 -transfected RAW-D cells in a concentration dependent manner. Significant NFκB activity inhibitions were seen under treatment of 1 and 10 μg/ml caffeic acid. By adding 10 μg/ml caffeic acid in RANKL-TNFα-induced TRAF 6 -transfected RAW-D cells, TRAP+ PNCs number was significantly suppressed. CONCLUSION: Caffeic acid inhibited RANKL-TNFα-TRAF 6 -induced osteoclastogenesis pathway. Since caffeic acid did not influence TRAF 6 expression, TRAF 6 -RANK interactions and/or TRAF 6 downstream signaling pathway should be further pursued to disclose inhibition mechanism of caffeic acid...|$|E
40|$|The Pumicestone {{region is}} a unique {{catchment}} in northern Moreton Bay, southeast Queensland. The region supports {{a wide range of}} land-use activities as well as attractions such as nature conservation areas. One environmental aspect that has not previously been addressed in this area is the occurrence of minor and trace metals in estuarine sediments associated with the main estuaries of the region. The trace metals included in this investigation are: vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead and arsenic. To determine and evaluate the occurrence and distribution of metals in the area, several components have been analysed: bedrock material, pre-industrial settings, recent estuarine sediments, soils of estuarine origin and mangrove pneumatophores. The 40 sites chosen for sediment and soil samples cover a variety of estuarine settings and represent a range of natural conditions in terms of channel and bank morphology, tidal energy, vegetation cover, relationship to bedrock, water salinity and land disturbance. The chemical, mineralogical and statistical analyses employed in this study enabled (a) establishment of background values for the area, (b) determination of relationships between metals and (c) identification of sites with anomalous metal concentrations. All the metals found in the sediments of the area are sourced from the geological bedrock. The dominant trace elements identified in sediments are Zn, V and Cr. The remaining metals are highly variable spatially. All trace metals are controlled by the presence of Fe and Mn oxides, and by the grainsize of the sediment. Typically, fine-grained Fe-rich materials tend to adsorb more trace metals than sandy sediments. In soils that have developed from estuarine muds, some metals such as Cr, Mo, Pb and As tend to be in larger quantities than in the estuarine counterparts. Some of the elements, which occur in significant amounts in the sediment, have been detected in mangrove tissue (Avicennia marina) such as V, Cr, Zn, Fe and Mn. Of particular note is Cu, which is present in mangrove tissue in quantities many times exceeding the sediment concentration. The comparative analysis of pre-industrial settings and recent sediments and soils highlighted some areas of metal enrichment such as <b>acid-affected</b> sites where oxidation of pyrite has mobilised metals from sediments; these metals are then redistributed in Fe-rich surficial layers. Disturbed banks within the estuaries are also likely to have low levels of metal enrichment due to boating activities...|$|E
