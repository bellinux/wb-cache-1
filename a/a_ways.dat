5|$|In 1806, {{explorer}} David Thompson set {{out from}} Saskatchewan to find {{the source of the}} Columbia. He crossed over the Canadian Rockies through Howse Pass and eventually arrived {{on the banks of the}} Kootenay, which he thought to be the Columbia. Thompson traveled down the river <b>a</b> <b>ways</b> but turned back when he was attacked by Native Americans. The following year, Thompson, his family, and several men made another attempt at finding the Columbia. They crossed over the Rockies at a more northerly spot and traveled down the Blaeberry River to the Columbia, eventually discovering Columbia Lake and establishing there the trading post Kootenae House. In the spring of 1808, he set off down the Kootenay River, this time reaching present-day Montana and Idaho where he established Kullyspell House and Saleesh House, trading posts on Lake Pend Oreille and the Clark Fork, respectively. After spending a winter in Montana, he tried to reach the Columbia by traveling down the Pend Oreille River but failed in this attempt, eventually returning to Kootenae House via the Kootenay River northwards the following spring.|$|E

This agreement also allowed the UN to oversee the use and management of oil revenues, and to see that some of the funds went to pay war reparations and for the work of UNSCOM in Iraq during this period. The distribution of supplies purchased with oil revenues was also to be supervised by UN inspectors to ensure fair and equal distribution throughout the Iraqi population.|$|E

25|$|Indigenous Filipinos have harbored {{their own}} {{religions}} {{long before the}} Spanish had arrived at their shores. Along with these religions, are corresponding burial practices to accompany such religions. Given that the Spanish occupancy in the Philippines had lasted almost four-hundred years, {{it would not be}} a rash assumption that Catholicism should have become widespread or have become the primary religion for the entire nation. This inference, however would be highly problematic as it is quite <b>a</b> <b>ways</b> from the actual truth. Persisting through the Spanish occupation, indigenous Filipino tribes continued with their respective religions and hence, with their customary burial practices. The Spanish influence however, highly affected the religious traditions and customs in the areas surrounding large trade cities and the capital. These influences include the location of the burials, position of the body and decoration of burial goods to name a few.|$|E

The cast for the Berkeley Repertory production was retained for the Broadway production, {{with the exception of}} Caplan, who was replaced by Stark Sands. It was rumored that the show cost between $8 million and $10 million to produce. After six months of performances, the show was [...] "still <b>a</b> <b>ways</b> off from possibly turning a profit" [...] according to a The New York Times report. As a part of the promotion for the show, the cast performed at the Grammy Awards on January 31, 2010 with Green Day.|$|E

[...] "We will be doing a sequel to Heathers next", Ryder stated. [...] "There's Heathers in the real world! We have to keep going!" [...] In a more recent interview Ryder was quoted as saying on the speculation of a Heathers sequel: [...] "I don't know how much of the movie is official; it's <b>a</b> <b>ways</b> away.

500|$|Land {{transport}} of military supplies on the cursus publicus (imperial transport service) was typically by wagons (angariae), {{with a maximum}} legal load of 1,500lbs (680kg), drawn by two pairs of oxen. The payload capacity of most Roman freighter-ships of the period was {{in the range of}} 10,000–20,000 modii (70–140 tonnes) although many of the grain freighters supplying Rome were much larger up 350 tonnes and a few giants which could load 1200 like the Isis which Lucian saw in Athens circa 180 A.D. Thus, a vessel of median capacity of 100 tonnes, with a 20-man crew, could carry the same load as c. 150 wagons (which required 150 drivers and 600 oxen, plus pay for the former and fodder for the animals). A merchant ship would also, with a favourable wind, typically travel three times faster than the typical [...] achieved by the wagons and for as long as there was daylight, whereas oxen could only haul for at most 5 hours per day. Thus freighters could easily cover [...] per day, compared to c. [...] by the wagons. Against this must be set the fact that most freighters of this capacity were propelled by square sails only (and no oars). They could only progress if there was a following wind, and could spend many days in port waiting for one. (However, smaller coastal and fluvial freighters called actuariae combined oars with sail and had more flexibility). Maritime transport was also completely suspended for at least four months in the winter (as stormy weather made it too hazardous) and even {{during the rest of the}} year, shipwrecks were common. Nevertheless, the surviving shipping-rates show that it was cheaper to transport a cargo of grain by sea from Syria to Lusitania (i.e. the entire length of the Mediterranean – and <b>a</b> <b>ways</b> beyond – c. 5,000km) than just [...] overland.|$|E
2500|$|According to Katherine St Asaph of PopDust, {{the song}} was {{probably}} the closest to his and Colbie Caillat's collaboration [...] "Lucky." [...] She added that it was [...] "a gentle acoustic ballad {{with a hint of}} speak-singing <b>a</b> <b>ways</b> in but otherwise straightforward and straight-faced [...] soft-rocks its way through sentiments like [...] "when I look into your eyes, it's like watching the night sky or a beautiful sunrise–there's just so much they hold"–still earnest, but joke-free." [...] Amy Dawson of Metro UK called it [...] "a delicate, countrified guitar ballad that drives into a power-chorus singalong conclusion." [...] Colin McGuire of PopMatters was mixed in his review, writing that [...] "'I Won't Give Up', for instance, is acoustic guitar-laden folky pop that falls at least a little bit flat with its predictably bland approach. While the song's hook proves itself memorable enough, the track never graduates into anything other than the ballad-like tediousness the singer has a tendency to revert into." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the focuses of {{the novel}} is on how combatants {{perceive}} their experiences. In her article discussing the novel's representation of death, literary critic Patricia E. Johnson describes how contemporary society tends to make the casualties and experience of war more abstract, making it hard for non-combatants to imagine the losses. Johnson argues that the entire Regeneration Trilogy [...] breaks the boundaries created by modern society's abstraction of war and its casualties because [...] "mutilation and death are re-presented in <b>a</b> <b>ways</b> that escape warfare's typical conceptual categories, thus..."realising" [...] modern warfare by reconnecting language and material substance." [...] In discussing the first novel specifically, Johnson highlights how the book [...] "repeatedly employs synecdoche" [...] to emphasise the visceral experiences, by describing eviscerated human flesh and how the characters respond to those experiences. She describes experiences like Burns's horrifying head first disembowelment of a corpse as allowing the readers to understand two things: first, that memories of the combatants are recorded in terms of their relationship to actual people, rather than in the vague ideas of people represented by war memorials; and second, the conceptual opposition in Western culture between flesh or body parts and the social definition of a person (for further discussion of this philosophical issue see Mind-body problem).|$|E

2500|$|The United States is {{the only}} one of 30 OECD {{countries}} with no border adjustment element in its tax system. Proponents state that because the FairTax would automatically be border adjustable, the 17% competitive advantage, on average, of foreign producers would be eliminated, immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home. Leo Linbeck, chairman of FairTax.org, has stated that U.S. manufacturers and sellers can not compete successfully with foreign producers because of U.S. tax policy. [...] "The Ways and Means Committee is tasked with writing the taxation laws that raise revenues for the nation but the fact that foreign nations routinely tax U.S. products upon entry and that these nations forgo national taxes on exports to the United States is <b>a</b> <b>Ways</b> and Means blind spot that has all but killed the 'Made in America' label". Under the FairTax, American companies doing business internationally would be able to sell their goods at lower prices but at similar margins, and this would bring jobs to America. In addition, U.S. companies with investments or plants abroad would bring home overseas profits without the penalty of paying income taxes, thus resulting in more U.S. capital investment. This would result in imports and domestic production competing on a level playing field. Exported goods would not be subject to the FairTax, since they would not be consumed in the U.S.; but imported goods sold in the U.S. would be subject to the FairTax because these products would be consumed domestically.|$|E
2500|$|Lucky and Luke start a {{slow process}} of {{reconciling}} when Luke kidnaps Lucky to an abandoned cabin and Lucky watches Luke distressfully dream of the rape while suffering from a delirious fever following a wolf trap accident. Lucky's relationship with his mother becomes further strained in December 1998 when he and Nikolas are told that Stefan Cassadine (Nichols) is Nikolas's father, not the presumed-dead Stavros Cassadine, and Laura had kept the secret. Lucky and Nikolas begin to bond over the betrayal of their respective families. Lucky's estrangement with his parents adds to his newfound open-mindedness about Nikolas, as Jackson told Soap Opera Magazine: [...] "Lucky's been {{trying to change the}} way he looks at things, to not become Luke. That's part of the process – not having the same relationship with Nikolas that Luke has with Stefan. (...) He's trying to find his own Spencer." [...] The former enemies become friends, a sign of Lucky's growth of character. Actress Genie Francis (Laura) explained to Soap Opera Digest in April 1999: [...] "It's huge, absolutely huge. (It's) something that really seemed impossible, but Lucky surprises [...] with his big heart and his maturity." [...] In the same interview, Guza described the acceptance Lucky had come to have about his parents, recounting scenes where Lucky bonds with each. Guza explained: [...] "They still have <b>a</b> <b>ways</b> to go, {{but the important thing is}} they're making the inroads now. (...)
