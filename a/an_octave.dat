5|$|After the 8-part canon is played, it is repeated, {{with the}} 1st {{parts of the}} 1st and 2nd violins (silent up to this point) {{doubling}} the other violin parts <b>an</b> <b>octave</b> higher.|$|E
5|$|Octave couplers, which add {{the pipes}} <b>an</b> <b>octave</b> above (super-octave) or below (sub-octave) each note that is played, may operate on one {{division}} only (for example, the Swell super octave, which adds the octave above {{what is being}} played on the Swell to itself), or act as a coupler to another keyboard (for example, the Swell super-octave to Great, which adds to the Great manual {{the ranks of the}} Swell division <b>an</b> <b>octave</b> above what is being played).|$|E
5|$|Reger {{completes the}} chorale {{setting for the}} chorus, without further {{reference}} to the chorale melody, while the solo voice repeats {{at the same time}} , concluding with descending tones of more than <b>an</b> <b>octave.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Alternately, <b>a</b> blind <b>octave</b> {{may occur}} [...] "in <b>a</b> rapid <b>octave</b> passage when one note of each {{alternate}} octave is omitted." [...] The {{effect is to}} simulate <b>octave</b> doubling using <b>a</b> solo instrument.|$|R
5000|$|In {{classical}} music from Western culture, <b>a</b> diminished <b>octave</b> (...) is <b>an</b> interval produced by narrowing <b>a</b> perfect <b>octave</b> by <b>a</b> chromatic semitone. As such, the two notes are denoted {{by the same}} letter but have different accidentals. For instance, the interval from C4 to C5 is <b>a</b> perfect <b>octave,</b> twelve semitones wide, and both the intervals from C4 to C5, and from C4 to C5 are diminished octaves, spanning eleven semitones. Being diminished, it is considered a dissonant interval.|$|R

5|$|It is {{composed}} as a four-part setting, with the instruments playing : oboes and violin I enforce the chorale tune, the flutes <b>an</b> <b>octave</b> higher, violin II {{plays with the}} alto, viola with the tenor, and the continuo with the bass.|$|E
5|$|The song is a {{love song}} {{composed}} in the key of E major. It is written in common time and moves slowly at 69 beats per minute. Stefani avoids the heavy vocal vibrato that she often uses. Her vocal range spans under <b>an</b> <b>octave</b> and a half during the song, from F#3 to B4.|$|E
5|$|Jabba the Hutt only speaks Huttese on film, but {{his lines}} are subtitled in English. His voice and Huttese-language {{dialogue}} were performed by voice actor Larry Ward, {{whose work is}} not listed in the end credits. A heavy, booming quality was given to Ward's voice by pitching it <b>an</b> <b>octave</b> lower than normal and processing it through a subharmonic generator. A soundtrack of wet, slimy sound effects was recorded to accompany {{the movement of the}} puppet's limbs and mouth.|$|E

50|$|The subcontrabass tuba is an {{extension}} of the tuba family within the modern contrabass tuba. At least five known examples have been created, all pitched in BBBb, sounding <b>a</b> full <b>octave</b> lower than standard BBb contrabass tubas. Music for them is written in bass clef sounding <b>a</b> full <b>octave</b> lower than notated.|$|R

5|$|Around 1865 John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar {{physical and chemical properties}} that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music, where notes <b>an</b> <b>octave</b> apart have similar musical functions. His version put all the alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and thallium (which show the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals), together into a group. His table placed hydrogen with the halogens.|$|E
5|$|Berlioz's {{version is}} one of many which combine the Italian and French scores, {{although}} it is the most influential and well regarded. Since about 1870 three-act adaptations of the Berlioz score, translating it back into Italian and restoring much of the music from the 1774 French version which Berlioz had left out, were common. An 1889 edition for contralto, published by Ricordi, became the most popular. On occasion the role of Orfeo has even been transposed down <b>an</b> <b>octave</b> for a baritone to sing. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Hermann Prey are two notable baritones who have performed the role in Germany. Fischer-Dieskau recorded the opera several times; his recordings are still available commercially.|$|E
5|$|The cantata falls {{relatively}} {{early in}} Bach's chronology of cantata compositions. It was possibly composed for 24 February 1715, but more likely {{a year or}} even two earlier. Bach structured the work in five movements, a sinfonia, a recitative, a recitative with chorale, an aria and a closing chorale. He scored it for three vocal soloists, a four-partchoir only in the chorale, and an unusual Baroque instrumental ensemble of four violas, cello, bassoon and basso continuo. When he performed the work again as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, he added two recorders to double viola I and II <b>an</b> <b>octave</b> higher.|$|E
50|$|As a result, in 1954 the boy {{succeeded in}} making kolintang with two and <b>a</b> half <b>octave</b> {{diatonic}} scales. With the instructions elderly residents, he who never {{heard the sound of}} musical instruments kolintang before, continues to learn and develop these instruments and can create a scales of up to three and <b>a</b> half <b>octaves</b> in the 1960s.|$|R

5|$|The second {{version of}} this cantata for a {{performance}} in Leipzig adds two recorders, which double viola I and II <b>an</b> <b>octave</b> higher. John Eliot Gardiner compares the effect to a four-foot stop on a pipe organ. The cantata begins in G minor in the Weimar version, in A minor in the Leipzig version. In the following table of the movements, the scoring and keys follow the Neue Bach-Ausgabe for the Leipzig version. The time signatures are taken from the book on all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, played throughout, is not shown.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, Meshuggah {{undertook}} a short European tour organized by its record label Nuclear Blast. Afterwards, the band {{returned to the}} studio to record the album Destroy Erase Improve at Soundfront Studios in Uppsala, with Daniel Bergstrand as a producer. Shortly thereafter, the band went on a European tour supporting Machine Head for two months. During the tour, Nordin became ill and experienced difficulties with his inner ear balance. Due to the resulting chronic dizziness and vertigo, Nordin {{was forced to leave}} the tour and travel to Sweden. Machine Head's bassist Adam Duce offered to cover his absence; however, Meshuggah decided to continue as a four-piece. Sometimes Thordendal played bass, while other times the band performed with two guitars. In this lineup, Hagström would use a pitch shifter to play his guitar at <b>an</b> <b>octave</b> lower than usual.|$|E
5|$|The accompaniment for a Peking opera {{performance}} usually {{consists of}} a small ensemble of traditional melodic and percussion instruments. The lead melodic instrument is the jinghu, a small, high-pitched, two-string spike fiddle. The jinghu is the primary accompaniment for performers during songs. Accompaniment is heterophonic – the jinghu player follows the basic contours of the song's melody, but diverges in pitch and other elements. The jinghu often plays more notes per measure than the performer sings, and does so <b>an</b> <b>octave</b> lower. During rehearsal, the jinghu player adopts {{his or her own}} signature version of the song's melody, but also must adapt to spontaneous improvisations {{on the part of the}} performer due to changed performance conditions. Thus, the jinghu player must have an instinctive ability to change his or her performance without warning to properly accompany the performer.|$|E

5000|$|The song {{opens with}} <b>an</b> <b>octaved</b> solo piano, {{which is then}} {{accompanied}} by a looped Roland drum machine, with occasional shaker and wind chimes alternating; other keyboards are often layered in shortly after, with a bass guitar mainly accompanying this. It is instrumental until the end, in which the line [...] "Life isn't everything" [...] is repeated over the primary melody.|$|R
5|$|Following the war, one {{important}} research avenue {{was trying to}} increase the design bandwidth of wide-band filters. The approach used at the time (and still in use today) was {{to start with a}} lumped element prototype filter and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form. This approach appeared to be stuck at a minimum Q of five (see Band-pass filters below for an explanation of Q). In 1957, Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype. This prototype was based on quarter wave impedance transformers and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to <b>an</b> <b>octave,</b> corresponding to a Q of about 1.3. Some of Young's procedures in that paper were empirical, but later, exact solutions were published. Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types, such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article. The capacitive gap filter (figure 8) and the parallel-coupled lines filter (figure 9) are examples of directly coupled resonators.|$|E
5|$|Potter, however, did {{not feel}} he fitted into this {{increasingly}} experimental sound the band was developing and tended {{to wait until the}} others had worked out their parts during rehearsals, adding his bass lines on top at the last minute. After recording three tracks of their third album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), he decided to quit the band. His last gig was on 9 August at the 1970 Plumpton Festival. The remaining members auditioned Dave Anderson, roadie for Brinsley Schwarz and friend of the band, but after a week's rehearsal found that things weren't working out musically. Banton, meanwhile, had become influenced by Vincent Crane's work in Atomic Rooster, where Crane played the bass lines on a Hammond organ's bass pedals and suggested that he could do this as well. With just days to go before the next gig, they tried rehearsing as a four-piece, and it was successful. Banton later played bass guitar on certain songs, having already learned the instrument in the mid-1960s, and Hammill expanded his instrumental capabilities on stage to cover piano and keyboards as well as guitar. Jackson modified his saxophones to be completely electric, as opposed to simply being amplified through a microphone, and combined the sound with a wah-wah pedal and <b>an</b> <b>octave</b> divider.|$|E

The alto flute is in the key ofG, and the low register extends to the G below middleC; its highest note is a highG (4ledger lines above the treble staff). The bass flute is <b>an</b> <b>octave</b> lower than the concert flute, and the contrabass flute is <b>an</b> <b>octave</b> lower than the bass flute.|$|E
