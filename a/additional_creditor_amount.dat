50|$|The term {{judgment}} {{proof is}} {{most commonly used}} in tort and contract law contexts to refer to defendants or potential defendants who are financially insolvent. Even if a plaintiff were to secure a legal judgment against an insolvent defendant, the defendant's lack of funds would make the satisfaction of that judgment difficult, if not impossible, to secure.

However, if the debtor is living on income from social security benefits, a retirement pension, or other social welfare, then {{this may not be}} possible, as such income is often subject to legal protections against garnishment by <b>creditors,</b> alternatively, the <b>amount</b> that can be recovered may be insufficient to cover ongoing legal expenses and related costs, making collection attempts uneconomical.|$|R

The amount of the actual payment would be determined from one's spending plan, after subtracting necessary expenses and the amount of money required to support a reasonable quality of life. This amount would then be divided up among the creditors. Ideally, the payment to each creditor is proportional (based on the amount of money owed to the creditor divided by the total liabilities). Creditors should not be given special treatment because they harass a debtor with greater frequency than other creditors. One may, however, give preference to creditors charging higher interest rates, threatening legal action, or who are friends or family members.|$|R
50|$|Soon after, the two railroads went {{bankrupt}} in the Panic of 1857. The bonds were {{sold by the}} original investors to out-of-town speculators at {{a small fraction of}} their face value. Since the railroads were never built and did not produce revenue, the city was unable to pay off the bonds. Moreover, the city did not feel compelled to do so because the creditors (those who held the bonds) were not only from out of town, but weren't even the original holders. Yet the creditors exerted so much pressure on the city to pay off the bonds that Watertown effectively dissolved its government so that there was no legal entity (the government as a whole or officers) that could be served a court order to pay or appear in court. The case was not resolved until 1889, when it had risen {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court of the United States, which essentially dismissed the case of the <b>creditors.</b> A small <b>amount</b> remained to be paid, and this was not paid off until 1905, half a century later.|$|R
5000|$|As bankers, the Frescobaldi financed ventures for {{numerous}} members of European royal families, notably their financial conquest of England, which Fernand Braudel has signalled {{as the greatest}} achievement of the Florentine firms, [...] "not only in holding the purse-strings of the kings of England, but also in controlling sales of English wool which was vital to continental workshops and in particular to the Arte della Lana of Florence." [...] In the 1270s the Frescobaldi opened an office in London and began financing the wars of King King Edward I, eventually supplanting the pioneering Riccardi of Lucca, who were driven to bankruptcy by unpaid loans made to Edward. The Frescobaldi were receivers of the customs of England from 1307, and also served as papal tax gatherers in England, helping to finance the Crusades. With the king's death in 1307, leaving a debt to all <b>creditors</b> that <b>amounted</b> to £30,000 Amedeo de' Frescobaldi continued in the favoured but dangerous position under Edward II; {{with the fall of}} Walter Langton, the royal treasurer, {{at the outset of the}} new reign, the bishop's debtors, many of them Italians, were instructed to render their debts to Frescobaldi; in 1309 he was granted all the wool customs from Ireland and Scotland. The barons' pressure against the influence of foreigners in the king's affairs, exemplified most prominently against the Gascon favourite, Piers Gaveston, swept up Frescobaldi, who at the time of the Ordinances of 1311 was ordered to tally up his accounts by October, and was arrested and all his goods seized. Frescobaldi fled England, first to Papal Avignon and then to Florence. The royal debt was never repaid, and together with other reverses in the economic downturn of the 14th century, led to the bankruptcy of the Frescobaldi.|$|R

For although it may not be practicable to remedy the evils resulting from absenteeism, by compelling Irish proprietors to live in Ireland, the pernicious influence of their absence upon the prosperity of the country, in an economic, as well as in a social, point of view, ought to be mitigated by those who have it in their power to do so; because it is an evil which we are obliged to suffer to a great extent for the benefit of our British fellow-subjects, and as the result of our political relations with them, and therefore we ought to be compensated for its endurance by the enjoyment of some countervailing good...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{amount of}} bad debt and uncollected accounts in {{the banks and}} other creditors have affected the cash inflow very badly. The transformation of bad debt into cash flow is vey crucial for daily business operation or for further expansion in the future. In view of the above, effective collection and recovery of bad debt strategies are {{very important for the}} business to be successful and mitigate losses. Banks and creditors maintain the current recovery model, the in-house collection activities to recover the bad debt. However, in certain circumstances, the amount recovered is not as expected and as such, alternative options are required. The two most feasible and efficient recovery tools are to outsource the bad debt to an established debt collection agency or to sell the bad debt to an interested buyer to maximize the recovery. The procedures, concepts, and workflow including the guidelines of Bank Negara Malaysia involved in all the three options are outlined to have a better understanding and comparison on the different recovery activities. Literature reviews on the causes of bad debt and other recovery tools are discussed with the relevant examples. These bad debt problems are not only affecting Malaysia, but also has been a major problem in the developed and emerging economies. The worldwide financial crisis has affected a lot of banks and other <b>creditors</b> with substantial <b>amount</b> of bad debt.

6000|$|... [48] [In {{consequence}} of the great extension of commerce {{since the time of}} Defoe, a short explanation of the principle and practice of drawing foreign bills of exchange now seems necessary. Foreign bills of exchange are used, {{in order to avoid the}} necessity of transmitting actual money from one country to another. A merchant, for instance, in Nova Scotia, is owing £100 to a manufacturer in Glasgow: he seeks out some one who is a <b>creditor</b> to that <b>amount</b> to some person in Britain; we shall say he finds a captain in the army who wishes to draw £100 from his agent in London. To this captain the Nova Scotia merchant pays £100, and gets his order or bill on the London agent, which bill he sends to the manufacturer in Glasgow, and the manufacturer transmits the bill to London for payment; any banker, indeed, will give him the money for it, deducting a small commission. Thus two debts are liquidated, without the transmission of a farthing in money. The demand for bills in foreign countries to send to Great Britain, has the effect of raising them to a premium, which is called the rate of exchange, and is a burden which falls on the purchaser of the bill. Foreign bills of exchange drawn on parties in Great Britain, have expressed upon them the number of days after sight at which they are to be payable. Thus, a merchant on receiving a foreign bill drawn at 'thirty days after sight,' hastens to get it 'sighted,' or shown to the party on whom it is drawn, and that party accepts it, at the same time marking the date of doing so. The bill is then complete and negociable, and is presented for payment to the acceptor at the end of the time specified, allowing the usual three days of grace. Should the bill not be accepted on being 'sighted,' it is a dishonoured bill, and is returned with a legal protest to the foreign correspondent. To avert, as far as possible, the loss of foreign bills by shipwreck, a set of three bills is drawn for each transaction, called first, second, and third, of the same tenor. For example: 'Thirty days after sight pay this my first bill of exchange, for the sum of £100 sterling; second and third of the same tenor being unpaid.' This first bill is first sent, and by next conveyance the second is sent. Should the first arrive safely, the second, on making its appearance, is destroyed. The third is retained by the foreign correspondent till he hear whether the former two have arrived at their destination, and is sent only if they have been lost. On receiving whichever comes first, it is the duty of the receiver to communicate intelligence of the fact to the sender.] ...|$|R
40|$|For most of {{the period}} {{associated}} with the Industrial Revolution in Britain, English law restricted access to incorporation and the Bubble Act explicitly outlawed the formation of unincorporated joint stock companies with transferable shares. Furthermore, firms in the manufacturing industries most {{closely associated with the}} Industrial Revolution were overwhelmingly partnerships. These two facts have led some scholars to posit that the antiquated business organization law was a constraint on the structural transformation and growth that characterized the British economy during the period. Importantly, however, the vast majority of manufacturing firms in the modern sector were partnerships. An easy explanation for the predominance of partnerships is that the legal restrictions on access to the joint stock form gave entrepreneurs no other choice of legal vehicle for their collective enterprises. It is not a large leap to then argue that these restrictions inhibited the development of the English economy. Those who make this argument implicitly envision a counterfactual in which legal restrictions on the joint stock form were absent, firms in the modern sector used the joint stock form to access external sources of funds to finance investment, and consequently capital accumulation and output accelerated more rapidly in the modern sector. The goal of this Essay is to challenge this view and to point towards other possible explanations for industrial entrepreneurs’ use of the partnership form. In short, the restrictions on access to the joint stock form lacked bite. While firms did not have general access to incorporation until 1844, creative businessmen and lawyers crafted an alternative legal form—the unincorporated joint stock company—that served as a functional replacement for the business corporation. Restrictions on unincorporated joint stock companies were unenforced and largely ignored. Thus, the use of the partnership by entrepreneurs in the modern sector must be understood as a choice; the law did not dictate their firms’ legal form. This Article proposes a resolution of this puzzle based on the pecking order theory of corporate finance. For the vast majority of firms in the modern sector it was optimal to use only debt, not equity, for any external financing. Industrial entrepreneurs chose the partnership form because it minimized the costs of debt financing. The unlimited liability of partners gave firm <b>creditors</b> <b>additional</b> collateral and provided better incentives against opportunism by partners, thereby lowering the cost of credit to the firm. Furthermore, the tighter nexus between control and residual financial claims in the partnership form resulted in better incentives for the owner-managers to exert effort and make efficient decisions in running the firm. Part II begins with a short overview of the early history of the joint stock form in England and then turns to the legal framework for business organization during the Industrial Revolution and explain that the supposed restrictions on organizing as a joint stock company were not binding. Part IV develops an explanation based on the pecking order theory of corporate finance for why industrial entrepreneurs nonetheless organized their businesses as partnerships...|$|R
