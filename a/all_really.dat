Music journalist Chris Parkin found the song {{to be the only}} track on Teenage Dream to offer something deep and dark, citing the lyric [...] "You fall asleep during foreplay because the pills you take are more your forté".

500|$|... "Impossible Is Nothing" [...] {{was named}} as one the two worst songs on The New Classic by Devone Jones of PopMatters who criticized Azalea for [...] "literally preaching—to youths, rather than [...] to them".

Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that the song was [...] "sort of blandly inspirational" [...] and [...] "as numbing" [...] as {{material}} by T.I.. While Troy L.

The video starts with the Sugar Lumps as schoolgirls dreaming of becoming Spice Girls, and ends with them joining the group on stage, while dancing and lip-synching the song. Halliwell commented about the shoot: [...] "The women were <b>all</b> <b>really</b> warm and funny and nice. The freakiest thing about it was seeing Jennifer Saunders.

[...] The series itself premiered through the Disney Channel on March 24, 2006, and became an immediate commercial success; with 5.4 million viewers, the pilot episode earned the channel the highest ratings in its history at the time. The following month, it was reported that an accompanying soundtrack and Cyrus' debut studio album had both begun production, the latter of which was scheduled to be released in early 2007.

In the same year, Lazzara answered questions on his Formspring account, commenting that New Again [...] "was a gigantic step backwards" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "not fully satisfied with what we put out". In 2012, Reyes said of New Again: [...] "I didn't like how we had to constantly change producers and the songwriting didn't turn out originally as it was, it just kind of bummed us out a bit." [...] Discussing New Again in 2016, Rubano called the period [...] "the golden time where I was like 'oh, we're doing music, that we <b>all</b> <b>really</b> like, that we can't wait to get out' and things were going pretty good for a little while".

500|$|... "Reunion" [...] is a noirish ballad that {{features}} reactive emotions by the narrators. Smith approached its recording {{as he would}} remixing a song, working with a demo of bass, guitar, and vocal parts at his own studio and incorporating house and techno elements. Midway, [...] "Reunion" [...] develops a refrain of [...] "did I ... see you ... see me ... in a new light?", and pulsating steel drums lead to a somber, rhythmic dance section. Its pulsating beat transitions into [...] "Sunset", a song about the pain shared by estranged ex-lovers. The song's muted beat adds tension to the narrative, which Calvert interprets to be [...] "the couple's final farewell – the beat serves to denote the passing of time." [...] "Sunset" [...] also has a subtle UK garage beat, funky house elements, and {{was inspired by the}} music from Smith's DJing gigs; Croft cited it as [...] "an example of the idea of a kind of song we're <b>all</b> <b>really</b> into, which is heartbreaking dance music". Consequence of Sound's Harley Brown views that [...] "Reunion" [...] and [...] "Sunset" [...] make up a congruous mix at [...] "the heart of the album", as Smith [...] "indie-streams these house varieties ... slowing down and alienating beats from their context so they’re even more universal, unobscured by their dance floor origins.|$|E
500|$|Co-creator and {{executive}} producer Roberto Orci explained {{in an interview that}} the big reveal {{at the end of the}} episode, in which Olivia meets Bell in the parallel universe, was actually planned for a fourth season, but the writers decided [...] "let's actually answer something instead and not get, not just rely on that mystery forever. And so we actually chose to give kind of a big answer and have to come with a different show than we ever intended". The writers wanted to use an iconic image [...] for the scene, leading to staff writer Andrew Kreisberg's suggestion of the Twin Towers. Wyman first thought it was [...] "the greatest idea in the world" [...] before having doubts that its use would [...] "sensationalize" [...] it. He explained, [...] "But then, when we started thinking about it, we thought collectively America really understood 9/11 is such a monumental moment so we felt it wasn’t exploited but indicative of the times we’re living in right now. We used it and that was the end of the first season and then we were <b>all</b> <b>really</b> thrilled with where it was going." [...] The cast would later recollect on the series, and for Jackson, considered that the show has never [...] "had a better visual or a better cliff-hanger" [...] as this finale.|$|E

[...] SuChin Pak, also from MTV stated the show was [...] "no huge revelation", explaining, [...] "It {{was not the kind of}} show that says: 'She's back. She's going to come out with the biggest album of her career.' Nor did it say that she's lost forever and we'll never see the old Britney back again. These are <b>all</b> <b>really</b> tiny baby steps." [...] Thomas K.

Our culture needs stories like this. Here's hoping Marvel keeps them coming." [...] For Paul Tassi and Erik Kain of Forbes, {{watching}} the series made them question the MCU, with Kain feeling that the [...] "morally complex, violent, dark world of Jessica Jones {{has no place in}} the MCU ... right now, the MCU is holding back shows like Jessica Jones and Daredevil, while those shows are contributing absolutely nothing to the MCU." [...] Tassi {{went so far as to}} wonder what [...] "the point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe" [...] is, lamenting the lack of major crossovers in the franchise since the Winter Soldier reveal on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and saying that Jessica Jones is [...] "so far removed from the world of The Avengers, it might as well not be in the same universe at <b>all</b> ... <b>really</b> don't understand the point of [...] if they're going to keep everything within it separated off in these little boxes". Conversely, Eric Francisco of Inverse called Jessica Joness lack of overt connections to the MCU [...] "the show's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU's scope really is, Jessica Jones also proves the MCU's thematic durability." ...|$|E

The interviewer expressed his surprise at the nomination given Slayer's [...] "inflammatory" [...] lyrics, to which King replied, [...] "That would be the coolest thing, you know? To win with the shit we write about." [...] The ceremony was held on February 11, 2007, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, with Slayer competing against Mastodon, Lamb of God, Ministry and Stone Sour. Slayer won the Best Metal Performance Grammy award, although the band was unable to attend because of a conflicting North American headlining tour. Araya commented about the win from a hotel room in Columbus, Ohio: [...] "Jeff [...] and I put a lot into 'Eyes of the Insane' so we're thrilled that the Grammy voters took the time to listen to it, and then vote for it. We're out here on the road and we're <b>all</b> <b>really,</b> really happy." [...] King disagreed, deeming the song [...] "one of the poorest representations of us [...] on the record [...] ". He further said that, if given the decision, he would have chosen the controversial track [...] "Jihad" [...] to represent Slayer from their ninth album Christ Illusion. Critical of the Recording Academy, King said, [...] "Realistically, I think people on the academy who vote pick the household name ... And that's what we are." ...|$|E
