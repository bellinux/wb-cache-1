The emphasis his family placed on intelligence and his observation of negative stereotypes of Southerners led Colbert to train himself to suppress his Southern accent while he was still quite young.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} the {{complexity}} of bronze reproduction, France has promulgated several laws since 1956 which limit reproduction to twelve casts– the maximum number {{that can be made}} from an artist's plasters <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> considered his work. As a result of this limit, The Burghers of Calais, for example, is found in fourteen cities.|$|E
5|$|A microbrewery, or craft brewery, {{produces}} {{a limited amount}} of beer. The maximum amount of beer a brewery can produce <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> classed as a microbrewery varies by region and by authority, though is usually around 15,000 barrels (1.8 megalitres, 396 thousand imperial gallons or 475 thousand US gallons) a year. A brewpub is a type of microbrewery that incorporates a pub or other eating establishment. The highest density of breweries in the world, most of them microbreweries, exists in the German Region of Franconia, especially in the district of Upper Franconia, which has about 200 breweries. The Benedictine Weihenstephan Brewery in Bavaria, Germany, can trace its roots to the year 768, as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery. The brewery was licensed by the City of Freising in 1040, and therefore is the oldest working brewery in the world.|$|E

5|$|The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover were {{released}} {{together on a}} single reel, approximately 1,000 feet in length, on December 9, 1910. Both films are comedies, but Thanhouser advertisements refer to The Girls He Left Behind Him as a drama. The individual lengths of the reels are not known for certain, but the Thanhouser Company Film Preservation lists The Girls He Left Behind Him as being three-quarters of a reel and The Iron Clad Lover as half a reel in length. This is listed as an approximation of the relative expected lengths of the production, {{which could have been}} about 625 feet and 400 feet in length <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> a single reel. Very few advertisements for the films have been found, but the films likely had a wide national release. One advertisement featuring both films was found in Missouri, but The Girls He Left Behind Him was advertised without its other half and with slightly different spellings in Wisconsin and another Missouri theater. Selig would release a similarly titled work The Girl He Left Behind in 1912.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Kathiawari are unknown. There were {{indigenous}} horses on the western coast of India before the arrival in the early sixteenth century of the Turco-Mongol invaders who later established the Mughal Empire. Beginning during the Mughal reign, and continuing during the British Raj, Arab horses were imported to India and crossed with native stock, creating the ancestors of the modern Kathiawari breed. The Kathiawari may have also {{been influenced by the}} Mongolian horse. Traditionally, noble households specialised in their own strain of horses, naming their lines of horses after a foundation mare; 28 of these lines still exist. These noble houses selectively bred horses that could withstand extreme temperatures and minimal rations, carry a man with weapons and armour for long periods in rough terrain, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> swift and nimble. They bred for wiry, sleek horses that were ideal for war, and Kathiawaris were noted for their loyalty and bravery in battle, often defending their riders even when wounded themselves. This breeding was maintained until the Independence of India.|$|E
5|$|Waller mustered his men in Farnham Park near 10:30p.m., on 12 December. At around midnight, 5,000 of Waller's men marched {{west from}} Farnham toward Basing House. The Parliamentarians marched {{about two miles}} in this {{direction}} (in order to confuse Royalist scouts), until around 1:00a.m., before abruptly turning south toward Alton. The march was quick and quiet, owing to a long frost which had hardened the roads and Waller's judicious use of wooded areas. Also helpful in Waller's advance was his use of leather guns, here employed {{for the first time}} in the English Civil War. Unlike heavier artillery, a leather gun could be led by a single horse, transported efficiently over difficult terrain, <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> an effective tool for bombardment.|$|E

5|$|Yet another {{trait that}} sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live {{twice as long as}} they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (senescence) <b>and</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> capable of reproduction.|$|E
