5|$|If after 2–4days {{there is}} still {{evidence}} of an <b>air</b> <b>leak,</b> various options are available. Negative pressure suction (at low pressures of –10 to –20cmH2O) at a high flow rate may be attempted, particularly in PSP; {{it is thought that}} this may accelerate the healing of the leak. Failing this, surgery may be required, especially in SSP.|$|E
5|$|While TBI may {{be managed}} without surgery, {{surgical}} repair of the tear is considered {{standard in the}} treatment of most TBI. It is required if a tear interferes with ventilation; if mediastinitis (inflammation of the tissues in the mid-chest) occurs; or if subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema progresses rapidly; or if <b>air</b> <b>leak</b> or large pneumothorax is persistent despite chest tube placement. Other indications for surgery are a tear more than one third the circumference of the airway, tears with loss of tissue, and a need for positive pressure ventilation. Damaged tissue around a rupture (e.g. torn or scarred tissue) may be removed in order to obtain clean edges that can be surgically repaired. Debridement of damaged tissue can shorten the trachea by as much as 50%. Repair of extensive tears can include sewing a flap of tissue taken from the membranes surrounding the heart or lungs (the pericardium and pleura, respectively) over the sutures to protect them. When lung tissue is destroyed as a result of TBI complications, pneumonectomy or lobectomy (removal of a lung or of one lobe, respectively) may be required. Pneumonectomy is avoided whenever possible due to the high rate of death associated with the procedure. Surgery to repair a tear in the tracheobronchial tree can be successful even when it is performed months after the trauma, as can occur if the diagnosis of TBI is delayed. When airway stenosis results after delayed diagnosis, surgery is similar to that performed after early diagnosis: the stenotic section is removed and the cut airway is repaired.|$|E

40|$|We {{retrospectively}} {{analyzed the}} characteristics of infants complicated with pulmonary <b>air</b> <b>leaks</b> admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Forty infants with pulmonary <b>air</b> <b>leaks</b> were admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit between 1995 and 2004. The mean gestational ages and birth weights were 36. 7 ± 5. 6 weeks and 2488 ± 942 g, respectively. The number and subtypes of <b>air</b> <b>leaks</b> were as follows: pneumothorax 29 (64 %), pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum 5 (11 %), pneumomediastinum 4 (9 %), pneumopericardium 1 (2. 5 %) and pulmonary interstitial emphysema 1 (2. 5 %). Thirty-six (90 %) infants developed <b>air</b> <b>leaks</b> within 24 hours after birth. The underlying diseases causing <b>air</b> <b>leaks</b> were transient tachypnea of the newborn (26 %), meconium aspiration syndrome (17 %), respiratory distress syndrome (15 %), and so on. Eight infants (17 %) were diagnosed as having spontaneous pneumothorax. Nine cases (22. 5 %) were very low birth weight infants. Premature infants tend to develop <b>air</b> <b>leaks</b> with respiratory distress syndrome, and term infants tend to develop <b>air</b> <b>leaks</b> with meconium asipiration syndrome. Four infants (10 %) developed <b>air</b> <b>leaks</b> while on mechanical ventilators. For treatment, all infants required oxygen administration, and 9 infants improved spontaneously. Pleuracentesis was conducted in 8 infants, and 6 infants required continuous air drainage after pleuracentesis. Mechanical ventilation including nasal CPAP was performed in 23 infants. Intraventricular hemorrhage, which {{is known as a}} major complication of pulmonary <b>air</b> <b>leaks,</b> occurred in 3 infants (7. 5 %). Four infants (10 %) died of the underlying diseases, and 36 infants survived without complications.

40|$|Lung {{recruitment}} during high-frequency ventilation (HFV) in preterm {{infants with}} respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) {{has been associated}} with an increased risk of lung hyperinflation and <b>air</b> <b>leaks.</b> Individualizing the lung recruitment procedure to the severity of lung disease of each patient might reduce these risks. In this prospective cohort study, we evaluated chest X-ray (CXR) characteristics during individualized oxygenation-guided lung recruitment with HFV in preterm infants with RDS, before and after surfactant therapy. Two pediatric radiologists scored radiolucency, the presence of lung hyperinflation, and/or <b>air</b> <b>leaks</b> following lung recruitment during HFV in 69 infants before and 39 infants after surfactant treatment. Following lung recruitment, the median radiolucency score was 2, with 44 (64 %) infants having a score ≤ 2. Only mild to moderate hyperinflation was seen in 13 (19 %) infants, with no <b>air</b> <b>leaks.</b> After the surfactant, the radiolucency score improved in 62 % of 39 paired CXRs (p[*] <[*] 0. 001). Mild to moderate hyperinflation was seen in nine (24 %) patients.

500|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema vary based on the cause, but it {{is often associated with}} swelling of the neck and chest pain, and may also involve sore throat, neck pain, difficulty swallowing, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Chest X-rays may show air in the mediastinum, the middle of the chest cavity. A significant case of subcutaneous emphysema is easy to detect by touching the overlying skin; it feels like tissue paper or Rice Krispies. [...] Touching the bubbles causes them to move and sometimes make a crackling noise. [...] The air bubbles, which are painless and feel like small nodules to the touch, may burst when the skin above them is palpated. [...] The tissues surrounding SCE are usually swollen. [...] When large amounts of <b>air</b> <b>leak</b> into the tissues, the face can swell considerably. [...] In cases of subcutaneous emphysema around the neck, there may be a feeling of fullness in the neck, {{and the sound of the}} voice may change. If SCE is particularly extreme around the neck and chest, the swelling can interfere with breathing. The air can travel to many parts of the body, including the abdomen and limbs, because there are no separations in the fatty tissue in the skin to prevent the air from moving.|$|E
2500|$|The {{surgical}} treatment for velopalatal insufficiency may cause {{obstructive sleep apnea}} syndrome. When velopalatal insufficiency is present, air leaks into the nasopharynx even when the soft palate should close off the nose. A simple test for this condition {{can be made by}} placing a tiny mirror on the nose, and asking the subject to say [...] "P". This p sound, a plosive, is normally produced with the nasal airway closes off - all air comes out of the pursed lips, none from the nose. If it is impossible to say the sound without fogging a nasal mirror, there is an <b>air</b> <b>leak</b> - reasonable evidence of poor palatal closure. Speech is often unclear due to inability to pronounce certain sounds. One of the {{surgical treatment}}s for velopalatal insufficiency involves tailoring the tissue {{from the back of the}} throat and using it to purposefully cause partial obstruction of the opening of the nasopharynx. This may actually cause OSA syndrome in susceptible individuals, particularly in the days following surgery, when swelling occurs (see below: Special Situation: Anesthesia and Surgery).|$|E
2500|$|Following his own {{journey from}} British Airways, to film {{producer}} and director, {{it has always}} been Tristan Loraine's ambition to raise awareness of the issues involving toxic air.

40|$|Objective: Patients {{undergoing}} pulmonary resections often present postoperative <b>air</b> <b>leaks</b> {{of varying}} magnitude and duration; this complication is more frequent with incomplete or absent interlobar fissures. Small leaks close spontaneously within 5 - 7 days; larger leaks may persist longer {{and could be}} associated with increased morbidity and prolonged hospitalization. We evaluated the role of different techniques to complete interlobar fissures before pulmonary lobectomy to prevent postoperative <b>air</b> <b>leaks</b> and reduce hospital stay and costs. Methods: A total of 30 patients undergoing pulmonary lobectomy for lung cancer and presenting incomplete interlobar fissures {{that needed to be}} opened both anteriorly and posteriorly were randomized into three groups. In Group I, fissures were created with a GIA stapler and buttressed with bovine pericardial sleeves. In Group II, we used TA 55 staplers alone; in Group III we used the 'old fashion' cautery, clamps and silk ties. The three groups were homogeneous for age, type of pulmonary resection and stage of the tumor. The duration of postoperative <b>air</b> <b>leaks</b> and hospital stay were compared with the one-way variance analysis. Results: Postoperative <b>air</b> <b>leaks</b> for Groups I, II and III persisted for 2 ± 0. 94, 5. 3 ± 2 and 5. 3 ± 1. 7 days, respectively. Mean hospital stay was 4. 4 ± 0. 96, 7. 8 ± 2. 14 and 7. 2 ± 1. 5, respectively.
