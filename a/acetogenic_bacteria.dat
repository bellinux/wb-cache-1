Tricultures consisting of MPOB, one of the Methanobrevibacter strains, and organisms which are able to convert formate into H 2 plus CO 2 (Desulfovibrio strain G 11 or the homoacetogenic bacterium EE 121) also degraded propionate.

Six reductive <b>acetogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{from a variety}} of ruminal and non-ruminal environments were investigated for their ability to prevent the accumulation of methane when added to rumen fluid incubated in vitro. Acetitomaculum ruminis, Eubacterium limosum strains ATCC 10825 and ATCC 8486, Ruminococcus productus ATCC 35244, and two <b>acetogenic</b> <b>bacteria,</b> Ser 5 and Ser 8 isolated from 20 h old lambs, were grown in media containing glucose. The bacteria retained the ability to produce acetate from H- 2 when incubated in the absence of sugar, while no acetate was produced in the absence of H- 2. When cultures of the acetogens were added to incubations of mixed rumen microorganisms in vitro, providing between 0. 05 and 0. 13 mg of acetogen protein/ml, methane production decreased by about 5 % after 24 h with E. limosum ATCC 8486 and Ser 5, while the other bacteria had no effect on methane production. Increasing the concentration of E. limosum ten-fold did not cause a further decrease in methane production. When E. limosum ATCC 8486 and Ser 5 were added to cultures of mixed ruminal microoganisms in the presence of 2 -bromoethanesulfonic acid, which inhibited methane formation and caused H- 2 to accumulate, both bacteria caused substantial increases in acetate production and decreased H- 2 formation.

Inverted membrane vesicles of A. woodii have a membrane-bound pyrophosphatase that catalyzes pyrophosphate hydrolysis at a rate of 70 – 120 milliunits/mg of protein. Pyrophosphatase activity was dependent on the divalent cation Mg 2 +. In addition, activity was strictly dependent on Na+ with a Km of 1. 1 mm. Hydrolysis of pyrophosphate was accompanied by 22 Na+ transport into the lumen of the inverted membrane vesicles. Inhibitor studies revealed that 22 Na+ transport was primary and electrogenic.

These organisms possess the enzyme dichloromethane dehalogenase which, in a glutathione-dependent reaction, converts dichloromethane to inorganic chloride and formaldehyde, a central metabolite of methylotrophic growth. Sequence comparisons have shown that bacterial dichloromethane dehalogenases belong to the glutathione S-transferase enzyme family, and within this family to class Theta.
