5|$|The novel {{follows the}} {{adventure}} of four bears, Kallik (a polar bear), Lusa (<b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>bear),</b> Toklo (a brown bear) and Ujurak (a brown bear).|$|E
5|$|The series {{takes place}} over the span of six books, which are: The Quest Begins, Great Bear Lake, Smoke Mountain, The Last Wilderness, Fire in the Sky, and Spirits in the Stars. The story follows four young bears. Lusa, <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>bear,</b> Kallik, a polar bear, Toklo, a grizzly bear and Ujurak, {{who is able to}} shape-shift into any animal, but remains a brown bear most of the time.|$|E
5|$|Most non-human-related {{mortality}} involves nestlings or eggs. Around 50% of eagles survive {{their first}} year. However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 radio-tagged nestlings survived {{to their first}} year. Occasionally, nestling or egg fatalities are due to nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. Another significant cause of egg and nestling mortality is predation. These have been verified to be preyed by large gulls, corvids (including ravens, crows and magpies), wolverines (Gulo gulo), hawks, owls, eagles, bobcats (Lynx rufus), American black bears (Ursus americanus) and raccoons. If food access is low, parental attendance at the nest may be lower because both parents may have to forage thus resulting in less protection. Nestlings are usually exempt from predation by terrestrial carnivores that are poor tree-climbers, but Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) occasionally snatched nestlings from ground nests on Amchitka Island in Alaska before they were extirpated from the island. The bald eagle will defend its nest fiercely from all comers and has even repelled attacks from bears, having been recorded knocking <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> out of a tree when the latter tried to climb a tree holding nestlings.|$|E

5|$|Like all cats, the jaguar is an obligate carnivore, feeding only on meat. It is an {{opportunistic}} {{hunter and}} its diet encompasses at least 87 species. The jaguar can take virtually any terrestrial or riparian vertebrate found in Central or South America, with {{a preference for}} large prey. The jaguar {{is more of a}} dietary generalist than its Old World cousins: the American tropics have a high diversity of small animals but relatively low populations and diversity of the large ungulates which this genus favors. They regularly take adult caimans, deer, capybaras, tapirs, peccaries, dogs, zorros, and sometimes even anacondas. However, the cat will eat any small species that can be caught, including frogs, mice, birds (mainly ground-based species such as cracids), fish, sloths, monkeys, and turtles; a study conducted in Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, for example, revealed that the diets of jaguars there consisted primarily of armadillos and pacas. Some jaguars will also take domestic livestock. El Jefe, the only jaguar currently living within the territory of the United States, has also been found to kill and eat American black bears, as deduced from hairs found within his scats and the partly consumed carcass of <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> sow with the distinctive puncture marks to the skull left by jaguars. This indicates that jaguars might have once preyed on black bears when the species was still present in the area. Spectacled bears are also known to avoid jaguars, possibly because they may constitute occasional prey items.|$|E
5|$|The first book, The Quest Begins, {{shows how}} {{each of the}} four bears are either {{abandoned}} or separated from their parents. Kallik is separated from her mother and brother when a pod of orcas (killer whales) eat her mother, while her brother was still {{on the other side of}} the canal, thinking they were both dead. After this, Kallik travels to find her brother. Toklo is abandoned by his mother after his brother, Tobi, dies and his mother sees how the salmon is disappearing, and left Toklo to travel alone. Lusa was born and raised in a zoo. Her story intertwines with Toklo's after his mother is brought to the zoo and Lusa hears of the wild. Hoping to leave her home, she escapes the zoo and looks for Toklo. Meanwhile, Toklo finds Ujurak injured and helps him; they begin to travel together. They meet up with Lusa at the end of the book. By Great Bear Lake, the four bears have joined together and they try to go to the Arctic. Although Kallik finds her brother Taqqiq, he has joined a group of bullying bears who kidnap <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> cub. Taqqiq sees that what he did was wrong and joins the questing bears but he soon leaves the group in the third book when he feels he does not belong with them. The remaining four cubs learn of a place called the Last Great Wilderness in the third book, where there is plentiful food and shelter. After defying hardships such as hunger and bear hunters, they finally make it to the Last Great Wilderness. However, even though they are there, Ujurak, who leads the journey, feels that they need to go further, into the Arctic. In Fire in the Sky, the bears leave the Last Great Wilderness and travel towards the Arctic. In the sixth and final book of the first series, Spirits in the Stars, the four bears make it to Star Island, a place where many polar bears live. They find a sick mother polar bear and her cub. The mother dies from sickness and the four bears look after her cub. Toklo finds that he also struggles with his urge to become a brown bear and travel alone. The bears save the polar bears that inhabit Star Island by destroying an oil rig that was poisoning the seals that they eat, but Ujurak dies in an avalanche while saving the others. Yakone, a young white bear who lived on the strange Star Island with the sick bears, is added to the group of bears on the last page of the book.|$|E

2500|$|Asian <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> are reproductively {{compatible}} {{with several other}} bear species, and have on occasion produced hybrid offspring. According to Jack Hanna's Monkeys on the Interstate, a bear captured in Sanford, Florida was {{thought to have been}} the offspring of an escaped female Asian <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> and <b>a</b> male American <b>black</b> <b>bear,</b> and Scherren's Some notes on hybrid bears published in 1907 mentioned a successful mating between <b>an</b> Asian <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> and <b>a</b> sloth bear. In 1975, within Venezuela's [...] "Las Delicias" [...] Zoo, <b>a</b> female <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> shared its enclosure with a male spectacled bear, and produced several hybrid descendants. In 2005, <b>a</b> possible <b>black</b> bear/ sun <b>bear,</b> [...] hybrid cub was captured in the Mekong River watershed of eastern Cambodia.

25|$|At Wisconsin {{football}} {{games in the}} 1920s live mascots were used to inspire fans.

25|$|Black bears {{generally}} {{stay out}} of grizzly territory, but grizzlies may occasionally enter black bear terrain to obtain food sources both bears enjoy, such as pine nuts, acorns, mushrooms, and berries. When <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> sees a grizzly coming, it either turns tail and runs or climbs a tree. Black bears are not strong competition for prey {{because they have a}} more herbivorous diet. Confrontations are rare because of the differences in size, habitats, and diets of the bear species. When this happens, it is usually with the grizzly being the aggressor. The black bear will only fight when it is a smaller grizzly such as a yearling or when the black bear has no other choice but to defend itself. There is at least one confirmed observation of a grizzly bear digging out, killing and eating <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> when the latter was in hibernation.|$|E
25|$|Recent bear {{attacks on}} humans have been {{reported}} from Junbesi and Langtang National Park in Nepal, and occurred in villages {{as well as in}} the surrounding forest. Li Guoxing, the second person in history to have received a facial transplant, was a victim of <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> attack. Nine people were killed by black bears in Japan between 1979–1989, and more recently, in September 2009 it was reported that <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> attacked a group of tourists, seriously injuring four, while they were waiting at a bus station in the built-up area of Takayama, Gifu in central Japan. The majority of attacks tend to occur when black bears are encountered suddenly, and in close quarters. Because of this, black bears are generally considered more dangerous than sympatric brown bears, which live in more open spaces and are thus less likely to be surprised by approaching humans. They are also likely to attack when protecting food.|$|E
