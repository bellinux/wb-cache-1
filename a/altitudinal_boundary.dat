40|$|Due to the {{multiple}} impacts of landform effects, spatial heterogeneity {{and land use}} policies, farmland dynamics in mountainous areas are complicated. This study investigated farmland dynamics based on land use data from a typical mountainous area, Panxi, in China for 1990, 2000 and 2010, discussed the relationship between altitude, slope and farmland changes and presented {{an analysis of the}} driving forces of farmland change. Our findings are as follows: (1) from 1990 to 2010, the area of converted farmland was relatively small (313 km 2), accounting for only 2. 6 % of the region’s farmland. Farmland was mainly converted to forest and grassland {{as a result of the}} Returning Farmland to Forest Program; (2) The spatial distribution of land use types differed significantly. The presence of water bodies influenced farmland and built-up land, while forest and grassland showed “landform-oriented” characteristics. Built-up land was especially variable in distribution, indicating that it was more vulnerable to human activities; (3) The vertical differentiation of farmland changes was obvious. At altitudes 2500 m, this trend reversed. Thus, 2500 m serves as an <b>altitudinal</b> <b>boundary</b> between farmland and forest in Panxi. The largest area of forest-farmland transfer occurred on slopes steeper than 15 °, not 25 °, as defined by China’s policy of Returning Farmland to Forest; (4) The driving forces of farmland changes varied. Decreases in farmland were negatively correlated with proximity to rivers and roads. Increases in farmland were positively related to temperature and negatively related to both population density and altitude...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} coercing or forcing farmers to {{transition}} from shifting agriculture to more sedentary agricultural practices, a process I {{refer to as}} “de-swiddening”, {{has been well documented}} for many decades. Most often this process takes place in the political context of a state’s attempt to make an agricultural system more “legible”, as Scott (1998) has aptly described it. In a more recent context, de-swiddening has actually been taken under the banner of environmental protection. In both instances, institutional bodies which design de-swiddening policies rarely consider its unintended consequences. In China, to prevent erosion in upland regions of the country, the Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Agriculture established the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) in 1998 to pay households not to cut down timber. At the local level, this has effectively created an <b>altitudinal</b> <b>boundary</b> preventing households from cutting any trees above 2000 meters where swiddening practices would traditionally take place. In this paper I plan to show that the policy itself was part of a historical process of the de-swiddening of various ethnic groups in Western China. Such a policy did not develop in a vacuum of knowledge but is connected to a Chinese understanding of intensified agriculture. To demonstrate this I show how the ethno-agricultural system in an Ersu Tibetan community, has been undermined by an adherence to the Chinese state’s interpretation of “scientific agriculture” over the past 80 years. Yet, I also argue that Ersu villagers engage directly with these changes as their own desire to obtain economic wealth has increased in recent decades...|$|E

40|$|Extract] The mountain-top fauna of the Wet Tropic {{region of}} NE Queensland are {{predicted}} {{to be particularly}} vulnerable to increased temperatures associated with global climate change (Williams et al., 2003). Bioclimatic modelling has revelaed the Cophixalus frogs {{to be the most}} severely threatened vertebrate group in the Wet Tropics (Williams et al., 2003). Future monitoring of the Cophixalus frogs requires, amongst other things, knowing the current <b>altitudinal</b> range <b>boundaries</b> of species (Hoskin, 2004; Shoo & Williams, 2004). Many of these range boundaries have recently been clarified (Hoskin, 2004; Shoo & Williams, 2004) compared to earlier estimates (Zweifel, 1985; McDonald 1992), but several gaps remain. In particular the <b>altitudinal</b> range <b>boundaries</b> of the two Cophixalus species found on Thornton Peak remain poorly known...|$|R
40|$|Background Intestinal {{schistosomiasis}} is {{of public}} health importance in Uganda but communities living above 1400 m are not targeted for control as natural transmission is thought unlikely. To assess <b>altitudinal</b> <b>boundaries</b> and at-risk populations, conjoint malacological and epidemiological surveys were undertaken on Mount Elgon (1139 m– 3937 m), in Fort Portal crater lakes and in the Rwenzori Mountains (1123 m– 4050 m). Methods Seventy freshwater habitats [Mount Elgon (37), Fort Portal crater lakes (23), Rwenzori Mountains (8) and Lake Albert (2) ] were inspected for Biomphalaria species. Water temperature, pH and conductivity were recorded. A parasitological examination of 756 schoolchildren [Mount Elgon (300), Fort Portal crater lakes (456) ] by faecal microscopy of duplicate Kato-Katz smears from two consecutive stool samples was bolstered by antigen (urine-CCA dipstick) and antibody (SEA-ELISA) diagnostic assays. Results Biomphalaria spp. was found up to 1951 m on Mount Elgon and 1567 m in the Fort Portal crater lakes. Although no snail from Mount Elgon shed cercariae, molecular analysis judged 7. 1...|$|R
40|$|Active rock glaciers {{are highly}} {{sensitive}} to increasing air temperature in high mountain areas {{due to their}} location near the lower <b>altitudinal</b> <b>boundary</b> of permafrost (Haeberli et al., 2006). Though still sparse, there is first evidence about a climate related impact by rock glaciers on high mountain lake water chemistry in the Alps (Thies et al., 2007). A first study on the potential effects of rock glacier melt waters on the ecological quality of alpine headwater streams was recently conducted at high alpine freshwaters in the Oetztal Alps (Tyrol, Austria). It revealed pronounced differences in chemical properties, species composition and biodiversity of epilithic diatoms in streams emerging from two active rock glaciers and in adjacent unaffected reference streams (Thies et al., 2013). The streams impacted by active rock glaciers are characterized by high electrical conductivity (EC) values, but differ in acidity, heavy metal concentrations and by the proportion of acidophilous and acidobionthic diatoms. On the contrary, all reference streams exhibit low EC and circumneutral to slightly acidic pH values (characteristic for surface waters on crystalline bedrock), with no detectable heavy metals and a diatom composition typical for high altitude softwater streams. Differences in diatom diversity between impacted and reference streams are not univocal, as they largely depend on the abundance {{of a set of}} taxa with different tolerance toward water acidity and mineralization level. Within the project Interreg IV Italy-Austria PERMAQUA (ID 5302) the study was extended to permafrost impacted running waters and lakes located in different siliceous mountain districts of North and South Tyrol, in order to better understand diatom responses to melting permafrost. Due to their remoteness these headwaters can be characterized as almost pristine without any direct anthropogenic impact like domestic sewage, mining, agriculture or settlements. Land use is restricted to summer grazing by some sheep or horses. Both permafrost affected and reference springs, streams, lakes and ponds were investigated in late summer for water chemistry, species composition and diversity of periphytic diatoms. The study confirms a clear response of diatom species composition to permafrost driven changes in water mineralization level and acidit...|$|E
40|$|Glaciological {{observations}} on the high plateau were made along a route of the oversnow traverse by the 26 th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition in 1985. The shape of the domelike plateau (Valkyrjedomen), which is the second highest in Antarctica, and the position of ice divides have been known more than before. The highest place of this dome was found at 77 ° 22 ′S, 39 ° 37 ′E with an altitude of 3807 m {{by the use of}} Navy Navigation Statellite System. The surface slope, net accumulation, configuration of snow surface, ram hardness, 10 m snow temperature and others were observed. From these results, the characteristics of katabatic winds region were not found in the region higher than the altitude around 3400 - 3600 m, which was about 400 m higher than such altitude in the case of Mizuho Plateau. Surface slopes change to less than 2 ×(10) ^ in the higher area from such <b>altitudinal</b> <b>boundaries</b> in both cases of the present study and Mizuho Plateau. From the observation of surface configuration, it was known that the directions of prevailing winds changed from southeast in the katabatic winds region to northeast around the highest place of the dome. On the basis of these results, patterns of atmospheric circulation over the plateau and its relation with the glaciological aspects are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{abundance}} {{surveys of}} microhylid frogs across altitudinal gradients within the Wet Tropics rainforests of north-eastern Australia were undertaken. Detailed patterns of abundance were resolved for nine microhylid species exhibiting differing associations within the altitudinal gradient. The position of <b>altitudinal</b> range <b>boundaries</b> {{was found to}} be largely consistent with previous accounts in the literature, providing confidence in established limits to species distributions. Microhylid frogs, in particular those species restricted to mountaintops, are considered among other endemic rainforest vertebrates within the region {{to be one of the}} groups most immediately threatened by climate change. The combined results establish important baseline data for assessing the impacts of climate change, including altitudinal shifts in distribution and localised declines in abundance, on microhylid frogs in the region.

40|$|In {{the light}} of changes in land use and natural forest {{structures}} within the habitats of capercaillie and other grouse species within their European distribution range {{over the last four}} decades, we have investigated the permanent decline in population densities of these species and their gradual disappearance along the latitudinal and <b>altitudinal</b> <b>boundaries</b> of their ranges. Regional differences in forest and hunting management systems and in the interpretation and application of the multipurpose use of forest ecosystems in diverse landscapes throughout Europe, results in variations in {{the degree to which the}} natural forest biodiversity is preserved. Capercaillie is classified as one of the key species for biodiversity control in maintaining multipurpose conatural forest management in boreal and mountain forests of mixed coniferous trees: It has been recognized as an indicator species for primary or secondary forests with natural form and structure and as an indicator of various levels of biodiversity and conservation need. Capercaillie distribution and population density monitoring is used as the main tool for monitoring the species’ forest ecosystems, together with landscapes changes and habitat suitability (e. g. Eiberle 1984; Wegge 1985; Rolstad and Wegge 1987, 1989; Schroth 1995; Beškarev et al. 1995; Čas 1996, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2006, Storch 1999, 2002, 2007, Klaus et al. 1997, Čas and Adamič 1998, Angelstam 1999, 2004; Angelstam and Lazdinus 2000; Mikusinski et al. 2001, Angelstam and Čas 2002; Perco 2002, Sjoberg and Ahlen 2002, Spidso et al. 2002, Sachot et al. 2003, 2006, Saniga 2004, Pakkala et al. 2003, Suter et al. 2002, Menoni et al. 2002, Kutnar et al. 2005, Roberg and Angelstam 2006, Duriez et al. 2007). Analyses of hunting statistics can only be used as general tools for monitoring the species’ population dynamics in countries with hunting in optimal parts of its range, or in countries where the species is endangered and where no data is available on monitoring about endangerment and no protection laws...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} based on the major part of the {{bryophyte}} material collected during the Koponen-Norris expedition on the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea, in 1981. Only taxa which were collected at least twice are included. Five <b>altitudinal</b> zones, the <b>boundaries</b> of which are indicated by discontinuities in the bryophyte flora, are distinguished: 0 - 300 m, 300 - 1200 m, 1200 - 2200 (- 2300) m, 2200 (- 2300) - 2800 (- 2900) m, and 2800 (- 2900) - 3400 m. These zones, each characterized by a typical species assemblage, are well in accordance with some earlier New Guinean zonation schemes based on the phanerogamic flora and vegetation. The most obvious correlations between bryophytes’ altitudinal ranges on the Huon Peninsula and their general phytogeography are: New Guinean or Western Melanesian endemics, as well as Malesian endemics, are concentrated at relatively high altitudes (zones III-V); Asian - Oceanian and Asian - Oceanian - Australian taxa, notably mosses, are relatively strongly represented at low to moderate altitudes (zones I-III); species which have their main distribution in the northern hemisphere occur at high altitudes; 'cosmopolitan' species either have wide vertical ranges or are restricted to high altitudes...|$|R
