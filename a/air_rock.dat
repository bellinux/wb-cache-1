5|$|Many {{meanings}} {{have been}} suggested for the advent and nature of prehistoric art. It may have helped develop human solidarity in its early stages. Open <b>air</b> <b>rock</b> art may have acted as signposts for the route of animal migrations. Cave art {{may have had a}} ritual role in rites of initiation, vision quests or totemic ceremonies. Portable objects may have acted as notation systems and anthropomorphic figures may have had a role in religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.|$|E

25|$|A second {{engine shaft}} (known as the Lucy Engine Shaft) was begun in 1871 from the Lucy Tongue Level, and in 1874 work {{began on the}} 20Fathom Level (also known as No.1Level). A {{hydraulic}} winding engine and a water pump were installed {{at the top of}} the shaft in 1875. Over time this shaft was deepened to the 40Fathom Level (or No.2Level), and in 1890 to the 60Fathom Level. This shaft was sunk in the hard footwall rock west of the vein, and proved to be very hard work. Compressed <b>air</b> <b>rock</b> drills and dynamite were used for the first time at the mine. Before this, all shot holes had been bored by hand and charged with gunpowder. The 40Fathom Level was the first to encounter the Middle Ore Shoot, where the most solid galena ever seen in the Greenside Vein was found, though at greater depths this ore shoot was variable in its quality.|$|E

25|$|Energy from {{a nuclear}} {{explosive}} is initially released in several forms of penetrating radiation. When {{there is a}} surrounding material such as <b>air,</b> <b>rock,</b> or water, this radiation interacts with and rapidly heats it to an equilibrium temperature (i.e. so that the matter {{is at the same}} temperature as the atomic bomb's matter). This causes vaporization of surrounding material resulting in its rapid expansion. Kinetic energy created by this expansion contributes to the formation of a shockwave. When a nuclear detonation occurs in air near sea level, much of the released energy interacts with the atmosphere and creates a shockwave which expands spherically from the center. Intense thermal radiation at the hypocenter forms a nuclear fireball and if the burst is low enough, it is often associated with a mushroom cloud. In a burst at high altitude, where the air density is low, more energy is released as ionizing gamma radiation and x-rays than an atmosphere-displacing shockwave.|$|E
