40|$|In this Article Professor Block-Lieb {{critically}} {{examines the}} power of a federal district or bankruptcy court to adjudicate jurisdictionally insufficient claims which arise out of a common nucleus of operative fact with a proceeding which “arises under” the Bankruptcy Code, or “arises in” or “relates to” a bankruptcy case. After considering Article III of the United States Constitution, relevant statutory provisions [...] including the newly enacted supplemental jurisdictional provision (28 U. S. C. § 1367) [...] and the conflicting policy objectives of these statutory provisions, the Article concludes that a district court 2 ̆ 7 s <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> supplemental claims related to a “related to” proceeding may be unconstitutional, unauthorized by statute, and inconsistent with the primary purpose <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> jurisdiction [...] the efficient administration <b>of</b> a <b>bankruptcy</b> estate. As to a district court 2 ̆ 7 s exercise of jurisdiction over supplemental claims related to an “arising under” or “arising in” proceeding, it proposes that a balancing approach be adopted. It also contends that additional constitutional concerns are raised when a non-Article III bankruptcy court exercises any form <b>of</b> supplemental <b>bankruptcy</b> jurisdiction, and advocates limiting the power <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> courts accordingly...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} {{discussed in}} this research are: first, how {{is the relationship between}} liquidation concept and the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> solvable and viable (prospective) companies in Indonesia? Second, how is the attitude of the Supreme Court towards the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> solvable companies in Indonesia? Third, how is the ideal concept of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s corporate bankruptcy law in the future? This was a normative research. This research concludes, first, there is a relationship between the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> solvable and viable (prospective) companies in the Commercial Court and liquidation concept implemented in Bankruptcy Law. Second, related to the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> solvent companies in the Commercial Court, the Supreme Court calls off the <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> the Commercial Court according to several considerations, including the fact that the companies are still prospective and deserve an opportunity to continue their business and the bankruptcy proposal cannot be proven in a simple way. Third, the ideal concepts of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s bankruptcy law in the future are (i) Separating the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> corporate and individual. (ii) Insolvent becomes a standard <b>of</b> corporate <b>bankruptcy.</b> (iii) Implementing the principles of business continuity which becomes a concept of corporate rescue in the norm <b>of</b> Corporate <b>Bankruptcy</b> Law or Limited Liability Company Acts.

50|$|Brennan {{held that}} the dispute in {{question}} here was an adjudication of private rights, because it involved the restructuring of creditor-debtor relations under the bankruptcy laws. Thus, {{none of the three}} exceptions to Article III jurisdiction were applicable. He further held that Congress’ power under the Naturalization and Bankruptcy Clause (Art. I, § 8, cl.4) of the Constitution did not carry with it a power to create specialized tribunals for the <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> cases. Brennan feared that reading such a power into Article I would erode the jurisdiction conferred by Article III and displace the judicial branch of the government.|$|E

40|$|Conditions for <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyse {{conditions}} for <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy.</b> My thesis {{is composed of}} nine chapters, each of them dealing with {{different aspects of the}} conditions for adjudication bankruptcy. Chapter One is an introduction and defines my motivation for writing about conditions for <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy.</b> I have chosen this topic because I'm interested in the issue of insolvency law. In my opinion, this is really an up to date topic, as there are recently more and more people and companies which are in financial trouble. Chapter Two is subdivided into two subchapters. Subchapter One defines the term of bankruptcy and the development of its meaning over the years. Subchapter Two describes the systematic of the Insolvency Act (Act No. 182 / 2006 Coll. On Insolvency and its Settlement Methods) and explains the classification of bankruptcy within the Act. Chapter Three covers the historical development of the conditions, starting in 1781 with Josephine Bankruptcy Act. It provides a short illustration of the transformation in the conditions for <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> over the past years. Chapter Four characterises the conditions for <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> and enumerates them. This chapter generally divides the conditions to the substantive [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Nigeria arguably {{has one of}} {{the largest}} economies in Africa and boasts of a high level of {{economic}} activity. This is in part attributable to a large population of 160 million, with most being youths (65 %). It would be expected that due to the high level of economic activity, there would be a workable and practical system for indebted consumers to obtain debt relief. Paradoxically, Nigeria boasts of a bankruptcy practice system that is comatose and non-existent. Laws regulating bankruptcy in Nigeria have been in existence in Nigeria since 1979 and are entrenched in the Bankruptcy Act. However, the nation is yet to record a successful case of bankruptcy through the available legal channels. A plethora of problems are responsible for the dire state of insolvency practice in Nigeria. These problems include the present legislative frame work, problems of obsolete laws, judicial attitudes, problems of enforcement, challenge of overburdened courts, to mention but a few. The Bankruptcy Act provides for bankruptcy proceedings as a major debt relief measure available to a consumer debtor and composition and re-arrangement as alternative debt relief measures to bankruptcy. These debt relief measures are said to be cumbersome in nature as the Bankruptcy Act provides that debt must first be judicially established in a separate proceeding before bankruptcy proceedings can be instituted against a debtor. Also, the Bankruptcy Act does not provide for adequate debt relief measures for consumer debtors. For instance, in New Zealand, England and Wales, there is a debt relief measure for debtor’s that do not have assets or income that is the No Income No Assets (NINA) debtors. Provision for this category of debtors is not available in Nigeria. This work is a comparative study of consumer debt relief measures in South Africa, Denmark and New Zealand and is intended to highlight the strengths of these systems so that Nigeria can learn from them and fashion out a better debt relief system from the findings made. This work seeks to make recommendations and propose reforms for a better debt relief system principally through the amendment of the present Bankruptcy Act. Also that the Nigerian system must provide for a comprehensive and unified bankruptcy legislation that makes provision for non-judicial and viable alternative debt relief measures other than bankruptcy proceedings. This would give a consumer debtor the opportunity to choose the most appropriate procedure that would grant relief from indebtedness. These non-judicial procedures would also help solve the problem of over burdening of the courts, enhance speedy <b>adjudication</b> <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> matters and make debt relief measures available to a consumer debtor at little or no cost. Furthermore, the work also incorporates recommendations from the International Association of Restructuring, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Professionals (INSOL International) Consumer Debt Report and the World Bank report on ―The treatment of the insolvency of natural persons‖. These recommendations propose policy guidelines for insolvency reforms in nations of the world and gives practical suggestions on how to make these procedures less cumbersome and readily available for debtors.
