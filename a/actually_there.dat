5|$|At this point, Australian {{fears of}} a Japanese counterattack grew and they {{requested}} reinforcements from their higher commander, General Douglas MacArthur. However, the request was denied as MacArthur's intelligence staff believed that there were only 350Japanese in the vicinity. <b>Actually,</b> <b>there</b> were already 5,000Japanese around Sattelberg and Finschhafen while throughout early October this number grew to 12,000 {{as they began to}} prepare for their planned counterattack. The Australians received some reinforcements {{in the shape of the}} 2/43rd Infantry Battalion. The arrival of this unit meant that the 2/17th, deadlocked around Jivevaneng, could be freed for the advance on Finschhafen, thus enabling the entire 20th Brigade to concentrate on that objective.|$|E

The 20th Infantry Brigade then linked up with the 22nd Infantry Battalion, a Militia infantry battalion that had cleared the coastal area in the south of the Huon Peninsula, advancing from Lae over the mountains. The Japanese withdrew into the mountains around Sattelberg.|$|E
5|$|Geometrical optics {{provides}} further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, {{the wave}} nature of light is neglected. The {{result is a}} model in which light rays are indeed geometrical rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, the action of a lens or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes {{the properties of the}} optical element. <b>Actually,</b> <b>there</b> are two kinds of matrices, viz. a refraction matrix describing the refraction at a lens surface, and a translation matrix, describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, where another refraction matrix applies.|$|E

Sean Connery never travelled to Florida to film Goldfinger because he was filming Marnie elsewhere in the United States. On the DVD audio commentary, director Guy Hamilton states that other than Cec Linder who played Felix, none of the main actors in the Miami sequence were <b>actually</b> <b>there.</b> Connery, Gert Frobe, Shirley Eaton, Margaret Nolan who played Dink, and Austin Willis, who played Goldfinger's card victim, all filmed their parts on a soundstage at Pinewood Studios when filming moved there. Miami also served as location to the scenes involving Felix's pursuit of Oddjob.|$|E

25|$|The CMB {{essentially}} {{confirms the}} Big Bang theory. In the late 1940s Alpher and Herman reasoned {{that if there}} was a big bang, {{the expansion of the universe}} would have stretched and cooled the high-energy radiation of the very early universe into the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and down to a temperature of about 5K. They were slightly off with their estimate, but they had exactly the right idea. They predicted the CMB. It took another 15 years for Penzias and Wilson to stumble into discovering that the microwave background was <b>actually</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

The citation explicitly refers to the year that this event happened, 670 of the Seleucid era, which corresponds to 358/9 CE. The Molad of Tishrei for that year 4119 would be Sat 23 hours and 233 parts. Under the Gregorian calendar this would be Sat, Sept 20, 0358 17:12. Rosh Hashanah would have begun Friday evening but not before, according to lunar science, a very bright Old Moon will rise Friday morning at 4:11 AM, an hour and 34 minutes before sunrise. The significance {{of this can be}} found in the Talmud Rosh Hashanah 25a.|$|E
25|$|As tempting {{as it may}} be to thus view St. Margaret as a {{granddaughter of}} another famous saint, Stephen of Hungary, this popular {{solution}} fails to explain why Stephen's death triggered a dynastic crisis in Hungary, or at least that Agatha's family failed {{to play a role in}} that strife. If St. Stephen and Giselle were indeed Agatha's parents, her offspring would have had a strong claim to the Hungarian crown. <b>Actually,</b> <b>there</b> is no indication in Hungarian sources that any of Stephen's children outlived him. Likewise, all of the solutions involving Henry II would seem to make Agatha much older than her husband, and prohibitively old at the time of the birth of her last child, Edgar.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some debate}} about the exact date the club was founded. Some {{authorities}} think {{it may have been}} as early as 1898 due to the existence of papers addressed to Joseph Whitaker, English consul in Palermo and originally believed to be first club president, about a Palermitan football team founded in the month of April of that year. <b>Actually,</b> <b>there</b> is a probable misinterpretation of some sources: in April 1897, the future founders of Palemo Calcio founded the association Sport Club. The most common and officially stated foundation date is 1 November 1900, as the Anglo Palermitan Athletic and Football Club. The club is thought to have been founded by Ignazio Majo Pagano, a young Palermitan colleague of Whitaker who had discovered football while at college in London, where the modern game of football originated from. The initial staff comprised three Englishmen and nine natives of Palermo, with Whitaker as honorary chairman, Edward De Garston as inaugural president and with red and blue as the original team colours. The first recorded football match, played by the team on 30 December 1900, ended in a 5–0 defeat to an unidentified amateur English team. The first official match, played on 18 April 1901 against Messina Football Club, ended in a 3–2 win to the Palermitan side.|$|E

The most commonly seen in the series is the simple creation of s [...] causing the targeted person(s) to hear, see, smell, taste, or feel sensations that are not <b>actually</b> <b>there</b> in order to manipulate them. Most genjutsu affects the five senses, though other applications of genjutsu exist. Those {{under the influence of}} genjutsu usually freeze in place or lose consciousness, depending on how capable they are in recognizing and defending against it. Depending on the purpose of the genjutsu, one could be running or jumping while under the genjutsu (as seen when Itachi uses genjutsu on Naruto in Part II, when he used the Rasengan on Itachi, only to find out it had been genjutsu and he had used it on air). A genjutsu can be broken in one of three ways. The first is , a disruption of the victim's chakra flow either by themselves or their allies. Pain that is not a result of the genjutsu, such as stabbing oneself, is a second method of countering genjutsu. Finally, if the user of the genjutsu loses focus for whatever reason, the jutsu will end and the victim is freed.|$|E
