Tradition prevailed in the house, with a collegiate atmosphere as gowns were expected to be worn to dinner <b>and</b> <b>lectures</b> and curfews were enforced.|$|E

5|$|The {{popularity}} of the films, operas, plays, concerts <b>and</b> <b>lectures</b> presented at the Zion Cinema turned Zion Square into the “center of cultural life in Jerusalem” in the 1920s and 1930s.

5|$|Feynman was a keen popularizer {{of physics}} through both books <b>and</b> <b>lectures,</b> {{including}} a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume {{publication of his}} undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think? and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.|$|E
5|$|For {{its first}} 30 years, the chapel {{was used as}} a college library and for holding daily chapel services.

The chapel is available to students, alumni, and faculty of all faiths, and a variety of services are held throughout the academic term.

5|$|In January 1953, Nasser overcame {{opposition}} from Naguib and banned all political parties, creating a one-party system under the Liberation Rally, a loosely structured movement whose chief {{task was to}} organize pro-RCC rallies <b>and</b> <b>lectures,</b> with Nasser its secretary-general. Despite the dissolution order, Nasser was the only RCC member who still favored holding parliamentary elections, according to his fellow officer Abdel Latif Boghdadi. Although outvoted, he still advocated holding elections by 1956. In March 1953, Nasser led the Egyptian delegation negotiating a British withdrawal from the Suez Canal.|$|E
5|$|In Swansea's {{maritime}} quarter are the Dylan Thomas Theatre, {{home of the}} Swansea Little Theatre {{of which}} Thomas was once a member, and the former Guildhall built in 1825 and now occupied by the Dylan Thomas Centre, a literature centre, where exhibitions <b>and</b> <b>lectures</b> are held and setting for the annual Dylan Thomas Festival. Outside the centre stands a bronze statue of Thomas, by John Doubleday. Another monument to Thomas stands in Cwmdonkin Park, one of his favourite childhood haunts, close to his birthplace. The memorial is a small rock in an enclosed garden within the park inscribed with the closing lines from Fern Hill.|$|E
5|$|Stanley Halls (in South Norwood) {{were opened}} on 2 February 1903 by Charles Ritchie, 1st Baron Ritchie of Dundee {{at a cost}} of £13,000 (as Stanley Public Hall) to provide the local {{community}} with a public space for plays, concerts <b>and</b> <b>lectures.</b> It was the first building in Croydon to have electricity. In 1904 a clock tower and a hall were added. In 1993, a blue plaque was installed on a wall of Stanley Halls by English Heritage. The plaque reads W.F.R. STANLEY (1829–1909) Inventor, Manufacturer and Philanthropist, founded and designed these halls and technical school. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

5|$|The festival {{programme}} {{consisted of}} discussions on {{subjects such as}} Globalisation, the writer and the nation; Women's writing: what is it and do women want it?; Media Culpa: Does the media fail literature in the UK and India? Debates, book readings, Q sessions <b>and</b> <b>lectures</b> were also held. The most entertaining debate was on the subject 'Humanity, fallibility and truth in contemporary politics' Vir Sanghvi chaired the debate with Clare Short, Rory Stewart and Shashi Tharoor.|$|E
5|$|Winchelsey was {{a preacher}} of some note, and when preaching at St. Paul's he {{attracted}} large crowds to his sermons <b>and</b> <b>lectures.</b> Winchelsey's theological writings date primarily from {{his time at}} St. Paul's, where he delivered a number of quodibeta. The quaestiones disputatae from those sessions survive, and illustrate his highly orthodox trinitarian views and his scholastic method. Miracles {{were said to have}} been worked at his tomb in Canterbury cathedral, but efforts to have him declared a saint have been unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} middle-class English family in Calcutta, British India, Murray divided her youth between India, Britain, and Germany, {{training}} {{as both a}} nurse and a social worker. Moving to London, in 1894 she began studying Egyptology at UCL, developing a friendship with department head Flinders Petrie, who encouraged her early academic publications and appointed her Junior Professor in 1898. In 1902–03 she took part in Petrie's excavations at Abydos, Egypt, there discovering the Osireion temple and the following season investigated the Saqqara cemetery, both of which established her reputation in Egyptology. Supplementing her UCL wage by giving public classes <b>and</b> <b>lectures</b> at the British Museum and Manchester Museum, {{it was at the}} latter in 1908 that she led the unwrapping of Khnum-nakht, one of the mummies recovered from the Tomb of the Two Brothers– {{the first time that a}} woman had publicly unwrapped a mummy. Recognising that British Egyptomania reflected the existence of a widespread public interest in Ancient Egypt, Murray wrote several books on Egyptology targeted at a general audience.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, the Manhattan Valley {{neighborhood}} (then {{known as}} Bloomingdale), where the Master Building is located, saw its culturally-oriented middle class renters depart. Many of them, it was said, opted to buy {{houses in the}} suburban New York metropolitan area. As a consequence, the museum and cultural center lost their audience and in 1971 {{they were forced to}} close. Their holdings were donated to Brandeis University and cultural initiatives such as the Master Institute Chorus, founded in 1960, either folded, or, {{as in the case of}} the chorus, became affiliated with other organizations, such as the New Amsterdam Singers. The Horches' daughter, Oriole, became advisory consultant for the collection at Brandeis. The building's auditorium continued to present concerts, plays, readings, <b>and</b> <b>lectures</b> in the 1940s and into the 1950s. From 1961 through 1978 the Equity Library Theater leased it for productions showcasing the talents of New York actors.|$|E
5|$|Henry was an intellectual. The first English king with {{a modern}} humanist education, he read and wrote English, French and Latin, and was {{thoroughly}} {{at home in}} his well-stocked library. He personally annotated many books and wrote and published one of his own. To promote the {{public support for the}} reformation of the church, Henry had numerous pamphlets <b>and</b> <b>lectures</b> prepared. For example, Richard Sampson's Oratio (1534) was an argument for absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent from Rome. At the popular level, theatre and minstrel troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices: the pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils, while the glorious king was hailed as a brave and heroic defender of the true faith. Henry worked hard to present an image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Thurman and {{her husband}} moved to San Francisco. She wrote several {{articles}} about their Asian trip, analyzing information, discussing their meeting with Gandhi and pressing for scholarship exchanges for negro students at Indian universities. It was from the Thurmans and their talks and writings that Martin Luther King Jr. learned of non-violent resistance {{as a means of}} social protest. By 1944, the church which they had envisioned after their meeting with Gandhi became a reality when they, along with Fisk, opened the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples. It was the first interracial, non-denominational church in the United States. While her husband assumed the pastoral duties, Thurman organized forums <b>and</b> <b>lectures</b> for the members to learn about other peoples such as Native Americans, Africans, Asians and their cultures, covering everything from the Jews to the Navajos.|$|E
