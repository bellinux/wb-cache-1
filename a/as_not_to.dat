5|$|In 1945, Polish Eastern Borderlands were annexed into Soviet Ukraine and the family, {{like many}} other Poles, was resettled to Kraków, where Lem, at his father's insistence, took up medical studies at the Jagiellonian University.

He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E

Venu and Seetha realize that Murali had sacrificed his life for their happiness and remains in their hearts.|$|E

5|$|The Queen, {{influenced}} by the Munshi, continued to write to Lord Lansdowne {{on the issue of}} Tyler's promotion and the administration of India. She expressed reservations on the introduction of elected councils on the basis that Muslims would not win many seats because they were in the minority, and urged that Hindu feasts be re-scheduled so <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> conflict with Muslim ones. Lansdowne dismissed the latter suggestion as potentially divisive, but appointed Tyler Acting Inspector General of Prisons in September 1889.|$|E

5|$|A {{campaign}} {{to send an}} American side to the 1920 games in Antwerp started in California after a Berkeley rugby union touring party returned from British Columbia undefeated in 1920. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) granted permission for entry. A pool of players from Stanford, Berkeley, and Santa Clara made up the squad. 1908 champion Danny Carroll, a player-coach at Stanford at the time, was the team's most prominent member. When the U.S. arrived in Antwerp, the Czechoslovakian and Romanian teams had withdrawn, leaving only France and the United States. The English RFU {{had decided not to}} enter a team, so <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> interfere with the start of the English domestic season.|$|E
5|$|A {{free agent}} in March 2001, Henderson {{returned}} to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke Babe Ruth's record of 2,062 career walks, Ty Cobb's record of 2,245 career runs, and Zack Wheat's record of 2,328 career games in left field, and {{on the final day}} of the season collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson. That final game was also Padre Tony Gwynn's last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play. After scoring the game's first run, Henderson was removed from the lineup. With Gwynn having 3,141 hits, it was just the second time in Major League history that a pair of teammates each had 3,000 career hits; Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker had previously played many games together for the 1928 A's.|$|E

Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its aim was to identify the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, so <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> prejudice further legal proceedings.|$|E

5|$|A {{radical change}} of tactics, which {{involved}} {{the introduction of}} a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was a shrewd move, since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> draw any attention to the effect of the bill. The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E

5|$|After Re d'Italia sank, the Italian fleet {{began to}} disengage, with the badly burning Palestro {{trailing}} behind, {{soon to be}} destroyed by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance so <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively.|$|E
