40|$|It is {{well known}} that zeolite LTA {{membranes}} have poor acid resistance although they have been considered the best hydrophilic zeolite membranes for the dehydration of organic aqueous mixtures. In the present work, we develop a simple and effective road to enhance the acidic stability of the zeolite LTA membrane through the depositing of a graphene oxide (GO) layer as an acid-resisting barrier {{on the surface of the}} zeolite LTA membrane. A relatively thin (about 5. 5 mm) but dense and firm LTA@GO composite membrane is obtained by using dopamine as <b>a</b> <b>covalent</b> <b>linker</b> between the zeolite LTA and GO layers. The presence of the protective GO layer effectively inhibits the degradation of the zeolite LTA membrane by acetic acid, which greatly enhances its acid-resistant stability, leading to a high selectivity and stability for the dehydration of acetic acid. For the separation of 95 wt% acetic acid/water mixture at 333 K, the separation factor and flux of the LTA@GO composite membrane are about 400 and 1. 5 kg m(- 2) h(- 1), respectively, and keep almost constant for 168 h...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{strategy}} to strongly and effectively immobilize silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on polyamide thin film composite membranes to endow antibacterial activity. This method relies on the immobilization of relatively large silica particles (SiO 2, similar to 400 nm in diameter), where AgNPs of similar to 30 nm in diameter are tightly and densely bound (AgNP@SiO 2), on the membrane surface using cysteamine as <b>a</b> <b>covalent</b> <b>linker.</b> The formation of multiple Ag-S chemical bonds between a "bumpy" AgNP@SiO 2 and the rough membrane surface provides a great leaching stability of AgNPs and AgNP@SiO 2. AgNP@SiO 2 particles were well distributed over the entire membrane surface without severe aggregation. The surface coverage of the membrane by AgNP@SiO 2 was tuned by adjusting the deposition time and AgNP@SiO 2 particle concentration. The AgNP@SiO 2 -immobilized membrane showed excellent antibacterial properties against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, even with a relatively low particle coverage. Importantly, the separation performance (water flux and salt rejection) of the membrane was not impaired by particle immobilization. These beneficial effects are attributed mainly to the sparse and good distribution of AgNP@SiO 2, which can reinforce the antibacterial activity of AgNPs while having a negligible impact on the hydraulic resistance...|$|E
40|$|Work in {{the area}} of molecule-based {{magnetic}} and/or conducting materials is presented in two projects. The first project describes the use of 4, 4 ’-bipyridine as a scaffold for the preparation of a new family of tetracarboxamide ligands. Four new ligands I-III have been prepared and characterized and the coordination chemistry of these ligands is presented. This project was then extended to exploit 4, 4 ’-bipyridine as <b>a</b> <b>covalent</b> <b>linker</b> between two N 3 O 2 macrocyles. In this respect, three dimeric macrocycles have been prepared IV-VI. Substitution of the labile axial ligands of the Co(II) complex IV by [Fe(CN) 6] 4 - afforded the self-assembly of the 1 -D polymeric chain {[Co(N 3 O 2) H 2 O] 2 Fe(CN) 6 }n• 3 H 2 O that has been structurally and magnetically characterized. Magnetic studies on the Fe(II) complexes V and VI indicate that they undergo incomplete spin crossover transitions in the solid state. Strategies for the preparation of chiral spin crossover N 3 O 2 macrocycles are discussed and the synthesis of the novel chiral Fe(II) macrocyclic complex VII is reported. Magnetic susceptibility and Mössbauer studies reveal that this complex undergoes a gradual spin crossover in the solid state with no thermal hysteresis. Variable temperature X-ray diffraction studies on single crystals of VII reveal interesting structural changes in the coordination geometry of the macrocycle accompanying its SCO transition.

40|$|Fluorescent multi-ring-fused 2 -pyridones, with {{chemical}} resemblance to other biologically active 2 -pyridone systems, were solubilized in spherical micelles {{formed by the}} gangloiside GM 1 and studied {{with respect to their}} spatial localization and rotational mobility. For this, electronic energy transfer between the multi-ring-fused 2 -pyridone (donor) and BODIPY-FL-labeled GM 1 was determined, as well as their fluorescence depolarization. From the obtained efficiency of energy transfer to the acceptor group (BODIPY-FL), either localized in the polar or in the nonpolar part of the ganglioside, it has been possible to estimate the most likely localization of the multi-ring-fused 2 -pyridones. The center of mass of the studied multi-ring-fused 2 -pyridones are located at approximately 33 Å from the micellar center of mass, which corresponds to the internal hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfacial region. At this location, the reorienting rates of the multi-ring-fused 2 -pyridones are surprisingly slow with typical correlation times of 35 - 55 ns.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to the application of a large-scale first-principles approach to study the electronic structure and quantum conductance of realistic nanomaterials. Three systems are studied using Landauer formalism, Green's function technique and maximally localized Wannier functions. The main focus of this thesis lies on clarifying the effect of chemical modifications on electron transport at the nanoscale, as well as on predicting and designing new type of molecular and nanoelectronic devices. In the first study, we suggest and investigate a quantum interference effect in the porphyrin family molecules. We show that the transmission through a porphyrin molecule at or near the Fermi level varies by orders of magnitude following hydrogen tautomerization. The switching behavior identified in porphyrins implies new application directions in single molecular devices and molecular-size memory elements. Moving on from single molecules to a larger scale, we study the effect of chemical functionalizations to the transport properties of carbon nanotubes. We propose several covalent functionalization schemes for carbon nanotubes which display switchable on/off conductance in metallic tubes. The switching action is achieved by reversible control of bond-cleavage chemistry in [1 + 2] cycloadditions, via the 8 p 3 8 s p 2 rehybridization it induces; this leads to remarkable changes of conductance even at very low degrees of functionalization. Several strategies for real-time control on the conductance of carbon nanotubes are then proposed. Such designer functional groups would allow for the first time direct control of the electrical properties of metallic carbon nanotubes, with extensive applications in nanoscale devices. In {{the last part of the}} thesis we address the issue of low electrical conductivity observed in carbon nanotube networks. We characterize intertube tunneling between carbon nanotube junctions with or without <b>a</b> <b>covalent</b> <b>linker,</b> and explore the possibility of improving intertube coupling and enhance electrical tunneling by transition metal adsorptions on CNT surfaces. The strong hybridization between transition metal d orbitals with the CNT [pi] orbitals serves as an excellent electrical bridge for a broken carbon nanotube junction. The binding and coupling between a transition metal atom and sandwiching nanotubes can be even stronger in case of nitrogendoped carbon nanotubes. Our studies suggest a more effective strategy than the current cross-linking methods used in carbon nanotube networks. by Elise Yu-Tzu Li. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The studies {{performed}} {{in this thesis}} {{make a contribution to}} optimize supramolecular synthesis. Therefore, two concepts with high selectivity and efficiency, namely integrative self-sorting and dynamic combinatorial chemistry, were examined. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the self-sorting phenomenon was observed in a mixture of MV 2 +, DHN, CB[7] and CB[8], in which MV 2 + was contained in both resulting complexes. A second self-sorting system was based on the guest 12 +, which was synthesized via the combination of MV 2 + and naphthalene over <b>a</b> <b>covalent</b> <b>linker.</b> Although both CBs prefer the guest 12 + to MV 2 +, self-sorting occurs in an equimolar mixture of all four components. Therefore, the system consisting of MV 2 +, 12 +, CB[7] and CB[8] one of the little examples for type II of the social self-sorting. The both complexes of this system could be converted to one complex (144 +), in which CB[7] and CB[8] were fixed position-specifically (Abb. 7. 1). Thereby, two orthogonal binding sites (MV 2 + and 12 +) were combined in one component (guest molecule from 144 +). A suchlike self-sorting process shows high selectivity and efficiency during the synthesis of hetero[3]pseudorotaxane 144 +. These self-sorting systems are special, because both binding sites contain viologen unit and a naphthalene unit makes the differentiation between the sizes of the both CBs possible, on that the self-sorting was based. According to the complexes from these systems, the concept of the integrative self-sorting could be successfully transferred to water soluble CB complexes. Furthermore, two pseudo[5]-rotaxanes were obtained from a 1 : 1 : 3 mixture of two trivalent guests and CB[8]. The different combinations of ammonium guests and crown ether hosts, which were provided by Dr. Jiang, lead to numerous pseudo[n]rotaxanes. Some of them are still unknown in the literature. Mixing selected guests and hosts lead to the formation of equilibrium between two self-sorting systems, which need the same starting compounds. Although both systems were built up of self-sorting complexes, is only one system favoured. This phenomenon was named as thermodynamic self-sorting reaction (Abb. 7. 2). Overall, a clear tendency was recognized, that the equilibrium favours the reaction site containing the larger total number of supramolecules. These reactions show the possibility, that one self-sorting complex is converted via adding other guests and hosts properly. Besides, it was proved, that entropy can influence quite the self-sorting process and co-decide the type and the number of the complexes. In the second part of the thesis, several imine ligands were synthesized and their behaviour in the formation of metal complexes was examined. The assembly of ligand 130 and Pd(II) ions led selectively to one single complex (136, Abb. 7. 3), while the analogous experiments with other ligands ended in mixtures of different complexes. This indicates that a dynamic combinatorial library (DCL) is very sensible and its composition can be influenced by small changes. A DCL can also be built up of one single complex, without artificial control. In complex 136, two orthogonal binding sites (imine bonds and coordinative bonds) make together a contribution to holding the structure of the complex. In addition, complex 136 was also gained from a mixture of Pd(II) ions and the starting reagents for the synthesis of ligand 130. In this case, one supramolecule was assembled effectively from 21 small components. The complex 136 shows certain stability and its building process is similar to „subcomponent self-assembly“. Thereby, time and resource can be saved and the efficiency of the supra-molecular synthesis enhances. In the last part of the thesis, complexes of modified perylene tetracarbonate diimide ligands (172 and 173) and different metal ions were analysed by mass spectrometry. Ni(II), Zn(II) und Cu(II) ions formed complexes with 172, which mainly represent 1 : 2 -complexes, when the ligands and the metal ions were mixed in a ratio of 1 : 2. Interestingly, the high selectivity of 172 to Ni(II) ions can be explained by a more favourable binding motif. The same reason led to a stable binding between 173 and Fe(III) ion. The 1 : 2 complex consisting of 173 and Fe(III) ion was stabilized by one oxide anion (O 2 ‒) and two chloride ions (Cl‒). These experiments delivered important information, that not all N-atoms, which are located close to metal ion, were involved in the less favoured binding site, although the geometry would be suitable. In contrast, all adequate N-atoms participate in complex building in the favoured binding site. This depends on the character of the metal ions and causes different physical and chemical properties of the complexes...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{graphene}} oxide (GO) is highly stable in air or water. However, the stability of asymmetric graphene oxide (GO) membrane depends on the chemistry of the support and also the thickness of the targeted coated GO layer. It is found that the GO membranes prepared on porous Al 2 O 3 supports are unstable, and easy to crinkle and finally peel off from the support surface in a short time due to poor interaction with the support surface. In the present work, we have successfully prepared highly stable, permselective and reproducible GO membranes for seawater desalination by using polydopamine (PDA) as <b>a</b> novel <b>covalent</b> <b>linker.</b> Attributing to the high adhesive ability of PDA, GO nanosheets are attracted and bound onto the support surface, thus remarkably enhancing the stability of the GO membranes. It is found that the developed GO membranes are very promising for seawater desalination. For desalination of 3. 5 wt% seawater at 90 C, high water fluxes of 48. 4 kg m(- 2) h(- 1) and high ion rejections of over 99. 7 % can be obtained for the GO membrane which are much higher than those obtained from conventional porous inorganic membranes.

This approach employs an automated ultra-­microtome fitted into a scanning electron microscope that images the specimensurface, or block-­face, following each iterative nanometer thin cut. However, aprincipal limitation {{of this approach is}} the resolution obtainable using backscatterelectrons at low accelerating voltages due to the build up of electrostatic chargeson the block-­face, otherwise known as “charging. ” Herein, we present a specimenpreparation protocol that implements heavy metal staining, and a series ofmethods for use of conductive materials, as either <b>a</b> dopant, <b>covalent</b> <b>linker,</b> ormetal coordinated matrix (scaffold), in the epoxy resin.

40|$|Covalently interstrand {{cross-linked}} DNA is {{an interesting}} tool to study DNA binding proteins that locally open up the DNA duplex by flipping single bases out of the DNA helix or melting whole stretches of base pairs to perform their function. The ideal DNA cross-link to study protein–DNA interactions should be specific and easy to synthesize, be stable during protein binding experiments, have <b>a</b> short <b>covalent</b> <b>linker</b> to avoid steric hindrance of protein binding, and should be available as a mimic for both A/T and G/C base pairs to cover all possible binding specificities. Several covalent interstrand cross-links have been described in the literature, {{but most of them}} fall short of {{at least one of the}} above criteria. We developed an efficient method to site-specifically and reversibly cross-link thionucleoside base pairs in synthetic duplex oligodeoxynucleotides by bisalkylation with 1, 2 -diiodoethane resulting in an ethylene-bridged base pair. Both linked A/T and G/C base pair analogs can conveniently be prepared which allows studying any base pair-opening enzyme regardless of its sequence specificity. The cross-link is stable in the absence of reducing agents but the linker can be quickly and tracelessly removed by the addition of thiol reagents like dithiothreitol. This property makes the cross-linking reaction fully reversible and allows for a switching of the linked base pair from locked to unlocked during biochemical experiments. Using the DNA methyltransferase from Thermus aquaticus (M. TaqI) as example, we demonstrate that the presented cross-linked DNA with an ethylene-linked A/T base pair analog at the target position is a useful tool to determine the base-flipping equilibrium constant of a base-flipping enzyme which lies mostly on the extrahelical side for M.

The dimer was crystallized in the cubic F 432 space group.

The octahedral particles are probably artifacts created by the particular crystal packing. When it is not crystallized in the F cubic crystal form, the coat protein dimer appears to assemble into T = 3 icosahedral particles indistinguishable from the wild-type particles. To form an octahedral particle with closed surface, the dimer subunits interact at sharper angles than in the icosahedral arrangement. The fold of the covalent dimer is almost identical to the wild-type dimer with differences located in loops and in the <b>covalent</b> <b>linker</b> region.

40|$|Modern polymer {{research}} is uncovering new materials for biomedical applications. This thesis centers on novel polymer syntheses towards anti-cancer therapeutics termed polymer “pro-drugs”. In particular, aliphatic polyesters are potentially useful for drug delivery {{due to their}} biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, conventional aliphatic polyesters lack functionality. Incorporating functionality into aliphatic polyesters carries the potential to tailor their properties, and provides a method to attach drugs covalently. There are significant challenges associated with aliphatic polyester functionalization due to side-reactions including degradation of the polymer backbone. To overcome this challenge, alkyne functionalized lactones were synthesized, and click cycloaddition chemistry was employed to covalently attach novel azides to these alkyne containing aliphatic polyesters. ^ A novel trimethylsilane protected alkyne d-valerolactone was synthesized and used {{in the preparation of}} block copolymers allowing for orthogonal functionalization strategies. Tin (II) mediated ring-opening polymerization of the lactones led to aliphatic polyesters with a narrow molecular weight distribution that had pendent alkynes available for post-polymerization chemistry. ^ Click cycloaddition chemistry afforded water-soluble aliphatic polyesters by attaching PEGylated and zwitterionic azides to the polymer backbone. Novel phosphorylcholine and phosphobetaine-azides were prepared and grafted to the polyester chain. ^ Camptothecin (CPT), an anti-cancer drug, was covalently attached to the aliphatic polyesters through <b>a</b> variety of <b>covalent</b> <b>linkers.</b> High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to examine the release of CPT from the pro-drugs. With some of the linkers, CPT was seen to release from the aliphatic polyester with half-lives of 2 – 4 hours in human plasma. Physicochemical characterization techniques, including light scattering and atomic force microscopy (AFM), were used to investigate the properties of the polymeric pro-drug micelles. These micelles were approximately 60 - 120 nm in hydrodynamic radius. In vitro assays with MCF 7 (breast cancer) and COLO 205 (colorectal cancer) cells were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the polymers pro-drugs. IC 50 values as low as 4 µM in COLO 205 cells indicated the release of CPT in its cytotoxic form, and the potential of these aliphatic polyesters to function as a drug delivery platform. ...|$|R
