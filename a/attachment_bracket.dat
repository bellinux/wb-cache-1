40|$|Four cracked cabin <b>attachment</b> <b>brackets</b> {{belonging}} to {{a particular type of}} helicopters were sent to the laboratory for analyzing the cause of failure. Examination revealed that in all the cases, fatigue crack had initiated at the weld toe and propagated progressively across the weld and then in the parent metal of the bracket. Analysis showed that the rigidity introduced in the structure due to design modification was responsible for the early fatigue crack initiation. It is recommended that the design modification be discontinued and the original design be restored to prevent recurrence of such failures. With original design in place, the premature cracking can take place if there are assembly stresses and/or weld defects. It is, therefore, necessary to address these issues rather than attempting design modification such as the present one, which does not appear permissible considering the design philosophy of the cabin <b>attachment</b> <b>brackets...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to reevaluate and improve the existing cable-to-post attachment hardware that is utilized in the non-proprietary cable barrier being developed at MwRSF. The study focused on redesigning the bolted, tabbed bracket (V 10) to eliminate the bolt, reduce the number of components per bracket, eliminate the need for tools during installation, and reduce the number of small parts. Three attachment concepts were selected for evaluation through dynamic testing: (1) the key plate attachment; (2) the wire lock pin attachment; and (3) the pinned back attachment. Each attachment prototype was subjected to two vertical and two lateral dynamic component tests to evaluate the release loads and fracture mechanisms of the brackets. Test results were compared to previous tests on the bolted tabbed bracket (V 10). None of the three <b>bracket</b> <b>attachment</b> designs were found to satisfy all of the design criteria for an alternative bracket. The lack of fixity in the connection between the brackets and the post led to a variable position of the tabs within the keyway which frequently caused unsatisfactory release loads.

40|$|Civil {{transport}} aircraft {{is used for}} ferrying passengers {{from one place to}} another. Aircraft is a highly complex flying structure. Generally {{transport aircraft}} undergoes nominal maneuring flights. During the flight when the maximum lift is generated, the wings of the aircraft will undergo highest bending moment. The bending moment will be maximum {{at the root of the}} wing which caused highest stress at this location. Wings are attached to the fuselage structure through wing-fuselage attachment brackets. The bending moment and shear loads from the wing are transferred to the fuselage through the attachment joints. In this project bending load transfer joint is considered for the analysis.

5000|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} {{from a pair}} of duralumin monocoques, bolted together. Each was constructed using Shorts' established method of plate riveted to oval, L-section frames and with longitudinal stiffeners. [...] The Sturgeon was powered by an uncowled Bristol Jupiter VI radial engine, driving a two-bladed propeller and with exhausts leading back over the lower wing. There were three open cockpits, one behind the other. The pilot sat in front, behind the leading edge with the navigator cum bomb-aimer close behind him. The latter's position was just at the wing cut-out; he also had a bombsight hatch in the floor. A little further back was the radio operator/rear gunner, clear of the trailing edge. The fuselage diameter decreased to the tail, where a squat fin carried a tall, horn balanced rudder which extended {{down to the bottom of}} the fuselage. The tailplane was strut supported from below and sat on the fin just above the fuselage; it was straight edged and carried unbalanced, split elevators. One problem in adapting the monocoque method to a service aircraft was that the numerous openings and <b>attachment</b> <b>brackets</b> all needed local reinforcement, leading to a considerable weight gain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Multiple mission reuse {{capability}} {{has become}} extremely important, towards reducing costs of space transportation. Carbon / Carbon (C/C) composites are well proven, functionally, for repeated use in re-entry missions. A re-entry capsule with sphere-cone-flare external shape, currently under realisation, will fly with C/C Thermal Protection System (TPS) in its peak heating region. The biggest challenge in design {{of such a}} reusable hot structure TPS is the management of thermo-structural loads. Differential Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) is {{the main cause of}} stress on the structural assembly elements. A set of flexible super alloy <b>attachment</b> <b>brackets</b> have been configured {{to take care of this}} differential thermal expansion of various TPS elements. The brackets also have to survive the impact transient load, on splashdown. This load was estimated using explicit non linear Finite Element method by considering the whole structure a rigid body.

In order to demonstrate the margins and survivability of the assembly, as a whole, a water impact test with actual qualification model of the assembly was carried out in a 10 m deep shock tank.

40|$|Abstract — Fighter {{aircraft}} is {{a highly}} complex structure. The aircraft needs to execute complicated maneuvers while fighting with enemies. Complicated maneuvers will require instant change in acceleration. The combination of high level of acceleration and complicated maneuvers will introduce high magnitude of loads on the wings. Normally the fighter aircraft will have wing-fuselage attachments at more than one location. Rarely an aircraft will fail due to a static overload during its service life. For the continued airworthiness of an aircraft during its entire economic service life, fatigue and damage tolerance design, analysis, testing and service experience correlation play a pivotal role. In the current project, an attempt {{will be made to}} predict the fatigue life of wing-fuselage <b>attachment</b> <b>bracket</b> in a fighter airframe.

40|$|Tendon and {{ligament}} damage causes extreme {{pain and}} decreased joint functionality. Current repair methods cannot restore original joint biomechanics nor promote regeneration of native tissue. Recent advances in tendon and ligament repair have involved engineering tissue using cell-seeded scaffolds. Self-aligned cellular structures, {{similar to those}} in ligaments and tendons, have been successfully formed, albeit with weak attachment between construct and bone. Calcium phosphates form an intimate bond with both soft and hard tissues and have successfully been used in tissue engineering bone, whilst hydrogels have often been used as cellular scaffolds. This thesis explores agarose, gelatin, carrageenan and fibrin hydrogels as potential soft tissue scaffolds. Fibrin gel exhibited high cellular compatibility with highest metabolic activity on day 14. Although the cellular gel contracted significantly, {{it was found that the}} dry weight remained stable in both the acellular and cellular forms. 3 D powder printed calcium phosphate scaffolds remained structurally stable after immersion in cell culture media with immersion in protein-rich sera promoting tenocyte <b>attachment.</b> <b>Bracket</b> designs were developed to enhance grip of the cell-seeded fibrin. Ligament constructs were selfsupporting and exhibited structural characteristics similar to native connective tissue. Tenocyte density peaked on day 14, with added L-proline and ascorbic acid inducing a constant level of glycosaminoglycans and 7. 4 ± 1. 5 % w/w collagen.

40|$|Background: Orthodontic {{treatment}} involves using {{fixed or}} removable appliances (dental braces) {{to correct the}} positions of teeth. It {{has been shown that}} the quality of treatment result obtained with fixed appliances is much better than with removable appliances. Fixed appliances are, therefore, favoured by most orthodontists for treatment. The success of a fixed orthodontic appliance depends on the metal <b>attachments</b> (<b>brackets</b> and bands) being attached securely to the teeth so that they do not become loose during treatment. Brackets are usually attached to the front and side teeth, whereas bands (metal rings that go round the teeth) are more commonly used on the back teeth (molars). A number of adhesives are available to attach bands to teeth and {{it is important to understand}} which group of adhesives bond most reliably, as well as reducing or preventing dental decay during the treatment period. :Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of the adhesives used to attach bands to teeth during fixed appliance treatment, in terms of: (1) how often the bands come off during treatment; and (2) whether they protect the banded teeth against decay during fixed appliance treatment. Search methods: The following electronic databases were searched: Cochrane Oral Health 2 ̆ 7 s Trials Register (searched 2 June 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 5) in the Cochrane Library (searched 2 June 2016), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 2 June 2016) and EMBASE Ovid (1980 to 2 June 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials. gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria: Randomised and controlled clinical trials (RCTs and CCTs) (including split-mouth studies) of adhesives used to attach orthodontic bands to molar teeth were selected. Patients with full arch fixed orthodontic appliance(s) who had bands attached to molars were included. Data collection and analysis: All review authors were involved in study selection, validity assessment and data extraction without blinding to the authors, adhesives used or results obtained. All disagreements were resolved by discussion. Main results: Five RCTs and three CCTs were identified as meeting the review 2 ̆ 7 s inclusion criteria. All the included trials were of split-mouth design. Four trials compared chemically cured zinc phosphate and chemically cured glass ionomer; three trials compared chemically cured glass ionomer cement with light cured compomer; one trial compared chemically cured glass ionomer with a chemically cured glass phosphonate.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the bonding strength of orthodontic brackets to laser-etched surfaces of bleached teeth. Methods: In a nonbleached control group, acid etching (group A) or Er:YAG laser application (group B) was performed prior to bracket bonding (n = 13 in each group). Similar surface treatments were performed at 1 day (groups C and D; n = 13 in each subgroup) or at 3 weeks (groups E and F; n = 13 in each subgroup) after 38 % hydrogen peroxide bleaching in another set of teeth. The specimens were debonded after thermocycling. Results: Laser etching of bleached teeth resulted in clinically unacceptable low bonding strength. In the case of acid-etched teeth, waiting for 3 weeks before <b>attachment</b> of <b>brackets</b> to the bleached surfaces resulted in similar, but not identical, bond strength values as those obtained with nonbleached surfaces.

30|$|Angle {{introduced}} the edgewise {{system based on}} a 3 -dimensional tooth control obtained by engaging a rectangular wire into a bracket with a rectangular slot [1]. Andrews, {{taking advantage of the}} control offered by the edgewise system, advocated the use of the straight wire appliance (SWA) [2]. The mainstay of the SWA is the omission of tedious archwire bending by using tooth-specific brackets incorporating key attributes governing the final tooth position [3],[4]. Considering that SWA brackets contain the necessary information for the desired tooth position (i.e., tip, torque, height, and rotation) [5], the only variables are tooth morphology and the position of the bracket {{on the surface of the}} tooth. While acknowledging the numerous benefits of the SWA, years of clinical practice and experience have shown that the need for archwire bending is yet to be completely eliminated [6],[7]. Errors in bracket placement will lead to discrepancies in the final tooth positions [8]. Vertical bracket positioning and its effect on torque and incisor inclination have been the subject of several studies [9]–[12]. As much as 10 ° variation in torque has been observed when bracket placement differed by 1  mm [12]. Even if <b>bracket</b> <b>attachment</b> is performed perfectly, the variation in tooth morphology would render any prescription insufficient in obtaining ideal tooth positions [8].|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) Introduction: Micro-leakage and enamel {{demineralization}} {{is still}} a major challenge in dental practice. It can lead to formation of demineralization lesions around and beneath the adhesive–enamel interface (Mali et al., 2006). Enamel demineralization adjacent to orthodontic brackets {{is one of the}} risks associated with orthodontic treatment. The prevention of demineralization during orthodontic treatment is therefore essential for aesthetic reasons and to circumvent the onset of caries. Aim: To assess micro-leakage and enamel demineralization around orthodontic direct <b>attachments</b> (<b>brackets)</b> using three different orthodontic cements. Materials and methods: In this in-vitro study, intact (non carious) extracted human premolars were used to compare the micro-leakage and enamel demineralization of three different cements (Fuji Ortho LC, Rely X luting 2 and Transbond XT). The dye penetration technique was used to evaluate micro-leakage on extracted human premolars. Micro-hardness testing was performed on 21 teeth to determine enamel demineralization. Sixty teeth were randomly divided into 3 groups of twenty teeth each. Direct attachments were cemented on each tooth using 3 different cements; Fuji Ortho LC (GC Fuji II LC GC Corporation Tokyo, Japan), (group 1), Rely X luting 2 cement (3 M ESPE dental product, USA), (group 2), Transbond XT Light Cure (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif), (group 3). After the orthodontic direct attachments were fitted, they were exposed to 500 thermo-cycles between 5 °C and 55 °C, with a dwell time of 15 seconds in a buffered (pH 7) 1 % methylene blue dye solution (Grobler et al, 2007). The specimens were viewed under a stereomicroscope (Nikon, Japan) at magnification of 40 times. Photographs of each specimen were taken with a Leica camera (Leica DFC 290 micro-systems, Germany) fitted onto a stereomicroscope. The ACDsee photo editing programme was used to transfer the photographs to a computer to measure the dye penetration along the enamel–adhesive and adhesive–bracket interfaces, both on the gingival and occlusal edge at × 40 magnification. For the demineralization sample, 21 teeth were divided into 3 groups of seven teeth each, where direct attachments were cemented using each of the 3 cements, group 1, Fuji Ortho LC (GC Fuji II LC GC Corporation Tokyo, Japan); group 2, Rely X luting 2 cement (3 M ESPE dental product, USA) and group 3, Transbond XT Light Cure (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif). A digital hardness tester with Vickers diamond indenter (Zwick RoellIndentec (ZHV; Indentec UK) was used to measure surface micro-hardness of enamel before and after attaching the brackets. Ten indentations were made on the enamel surface of each tooth before bonding the brackets with a 300 g load applied for 15 seconds to establish the baseline hardness value. After de-bonding the brackets, the hardness was measured again in the same area as mentioned above to determine the degree of enamel demineralization (softening). Result: The result showed statistically significantly lower levels of micro-leakage for Transbond XT (P= < 0. 001). The amount of micro-leakage on the margins was significantly higher in the gingival portion (P < 0. 05) as compared with the occlusal margin. Enamel micro-hardness tests before bonding using the three different cements showed that the variances are not significantly different (Chi-squared = 3. 051, df = 2, p-value = 0. 218). However, the micro-hardness tests done after bonding and thermo-cycling was statistically significantly different (Chi-squared = 13. 435, df = 2, p-value = 0. 001). Clearly, the Transbond XT group had less hardness, implying greater demineralization than the Fuji Ortho LC and Rely X luting 2 groups. Two sample t-tests show that mean value for the Fuji Ortho and Rely X luting 2 were not significantly different from each other (t = - 0. 636, df = 12, p-value = 0. 537). The mean value for Transbond XT differed significantly from both the other two means: Transbond XT vs Fuji Ortho LC (t = 3. 249, df = 6. 9, p-value = 0. 014). Transbond XT vs Rely X luting 2 (t = 3. 493, df = 6. 8, p-value = 0. 011). Conclusions: This study showed that Fuji Ortho LC and Rely X luting 2 show more micro-leakage than Transbond XT. However Transbond XT had significant lower micro-leakage, less hardness (greater demineralization) than the Fuji Ortho LC and Rely X luting 2. This may have been due to the fluoride release which significantly reduces demineralization. Therefore the Fuji Ortho LC and Rely X luting 2 may be recommended for prevention of demineralization during orthodontic treatment...|$|R
