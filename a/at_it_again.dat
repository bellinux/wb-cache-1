500|$|The {{immediate}} {{responses to}} the publication included newspaper sellers refusing to distribute that day's paper. In the following days, the cartoons received significant attention in other Danish press outlets. According to Jytte Klausen, [...] "most people groaned that the newspaper was <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> bashing Muslims. The instinct was to split the blame." [...] Berlingske-Tidende criticised the 'gag', but also said that Islam should be openly criticised. Politiken attacked Rose's account of growing self-censorship; it also surveyed Danish cartoonists and said that self-censorship was not generally perceived as a problem. On October 4, a local teenager telephoned the newspaper offices threatening to kill the cartoonists, but he was arrested after his mother turned him in.|$|E

On the same day, the first stop of their U.S. [...] "Right Back At It Again" [...] tour, A Day to Remember played a new track scheduled to appear on Common Courtesy, titled [...] "Right Back at It Again". They have continued to play this new track on each stop of the Right Back <b>at</b> <b>It</b> <b>Again</b> tour.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Lamb did {{not like}} the changes {{incorporated}} in the 1796 edition of [...] "Monody" [...] and told Coleridge [...] "I rather wish you had left the monody on Chatterton concluding as it did abruptly. It had more of unity" [...] and, later, [...] "I am not quite satisfied with the Chatterton, and with your leave shall try my hand <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> A master joiner, you know, may leave a cabinet to be finished, when his own hands are full" [...] but Coleridge refused any of his suggestions.|$|E
2500|$|When she {{was shown}} the plaster cast bust {{of the dead}} man by Detective Sergeant Leane, Thomson said she could not {{identify}} the person depicted. According to Leane, he described her reaction upon seeing the cast as [...] "completely taken aback, {{to the point of}} giving the appearance that she was about to faint." [...] In an interview many years later, Paul Lawson – the technician who made the cast and was present when Thomson viewed it – noted that after looking at the bust she immediately looked away and would not look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

2500|$|.....a {{painting}} is done when the artist dies. Previously, I {{felt that a}} painting was done when I have taken {{it as far as}} I could, at that point in time, and signed it. Now, if the {{painting is}} still in my possession and I am not impressed with it, I may rework it. A painting is like a motion picture, always evolving. We hit pause when it looks good to us and then we sign it. But we may come back to it sometime later and look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> with a perspective enhanced by experience and development and say, “this painting needs more work.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry {{entered a}} Germany in turmoil. A staunch ally against Cuno in Bavaria, Gebhard of Regensburg, was implicated in a plot against the king along with Cuno and Welf of Carinthia. Sources diverge here: some claim {{only that the}} {{retainers}} of the princes plotted the undoing of the king. Whatever the case, it all came to naught, and Cuno died of plague, and Welf soon following him to the grave. Baldwin of Flanders and Godfrey were <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> besieging Antwerp, and they were defeated again. Henry's reign was clearly changing in character: old foes were dead or dying and old friends as well.|$|E
2500|$|Davidman {{was a child}} prodigy, {{who scored}} above 150 on IQ testing, with {{exceptional}} critical, analytical and musical skills. She read H. G. Wells's The Outline of History {{at the age of}} eight and was able to play a score of Chopin on the piano, after having read it once and not looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> At an early age, she read George MacDonald's children's books and his adult fantasy book, Phantastes. [...] She wrote about the influence of these stories: [...] "They developed in me a lifelong taste for fantasy, which led me years later to C. S. Lewis, who in turn led me to religion." [...] A sickly child, suffering from a crooked spine, scarlet fever and anemia throughout her school years, and attending classes with much older classmates, she later referred to herself at this time as being [...] "bookish, over-precocious and arrogant".|$|E

Dave Lee, who was bandleader on I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again, was at the piano and a number of rounds were introduced by a short phrase of music. Other rounds included [...] "Dialogue Read in a Specific Accent" [...] and [...] "Songs Sung as Animals". In 1974 Bill Oddie was replaced by Willie Rushton, with Barry Cryer as Graeme Garden's teammate, and Humphrey Lyttelton as chairman, and the personnel remained constant from this point until Rushton's death in 1996. Since then the fourth seat on the panel has featured a variety of guest comedians.|$|E
