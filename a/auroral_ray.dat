40|$|On two evenings in 1968, {{anomalous}} field-aligned brightenings or emission enhancements {{of up to}} 3 X {{were observed}} to move rapidly through three different Ba(+) clouds over Andoya, Norway. Similar effects were observed in Ba(+) clouds released from rockets launched from Poker Flat, Alaska, on March 21, 1973 and on March 22, 1980. On these occasions, auroras {{on or near the}} Ba(+) L shell also exhibited active rapid ray motions, which prompts the assumption that the two phenomena are related and the expectation that an explanation of the rapid ray motions in the Ba(+) clouds would lead {{to a better understanding of}} the physics of <b>auroral</b> <b>ray</b> motions and the auroral atmosphere. Seven possible mechanisms to produce the observed moving emission enhancements are discussed.

40|$|Videotapes of auroras {{from two}} space shuttle {{missions}} were analyzed {{to determine the}} locations of auroral rays. One hundred and forty <b>auroral</b> <b>ray</b> locations were determined by triangulating from pairs of images taken several seconds (20 - 100 km) apart. The rays, observed over a range of 18 hours in local magnetic time between 62 deg and 85 deg magnetic latitude, were mostly confined to the Feldstein oval {{in the evening and}} midnight sectors but were uniformly scattered well into the polar cap in the morning sector. Plots of ray border altitude versus magnetic time show a steady increase in lower border altitude, suggesting a decrease in energy from near 10 keV in the early evening to near 2 keV by midmorning. This variation for the energy in discrete rayed arcs is opposite to previous reports for the average energy of auroral electrons and suggests that the acceleration mechanism within discrete arcs differs from that pertaining to the auroral oval in general. Comparison of upper and lower border altitudes suggests a nearly monoenergetic electron flux shortly before midnight and a more extended distribution at both earlier and later times. The apparently independent variation in maximum energy and energy spread is difficult to reconcile with models involving acceleration of auroral electrons by parallel electric fields. There was only a slight dependence of border altitudes on magnetic latitude within the auroral oval, while rays in the polar cap (northward B(sub z)) were significantly higher...|$|E
40|$|As a {{continuation}} of the CASCADES (the Changing Aurora: in Situ and Camera analysis of Electron precipitation Structures) sounding rocket campaign, a ground based study of auroral structures and motions will be conducted this coming winter from Poker Flat, AK. A major goal {{of this study is to}} examine the small-scale perpendicular motions of auroral features in the context of auroral poleward boundary activity associated with substorm breakup. The use of an all-sky camera and a narrow-field camera at Poker Flat will allow for a 2 -D image of the auroral structures. The narrow-field camera has a 12 X 16 degree field of view and allows for viewing of sub-kilometer scale structures at 100 km altitude, and the all-sky camera provides a large scale auroral context. Ground magnetometers at Poker Flat, Fort Yukon, and Kaktovik provide a view of the 2 -D equivalent horizontal current structures associated with the auroral intensification. The 30 MHz imaging radar located in Anchorage will be used to image the same area that is being observed with the narrow-field camera. The SuperDARN radar on Kodiak Island may also be used to view the larger scale auroral activity over AK. The AMISR that is currently being constructed at Poker Flat will give high time and space resolution information on the auroral plasma structures present. Some of the science questions to be addressed with this array of instruments are: How intense are small-scale structures when viewed with high resolution? Does <b>auroral</b> <b>ray</b> size correlate to the perpendicular ray speed? What differences are observed between the motions of adjacent light and dark auroral signatures, and what can this tell us about ionospheric electric fields and plasma density? Can large flow fields exist at very low altitudes on small scales due to ionospheric modification? We are interested in getting feedback from other experimenters and modelers in terms of the relevance of the questions we are trying to address with the camera data as well as with AMISR and its capabilities...|$|E

30|$|If the {{substorm}} onset {{is defined}} as the first signature, it is likely to correspond to AIB, which is the original definition of onsets.

The AIB may be a manifestation of the triggering process of substorms, such as near-earth instabilities or the initial stage of tail reconnection.

However, it may also be possible that the AIB is not directly associated with substorm onsets and occurs under background conditions favorable for the occurrence of substorm onsets.|$|R

Using a 48 -coefficient spherical {{harmonic}} {{expansion of}} the geomagnetic field for 1955. 0, {{the results of an}} analysis due to Finch and Leaton, it is shown that geomagnetic field lines appear to interlink the northern and southern auroral zones. Theoretical average auroral isochasms are also estimated using an integral invariant for particle motion along the lines of force and between the northern and southern hemispheres. Some conditions pertinent to simul-tancity and similarity of the aurora borealis and the aurora australis are discussed. Though the auroral zones northern and southern shift in latitude with time, in accord with the intensity of magnetic disturbances, the average auroral zone remains a useful parameter in polar studies. The geographical distribution of isochasms appears to be successfully calculated from the geomagnetic field alone and an integral invariant of particle motion. The intersections of particular geomagnetic field lines with the earth's surface in the northern and southern hemispheres, or conjugate points, are indicated. Introduction.

40|$|The {{formation}} of tall red rays in the ionosphere {{has been a}} longstanding unresolved problem of <b>auroral</b> physics.

This work examines ohmic heating by collisional processes in strong field-aligned current sheets to account for visible tall rays. The mechanism is demonstrated by two-dimensional simulation in a fully self-consistent treatment of the ionosphere and coupling to the magnetosphere. We find that a filamentary current density of about 600 µAm- 2 over about ten seconds can pump sufficient energy into the ambient oxygen atoms to produce visible <b>auroral</b> red <b>rays.</b> The ohmic heating leads to an electron temperature in excess of 10, 000 K in the upper F-region...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{link between}} natural ion-line {{enhancements}} in radar spectra and auroral activity {{has been the}} subject of recent studies but conclusions have been limited by the spatial and temporal resolution previously available. The next challenge is to use shorter sub-second integration times in combination with interferometric programmes to resolve spatial structure within the main radar beam, and so relate enhanced filaments to individual <b>auroral</b> <b>rays.</b> This paper presents initial studies of a technique, using optical and spectral satellite signatures, to calibrate the received phase of a signal with the position of the scattering source along the interferometric baseline of the EISCAT Svalbard Radar. It is shown that a consistent relationship can be found only if the satellite passage through the phase fringes is adjusted from the passage predicted by optical tracking. This required adjustment is interpreted as being due to the vector between the theoretical focusing points of the two antennae, i. e. the true radar baseline, differing from the baseline obtained by survey between the antenna foot points.

40|$|We {{present results}} of an {{investigation}} of the fine structure of the night sector diffuse auroral zone, observed simultaneously with optical instruments (ALIS) from the ground and the FAST electron spectrometer from space 16 February 1997. Both the optical and particle data show that the diffuse auroral zone consisted of two regions. The equatorward part of the diffuse aurora was occupied by a pattern of regular, parallel auroral stripes. The auroral stripes were significantly brighter than the background luminosity, had widths of approximately 5 km and moved southward with a velocity of about 100 m/s. The second region, located between the region with auroral stripes and the discrete auroral arcs to the north, was filled with weak and almost homogeneous luminosity, against which short-lived <b>auroral</b> <b>rays</b> and small patches appeared chaotically. From analysis of the electron differential fluxes corresponding to the different regions of the diffuse aurora and based on existing theories of the scattering process we conclude the following: Strong pitch angle diffusion by electron cyclotron harmonic waves (ECH) of plasma sheet electrons in the energy range from a few hundred eV to 3 – 4 keV was responsible for the electron precipitation, that produced the background luminosity within the whole diffuse zone. The fine structure, represented by the auroral stripes, was created by precipitation of electrons above 3 – 4 keV as a result of pitch angle diffusion into the loss cone by whistler mode waves. A so called "internal gravity wave" (Safargaleev and Maltsev, 1986) may explain the formation of the regular spatial pattern formed by the auroral stripes in the equatorward part of the diffuse auroral zone...|$|R

40|$|Observations of Jupiter {{carried out}} by the Chandra ACIS-S {{instrument}} over 24 - 26 February, 2003, show that the auroral X-ray spectrum consists of line emission consistent with high-charge states of precipitating ions, and not a continuum as might be expected from bremsstrahlung. The part of the spectrum due to oxygen peaks around 650 eV, which indicates a high fraction of fully-stripped oxygen in the precipitating ion flux. A combination of the OVIII emission lines at 653 eV and 774 eV, as well as the OVII emission lines at 561 eV and 666 eV, are evident in the measure auroral spectrum. There is also line emission at lower energies in the spectral region extending from 250 to 350 eV, which could be from sulfur and/or carbon. The Jovian <b>auroral</b> X- <b>ray</b> spectra are significantly different from the X-ray spectra of comets. The charge state distribution of the oxygen ions implied by the measured auroral X-ray spectra strongly suggests that, independent of the source of the energetic ions - magnetospheric or solar wind - the ions have undergone additional acceleration. This spectral evidence for ion acceleration is also consistent with the relatively high intensities of the X-rays compared to the available phase space density of the (unaccelerated) source populations of solar wind or magnetospheric ions at Jupiter, which are orders of magnitude too small to explain the observed emissions. The Chandra X-ray observations were executed simultaneously with observations at ultraviolet wavelengths by the Hubble Space Telescope and at radio wavelengths by the Ulysses spacecraft. These additional data sets suggest that the source of the X-rays is magnetospheric in origin, and that the precipitating particles are accelerated by strong field-aligned electric fields, which simultaneously create both the several-MeV energetic ion population and the relativistic electrons observed in situ by Ulysses that are correlated with approximately 40 minute quasi-periodic radio outbursts...|$|R

A superposed epoch analysis shows a systematic difference in the structure between the upward and downward field-aligned currents, confirming that the abrupt variations are due to spatial structure of small-scale field-aligned current sheets. The estimated current density is very high (> 90 μA/m^ 2). The high density downward currents are canceled by adjacent strong upward currents, and the net current is upward or almost zero. On the other hand, a high density upward current does not necessarily accompany adjacent strong downward current, and the net current around the region is upward. The thickness of the current sheet is normally 0. 5 - 1. 0 km or less, suggesting that the events {{are related to the}} <b>rayed</b> <b>auroral</b> arc elements.

40|$|We {{report the}} first Jupiter Xâ ray {{observations}} planned {{to coincide with}} an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). At the predicted ICME arrival time, we observed a factor of â ¼ 8 enhancement in Jupiter’s Xâ ray aurora. Within 1. 5 Â h of this enhancement, intense bursts of nonâ Io decametric radio emission occurred. Spatial, spectral, and temporal characteristics also varied between ICME arrival and another Xâ ray observation two days later. Gladstone et al. (2002) discovered the polar Xâ ray hot spot and found it pulsed with 45 Â min quasiperiodicity. During the ICME arrival, the hot spot expanded and exhibited two periods: 26 Â min periodicity from sulfur ions and 12 Â min periodicity from a mixture of carbon/sulfur and oxygen ions. After the ICME, the dominant period became 42 Â min. By comparing Vogt et al. (2011) Jovian mapping models with spectral analysis, we found that during ICME arrival at least two distinct ion populations, from Jupiter’s dayside, produced the Xâ ray aurora. Auroras mapping to magnetospheric field lines between 50 and 70 Â RJ were dominated by emission from precipitating sulfur ions (S 7 +,â ¦, 14 +). Emissions mapping to closed field lines between 70 and 120 Â RJ and to open field lines were generated by a mixture of precipitating oxygen (O 7 +, 8 +) and sulfur/carbon ions, possibly implying some solar wind precipitation. We suggest that the best explanation for the Xâ ray hot spot is pulsed dayside reconnection perturbing magnetospheric downward currents, as proposed by Bunce et al. (2004). The auroral enhancement has different spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics to the hot spot. By analyzing these characteristics and coincident radio emissions, we propose that the enhancement is driven directly by the ICME through Jovian magnetosphere compression and/or a largeâ scale dayside reconnection event.

40|$|Optical {{measurements}} of small-scale auroral structures are here combined with spectrographic data {{in order to}} study the relationship between auroral morphology and the energy characteristics of the precipitating population. It is shown that <b>rayed</b> <b>auroral</b> structures are associated with precipitating electrons with a broad range in energy, including a significant population at energies of around 100 eV. In comparison, observations of fast-moving auroral arc elements are shown to result from precipitation energy distributions peaking at several keV with a very small low-energy component. This spectrographic information feeds directly into the study of naturally enhanced ion-acoustic lines, or NEIALs, which have been observed by incoherent-scatter radars at high-latitudes. It has been proposed that these radar enhancements result from natural plasma instability, causing the generation of ion-acoustic waves through the decay of unstable Langmuir waves, themselves driven by low-energy electron streams. Using multi-spectral imaging in combination with radar observations, a direct link is shown between ion-acoustic wave enhancements and precipitating electrons at 100 eV energies. Wave enhancements at the radar wavevector which are three orders of magnitude above the thermal level, are successfully modelled using the Langmuir decay interpretation for the time of observation. Electron populations with a broad energy range are thought to result from Alfv´enic acceleration mechanisms, which {{play an important role}} in the generation of smallscale auroral structure. With the recent advancements in multi-spectral imaging, it is now possible to resolve auroral filaments of a few hundred meters width. An interferometric imaging capability is under development for the EISCAT Svalbard Radar system, in order to resolve scattering wave structures on similar spatial scales within the radar beam. A technique is demonstrated by which to calibrate the position of coherent echoes detected by the interferometer.

The exploration of auroras in Russia from Lomonosov in the 18 th century (Fig. 1) until {{the start of the}} International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957 is shortly summed up. A generalised pattern of discrete auroral forms along the auroral oval during geomagnetically very quiet intervals is presented in Fig. 5. The changes of discrete auroral forms versus local time exhibit a fixed pattern with respect to the sun. The <b>auroral</b> forms comprise <b>rays</b> near noon, homogeneous arcs during the evening, and rayed arcs and bands during the night and in the morning. This fixed auroral pattern is unsettled during disturbances, which occur sometimes even during very quiet intervals. The azimuths of extended auroral forms vary with local time. Such variations in the orientation of extended forms above stations in the auroral zone have been used by various investigators to determine the position of the auroral oval (Fig. 9). Auroral luminosity of the daytime and nighttime sectors differ owing to different luminosity forms, directions of motion of the discrete forms, the height of the luminescent layers, and the spectral composition (predominant red emissions during daytime and green emissions during the night). Schemes that summarise principal peculiarities of daytime luminosity, its structure in MLT (magnetic local time) and MLat (magnetic latitude) coordinates, and the spectral composition of the luminosity {{are presented in}} Figs. 15 and 19. We discuss in detail the daytime sector dynamics of individual discrete forms for both quiet conditions and auroral substorms. The most important auroral changes during substorms occur in the nighttime sector. We present the evolution of conceptions about the succession of discrete auroral forms and their dynamics during disturbance intervals. This ranges from Birkeland's polar elementary storms, over the prospect of a fixed auroral pattern up to the auroral substorm model. The classic schemes of the spatial distribution and motion of discrete auroral forms during single substorms are shown in Fig. 20 (expansive and recovery phases) and Fig. 21 (creation, expansive and recovery phases). In this review we discuss various models of bulge formation, in particular as a result of new formation of arcs about 50 – 100 km poleward of previously existing auroral structures (Fig. 24). Discrete steps in the development of an expanding bulge are separated by 1 – 3 min from each other. The model of successive activations confines only to a ~ 40 ° longitudinal portion of the magnetotail (Fig. 28). We consider differences in the development of single substorms and substorms during magnetic storms. The structure and dynamics of auroras during steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) periods are dealt with in Sect. 8. A generalised scheme of the auroral distribution during SMC periods is shown in Fig. 34. Separate sections describe discrete auroras in the polar cap (Sect. 5), and the diffuse luminosity equatorward of the auroral oval (Sect. 9). Visual observations of diffuse auroral forms at midlatitudes suggest that the whole latitudinal interval between the auroral oval and the stable auroral red (SAR) arc is filled up with diffuse luminosity. SAR arcs with intensities of several tens of Rayleigh enclose systematically the region of diffuse luminosity; they are positioned at the border of the plasmasphere...|$|R
