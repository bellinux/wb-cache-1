Nevertheless, the European Commission has almost all avenues of investigation at its disposal, which it may use to investigate and track down violations of competition law. The European Commission may decide to start a sector inquiry when a market {{does not seem to be}} working as well as it should. This might be suggested by evidence such as limited trade between Member States, lack of new entrants on the market, the rigidity of prices, or other circumstances suggest that competition may be restricted or distorted within the common market. In the course of the inquiry, the Commission may request that firms - undertakings or <b>associations</b> <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> - concerned supply information (for example, price information).

40|$|In their {{economic}} activity, undertakings conclude many agreements between them. But {{agreements between undertakings}} which can distort the competition -anticompetitive agreements- are prohibited. The Romanian and EU law prohibit &# 39;all agreements between undertakings, decisions by <b>associations</b> <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition&# 39;. However, the terms &# 39;agreements&# 39;, &# 39;decisions&# 39; or &# 39;concerted practices&# 39; are nowhere defined in the EU Treaties or in the Romanian law. These terms are key concepts {{in the analysis of}} anticompetitive agreements which can distort the competition. In the lack of a legal definition, these concepts have generated a complex body of jurisprudence, which has to be identified. The analysis of these key concepts necessarily entails the conceptual delimitation of the notions. On this purpose, the relevant legal provisions will be identified in the Romanian and EU law, as well as the decisions of the European Court of Justice in this matter. The present paper intends to present the conceptual evolution of the analysed notions, paying special attention to concerted practices and to parallel behaviour in price fixing on the market...|$|E

The modified M. Porter's “Five Forces” model is used as the methodological base for the empirical analysis in Lithuania. The analysed period is 2000 - 2014 years. The analysis proved that the business <b>associations</b> and intension <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> to form the cartels are the main factors in the analysed country, which had positive impact on the emergence of the cartel. The producers of substitutes and potential competitors had no effect. The biggest influence on the breakdown of the cartel had the activity of Competition Council of the Republic of Lithuania...|$|R

40|$|The {{desire to}} {{maintain}} {{themselves on a}} particular market, {{at a higher level}} of profitability or at a reasonable level at least, can lead the undertakings to adopt an anticompetitive behaviour more easily. This may result from either the existence of anticompetitive agreements and concerted practices, or the tendency to abuse its dominant position which the undertaking has on a certain market. “The undertaking” and “the relevant market” are the key concepts in the analysis of anticompetitive practices. The active subject of anticompetitive practices is “the undertaking”. This concept has a particular significance in the competition law, different from the common law. Competition rules apply to the conduct of undertakings and <b>associations</b> <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> so that the concept of undertaking makes it possible to determine the categories of actors to which the competition rules apply. However, the term undertaking is nowhere defined in the EU Treaties; as such, the concept has generated a complex body of jurisprudence. "The market" is a term with pronounced economic resonances; synthetically, the market is the place where supply meets demand. In the context of the competition law, "the market" means "relevant market". The relevant market is the market of product/service in terms of demand and supply, and then superimposed on the geographic market. The analysis of these key concepts necessarily entails the conceptual delimitation of the notions. On this purpose, the relevant legal provisions will be identified in the Romanian and EU law, together with the decisions of the European Court of Justice in this matter...|$|E
30|$|In 2000, {{following}} the severe floods and storms of 1999, the two French insurance trade associations established the <b>Association</b> <b>of</b> French Insurance <b>Undertakings</b> for Natural Risk Knowledge and Reduction (Mission Risques Naturels—MRN). 4 Part of the MRN’s mission {{consists of the}} development of specific tools for professional purposes to assess flood risk. Vulnerability has been identified by many authors and insurers as the core concept in flood risk assessment (Birkmann and Wisner 2006). The AFA expects damages linked to vulnerability factors (number, value, and distribution of assets) to increase 72 % in the next 25  years, whereas the impact of climate change or annual climate variability is expected to play a smaller role (AFA 2015). Since its establishment, the MRN has supported Ph.D. research projects in collaboration with universities. This article is the result of one such project, initiated in 2014 between MRN and the urban planning laboratory Lab’urba, to develop an operational tool in order to integrate prevention into vulnerability assessment, as well as to improve prevention effectiveness knowledge in order to contribute to public policies.|$|R

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the social implications <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> is a topic that has made its way in the European law with quite enough difficulty, but became in time an increasingly discussed topic. Since the {{transfer of an undertaking}} from an employer to another could not be achieved with disregard of its human capital, the European legislator has established a legal framework ensuring the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings.</b> Currently, the main legal basis in the field consists of Council Directive 2001 / 23 /EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings,</b> businesses or parts <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> or businesses - the Transfer Directive.
