25|$|This land snail, {{which was}} {{described}} in 2007, lives in limestone areas in Vietnam. The species was described from just one shell, and thus no details of the anatomy of the soft parts or the radula could be provided. The shell is decollate (which means {{that several of the}} earlier whorls have been shed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> sealed off anew) making the spire blunt-ended.|$|E

While a doctoral candidate in 1953, Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> therefore has a personal connection {{with the thought of}} Saint Augustine.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the failure}} of the Gallipoli Campaign, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shell</b> Shortage to which it contributed, led to Conservative ministers joining the new Coalition Government, which boosted Wilson’s prospects.

Wilson’s personal relations with Asquith and Kitchener also appear to have become more cordial around this time. From July 1915 Asquith and Kitchener began to consult him regularly.|$|E

25|$|Originally, {{the skin}} was {{attached}} by wooden pegs that were driven through holes in the skin <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> near the playing edge. Four to five people would stretch the wet skin over the drum to apply tension while the pegs were driven into the bowl. The shrinkage of the skin while it dried then applied sufficient additional tension for the skin to resonate. A similar mounting technique is still used by the Landouma (a subgroup of the Baga people) for a djembe-like drum known as a gumbe. This mounting technique most likely goes back hundreds of years; the exact period is unknown.|$|E

A sixth upgrader, under construction in 2015 near Redwater, Alberta, will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel, with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants.|$|E

25|$|The {{round bow}} of Murtaja was modeled after Eisbrecher I, a German {{icebreaker}} designed by engineer Ferdinand Steinhaus from Hamburg and built in 1871, even though Robert Runeberg, an experienced Finnish naval architect {{and son of}} the national poet of Finland, had recommended a sharper ice-cutting bow instead of the spoon-shaped one. The angle of the stem, {{the first part of}} the icebreaker to encounter ice and bend it under the weight of the ship, was 33 degrees. The hull was extremely strong for its size <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> plating thickness at the ice belt, , was twice as thick as in the strongest winter ships at that time.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene can be {{converted}} to vinyl chloride by direct chlorination and subsequent thermal cracking. The first large scale production units for this route were constructed by Dow Chemical Co., Monsanto Chemical Co. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shell</b> Oil Co. The complete changeover to the exclusive use of ethylene as a feedstock became possible when the large-scale oxychlorination of ethylene to 1,2-dichloroethane had been proven to be technically feasible by Dow Chemical in the period 1955 – 1958. Since then, most plants now are using integrated, balanced DC– EDC – Oxy – EDC –VCM processes and more than 90% of the vinyl chloride presently produced in the Western World is derived from ethylene.|$|E
25|$|In {{this species}} {{the color of}} the shell is very variable. The {{background}} color can be whitish to greenish yellow, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> often has darker coloured bands or spots. The ventral side of the shell frequently has two brown bands, and is whitish between the lowest band and the umbilicus. The shell has 4-4.5 whorls. The last whorl descends abruptly below the periphery of the shell. The apertural margin is white, and is reflected (turned back)in adult shells, in juveniles this is true only on the columellar side. The umbilicus is narrow and open in juveniles, only partly covered by the reflected columellar margin,; the umbilicus is however completely closed in adult shells.|$|E

25|$|The {{benefits}} of shell tempered pottery vessels to the Mississippian household {{were much more}} efficient utility containers for cooking, particularly the increasing amounts of maize being grown in the valley, and thus sustaining larger and healthier populations in evidence in the archeological record. Around 800 CE, shell tempered pottery spread widely and rapidly from the middle Mississippi River valley to {{become an integral part}} of the expanding Mississippian culture and its improved set of technologies for horticulture, hunting and crafting. The bow and arrow, improved corn domestication <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> tempered pottery wares were major technical advances which, along with widespread trade, contributed to the formation of the advanced chiefdom societies populating the Eastern United States. These interacting chiefdoms were observed by the earliest of European contacts during the mid-16th century.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, the Army {{began its}} {{withdrawal}} from Camp Edwards. Otis Air Force Base was also closed this year.

In 1978, the Air Force returned with the Perimeter Acquisition Vehicle Entry Phased Array Warning System, more popularly known as PAVE PAWS. This new facility was known as Cape Cod Air Force Station. In 1986, an artilleryman from the Connecticut Army National Guard overloaded a gun <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> overshot the target by over a mile, hitting U.S. Route 6.

If one refers to the story of Al-Bakri, an Andalusian historian and geographer of the eleventh century, it is the mihrab which would be done by Uqba Ibn Nafi, the founder of Kairouan, whereas Lucien Golvin shares the view that it is not an old mihrab but hardly a begun construction which may serve to support marble panels and either goes back to work of Ziadet Allah I (817-838) or to those of Abul Ibrahim around the years 862-863. Above the marble cladding, the mihrab niche is crowned with a half dome-shaped vault made of manchineel bentwood. Covered with a thick coating completely painted, the concavity of the arch is decorated with intertwined scrolls enveloping stylized five-lobed vine leaves, three-lobed florets and sharp clusters, all in yellow on midnight blue background.|$|E
