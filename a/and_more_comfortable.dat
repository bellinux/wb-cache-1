5|$|On February 29, 1960, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) {{began to}} test a new tie-less roadbed on Track 1, which had been {{installed}} since the previous Thursday. The experiment was intended to produce a smoother <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> ride for commuters, in addition to lessening the effect of moisture and erosion. It was planned that if the test succeeded, {{the rest of the}} tracks in the subway system would be retrofitted in such a manner. The set-up included two parallel strips of concrete that would serve as the roadbed. Between them, flat-bottomed steel troughs were installed, cushioned by rubber. Inside the troughs, there were rubber tie plates spaced apart with flaps that encase the rail bottom. The rails were kept in place by lug bolts that were anchored in concrete. The third rail was also mounted on concrete. This differed from the normal roadbeds, which consisted of stone, with wooden ties set into it. The ties, under damp conditions, would rot and the spikes would become loose, resulting in bumpy rides. This test replicated similar roadbeds in Toronto's subway system. In order to construct the new roadbed, Track 1 had to be closed. From May 6 to June 5, 1961, Track 4 was closed for the installation of the same roadbed as was tested on Track 1.|$|E

25|$|A classic sling is braided from non-elastic material. The {{traditional}} {{materials are}} flax, hemp or wool; {{those of the}} Balearic islanders {{were said to be}} made from a type of rush. Flax and hemp resist rotting, but wool is softer <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 2008, {{almost four}} years after the release of the first Logan, a facelifted version called the Dacia New Logan was announced. The new version {{features}} a more modern design and a more attractive <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> interior. This facelift was adopted on the station wagon in October the same year.|$|E
25|$|The F-50s were {{replaced}} by the larger <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> Fokker 100 in 1996, which fuelled expansion to Bintulu. The route to Zürich was suspended in September 1996 to enable Royal Brunei to commence daily services to London Heathrow. Some London flights were routed through Yangon and Abu Dhabi, instead of via Singapore and Dubai; however, Yangon proved uneconomical and was discontinued the following year.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} face averaging tests, {{women with}} averaged faces {{have been shown}} to be considered more attractive. This is possibly due to average features being <b>more</b> familiar <b>and,</b> therefore, <b>more</b> <b>comfortable.</b>|$|R
25|$|Ideally, the {{advancing}} rear hoof oversteps {{the spot where}} the previously advancing front hoof touched the ground. The more the rear hoof oversteps, the smoother <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> the walk becomes. Individual horses and different breeds vary in the smoothness of their walk. However, a rider will almost always feel some degree of gentle side-to-side motion in the horse's hips as each hind leg reaches forward.|$|E
25|$|The RMC was a coach {{version for}} Green Line routes. RMCs had {{modified}} suspension and interiors {{to allow a}} longer range <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> running, an electrically operated door instead of an open platform, and a semi-automatic gearbox with higher gear ratios. The RCL was a long version of the RMC with a larger engine and similar coach-style features. Seating was provided for 57 on RMCs and 65 on RCLs.|$|E
25|$|Transportation between Serbia and Greece is well {{developed}} due to Greece's attractiveness {{as a tourist}} destination to Serbian tourists who often find it less expensive <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> {{to travel to the}} Greek coast rather than to western European or north African destinations. From Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport in Serbia, Air Serbia operates year-round flights to Athens International Airport and Thessaloniki International Airport. Aegean Airlines operates a year-round line from Athens to Belgrade as well.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the penitentiary}} {{administration}} directorate in 2011, the women's prison is less crowded <b>and</b> therefore <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> than the men's. On the other hand, male guards participated in monitoring female inmates, who risked becoming {{victims of sexual}} violence.|$|R
25|$|Officers' camps accommodated, in {{addition}} to their officer-prisoners, a smaller number of other ranks prisoners known as orderlies, whose role was to act as servants to the officers and to perform menial tasks around the camp. Orderlies appreciated that their situation was safer <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> than that of their counterparts in soldiers' camps, and so, even when offered the opportunity, they generally did not try to escape, knowing that if recaptured they would be sent to far worse conditions.|$|E
25|$|Since {{entering}} the tractor business in 1918, John Deere had focused on two-cylinder machines. The New Generation of Power introduced at Deere Day in Dallas {{was very different}} from anything Deere had built before. The new line of four- and six-cylinder tractors, the models 1010, 2010, 3010, and 4010, were more far more powerful than Deere's two-cylinder models, and also easier <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> to operate, with conveniently located controls, better visibility, and improved seat suspension. These new tractors were also easier to service.|$|E
25|$|Lviv {{used to have}} a Railbus; since {{replaced}} with other means of public transport. It was a motor-rail car that ran from the largest district of Lviv to one of the largest industrial zones going through the central railway station. It made 7 trips a day and was meant to provide a faster <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> connection between the remote urban districts. The price in February 2010 of a one-way single ride in the rail bus was 1.50 UAH. On 15 June 2010, the route was cancelled as unprofitable.|$|E

25|$|Real-time MRI {{refers to}} the {{continuous}} monitoring ("filming") of moving objects in real time. While many different strategies have been developed since the early 2000s, a recent development reported a real-time MRI technique based on radial FLASH and iterative reconstruction that yields a temporal resolution of 20 to 30 milliseconds for images with an in-plane resolution of 1.5 to 2.0mm. The new method promises to add important information about diseases of the joints and the heart. In many cases MRI examinations may become easier <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> for patients.|$|E
25|$|At present, most {{trousers}} {{are held}} {{up through the}} assistance of a belt which is passed through the belt loops on the waistband of the trousers. However, this was traditionally a style acceptable only for casual trousers and work trousers; suit trousers and formal trousers were suspended by the use of braces (suspenders in American English) attached to buttons located on the interior or exterior of the waistband. Today, this remains the preferred method of trouser support amongst adherents of classical British tailoring. Many men claim this method is more effective <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> because it requires no cinching of the waist or periodic adjustment.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, the Gatti family {{sold their}} {{interest}} in the theatre to Sir Peter Saunders, and in 1970 he commissioned Peter Rice to redesign the interior. Among other changes were a deep red wallpaper in the auditorium <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> seats. Also, the loggia above the street was glazed to make the balcony {{an extension of the}} bar. The backstage lighting was rerigged, and a forestage lift and counterweight flying system were installed. The theatre achieved some protection in 1972 when it was Grade II listed. In 1983, ownership passed to Michael Codron and David Sutton. Stephen Waley-Cohen took ownership in 1996, passing it to Max Weitzenhofer in 2002.|$|E

50|$|In 1937 {{a summer}} uniform was introduced. It was very {{different}} from the traditional navy blue tunic and black stockings, <b>and</b> much <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> to wear in the warmer months. It was a beige-coloured tunic.

25|$|Thus, {{the design}} {{appears as a}} {{comfortable}} dwelling complete with loggia and conservatory. A lesser architect {{might not have been}} able to resist the addition of a small turret or pinnacle. Petre's ingenuity lay in knowing how to mix large windows <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> features with the medieval, and then ascertaining the exact moment to halt the Gothic theme before it became a pastiche of the original. In this way Petre was referring in a modest way to the original Gothic revival period as conceived by such architects as James Wyatt, rather than the later Gothic, after it had fallen under the ecclesiastical Anglo-Catholic influences of such architects as Augustus Pugin in England, and Benjamin Mountfort in New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|A {{room on the}} {{northeast}} corner of {{the third floor of the}} Arsenal was made into a courtroom, and the prisoners were brought into the room through a side door, which prevented them from passing by or being harassed by spectators. Surratt was given special considerations during the trial because of her illness and gender. In the courtroom, she sat apart from the other prisoners. Sources differ as to whether an armed guard sat on either side of her, like for other prisoners during the trial. While the others wore wrist and ankle manacles in the courtroom, she did not. She was also permitted a bonnet, fan, and veil to hide her face from spectators. As her illness worsened during the trial, she was moved to a larger <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> prison cell.|$|E
25|$|The Dual Contracts {{resulted}} in the expansion of New York City; people moved to the newly built homes along the newly built subway lines. These homes were affordable, about the same cost as the houses in Brooklyn and Manhattan. The Dual Contracts were the key to dispersion of the city’s congested areas. They helped lower high population areas and probably helped saves lives as people were no longer living in heavily diseased areas. The population in Manhattan below 59th Street decreased between the years of 1910 and 1920. People were allowed to move to better parts the same cost and could have a better <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> life in the suburbs. They could still commute {{to work every day}} as most of the better off city workers who moved to the outer boroughs did.|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of the one-side ureterocutaneostomy and t he other-side ureterosigmoidostomy at total cystectomy is safer than the bilateral ureterosigmoidostomy, <b>and</b> is <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> than the bilateral ureterocutaneostomy {{due to the fact}} that the pore is single but worse because the blood chemical unbalances are more often...|$|R
