50|$|Each brigade was a mixed brigade {{consisting}} of four battalions, sometimes with an <b>ancillary</b> specialist support <b>company.</b> They had a brigade commander {{and a political}} commissar, and a small brigade staff. Initially, the battalions were formed entirely of foreign volunteers but, increasingly, it became practice {{to have at least}} one Spanish battalion in each brigade (and, from spring 1937, one Spanish company in each battalion). As time went on, and the difficulties of recruiting new international volunteers increased, the percentage of Spaniards went up. At first, these were volunteers but conscription was later introduced. The brigades were formally incorporated into the Spanish Army in September 1937, as Spanish Foreign Legion units.|$|R
50|$|A Danish {{subsidiary}} company of Babcock & Wilcox will design and operate the plant, whilst the British construction {{arm of the}} multinational company Interserve will construct the plant and <b>ancillaries.</b> The British <b>company</b> Stobart will collect, process and deliver the biomass to the power plant site after stripping and debarking. Most of the biomass {{is intended to be}} waste wood collected from the local area which will add 40 lorry journeys daily to the surrounding roads. There was an aspiration that some of the waste material would arrive at the Stobart compound in Rotherham by rail transport or that excess pellets created from the wood pelletising process would be railed away from the site, but this is not mentioned in the 2015/2016 documentation. The Stobart site for the biomass project is located on the DB Schenker rail sidings situated just south of the biomass plant.|$|R
40|$|E-health is {{currently}} one, if not the, most dramatic {{developments in the}} healthcare environment.

E-health, while exciting and promising, also presents new challenges, particularly in regard to acceptable standards, choice of technologies, overcoming traditional jurisdictional boundaries, up-front investment, privacy and confidentiality as well as information integrity and quality. In order to address all these issues, healthcare organisations require a framework that brings together these key challenges into a cohesive whole so that appropriate standards and protocols can be developed and then implemented to ensure that the value proposition for e-health can be realised. This paper serves to develop and present such an integrative framework...|$|R

Based on knowledge of the business a number of extra constraints were added that improved its performance and allowed optimal solutions to be obtained. The model has proved to be successful in challenging entrenched views within FCCL regarding strategic direction, and stimulating wide ranging thought and discussion...|$|R
