5|$|Many {{commentators}} {{suggested that}} the 2012 rise in tuition fees in England would put poorer students off <b>applying</b> <b>to</b> university. However, the {{gap between rich and}} poor students has slightly narrowed (from 30.5% in 2010 to 29.8% in 2013) since the introduction of the higher fees. This may be because universities have used tuition fees to invest in bursaries and outreach schemes. In 2016, The Guardian noted that the number of disadvantaged students <b>applying</b> <b>to</b> university had increased by 72% from 2006 to 2015, a bigger rise than in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. It wrote that most of the gap between richer and poorer students tends to open up between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 4 (i.e. at secondary school), rather than when applying for university, and so the money raised from tuition fees should be spent there instead.|$|E

5|$|According to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, {{there are}} three main classifications for immigrants: Family class (persons closely related to Canadian residents), Economic class (admitted {{on the basis of}} a point system that {{accounts}} for age, health and labour-market skills required for cost effectively inducting the immigrants into Canada's labour market) and Refugee class (those seeking protection by <b>applying</b> <b>to</b> remain in the country by way of the Canadian immigration and refugee law). In 2008, there were 65,567 immigrants in the family class, 21,860 refugees, and 149,072 economic immigrants amongst the 247,243 total immigrants to the country.
