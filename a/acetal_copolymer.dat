5000|$|In 1977 {{they made}} the first all-plastic kettles, the Futura. However it was still the 'normal' shape of a kettle, and distrusted (would it melt?), and only when Redring {{introduced}} the Autoboil in 1979 did kettles become the taller jug shape adopted today. Tefal introduced the cordless kettle in 1986. Plastic kettles used the Polyoxymethylene <b>acetal</b> <b>copolymer</b> (POMC), also known as kemetal, celcon, hostaform or ultraform.|$|E
30|$|A sample {{assembly}} {{is shown}} in Fig.  2 b. A cylindrical sample was firstly evacuated and saturated with 0.01  mol/L KCl aqueous solution and assembled with end-pieces. A DURACON (<b>acetal</b> <b>copolymer)</b> piston-cylinder system is inserted in a PEEK end-piece. DURACON and PEEK were selected for their high strength. DURACON can minimize the resistance to the piston movement. RTV rubber {{was used as a}} jacketing material. The sample assembly was attached to the top block of the pressure vessel with two arms and a tie block (Fig.  2 a). Along with the compression in radial directions, the silicone oil between the top block and the upper end-piece and between the tie block and the lower end-piece compresses a sample in the axial direction, causing a hydrostatic compression. The right arm and the tie block are designed to work as a channel for silicone oil (viscosity[*]~[*] 0.1  Pa∙s) to move the lower piston. The upper piston is moved by the silicone oil in a channel through the top block.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Worm gears are {{commonly}} used in windshield wipers and power windows of automobiles. The goal of this work is to study several material problems, such as production bottlenecks and excessive scrap, resulting from the production of steel worm shafts. A possible solution is explored in this work by characterizing material properties of a promising candidate (glass reinforced <b>acetal</b> <b>copolymer)</b> that can replace steel in worm gears. Finite element analysis of the worm thread under static loading and constant temperature is performed in order to calculate {{the size of the}} new composite part. The results obtained in this work support the possibility of manufacturing composite worm shafts that could operate at elevated temperatures without sacrificing part performance, while reducing part weight leading to improved fuel economy, noise reduction, and manufacturing problems associated with the steel part. The finite element analysis shows that compared to a steel gear, the axial pitch of a composite worm gear must be increased by 250 % in order for it to operate without failure for 10 years at a constant temperature of 23 C. This increase in the axial pitch would ramp up to 400 %, if the composite worm gear is expected to operate for 10 years at a constant temperature of 100 C.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a novel hydration sensor that employs osmotic pressure to detectde‐ and overhydration in body fluids. This sensor {{could be used}} to measure different levels of hydration in an organism, e. g. the human body. A prototype was fabricated in an <b>acetal</b> <b>copolymer</b> integrating a semi‐permeable membrane and an electronic interface containing a resistive pressure transducer together with an ASIC and a few discrete components assembled on a silicon substrate. The sensor has a cavity (reference chamber) with a pressure transducer used to record the osmotic pressure induced by the physical separation between two solutions of different salt concentrations: the reference solution (inside the sensor’s cavity) and the external media. The hydration sensor described in this work offers an alternate solution to the methods used today for measuring hydration (sampling of body fluids, skin impedance analysis, body weight, etc.). This makes it less complex, portable, smaller in size, with a low power consumption and capable of continuous measurements. Its low power architecture, in combination with the advances made in microfabrication, make it a suitable candidate for further miniaturization and implantation in the human body. This technology is a versatile medical sensor because of the physical principles it implements, for example: It uses a semi‐permeable membrane for solute selectivity permitting the detection of changes in the concentration of different molecules in the human body which are indicators of changes in the human body electrochemical balance, helping to monitor different pathologies. Making use of the membrane’s physical (porous size and density), chemical and electrical properties one can monitor (through an osmotic process) different solutes/molecules from the extracellular fluids and use the osmotic hydration sensor to sense other parameters, such as diabetes (glucose), kidney function (Sodium concentration), and blood volume (Hemoglobin), where the last parameter described is particularly important for post‐operative care. The sensor presented in this work has three different development stages investigated with the use of other prototype sensors, which paved the way towards a final device, a proof of concept of a novel osmotic hydration sensor that is validated for measuring hydration “in vitro”. The osmotic hydration sensor encapsulation was manufactured in <b>acetal</b> <b>copolymer</b> integrating a 25. 4 μm thick ion‐exchange Nafion (NR 211) membrane and a silicon substrate measuring 10 x 10 mm. Both the pressure transducer and the ASIC were integrated to the substrate. The sensor was tested/validated for a ± 20 % hydration span, ranging from 220 mOsmL‐ 1 (overhydration) to 340 mOsmL‐ 1 (dehydration) and showing a resolution of approximately 2 % with a response time of 5. 5 hours to reach 100 % signal. This result, corresponds to an accuracy of 5. 71 bits for the sensor’s dynamic range. The low power architecture implemented in the ASIC uses a low voltage supply (1 V) in the sub‐threshold regime with bias currents of approximately 50 nA resulting in an average power consumption of only 39. 4 μW. An Analog‐to‐Analog approach converts the voltage signal from the pressure transducer (due to a change in resistance) into a frequency output that, for every transition on the output, inverts the power to the transducer. This approach results in a resistance controlled oscillator (RCO), eliminatingthe use of a power‐consuming clock to drive an Analog to Digital converter (ADC) ...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Funtional ɛCL monomers have been successfully synthesised utilising a primary amine (protected as a CBZ or BOC carbamate) and also a protected ketone (using an acetal protecting group). Amine derivatives were synthesised from the commercially available trans- 4 -aminocyclohexanol. The acetal protected ketone was synthesised from the commercially available 1, 4 -cyclohexanedione monoethylene acetal. The subsequent exposure of these monomers to ring opening polymerisation conditions (using stannous octanoate) {{in the presence of}} ɛCL, yielded random copolymers with a functionalised polyester backbone. The <b>acetal</b> <b>copolymer</b> was successfully deproteceted and reduced to yield an alcohol pendant. A polymer – drug composite was successfully synthesised through the use of this alcohol polymer reacting with ciprofloxacin. A polymer – drug conjugate was also successfully synthesised using surface chemistry on PCL and PLA films. PCL and PLA films were cast as films and subsequently aminolysed using 1, 6 -hexamethylene diamine in aqueous media at pH = 11. 5. These aminolysed films were then treated with both ciprofloxacin and penicillin G, together with amide coupling chemistry to synthesise biologically active surfaces. Ciprofloxacin and penicillin G were successfully attached to the PCL surface with ciprofloxacin being attached to the PLA variant. A functional PCL monomer was also successfully synthesised from the commercially available PCL diol. Both methacrylate and acrylate varients were synthesised through acid chloride chemistry. The acrylate and methacrylate analogue were UV cured using both type I (Irgacure 2959) and II (DETX/EDB) photoinitiators. The relative ratios of these initiators were changed along with the composition of the curing material to investigate curing parameters, to aid in 3 D printing conditions. To achieve viscocity criteria for 3 D printing a ratio of 70 : 30 (PCL DMA:PEG DA) was used, utilising PEG DA as a reactive diluent. A ratio of 3 wt...|$|E
