25|$|Jacks, amberjacks, pompanos, horse mackerel, scads, leatherjackets and {{trevally}} are fish of {{the family}} Carangidae. Found in most coastal waters, they are fast predatory fishes that hunt in the waters above reefs and in the open sea; some dig in the sea floor for invertebrates (some can also filter feed, such as the white trevally). The largest fish in the family, the giant trevally, grows up to 1.7m in length; most fish in the family reach a maximum length of 25–100cm. The family contains many important commercial and game fish, notably the Pacific jack mackerel and the other jack mackerels in the genus Trachurus. The type species of this genus is the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel.</b> Jack mackerels are an important inshore commercial species.|$|E

40|$|Small {{pelagic fish}} are {{the link between}} planktonic {{production}} and higher trophic levels. Competition for resources {{may play a role}} in the population dynamics of species, some of them probably standing out from the others due to greater feeding success. It is therefore important to understand the trophic niche of species overlapping both spatially and temporally. In this study, we have investigated the diet, prey preference, trophic niche breadth and diet overlap of the 8 major small pelagic species (anchovy, sardine, sprat, <b>Atlantic</b> and Mediterranean <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel,</b> bogue, <b>Atlantic</b> mackerel and Atlantic chub mackerel) inhabiting the Bay of Biscay. Results indicate that all fish feed mainly on calanoid copepods, incorporating larger prey like euphausiids and decapods to complete their diet. Differences in ingested prey diversity seem to be more limited by the available zooplankton at sea than by a specific diet preference by fish species, resulting in an overall high diet overlap, especially within clupeids but also between clupeids and other (larger) predator species. Consumption estimations for different prey groups could therefore determine whether such a large diet overlap between small pelagic fish, together with spatial co-occurrence, results in competition or enhances the effects of intraguild predation, which is important in terms of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management...|$|R

40|$|Early {{life history}} traits (ELHTs) {{are key to}} {{understand}} recruitment patterns in marine animals. However, for reef fishes, studies on ELHTs are mainly focused on tropical systems and little is known for temperate reefs. In this study we used SMURFs (Standard Monitoring Units for the Recruitment of Reef Fishes) to collect fish in a temperate rocky reef system (Arrábida Marine Park, Portugal) {{on a weekly basis}} for three months during the recruitment period. Six sub-surface SMURFs sampled 2490 <b>Atlantic</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus trachurus) postlarvae and juveniles. Sagittal and lapilli otoliths were extracted from a subsample of 296 fish and ELHTs, such as size and age at settlement, growth rate and age at first secondary growth formation were examined. Additionally, we tested three growth curves and selected the best suited to back-calculate the hatching pattern based on the lengths of all sampled fish. Standard length ranged from 6. 13 mm to 48. 56 mm and subsampled fish were aged between 19 days to 44 days. Age and size at settlement were estimated between 19 days and 36 days for individuals of 6. 13 mm and 24. 95 mm, respectively. Otolith shape changed clearly with increasing age and, on average, secondary growth started to form on day 33 (± 3 days). Age/length relationship was well described by a Gompertz growth model which was used to back-calculate hatching dates. Four distinct hatching cohorts were identified with fish of the earliest cohort showing a faster body and otolith growth.

High levels of toxins, up to 4800 μg STXeq kg– 1, were registered {{at the peak of}} the bloom (5. 0 103 cells l– 1). The suite of individual PSTs was examined. Decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX) and B 1 constituted nearly 90 % of toxins (on a molar basis) determined in mackerel. This profile of toxins markedly differs from the known profile of toxins produced by G. catenatum strains isolated from the Portuguese coast, which is dominated by N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins, in particular the C 1 + 2 toxins. The prevalence of the potent dcSTX in the pelagic environment and its transfer through the marine food web is highlighted in this study. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> is identified as a high potential vector of PSTs along the Portuguese coast.

40|$|Small pelagic fishes are {{particularly}} abundant {{in areas with}} high environmental variability (zones of coastal upwelling and areas of tidal mixing and river discharge), and because of this, their abundance suffers large inter-annual and inter-decadal fluctuations. In Portugal, the most important species in terms of landings are European sardine, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> and Atlantic chub mackerel. Small pelagic fish landings account for 62. 8 % of the total fish biomass and represent 32. 7 % of the economical value of all catches. We have investigated trends in landings of these small pelagic fishes and detected the effects of environmental factors in this fishery. In order to explain the variability of landings of small pelagic fishes, we have used official landings (1965 - 2012) for trawling and purse seine fisheries and applied generalized linear models, using the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO) (annual and winter NAO index), sea surface temperature (SST), wind data (strength and North-South and East-West wind components) and rainfall, as explanatory variables. Regression {{analysis was used to}} describe the relationship between landings and SST. The models explained between 50. 16 and 51. 07 % of the variability of the LPUE, with the most important factors being winter NAO index, SST and wind strength. The LPUE of European sardine and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> was negatively correlated with SST, and LPUE of Atlantic chub mackerel was positively correlated with SST.

Firstly, mechanical separation inhibited water losses (2. 67 % against 4. 57 and 5. 57 % in whole fillets and burgers from minced muscle, respectively), but the colour of MSM was duller and redder than the samples from other groups. Horse mackerel contained low fat (8 mg MDA-eq/ 100 g muscle). Nevertheless, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> showed a high antioxidant capacity (ABTS, 2, 2 ′-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid, DPPH, 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl, and FRAP, ferric-reducing ability) at T 0 which may protect muscle against oxidative damages both during processing treatment and storage. Industrial relevance The mechanical separation process described in the article has been largely utilized for terrestrial animal products.

40|$|Purpose. Analysis of {{the main}} {{population}} parameters of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> caught in {{different areas of the}} Black Sea in 2011 - 2013. Methodology. Individuals of the Mediterranean <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus mediterraneus Staindachner, 1868) were caught by bottom traps in the coastal area of Sevastopol, as well as by trawls in areas of the South Coast, Alushta-Sudak, cape Takil from 2011 to 2013. The ichthiological data for Balaklavskaya and Sevastopolskaya (including Peschanaya, Karantinnaya, Alexandrovskaya bays, an open area in front of Karantinnaya and Peschanaya bays) bays were separated.
