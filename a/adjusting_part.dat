Trickett uses one of the Dieppe maps in the highly decorated [...] "Vallard" [...] atlas of 1547 to demonstrate this. Trickett claims that Mendonça travelled down {{the east coast of}} Australia, sailing into Botany Bay and then around Wilsons Promontory to Kangaroo Island, before returning to Portuguese-controlled Malacca via the North Island of New Zealand. He also claims the Portuguese charted the Western Australian coast, as far south as the southwest tip of Australia. Trickett claims that the French Vallard maps were composed of several portolan charts that were incorrectly assembled from now lost Portuguese charts.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} <b>adjusting</b> <b>parts</b> {{of the public}} domain cryptographic library LibTomCrypt {{so that it can}} be used on an embedded platform Rabbit 3000. The hash functions MD 5, SHA- 1 and RIPEMD- 128, the Blowfish cipher and CBC block cipher mode have been successfully ported to this platform. These algorithms have been analysed by measuring of the exectution time for the computational power requirements, especially with regard to the length of the input data. The abovementioned hash functions showed non-linear relationship between the execution time and the length of input, the graph of which is like that of a step function. The non-existence of the relationship to the data values was confirmed. The measurements with Blowfish cipher in CBC block cipher mode showed that inicialization of cipher is time consuming (it lasted almost one second on the hardware used) and that it does not depend on the keysize or length of input. The encryption and decryption itself showed a linear relationship to input data length. In the scope of this thesis there was also verification of correct function of SSL/TLS library from the producer of Rabbit microprocessor by creating a HTTPS server and verifying that secure connection with the web browser has been established. The library worked correctly according to manual without any significant problems...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{a finite}} element procedure using the Disturbed State Concept constitutive models is {{proposed for the}} thermomechanical analysis of electronics packaging problems. First, microelectronics packaging types and the problems facing the electronics industry are discussed. Next, the literature {{in the field of}} constitutive models and the finite element procedures available for microelectronics packaging materials and interfaces is reviewed. The previous formulation of the Disturbed State Concept is modified so that different stresses and different strains are allowed in the intact and the fully <b>adjusted</b> <b>parts</b> of the material. Furthermore, the thermo elasto-viscoplastic with disturbance constitutive model is improved to handle the continuous temperature change and the hold time. These last features enhance the model {{so that it can be}} used in a finite element code to simulate the behavior of the microelectronics packaging materials and interfaces in temperature cycling. A new finite element procedure is developed to implement the improved Disturbed State Concept formulation. The finite element procedure includes a wide range of material models, starting from the linear elastic to thermo elasto-viscoplastic with disturbance. In order to eliminate the finite element mesh sensitivity encountered in strain-softening materials, a new procedure is proposed. The Disturbed State Average Strain method reduces or eliminates the finite element mesh sensitivity. This is proved through a number of example problems. The proposed finite element procedure is verified against a number of sets of experimental data obtained from the literature...|$|R
40|$|The shear {{viscosity}} to entropy density ratio, η /s, characterizes how perfect a fluid is. We {{calculate the}} leading order η /s of a gluon plasma in perturbation using the kinetic theory. The leading order contribution only involves the elastic gg -> gg (22) {{process and the}} inelastic gg ggg (23) process. The Hard-Thermal-Loop (HTL) treatment {{is used for the}} 22 matrix element, while the exact matrix element in vacuum is supplemented by the gluon Debye mass insertion for the 23 process. Also, the asymptotic mass is used for the external gluons in the kinetic theory. The errors from not implementing HTL and the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect in the 23 process, and from the uncalculated higher order corrections, are estimated. Our result for η /s lies between that of Arnold, Moore and Yaffe (AMY) and Xu and Greiner (XG). Our result shows that although the finite angle contributions are important at intermediate α_s (α_s ∼ 0. 01 - 0. 1), the 22 process is still more important than 23 when α_s < 0. 1. This is in qualitative agreement with AMY's result. We find no indication that the proposed perfect fluid limit η /s ≃ 1 /(4 π) can be achieved by perturbative QCD alone.
