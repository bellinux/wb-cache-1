40|$|Sexual {{differentiation}} across taxa {{may be due}} {{to genetic}} sex determination (GSD) and/or temperature sex determination (TSD). In many mammals, males are heterogametic (XY); whereas females are homogametic (XX). In most birds, the opposite is the case with females being heterogametic (ZW) and males the homogametic sex (ZZ). Many reptile species lack sex chromosomes, and instead, sexual differentiation is influenced by temperature with specific temperatures promoting males or females varying across species possessing this form of sexual differentiation, although TSD has recently been shown to override GSD in Australian central beaded dragons (Pogona vitticeps). There has been speculation that <b>Australian</b> <b>Brush-turkeys</b> (Alectura lathami) exhibit TSD alone and/or in combination with GSD. Thus, we sought to determine if this species possesses sex chromosomes. Blood was collected from one sexually mature female and two sexually mature males residing at Sylvan Heights Bird Park (SHBP) and shipped for karyotype analysis. Karyotype analysis revealed that contrary to speculation, <b>Australian</b> <b>Brush-turkeys</b> possess the classic avian ZW/ZZ sex chromosomes. It remains a possibility that a biased primary sex ratio of <b>Australian</b> <b>Brush-turkeys</b> might be influenced by maternal condition prior to ovulation that result in her laying predominantly Z- or W-bearing eggs and/or sex-biased mortality due to higher sensitivity of one sex in environmental conditions. A better understanding of how maternal and extrinsic factors might differentially modulate ovulation of Z- or W-bearing eggs and hatching of developing chicks possessing ZW or ZZ sex chromosomes could be essential in conservation strategies used to save endangered members of Megapodiidae...|$|R

These {{related to the}} process of mound acquisiton (whether by construction or usurpation) and the number of mounds (one or two) maintained by males per breeding season. Mound ownership appeared to be a prerequisite for mating success. A common alternative mating tactic exhibited by numerous moundless males involved interloping on the mounds of other males; none of these were successful in obtaining copulations. The males most successful in receiving visits from laying females were those main-taining two mounds: these males received a mean of 34 eggs, compared with 18 eggs received by males building one mound. Males that rebuilt after initial expulsion received eight eggs per season. Males appeared able to maximize their mating success by reducing the number of alternative incubation sites by expelling other males, and to minimize the extreme energetic costs of mound construction by usurping established mounds.

When raised in outdoor aviaries, without adults, four of six males built incubation mounds {{at an early age}} of 4. 5 â€“ 9 months.

Every variety of plan or dodge or expedient has been adopted in turn to secure the self-same end; and provided only it succeeds in securing it, any variety of them all is equally satisfactory. One might parallel it with the case of hatching birds' eggs. Most birds sit upon their eggs themselves, and supply the necessary warmth from their own bodies. But any alternative plan that attains the same end does just as well. The felonious cuckoo drops her foundlings unawares in another bird's nest: the ostrich trusts her unhatched offspring to {{the heat of the}} burning desert sand: and the <b>Australian</b> <b>brush-turkeys,</b> with vicarious maternal instinct, collect great mounds of decaying and fermenting leaves and rubbish, in which they deposit their eggs to be artificially incubated, as it were, by the slow heat generated in the process of putrefaction.

Here, we evaluated their response to acoustic cues, which usually {{play an important role}} in avian social cognition. However, in simultaneous choice tests, neither 2 -day-old nor 9 -day-old chicks preferred the choice arm with playback of either chick or adult conspecific calls over the arm containing a silent loudspeaker.

We also presented the chicks with robotic models, either with or without playback of chick calls. They did not approach the calling robot more than they did the silent robot, indicating that the combination of visual and acoustic cues does not evoke a stronger response. These results will allow further comparison with species that face similar cognitive demands in the wild, such as brood parasites. Such a comparative approach, which is the focus of cognitive ecology, will enable us to further analyse the evolution and adaptive value of species recognition abilities. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Megapods are {{the only}} birds that rely upon {{external}} heat sources for incubation. In <b>Australian</b> <b>brush-turkeys</b> Alectura lathami, males build large mounds of organic material, in which several females then bury their eggs. Incubation heat is produced by microbial decomposition of the organic material and can range from 30 - 38 degrees Celsius, averaging 34 degrees Celsius. We incubated freshly-laid eggs at 31 degrees Celsius, 34 degrees Celsius and 36 degree Celsius and found that, while the ratio of males to females at 34 degrees Celsius was almost 1 : 1, {{there was a significant}} difference in sex ratio between 31 degrees Celsius and 36 degrees Celcius: more females hatched at the higher temperature and more males at the lower one. Chicks from the hot and cold temperatures were of similar size, but they differed considerably in weight. 'Cold' chicks were significantly lighter, most likely because they had used up all their yolk reserve during the much longer incubation period. Behavioural observations revealed that heavier hatchlings dug themselves out of their underground nests more rapidly. In nature, they would hence disperse with a larger remaining yolk reserve. Incubation temperature is thus likely to have an effect on survival. Results also raise the intriguing possibility that adults could actively manipulate sex ratios through the choice (by females) and maintenance (by males) of incubation sites. We anticipate that the effects of incubation temperature will prove to be critical for understanding the behavioural ecology of megapodes. 1 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Megapodes are {{exceptional}} among birds {{because they}} use external heat sources for incubating their eggs. In <b>Australian</b> <b>brush-turkeys</b> (Alectura lathami), this source is the heat produced by microbial decomposition in mounds of leaf litter. A recent laboratory {{study showed that}} artificial incubation of eggs at different temperatures affects the sex ratio of brush-turkey hatchlings. Here, this phenomenon is confirmed for eggs incubated in natural incubation mounds. Eggs from which females hatched were found at significantly higher incubation temperatures in the mounds (mean 33. 7 Â°C) than those from which males hatched (mean 32. 9 Â°C). Also, sex ratios of chicks from individual mounds were significantly correlated with mean incubation temperatures in those mounds. Furthermore, incubation temperatures differed significantly between incubation mounds during the same month of the year. Within some mounds, incubation temperatures differed up to 9 Â°C between eggs, in others this difference was only up to 1 Â°C. These latter results show that males differ {{in their ability to}} maintain stable incubation temperatures. While the effect of incubation temperatures on sex ratio is a novel discovery for any bird, it was previously suggested that incubation temperatures in megapodes also affect embryo mortality and chick survival. These combined effects of incubation temperature, and the limited ability of males to provide optimal temperatures, seem to provide answers to the question why so few birds have adopted this unusual mode of reproduction â€“ a question asked by many behavioural ecologists and evolutionary biologists. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{coercion}} by males {{is generally}} understood {{to have three}} forms: forced copulation, harassment and intimidation. We studied <b>Australian</b> <b>brush-turkeys,</b> Alectura lathami, to determine whether some male behaviours towards females at incubation mounds {{could be classified as}} aggressive, whether males were attempting sexual coercion and, if so, whether the coercion was successful. We found that some male behaviours towards females {{were significantly more likely to}} be followed by the cessation of female mound activity, and hence could be classified as aggressive, while others were significantly more likely to be followed by the commencement of female mound activity, and hence could be classified as enticing. Copulation was preceded by higher rates of male enticement and by higher rates of certain types of male aggression. It therefore seemed that males were attempting sexual coercion. There was little evidence, however, that this combination of coercion and enticement was successful in obtaining copulations. While forced copulation did occur, it was infrequent, and no evidence could be found for intimidation. We conclude that harassment is the primary form of sexual coercion by male brush-turkeys. Although sexual coercion is understood to be a sub-optimal tactic, brush-turkey sexual coercion was employed as a primary tactic by dominant males who owned incubation mounds. One possible explanation for this apparent paradox is that aggression is the default solution for social conflicts in this species, and hence can be interpreted as a behavioural syndrome. 7 page(s...|$|R

40|$|To our knowledge, there is, so far, no {{evidence}} that incubation temperature can affect sex ratios in birds, although this is common in reptiles. Here, we show that incubation temperature does affect sex ratios in megapodes, which are exceptional among birds because they use environmental heat sources for incubation. In the <b>Australian</b> <b>brush-turkey</b> Alectura lathami, a mound-building megapode, more males hatch at low incubation temperatures and more females hatch at high temperatures, whereas the proportion is 1 â€Š:â€Š 1 at the average temperature found in natural mounds. Chicks from lower temperatures weigh less, which probably affects offspring survival, but are not smaller. Megapodes possess heteromorphic sex chromosomes like other birds, which eliminates temperature-dependent sex determination, as described for reptiles, as the mechanism behind the skewed sex ratios at high and low temperatures. Instead, our data suggest a sex-biased temperature-sensitive embryo mortality because mortality was greater at the lower and higher temperatures, and minimal at the middle temperature where the sex ratio was 1 â€Š:â€Š 1...|$|E

Here, we investigated the causes of this temperature-dependent sex-biasing system. Molecular sexing of chicks and embryos confirmed that male embryo mortality was greater at high temperatures while female embryo mortality is greater at low temperatures, with mortality in both sexes similar at intermediate incubation temperatures. Temperature-dependent sex-biased embryo mortality represents a novel mechanism of altering sex ratios in birds.

40|$|Populations of a {{host species}} may exhibit {{different}} assemblages of parasites and other symbionts. The loss of certain species of symbionts (lineage sorting, or ''missing-the-boat'') is a mechanism by which geographical variation in symbiont assemblages can arise. We studied feather mites and lice from <b>Australian</b> <b>brush-turkeys</b> (Aves: Megapodiidae: Alectura lathami) and expected to observe geographical structuring in arthropod assemblages for several reasons. First, because the brush-turkey is a sedentary ground-dwelling bird, we predicted that geographically close host populations should share more similar arthropod assemblages than distant ones. Second, because brush-turkeys do not brood their young, vertical transfer of arthropods is unlikely, and brush-turkeys probably acquire their mites and lice at social maturity through contact with other birds. Young birds could disperse and found new populations without carrying complete sets of symbionts. We predicted that young birds would have fewer species of arthropods than older birds; in addition, we expected that males (which are polygynous) would have more species than females. Birds were sampled from 12 sites (5 populations) along {{the east coast of}} Queensland, Australia, that were separated by a distance of 12. 5 - 2, 005 km. In total, 5 species of mites from the Pterolichidae and 1 species from the Ascouracaridae were found. Two species of lice were collected but in numbers too low to be statistically useful. Differentiation of mite assemblages was evident; in particular, Leipobius sp. showed 100 % prevalence in 3 host populations and 0 % in the remaining 9. A dendrogram of brush-turkey populations based on mite assemblages showed 2 geographically correlated clusters of sites, plus 1 cluster that contained 2 sites near Brisbane and 1 approximately at a distance of 1, 000 km. There was no strong effect of host age or sex on number of mite species carried. Horizontal transfer of feather mites by hippoboscid flies, in addition to physical contact between hosts, {{may play a role in}} homogenizing symbiont assemblages within populations.

40|$|Infection is an {{important}} source of mortality for avian embryos but parental behaviors and eggs themselves can provide a network of antimicrobial defenses. Mound builders (Aves: Megapodiidae) are unique among birds in that they produce heat for developing embryos not by sitting on eggs but by burying them in carefully tended mounds of soil and microbially decomposing vegetation. The low infection rate of eggs of one species in particular, the <b>Australian</b> <b>brush-turkey</b> (Alectura lathami), suggests that they possess strong defensive mechanisms. To identify some of these mechanisms, we first quantified antimicrobial albumen proteins and characterized eggshell structure, finding that albumen was not unusually antimicrobial, but that eggshell cuticle was composed of nanometer-sized calcite spheres. Experimental tests revealed that these modified eggshells were significantly more hydrophobic and better at preventing bacterial attachment and penetration into the egg contents than chicken eggs. Our results suggest that these mechanisms may contribute to the antimicrobial defense system of these eggs, and may provide inspiration for new biomimetic anti-fouling surfaces. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Almost all birds {{depend upon}} early {{experience}} with adults and siblings to learn recognition cues. Megapodes, {{such as the}} <b>Australian</b> <b>brush-turkey</b> (Alectura lathami), have evolved a very different life history. Eggs are incubated in mounds of decaying organic material. Chicks hatch asynchronously and receive no parental care, so imprinting cannot occur. Nevertheless, chicks subsequently form groups with similar-aged conspecifics. We explored the perceptual basis of this aggregation response, focussing on likely visual cues, such as pecking movements and body colour. Experiments were conducted under naturalistic conditions in a large aviary, using realistic robot models and colour filters. The robots successfully evoked a range of social responses resembling those of a live companion. Aggregation depended upon both behaviour and morphology. Simultaneous choice tests revealed that brush-turkey chicks preferred a pecking robot over either a static model or a scanning robot, suggesting that responsiveness depends upon particular movement patterns. In addition, chicks were sensitive to changes in appearance but only those that affected radiance at short wavelengths. The mechanism underlying social aggregation after hatching hence involves relatively specific cues. This perceptual bias seems to be largely experience independent and may exploit attributes to which potential predators are insensitive. 10 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The megapode {{hatchling}} receives no care or {{guidance from}} its parents and so {{must be able}} to survive by itself. This raises some basic questions about the innate abilities of megapode hatchlings, including the possibility of predator recognition. Experiments were conducted to investigate the visual predator recognition abilities of the hatchlings of the <b>Australian</b> <b>brush-turkey</b> Alectura lathami J. E. Gray, 1831.

The hatchlings did not respond with any escape or avoidance behaviours when presented with predator stimuli. Although there are a number of potential explanations for these results, it is most likely that the responses observed were genuine, indicating that brush-turkey hatchlings do not instinctively flee in response to the visual presence or movement of a predator. In the wild, they may adopt the strategy of freezing, as do hatchlings of the malleefowl Leipoa ocellata Gould, 1840.

40|$|Males of the {{polyandrous}} <b>Australian</b> <b>Brush-turkey</b> (Alectura lathami) build {{mounds of}} leaf litter, in which incubation heat {{is produced by}} microbial decomposition. Females lay eggs singly, at intervals of several days, over many months. For each egg, they select an incubation mound in which to lay, and they then typically copulate with the male mound-owner; mound choice is, thus, usually equal to mate choice. Freed from incubation and maternal care, these females can invest considerable time and energy in assessing and choosing their potential mates. Low or high incubation temperatures inside the mounds have negative effects on embryos and chicks, and temperatures vary considerably both between and within mounds. Here, I show that mounds with mean incubation temperatures ranging from approximately 32 Â°C to 35 Â°C received more eggs than cooler or warmer mounds. Similarly, when the size of each egg was compared with its temperature when found in the mound, larger eggs were deposited mainly in mound material at temperatures between approximately 32 Â°C and 35 Â°C, whereas smaller eggs were laid at temperatures above and below this range. Egg size was included as a factor describing female mate choice, because egg size in relation to body size is exceptionally large, which indicates considerable female investment. Overall, {{these results suggest that}} the temperature in the malesâ€™ incubation mounds considerably affects female mate choice. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Birds usually {{influence}} offspring survival {{through the}} amount of parental care they provide. Megapodes have evolved a different life history. Eggs are incubated by external heat sources, and chicks dig themselves out of their underground nest and live independently of their parents. Egg size {{is one of the}} few means by which females can influence chick survival. We found that in the <b>Australian</b> <b>Brush-turkey,</b> Alectura lathami Gray, 1831, eggs and hatchlings varied considerably in size, with a ratio of 1. 62 between the largest and the smallest egg. Egg size was positively correlated with hatchling body mass and tarsus length. It also significantly predicted the chicks' motor performance: chicks from larger eggs dug their way out of their underground nest faster and were more active when kept in a resting box and monitored by motion detection software. The main advantage of reaching the surface more quickly is likely that such chicks will have more time to find suitable food, refuge, and a tree for roosting at night while still feeding on their internal yolk reserves. Egg size also interacted significantly with body mass during the first 10 months of life. A size advantage at hatching thus seems to have an immediate effect on motor performance and a longer term effect on the ability to gain mass. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Dispersal {{and habitat}} {{selectivity}} of young precocial birds is usually determined by parents, as these lead their chicks after hatching. Megapode chicks receive no parental care and {{little is known}} about factors determining their dispersal and habitat selectivity. Here, we present such results for the <b>Australian</b> <b>brush-turkey</b> (Alectura lathami). Chicks were radio-tracked in two small remnant rainforest patches (Mary Cairncross Rainforest Park and Aplin Forest) from their second day of life and for up to 30 days. At Mary Cairncross Rainforest Park, the median dispersal distance was significantly affected by age, as it decreased from approximately 100 m on each of the first five days to around 50 m per day thereafter. At Aplin Forest, age had no significant effect on dispersal. The difference between the two sites can be explained by incorporating habitat selectivity. Chicks preferred to stay in thickets and avoided the more open rainforest, as evident from time selectivity indices calculated for both habitats. At Aplin Forest, 31 % of the area was covered by thickets, such as lantana (Lantana camara) and raspberry (Rubus ssp.), whereas at Mary Cairncross Rainforest Park this proportion was only 6 %. Management plans for endangered megapodes should consider the role of thickets in the chicks' dispersal behaviour, and thus in population spread, recolonisation and gene flow. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential for wildlife feeding to artificially increase population densities of the <b>Australian</b> <b>brush-turkey,</b> Alectura lathami and assessed the indirect adverse effects that this may have on surrounding forest floor vegetation. Census counts and observations of feeding activity conducted in recreation areas of Australia's Gold Coast hinterland confirmed that brush-turkey population densities were significantly elevated by the provision of food by humans. Brush-turkey densities were high at sites where birds are actively fed, moderate at sites where birds feed opportunistically and low at sites where humans have negligible impact on local food availability. Brush-turkeys caused significant environmental impact at sites where their population densities have been substantially elevated by active feeding. Across all sites, increases in brush-turkey density were accompanied by a significant decline in ground cover, leaf litter weight, seed density and seedling density. Natural environmental variables such as gradient, vegetation type and canopy cover did not explain the observed impacts. The impacts were consistent with those described in trampling studies and suggest that at high density, even small animals can have significant trampling impacts on their local environment. This study demonstrates that wildlife feeding can have detrimental impacts on the integrity of local environments and recommends greater consideration of small animals and their potential indirect impacts when regulating wildlife feeding in National Parks and other nature conservation areas.

40|$|Maternal hormones are an {{excellent}} pathway for the mother to influence offspring development, and birds provide exceptional opportunities to study these hormone-mediated maternal effects. Two dominant hypotheses about the function of yolk androgens in avian eggs concern maternal manipulation of sibling competition and post hatching paternal care. In megapodes, however, neither sibling competition nor post hatching parental care exists. Eggs are incubated by external heat sources, and chicks dig themselves out of their underground nest and live independently of their parents and their siblings. In this first study on egg androgens of such a megapode, the <b>Australian</b> <b>Brush-turkey</b> Alectura lathami, we found nevertheless substantial amounts of maternal androgens. Since size of the incubation mound, incubation temperature, egg size and laying date greatly vary in this species, we analysed variation in testosterone (T), androstenedione (A 4) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in relation to these factors. T concentrations were significantly higher in eggs from bigger mounds and laid at greater depth, which may compensate via anabolic effects for the longer duration and higher energetic requirements of chicks when digging themselves out. T concentrations were higher in smaller eggs, and both yolk A 4 and T concentrations increased with laying date, perhaps as a compensatory measure, while DHT concentrations only varied across different mounds. These results indicate that maternal androgens may influence offspring development outside the contexts of sibling competition or parental care. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Malleefowl are unquestionably the {{aberrant}} megapode: all of {{the other}} 21 species live in subtropical and tropical regions, mainly in dense rainforests where the construction of incubation mounds is relatively straighforward. Malleefowl are of particular interest because they have somehow managed to adapt what would have been a life in the jungle to millennia of relentless drying. Coping with extreme climate change is possible but requires sophisticated adaptations. Comparisons with the two more northern megapodes that occur in Australia - the <b>Australian</b> <b>Brush-turkey</b> and the Orange-footed Scrubfowl - provides an assessment of the extent of this adaptation in Malleefowl as well as an opportunity to learn how the other species are faring. Although many megapodes remain seriously threatened, these two Australian species have learned how to live successfully among people, in some locations such as Brisbane, Darwin and Cairns, becoming nuisances in urban areas. Despite its abundance, however, the scrubfowl remains poorly studied. On the other hand, continuing work on the brush-turkey has greatly enhanced our understanding of the species and of many aspects that are common to the family as a whole. Of particular importance is the recent discovery of a specialised form of temperature sex determination in brush-turkeys in which different levels of mound heat result in highly skewed sex ratios. This presentation will review some of these recent findings, highlighting issues of particular relevance to Malleefowl conservation and ecology.

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} problems {{in the study of}} behavioural development is understanding the mechanisms by which animals recognize conspecifics. Species recognition is important because it ensures short-term survival and influences mate choice decisions in adulthood. In most birds and mammals, offspring initially associate with their parents; early experience thus plays a critical role. But one remarkable group of Australian birds, the megapods, reveals that other developmental pathways can evolve: chicks do not meet their parents after hatching and thus have no opportunity to learn from them. Here we describe recent work on species recognition in chicks of the <b>Australian</b> <b>brush-turkey</b> Alectura Lathami. Simultaneous choice experiments using taxidermically-prepared robots presented under optical filters show that socially-naive hatchlings prefer to approach conspecifics of similar colour and that short wavelengths are responsible for this effect. In addition, chicks prefer moving robots to static ones, and pecking movements to a control in which the head sweeps from side to side. Morphology and behaviour hence act synergistically to account for the aggregation response. We discuss the implication of these results for the current debate concerning species recognition and speciation. In northern Queensland, two megapode species (the brush-turkey and the Orange-footed megapode Megapodius reinwardt) occur sympatrically and incubate their eggs in the same incubation mounds. Chicks look similar to the human eye. The mechanisms responsible for species recognition are thus likely to be highly specific, ensuring that no "mistakes" in mate choice are made and no interbreeding occurs. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Our {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} the extent of isoleucine epimerisation (A/I) in fragments of avian eggshells provides geochronological information in archaeological contexts. In the archaeological sequence of Hay Cave, northern Queensland, Australia, there is an excellent correspondence between the A/I values of <b>Australian</b> <b>brush-turkey</b> (Alectura lathami) eggshells (n = 99) and independent geochronological control (n = 16 radiocarbon ages including 4 on eggshell calcite). The A/I values identify three phases of deposition during the Holocene at Hay Cave. In contrast to the Alectura eggshell A/I values, a poor correspondence was observed between the A/I values of cassowary (Casuarius) eggshells from Toe (n = 35) and Kria caves (n = 23) (Ayamaru Plateau, Papua) and the depths from which the specimens were recovered in these stratified sequences. Given coherent archaeofauna trends and radiocarbon chronologies (n = 8 and 2 eggshell calcite radiocarbon ages at Toe and Kria, respectively) with respect to depth, the variable A/I values are not explicable in terms of mixing. Rather, the variability is most likely due to exposure of the eggshells to the high temperatures of campfires. Despite the variability, eggshells with relatively low A/I values amongst specimens recovered from similar depths (and therefore presumably least influenced by high temperatures) exhibit a gradual increase in A/I with respect to depth, as expected in a stratified deposit. From this observation {{it is suggested that}} the identification of heated eggshells will increase confidence in geochronological information provided by A/I. These studies illustrate the complications that arise from campfire-induced acceleration of amino acid racemisation and emphasise that although this phenomenon is common, it is not universally encountered in archaeological contexts...|$|E
