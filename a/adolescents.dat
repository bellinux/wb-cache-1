5|$|OCD {{occurs in}} 15 to 30 people per 100,000 {{in the general}} {{population}} each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active <b>adolescents.</b> Because their bones are still growing, <b>adolescents</b> are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in <b>adolescents</b> {{can be attributed to the}} bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. Franz König coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an inflammation of the bone–cartilage interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, osteonecrosis, accessory ossification center, osteochondrosis, and hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia. Some authors have used the terms osteochondrosis dissecans and osteochondral fragments as synonyms for OCD.|$|E

Participants reported on the strategy used to force a person into sexual contact (defined as sexual touching, sexual intercourse or oral sex) against his/her will. Results showed that around 8 % of the <b>adolescent</b> females and 10 % of the <b>adolescent</b> males reported having used sexual aggression against a person. However, prevalence rates differed for the different samples: the juvenile institution sample showed the highest rate. Further, we found that for <b>adolescent</b> females "beliefs about sexual behaviour" was the only predictor of sexually aggressive behaviour, while for <b>adolescent</b> males being a victim of sexual abuse {{was the most important}} predictor.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the associations between <b>adolescent</b> individuation and concurrent {{and long term}} adjustment in adoptive families. Individuation was assessed using an observational measure examining behaviors and communications demonstrative of individuality and connectedness between each parent and the <b>adolescent.</b> Findings {{did not support the}} hypothesized connection between <b>adolescent</b> individuation and concurrent and long term adjustment in adoptive families. However, further analyses revealed particular importance of connectedness between <b>adolescent</b> and parent for <b>adolescent</b> adjustment, which was found to vary by <b>adolescent</b> gender. Specifically, analyses revealed that gender interacts with both adolescent-father connectedness and mother-adolescent connectedness in predicting <b>adolescent</b> internalizing symptoms; for <b>adolescent</b> males, internalizing symptoms were found to decrease as mother-adolescent connectedness increases. These findings suggest a shift in the understanding of individuated parent-adolescent relationships from comprising co-existing individuality and connectedness to connected relationships which allow for, support, and foster <b>adolescent</b> individuality and autonomy. These results also highlight the particular value of the mother-adolescent relationship for <b>adolescent</b> adjustment in adoptive families. Additionally, cross-informant ratings of <b>adolescent</b> and young adult adjustment were examined within and across time in this adoptive family sample.

40|$|This multi-method study {{explored}} {{the link between}} sports involvement during the high school years and sexual behavior/health among 176 <b>adolescent</b> women. The current study employed quantitative methodology to replicate the documented connections between sports involvement and <b>adolescent</b> women's sexual behavior and sexual/reproductive health, but used more sensitive and appropriate measures. Additionally, in part directed by cultural resource theory, the present study helped {{to fill a gap}} in the literature by exploring three potential explanatory mechanisms (i. e., mediators) in the above connections. Those mechanisms included: (a) functional body orientation; (b) self-empowerment/efficacy; and (c) sexual/reproductive health-related information/motivation via coach. Results from the quantitative data suggested that <b>adolescent</b> women's involvement in organized team sports was favorably associated with each of the following: (a) sexual risk-taking behavior, (b) sexual/reproductive health-seeking behavior, and (c) sexual/reproductive health. In addition, both <b>adolescent</b> women's functional body orientation and <b>adolescent</b> women's self-empowerment/efficacy emerged as mediators in the associations between <b>adolescent</b> women's sports involvement and <b>adolescent</b> women's sexual behavior/health. Thus, the current study suggests the potential for sports involvement to favorably influence <b>adolescent</b> women's sexual behavior/health and pinpoints key mechanisms that help to clarify the nature of that influence. The current study used qualitative methodology to explore {{the ways in which the}} <b>adolescent</b> women felt that their sports involvement influenced their lives and feelings about their bodies. In general, the sports involvement-derived outcomes that emerged from the <b>adolescent</b> women's written comments were positive, suggesting that the <b>adolescent</b> women felt that their sports involvement during their high school years was overwhelmingly beneficial. Potential implications of those outcomes for the sexual/reproductive health of <b>adolescent</b> women are discussed. Qualitative methodology also was used in the current study to explore <b>adolescent</b> women's experience of sexual/reproductive health-related coach talk. Based on the <b>adolescent</b> women's reports of their experiences of such coach talk, it appears that coaches might be one logical and effective avenue by which key sexual/reproductive health messages can be transmitted to <b>adolescent</b> female athletes.
