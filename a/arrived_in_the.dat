5|$|The Spanish {{probably}} obtained spotted horses through {{trade with}} southern Austria and Hungary, where the color pattern {{was known to}} exist. The Conquistadors and Spanish settlers then brought some vividly marked horses to the Americas when they first <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 16th century. One horse with snowflake patterning was listed with the 16 horses brought to Mexico by Cortez, and additional spotted horses were mentioned by Spanish writers by 1604. Others <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western hemisphere when spotted horses went out of style in late 18th-century Europe, and were shipped to Mexico, California and Oregon.|$|E

Most of the Filipino migrants are Tausūgs (Suluk) coming from the southern parts of Philippines. The city also is home to immigrants from Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|As more {{settlers}} <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Northwest in the 1930s and 1940s, {{civic leaders}} advocated {{a system of}} hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River.
