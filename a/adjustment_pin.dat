50|$|Creating a sewer's muslin (also called toile using calico), {{similar to}} a garment template, is one method of fitting. Muslin {{material}} is inexpensive and is {{easy to work with}} when making quick <b>adjustments</b> by <b>pinning</b> the fabric around the wearer or a dress form. The sewer cuts muslin pieces using the same method that they will use for the actual garment, according to a pattern. The muslin pieces are then fit together and darts and other adjustments are made. This provides the sewer with measurements to use as a guideline for marking the pattern pieces and cutting the fabric for the finished garment.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} MQP was {{to design}} and develop a device that can provide support and {{stability}} to students who participate in therapeutic gait training using the buoyant forces of water. During aquatic rehabilitation, students often have difficulty in maintaining stability as they walk and sometimes use a land walker for stability, however land walkers are not intended {{for use in the}} pool and can be difficult to use. The MQP group worked with a group of seven students at the Massachusetts Hospital School to represent a range of the body sizes that the device must accommodate. A list of design specifications were determined and included: the weight of the device should be greater than the buoyant force on the device so that it rests {{on the floor of the}} pool, it must be made of non-corrosive materials to prevent oxidation, it should resist tipping when in use, and the components of the device (straps, handgrips, height level) should be adjustable to accommodate several body types. The design team developed a prototype of a ring walker, which involved a frame, armrests, a belt, and four wheels. The prototype was then evaluated in a series of tests that determined its volume, weight, center of mass, and the buoyant force acting on the device. Testing of the device by a rehabilitation engineer and a student at the Massachusetts Hospital School indicated that the device was generally stable, but the height <b>adjustment</b> <b>pins</b> were difficult to manipulate. The final device was created by incorporating the suggestions from the testing process and staff and students at the Massachusetts Hospital School were satisfied with the stability that the device provided when used in conjunction with aquatic rehabilitation...|$|R

50|$|A cheaper, less {{accurate}} {{version of}} the lever escapement is used in alarm clocks, kitchen timers, mantel clocks and, until the late 1970s, cheap watches, called the Roskopf, pin-lever, or pin-pallet escapement after Georges Frederic Roskopf, who invented it in 1867. It functions similarly to the lever, except that the lever pallet jewels are replaced by vertical metal pins. In a lever escapement, the pallets have two angled faces, the locking face and the impulse face, which must be carefully adjusted to the correct angles. In the pin pallet escapement, these two faces are designed {{into the shape of}} the escape wheel teeth instead, eliminating complicated <b>adjustments.</b> The <b>pins</b> are located symmetrically on the lever, making beat adjustment simpler. Watches that used these escapements were called pin lever watches, and have been superseded by cheap quartz watches.|$|R

40|$|Moulding plays a {{paramount}} role in {{our daily}} life. Traditional moulding is often dedicated and expensive. As the current market trend moves from mass production towards small batch and large variation production, the demand for a mould that can reconfigure itself for different components is greater than ever. The reconfiguration of mould is often realized through discrete pins. Previous research in that field had focused on the hardware of pin actuation {{in order to move}} pins up or down to represent different components and lock the pins at certain positions. Little research has been conducted into support software development that enables rapid reconfiguration of discrete pins to represent component geometry. This paper addresses a new method of software development for the reconfigurable mould utilising discrete pins. The overall aim of the method is to provide an interface for generic discrete pin tooling in order to enable quick reconfiguration of the mould to represent component geometry. The software is composed of three parts: part discretization, pin matrix construction and <b>adjustment</b> and <b>pin</b> matrix verification...|$|R

40|$|Cross-talk between plant {{cells and}} their {{surroundings}} requires tight regulation of information exchange at the plasma membrane (PM), which involves dynamic adjustments of PM protein localization and turnover to modulate signal perception and solute transport at {{the interface between}} cells and their surroundings. In animals and fungi, turnover of PM proteins is controlled by reversible ubiquitylation, which signals endocytosis and delivery to the cell’s lytic compartment, and there is emerging evidence for related mechanisms in plants. Here, we describe the fate of Arabidopsis PIN 2 protein, required for directional cellular efflux of the phytohormone auxin, and identify cis- and trans-acting mediators of PIN 2 ubiquitylation. We demonstrate that ubiquitin acts as a principal signal for PM protein endocytosis in plants and reveal dynamic <b>adjustments</b> in <b>PIN</b> 2 ubiquitylation coinciding with variations in vacuolar targeting and proteolytic turnover. We show that control of PIN 2 proteolytic turnover via its ubiquitylation status is of significant importance for auxin distribution in root meristems and for environmentally controlled adaptations of root growth. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence indicating that PIN 2 vacuolar sorting depends on modification specifically by lysine 63 -linked ubiquitin chains. Collectively, our results establish lysine 63 -linked PM cargo ubiquitylation as a regulator of polar auxin transport and adaptive growth responses in higher plants...|$|R
50|$|The final {{match was}} a Triple threat {{match for the}} WWE Championship between John Cena, Triple H and Shawn Michaels. In a show of solidarity, Triple H and Michaels entered {{together}} as D-Generation X. Right after the match began, Michaels executed Sweet Chin Music on Triple H, sending him outside the ring for several minutes. During this time Michaels fought Cena ably until he attempted to send Cena through the broadcast table. At this point Cena reversed but {{was interrupted by a}} recovered Triple H. But, instead of saving Michaels, he put him through a broadcast table with a Spinebuster. Triple H then took command of the match and continued to fight Cena. Cena's attempt at an Attitude Adjustment left him open to an attack by Shawn Michaels, who had revived from going through the table. Michaels and Triple H then battled one another for a period. Cena revived but was only met with a flying forearm smash from Michaels after missing a diving leg drop, who was promptly tossed outside by Triple H. Cena applied his signature submission, the STF, to Triple H but Michaels intervened and applied a crossface to break the hold. Eventually Cena was able to put Shawn Michaels in the STF but Michaels forced a rope break. While recovering from the STF, Michaels executed Sweet Chin Music on Cena and Triple H, causing Triple H to collapse onto Cena in a pinning predicament. After this a short burst of offense from Michaels and Triple H allowed Cena to get the final advantage, finishing the match by throwing Michaels onto Triple H with the Attitude <b>Adjustment</b> and <b>pinning</b> Triple H to retain the title.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Full mouth {{rehabilitation}} {{involving an}} increase in vertical dimension of occlusion presents lacunae in accurate and definite transfer of diagnosed and verified vertical dimension of occlusion, biologically compatible with the stomatognathic system. Currently, vertical dimension to be incorporated within the restorations is done arbitrarily by <b>adjustment</b> of vertical <b>pin</b> of articulators in the laboratory, which is graduated in difference of a minimum of 1 mm. This article describes an innovative and extended use of a diagnostic occlusal splint to overcome the lacunae. The technique utilizes the diagnostic occlusal splint to transfer vertical dimensions at various stages of mounting of working casts thereby incorporating the clinically verified vertical dimensions in the final prosthesis. The technique involves splitting the diagnostic occlusal splint into anterior and posterior half. On the posterior half further centric relation records are then made. At {{the same time the}} technique described eliminates errors incorporated as a result of frequent use of face bow index record and/or arbitrary adjustment of the articulator as well as the difference between clinical determination of vertical dimension and the arbitrary laboratory adjustment on th...|$|R
40|$|The {{flux line}} lattice in superconducting single {{crystals}} of YBa [subscript] 2 Cu[subscript] 3 O[subscript] 7 -[delta] {{is shown to}} undergo a very abrupt melting transition as the temperature and field approach the normal state. The sharpest transitions from the vortex solid to liquid phase, as seen in resistivity measurements, are {{of the order of}} 10 mK in a temperature of 85 K and of the order of 10 Oe in a field of 6 T. The discontinuity in the resistivity associated with vortex lattice melting is asymmetrically hysteretic with applied field in clean crystals. The melting transition width for decreasing applied magnetic field through the melting field H[subscript]m is only 10 Oe, much sharper than for increasing the field through H[subscript]m, about 300 Oe, at fixed temperature. For moderately defect-free crystals and for high current densities in cleaner crystals, the hysteresis becomes symmetric and broader. In samples with moderate amounts of disorder the vortex melting transition width is typically wider. Resistive measurements show hysteresis with applied field upon ramping the magnetic field partially through the melting transition. The resistivity data indicate a first order vortex lattice melting transition in low defect density crystals. At fixed field and temperature, the V-I character changes from ohmic to non-ohmic as the chosen temperature crosses the melting temperature T[subscript]m. Further evidence of flux line lattice melting is a peak in a critical current J[subscript]c seen just below the melting transition. A maximum in the optimization of the lattice softening and of the lattice <b>adjustments</b> to <b>pinning</b> sites occurs at the peak in J[subscript]c. Induced point defects from electron irradiation smears out the first order melting transition. The sharp melting discontinuity becomes a continuous curve without any non-ohmic behavior. The resistivity data taken in the vortex liquid state shows indications of being viscous. The indications of a first order melting transition are returned by subsequent annealing of the irradiated sample. Further work on the exact nature of the vortex viscosity in the vortex liquid state and experiments to study the plastic and elastic behavior of the vortex solid state should be considered...|$|R
