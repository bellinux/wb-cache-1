In Glasgow, the Currans, {{together}} with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>friends,</b> set up the Scottish Society for the Parents of Mentally Handicapped Children (Enable), which eventually grew to 100 branches and more than 5000 members. Later, when Joan {{was a member of}} the Greater Glasgow Health Board and the Scottish Special Housing Association, the needs of the disabled were always at the forefront of her mind, and she did much to promote their welfare. She took a close interest in the work of the Council for Access for the Disabled and helped improve the range of facilities, especially for disabled university students.|$|E

25|$|He {{visited the}} United States briefly in 1947 but became a Mexican citizen in 1956. His next {{appearance}} in the U.S. was in San Francisco for the New Music America festival in 1981. He traveled regularly in the following years. Consequently, he continued living in Las Águilas, Mexico City, until his death at age 84. Though he had <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>friends</b> among Mexican composers, he was largely unknown by the Mexican musical establishment.|$|E

25|$|The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley is an {{unfinished}} posthumous {{biography of the}} Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley that was written by his friend Thomas Jefferson Hogg. The first {{two of the four}} planned volumes were released in 1858 to largely unfavourable reviews. Though <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>friends</b> of Percy Shelley enjoyed the book, many critics attacked the book for being poorly edited and for portraying Shelley negatively. Though more volumes were planned, they were never published because of the Shelley family's objections to Hogg's treatment of him.|$|E
25|$|Before Alta California {{became a}} part of the Mexican state, about 30 Spanish land grants had already been deeded in all of Alta California to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>friends</b> and family of the Alta California Governors. The 1824 Mexican Colony Law {{established}} rules for petitioning for land grants in California; and by 1828, the rules for establishing land grants were codified in the Mexican Reglamento (Regulation). The Acts sought to break the monopoly of the Franciscan missions, while paving the way for additional settlers to California by making land grants easier to obtain.|$|E

25|$|In March 1943, it {{was found}} that he had cancer of the ear. Zou {{returned}} to Shanghai, where he continued to write in support of the United Front, promote establishment of democratic government, and urge expansion of mass education. As death grew near, he gathered his family and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>friends</b> to share his political testament. He wrote that he had three wishes: that his body be dissected at a hospital; that it then be cremated and the ashes sent to Yan'an, the wartime communist headquarters; and that he be made a member of the Party. He died July 24, 1944, and was granted party membership September 28.|$|E
25|$|Valentino {{first met}} Winifred Shaughnessy, known by her stage name, Natacha Rambova—an American silent film costume and set designer, art director, and protégée of Nazimova—on {{the set of}} Uncharted Seas in 1921. The two worked {{together}} on the Nazimova production of Camille, by which time they were romantically involved. They married on May 13, 1922, in Mexicali, Mexico, which resulted in Valentino's arrest for bigamy, since {{he had not been}} divorced for a full year, as required by California law at the time. Days passed and his studio at the time, Famous Players-Lasky, refused to post bail. Eventually, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>friends</b> were able to post the cash bail. He was also investigated for a possible violation of the Mann Act.|$|E
25|$|Drudge {{was unknown}} {{before he began}} the news {{aggregation}} site, the Drudge Report. For many years, he took odd jobs such as night counterman at a 7-Eleven convenience store, telemarketer for Time-Life books, McDonald's manager, and sales assistant at a New York City grocery store. In 1989, he moved to Los Angeles, where he took up residence in a small Hollywood apartment. He took {{a job in the}} gift shop of CBS studios, eventually working his way up to manager. Here, he was apparently privy to some inside gossip, part of the inspiration for founding the Drudge Report. Worried about his son’s aimlessness, Drudge's father insisted on buying him a Packard Bell computer in 1994. The Drudge Report began as e-Mail notes sent out to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>friends.</b>|$|E

25|$|Michael has {{brown eyes}} and thick, dark hair and is tall. He is {{extremely}} handsome, nice, funny, smart, and manly, despite staying cooped up writing songs or on his computer the whole day. Michael is romantic and talented. Though he often clashes with his younger sister, Michael and Lilly are in fact close siblings and friends. He used to have his own webzine called Crackhead but had to disband it after an editorial that stated the merits of Linux over Windows, which caused a loss in advertisers and funds. Shortly after this, Michael decided to start a band called Skinner Box (name suggested by Mia), which refers to an experiment by the behavioural psychologist B. F. Skinner into proving {{the existence of a}} 'conditioned response', {{with the use of a}} specially designed box that held animals (such as rats and monkeys, in the experiment) until release, which could only be activated by pressing a lever. He started it with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>friends,</b> including Boris Pelkowski.|$|E
25|$|Columbus made {{a fourth}} voyage, {{nominally}} {{in search of}} a westward passage to the Indian Ocean. Accompanied by his stepbrother Bartolomeo, Diego Mendez, and his son Fernando, he left Cádiz, Spain on May 12, 1502, with his flagship, Capitana, as well as the Gallega, Vizcaína, and Santiago de Palos. He sailed to Arzila on the Moroccan coast to rescue the Portuguese soldiers who he heard were under siege by the Moors. On June 15, 1502, they landed at Carbet on the island of Martinique (Martinica). A hurricane was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on Hispaniola. He arrived at Santo Domingo on June 29, 1502, but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus's ships sheltered {{at the mouth of the}} Jaina River, the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. The only ship to reach Spain had Columbus's money and belongings on it, and all of his former enemies (and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>friends)</b> had drowned, including Francisco de Bobadilla, who'd had Columbus sent back to Spain in chains two years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Henzell also shot some footage {{for what}} was planned as his next film, No Place Like Home, in Harder's aftermath, but he went broke before he could finish the film. Fed up by this, {{and the lack of}} finance for further production, he {{went on to become a}} writer, {{publishing}} his first novel, Power Game, in 1982. Both were meant to complete a planned trilogy of films centring on Ivanhoe Martin. The footage for No Place Like Home was lost. Years later, he came across editing tapes in a lab in New York. Just to have a sense of completion, he worked on the project. When he showed it to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>friends,</b> their response was enthusiastic. He eventually was able to retrieve the original footage. No Place Like Home was screened for the public at the 31st annual Toronto International Film Festival in September 2006 at the Cumberland Theatre; it was sold out. Film leads Carl Bradshaw (The Harder They Come, Smile Orange, Countryman) and Susan O'Meara attended and answered audience questions with Henzell after the screening. The film was scheduled to be screened at the Flashpoint Film Festival at the beginning of December 2006 in Negril.|$|E

25|$|Is {{there anybody}} {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, {{who had the}} opportunities which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations will never know, and the privilege to enjoy them with such wonderful friends? I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>friends</b> who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E
25|$|A {{great number}} of {{pamphlets}} were issued by both sides, in which the contestants indulged in the most vehement abuse of each other. On 23 July 1713, Ashkenazi placed Chayun under the ban, because the investigating committee appointed by the Sephardic directorate had not yet made its report. In consequence of this measure, both Ashkenazi and Chagiz were subjected to street attacks, more particularly {{at the hands of}} the Portuguese, who threatened to kill them. In the midst of the constantly increasing bitterness and animosity, the report of the committee, which had been prepared by Ayllon alone, was publicly announced. It was to the effect that the writings of Chayun contained nothing which could be construed as offensive to Judaism. It was publicly announced in the synagogue that Chayun was to be exonerated from every suspicion of heresy, and on the following day a public reception was tendered him at the synagogue, on which occasion unparalleled honor was shown him. Naturally, the Sephardic opponents of Ashkenazi had found excellent support among the rabbi's adversaries in his own German congregation. The controversy was now waged so fiercely that even the family-life of the community became affected, and all peace vanished from the otherwise model congregation of Amsterdam. Ashkenazi was deserted, except for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>friends</b> that remained faithful to him. When, finally, he was summoned by the directors of the Portuguese congregation to appear before their tribunal—which, of course, had no jurisdiction—he refused to do so, as he anticipated that he would be asked to retract and to praise and recommend Chayun.|$|E
