30|$|In the {{dip-coating}} process presented here, the polarity {{difference between}} PDMS and SiO 2 regions can induce selective localization of SWCNTs along the strip direction. Specifically, {{when such a}} surface is drawn vertically from the SWCNTs solution, a thin meniscus is formed selectively on the hydrophilic SiO 2 substrate at the three phase contact line (solid–liquid–vapor interface) with a contact angle θ (Fig.  1 b). As the pulling velocity is sufficiently slow, the solvent starts to evaporate mostly from the pattern edges, leading to convective transport of the SWCNTs {{that is similar to}} the well-known coffee-ring flow [31]. In addition, the confined geometry of a topographically patterned surface strongly influences the direction of evaporation, so that the liquid layer dries and forms <b>aligned</b> <b>bundles</b> of SWCNTs along the nano-strips [32]. This directional evaporation significantly enhances align accuracy and pattern fidelity as compared to other solution-based methods (e.g., spin-coating, dipping).

40|$|Abstract. The thermal {{properties}} of carbon nanotubes are di-rectly {{related to their}} unique structure and small size. Because of these properties, nanotubes {{may prove to be}} an ideal mate-rial for the study of low-dimensional phonon physics, and for thermal management, both on the macro- and the micro-scale. We have begun to explore the {{thermal properties}} of nano-tubes by measuring the specific heat and thermal conductivity of bulk SWNT samples. In addition, we have synthesized nanotube-based composite materials and measured their ther-mal conductivity. The measured specific heat of single-walled nanotubes differs from that of both 2 D graphene and 3 D graphite, es-pecially at low temperatures, where 1 D quantization of the phonon bandstructure is observed. The measured specific heat shows only weak effects of intertube coupling in nanotube bundling, suggesting that this coupling is weaker than ex-pected. The thermal conductivity of nanotubes is large, even in bulk samples: <b>aligned</b> <b>bundles</b> of SWNTs show a thermal conductivity of> 200 W/m K at room temperature. A linear K(T) up to approximately 40 K may be due to 1 D quantiza-tion; measurement of K(T) of samples with different average nanotube diameters supports this interpretation.

40|$|Yeast prions {{constitute}} a “protein-only” mechanism of inheritance that is widely deployed by wild yeast to create diverse phenotypes. One of the best-characterized prions, [PSI+], {{is governed by}} a conformational change in the prion domain of Sup 35, a translation-termination factor. When this domain switches from its normal soluble form to an insoluble amyloid, the ensuing change in protein synthesis creates new traits. Two factors make these traits heritable: (i) the amyloid conformation is self-templating; and (ii) the protein-remodeling factor heat-shock protein (Hsp) 104 (acting together with Hsp 70 chaperones) partitions the template to daughter cells with high fidelity. Prions formed by several other yeast proteins create their own phenotypes but share the same mechanistic basis of inheritance. Except for the amyloid fibril itself, the cellular architecture underlying these protein-based elements of inheritance is unknown. To study the 3 D arrangement of prion assemblies in their cellular context, we examined yeast [PSI+] prions in the native, hydrated state in situ, taking advantage of recently developed methods for cryosectioning of vitrified cells. Cryo–electron tomography of the vitrified sections revealed the prion assemblies as <b>aligned</b> <b>bundles</b> of regularly spaced fibrils in the cytoplasm with no bounding structures. Although the fibers were widely spaced, other cellular complexes, such as ribosomes, {{were excluded from the}} fibril arrays.

40|$|High-density carbon {{nanotube}} networks (CNNs) continue to attract interest as active elements in nanoelectronic devices, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and multifunctional nanocomposites. The interplay between the network nanostructure and the its properties is crucial, yet current understanding remains {{limited to the}} passive response. Here, we employ a novel superstructure consisting of millimeter-long vertically aligned singe walled {{carbon nanotube}}s (SWCNTs) sandwiched between polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layers to quantify the effect of two classes of mechanical stimuli, film densification and stretching, on the electronic and thermal transport across the network. The network deforms easily with increase in electrical and thermal conductivities suggestive of floppy yet highly reconfigurable network. Insight from atomistically informed coarse-grained simulations uncover an interplay between the extent of lateral assembly of the bundles, modulated by surface zipping/unzipping, and the elastic energy associated with the bent conformations of the nanotubes/bundles. During densification, the network becomes highly interconnected yet we observe a modest increase in bundling primarily due to the reduced spacing between the SWCNTs. The stretching, on the other hand, is characterized by an initial debundling regime as the strain accommodation occurs via unzipping of the branched interconnects, followed by rapid re-bundling as the strain transfers to the increasingly <b>aligned</b> <b>bundles.</b> In both cases, {{the increase in the}} electrical and thermal conductivity is primarily due to the increase in bundle size; the changes in network connectivity have a minor effect on the transport.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a kinetic model for alignment of cells or fila-ments with probabilistic turning. For this equation existence of solutions is known, see [2]. To understand its qualitative behavior, especially {{with respect to}} the selection of orientations and mass distributions for long times, the model is approximated by a diffusion equation in the limit of small deviations of the interactions between the cell bundles. For this new equation existence of steady states is shown. In contrast to the kinetic equation discussed in [2] with deterministic turning, where local stability of two opposite orientations was shown but no selection of mass could be observed, for the new approximating problem with probabilistic turning additionally mass selection takes place. In the limit of small diffusion, steady states can only be constructed, if the aligning masses are either equal or the total mass is concentrated in one direction. By numerical simulations we tested stability of these steady states and for situations with 4 symmetrically placed smooth distributions of alignment. Conver-gence of the numerical code was proved. The simulations suggest, that only the 2 - and the 1 -peak steady states can be stable, whereas the 4 peak steady state is always unstable. We conjecture that the noise in the system is responsible for this final selection of masses.

Nanowires of gold and other metals have been produced in the capillaries of the single-walled nanotubes...|$|R
