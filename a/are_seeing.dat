5|$|A {{feature-length film}} that {{indirectly}} parodies Star Trek is Galaxy Quest. This film {{is based on}} the premise that aliens monitoring the broadcast of an Earth-based TV series called Galaxy Quest, modeled heavily on Star Trek, believe that what they <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> is real. Many Star Trek actors have been quoted saying that Galaxy Quest was a brilliant parody.|$|E
5|$|Scientists <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> {{far greater}} {{variability}} in the prototypes than previously believed. The increasing divergence in the masses of the world's prototypes and the short-term instability in the IPK has prompted research into improved methods to obtain a smooth surface finish using diamond turning on newly manufactured replicas and has intensified {{the search for a}} new definition of the kilogram. See Proposed future definitions, below.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Audrina rejects {{an invitation}} to Frankie's birthday party when she realizes that Kristin will be in attendance. Lo and Stephanie are shocked that Justin tells Kristin that he and Audrina were not officially a couple, but decide against confronting Kristin.

De Lauretis also notes the ambiguity inherent in the title: is she imagining things, {{or is it that}} she must <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> things [...] - [...] are there things that she ought to <b>be</b> <b>seeing?</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Basingstoke's {{expansion}} has absorbed much surrounding farmland {{and scattered}} housing, transforming it into housing estates or local districts. Many {{of these new}} estates are designed as almost self-contained communities, such as Lychpit, Chineham, Popley, Winklebury, Oakridge, Kempshott, Brighton Hill, Viables, South Ham, Black Dam, Buckskin and Hatch Warren. The M3 acts as a buffer zone {{to the south of}} the town, and the South Western Main Line constrains the western expansion, with a green belt to the north and north-east, making Basingstoke shaped almost like a kite. As a result, the villages of Cliddesden, Dummer, Sherborne St John and Oakley, although being very close to the town limits, are considered distinct entities. Popley, Hatch Warren and Beggarwood <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> rapid growth in housing.|$|E
5|$|Even though Lana {{eventually}} marries Lex {{in season}} six, Al Gough argues that Lana still loved Clark and Clark still loved her. The only reason Lana was with Lex was because Clark forced {{her in that}} direction and she ended up getting in over her head. By contrast, writer Caroline Dries feels that Lana did love Lex, and {{that she did not}} make any hasty decisions when she agreed to marry him. Dries believes that the progression of the show demonstrates that Lex earned Lana's love. To answer viewers that hated to see Lana marry Lex, Dries contends that as viewers we <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> all of Lex, including how evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex that appears good.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies {{about why they}} are not going out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob to watch what happens in the wings during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as {{more and more of the}} dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E

They soon develop a relationship, with Sun wanting {{to run away}} with Jin to America, but Jin insisting they honorably tell her father that they <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> each other. Sun's father approves of their relationship as long as Jin takes a job working for him. One night after they're married, Jin returns home covered in someone else's blood. Sun is angry that he refuses to explain the blood to her and slaps him. He tells Sun that he does whatever her father tells him to do. A few years later, Sun secretly plots to leave Jin and her father, so she will be free to go wherever she wants. However, she does not go through with her plans after he expresses a loving gesture to her, and boards Flight 815 with her husband.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to test the thesis that people employ sensory-motor conceptual metaphors to understand metaphorical expressions. Congenitally blind and sighted participants paraphrased metaphorical expressions derived from the UNDERSTANDING is GRASPING and UNDERSTANDING <b>is</b> <b>SEEING</b> conceptual metaphors, and evaluated to what extent they felt they had understood them. On the one hand, congenitally blind participants did not comprehend better UNDERSTANDING is GRASPING expressions than UNDERSTANDING <b>is</b> <b>SEEING</b> expressions. On the other hand, sighted participants did not comprehend UNDERSTANDING <b>is</b> <b>SEEING</b> expressions better than the blind.

25|$|Some {{potentially}} vulnerable {{states that}} have not yet seen such protests have taken a variety of preemptive measures to avoid such displays occurring in their own countries; some of these states and others have experienced political fallout {{as a result of their}} own governmental actions and reactions to events which their own citizens <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> reported from abroad.|$|E
25|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{concerning the}} origin of the Ertebølle population are therefore possible and have been proposed. One is that in the remains we <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> an intermediate phase {{in the evolution of the}} Nordics. The second is that the Ertebølle population were an admixture of agrarian southerners with indigenous Cro-magnons over a permeable border. Both views are supported by the evidence.|$|E
25|$|For his 2011 {{exhibition}} of drawings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Serra reworked {{some of his}} earlier pieces on paper which had been damaged or destroyed, recreating them specifically for the show. The museum labeled the works with two dates: that of the original {{and that of the}} reworked version. According to Serra, however, it is not important whether audiences know which version they <b>are</b> <b>seeing.</b>|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 20th century, the state grew quickly. In the 1970s, growth was phenomenal in the suburbs. Sandy {{was one of}} the {{fastest-growing}} cities in the country at that time, and West Valley City is the state's 2nd most populous city. Today, many areas of Utah <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> phenomenal growth.

Transportation and urbanization are major issues in politics as development consumes agricultural land and wilderness areas.|$|E
25|$|Newspapers in {{countries}} with {{easy access to the}} web have been hurt by the decline of many traditional advertisers.
