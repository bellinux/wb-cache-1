50|$|Black {{people were}} {{the subject of}} 14.8 percent of all stop <b>and</b> <b>searches,</b> {{compared}} to 7.6 percent of arrests and 6.7 percent of cautions. The disproportionate number of stop <b>and</b> <b>searches</b> is partly {{accounted for by the}} fact that 54 percent of the black population in England and Wales live in London, where stop <b>and</b> <b>searches</b> are more common for all ethnic groups. In some police-force areas, there were more stop <b>and</b> <b>searches</b> per head of population of white people than of black people. From 2004/05 to 2008/09, there was {{an increase in the number}} of stop <b>and</b> <b>searches</b> of black people relative to white people.|$|R

5|$|The Renaissance was a {{cultural}} movement that profoundly affected European intellectual {{life in the}} early modern period.

5|$|At dawn on 31 October 1991, the {{squadron}} sailed out of Dubrovnik {{to meet the}} Libertas convoya fleet of civilian vessels, the largest among them being the Jadrolinija shipping line's Slavija, which was endeavoring to deliver humanitarian aid to the city under siege. The fleet sailed from Rijeka and made several port calls, growing to 29 vessels as it approached Dubrovnik. The convoy, accompanied by the last President of Yugoslavia Stjepan Mesić and the Prime Minister of Croatia Franjo Gregurić, was stopped <b>and</b> <b>searched</b> by the Yugoslav Navy off the island of Mljet before {{the squadron}} linked up with the convoy and escorted it to Dubrovnik.

5|$|The {{result of}} this {{certainty}} was that the investigation was poorly conducted. The crime scene was not secured <b>and</b> <b>searched</b> thoroughly, and evidence was not recorded or preserved. Within a couple of days, the police had burned the bloodstained bedding and carpets, apparently to spare Bamber's feelings. The scenes-of-crime officer moved the murder weapon without wearing gloves, {{and it was not}} examined for fingerprints until weeks later. Three days after the killings, Bamber and the extended family were given back the keys to the house.|$|E
5|$|Tyler and the Kentish men {{advanced}} to Canterbury, entering the walled city and castle without resistance on 10 June. The rebels deposed the absent Archbishop of Canterbury, Sudbury, {{and made the}} cathedral monks swear loyalty to their cause. They attacked properties in the city with links to the hated royal council, <b>and</b> <b>searched</b> the city for suspected enemies, dragging the suspects {{out of their houses}} and executing them. The city gaol was opened and the prisoners freed. Tyler then persuaded a few thousand of the rebels to leave Canterbury and advance with him on London the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Various Taliban {{supplies}} were seized by coalition forces following the battle. On 13 December, British and Afghan army units located bomb factories and weapons caches {{as they moved}} further into the outskirts of Musa Qala <b>and</b> <b>searched</b> Taliban positions.

A new orientation of British strategy in Helmand is to use military force to curb the influence of local drug barons, whose trade supports the insurgents. On 16 December, British troops burned an estimated £150 to £200 million worth of heroin that had been found in a drug factory and other buildings in Musa Qala.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the era of}} {{knowledge}} economy, firms need to search outside to obtain strategic and complementary resources to innovate. However, existing research on open innovation mainly focuses on local knowledge <b>search</b> <b>and</b> ignores {{to answer the question}} that how firms search outside firm boundary. Based on the attention theory, we divide external knowledge search process into two parts, namely <b>search</b> selection <b>and</b> <b>search</b> intensity. This paper examines how international knowledge <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>search</b> intensity help enhance innovation performance in China’s emerging economy. The result shows that international knowledge <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>search</b> intensity both are positively related to innovation performance, <b>and</b> <b>search</b> intensity positively moderates the relationship between international knowledge <b>search</b> <b>and</b> innovation performance. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Another man {{is found}} dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his {{apartment}}. Evidence {{in his apartment}} points {{to the construction of}} a bomb, and the Fringe team suspects that Dana knows its location and may be hoping to exploit an event which will kill several people simultaneously in order to increase her own chances of death. Peter calls her, using caller ID spoofing to disguise his number as that of her late husband, and the signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a commuter train. The train is stopped <b>and</b> <b>searched,</b> while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, moving it far enough away from the train. The bomb soon explodes, and when Peter and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally dead, and the only fatality from the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Becket excommunicated both de Brocs {{again on}} Christmas Day, 1170. On 28 December 1170, de Broc {{received}} at Saltwood Castle four knights– William de Tracy, Reginald fitzUrse, Hugh de Morville, and Richard le Breton– {{who had arrived}} from the continent. The five men conceived a plan to surround Canterbury Cathedral and force Becket to rescind his excommunications. On 29 December 1170, the five men arrived at Canterbury, where it appears that de Broc {{was in charge of}} the soldiers surrounding the cathedral while the other four went inside to negotiate with the archbishop. The four did not succeed in persuading the archbishop and the situation degenerated into the four men murdering Becket at one of the altars of the cathedral. After this, the four rejoined de Broc <b>and</b> <b>searched</b> the archiepiscopal residence for papers and other documents that de Broc was to send to the king. The party then returned to Saltwood.|$|E
5|$|Braham and Walsh {{scrambled}} {{free of the}} Mosquito and {{hid behind}} a sand dune. As they did so the aircraft's fuel tanks exploded. The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet {{and for a moment}} they believed he was going to fire upon them. To their relief he waved and flew by. They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them. They were captured <b>and</b> <b>searched.</b> The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing the gun, fighting it out with the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E

5|$|Celestial bodies {{interior}} to {{the orbit}} of Mercury have been hypothesized, <b>and</b> <b>searched</b> for, for centuries. The German astronomer Christoph Scheiner thought he had seen small bodies passing {{in front of the}} Sun in 1611, but these were later shown to be sunspots. In the 1850s, Urbain Le Verrier made detailed calculations of Mercury's orbit and found a small discrepancy in the planet's perihelion precession from predicted values. He postulated that the gravitational influence of a small planet or ring of asteroids within {{the orbit of}} Mercury would explain the deviation. Shortly afterward, an amateur astronomer named Edmond Lescarbault claimed to have seen Le Verrier's proposed planet transit the Sun. The new planet was quickly named Vulcan but was never seen again, and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury's orbit was explained by Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915. The vulcanoids take their name from this hypothetical planet. What Lescarbault saw was probably another sunspot.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the city's {{population}} {{increased with}} the arrival of new businesses and industries that offered additional employment opportunities, spurred real estate development, and ushered {{in the beginning of the}} city's urban, industrial development. In addition, street crime was prevalent, causing the city government to increase its police force and local merchants to hire private security. The era was also a time of bitter political disputes between Indiana's Democrats and Republicans. In May 1863, in an incident sarcastically called the Battle of Pogue's Run, Union soldiers stopped <b>and</b> <b>searched</b> two departing trainloads of delegates to a statewide Democratic convention, many of whom tossed their personal weapons into a nearby creek. In July 1863 Indianapolis residents feared an attack from Confederate forces during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana, but the Confederates turned east toward Ohio and never came to the city.|$|E
5|$|Following the raids, {{tensions}} {{were high}} {{in the streets of}} the cities. Police were ordered to shoot those who defied the 21:00 to 05:00 curfew, and troops in full camouflage battle dress guarded every major intersection and bridge with automatic weapons bearing fixed bayonets. The empty pagodas were ringed by troops and armored cars. All outgoing news was censored, forcing reporters to smuggle their copy out with travelers flying to foreign countries. The telephone lines in the homes and offices of all U.S. military and embassy staff were disconnected. The head of the USAID mission, Joe Brant, was stopped <b>and</b> <b>searched</b> while commuting to work, and other American officials had their meetings with Vietnamese officials and applications for permits to travel after the curfew hours delayed. The 14,000 U.S. military advisers in the country were given orders to stay in their homes, and all leave was canceled.|$|E
