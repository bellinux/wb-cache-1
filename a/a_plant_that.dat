5|$|A {{trap crop}} is {{a crop of}} <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E
5|$|Banksia sceptrum, {{commonly}} known as the sceptre banksia, is <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> grows in Western Australia near the central west coast from Geraldton north through Kalbarri to Hamelin Pool. It extends inland almost to Mullewa. First collected and grown by early settler James Drummond in Western Australia, it was described by Swiss botanist Carl Meissner in 1855.|$|E
5|$|Grow Home is an {{adventure}} platform video game developed by Ubisoft Reflections {{and published by}} Ubisoft. It was released for Microsoft Windows on February 4, 2015, and for PlayStation 4 on September 1, 2015. The game follows a robot named B.U.D., who is tasked with growing <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> will oxygenate its home planet. Players explore an open world, moving B.U.D. and individually using each of its arms to climb and interact with objects.|$|E
50|$|The {{transmission}} of plant viruses {{has been studied}} using grafting. Virus indexing involves grafting <b>a</b> symptomless <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> is suspected of carrying a virus onto <b>an</b> indicator <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> is very susceptible to the virus.|$|R
50|$|Stylidium ecorne is <b>a</b> {{dicotyledonous}} <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> {{belongs to}} the genus Stylidium (family Stylidiaceae). It is <b>an</b> annual <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> grows from 5 to 12 cm tall. It has pale or bright pink flowers and occurs in swampy areas.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to being the primary energy source for plants, light functions as a signalling device, providing information to the plant, such as how much sunlight the plant receives each day. This can result in adaptive changes in {{a process known as}} photomorphogenesis. Phytochromes are the photoreceptors in <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> are sensitive to light.|$|E
5|$|According to the ethnobiologists Smith-Hall, Larsen and Pouliotof, a {{medicinal}} plant is <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> {{is used to}} attempt to maintain health, to be administered for a specific condition, or both, whether in modern medicine or in traditional medicine. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in 2002 that over 50,000 {{medicinal plant}}s are used across the world. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew more conservatively estimated in 2016 that 17,810 plant species have a medicinal use, out of some 30,000 plants for which a use of any kind is documented.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} the {{horticulture}} industry focussed on registered selections of Banksia spinulosa, {{but since the}} late 1990s more and more cultivars of Banksia ericifolia have come on the market, including colour variants and dwarf forms. The latter are particularly attractive as the original plant may reach 6metres in height, and the new cultivars help enthusiasts choose <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> is right for their conditions and tastes. Banksia ericifolia is also grown for the cut flower industry in Australia, though not {{to the degree that}} the western Australian species such as B.coccinea and B.menziesii are.|$|E

5|$|The lack of old native {{names for}} {{it has been}} used to {{demonstrate}} its absence in Britain before introduction in around 1487, but this is challenged by the presence of an old Scottish Gaelic name for the tree, fior chrann which suggests a longer presence in Scotland at least {{as far back as the}} Gaelic settlement at Dál Riata in the late 6th and early 7th centuries. This would make it either an archaeophyte (a naturalised tree introduced by humans before 1500) or perhaps native if it can be seen to have reached Scotland without human intervention. At the moment it is usually classified as a neophyte, <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> is naturalised but arrived with humans on or after the year 1500. Today, the sycamore is present in 3,461 (89.7%) of hectads in Britain, more than any native tree species.|$|E

25|$|Invasive {{species have}} become a concern in some areas. Some of these include yellow starthistle and scotch broom. Starthistle has become {{a problem in the}} Siskiyous only in the last 20 years. It has little value to habitat and is able to outcompete many native plants. Purple loosestrife is <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> is {{invasive}} to waterways.|$|E

25|$|In August 1988, Davis {{began work}} as a drill {{technician}} at <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> manufactured railroad crossing gates. His boss commented that while Davis was a likeable and good worker who appeared to have positive life goals, his job attendance was poor; by Christmas 1988, he had stopped coming to work. Davis returned to the job twice in the following months but neither time remained for long.|$|E
25|$|In {{agriculture}} and horticulture pollination management, a good pollenizer is <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> provides compatible, viable and plentiful pollen and blooms {{at the same}} time as the plant that is to be pollinated or has pollen that can be stored and used when needed to pollinate the desired flowers. Hybridization is effective pollination between flowers of different species, or between different breeding lines or populations. see also Heterosis.|$|E
25|$|As <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> is {{reported}} to be both poisonous for human ingestion and also medicinal; much of the contradiction can be found by closely reviewing the words that are used and the dose (amount) of the poisonous substance that is ingested to prove either claim. All species of the genus Senecio contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids (e.g., senecionine) a substance that when a human has chronic exposure can cause irreversible liver damage.|$|E

25|$|In {{a habitat}} with {{abundant}} soil nutrients but little light (as shown above), the gross photosynthesis curve will be lower and flatter, because light {{will be more}} limiting than nutrients. A plant can grow at zero investment in carnivory; {{this is also the}} optimum investment for a plant, as any investment in traps reduces net photosynthesis (growth) to less than the net photosynthesis of <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> obtains its nutrients from soil alone.|$|E
25|$|In {{vascular}} plants, {{the root}} is the organ of <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> typically lies {{below the surface}} of the soil. Roots can also be aerial or aerating, that is growing up above the ground or especially above water. Furthermore, a stem normally occurring below ground is not exceptional either (see rhizome). Therefore, the root is best defined as the non-leaf, non-nodes bearing parts of the plant's body. However, important internal structural differences between stems and roots exist.|$|E
25|$|After the Restoration of Independence in 1640, {{in order}} to recover the ailing Portuguese naval fleet, were {{encouraged}} its cultivation as the Royal Decree of D. John IV in 1656.

25|$|An {{extensively}} documented case of coevolution is {{the relationship}} between Pseudomyrmex, a type of ant, and the acacia, <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> the ant uses for food and shelter. The relationship between the two is so intimate that it has led to the evolution of special structures and behaviors in both organisms. The ant defends the acacia against herbivores and clears the forest floor of the seeds from competing plants. In response, the plant has evolved swollen thorns that the ants use as shelter and special flower parts that the ants eat.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, President Woodrow Wilson {{asked the}} Intercontinental Rubber Company—owned by Bernard Baruch, J. P. Morgan and Kennedy—to grow guayule. Guayule is <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> {{produces}} latex {{that can be}} used to make rubber. Many feared the German navy might blockade rubber shipments from Asia. As a result, Intercontinental established the Continental Farm and the little town of Continental in southeastern Arizona in 1916. The guayule growing operations didn't last and in 1922 the Continental Farm was sold to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who rented the fields to cotton farmers for several years.|$|E
25|$|M. flavitarsis wasps also locate prey by smell. In one study, holes {{were made}} in a leaf and placed near <b>a</b> <b>plant</b> <b>that</b> had holes made in its leaves twelve days prior. Once {{caterpillar}} larvae {{were placed on the}} leaf, the time for the wasp to locate the larvae was recorded. It was found that M. flavitarsis are more likely to approach the freshly damaged leaf, which release mechanical odors that serve as cues for the wasps. In studies, these wasps are more likely to approach a leaf based on olfactory cues, rather than visual cues. This shows that presented olfactory stimuli are processed before the wasp processes visual stimuli.|$|E
