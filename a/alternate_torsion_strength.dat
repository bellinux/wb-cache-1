The paper reports on investigations of adhesively bonded shrunk shaft-hub Joints under torsion and combined static or <b>alternating</b> <b>torsion</b> and rotating bending. Tests with torsion and combined static torsion and rotating bending mainly show {{failure of the}} adhesive layer, while <b>alternating</b> <b>torsion</b> and rotating bending predominantly causes fretting fatigue failures. The high-cycle fatigue strength is significantly decreased. Based on experimental results a normalized 3 -D-fatigue diagram is developed.

The objective of this experiments would be the role of transverse and longitudinal reinforcement on <b>torsion</b> <b>strength.</b> Four beam test samples has been tested with the same length and concrete mix design. Due to the fact, that the goal of this experiment is to determine the effect of reinforcement type on <b>torsion</b> <b>strength</b> of concrete beams; therefore, bars with different types in each beam have been applied. It was observed that the ductility factor increases with increasing percentage reinforcement from the test results. It should be also noted that transverse bars or longitudinal bars lonely would not able to increase the torsional strength of RC beams and both of them can be essential for having a good torsional behaviour in reinforced concrete beams. Introduction. The interest in gaining better understanding of the torsional behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) members has grown in the past decades. This {{may be due to the}} increasing use of structural members in which torsion is a central feature of behaviour such as curved bridge girders and helical slabs. The achievements, however, have not been as much as those made in the areas of shear and bending. Dealing with torsion in today's codes of practice is also very primitive and does not contain the more elaborate techniques.
