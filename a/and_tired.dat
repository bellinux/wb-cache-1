5|$|Harry Strom, a {{long time}} cabinet minister, {{replaced}} Manning and lead the party to defeat in the 1971 election {{at the hands of}} the Progressive Conservatives under Peter Lougheed.

5|$|It {{is clear}} that the demoralised <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> Greeks were no match for the Persians, and were {{completely}} routed in the battle which ensued at Ephesus. Many were killed, including the Eretrian general, Eualcides. The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships and sailed back to Greece.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter Myrrha {{walked in}} exile for nine months, past {{the palms of}} Arabia and the fields of Panchaea, until she reached Sabaea. Afraid of death <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> of life, and {{pregnant}} as well, she begged the gods for a solution, and was transformed into the myrrh tree, with the sap thereof representing her tears. Later, Lucina freed the newborn Adonis from the tree.|$|E

Hunted by the Pirate Guild for meddling in their criminal enterprises <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> {{of life on}} the run, Cobra surgically altered his face and had his memories erased. Lady Armaroid tells Cobra that the Trip Movie has triggered his subconscious to regain access to the memories of his former life. Cobra and Lady Armadroid resume their adventurous life together.|$|E
5|$|Pound was in Rome {{early in}} September when Italy surrendered. He {{borrowed}} {{a pair of}} hiking boots and a knapsack and left the city, having finally decided to tell Mary about his wife and son. Heading north, he spent a night in an air-raid shelter in Bologna, then took a train to Verona and walked {{the rest of the}} way; he apparently traveled over 450 miles in all. Mary almost failed to recognize him when he arrived, he was so dirty <b>and</b> <b>tired.</b> He told her everything about his other family; she later admitted she felt more pity than anger.|$|E
5|$|Van Eyck {{does not}} shy from showing the {{physical}} {{effects of the}} canon's illness, including worn, crevassed <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> skin, weak vision, enlarged temporal arteries and swollen fingers. The awkwardness with which van der Paele clutches his breviary suggests weakness in his left arm; van de Paele probably suffered acute arm and shoulder pain, borne out by early 1430s church records documenting that he was excused from morning duties, and absent all day by 1434. His condition has been diagnosed by modern doctors as possibly polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis.|$|E

5|$|Jon Snow, {{having just}} {{resigned}} from the Night's Watch, is disillusioned by the betrayal of his fellow Night's Watchmen <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> {{of all of the}} endless fighting. Jon states his intent to head south, but Edd is unhappy with Jon's decision after seeing what had happened at Hardhome. They are interrupted by the lookout's horn as Sansa Stark, Brienne of Tarth, and Podrick Payne arrive at Castle Black and Sansa is reunited with Jon. After telling each other their stories, Sansa tries to convince Jon to help her retake Winterfell. However, Jon is still reluctant to fight. Frustrated, Sansa declares to Jon that she will take back Winterfell whether he helps her or not.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact {{is reinforced by the}} clock placed on the table beside him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E
5|$|This {{force was}} then {{guided by the}} Ephesians through {{mountains}} to Sardis, Artaphernes's satrapal capital. The Greeks caught the Persians unawares, {{and were able to}} capture the lower city. However the lower city then caught fire, and the Greeks, demoralised, then retreated from the city, and began to make their way back to Ephesus. The Persians troops in Asia Minor followed the Greek force, catching them outside Ephesus. It is clear that the demoralised <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> Greeks were no match for the Persians, and were completely routed in the ensuing battle at Ephesus. The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships, and sailed back to Greece.|$|E

5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils {{of the world in}} the box, she placed her power of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E

25|$|In 1909, Modigliani {{returned}} home to Livorno, sickly <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> from his wild lifestyle. Soon {{he was back in}} Paris, this time renting a studio in Montparnasse. He originally saw himself as a sculptor rather than a painter, and was encouraged to continue after Paul Guillaume, an ambitious young art dealer, took an interest in his work and introduced him to sculptor Constantin Brâncuși. He was Constantin Brâncuși's disciple for one year.|$|E

His new show began the following Monday and ran until the mid-1980s. By 1986, Griffin was ready to retire and ended his talk show run. Thanks to profits from his highly successful game shows, Griffin had become one of the world's wealthiest entertainers.|$|E
