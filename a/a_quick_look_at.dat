40|$|This Chapter {{glances at}} the {{shifting}} landscape of disciplines and professions, with particular focus towards “Interior Design. ” In spite of trends and increasing examples of the erosion and overlapping of disciplinary and professional boundaries, ironically or not, there remains the need {{for some sort of}} de nition; in other words, {{there needs to be a}} body of knowledge and skills de ned and practiced. This is especially relevant in a world of inter-, multi-, and trans-disciplinary work and comprehensive creative practices. After <b>a</b> very <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> “Environmental Design” – or the design of environments and experiences – the paper spends a bit more time examining possible core aspects of Interior Design while promoting its expanded eld.

Additionally, the chapter explores the curricular use of intensive design workshops with a singular focus of the student’s attention; selected student work from Politecnico di Milano is included...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between historians and archives is generally taken for granted. But this impression is misleading. Across the world, {{the building of}} archival collections involves a complicated process of selection and destruction. Traditionally, historians do not really know how this process is being conducted and very often a good proportion of them believe that all documents should be kept. The evolution {{of history and the}} questioning of the archives by philosophers cannot be ignored and these have changed the {{relationship between}} historians and archives. However, the construction of tomorrow’s archives is happening right now, and historians should be prepared {{to find a way to}} participate in this operation. The role of archivists is central in the whole process. In the past, archivists generally received a basic training as historians, but since the 1950 s, they have been more and more involved with other disciplines like library or information sciences. They became professionals in a new discipline. Historians should take notice of this reality and be prepared to work with archivists on an equal footing. They must learn what archivists are doing and join them to help create archival collections for the future. The last part of the paper takes <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the evolution of the Internet as an addition, or rather than as an extension, of archival holdings. La relación de los historiadores con los archivos se considera segura, pero esta impresión confunde. En todo el mundo, la construcción de colecciones de archivo supone un complejo proceso de selección y destrucción. Los historiadores no suelen conocer este proceso, creyendo que todos los documentos se conservan. La evolución de la historiografía y el cuestionamiento de los archivos por los filósofos no se pueden ignorar, pues han cambiado la relación entre historiadores y archivos. Pero la construcción de archivos futuros sucede hoy, y los historiadores deben estar preparados para esa operación. El papel de los archiveros es central, antes solían recibir formación básica en historia, pero desde los años 1950 están cada vez más implicados con otras disciplinas, así biblioteconomía y ciencias de la información, formándose como profesionales en una nueva disciplina. Los historiadores deben conocer esta realidad y prepararse a trabajar con los archiveros en pie de igualdad, sabiendo lo que estos hacen, uniéndose a ellos para crear las futuras colecciones de archivo. En fin, se proporciona una mirada a la evolución de Internet como una adición, o mejor como una extensión de las riquezas de los archivos...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the {{framework}} of a collaboration between ESO and OAT concerning the development of a data reduction pipeline and the related quality control subsystems software for UVES/VLT, a detailed feasibil-ity study is being performed on the basis of data extracted from the EMMI/NTT archive. The pipeline reduction is based on an accurate set of -calibrated solutions " and will also result in a powerful tool for the release and the distribution of the scientic data, from <b>a</b> simple <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the data just collected to a complete echelle reduction with the highest possible accuracy. 1. Overview It is ESO policy to perform data reduction for VLT instruments in " mode, either at the observing premises or at headquarters. The result of the pipeline will be a quality " data product, certied by the Observatory. In order to verify if a pipeline was feasible for echelle data, in particular for UVES 1 (Ultraviolet-Visible Echelle Spectrograph), a test on EMMI 2 (ESO Multi-Mode Instrument) data acquired in echelle mode and extracted from the NTT archive was performed: • a preliminary processing pipeline was dened using the MIDAS echelle package; • a set of pre-calibrated solutions was available, and other have been de-ned, to optimize the processing speed while achieving results within an acceptable level of accuracy; • archive data were processed in pipeline mode...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} {{homogeneous}} library of high-resolution, high-S/N spectra for 48 bright AFGKM stars, {{some of them}} approaching the quality of solar-flux spectra. Our sample includes the northern Gaia benchmark stars, some solar analogs, and some other bright Morgan-Keenan (M-K) spectral standards. Well-exposed deep spectra were created by average-combining individual exposures. The data-reduction process relies on adaptive selection of parameters by using statistical inference and robust estimators. We employed spectrum synthesis techniques and statistics tools in order to characterize the spectra and give <b>a</b> first <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> some of the science cases possible. With an average spectral resolution of R= 220, 000 (1. 36 km/s), a continuous wavelength coverage from 383 nm to 912 nm, and S/N of between 70 : 1 for the faintest star in the extreme blue and 6, 000 : 1 for {{the brightest star in}} the red, these spectra are now made public for further data mining and analysis. Preliminary results include new stellar parameters for 70 Vir and alpha Tau, the detection of the rare-earth element dysprosium and the heavy elements uranium, thorium and neodymium in several RGB stars, {{and the use of the}} 12 C to 13 C isotope ratio for age-related determinations. We also found Arcturus to exhibit few-percent CaII H&K and H-alpha residual profile changes with respect to the KPNO atlas taken in 1999.
