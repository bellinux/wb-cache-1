500|$|Arnold was {{initially}} sceptical when approached about directing [...] "EastEnders Live", but agreed {{once it was}} explained that {{the impetus for the}} episode was motivated by the [...] "whodunnit" [...] storyline. He explained: [...] "We pre-record TV drama for lots of very good reasons <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> live episode can sometimes come across a little gimmicky, so for me, story is the one and only reason a drama should go live." [...] Direction of the episode differed from typical episodes of EastEnders, whereby actors briefly run through their lines, block the scene to be filmed, then begin shooting with the director on the studio floor. For [...] "EastEnders Live", cast and crew had two weeks to work on the episode, rehearsing, blocking scenes and discussing the characters' journeys at length.|$|E
500|$|The film is set {{six months}} after the events of The Avengers. In the film Tony Stark {{experiences}} PTSD-like symptoms following the Battle of New York in The Avengers. Black explained, [...] "that's an anxiety response to feeling inferior to The Avengers, but also to being humbled by sights he cannot possibly begin to understand or reconcile with the realities he's used to... There's a line in the movie about 'ever since that big guy with the hammer fell out of the sky, the rules have changed'. That's what we're dealing with here." [...] Bruce Banner appears in a post-credits scene, with Ruffalo reprising the role. About the scene, Ruffalo said [...] "They were about to wrap the movie and I saw Robert [...] at the Academy Awards... and he said, 'What do you think about coming <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> day?' I said, 'Are you kidding me? Bang, lets do it!' We sort of spitballed that scene, then I came in and we shot {{for a couple of hours}} and laughed." ...|$|E

500|$|Lewis did {{not share}} the desire of some members to keep the CCF [...] "ideologically pure", and adhered to the Bundist belief that [...] "it was better {{to go along with}} the masses in a not totally correct {{direction}} than to separate oneself from them and remain 'purist'." [...] However, the CCF was as much a movement as it was a political party, and its own members frequently undermined it with radical proclamations. [...] Lewis criticized the British Columbia CCF for such comments, saying [...] "... what we say and do must be measured by the effect which it will have on our purpose of mobilizing people for action. [...] If what we say and do will blunt or harm our purpose... then we are saying <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> false thing even if, in the abstract, it is true... When, in heaven's name are we going to learn that working-class politics and the struggle for power are not a Sunday-school class where purity of godliness and the infallibility of the Bible must be held up without fear of consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|Davies {{believed}} that Lee's film did not overcome [...] "the {{problem of the}} guys who get the girls not seeming quite good enough", and set out {{to try to find a}} way of making them into heroes in his script. He said that Austen should have made the reader feel that Edward was worthy of Elinor and explained how Marianne falls in love with Colonel Brandon, after having her heart broken by Willoughby. The writer increased the male roles, so they could be turned into stronger characters. Davies told Hill that the team [...] "worked very hard" [...] on the men. Brandon is seen rescuing people <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> lot of fast horse riding, while Edward was given a wood-chopping scene where he vents his frustrations about his engagement. Davies also made the Dashwood sisters younger and [...] "more vulnerable" [...] than how they were portrayed in Lee's film. Hattie Morahan, who portrayed Elinor in the drama, stated, [...] "We are trying to play the story as it was written. In the novel the girls are 19 and 17, so these romantic relationships are real rites of passage for them." ...|$|E
500|$|Spears {{performed}} [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] during The M+M's Tour in May 2007. After {{a performance}} of [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] from In the Zone, in which Spears and her four female dancers picked {{a man from the}} audience and danced seductively around him, the stage went dark for a few seconds. Shortly after, Spears took the stage again wearing a hot pink bra, a white fur coat and a jean skirt to perform the song. The choreography was a mimicry of the music video. The song was also performed at her 2009 tour, The Circus Starring Britney Spears. It was the second song of the fourth and last act, titled [...] "Electro Circ". In some parts of the performance, Spears and her dancers carried giant guns that shot sparks. During the first shows of the first North American leg, she wore a gold metal bodysuit. However, on March 8, 2009, at the Tampa show, Spears suffered a wardrobe malfunction after her performance of [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U", which caused the outfit being changed to a sparkly black bodysuit. The song is currently being performed in Spears' Las Vegas residency [...] She is seen wearing a bodysuit <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> routine with black chairs.|$|E

500|$|For the film's look, the Coens {{wanted to}} avoid the usual retro 1960s clichés like lava lamps, Day-Glo posters, and Grateful Dead music and {{for it to be}} [...] "consistent with the whole bowling thing, we wanted to keep the movie pretty bright and poppy", Joel said in an interview. For example, the star motif {{featured}} predominantly throughout the film, started with the film's production designer Richard Heinrichs' design for the bowling alley. According to Joel, he [...] "came {{up with the idea of}} just laying free-form neon stars on top of it <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> similar free-form star thing on the interior". This carried over to the film's dream sequences. [...] "Both dream sequences involve star patterns and are about lines radiating to a point. In the first dream sequence, the Dude gets knocked out and you see stars and they all coalesce into the overhead nightscape of L.A. The second dream sequence is an astral environment with a backdrop of stars", remembers Heinrichs. For Jackie Treehorn's Malibu beach house, he was inspired by late 1950s and early 1960s bachelor pad furniture. The Coen brothers told Heinrichs that they wanted Treehorn's beach party to be Inca-themed, with a [...] "very Hollywood-looking party in which young, oiled-down, fairly aggressive men walk around with appetizers and drinks. So there's a very sacrificial quality to it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Canvassing" [...] {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of Marlene Griggs-Knope, Leslie's mother and an important public figure in the Pawnee school system. Marlene was played by Pamela Reed, who would continue to make several guest appearances as the character. During the casting auditions, Seth Gordon interviewed Reed {{as if she were}} playing the character and Reed improvised a great deal, creating many personality elements that were eventually incorporated into Marlene Knope's character. Gordon said, [...] "Pamela was especially sort of nimble on her feet at inventing a character in the room on the fly, and I thought that was really impressive." [...] During the audition, Reed was asked whether she was proud of her daughter, and Reed replied, [...] "I want my daughter to be successful, which is why I always tell her, there's nothing wrong with being a wife and mother." [...] The improvised line, which was based on something her father-in-law said to her, so impressed the producers that they incorporated it into the episode. Schur said the producers sought to establish Leslie's mother early in the series, and he felt her relationship to Leslie {{was the center of the}} entire [...] "Canvassing" [...] episode. Schur said of Leslie's attempts to impress her mom at her public forum, [...] "We imagined it in the writer's room that she is eight years old <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> piano recital, and she's nervous because her mom's there." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Adams, the {{producer}} of Murder on the Orient Express, was extremely determined to have David Suchet as the voice actor for Poirot, a major character in the game. Nixon thought that Suchet had become so intertwined with the character of Poirot, after his success with the television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, {{that it would be}} hard to imagine someone else doing Poirot's voice without constantly being compared to Suchet. Nixon described the situation as a catch-22, saying that he [...] "worried about someone coming in <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> Suchet impression instead of a unique rendition of Poirot, yet the more the voice strays from Suchet's version, the more people will wish it was Suchet doing it!" [...] Another reason for the development team's determination to have Suchet aboard was that they thought he would spur the other voice actors in the game, such as Vanessa Marshall who portrayed Antoinette Marceau, to step up and compete with Suchet's skillful portrayal of Poirot. Fairly late in the game's development, Suchet agreed to do the voice acting. He admitted that one reason for his acceptance of the offer was that he felt possessive of the role of Poirot, considering he had been portraying the character for so long. Adams expressed pride at having succeeded in convincing Suchet to do voice acting for Murder on the Orient Express, and said that his skillful voice acting would bring [...] "tremendous excitement and authenticity" [...] to the game.|$|E

500|$|As {{the guitar}} intro of [...] "Gambler" [...] started, Madonna {{stood on the}} side-stage and started dancing energetically, as {{flashlights}} fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled a steel structure present {{on the side of}} the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main one. She then performed [...] "Borderline", [...] "Lucky Star" [...] and [...] "Crazy for You"—while touching the hands of the audience members. Madonna then returned to the microphone and started singing [...] "Over and Over" [...] from Like a Virgin. It was followed by [...] "Burning Up" [...] during which she caressed one of the guitarist, ultimately disappearing for another constume change. As the music of the song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] started, Madonna returned on the stage, wearing a wedding dress, holding a bouquet in her hand and a long white veil behind her. Accessorized by a white bow atop her head and lacy, three-quarter length gloves, she also had a crucifix on her waistband and another hanging from a long chain around her neck. Madonna asked the audience [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] When the audience answered affirmatively, she threw the bouquet towards them and started singing the song. Madonna continued singing the song while rolling around the floor, and added a snippet of Michael Jackson's Motown-style single, [...] "Billie Jean". Balloons floated out towards the audience again as she pulled apart her veil and threw it towards the audience. She returned to the stage in the arms of one of the backup dancers, wearing a boob tube and a tight white skirt, carrying a bunch of notes in her left hand, and a number of garlands around her neck. In a self-parodying performance of the song [...] "Material Girl", at the end of the performance Madonna asked the audience [...] "Do you really think I'm a material girl?... I'm not... Take it ... I don't need money... I need love." [...] As she began to strip off more clothes and jewelry, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, her father Tony Ciccone himself did the honors. The show ended with Madonna returning onstage once more to take her fur coat <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> curtsey.|$|E
