5|$|The {{diagnosis}} and classification of AML can be challenging, {{and should be}} performed by a qualified hematopathologist or hematologist. In straightforward cases, the presence of certain morphologic features (such as Auer rods) or specific flow cytometry results can distinguish AML from other leukemias; however, in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> features, diagnosis may be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that Aldermaston was inhabited in the 12th century CE, possibly extending back to 1690 BCE. Radiocarbon dating on postholes and pits {{in the area}} show activity from 1690 to 1390, 1319 to 1214, and 977 to 899 BCE. Wheat and barley grains {{have been found in}} these excavations. Tests show that most of the barley was dehulled, but that <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> debris may mean that the cereal was brought in from other areas.|$|E

5|$|In {{the heart}} of lungfish, the septum extends part-way into the ventricle. This allows for some degree of {{separation}} between the de-oxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered {{to the rest of}} the body. The <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. As a result, there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other tetrapods. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle does seem to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams. Also, the original valves of the conus arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate.|$|E

25|$|Rocks {{from more}} recent {{geological}} periods {{such as the}} Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary periods usually contain lime-rich rocks. The <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> rocks {{has led to an}} acidic substrate which manifests itself {{in the nature of the}} soil.|$|E
25|$|Other exceptions, declarant's {{availability}} immaterial: In the United States Federal Rules of Evidence, separate {{exceptions are}} made for public records, family records, and records in ancient documents of established authenticity.

25|$|This {{approach}} restricts {{analysis to}} the post-Congress of Vienna epoch; it being there that great powers were first formally recognized. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a formal act of recognition {{it has been}} suggested that great power status can arise by implication, by judging the nature of a state's relations with other great powers.|$|E

25|$|The Government sent bilingual {{booklets}} {{written in}} English and Irish, explaining the Treaty, to all 2.5 million Irish households. However compendiums {{of the two}} previous treaties, of which the Lisbon Treaty {{is intended to be}} a series of reforms and amendments, remain unavailable in Ireland. Some commentators have argued that the treaty remains essentially incomprehensible in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a compendium.|$|E
25|$|Consistent {{with this}} picture, imaging by the Galileo {{spacecraft}} {{found no evidence}} of disruption of the area of Callisto antipodal to Valhalla. Such disrupted terrain normally forms as a result of focusing of the seismic energy at the opposite point after the impact. The <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> disruption supports the presence of a subsurface ocean, which would have absorbed much of the seismic energy, at the time of Valhalla's formation.|$|E
25|$|MacDonald {{moved in}} March 1924 to end {{construction}} {{work on the}} Singapore military base despite strong opposition from the Admiralty. He believed {{the building of the}} base would endanger the disarmament conference; the First Sea Lord Lord Beatty considered the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a base as dangerously imperilling British trade and territories east of Aden and could mean the security of the British Empire in the Far East being dependent on the goodwill of Japan.|$|E

25|$|During that period, the Allied charter {{carriers}} {{had begun}} replacing their obsolete propliners with contemporary turboprop and jet aircraft types, which suffered payload and range restrictions on Tempelhof's short runways. The <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> restrictions at Tegel gave airlines greater operational flexibility regarding aircraft types and destinations. This {{was the reason}} charter carriers favoured Tegel despite being less popular than Tempelhof because of its greater distance from West Berlin's city centre and poor public transport links.|$|E
25|$|Human contact, {{first by}} Polynesians, {{introduced}} new trees, other plants and animals. These included voracious {{species such as}} rats and pigs, who took a heavy toll on native birds and invertebrates that evolved in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> predators. The growing population also brought deforestation, forest degradation, treeless grasslands, and environmental degradation. As a result, many species which depended on forest habitats and food became extinct. As humans cleared land for farming, monocultural crop production replaced multi-species systems.|$|E
25|$|In {{the setting}} of acute chest pain, the {{electrocardiogram}} is the investigation that most reliably distinguishes between various causes. The ECG should be done as early as practicable, including in the ambulance if possible. If this indicates acute heart damage (elevation in the ST segment, new left bundle branch block), treatment for {{a heart attack in}} the form of angioplasty or thrombolysis is indicated immediately (see below). In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> changes, {{it is not possible to}} immediately distinguish between unstable angina and NSTEMI.|$|E
2500|$|Hooke's 1670 Gresham lecture {{explained}} that gravitation applied to [...] "all celestial bodies" [...] and added {{the principles that}} the gravitating power decreases with distance {{and that in the}} <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> any <b>such</b> power bodies move in straight lines.|$|R

60|$|What a {{loss that}} Fuller {{has not made}} a {{reference}} to his authorities for this assertion! I am sure he could have found none in the New Testament, but facts that imply, and, in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> all <b>such</b> proof, prove the contrary.|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} part of the design of variant calling methods using NGS data is the DNA sequence used as a reference to align the NGS reads to. In human genetics studies, high quality references are available, from sources such as the HapMap project, which can substantially improve the accuracy of the variant calls made by variant calling algorithms. As a bonus, such references can be a source of prior genotype probabilities for Bayesian-based analysis. However, in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a high quality reference, experimentally obtained reads can first be assembled {{in order to create a}} reference sequence for alignment.|$|E
25|$|Of course, {{not all of}} the {{possible}} states of a multi-state molecule or complex will necessarily be populated. Indeed, in systems where the number of possible states is far greater than that of molecules in the compartment (e.g. the cell), they cannot be. In some cases, empirical information can be used to rule out certain states if, for instance, some combinations of features are incompatible. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> information, however, all possible states need to be considered a priori. In such cases, computational modeling can be used to uncover to what extent the different states are populated.|$|E
25|$|Foreign Minister Dick Spring, who was {{leader of}} the Labour Party, advised her not to meet Adams, whose party was linked with the Provisional IRA. However, the Government refused to {{formally}} advise her not to meet with him. She felt it would be wrong, in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> formal advice, for her as head of state not to meet the local member of parliament during her visit, and was photographed publicly shaking his hand. During her various visits to Northern Ireland, she in fact regularly met politicians of all hues, including David Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party and John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour Party.|$|E

40|$|The Born-Oppenheimer {{approach}} to the matter-gravity system is illustrated and the unitary evolution for matter, in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> phenomena <b>such</b> as tunnelling or other instabilities, verified. The Born-Oppenheimer {{approach to}} the matter-gravity system is illustrated in a simple minisuperspace model and the corrections to quantum field theory on a semiclassical background exhibited. Within such a context the unitary evolution for matter, in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> phenomena <b>such</b> as tunnelling or other instabilities, is verified and compared {{with the results of}} other approaches.
