The knowledge people have of God {{is different from that}} which they have of anything else because God is infinite, and finite people are incapable of comprehending an infinite being. While the knowledge revealed by God to people is never incorrect, it is also never comprehensive.|$|E

The lying daughter-in-law was obligated {{by the laws of}} Yibbum to marry her {{brother-in-law}} unless released from the arrangement through a formal ceremony. As her brother-in-law was the living child, she was required to marry him when he came of age or wait {{the same amount of time}} to be released and remarry. When Solomon suggested splitting the infant in half, the lying woman, wishing to escape the constraints of Yibbum in the eyes of God, agreed.

25|$|Marx {{also argues}} that, insofar as {{capitalist}} class society is intrinsically a very contradictory system – it contains many conflicting and competing forces – the masking of its true characteristics becomes an integral feature {{of how it}} actually operates. Buyers and sellers compete with other buyers and sellers. Businesses cannot practically do so without confidentiality and secrecy. Workers compete for job opportunities and access to resources. Capitalists and workers compete for {{their share of the}} new wealth that is produced, and nations compete with other nations. The masks are therefore not optional, but necessary, and the more one is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about others, the more subtle, ingenious and sophisticated the masks become.|$|E

He explains that a child suggested he make contact with Oz with wireless telegraphy. Glinda, using her book that records everything that happens, is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that someone is using a telegraph to contact Oz, so she erects a telegraph tower and has the Shaggy Man, who knows how to make a telegraph reply, tell the story contained in this book to Baum.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{interest}} in female characters, Kon stated that female characters were easier to write {{because he is not}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the character {{in the same way as}} a male character, and [...] "can project my obsession onto the characters and expand the aspects I want to describe." [...] With a frame of reference up to Tokyo Godfathers, Susan J. Napier notes that while the theme of performance is the one obvious commonality in his works, she finds that the concept of the male gaze is the more important topic for discussion. Napier shows the evolution of Kon's use of the gaze from its restrictive and negative aspects in Magnetic Rose and Perfect Blue, to a collaborative gaze in Millennium Actress before arriving at a new type of gaze in Tokyo Godfathers which revels in uncertainty and illusion.|$|E

He explained the new battle styles, stating that while triple battles take more strategy, rotation battles take more luck to win. Masuda stated that their goal when making the games was to make it fun for new players, but they also wanted to get players who have not played the series in a while to come back. He said that it was hard to find that balance to satisfy both kinds of players. For the new players, there is good explanation in how to play, while for old players, they incorporated the C-Gear, which makes the ability to trade and battle easier. When asked about the decision to introduce over 150 new species of Pokémon, Masuda stated that they did this so old players would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what is a good Pokémon to use, and it would level the playing ground for new players.|$|E
500|$|During the 1951–1952 season, {{the program}} was {{broadcast}} from a converted NBC radio studio. The {{first year of the}} television show was done live; this led to problems as there was not enough time for costume changes; Skelton was on camera for most of the half-hour, including the delivery of a commercial which was written into one of the show's skits. In early 1952, Skelton had an idea for a television sketch about someone who had been drinking not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> which way is up. [...] The script was completed and he had the show's production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls. [...] The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the character's wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking. [...] When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he realizes he is not lying on the floor but on the living room wall. [...] Willie's wife goes about the house normally, but to Willie, she appears to be walking on a wall. [...] Within an hour after the broadcast, the NBC switchboard had received 350 calls regarding the show, and Skelton had received more than 2,500 letters about the skit within a week of its airing.|$|E
500|$|Terra's role in Birth by Sleep has {{received}} mixed critics with Adam Ghigiino from PALGN criticizing his naive personality when finding the three protagonists unappealing.

Writing for GamesRadar, Crhis Antista commented {{that he did not}} understand the importance of him and the other characters being briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II, although it could be explained once the player finishes Birth by Sleep. PlayStation LifeStyle's Thomas Williams found the trio as welcome additions to the franchise, finding their stories enjoyable even though the three travel to the same worlds. X-Play found Terra to be very similar to Riku due to his personality and vulnerability to evil's allure. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot criticized Jason Dohring's work as Terra's English voice actor, saying he [...] "can't express angst, excitement, sincerity, or any other emotion", affecting the storyline. VanOrd also pointed this out when Terra interacts with Disney characters, finding the latters' voice actors to be [...] "uniformly excellent and absolutely comparable to the original source." [...] Bob Miur from Destructoid compared Terra's storyline with the film [...] due to the struggles he faces, and found that gamers familiar to the series may realize that his fate in the game [...] "won't turn out to be very pretty." [...] Miur also commented on Dohring's work, praising how he makes Terra [...] "tortured and conflicted", but still criticizing the result. UGO Networks listed Terra's Helmet nineteenth on their list of [...] "The Coolest Helmets and Headgear in Video Games", stating [...] "For a minute, but only a minute, the two-horned helmet will get you feeling like the Keyblade is a viable weapon." [...] In a Famitsu poll, Terra was voted as the fifth most popular Kingdom Hearts character.
