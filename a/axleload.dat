25|$|The {{high power}} of the {{locomotive}} at an acceptably low <b>axleload</b> resulted in 22 similar locomotives being ordered by British Railways for use on East Coast Main Line express passenger services; the serial production of which became the British Rail Class 55.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} the {{locomotive}} is roughly proportional to the power output; {{the number of axles}} required is determined by this weight divided by the <b>axleload</b> limit for the trackage where the locomotive is to be used. The number of driving wheels is derived from the adhesive weight in the same manner, leaving the remaining axles to be accounted for by the leading and trailing bogies. Passenger locomotives conventionally had two-axle leading bogies for better guidance at speed; on the other hand, the vast increase {{in the size of the}} grate and firebox in the 20th century meant that a trailing bogie was called upon to provide support. In Europe, some use was made of several variants of the Bissel bogie in which the swivelling movement of a single axle truck controls the lateral displacement of the front driving axle (and in one case the second axle too). This was mostly applied to 8-coupled express and mixed traffic locomotives, and considerably improved their ability to negotiate curves whilst restricting overall locomotive wheelbase and maximising adhesion weight.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{locomotives}} produced were 3 axle {{versions of}} two types - a 50-ton loco (16.5 ton <b>axleload)</b> with a 500 hp V8 cylinder Dorman 8QT engine, and a 75-ton (25 ton <b>axleload)</b> machine with a 12-cylinder engine rated at 750 hp. The NCB acquired both locomotive types.|$|E
50|$|The {{weight of}} a rail per length is an {{important}} factor in determining rails strength and hence <b>axleloads</b> and speeds.|$|R
50|$|Eurolight is {{the brand}} name {{for a family of}} 4-axle Bo'Bo' {{mainline}} diesel-electric locomotives first manufactured in 2010 with sub-20-tonne <b>axleloads</b> for passenger and freight trains produced by Vossloh España.|$|R
5000|$|Queensland {{adopted a}} narrow gauge of [...] {{in order to}} make {{construction}} of lines lighter and thus cheaper, though this initiated a break-of-gauge with other states. The cost savings were due to light rails, low <b>axleloads</b> and low speeds as much as due to the gauge.|$|R
50|$|A 150 kW {{prototype}} {{was displayed}} at Innotrans (2009), the prototype bogie weight was 5.6t, with a 1.6m wheelbase and a maximum <b>axleload</b> of 14t.|$|E

50|$|A subtype PH37Aci {{has been}} {{designed}} to be built to fit within the UIC 505-1 vehicle gauge. Unlike the original version built for the UK loading gauge the design has a full width body. There are two versions of the design, one with a 20 t axle load and 450 kN starting tractive effort intended for European railways, and a 21 t <b>axleload</b> version with more powerful traction motors and starting tractive effort of 544 kN. The versions have <b>axleload</b> class L620 and L621 as defined by European Standard EN 15528 (2008).|$|E
50|$|Whitton did however {{introduce}} cheaper so-called pioneer {{lines for}} use in easier terrain once the mountains had been crossed. Money was saved by building for lower speeds and the lighest of <b>axleloads,</b> with ash ballast, no fencing, etc. These pioneer lines retained the same gauge as the main system.|$|R
5000|$|The extreme <b>axleloads</b> {{found on}} mineral {{railways}} such as iron ore railways in the Pilbara and the repetitive pounding {{of the track}} by trains consisting of identical wagons was found to lead to deterioration of the track. Research was needed to establish the exact cause and determine solutions. Since heavy haul railways exist in several countries, it seemed sensible to establish an association to investigate these problems jointly.|$|R
50|$|The Fortescue Railway, {{owned and}} {{operated}} by Fortescue Metals Group (FMG), is a private rail network in the Pilbara region of Western Australia built to carry iron ore opening in 2008. Upon completion, the railway line was the heaviest haul railway in the world, designed for 40 tonnes <b>axleloads,</b> 2.5 to 5 tonnes heavier than the other Pilbara iron ore rail systems. On 4 November 2014, FMG Rail commenced trialing 42 tonnes axle loads.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} has a pneumatic disc brake, as well {{as being}} able to brake regeneratively. Standard operating speed is 70 km/h or 65 km/h when ballasted to 25 t <b>axleload.</b>|$|E

50|$|As newer power became available, the locomotives’ low <b>axleload</b> {{made them}} ideal {{candidates}} for transfers elsewhere. consequently, between 1931 and 1942, twenty-five locomotives {{were transferred to}} Scotland for use on the former Great North of Scotland Railway lines.|$|E
5000|$|Ghana Railway Development Authority {{has invited}} bids {{to convert the}} 950 km rail network from [...] narrow gauge to {{standard}} gauge, permitting 25 tonne <b>axleloads</b> and increasing speeds from 56 to 160 km/h. In the longer term, feasibility studies will look at introducing a suburban rail service from Accra to Kasoa, Winneba and Madina, as well as extending the railway {{to the north and}} connecting with the proposed Ecowas rail line across West Africa.|$|R
5000|$|Sierra Leone had a [...] {{narrow gauge}} railway with 5 t <b>axleloads.</b> Train loads were {{necessarily}} very limited, which increased costs counter-productively, as {{large numbers of}} small trains were needed to haul tonnages that heavier railways could haul with fewertrains. For example, in 1956 fourteen modern 4-8-2+2-8-4 Garratts were purchased from Beyer-Peacock. [...] These locos increased the maximum load over 1:50 grades from 200 tons (203 tonnes) to 270 tons (274 tonnes).|$|R
5000|$|In 2010 {{the company}} {{launched}} a new locomotive type: the diesel electric Eurolight locomotive, designed for railways requiring <b>axleloads</b> less than 20t, and with either 2.3 or 2.8MW installed engine power. In September 2012, Vossloh unveiled a mockup of the [...] "Desert Hawk" [...] locomotive, a single ended development of its Euro locomotive design intended for use in push-pull passenger trains in hot and sandy conditions. The rail-vehicles division was announced as sold to Stadler in late 2015.|$|R

50|$|The China Standardized EMU is 209m long, 3360mm {{wide and}} 4060mm high. It has an <b>axleload</b> {{of less than}} 17 tonnes. The train can carry 556 passengers, with 10 in {{business}} class, 28 in first class, and 518 in second class. The train also reduces energy consumption, and adopts a standard parts design. It also has reinforced safety features compared with other EMUs.|$|E
40|$|Lubrication at {{wheel flange}} and rails on sharp curves is {{considered}} {{as an effective}} solution for reducing wear loss of material from effective cross-section of rail and wheels. Rail administrations {{around the world have}} been increasing <b>axleloads</b> and traffic densities in rail networks. This has led to traffic initiated wear, fatigue initiated surface cracks and railbreaks. Limited research has been carried out on the overall impact of combining lubrication strategies and rail grinding. This paper presents a model for lubrication strategy and rail-grinding interval to reduce wear and rolling contact fatigue (RCF). Data from rail industry is collected and used for numerical illustration...|$|R
50|$|The first {{examples}} were despatched to depots at Wolverhampton, Bristol, Gloucester, Shrewsbury, Westbury in Wiltshire and Neyland in South Wales. In October 1938 No.7805 Broome Manor underwent clearance tests between Ruabon and Barmouth. Subsequently, {{the class}} were used over the main {{lines of the}} erstwhile Cambrian Railways, with its headquarters and works in Oswestry. The Manors were also successfully employed in the West Country where they were used for banking and piloting trains over the Devon banks between Newton Abbot and Plymouth. Their light <b>axleloading</b> also allowed them across the Tamar Bridge {{and on to the}} branch lines of Cornwall.|$|R
40|$|Analysis of Kancil 2 ̆ 7 s Knuckle Prototype. The {{objective}} of this work is to execute strength analysis of knuckle, whichis made from FCD 50, by using static analysis on maximum loading. This maximum loading is obtained from front <b>axleloading</b> calculation on particular operating condition. That is, vehicle is braking while cornering in down hill. Fromprevious vehicle loading calculation, we get a number of loading values on different speed and deceleration. At the end,we get a value of speed and deceleration that guarantee the vehicle safety if it is braking while cornering in down hill. As comparison, loading calculation is executed too for same operating condition on level ground. This is because ofdifferent deceleration for each operating condition, 0, 5 g for operating condition on downhill and 0, 2 g on level ground. The result shows that maximum loading occurred when vehicle is operated on down hill is larger than on level ground. Study of static focused on quantitative description of loads that act on technical structure in equilibrium...|$|R
50|$|Wagner {{had wanted}} {{locomotives}} which were long-lasting {{and easy to}} maintain, and unlike British engineers did not consider a high power-to-weight ratio a priority. The resulting Kriegslokomotive had a low <b>axleload</b> of 15 tons and could haul 40 percent more freight than the old Prussian locomotives they replaced. The class 52 could haul 1,200 tons at 65 kph (40 mph) without significant strain.|$|E
5000|$|The railway {{was built}} with 30lb rail, {{limiting}} <b>axleload</b> to 5 tons. Some of the extensions were built as [...] "tramways", with rail weight reduced to 20 and even 15 lb. In {{an effort to}} increase axle loadings and the speed limit above 20 mph (32.2 km/h), some sections of the line were rebuilt with 40 lb rail in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} used components {{from the}} 20-22 t <b>axleload</b> Vossloh Euro locomotive series, {{but with a}} C175 engine from Caterpillar Inc. (12- or 16-cylinder of 2.3 or 2.8 MW) and traction electronics from ABB Group. The CAT engines meet European Stage IIIA emission standards, and can be modified to meet 2012 IIIB emission standards by replacing the exhaust silencer with a diesel particulate filter.|$|E
40|$|High {{wheel-rail contact}} stress {{is related to}} rail damage {{mechanisms}} such as gross plastic flow. Such high contact stresses are often generated by freight vehicles which have comparatively high <b>axleloads.</b> On railways in Great Britain (GB) a limit {{is placed on the}} ratio of static wheel load (Q) to wheel diameter (D) as a proxy to control contact stress related damage. However, there is increasing interest in the use of smaller diameter wheels on freight vehicles, in order to prolong wheelset life (smaller scrap diameter) and increase capacity within the GB’s constrained structure gauge. GB Railway Group Standards [1] limit Q/D to 0. 13 kN/mm. However it is known that a number of freight wagons already operate above this limit, either due to derogations granted against the standard, or as a result of being introduced prior to the standard’s universal application (‘Grandfather Rights’). At least one vehicle type is known to operate with a Q/D ratio of up to 0. 165 kN/mm. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the contact stress state of the GB network. This formed part of a larger study [2] undertaken with a view to allowing a reduction in wheel diameters for freight vehicles. The research was conducted as part of the industry’s R&D programme managed by the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) ...|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} reasons for {{measuring}} roughness: 1) to assess quality of construction, 2) to assess riding quality, and 3) to obtain pavement service and life histories [...] from which adequacy of a structural design criteria may be deduced, The report submitted herewith presents summaries and analyses {{of several years}} of measurements. This {{is the first time}} we have attempted to make interpretations and generalizations regarding long-term performance. The enabling fact is that some interstate and parkway pavements are approaching or have exceeded their half-life in terms of years of service or in terms of accumulated 18 -kip <b>axleloads.</b> As recently as three years ago, the year-to-year variations in roughness measurements obtained from the interstate and toll road pavements seemed too spurious for analysis. It appears now that the spurious effects in the early life of pavements arise from settlement of embankments and a seating effect (a more local subsidence) in bituminous pavements and a warping effect in portland cement concrete pavements. Winter�tirne heaving may also affect the year-to-year roughness. Here we have indications that some pavements become smoother with the passing of time and traffic; some seem unaffected; while others show steady increases in roughness. The statistical trends shown in the report must be viewed cautiously. The serviceability index concept of rating pavement condition, which originated in conjunction wit...|$|R
50|$|In 2009 Vossloh {{announced}} {{its intention to}} expand its diesel locomotive range to include further shunting/light mainline locomotives with either hydraulic or electric transmissions, and to produce a mainline diesel-electric locomotive (EURO Light) for markets where an <b>axleload</b> below 20 t is required. The four-axle EuroLight was designed to have a low axle load for use on cross-border operations on non-electrified European secondary routes, enabling operators to bypass bottlenecks on main corridors.|$|E
5000|$|The railway's 240-wagon {{iron ore}} trains are amongst the {{heaviest}} trains in the world, The [...] (standard gauge) heavy haul railway {{is used by}} 35200 t trains up to 2.5 km long carrying 29000 t of ore at 40 t <b>axleload</b> (the weight of the two [...] engines is extra).

50|$|The 'Trojan' range {{included}} B,C,B'B' and C'C' wheel arrangement designs, with an <b>axleload</b> {{of up to}} 25 tonnes, {{and capable}} of being built to track gauges between 610mm and 1676mm. Locomotives could be supplied {{with a variety of}} diesel engines, up to , with diesel electric or diesel hydraulic transmissions, with either radial arm or commonwealth type bogie suspension designs, and with single or double cab variants. The family was designed for industrial operators, and trip work.|$|E
50|$|Starting in 1932, a {{programme}} {{of rebuilding}} the B12 locomotives with larger diameter boilers. The Diagram 99A boilers utilised were 5 ft diameter, {{compared with the}} 5 ft diameter originals. These rebuilt locomotives were classified as class B12/3, and as they had a higher <b>axleload,</b> none of the Scottish-allocated locomotives were included. The last to be rebuilt was 8549 in 1944, leaving 8534 as the last English B12/1; but it was withdrawn the following year without being rebuilt.|$|E
50|$|Construction of this {{lattice truss}} bridge started on 27 October 1891 and {{finished}} in March 1893. It {{is situated in}} a curve. It is 111 m long and 11 m high. Its weight was 5000 Zentner (250 t). Two masonry piers support the bridge between its abutments. The replacement, planned for between 1991 and 1995, was not carried out following the German reunification, even though wear and tear required restrictions of the permitted <b>axleload</b> to 16 t, and the maximum velocity to 10 km/h.|$|E
50|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the Garratts would see more service on main lines than on the lighter branch lines, it was decided to increase the tractive effort of a number of the class by enlarging the cylinder diameter and by altering the weight distribution by removing liners from the bogies. This increased the <b>axleload</b> on each of the driving wheels by approximately 2 LT with 30 locomotives treated. To distinguish these improvements the double plus sign ++ was painted after the number and they were nicknamed Super Garratts. These 30 were also fitted with dual controls for bunker first running and denoted DC. To accommodate them, 105 ft turntables were installed at Broadmeadow, Enfield and Werris Creek depots.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1920 and 1926 {{they were}} rebuilt with superheaters, {{but with the}} arrival of newer types - and the {{increase}} in passenger traffic - they came to be used on all sorts of passenger trains on the trunk lines. Immediately after the Mukden Incident four were lent out to another railway. In 1933, six were transferred to the Manchukuo National Railway, where they were used on the construction of new lines, along with regular passenger duties. Due to the <b>axleload</b> of the Pashina class being too heavy for use on the mainline north of Xinjing (Changchun), after the extension of the Asia Express to Harbin in 1935, the Pashii class was used on the Xinjing-Harbin section, which was formally owned by the MNR.|$|E
