40|$|McConnell, Jennifer E. RighmanProgressive {{collapse}} {{occurs when}} local failure(s) {{of one or}} {{a limited number of}} structural components propagate to cause failure of {{a significant portion of the}} structure that is disproportionate to the original damage. Interest in mitigation of progressive collapse began after the full or partial collapses of structures such as the Ronan Point Apartments and Alfred P. Murrah Building. Current design guidelines exist for improving the progressive collapse resistance of structures, but these guidelines do not consider the potential catenary action of structural members under extreme deformation, which can potentially increase the load-resisting capacity of beams and girders compared to flexural capacity alone. By evaluating the potential catenary response, the actual behavior under extreme events can be more accurately considered and designed for and improved economy may also result. In this thesis, a broad literature review was first performed to understand the prior work in this area and assess the practical limitations for developing catenary action. Then finite element analyses (FEA) were utilized, using ABAQUS, to determine and quantify the behavior of steel girders under a representative design scenario for the alternate path method of progressive collapse design, where a single column is removed from the structure. Several models were created to investigate the effects of: residual stresses; geometric imperfections; and support conditions, on the behavior of the steel girders under extreme load. Girder rotation, percentage of web depth in tension, and quantification of connection forces were all measured to analyze the girder behavior. The results of the analyses revealed that girders with fixed supports were able to resist 80 % more applied load after the flexural capacity of the girder was reached, regardless of the presence or absence of geometric imperfections and residual stresses. This compared to the shear support girder resisting only 30 % more applied load after flexural capacity. All fixed support girders showed a constant increase in percentage of web depth in tension after the flexural capacity was reached up to a prescribed failure rotation of 0. 05 radians, confirming catenary behavior is being utilized under additional applied load. At the failure rotation of 0. 05 radians (a value selected based on review of past research), <b>axial</b> <b>connection</b> forces for the fixed support girders were between 350 kips and 372 kips. These results show that steel girders are able to utilize catenary behavior to resist additional applied load past their flexural capacity, which results in very large <b>axial</b> <b>connection</b> forces. It is suggested that consideration of these forces be incorporated in future efforts aimed to reduce the probability of progressive collapse. University of Delaware, Department of Civil EngineeringM.

40|$|Plants are sessile {{organisms in}} need to {{acclimate}} {{to the changes}} in the surrounding environment by changing their metabolism and growth behavior. Responses to external stimuli such as gravity, light, or touch can result in tightly coordinated growth responses, regulating the final shape and size of an organ. The coordination of organ growth has to occur on several levels. Plant cells are surrounded by a rigid cell wall, which governs final cell shape and cell size. These walls allow for expansion by deposition and loosening of cell wall material; and simultaneously for directionality through alignment of the load-bearing cellulose fibrils. At the same time, these cell walls generate a connecting matrix that links adjacent cells and requires for these cells to grow in units, so called symplastic growth. ^ In plants with helical aligned cell files along <b>axial</b> organs, this <b>connection</b> through the cell wall is thought to cause cells to rotate in-phase around the organ axis, with a decrease of cell file length and angle towards organ axis from the outer cell layers inwards. At the same time, if cell anisotropy is not altered, the organ diameter increases dependent on the angle described by the cell files. ^ In addition to these biomechanical constraints imposed on cells within one organ, cell directionality also affects organ growth behavior. If elongating cells are oriented helically around an axial organ, their growth axis is not aligned with the organs growth axis. The cell growth vector can be divided into its components parallel and perpendicular to the organ growth axis, the first one drives organ growth, the second a rotation of the organ tip, both in an angle dependent manner. Organ growth is decreased, most likely due to the parallel vector component being shorter than the cell growth vector. ^ Cell directionality is regulated by several cellular factors. Cortical microtubules are positioned along the plasma membrane of the cell. In elongating cells they are organized in parallel arrays, approximately perpendicular to the growth axis of the cell, forming 2 ̆ 2 hoop-like 2 ̆ 2 structures around the cell. They are thought to guide cellulose producing enzyme complexes into and within the plasma membrane, resulting in cellulose fibrils being aligned in a similar manner. Cellulose fibril alignment in turn guides turgor pressure driven expansion, and thus directionality of cell expansion. In this work, the mutant twd 1, defective in a FKBP-like immunophilin that displays a helical cell file orientation, was used to elucidate relationships between cell-cell and cell-organ growth, as well as to investigate cortical microtubules and cell wall components in regard to the altered cell file orientation. ...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide ophthalmologists are daily {{confronted with}} eye {{diseases}} {{as a result}} of cardiovascular diseases with associated deterioration of the eye blood circulation (for example systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease and many more). Even in the pathogenesis of glaucoma the blood circulation of the eye or the optic nerve head plays an equally important role as the intraocular pressure. As with pressure in the systemic circulation, pressure and blood flow conditions in the eye are also dynamic variables: The eye pressure rises and falls simultaneously with the heart's rhythm, and presents itself quantitatively as systolic and diastolic pressure in the eye – the difference between the systolic and diastolic eye pressure is called the ocular pulse amplitude. A few years ago quantification of these synchronised pulse pressure fluctuations was not possible without much effort for examiner and patient. Since 2004 the PASCAL® dynamic contour tonometer has become available nationwide in Germany. For the first time the diastolic pressure in the eye and the ocular pulse amplitude are relatively simple to measure in a tolerable time frame for examiner and patient. A particular advantage of the modern PASCAL® System, compared with other previously existing tonometers, is it’s independence from corneal conditions. This means the real intraocular pressure can be measured non-invasive for the first time. However, the assessment of the ocular pulse amplitude proves to be problematic, because uniformly accepted standard values are not available. The aim of this study was primarily the creation of standard values for the ocular pulse amplitude, measured with the PASCAL® System. In addition, the mean difference of ocular pulse amplitude within a pair of eyes should be determined and the results of the dynamic contour tonometry should be investigated in relation to the factors which could influence them. With the acceptance of the ethics committee a healthy population of 208 subjects were recruited (m: f = 104 : 104) in the Schlosspark-Clinic Berlin. Statistics based on anamnestic data, blood pressure, pulse rate, visual acuity and refraction, ocular axis length, anterior chamber depth, corneal thickness/ radius, results of ophthalmologic function tests (motility, pupil reaction) and examinations of the anterior and posterior eye segments with the slit lamp, intraocular pressure measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry and ocular pressure and ocular pulse amplitude using PASCAL® dynamic contour tonometry. Our studies showed a mean difference in ocular pulse amplitude within a pair of eyes of 0. 12 ± 0. 04 mm Hg (mean value with confidence interval P = 95 %) with little gender difference (mean m: f = 0. 13 : 0. 10 mm Hg). Evaluations of other statistical data were carried out randomly according to statistic standards, so that in each case either a right or left eye was randomly chosen per person for the study. Due to a statistically significant “tonography effect” on the observed pressure data only the first value of a series of measurements from three measurements was used for the statistical analysis. The determined standard values show a significant gender difference (p = 0. 0129) with 2. 20 mm Hg for males (Prognosis range: 1. 09 mm Hg to 3. 91 mm Hg) and 2. 45 mm Hg for females (Prognosis range: 1. 05 mm Hg to 4. 81 mm Hg). The comparison between the raised intraocular pressure values with PASCAL® System and Goldmann applanation tonometry revealed an average difference of 0. 52 mm Hg (95 % CI: 0. 12 to 0. 92 mm Hg) for women and 1. 66 mm Hg (95 % CI: 1. 14 to 2. 17 mm Hg) for men. Within the framework of monofactorial analysis we found that there are for both sexes a negative correlation between ocular pulse amplitude and axial length and a positive correlation with the intraocular pressure. Regarding corneal thickness, astigmatism, corneal radius, age, systemic blood pressure, blood pressure amplitude and pulse rate in the monofactorial studies no correlation to ocular pulse amplitude could be found. Multifactorial analysis revealed that from all collected factors for the male sex the <b>axial</b> length in <b>connection</b> with pulse rate influences the ocular pulse amplitude, and for the female sex the <b>axial</b> length in <b>connection</b> with the raised eye pressure by applanation tonometry. Our results indicate that women and men need a differentiated view because of the significant differences. The measured variables only show a partial influence on the ocular pulse amplitude. Besides the genetic factor also hormonal differences and individual biomechanical properties of the eye {{play an important role in}} connection with the ocular pulse amplitude, which requires further investigations. In consideration of the sum of our results and the literature research, the PASCAL® dynamic contour tonometry is not just an alternative to applanation tonometry. Especially by its independence from the corneal thickness in a wide range, the data of the intraocular pressure is more precise, what is essential for the therapy and monitoring of glaucoma. Furthermore the ocular pulse amplitude can be measured in parallel with relatively little effort for examiner and patient, which is an additional advantage: The more than a century of glaucoma diagnosis ruling focus on the intraocular pressure alone is extended for each ophthalmologic practice. In addition, the ocular pulse amplitude also serves as a useful diagnostic criteria in the context of many other diseases that affect not only ocular but also the cerebral or systemic vascular system. However, until the measuring of ocular pulse amplitude is well established in clinical practice, even more extensive experiences and studies for better understanding of the dependent variables and specific changes by different diseases are needed...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that myopia percentages have enormously increased in children populations during last years, especially in East Asia countries. This increasing tendency, {{seem to be the}} result of a combination of several genetic and environmental factors. The main purposes of the certain research are: a) the evaluation of the prevalence of myopic refractive error in children who are regularly physically exercised b) the study of the correlation of ocular biometric parameters, such as the axial length and the mean corneal radius of curvature, with the myopic refraction per age c) the assessment of the role of genetic and environmental factors in the development and progress of myopia d) the correlation study between the visual acuity and sport’s performance and e) the study of the quality of vision at physically exercised children. For this reason a sample consisted of 237 male soccer athletes of the OFI Sport Academy was examined, with age ranging from 7 to 16 years old (Mean age = 10. 95 years, SD = 2. 00 years). The examination procedure included automated refraction (Huvitz HRK 7000), visual acuity measurement (modified ETDRS charts) and optical biometry of the eye (Zeiss IOL Master). Furthermore, several athletes’ personal data was recorded (e. g. training level, dominant eye / leg etc.) and three types of questionnaires were distributed to be fulfilled either by the children, their parents or their coaches. The percentage of myopia prevalence (SER 2 - 0. 75 and VA <: 0. 8) in our sample hardly reached 8. 4 %, significantly lower than the general student population (~ 38 %) (Plainis et al., 2008). A significant negative relationship was found between a) axial length and SER (r = - 0. 49), b) axial length to mean corneal radius of curvature ratio and SER (r = - 0. 70). It was also observed an increasing tense of the <b>axial</b> length in <b>connection</b> with the age (0. 11 mm per year), while mean corneal radius of curvature and visual acuity remained constant. Axial length to mean corneal radius of curvature ratio differed significantly per age group (p < 0. 001), on the other hand SER did not (p = 0. 13). In addition, the percentages of hyperopic athletes decreased significantly according to the age (p = 0. 003), whereas there was not a significant change in myopic percentages (p = 0. 19) even if an increasing tendency was presented. As far as the genetic and the environmental factors which are associated with the prevalence of myopia at athletes are concerned, it was found that parental myopia (p < 0. 001) and higher level of parents’ education (p = 0. 03) was positively correlated with the myopic refractive error of their children. An inverse relationship between the additional athletic activities and the myopic error (p = 0. 04) was also found, while there was no correlation between near work activities (studying, computer usage etc.) and myopia. Furthermore, we concluded that high ability athletes had better VA than low ability athletes (Mean difference: 0. 07 logMAR). Finally it was observed that approximately one out of three athletes: a) has not visited an eye-specialist for more than two years and b) although his visual acuity is reduced less than 8 / 10, does not use a refractive correction. The above findings bring out the importance of regular eye check during school age, due to the rapid change of refractive error. In conclusion we would state that the multi factorial character of myopia is confirmed for one more time in this research. The results of modern myopia studies’ are quite ambiguous, i. e. that there are certain points to be more methodically and extensively investigated. The study shows that sports and generally outdoor activities, may have a protective role on myopia prevalence during the school age, thus these issues should be deeper reevaluated and reinvestigated in future research...|$|R
