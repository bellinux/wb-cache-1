[...] The closing track, [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", was critical of revolutions. Townshend explained, [...] "a revolution is only a revolution in the long run <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> are going to get hurt". The song features the Lowrey organ fed through an ARP synthesizer, which came from Townshend's original demo and was re-used for the finished track.|$|E

An audience of Los Angeles entertainment journalists, critics, and others greeted the film with guffaws and hoots at a screening in Century City while other viewers in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore responded with derisive laughter or simply walked out. At a post-launch publicity event, Travolta, on asking assembled journalists if they had enjoyed it, received no reply. He later asserted that other filmmakers had enjoyed the movie: [...] "When I felt better about everything was when George Lucas and Quentin Tarantino, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> that I felt {{knew what they were}} doing, saw it and {{thought it was a great}} piece of science fiction."

In an interview with Dustin Fitzharris of Out, Wyatt explained that the song has an ambiguous meaning, [...] "It can deal with addiction. It can deal with just the basic instincts – {{some of them are}} wonderful {{and some of them are}} very dangerous." [...] In a separate interview with Joe Zadeh for Clash, Wyatt deemed it a [...] "very simple song" [...] and elaborated on its subject matter, [...] "Directing your attention to man's underlying nature and how sometimes things in society just don't work out to meet your needs. <b>And</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> end up feeling very dissatisfied.

Kim finished first ahead of Ohno but was disqualified for impeding, awarding the gold medal to Ohno. Fourth-place finisher of the race, Fabio Carta of Italy, showed his disagreement with the disqualification decision saying it was [...] "absurd that the Korean was disqualified". China's Jiajun Li, who moved from bronze to silver, remained neutral saying: [...] "I respect {{the decision of the}} referee, I'm not going to say any more". Steven Bradbury, the 1000m gold-medal winner, also shared his views: [...] "Whether Dong-Sung moved across enough to be called for cross-tracking, I don't know, he obviously moved across a bit. It's the judge's interpretation. A lot of people will say it was right <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> will say it's wrong.

Regarding the Ninth Doctor's less eccentric character, Davies stated: [...] "He travels in time and space, he's got two hearts, he's a Time Lord— that's eccentric enough to be getting on with". In contrast with previous Doctors, the Ninth Doctor speaks with a distinct Northern accent. Remarking on this aspect of his characterisation Eccleston states that the character [...] "is a scientist and an intellectual, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> seem to think you can only be those things if you speak with received pronunciation which, of course, is rubbish." [...] In regards to the Doctor's costume, consisting of simply a black leather coat and dark trousers, Eccleston stated, [...] "I didn't want the costume to be my performance" [...] and that [...] "I wanted any flamboyance and colour to come out of my acting." [...] Eccleston thought that as the Doctor he should show a [...] "slight dark side" [...] but also bring out a lighter side.

[...] Whedon, who is a friend of both producer Greg Daniels and Jenna Fischer, and also met most of the production staff prior to the episode, stated that he chose to direct the episode [...] "because I already know the writing staff and a bunch of the cast, and I adore the show." [...] When informed that the episode was about a bat entering into the office and one of the characters pretending to be a vampire, Whedon thought that it was a joke, stating [...] "Didn't I just leave this party?" [...] in reference to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. [...] In an interview featured on the third season DVD, Whedon joked that the [...] "Business School" [...] episode and his former TV show were very similar because [...] "Buffy [...] was sad and depressing but... it was funny.

[...] "I wouldn't say freedom to do things with it...But way more input was asked for than I would have ever anticipated." [...] At Pam's art show, the pieces which she was supposed to have painted didn't suit Whedon. [...] "I got to the set and saw Pam's art, and I was like, 'This is not right.'"

2500|$|Parks {{initially}} {{became aware}} of the Beach Boys during their early popularity in the early 1960s. Speaking of them in 1995, he said, [...] "I knew they didn't surf.…I felt some resentment about , and I had been a fan of Four Freshmen and 5 Trombones.…Instinctively, I was not a Beach Boy fan. 'Something really dumb about it.'" [...] He added that, [...] "I loved Pet Sounds, you see. I came back to love them, and thought they had done a great job. It seemed to me that they would be fine in fighting spirit to take on this challenge of wresting that trophy {{out of the hands of}} those interlopers."

2500|$|In 1976, Wilson intimated: [...] "Once you've {{been labeled}} as a genius, {{you have to}} {{continue}} it or your name becomes mud. I am {{a victim of the}} recording industry.

[...] Parks echoed that Taylor's line [...] "forced Brian Wilson to have to continuously prove that he's a genius and not just a lucky guy with a tremendous amount of talent <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> collaborating beautifully around him." [...] To expand his creative conceptions, Wilson turned to drugs, which Love says ultimately became his undoing: [...] "It was hard enough to match the Beatles, but now he had to keep up with Mozart?". By 1967, Wilson said that he had run out of ideas [...] "in a conventional sense", and that he was [...] "about ready to die". After 1967's Wild Honey, he relinquished his creative hold on the Beach Boys. } From 1968 onward, his songwriting output declined substantially, but the public narrative of [...] "Brian-as-leader" [...] continued. Following the 1969 termination of their contract to Capitol Records, the band's new contract with Reprise stipulated Brian's proactive involvement with the band in all albums. Producer Terry Melcher remembered how in one recording session from 1975, Wilson refused to go near the mixing board: [...] "He knows his reputation, so he makes a lot of unfinished records; sometimes, I feel that he feels that he's peaked and does not want to put his stamp on records so that peers will have a Brian Wilson track to criticize." ...|$|E

The reason for the killing was that they had asked him to abandon the Muslim League and join the Unionist Party (UP), but he refused. The killing sparked an outrage among Muslims in Asmara <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> turned up the next day for his funeral to show their stand against the terrorist activities of the UP. A well organised funeral procession was arranged and attended by youth and Muslim dignitaries. The procession passed through three main streets before they reached the street where the UP Office was located. According to the Mufti, then the UP members started first to throw stones at the procession which was followed by three grenades and then chaos followed. There was open confrontation between both sides and many were killed and injured from both sides. The Police intervened by firing live ammunition, but the confrontations continued. Despite all this, the procession continued to the cemetery where the body was buried. The riots then spread to other areas and took a dangerous sectarian form. Many properties were also looted and burned. On Wednesday, the British Military Administration (BMA) declared a curfew from 5pm to 5am, but the riots continued, On Friday the curfew was extended to 22 hours.|$|E
