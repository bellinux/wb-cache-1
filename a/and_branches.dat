5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} forages along {{tree trunks}} <b>and</b> <b>branches</b> {{in a similar}} way to woodpeckers and treecreepers, but does not use its tail for additional support, instead progressing in jerky hops using its strong legs and feet.

5|$|Mycena inclinata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, deriving its {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves, twigs, bark <b>and</b> <b>branches.</b> It accomplishes this by producing enzymes capable of {{breaking down the}} three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches forage along {{tree trunks}} <b>and</b> <b>branches</b> and {{are members of}} the same feeding guild as {{woodpeckers}}. Unlike woodpeckers and treecreepers, however, they do not use their tails for additional support, relying instead on their strong legs and feet to progress in jerky hops. They are able to descend head-first and hang upside-down beneath twigs <b>and</b> <b>branches.</b> Kr√ºper's nuthatch can even stretch downward from an upside-down position to drink water from leaves without touching the ground. Rock nuthatches forage with a similar technique to the woodland species, but seek food on rock faces and sometimes buildings. When breeding, a pair of nuthatches will only feed within their territory, but at other times will associate with passing tits or join mixed-species feeding flocks.|$|E

5|$|The tree {{may also}} be {{attacked}} by the horse chestnut scale insect (Pulvinaria regalis) which sucks sap from the trunk <b>and</b> <b>branches,</b> but does not cause serious damage to the tree. Sometimes squirrels will strip the bark off branches, girdling the stem; as a result whole branches may die, leaving brown, wilted leaves.|$|E
5|$|According to the International Energy Agency, {{cellulosic}} ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} biofuels {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems <b>and</b> <b>branches</b> of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{have been}} documented using lures to hunt prey such as birds. This means {{they are among the}} first reptiles recorded to use tools. By balancing sticks <b>and</b> <b>branches</b> on their heads, American alligators are able to lure birds looking for suitable nesting material to kill and consume. This strategy, which is shared by the mugger crocodile, is particularly effective during the nesting season, in which birds are more likely to gather appropriate nesting materials.|$|E
5|$|Arboreal carton nests of {{mangrove}} swamp-dwelling Nasutitermes are {{enriched in}} lignin and depleted in cellulose and xylans.

Arboreal termites nests can account {{for as much as}} 2% of above ground carbon storage in Puerto Rican mangrove swamps. These Nasutitermes nests are mainly composed of partially biodegraded wood material from the stems <b>and</b> <b>branches</b> of mangrove trees, namely, Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Laguncularia racemose (white mangrove).|$|E

5|$|Ecologically, {{woodpeckers}} {{help to keep}} trees healthy {{by keeping}} them from suffering mass infestations. The family is noted {{for its ability to}} acquire wood-boring grubs from the trunks <b>and</b> <b>branches,</b> whether the timber is alive or dead. Having hammered a hole into the wood, the prey is extracted by use of a long, barbed tongue. Woodpeckers consume beetles that burrow into trees, removing as many as 85 percent of emerald ash borer larvae from individual ash trees.|$|E

5|$|Nuthatches are omnivorous, eating mostly insects, {{nuts and}} seeds. They forage for insects hidden in or under bark by {{climbing}} along tree trunks <b>and</b> <b>branches,</b> sometimes upside-down.

Their habit of wedging a large food item in a crevice and then hacking at it with their strong bills gives this group its English name.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} impact of species, physiological age and spacing on tree form <b>and</b> <b>branching</b> at a Nelder experiment located near Rolleston, Canterbury. Two species were compared, Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus nitens, at a range of stockings from 271 stems/ha to 40, 466 stems/ha. Within the P. radiata, two different physiological ages were compared. Stocking and species significantly affected (p-value < 0. 05) tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), crown depth, branch mortality, branch angle, <b>branch</b> size <b>and</b> internode length. Only stocking was statistically significant for crown width, and height from the ground was also statistically significant for <b>branch</b> angle <b>and</b> <b>branch</b> mortality. DBH, crown width, crown depth, <b>branch</b> size <b>and</b> <b>branch</b> survival decreased with increasing stocking for both species. <b>Branch</b> angle <b>and</b> average internode length increased as stocking increased for both species, <b>and</b> <b>branch</b> angle <b>and</b> average internode length also increased as you {{moved away from the}} base of the tree. DBH, average internode length <b>and</b> <b>branch</b> size were significantly larger for P. radiata across all stockings, however <b>branch</b> mortality <b>and</b> <b>branch</b> angle were significantly larger for E. nitens. Physiological age was not statistically significant for any aspects of tree form or branching examined in this study...|$|R
