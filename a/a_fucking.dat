500|$|While {{reviewing}} the episode in 2011, Nathan Rabin of The A.V.

Whether he agrees with it or not, he didn't write it — I wrote it. So you have to say, 'Well, it's {{just a part of}} being in this band.' Now Jeff and I, we don't give a fuck. If Jeff wrote something I had a problem with, I would never even raise <b>a</b> <b>fucking</b> finger. I'd be like, 'Fuck yeah, let's do it! Gonna piss someone off? Alright!'" ...|$|E

Dunbar later said: [...] "He was quite cunning in the way he pitched his thing. He knew enough to know how to wind people up and to what extent. He was <b>a</b> <b>fucking</b> TV repairman: Yannis Mardas, none of this 'Magic Alex' shit!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Writing at The Hairpin, Jenna Wortham rebuked {{the show}} for its lack of a main black character.
