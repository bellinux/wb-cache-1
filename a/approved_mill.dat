50|$|Rangeview Library District’s {{current and}} future growth {{is due to the}} support of the Adams County community, who in November 2006 voted to <b>approve</b> a <b>mill</b> levy to help fund the library. Since then, through the {{leadership}} of library director Pam Sandlian Smith, the library system has shifted course and positioned itself so Anythink libraries are not only valuable resources but community gathering places.|$|R
50|$|Former Gunns director, John Gay, had {{previously}} {{put pressure on}} the state government to <b>approve</b> the <b>mill</b> quickly by threatening to take the project interstate or overseas: the company has already invested an estimated $100 million (5% of expenditure) on plans and consultants for the $2.3 billion project. Geoffrey Cousins, former adviser to John Howard, has also been a vocal opponent of the mill, comparing it to the Franklin River Dam.|$|R
25|$|Cruikshank was a {{critical}} lobbyist for passage of Medicare. He helped eliminate any role for insurance companies as underwriters of national insurance. Medicare had been bottled up in committee for years, never having enough votes to be reported out onto either chamber's floor. After the 1964 presidential election, President Lyndon B. Johnson demanded that Rep. Wilbur Mills (D-Arkansas), chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, enlarge his committee and stack it with members who would <b>approve</b> Medicare. <b>Mills</b> co-opted the AMA and grafted Medicaid onto the bill, which then easily passed the House.|$|R
50|$|It {{would be}} more than 40 years before another {{stand-alone}} school building was constructed in Little Miami. In November 1997, voters <b>approved</b> a 5.44 <b>mill,</b> 27-year bond issue that would raise $17.6 million for the purpose constructing a new high school building. The new Little Miami High School was dedicated in 2000.|$|R
40|$|Extended antipaternalism {{means the}} use of antipaternalist {{arguments}} to defend activities that harm (consenting) others. As an example, a smoker's right to smoke is often invoked in defence of the activities of tobacco companies. It can, however, be shown that antipaternalism in the proper sense does not imply such extended antipaternalism. We may therefore <b>approve</b> of <b>Mill's</b> antipaternalist principle (namely, {{that the only reason}} to interfere with someone's behaviour is to protect others from harm) without accepting activities that harm (consenting) others. This has immediate consequences for the ethics of public health. An antipaternalist need not refrain from interfering with activities such as the marketing of tobacco or heroin, boxing promotion, driving with unbelted passengers, or buying sex from "voluntary" prostitutes...|$|R
5000|$|The {{expansion}} {{came after}} a long-awaited millage referendum and the switch from Herrick's status as a public library to a district library. The switch meant that {{the control of the}} library shifted from the City of Holland to an area wide board, allowing for a more reasonable form of funding. In December 1996, the District Library Planning Committee endorsed a [...] "resolution of intent" [...] to fund a library district which was unanimously supported. Then in 1997, focus was placed on receiving a millage referendum that sought $11.5 million in funding. On May 6, 1997, the City of Holland as well as surrounding Townships voted to <b>approve</b> 1.5 <b>mills</b> for a period of 20 years to support the establishment and operation of the Herrick District Library.|$|R
50|$|In May 2006, voters <b>approved</b> a 6.15 <b>mill</b> {{bond issue}} to fund {{facility}} improvements at Morrow, Harlan-Butlerville and Hamilton-Maineville Elementaries and {{to construct a}} new intermediate school and a new junior high school. Little Miami Intermediate School, built on donated land {{at the corner of}} Zoar and Stephens Road in Hamilton Township and Little Miami Junior High School, built contiguous to the high school, were both dedicated in 2009 and opened to students.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, Erwin {{instituted a}} profit sharing and bonus program for all mill workers, {{something}} that was rare at a textile mill, especially in the South. Employees at the <b>mill</b> <b>approved</b> of Erwin’s supervision and many knew him on a personal level, as he visited {{all areas of the}} factory on a daily or weekly basis. He also funded and threw huge celebrations for the workers on holidays, particularly on July 4. The ability of mill’s management to keep workers happy was a major factor in holding the community of West Durham together because it ensured that workers had long careers at the mill, with their families residing in the mill town for many years.|$|R
50|$|Richard Blackwell was {{a pioneer}} settler in the Gordonvale area. On 18 October 1879, took up land in the Mulgrave River area known as Plain Camp, near where Gordonvale is now located. He {{reportedly}} made a gift of part of this land {{for the establishment of}} the Mulgrave Sugar Mill. The Sugar Works Guarantee Act of 1893 provided for the erection of <b>approved</b> Central <b>Mills</b> on a government loan if farmers mortgaged their land as security. After the principal and interest had been met, these Central Mills were to be handed to the growers as Cooperative Mills. The Mulgrave settler's organisation evolved from a meeting held at Tom Mackey's farm, at which Richard Blackwell was in attendance. A provisional directorate was formed with Mackey as Chairman. The original memorandum of the Association of the Mulgrave Central Mill Co Ltd dated 14 November 1893, was registered in Brisbane 20 April 1895. Signatories to this included Richard Blackwell. The nominal capital of £40,000 was increased to £60,000 in 1896. The Mulgrave Central Mill enterprise proceeded rapidly, and Richard Blackwell {{was one of the first}} directors of the Mulgrave Mill.|$|R

5000|$|Cundall was a Federal Senate {{candidate}} for Tasmania for the Communist Party of Australia in the 1961 federal election. He also supports many left wing political {{and environmental groups}} by speaking at rallies and events. He is an ardent pacifist and is a keen environmentalist. He was the Chairman of the Tasmanian Wilderness Society during the battle to stop {{the building of the}} Franklin Dam, and campaigned against the construction of the Bell Bay Pulp Mill. In 2003 Cundall also marched, with thousands of other Australians, in protest against Australia's involvement in the Iraq war. On 19 November 2009, Cundall was arrested by police after refusing to obey requests to move from Tasmanian state parliament's front steps. He was protesting against the Gunns' Bell Bay Pulp Mill. On 3 February 2010, he pleaded not guilty to the charge of refusing to obey a police order to move away from Parliament House. After the court session, he accused Gunns and the politicians who <b>approved</b> the pulp <b>mill</b> of corruption. He was found guilty without conviction and was fined about A$47 in court costs on 11 February 2011. Despite the fine, he vowed to [...] "continue to peacefully protest against Gunns' proposed Tasmanian pulp mill".|$|R
5000|$|Working {{conditions}} at the mill improved with time, because of experienced management and federal worker’s rights legislation. Erwin and Duke originally elected to operate the mill in the South even though most textile mills in the late 1800s were located in the Northeast, because labor in the post-war South was relatively cheap. Employees were originally paid 30 cents an hour, but that number fell to 25 cents shortly after, prompting the mill’s first strike. [...] Child labor was also present, as boys as young as ten years old toiled at the mill until the practice was banned in 1913. In the early 20th century, O.C. Crabtree worked 66 hours {{a week at the}} age of 12. A 40-hour workweek was instated for all workers {{at the turn of the}} century and would remain a staple at the mill until its closure in the 1980s. Workers only worked limited hours at night and Federal legislation in 1913 limited night work to only two hours.Additionally, Erwin instituted a profit sharing and bonus program for all mill workers, something that was rare at a textile mill, especially in the South. Employees at the <b>mill</b> <b>approved</b> of Erwin’s supervision and many knew him on a personal level, as he visited all areas of the factory on a daily or weekly basis.
