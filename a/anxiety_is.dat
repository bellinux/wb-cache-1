5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of <b>anxiety,</b> <b>is</b> a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E
5|$|Following Freud's early speculations about infant {{experience}} with the mother, Otto Rank suggested a powerful role in personality development for birth trauma. Rank stressed the traumatic experience of birth as a separation from the mother, rather than birth as an uncomfortable physical event. Not long after Rank's introduction of this idea, Ian Suttie, a British physician whose early death limited his influence, suggested that the child's basic need is for mother-love, and his greatest <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> that such love will be lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{major theme}} of Buffy's dream is {{her fear of}} the {{personal}} cost of {{her life as a}} Slayer, the isolation and loneliness she is forced to endure. This theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone in the frame, most notably the wide shot of her in the vast and empty desert. Another source of <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> her relationship with her current boyfriend, Riley, whom she finds plotting world domination with Adam in his original, human, form. She fears what Riley could turn into {{as a result of his}} alliance with the military. She also fears the destabilizing effect of this alliance on their relationship, and the destabilizing effect of this relationship on her life as the slayer. She is shown putting mud on her face, mimicking the mud mask of the primal, First Slayer. By the end of her encounter in the desert with the First Slayer, Buffy realizes that she does not have to be entirely alone, that it is her closeness to friends and family that makes her a great Slayer, and once she experiences this revelation, the efforts of the First Slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical. The dream finally ends in a mundane way, as Buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life.|$|E

40|$|EEG {{correlates}} of mathematical and trait <b>anxiety</b> level <b>were</b> studied in 52 healthy Russian-speakers during execution of error-recognition tasks with lexical, arithmetic and algebraic conditions. Event-related spectral perturbations {{were used as}} a measure of brain activity. The ERSP plots revealed alpha/beta desynchronizations within a 500 - 3000 ms interval after task onset and slow-wave synchronization within an interval of 150 - 350 ms. Amplitudes of these intervals reflected the accuracy of error recognition, and were differently associated with the three conditions. The {{correlates of}} <b>anxiety</b> <b>were</b> found in theta (4 - 8 Hz) and beta 2 (16 - 20 Hz) frequency bands. In theta band the effects of mathematical <b>anxiety</b> <b>were</b> stronger expressed inlexical, than in arithmetic and algebraic condition. The mathematicalanxiety effects in theta band were associated with differences between anterior and posterior cortical areas, whereas the effects of trait <b>anxiety</b> <b>were</b> associated with inter-hemispherical differences. In beta 1 and beta 2 bands effects of trait and mathematical <b>anxiety</b> <b>were</b> directed oppositely. The trait <b>anxiety</b> <b>was</b> associated with increase of amplitude of desynchronization, whereas the mathematical <b>anxiety</b> <b>was</b> associated with decrease of this amplitude. The effect of mathematical anxiety in beta 2 band was insignificant for lexical condition but was the strongest in algebraic condition. EEG correlates of anxiety in theta band could be interpreted as indexes of task emotionality, whereas the reaction in beta 2 band is related to tension of intellectual resources...|$|R

25|$|Test <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> the uneasiness, apprehension, or {{nervousness}} felt {{by students}} who have a fear of failing an exam. Students who have test anxiety may experience any of the following: the association of grades with personal worth; fear of embarrassment by a teacher; fear of alienation from parents or friends; time pressures; or feeling a loss of control. Sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, uncontrollable crying or laughing and drumming on a desk are all common. Because test anxiety hinges on fear of negative evaluation, debate exists as to whether test <b>anxiety</b> <b>is</b> itself a unique anxiety disorder {{or whether it is}} a specific type of social phobia. The DSM-IV classifies test anxiety as a type of social phobia.|$|E

25|$|Rebound anxiety, {{more severe}} than {{baseline}} <b>anxiety,</b> <b>is</b> also a common withdrawal symptom when discontinuing diazepam or other benzodiazepines. Diazepam is therefore only recommended for short-term therapy at the lowest possible dose owing to risks of severe withdrawal problems from low doses even after gradual reduction. The risk of pharmacological dependence on diazepam is significant, and patients experience symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome if it is taken for six weeks or longer. In humans, tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam occurs frequently.|$|E

40|$|Journal articleIt {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the disruptive effects of negative emotional states, such as anxiety and depression, may contribute to poorer performance in older age. Some studies have reported that higher levels of <b>anxiety</b> <b>are</b> associated with poorer cognitive performance in older adults but not younger adults. The author examined if age and anxiety interact with performance by comparing the performance of normal healthy younger and older adults on cognitive and motor tests under conditions of selective and divided attention. Ninety-two older adults (mean age= 70. 1 years, SD= 7. 1 years) and 78 younger adults (mean age= 18. 8 years, SD= 1. 9 years), matched on education, vocabulary, and self-reported health, performed a word-comparison and pursuit-rotor task under conditions of selective and divided attention. <b>Anxiety</b> <b>was</b> assessed using the Speilberger State-Trait anxiety scale.

40|$|This article {{originally}} {{appeared in}} the Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy. The version of record is available at Springer via: [URL] study examined the roles of self-focused attention and post-event processing in social performance anxiety and social interaction anxiety. College students (N = 101) completed measures of social performance anxiety, social interaction anxiety, self-focused attention, post-event processing, and beliefs related to social anxiety. Interoceptive self-focused attention and post-event processing predicted social performance anxiety after controlling for social interaction anxiety. The associations with social interaction <b>anxiety</b> <b>were</b> not significant after controlling for social performance anxiety.
