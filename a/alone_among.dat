5|$|Although single western towers {{are common}} in English parish churches, only one medieval cathedral, Ely, retains a {{centrally}} placed western tower, and in that case, it was framed by two lower lateral towers, one of which has since fallen down. Ely, <b>alone</b> <b>among</b> England’s cathedrals, has a central feature over the crossing that somewhat resembles the polygonal vaulted lantern towers of Spain. This elaborate lantern-like structure known as “The Octagon” spans both the nave and aisles, and is thus said to have inspired Christopher Wren’s design for the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral. Its upper parts are supported by hidden wooden hammer-beams, an architectural device unique to English Gothic.|$|E
5|$|Government {{publications}} on {{the dangers}} of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology. The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, seeing them as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, {{in large part because of}} public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, <b>alone</b> <b>among</b> new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services.|$|E

5|$|Kenyatta had {{continued}} writing articles, {{in which he}} reflected Padmore's influence. He produced an article for a January 1933 issue of the Negro Worker, and then another for a November 1933 issue of Labour Monthly. He also wrote the entry on Kenya for Negro, an anthology edited by Nancy Cunard and published in 1934. In these, he took a more extreme position than {{he had in the}} past, calling for complete self-rule in Kenya. In doing so he was virtually <b>alone</b> <b>among</b> political Kenyans, with figures like Thuku and Jesse Kariuki being far less radical in their demands.

5|$|Some {{historians are}} {{convinced}} that by 1964 Mikoyan believed that Khrushchev {{had turned into a}} liability to the Party, and that he was involved in the October 1964 coup that brought Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin to power. However, William Taubman disputes this, as Mikoyan was {{the only member of the}} Presidium (the name for the Politburo at this time) to defend Khrushchev. Mikoyan, however, did vote to force Khrushchev's retirement (so as, in traditional Soviet style, to make the vote unanimous). <b>Alone</b> <b>among</b> Khrushchev's colleagues, Mikoyan wished the former leader well in his retirement, though he never spoke to him again. Mikoyan laid a wreath and sent a letter of condolence at Khrushchev's funeral in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Study of Saturn's moons {{has also}} been aided by {{advances}} in telescope instrumentation, primarily the introduction of digital charge-coupled devices which replaced photographic plates. For the entire 20th century, Phoebe stood <b>alone</b> <b>among</b> Saturn's known moons with its highly irregular orbit. Beginning in 2000, however, three dozen additional irregular moons have been discovered using ground-based telescopes. A survey starting in late 2000 and conducted using three medium-size telescopes found thirteen new moons orbiting Saturn at a great distance, in eccentric orbits, which are highly inclined to both the equator of Saturn and the ecliptic. They are probably fragments of larger bodies captured by Saturn's gravitational pull. In 2005, astronomers using the Mauna Kea Observatory announced the discovery of twelve more small outer moons, in 2006, astronomers using the Subaru 8.2m telescope reported the discovery of nine more irregular moons, in , Tarqeq (S/2007 S 1) was announced and in May {{of the same year}} S/2007 S 2 and S/2007 S 3 were reported.|$|E

5|$|The {{extraordinary}} initial {{success of}} Pinafore in America was seen first-hand by J. C. Williamson. He soon made arrangements with D'Oyly Carte {{to present the}} opera's first authorised production in Australia, opening on 15 November 1879 at the Theatre Royal, Sydney. Thereafter, his opera company played frequent seasons of the work (and the subsequent Savoy operas) until at least 1963. In the U.S., the piece never lost popularity. The Internet Broadway Database links to a non-exhaustive list of 29 productions on Broadway <b>alone.</b> <b>Among</b> the professional repertory companies continuing to present Pinafore regularly in the U.S. are Opera a la Carte, based in California, Ohio Light Opera and the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players, which tours the opera annually and often includes it in its New York seasons.
