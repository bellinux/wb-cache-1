Both <b>Gs</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Gs</b> 2 had high sequence similarity to germin, a protein that increases significantly in germinating wheat seeds. Like germin, <b>Gs</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Gs</b> 2 were resistant to proteases and were glycosylated. Immunoblots were probed with antibodies to <b>Gs</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Gs</b> 2 {{to determine the}} distribution of these polypeptides among organs <b>and</b> cell-free fractions. <b>Gs</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Gs</b> 2 were present in roots and coleoptiles, but absent from leaves. In roots, <b>Gs</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Gs</b> 2 {{were present in the}} mature region, but not the tip. <b>Gs</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Gs</b> 2 increased in roots, but decreased in coleoptiles in response to salt stress. <b>Gs</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Gs</b> 2 were distributed among the soluble, microsomal, and cell wall fractions of roots, but the majority of <b>Gs</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Gs</b> 2 was present in the soluble fraction.

40|$|Summary The {{roles of}} {{temperature}} (T) and leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in regulating net photosynthesis (Anet) <b>and</b> stomatal conductance (<b>Gs)</b> of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) were investigated {{in a field}} study and in a controlled environment experiment. Both Anet <b>and</b> <b>Gs</b> exhibited a rela-tively flat response to temperatures between 16 and 32 C. Temperatures between 32 and 36 C markedly decreased both Anet <b>and</b> <b>Gs.</b> Vapor pressure deficits above 2 kPa had significant effects on both Anet <b>and</b> <b>Gs.</b> The influence of VPD on Anet <b>and</b> <b>Gs</b> fit a linear response model and did not interact significantly with T effects...|$|R
30|$|Theoretical {{assessments}} {{of the role of}} stomatal regulation on hydraulic conductance revealed a positive, linear relationship between <b>gs</b> <b>and</b> Kl if the whole-plant water pressure gradient and D between the leaf and air remain similar (Sperry et al. 1993; Oren et al. 1999). Given that the species studied here had similar Ψmin and D, the close relationship between Kl <b>and</b> <b>gs</b> found was consistent with previous studies in other ecosystems (Hubbard et al. 2001; Santiago et al. 2004). Interestingly, the Klnoon was not significantly correlated with gs; similarly, Santiago et al. (2004) reported that the correlation coefficient between Kinit <b>and</b> <b>gs</b> was lower than that between Klmax <b>and</b> <b>gs.</b> The absence of correlation between Klnoon <b>and</b> <b>gs</b> could have many explanations. For example, leaf capacity may decouple the relationship between Klnoon <b>and</b> <b>gs.</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceYttrium oxide and {{gadolinium}} oxide modified platinum nanoparticles supported on carbon (Vulcan XC- 72), noted as Pt-M 2 O 3 /C (M=Y <b>and</b> <b>Gd),</b> were synthesized by water-in-oil nanoemulsion chemical route, followed by heat treatment at 100 and 300 degrees C under hydrogen/nitrogen (H- 2 /N- 2) atmosphere and tested as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). As revealed by powder X-ray diffraction analysis, all obtained catalysts showed solely Pt face-centered-cubic structure, and {{absence of a}} secondary phase before and after heat treatments, indicating that Y 2 O 3 <b>and</b> <b>Gd</b> 2 O 3 are highly disordered (amorphous) and dispersed clusters. The surface Pt:M ratio (M=Y <b>and</b> <b>Gd),</b> as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, increased after heat treatment {{with respect to the}} value of as-prepared samples, for which the ratio was 1 : 1. Microstrain data extracted from Williamson-Hall plots for Pt-M 2 O 3 /C (M=Y <b>and</b> <b>Gd)</b> catalysts surprisingly increased after heat treatment at 100 degrees C, remaining nearly constant after heat treatment at 300 degrees C, whereas the value of pure Pt nanoparticles, noted as Pt/C, decreased after heat treatments. The mean particle size derived from TEM images for Pt-M 2 O 3 /C (M=Y <b>and</b> <b>Gd)</b> was almost unchanged after heat treatments, at variance with the Pt/C case where a clear increase is observed. Surface specific activity and mass activity towards ORR obtained with as-prepared Pt-M 2 O 3 /C (M=Y <b>and</b> <b>Gd)</b> catalysts were higher than those of as-prepared Pt/C catalyst. After heat treatment, the ORR activity of Pt-M 2 O 3 /C (M=Y <b>and</b> <b>Gd)</b> augmented, whereas that of Pt/C diminished. Moreover, after 6000 cycles between 0. 5 and 0. 95 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), Pt-M 2 O 3 /C (M=Y <b>and</b> <b>Gd)</b> catalysts retained a large active surface area and a high kinetic current density at 0. 9 V vs. RHE in comparison with Pt/C samples.

In the mid-twentieth century, two separate forms were recognised, Gorgon taurinus hecki <b>and</b> <b>G.</b> t. albojubatus. Finally two distinct types of wildebeest – the blue and black wildebeest – were identified. The blue wildebeest was at first placed under a separate genus, Gorgon, while the black wildebeest belonged to the genus Connochaetes. Today they are united in the single genus Connochaetes: the black wildebeest being named (C. gnou) and the blue wildebeest, (C. taurinus).|$|E
