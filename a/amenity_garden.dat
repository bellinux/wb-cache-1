50|$|The {{restoration}} of the designed landscape have been greatly influenced by a comprehensive analysis of available archive material, among which are the original written memoranda and sketches produced by Richard Woods for his site forman Thomas Coalie. An integrated archaeological programme also formed a key aspect of the restorations, recording in detail landscape features such as the Rock Arch, Cascade, and Bridge. This restoration has not 'recreated' the 18th century scheme, although elements are still incorporated within a 'living' <b>amenity</b> <b>garden</b> that is now thriving {{as a result of}} the recent work undertaken in partnership with the Friends of Cusworth Park.|$|E

It shows an idealised arrangement with individual cells for monks, workshops, <b>amenities,</b> <b>gardens,</b> stables and a school. It constitutes a living space for a completely self-sufficient community. Natural constraints such as the building site, the close proximity of town buildings, and lack of funds meant that in practice few monasteries were so lavishly constructed during the Romanesque period. From the 10th century, the great Abbey of Cluny set a standard of building and amenities {{that was to be}} emulated by others.|$|R

2500|$|In Adelaide, South Australia (a city of 1.3 million), Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) {{launched}} a major urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native {{trees and shrubs}} by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area. [...] The projects range from large habitat restoration projects to small <b>amenity</b> <b>gardens</b> and local biodiversity projects. Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated on well publicised community planting days. Sites include parks, reserves, transport corridors, schools, water courses, coastline [...] council land and other public open space. Only indigenous trees and shrubs native to the particular local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity. Premier Rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city {{and make it more}} liveable; improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide's greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tonnes of C02 a year. He said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for precious wildlife and preventing species loss.|$|R

50|$|Nevertheless, many {{refugees}} established such <b>amenities</b> as <b>gardens</b> {{and coffee}} houses. Informal social networks provided {{some degree of}} support, especially for women. The more fortunate in the camp were able to trade items sent to them by family or friends from outside. Despite such apparent comforts, the boredom and uncertainty, as well as normal rivalries and tensions common to any small town, put an undertone of unhappiness into camp life. Disturbances occurred within the camp from time to time, and in 1994 there was prolonged rioting amongst discontented detainees.|$|R

50|$|A generous {{gift from}} Lora and Claiborne Robins {{provided}} an important new <b>amenity</b> for the <b>Garden,</b> the Lora and Claiborne Robins Tea House. Expanding upon a small {{representation of a}} Japanese Tea House and a Zen Garden in the master plan, the building, designed by James Irby and Associates, was completed in November 1993. Providing full-service dining, the restaurant boasted a spectacular view {{of the lake and}} the perimeter of the Flagler Garden. After Mr. Robins’s death in July 1995, Mrs. Robins provided a further gift for designing The Asian Valley, a garden to house a collection of plants derived from the flora of east Asia, to honor the memory of her husband. Osamu Shimizu, a well-known Washington, D.C. area garden designer and native of Japan, was commissioned for the job.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the passing}} of the Municipal Institutions Act 1864 the area could {{establish}} a municipal council to administer the district - with powers relating to by-laws, to rating, to borrowings, to the control or regulation of public infrastructure and utilities, and to the provision of public <b>amenities</b> such as <b>gardens</b> and hospitals. The council was led by a mayor and the role was generally rotated among the aldermen. Thus many mayors served for only one year and some served multiple times some years apart. The council [...] "year" [...] commenced and ended in about February to avoid a change-over during the summer holidays, so the mayor for 1890 would, strictly speaking, be the mayor into early 1891. Most of the early aldermen and mayors of the Municipality of Brisbane were prominent local men rather than representatives of political parties.|$|R
40|$|Crandon Park is one {{of seven}} {{heritage}} parks acquired by Miami-Dade County. The park sits on a barrier island, with two miles of beach to the east, and Biscayne Bay to the west.

50|$|The {{southern}} {{boundary of}} the Temple liberties was the natural bank of the River Thames until the Victoria Embankment was constructed (1865-1870). The {{boundary of the}} Temple liberties remained fixed despite this notable engineering work, which meant that the Inner and Middle Temple lost their frontage to the Thames replacing that <b>amenity</b> chiefly with <b>gardens.</b> (The boundaries of the Inner and Middle Temple liberties have not changed in centuries, although both now own properties just beyond their liberties' boundary.) The Victoria Embankment (which is a major thoroughfare with an Underground line running beneath) does not therefore form part of the Inner or Middle Temple - the southern boundary today runs along the boundary fence where the Temple gardens meets the Victoria Embankment road, more or less where the original bank of the Thames used to be. The City of London's southern boundary {{on the other hand}} runs along the centre of the Thames itself.|$|R
50|$|The estate {{property}} originally {{consisted of}} 180 acre of shoreline Mangrove swamps and dense inland native tropical forests. Being a conservationist, Deering sited {{the development of}} the estate portion along the shore to conserve the forests. This portion was to include the villa, formal <b>gardens,</b> recreational <b>amenities,</b> expansive lagoon <b>gardens</b> with new islets, potager and grazing fields, and a village services compound. The villa was built primarily between 1914 and 1922, while the construction of the extensive elaborate Italian Renaissance gardens and the village continued into 1923. During the World War I years building trades and supplies were difficult to acquire in Florida. Vizcaya is noteworthy for adapting historical European aesthetic traditions to South Florida's subtropical ecoregion. For example; it combined imported French and Italian garden layouts and elements implemented in Cuban limestone stonework with Floridian coral architectural trim and planted with sub-tropic compatible and native plants that thrived in the habitat and climate. Palms and Philodendrons had not been represented in the emulated gardens of Tuscany or Île-de-France.|$|R
50|$|To {{facilitate}} food production, {{cities have}} established community-based farming projects. Some projects have collectively tended community farms on common land, {{much like that}} of eighteenth-century Boston Common. One such community farm is the Collingwood Children's Farm in Melbourne, Australia. Other community garden projects use the allotment garden model, in which gardeners care for individual plots in a larger gardening area, often sharing a tool shed and other <b>amenities.</b> Seattle's P-Patch <b>gardens</b> use this model, as did the South Central Farm in Los Angeles and the Food Roof Farm in St. Louis. Independent urban gardeners also grow food in individual yards and on roofs. Garden sharing projects seek to pair producers with land, typically, residential yard space. Roof gardens allow for urban dwellers to maintain green spaces in the city without having to set aside a tract of undeveloped land. Rooftop farms allow otherwise unused industrial roofspace to be used productively, creating work and profit. Projects around the world seek to enable cities to become 'continuous productive landscapes' by cultivating vacant urban land and temporary or permanent kitchen gardens.|$|R
40|$|Cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) have {{experienced}} rapid uncontrolled urbanism {{due to the}} absence of robust planning measures. This causes lack or ill distributions of facilities and segregation between these facilities and the residences in districts and neighbourhoods across the King-dom. It also encouraged citizens to adopt unhealthy lifestyles which in turn aggravated their health conditions. This paper discusses the critical relationship between the unhealthy lifestyle of diabetic patients and the proximity of public gardens. A survey on 76 diabetic patients and their living conditions was carried out. A visual and mapping survey was conducted on public gardens and vacant lands around diabetics’ homes. The study found that cities in the Eastern province, KSA have unhealthy urban and suburban settings in terms of the proximity and characteristics of public gardens. It is revealed that patients have unhealthier lifestyle and frequent diabetic symptoms when gardens are far away and vacant lands are nearer to their homes. This calls the need for emergent amendment of the present planning regulations for the use of vacant lands and public <b>amenities</b> including public <b>gardens</b> in Saudi cities so they would help improving the physical, psychological and spiritual health of the diabetic patients and the community...|$|R
40|$|Moles are {{considered}} pests in Britain, but {{this issue has}} been little studied. Lower welfare standards have been tolerated for moles than for most other managed wild mammal species, as use of both the controversial poison, strychnine, and unregulated traps have been permitted. Strychnine was withdrawn in 2006 and there were fears that mole populations would increase as a result. In 2007, we conducted a comprehensive, nationwide survey of land manager perceptions, opinions and behaviour regarding moles and mole control on farms, <b>amenities</b> and domestic <b>gardens</b> in Britain. We surveyed 2, 150 land managers (achieving a 59 % response rate) and ground-truthed 29 responses. Moles were reported to be present on most farms and amenities, and 13 % of gardens, and were more common on lighter soils. Where present, moles were usually considered pests, this being more likely in Wales, Scotland and northern England, on livestock and mixed farms, and on large, high-value amenities, e. g., racecourses and golf courses. Mole control followed similar patterns to mole presence. More control may occur than is economically, and therefore potentially ethically, justified. Control should be more carefully considered and, where necessary, more effectively targeted. Kill-trapping was the favoured recent and future method on farms and amenities, even if strychnine was to be reintroduced; however, because mole traps are currently unregulated, some might not meet current welfare standards if tested. We found no evidence {{for an increase in}} moles since a farm questionnaire survey conducted in 1992; this could have wider implications for future wildlife management policy changes...|$|R
60|$|When we were {{opposite}} {{to the middle}} of Billerica, the fields on either hand had a soft and cultivated English aspect, the village spire being seen over the copses which skirt the river, and sometimes an orchard straggled down to the water-side, though, generally, our course this forenoon was the wildest part of our voyage. It seemed that men led a quiet and very civil life there. The inhabitants were plainly cultivators of the earth, and lived under an organized political government. The school-house stood with a meek aspect, entreating a long truce to war and savage life. Every one finds by his own experience, as well as in history, that the era in which men cultivate the apple, and the <b>amenities</b> of the <b>garden,</b> is essentially {{different from that of the}} hunter and forest life, and neither can displace the other without loss. We have all had our day-dreams, as well as more prophetic nocturnal vision; but as for farming, I am convinced that my genius dates from an older era than the agricultural. I would at least strike my spade into the earth with such careless freedom but accuracy as the woodpecker his bill into a tree. There is in my nature, methinks, a singular yearning toward all wildness. I know of no redeeming qualities in myself but a sincere love for some things, and when I am reproved I fall back on to this ground. What have I to do with ploughs? I cut another furrow than you see. Where the off ox treads, there is it not, it is farther off; where the nigh ox walks, it will not be, it is nigher still. If corn fails, my crop fails not, and what are drought and rain to me? The rude Saxon pioneer will sometimes pine for that refinement and artificial beauty which are English, and love to hear the sound of such sweet and classical names as the Pentland and Malvern Hills, the Cliffs of Dover and the Trosachs, Richmond, Derwent, and Winandermere, which are to him now instead of the Acropolis and Parthenon, of Baiae, and Athens with its sea-walls, and Arcadia and Tempe.|$|R
