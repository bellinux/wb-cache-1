25|$|In {{addition}} to freeway construction, ODOT, {{along with the}} Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) {{and the city of}} Columbus <b>are</b> <b>discussing</b> the possibility of several freeway caps over portions of I-70 and I-71. These caps, similar to the one built on High Street over I-670, would be widened overpasses, creating a seamless transition between neighborhoods by adding businesses or parks to either side of the current overpass. While this will add considerable cost to the project, it is hoped that the freeway caps will link neighborhoods that were divided when the interstate highway system was put in. Twelve overpasses were originally looked at for freeway caps, though the list has been narrowed to six due to budget constraints. Each cap would cost anywhere between $2million and $12million depending on the complexity, and a total of $53million to $62million could be added to the project if all six are built. The Ohio Department of Transportation has pledged $10million toward caps, $37million for streetscape improvements in total, and the MORPC has pledged another $12million for the caps. With the caps and other streetscape improvements added to the project, total project cost is expected to reach $1billion.|$|E
