50|$|The {{company was}} formed in 2005 {{with the purpose of}} {{operating}} turboprop commuter aircraft. The initial fleet consisted of 1 Cessna Grand Caravan aircraft and 3 Beechcraft 1900C aircraft. CemAir has since evolved into a specialised aircraft leasing company offering turboprop and jet aircraft to a variety of operators throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the Indian Ocean islands as well as a significant operator of scheduled regional services within South Africa. The company is a South African Part 121 (large <b>aircraft</b> <b>operator)</b> and Part 135 (small <b>aircraft</b> <b>operator)</b> company, <b>holding</b> South African Civil Aviation Authority issued AOCs (Air Operator Certificates) in both of these categories. The Air Service Licensing Council has issued the company with domestic and international licenses, for both scheduled and non-scheduled services. In addition, CemAir holds approval from the SACAA for a Part 145 AMO (Approved Maintenance Organisation), which allows it to operate its own maintenance department. The management structure conforms to the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) model and has six full-time post holders for complete oversight of flight operations and maintenance. The duties and responsibilities of each position are documented with frequent internal and external audits to ensure compliance.The organisation runs an ICAO based Safety Management System (SMS) conforming to the requirements of ICAO Safety Management Standards & Recommended Practises (SARPs) and ICAO Doc 9859.The company was previously a member of the Flight Safety Foundation and completed three successive BARS audits. BARS (Basic Aviation Risk Standard) is a move towards audit standardization using a risk-based model based on best practice aviation safety principles and tailored {{to the needs of the}} resource sector, mainly the mining industry. Two additional resource based audits have been successfully concluded by Hart Aviation to ensure that CemAir's operating and maintenance standards are acceptable to companies in the oil, gas and petroleum industry. The company has recently concluded its first IOSA audit (IATA Operational Safety Audit)and expects full accreditation to be achieved by mid-2016.|$|R
