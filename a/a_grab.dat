5|$|The series offers combo-based combat, and {{includes}} a quick time event (QTE) feature, also called context sensitive attacks, which is initiated when the player has weakened a foe. It allows limited control of Kratos during the QTE cinematic sequence; success ends the battle, while failure usually results in damage to the player. As well as the QTE system, Ascension features a prompt-less free-form system, allowing players the choice of when to attack or dodge based on the enemy's actions. <b>A</b> <b>grab</b> maneuver {{can be used on}} minor foes.|$|E
5|$|Waste {{arriving}} at the plant is checked in and weighed, before being delivered to the plant's reception hall. The large reception hall allows the vehicles to dump their waste safely. Air for the combustion of the waste later in the plant is drawn from the reception hall so that odour and dust doesn't pollute the building's surroundings. From the hall waste is tipped into a large concrete bunker. Here the feedstock is homogenefied by a crane operator, who mixes and removes unsuitable waste. <b>A</b> <b>grab</b> crane then manoeuvers waste from the bunker to the hoppers that feed the furnace. This crane is operated from a control room. This room also monitors the equipment in the plant, the combustion gases and maximises {{the efficiency of the}} plant.|$|E
5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} in the Tony Hawk's series, Underground {{is centered on}} skateboarding {{in a series of}} levels. The player performs tricks via combinations of analog stick and button inputs. For example, the player initiates an ollie (a jump trick) by holding and releasing the jump button. During an ollie, the player may change the position of the analog stick and press one of two buttons to perform either a flip trick (such as an impossible or kickflip) or <b>a</b> <b>grab</b> trick (such as a benihana or nosegrab). The player can grind on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during a grind based on the position of the analog stick. On quarter pipes, the player may execute lip tricks. While skating on flat surfaces, the player may manual in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include acid drops and wall-rides.|$|E

The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk the following year ended the war between Germany and Soviet Russia and left the Baltic region firmly in German hands.

500|$|The A.V. Club writer Sean O'Neal said [...] "201" [...] was an {{improvement}} over [...] "200", but nevertheless felt [...] "201" [...] was [...] "less a cohesive episode than <b>a</b> <b>grab</b> bag of balls-out crazy scenes and cameos only loyal fans would really appreciate." [...] However, he also said, [...] "it's sure to become one of, if not the most talked-about episode of South Park ever." [...] Even after Comedy Central announced they {{were responsible for the}} censorship in [...] "201", he speculated as to whether it was possibly a publicity stunt by Parker and Stone to create controversy and increase viewership. Ramsey Isler of IGN said the episode built on the events of [...] "200" [...] and delivered a strong payoff, particularly with the subplot about Cartman's father and the way it tied back to [...] "Scott Tenorman Must Die". Isler said the bleeps added by Comedy Central provided some unintentional laughs and underscored the episode's underlying theme opposing censorship.|$|E

50|$|The {{game is a}} clone of Defender. The player {{controls}} an X15 spacecraft, protecting canisters {{from the}} hostile Reeg forces.

The player must shoot the enemy ship to release <b>a</b> <b>grabbed</b> canister, but if it falls too far, then it's destroyed on impact. There are also other ships such as cruisers, which when hit, unleash buzzer ships.|$|R
500|$|The Boston Globes Sarah Rodman {{wrote that}} the song is moody but far too {{deliberate}} and [...] "has <b>a</b> <b>grab</b> bag of evocative images but never quite jells".

Andy Jill of The Independent stated that [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] have [...] "inflammatory" [...] titles. Entertainment Weekly's Simon Vozick-Levinson wrote that although Rihanna took risk with releasing the song, it pays off, [...] "Rihanna is in fine vocal form throughout, and Ne-Yo's songwriting is economical and evocative per usual." [...] A staff from MTV Newsroom thought that the single retains some sort of attitude and atmosphere that made Rihanna [...] "such a definitive artist".

2500|$|Seeking to musically express Raekwon's {{blend of}} Five Percenter creed and inner-city experience, {{producer}} RZA worked intensively on a polished sound, slower and more layered {{than that of}} Wu-Tang's previous efforts, using strings, piano loops and vocal samples from Kung Fu movies, and Mafia films. Due to Raekwon's storytelling, mobster-minded approach, the producer set up Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... to play like scenes in a crime movie. RZA has cited soul musician Isaac Hayes as an influence on his orchestral approach to several of the album's tracks. He also later revealed {{that several of the}} album's beats, such as [...] "Incarcerated Scarfaces," [...] were originally intended for Wu-Tang member GZA's Liquid Swords album, but because of Raekwon's timely writing approach, were used last minute for Cuban Linx. In regard to this, Raekwon clarified [...] "RZA's house was more or less like a candy store. You come in and have all kinds of shit to choose from. I would take stuff that I felt would suit my album correctly; others would take their own beats too. The beats were like <b>a</b> <b>grab</b> bag. If I came in and heard a beat that someone already claimed, then I just had to fall back. We almost never fought over beats or nothing. I'd tell RZA if I liked a certain beat, and he'd see if it would fit me or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} season saw improvements {{for both}} teams, from Miami's acquisition of Ray Allen and Chris Andersen, {{to the emergence}} of Paul George and Lance Stephenson. Notably, it was after the Heat lost to the Pacers that they compiled a 27-game winning streak; the last time the Heat lost two in a row in the year were the games against Indiana and Portland. During the waning minutes of Game 6 in the Semifinals between the Pacers and the New York Knicks, the Pacers' fans were chanting [...] "Beat The Heat" [...] as their team beat their old New York rivals. True to form, the Heat and the Pacers met in the Conference Finals of the 2013 NBA Playoffs on May 22, 2013. Several instances of physicality became prominent in the series: Shane Battier received an offensive foul for throwing his knee at Hibbert's midsection; Hibbert claimed that it was intentional dirty play on the part of Battier. Andersen suffered a bloodied nose after colliding with David West. Ian Mahinmi received a retroactive flagrant foul for <b>a</b> <b>grab</b> of James' arm. Norris Cole latched a hand on West's groin area as he tried to slip through West. Wade received a retroactive flagrant foul for hitting Stephenson in the head, another incident that the Pacers, notably Paul George, felt was a dirty play. The Heat survived Game 1 on a James game-winning layup, while the Pacers came back to tie the series at 1–1 after forcing James into two late fourth-quarter turnovers for Game 2. In Game 3, the Heat set a team record for points in a postseason half with 70. It {{was the first time the}} Pacers had given up 70 points since 1992. Allen's single turnover was the least ever suffered by the Heat in a first half. Their five total turnovers is tied for the fewest in franchise history. The Game 3 victory marked the first time that an NBA team had won five straight road games by double digits. The Heat won the series 4–3, with a 99–76 win in game 7. In 2014, the Pacers and Heat renewed their rivalry in a second consecutive East Finals match up with the Heat eliminating the Pacers again.|$|E

The Heat would go on to eliminate the Pacers 4–2 games, advancing to their fourth consecutive NBA Finals in the Big Three-era. The Heat stumbled during Game 1 in Indianapolis, falling 96–107. They would win Games 2–4. During Game 5 (which Miami lost 90–93), James struggled, suffering heavy foul trouble and scoring only 7 points, his lowest Playoff record. During Game 6 in Miami, the Heat would blow out the Pacers 117–92.|$|E
