5|$|Strong {{was born}} on 13 February 1880 in Ramsgate, Kent, England, to William R. Strong (1846–1899) and Charlotte E. Strong née Stock (1850–1923). Like many golfers from his era, he was first {{introduced}} to golf via his participation as a caddie when he toted bags at Royal St George's Golf Club located in Sandwich, England, in the mid-1890s. In 1905 he emigrated to the United States, departing Liverpool on 14 June 1905 aboard the RMS Teutonic which arrived in New York on 22 June 1905 with $400 in his pocket, <b>a</b> <b>hefty</b> sum at the time.|$|E

It became the most-watched film {{on television in}} Taiwan, having attracted an audience of almost 3 million people. In the 15 to 44 years old audience, it had an average rating of 7.14, with the rating peaking at 9.27 during the screening. It was also the most-watched television program on both cable and free-to-air networks in Taiwan. STAR Chinese Movies reportedly purchased the rights to this film at <b>a</b> <b>hefty</b> price of NT$2 million (approx. US$69,000).|$|E

50|$|The {{budget for}} this version was quite small {{compared}} to the English-speaking version of the show. Few (if any) cars were offered, {{and the value of}} the Big Deal (El Gran Trato) usually ranged from $3,000 to $6,000. However, a few nighttime specials of Trato Hecho were produced with <b>a</b> <b>heftier</b> budget; the Big Deal could be worth up to $26,000 on these episodes.|$|R
5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with <b>a</b> <b>hefty</b> $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E

5000|$|The same logic {{applies to}} major {{consumer}} purchases. A [...] "green mortgage" [...] {{such as a}} Location Efficient Mortgage, for example, recognizes that persons who do not drive cars and live generally energy-efficient lifestyles pay far less per month than others and accordingly have more to pay <b>a</b> <b>heftier</b> mortgage bill with. This justifies lending them much more money to upgrade a house to use even less energy overall. The result is a bank taking more per month from a consumer's income as utilities and car insurance companies take less, and housing stock upgraded to use the minimum energy feasible with current technology.|$|R

His son William Edwin Hamilton brought the Elements of Quaternions, <b>a</b> <b>hefty</b> volume of 762 pages, to publication in 1866. As copies ran short, a second edition was prepared by Charles Jasper Joly, when the book was split into two volumes, the first appearing 1899 and the second in 1901. The subject index and footnotes in this second edition improved the Elements accessibility.|$|E

The leasehold was purchased in April 1997 by Schroders Property for $106 million. The acquisition was structured as a 50-50 joint venture between the Schroders Property Fund and the unlisted Schroders Private Property Syndicate.|$|E
50|$|The SP-8 {{does have}} critics, though. Many criticize the SP-8 for {{performing}} {{exactly the same}} way as an Ion, but for <b>a</b> <b>heftier</b> price tag (typically 50% greater than a stock Ion). Also, the Mil-Sim body, while appealing to scenario players, is often regarded as too large and cumbersome to be used in speedball. One minor design flaw is that a compressed air tank cannot be attached directly to the SP-8 while the collapsible stock is also attached. A remote line or drop forward must be used to remedy this. Note that a compressed air (HPA) tank can be attached when the collapsible stock is not mounted; the SP-8 comes with a buttcap to replace the stock.|$|R

50|$|The {{ride height}} is 20 mm {{lower than the}} {{standard}} Golf. Golf R models equipped with the optional 'DCC' (Dynamic Chassis Control), offer 3 suspension modes: 'Comfort', 'Normal', and 'Race'. Each mode adjusts the stiffness of the suspension damping, thereby offering drivers a way {{to change the way}} the vehicle responds by the push of a button. Comfort mode places the dampers in the softest setting, increasing the absorption of road imperfections allowing for a smoother and more comfortable ride. Race mode stiffens the dampers to their most aggressive setting, reducing body movements and increasing adhesion to the road for more precise high speed driving. Race mode also increases throttle response, firms up the steering for <b>a</b> <b>heftier</b> feel, and alters the shift pattern of the DSG gearbox (where fitted) as well as increases the speed of the Adaptive headlamps (AFS) response time.|$|R
25|$|The {{mail fraud}} charges stemmed from what {{prosecutors}} {{described as a}} six-year scheme to dupe thousands of his followers by asking for donations. Using the postal service, Duke appealed to his supporters for funds by fraudulently stating {{he was about to}} lose his house and his life savings. Prosecutors alleged that Duke raised {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} in this scheme. Prosecutors also stipulated that in contrast to what he stated in the mailings, he sold his home at <b>a</b> <b>hefty</b> profit, had multiple investment accounts, and spent much of his money gambling at casinos.|$|E
25|$|Tested at 9.7 {{seconds to}} 100km/h for the manual model, {{it is more}} than half a second slower than its predecessor. This is likely on account of its weight, <b>a</b> <b>hefty</b> 1300kg, which is curiously more than the Civic unlike before wherein it was usually lighter. The {{automatic}} also has widely spaced ratios {{due to the lack of}} a fifth gear, giving sluggish acceleration, definitely not maximizing the engine potential. The Toyota Corolla received a 4 star ANCAP safety rating for occupant safety and a 3 star rating for pedestrian safety.|$|E
25|$|Many {{businesses}} in South Bay offer Mexican car insurance on a short-term, prepaid basis. Most large car rental companies in San Diego do permit their vehicles {{to be taken}} across the border but generally require <b>a</b> <b>hefty</b> fee, sometimes costing more than the rental, for Mexican auto insurance. Visitors to the region should note that automobile insurance does not travel across the international border.

5000|$|The {{first five}} contestants {{eliminated}} from the finals were all female contestants, and this early elimination of females led to criticism of bias against women. Idol producer Ken Warwick said, [...] "It's no secret that most reality shows are female driven, either by moms or by young girls. It does mean we're going to get <b>a</b> <b>heftier</b> amount of female votes and it's always bent towards the boys, obviously, we are very much aware that the voting can be skewed towards the boys." [...] The voting also provoked considerable criticism after the last of these five females, Pia Toscano, a presumed front-runner, was surprisingly eliminated in ninth place. In response to criticism, the producers considered tweaking the voting format for the next season. However, after Toscano's elimination, the next five eliminated contestants were all males, leading to the first Top 3 with two females since the sixth season.|$|R
25|$|An {{independent}} thinker {{and committed}} individualist, characterized by moral intransigence, a lucid critic {{of his era}} and of his country's negative aspects, Philippide refused to be pigeonholed into a single ideological current, thus occupying a rare position for the time. His original thought combined tendencies normally thought of as contradictory: to his Junimist foundations were added small portions of socialist-tinted humanitarianism and Sămănătorist-Poporanist nationalism, as well as <b>a</b> <b>hefty</b> dose of German notions. Nevertheless, {{in the view of}} literary critic Antonio Patraș, they managed to form a coherent and compelling whole, lending scientific but also moral authority to his writings.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the Goryeo and Joseon periods, kisaeng {{held the}} status of cheonmin, the lowest in society. They shared this status with other entertainers, as well as butchers and slaves. Status was hereditary, so the {{children}} of a kisaeng were also of cheonmin status, and daughters automatically became kisaeng as well. Beginning in the Goryeo period, the governing offices in each district kept a registry of kisaeng, to ensure thorough oversight. The same practice was followed for conscripted slaves. Kisaeng could only be released from their position if <b>a</b> <b>hefty</b> price was paid to the government; this could only be done by a wealthy patron, typically a high government official.|$|E

50|$|A fine is to {{be imposed}} when damage is done to another; {{the amount of the}} fine is {{dependent}} on many factors. In the ancient Hindu tradition, it was generally accepted that if a Kshatriya, a Vaishya, or a Shudra was not able to repay the fine, then the offender was made to perform manual labor. However, it was expected that Brahmins would pay the fine in installments. The last resort was to imprison the offender if the offender could not perform manual labor. Presently, any offender may repay the fine in installments, but there cannot be more than three planned installments. According to the ancient Indians, the King must pay <b>a</b> <b>heftier</b> fine for committing a crime. This was thought because he was the prosecutor of his subjects, and therefore, he was also an example for his subjects. In accordance with this idea, the King was made to pay 1,000 Karshapanas when a common man would be fined just one Karshapana.|$|R
40|$|Traditional wisdom {{suggests}} {{those who}} lose at trial for a criminal charge receive <b>a</b> <b>heftier</b> prison sentence {{than those who}} plea bargain. Plea bargaining reduces strain on the courts, expedites adjudication and may indicate the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s propensity for rehabilitation as they accept responsibility for their actions. Some ask why two people charged with the same crime should receive different sentences based on the adjudication method. The Constitution guarantees {{the right to a}} jury trial. Innocent defendants may decide to plead guilty for a sure short sentence rather than risk a trial conviction 2 ̆ 7 s lengthier one. This study using statistical procedures examined 12, 786 adjudicated drug crime cases between 2004 and 2007 from the Cook County Circuit Court in Illinois.
