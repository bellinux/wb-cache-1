5|$|French chemist Bernard Courtois {{discovered}} Iodine in 1811, and in 1896 Eugen Baumann documented it as {{the central}} ingredient in the thryoid gland. He did this by boiling the thyroid glands of a thousand sheep, and named the precipitate, <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thyroid hormones, 'iodothyrin'. David Marine in 1907 provided iodine is necessary for thyroid function. Thyroxine itself was first isolated in 1914 and synthesized in 1927, and trirodothyroxine in 1952. The conversion of T4 to T3 was discovered in 1970. The process of discovering TSH took place over the early to mid twentieth century.

For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He argued that all the differences between humans and apes were explained by <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains, and sexual selection.
