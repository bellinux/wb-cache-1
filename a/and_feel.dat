5|$|Forman {{based his}} story on a {{real-world}} incident {{from his past}} and the filmmakers focused much of their attention on {{trying to create a}} real-life look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> by filming on location in a small Czech town with a shoe factory of its own, utilizing a largely non-professional cast, relying on a considerable amount of dialogue improvisation, and employing documentary-style cinematographic techniques.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 a new {{master plan}} called 2020 Vision: A Community Concept for the MSU Campus was {{developed}} to guide future campus development. Amongst the recommendations it called for the removing of central campus parking to parking garages replacing it with green space, the removal of head-in parking around West and East Circle Drives, adding more bike lanes and planting more trees on south campus {{in order to give}} it the look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of north campus.|$|E

Airbus says it offers better luggage storage and a quieter cabin, packaged with a more modern look <b>and</b> <b>feel.</b> Additionally, improved cabin efficiency from a new galley concept, reduced weight, improved ergonomics and food hygiene, and recycling requirements.

5|$|Mabel Tolkien {{taught her}} two {{children}} at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil. She taught him {{a great deal of}} botany and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early.|$|E
5|$|Paths, arbors, and fences use {{traditional}} or antique looking materials. Wooden {{fences and}} gates, paths covered with locally made bricks or stone, and arbors using natural materials all give a more casual—and less formal—look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> to a cottage garden. Pots, ornaments, and furniture also use natural looking materials with traditional finishes—everything is chosen {{to give the}} impression of an old-fashioned country garden.|$|E
5|$|Production {{designer}} Kenneth Mak included Western {{elements in}} his design, since Foshan, in earlier years, {{was a unique}} place where Chinese and Western cultures converged. Pillars were made to resemble English lampposts, and Western lighting, chairs and tableware were also used. To convey the culture <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of the time, the buildings were made to look obsolete and worn out. Apart from historical references, Mak also created a glass house which was used in a scene in the film.|$|E

5|$|The big {{dance was}} the film's most {{sustained}} and elaborate sequence, so two cameras were used, with frequent recourse to hand-holding and telephoto zooming in order both {{to sustain the}} documentary-style look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> and to take pressure off the performers, who were not always sure whether they were being included in the shots.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament becomes inflamed {{and there}} may be pain when biting or tapping on the tooth. On an X-ray, bone resporption appears as a radiolucent area around the end of the root, although this does not manifest immediately. Acute apical periodontitis is characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain. The alveolar process may be tender to palpation over the roots. The tooth may be raised in the socket <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> more prominent than the adjacent teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} design was handled by Kumar's wife Vanita. After plans to shoot in Manipur were dropped because of safety concerns, extensive research {{was done to}} find locations similar to Manipur. Their search ended in Himachal Pradesh, Manali, where {{a major portion of}} the state was recreated. Vanita used a real structure instead of a set to show Kom's childhood home in Kangathei. She recreated the look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of Manipur in Dharamshala and Manali.|$|E

5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of their wounds and scars <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> guilty about their behaviour, leading them to {{go to great lengths to}} conceal their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E
5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E

5|$|In the sub-plot, Lisa {{discovers that}} the senior {{citizens}} at Grampa's nursing home {{do not have}} any entertainment, and decides to buy them a digital TV converter. However, while at the store to buy it, she discovers Mr. Burns feeling very happy playing Funtendo Zii Sports. She decides to buy this for the senior citizens, hoping they will feel younger and happier. When playing the Zii, the senior citizens feel very happy <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> younger. This forces the nurses at the home to work extra hard after their workout, prompting them to wash the Zii in the dishwasher, causing it to break. Lisa becomes angry at the nurses for doing it on purpose, thus showing their disregard for the senior citizens. However, the nurses blow her off. The senior citizens then return to their boring selves, staring at TV static.|$|E
5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{had never}} been happy with the brightly lit {{corridors}} <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> of the Enterprise, a dissatisfaction that extended to his work on The Wrath of Khan. For The Undiscovered Country, Meyer wanted the Enterprise interiors to feel grittier and more realistic; the metal was worn around the edges to look used without looking beat up. Narita's plans to transform {{the look of the}} Enterprise on a scale not seen since The Wrath of Khan were complicated by the necessary use of existing sets.|$|E
