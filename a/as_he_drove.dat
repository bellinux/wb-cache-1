5|$|Michael Bree's first {{victim was}} Jodie Hyde, a {{recovering}} butane gas addict {{whom he met}} at the Rainbow before killing her hours later. He {{is thought to have}} strangled her before setting her body on fire near a recreation ground. Three days later, he met mother-of-three Rosemary Corcoran at the same public house and drove her to a rural location, where he bludgeoned her to death and drove over the body. Then, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> home, he hit care worker Carol Jordan with his car and, fearing capture, beat her to death. All three bodies were discovered soon after the murders were carried out.|$|E

6000|$|... "Velveteen coat, ma'am, and no 'at. Very good, ma'am." [...] And the cabman {{whipped up}} at {{once in the}} most matter-of-fact way, <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> to this address every day in his life.|$|R
60|$|Five {{minutes more}} found them {{again on the}} way, and now Songbird had the large lights turned on, which made the roadway ahead as bright <b>as</b> day. <b>He</b> <b>drove</b> <b>as</b> speedily as possible, but with great care, {{avoiding}} everything {{that looked as if}} it might harm the tires.|$|R
60|$|Twice warned {{and once}} arrested, was Dick {{through the long}} afternoon. <b>He</b> <b>drove</b> alone, and though <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> with speed <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> with safety. Accidents, for which he {{personally}} might be responsible, were things he did not tolerate. And they never occurred. That same sureness and definiteness of adjustment with which, without fumbling or approximating, {{he picked up a}} pencil or reached for a door-knob, was his in the more complicated adjustments, with which, <b>as</b> instance, <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> a high-powered machine at high speed over busy country roads.|$|R
25|$|Bryant {{then got}} back {{into his car and}} left the car park. Witnesses say he was {{sounding}} the horn and waving <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove.</b> Bryant drove along Jetty Road towards the toll booth where a number of people were running away. Bryant passed by at least two people.|$|E

One official of the Iraqi government stated that the abduction occurred {{at the hands of}} a special army unit that reports directly to the US military command, but this was denied by American military officials. Iran's Foreign Ministry has condemned the kidnapping and pinned the blame on the US.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, Turkington {{returned}} to the BTCC with WSR (now competing <b>as</b> eBay Motors). <b>He</b> <b>drove</b> one of their three new BMW 125is. He finished 4th in the 2013 Drivers' Championship after taking five race wins.|$|R
25|$|The Sayeret former commander, Giora (Guni) Harnik {{had been}} {{discharged}} from the IDF just a week earlier, but was suddenly called back. Since the unit commander, Moshe Kaplinsky, was reported wounded while on the road, Harnik was sent <b>as</b> replacement. <b>He</b> <b>drove</b> there so fast that his APC flipped over, although {{he and the other}} passengers were uninjured. His surprise return was a morale boost for the unit men. His deputy was Mordechai (Moti) Goldman.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 he {{competed in}} the Hungarian SEAT León Supercup, where <b>he</b> {{finished}} <b>as</b> runner-up. <b>He</b> <b>drove</b> in the SEAT León Eurocup, winning one race at Monza, and finishing 14th overall.

After retiring in race one, he finished sixteenth in the second race.|$|R
25|$|McElwaine was {{an active}} member of the PIRA, who became Officer Commanding of the IRA in County Fermanagh by the age of 19. On 5 February 1980, McElwaine murdered off-duty Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) {{corporal}} Aubrey Abercrombie <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> a tractor in the townland of Drumacabranagher, near Florencecourt. Later that year, on 23 September, McElwaine murdered off-duty Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) Reserve Constable Ernest Johnston outside his home in Rosslea.

25|$|During {{the period}} 1971 to 1986, Stewart covered F1 races, NASCAR races and Indianapolis 500 as a color commentator, and also functioned as host for the latter. Jackie was a play-by-play {{announcer}} for the Luge at the 1976 Winter Olympics and the Equestrian at the 1976 Summer Olympics (partnered with Chris Schenkel) on ABC's Wide World of Sports. He was noted for his insightful analysis, Scottish accent, and rapid delivery, which once caused Jim McKay to remark that Stewart spoke almost as fast <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove.</b>|$|E
50|$|Stanton {{started his}} racing career by {{spending}} 10 {{years on a}} motocross bike. He went on to start racing cars in 1986, {{with the help of}} his brother, Mark. During Stanton's first full season <b>as</b> an amateur, <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> in 49 races. During his second season, <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> in 41 races.

50|$|Lindley's last career Grand National start came at Richmond in 1985 for Bobby Hawkins in a {{car with}} Larry McReynolds <b>as</b> crew chief. <b>He</b> <b>drove</b> the #16 Carolina Tool Chevrolet, started 17th and was running near the front before a lug bolt fell off and he settled for a 19th-place finish.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well!' said <b>he,</b> <b>as</b> they <b>drove</b> off, 'he is a {{very fine}} fellow, after all! I don't know {{what is to be}} done for him! I wish we could find a Theodora for him.' ...|$|R
25|$|Before departing France Mannock {{met with}} McElroy, Jones and McCudden {{and they took}} a car to Boulogne. Mannock's {{reputation}} had spread well {{beyond the confines of}} his squadron and mechanics, junior officers and comrades lined the road to form an honour guard <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> away. In Boulogne Mannock stopped at a hospital to bid farewell to an Irish nurse called Murphy; whether the two were involved in a relationship is unknown. In January Mannock toured England, visiting London, Birmingham, and Northampton to rest with family.|$|E
25|$|Sykes had a {{difficult}} start to his next posting, in the Middle East. He was almost {{killed in a car}} accident on a steep road to the Horns of Hattin in Palestine. His car was fired on by a French warship <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> to Sidon; he noticed tiny flashes blinking on the side of the ship, shortly followed by explosions on the road in front of him. He was violently sick on an aerial reconnaissance flight, and he became ill with malaria, ending up in hospital in Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Once he {{finished}} eating, Bryant moved towards {{the back of}} the café and set a video camera on a vacant table. He took out a Colt AR-15 SP1 Carbine (semi-automatic rifle) and, firing from the hip, began shooting patrons and staff. Within fifteen seconds, he had fired seventeen shots, killing twelve people and wounding ten. Bryant then walked {{to the other side of}} the shop and fired 12 more times, killing another eight people while wounding two. He then changed magazines before fleeing, shooting at people in the car park and from his yellow Volvo 244 sedan <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> away; four were killed and an additional six were injured.|$|E
50|$|Biffle {{began his}} Cup Series {{career in the}} 2002 season. He {{attempted}} to qualify in a Roush Ford for the 2002 Daytona 500 but {{failed to make the}} race. He would make his first Cup debut nine races later at California, a race in which he finished 13th. That was his best finish in seven races that year <b>as</b> <b>he</b> also <b>drove</b> four in a Chevrolet for Andy Petree Racing and two in a Dodge for Petty Enterprises.|$|R
5000|$|Kanté's parents {{migrated}} to France from Mali in 1980, and {{he grew up}} in a small flat in Rueil-Malmaison, Hauts-de-Seine. As of 2017, his younger sister was in the youth system at Suresnes. At the start of his professional career at Boulogne, he commuted to training by kick scooter, and <b>as</b> of 2017 <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> a Mini Cooper, interpreted by BBC Sport's Paul Fletcher <b>as</b> showing <b>he</b> is [...] "uninterested in displaying his wealth".|$|R
5000|$|Turner gained {{his first}} aerial {{victories}} on 13 August 1917, while serving in No. 55 Squadron, flying an Airco DH.4 two-seater day bomber. With Second Lieutenant R.

25|$|In 1918, Ball {{was elected}} to the U.S. Senate in the second popular {{election}} of a U.S. Senator in Delaware, defeating incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Willard Saulsbury, Jr.. During this term, Ball served with the Republican majority in the 66th, 67th and 68th U.S. Congress. In the 66th Congress he was chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills and in the 67th and 68th Congress {{he was a member of}} the Committee on the District of Columbia. He was also appointed as a member of the rent commission of Washington. Ball's actions with the rent commission angered some people. In August 1921, a shot was fired at Ball <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> in an automobile, although he was not injured. The senator had received a threatening letter the day of the assault.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to ride in}} Canada, Kelly {{rode the}} 1976 Tour of Britain {{and then went to}} Metz, in France, after a London enthusiast, Johnny Morris, had {{arranged}} an invitation. The club offered him £25 a week, free accommodation and four francs a kilometre for every race he won. Kelly won 18 of the 25 races he started in France and won the amateur Giro di Lombardia in Italy. That impressed two French team managers, Jean de Gribaldy and Cyrille Guimard. De Gribaldy went to Ireland unannounced to discuss a contract with the Flandria professional team. He didn't know where Kelly lived and wasn't sure he would recognise him. He took with him another cyclist, to point out Kelly and translate the conversation. Kelly was out driving a tractor and de Gribaldy set out again in the taxi that had brought him from Dublin, hoping to find Kelly <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> home. They found him and went to Kelly's stepbrother's house. De Gribaldy offered £4,000 a year plus bonuses. A week later Kelly asked for £6,000 and got it. He signed for de Gribaldy with misgivings about going back on his promise to return to Metz, where the club had offered him better terms than before.|$|E
25|$|In {{time these}} armed groups consolidated, with the FAR joining the Montoneros, {{formerly}} an urban group of intellectuals and students, and the FAP and FAL being {{absorbed into the}} ERP. In 1970, Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, one of the military leaders of the 1955 coup, was kidnapped and killed by the Montoneros, in its first claimed military action. In 1970, the Marxist People's Revolutionary Army (ERP) was founded. By the early 1970s, leftist guerrillas kidnapped and assassinated high-ranking military and police officers almost weekly. These assassinations generated much panic among the officer corps with a naval officer in the book Military Rebellion in Argentina (University of Nebraska Press, 1996) claiming {{that his wife had}} to stand guard at their apartment window with rifle in hand in order to cover him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> to work each morning. The extreme left bombed and destroyed numerous buildings in the 1970s in its campaign against the government; these belonged chiefly to military and police hierarchies. But a number of civilian and non-governmental buildings were targeted as well, such as the Sheraton Hotel in Buenos Aires, which was bombed in 1972, killing a Canadian woman and injuring her husband; a crowded theatre in downtown Buenos Aires was bombed in 1975. In 1978, a powerful bomb meant to kill an Argentine admiral ripped through a nine-story apartment building, killing three civilians and trapping scores beneath the debris.|$|E
5000|$|At age 10, Vaughn {{performed}} {{his first}} acting {{role in a}} community theater production of the musical Oliver!, staged in the [...] Von Braun Center's 2000-seat concert hall. Vaughn continued acting <b>as</b> <b>he</b> attended Lee High School and performed in several productions while attending Birmingham-Southern College. It was there that Vaughn decided to pursue acting <b>as</b> a career. <b>He</b> <b>drove</b> to New York with just $600 and initially stayed with a family acquaintance, making the commute to New York City from Peekskill.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> then trained <b>as</b> a pilot, and was {{appointed}} a flying officer on 8 June 1917. Promoted to lieutenant on 1 July, he was posted to No. 22 Squadron RFC, flying the two-seater Bristol Fighter. He gained his fifth aerial victory on 10 October, destroying an Albatros D.V over Moorslede with observer Air Mechanic 1st Class Arch Whitehouse. The next day, with Captain F. A. Durrad <b>as</b> his observer <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> down another D.V.|$|R
60|$|At him came Morella, {{and with}} a light, grating sound his sword fell upon the steel. Before he could recover himself Peter struck back; but Morella bent his knees, and the stroke only shore the black plumes from his casque. Quick <b>as</b> light <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> at Peter's face with his point; but the Englishman leapt to one side, and the thrust went past him. Again Morella came at him, and struck so mighty a blow that, {{although}} Peter caught it on his buckler, it sliced through the edge of it and fell upon his unprotected neck and shoulder, wounding him, for now red blood showed on the white armour, and Peter reeled back beneath the stroke.|$|R
25|$|Leimer's {{advantage}} over Coletti had dwindled to 1.3 seconds but regained {{some of that}} lead by overtaking the battling Evans and Giovesi at turn four. Coletti was then delayed by the same traffic jam and was three seconds adrift of Leimer. The yet-to-stop Quaife-Hobbs was now leading the field and was followed by Dillmann, Leal and Giovesi. Dilmann made his pit stop on the 18th lap and Leal followed on the next lap; Leal stalled <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> away from his pit box and required assistance from his team's mechanics to restart his car. He later received a penalty for pit lane over-speeding. On the 20th lap and having led the last ten laps, Quaife-Hobbs was the last driver to enter the pit lane and Leimer regained first place. Quaife-Hobbs fell behind Dillmann but moved back ahead of the latter after getting his tyres up to temperature. Frijns moved {{to the inside of}} Richelmi on lap 21 heading towards turn one but went into the side of Richelmi's car and damaged his front wing. Frijns drove slowly to the pit lane for repairs but Richelmi was forced to abandon his damaged car on the circuit. Evans became the event's final retirement on the 25th lap when he stopped at one of the circuit's the run-off areas with smoke bellowing from his car due to debris penetrating its radiator and overheating the engine.|$|E
25|$|The replay (the last semi-final replay in {{the history}} of the FA Cup) went down as one of the {{greatest}} games ever played. David Beckham opened the scoring with a curving shot past Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman from 22 yards, but Dennis Bergkamp equalised halfway through the second half, his shot deflecting off the knee of Jaap Stam. Nicolas Anelka had the ball in the back of the net for Arsenal again shortly afterwards, and the celebrations were well underway before anyone realised that the linesman had flagged Anelka offside before the goal was scored. Roy Keane then received a second booking and was sent off for a cynical foul on Marc Overmars, leaving Manchester United to play out the match with 10 men. The match was heading for extra time when Phil Neville made a tired challenge on Ray Parlour inside the penalty area; Bergkamp stepped up to take the penalty, but Peter Schmeichel guessed the direction of his kick correctly and it was at a good height for him to make the save. The first half of extra time passed without incident, before Patrick Vieira gave the ball away to Giggs at the start of the second; Giggs ran from just inside his own half, taking on four Arsenal defenders <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> into the penalty area, then shot from a narrow angle over the head of Seaman into the roof of the Arsenal net. Manchester United hung on for the remaining 10 minutes to secure their place in the final.|$|E
25|$|Michael Schumacher {{started to}} {{maintain}} a 0.2-second lead over Häkkinen who began a challenge for the lead. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race so far on the third lap–a 1:25.861–to close the gap to Michael Schumacher to be one tenth of a second behind. Coulthard suffered a rear-suspension failure and spun off into the gravel trap at Priory corner causing him to retire on the same lap. Verstappen got ahead of Villeneuve and Alesi to take over ninth position on the fourth lap, whilst Fisichella went off the race track and drove through the gravel trap at Copse corner and rejoined behind Alonso on the same lap. Michael Schumacher lost control of his car at the entry to Copse corner allowing Häkkinen to take advantage and moved into the lead {{at the start of}} lap five. Häkkinen started to pull away from Michael Schumacher. Burti became the third retirement of the race when smoke billowed from his engine on lap six and oil was dropped on the track, causing the marshals to display a oil on track warning flag. As Häkkinen continued to extend his lead, Montoya had closed the gap to Michael Schumacher to be 1.6 seconds behind the Ferrari driver on lap ten. Villeneuve overtook Alesi at Stowe corner and moved into tenth position on lap eleven. By lap 15, Montoya had further closed the gap to Michael Schumacher and passed the Ferrari driver to take over second position <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>drove</b> down the start/finish straight heading towards Stowe corner. By lap 20, Häkkinen had a lead of 25.2 seconds over Montoya, who in turn was 4.5 seconds in front of Michael Schumacher and was drawing ahead of the Ferrari driver. Barrichello was a further 10.9 seconds behind his team-mate and was being caught by Ralf Schumacher in fifth.|$|E
60|$|There was a faint {{gleam in}} her eyes at which Sproatly {{apparently}} took warning, for he said no more upon that subject, and they talked about other matters until he took his departure {{an hour or two}} later. It was next afternoon when he appeared again, and Mrs. Hastings smiled at Agatha <b>as</b> <b>he</b> and Winifred <b>drove</b> away together.|$|R
5000|$|Reutimann {{began working}} on race cars at age 13 despite his mother's protests. Primarily a Short track racer, he made one NASCAR start on November 11, 1962 in Tampa, Florida at Golden Gate Speedway. He started 18th and {{finished}} 10th in the event, which was {{considered part of the}} 1963 season. He was given the nickname [...] "Buzzie" [...] at birth after several nurses noticed he made buzzing sounds <b>as</b> an infant. <b>He</b> <b>drove</b> the number #00, and so did his son David in the Sprint Cup Series.|$|R
50|$|Born in Belleville, Illinois, Knepper {{also died}} there <b>as</b> from cancer. <b>He</b> <b>drove</b> in the USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1963-1972 seasons, with 75 career starts, {{including}} the 1965-1969 Indianapolis 500 races. He {{finished in the}} top ten 21 times, with his best finish in 3rd position twice in 1966. Knepper earned a small place in Indianapolis lore when he crashed on the 87th lap of the 1969 Indianapolis 500, and instead of making the typical dash to trackside safety, stood up on his car and, facing 180-mph oncoming traffic, frantically waved his arms to warn oncoming drivers of the danger.|$|R
