Nyssa shows up, explaining that she was brought to Logopolis by the same figure that the Doctor encountered. Logopolis soon falls under the Master's control, but the stasis field he is generating ends up releasing Entropy and eroding matter throughout the universe, threatening to destroy the entire universe.|$|E
25|$|Following the war, the {{political}} energies {{of the newly}} independent states were focused on forming “a more perfect union,” first in the Articles of Confederation, later in the Constitution of the United States of America. The newly independent daughter churches of the Church of England also sought “a more perfect union,” and foremost in the leadership was the same Abraham Beach. In the winter of 1783/84 he corresponded with William White (later the first Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church) and other clergy in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York soliciting a gathering to “consider {{the state of the}} church.” He extended an invitation to meet at Christ Church May 11, 1784. The outgrowth of that meeting was a call for another meeting in October 1784 with representatives from all thirteen states to consider a general convention to manage the affairs of the newly independent church. The First General Convention met in September 1785, leading to the current shape of the church we now know: with equal voice and vote for bishops, clergy and laity, the beginnings of an American Book of Common Prayer, <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> national Constitution and Canons.|$|E

500|$|According to Luca Codignola of the University of Genoa, {{contact with}} a {{powerful}} extraterrestrial civilization is comparable to occasions where one powerful civilization destroyed another, such as the arrival of Christopher Columbus and Hernán Cortés into the Americas and the subsequent destruction of the indigenous civilizations and their ways of life. However, the applicability of such a model to contact with extraterrestrial civilizations, and that specific interpretation of {{the arrival of the}} European colonists to the Americas, have been disputed. Even so, any large difference between the power of an extraterrestrial civilization <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> could be demoralizing and potentially cause or accelerate the collapse of human society.

Obama said the incident did not represent the [...] "exceptional character" [...] of the American military and the respect that the United States had for the people of Afghanistan. On 13 March, he said, [...] "the United States takes this as seriously as if it were our own citizens <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> children who were murdered. We’re heartbroken over the loss of innocent life. The killing of innocent civilians is outrageous and it’s unacceptable."

We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [...] let our hair grow." [...] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. [...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it.

500|$|Author Joley Wood {{compared}} [...] "Lisa the Skeptic" [...] to {{an alternate}} reality game, {{in analyzing the}} effects of watching the television program Lost on contemporary culture <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> perceptions of reality. Dan O'Brien cited the episode {{in a discussion of}} ontology, skepticism, and religious faith, in his book An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge. O'Brien leaves it up to the reader {{to decide whether or not}} Lisa was justified in her skepticism. In , [...] "Lisa the Skeptic" [...] is cited as a prime example of why Lisa is seen as the epitome of a nerd. The book also cited the episode in noting that Lisa is not infallible, for when the Angel appeared to speak at the end of the episode she became as frightened as everyone else. Lisa's frustration with the marketing gimmick used by the mall developers is seen by Turner's [...] as yet another example of her conflict with corporations throughout the series. Like O'Brien, Turner also analyzed the episode in the context of Lisa's questions about existentialism, self-absorption, and consumption. In , the authors discuss Lisa's level of anger displayed in the episode, noting that in this particular case her anger gave her the wherewithal both to confront social injustice, and keep her mind clear for critical thinking. Mark Demming of Allmovie noted that Lisa symbolically stood for the side of reason, while her mother Marge symbolized belief and spirituality in the episode.|$|E
