5|$|The Survivor Series in November 2003 also {{marked the}} first time Lesnar met Goldberg from the Raw brand. After Lesnar claimed in a {{backstage}} interview that he could beat <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, Goldberg interrupted the interview and introduced himself to Lesnar, shaking hands with him before leaving with a staredown. Lesnar followed this rivalry with a feud involving Hardcore Holly. In the storyline, Holly wanted revenge on Lesnar for legitimately injuring his neck during a previous match between the two in 2002 which left Holly in need of neck surgery and out of action for a year. At the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2004, Lesnar defeated Holly to retain the WWE Championship. Later in the Royal Rumble match, Lesnar attacked Goldberg and attacked him with an F-5, enabling Kurt Angle to eliminate him.|$|E

On June 2, 2006, Thompson suggested that West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana police detectives, investigating {{the murder of}} 55-year-old Michael Gore by 17-year-old Kurt Edward Neher, should look into the video games played by Neher.

500|$|Bure's playing style {{reflected}} the speed, skill and puck possession that was prominent in Soviet Union hockey programs. The most prevalent {{aspects of his}} game were his skating speed, agility, and acceleration, which earned him his nickname the [...] "Russian Rocket". He {{was able to use}} his quickness to separate himself from defenders, to retrieve pucks before the opposition could in all zones of the ice, and to skate the length of the ice on many occasions. In a 1993 poll of NHL coaches conducted by hockey writer Bob McKenzie, Bure was named the league's best skater with eight of twenty-one votes, twice as many votes as any other player. One coach noted: [...] "Bure has the best combination of speed, agility and balance ... He can also use change of speed better than <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league right now." ...|$|E

He commented to Wiesner, [...] "I don’t understand. Scientists are supposed to be rational people. How can there be such differences on a technical issue?" [...] His fascination grew and he eventually compiled a mass of material on Zeus which took up one corner of a room where he spent hundreds of hours becoming an expert on the topic. In one meeting with Edward Teller, Kennedy demonstrated that he knew more about the Zeus and ABMs than Teller. Teller then expended considerable effort to bring himself up to the same level of knowledge. Wiesner would later note that the pressure to make a decision built up until [...] "Kennedy came to feel that the only thing <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country was concerned about was Nike-Zeus." ...|$|E

[...] Chris Carter said of writer Darin Morgan, [...] "It's been a wonderful coincidence of timing, talent, {{and the success of}} the show, allowing it to stretch in a direction it would never have been able to {{if it had been a}} less successful or if it had been a younger show. Darin is a truly original comic mind.

[...] In a Sports Illustrated cover story about Rivera that was published in the final week of his career, Verducci said of the pitcher, [...] "Few players in any sport have retired with more reverence from his peers." [...] Rivera was the last MLB player to wear the uniform number 42 on a regular basis; {{at the time of his}} retirement, he was the only active player still grandfathered by the league to wear Jackie Robinson's retired number. Speaking about Rivera's connection to her husband, Robinson's widow Rachel said, [...] " [...] carried himself with dignity and grace, and that made carrying the number a tribute to Jack... I've always been proud and pleased that Mariano was the one chosen to wear that number because I think he brought something special to it." [...] Presenting him with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award, Selig said: [...] "Throughout his illustrious career, he has represented his family, his country, the Yankees and all of Major League Baseball with the utmost class and dignity. It is wholly appropriate that Mariano was the last Major League player to wear Jackie Robinson's sacred number 42." ...|$|E

2500|$|Seinfeld broke several {{conventions}} of mainstream television. The show offers no growth or reconciliation to its characters. It eschews sentimentality. An episode is typically driven by humor interspersed with the superficial conflicts of characters with peculiar dispositions. Many episodes {{revolve around the}} characters' involvement {{in the lives of}} others with typically disastrous results. On the set, the notion that the characters should not develop or improve throughout the series was expressed as the [...] "no hugging, no learning" [...] rule. Also unlike most sitcoms, there are no moments of pathos; the audience is never made to feel sorry for any of the characters. Even Susan's death elicits no genuine emotions from <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> show.|$|E

Playing throughout Kansas, Missouri, the Dakotas, Illinois, and even Utah, large crowds turned out to see Paige throw an inning or two, relying on junkballs. Paige recalled, [...] "Everybody'd heard I was a fastballer and here I was throwing Alley Oops and bloopers and underhand and sidearm and any way I could {{to get the ball}} {{up to the plate and}} get it over, maybe even for a strike.

2500|$|As Robert Nichols {{stated in}} The Times:Sir Henry possessed the fullest {{as well as}} the wisest mind I have ever known. It was no unusual thing to hear him in the course of one evening {{discourse}} on topics so various as: the influence of reasoning upon Goethe and Mozart, types of apprehension in listeners to symphonic music, sensations while looping the loop (he was over 60 when he did so), the painting of Guardi, 'co-ordination' in a star golfer, Ninon de Lenclos, Conrad as a narrator (Sir Henry was far the ablest literary critic I have ever known), religious ecstasy, the relation of art and science, the social customs of Melanesia. On each of such topics he not only appeared to have more information than <b>anybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room, but spoke after a more illuminating fashion, for, like Leonardo (on whom he was an authority) he had a supreme eye for the significant.

Jones, a visiting professor at Stanford University, said the Beck rally seemed to be tasteful and did not appear to distort King's message, which included a recommitment to religious values. James Freeman, in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, wrote positively about the rally, remarking that [...] "the day was largely devoted to expressions of gratitude for the sacrifices of U.S. soldiers, for great men of American history like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and for God." [...] He said [...] "you couldn't find a more polite crowd" [...] and remarked that he couldn't find a single piece of trash left on the Mall by attendees. After noting how the crowd refused to boo when Dave Roever gave the closing prayer thanking God for President Obama and members of Congress, Freeman theorized that [...] "between Saturday's crowd in Washington and the tea partiers agitating for limited government, we may be witnessing the rebuilding of the Reagan coalition, the fusion of religious and economic conservatives." [...] Fox News host Bill O'Reilly described it as an [...] "appeal for a return to Judeo-Christian values" [...] and called it [...] "a huge victory for Glenn Beck and Americans who believe that his message of honor and dignity is worthwhile."
