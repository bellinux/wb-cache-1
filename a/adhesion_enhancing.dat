40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of fiber-matrix adhesion on the linear viscoelastic creep behavior of as received and surface modified carbon fiber (AR-CF and SM-CF, respectively) reinforced polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) composite materials was investigated. Short-term tensile creep tests {{were performed on}} ± 45 ° specimens under four different isothermal condition; 70, 80, 90 and 100 °C. As a preliminary step to obtain the time-temperature master curve, {{as well as to}} characterize the changes in matrix dominated properties over storage time, physical aging effects were evaluated on both systems using the short-term test method established by Struik. The results showed that the surface treatment carried out in the SM-CF improved fiber-matrix <b>adhesion,</b> <b>enhancing</b> the mechanical performance of CF/PPS composites but with minor effects on the creep response.

The matricellular protein thrombospondin- 1 (TSP 1), through interaction with its receptor CD 47, inhibits soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activation by NO in vascular cells. In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) both intracellular cGMP and cAMP regulate adhesion, contractility, proliferation, and migration. cGMP can regulate cAMP through feedback control of hydrolysis. Inhibition of the cAMP phosphodiesterase- 4 selectively {{interfered with the}} ability of exogenous TSP 1 to block NO-driven VSMC adhesion but not cGMP accumulation, suggesting that cAMP also contributes to VSMC regulation by TSP 1. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase- 4 was sufficient to elevate cAMP levels, and inhibiting guanylyl cyclase or phosphodiesterase- 3, or adding exogenous TSP 1 reversed this increase in cAMP. Thus, TSP 1 regulates VSMC cAMP levels in part via cGMP-dependent inhibition of phosphodiesterase- 3. Additionally basal cAMP levels were consistently elevated in both VSMCs and skeletal muscle from TSP 1 null mice, and treating null cells with exogenous TSP 1 suppressed cAMP levels to those of wild type cells. TSP 1 inhibited both forskolin and isoprotereno...|$|E
40|$|With recent {{technological}} improvements, {{fabrication of}} integrated circuit elements on shrinking scales {{is required to}} meet the demand for massive storage and fast data processing. As the fabrication of high resolution patterns requires short wavelength radiation sources, extreme ultraviolet and electron beam techniques have been developed as radiation sources for next-generation lithography. Advancements of lithography techniques accompany the evolution of resist materials for the synchronous fulfillment of high sensitivity, high resolution, and high structural integrity. Our strategy for nanofabrication is a combination of bottom-up synthesis and top-down lithography. The use of cylindrical brush polymers, which can vertically align on substrates, affords access to electron-beam-generated patterns with the minimum pixel size determined by the cylinder diameter. Cylindrical brush polymers for negative- and positive-tone photoresist materials were synthesized by controlled radical and olefin metathesis polymerization. Macromonomers with well-defined size variations were prepared by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization of monomers having surface energy reducing, substrate <b>adhesion</b> <b>enhancing,</b> and lithographically functioning moieties. Then, sequential ring-opening metathesis polymerization of the macromonomers via a ?grafting-through? strategy allows precise control of concentric and lengthwise dimensions and compositions in the brush polymer structures. The brush polymers consist of a rigid polymeric backbone with covalently tethered side chains which allow facile access to a cylindrical morphology due to their steric repulsion. Low surface energy of fluoropolymers at one end and the high polarity of groups at the other end drive the cylindrical brush polymers to vertically align on the polar silicon wafer substrate as characterized by surface analysis techniques. The stretched conformation of the brush polymers facilitates their assembly by reducing chain entanglement. The chemically amplified resists from the brush polymers exhibit high lithographic performance with a few tens of nanometer resolution. The brush polymers with poly(p-hydroxystyrene) s yielded negative-tone features by crosslinking chemistry, while those having acid-labile tertiary esters gave positive-tone features. Cylindrical brush polymer based resists showed their superior lithographic performance over linear block copolymer precursors in both resolution and sensitivity by having each vertically aligned molecule act as a molecular pixel. As a result, the tuning of composition and dimension using bottom-up synthetic strategy allows the fine tuning of top-down lithographic performance.

40|$|Nanomaterial {{metrology}} {{is fundamental}} to understanding the physical properties of nanomaterials and their environmental interactions. Particles, in the nano and sub-micrometer regimes, are attractive materials for use in biomedical applications such as drug delivery and medical imaging. In order to address concerns regarding their potential for cytotoxicity, particle characterisation before and after exposure to biologically relevant media is critical. Size {{is one of many}} particle properties that can influence their behaviour in biomedical applications, including their cellular uptake and circulation lifetime. Therefore, the sizing capabilities of three established (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning mobility particle sizing (SMPS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS)) and three emerging particle sizing techniques (scanning ion occlusion sensing (SIOS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and differential centrifugal sedimentation (DCS)) with Stober silica particles, 100 - 400 nm in diameter, as the test material, were evaluated. When exposed to biological media particles will spontaneously be coated with a film of biomolecules, predominantly proteins, which will subsequently define their biological identities. Being able to quantify and evaluate the composition of these so called "protein coronas" is key to understanding the bio-nano interface. In this study, the amount of immunoglobulin G (IgG) adsorbed onto gold particles, as a function of particle size and protein concentration, was measured, using a combination of techniques including DLS (and [Symbol appears here.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{gastrula}} of the {{sea urchin}} Strongylocentrotus purpuratus was dissociated into single cells. In culture these cells appeared apolar, but reassembled into quasi-normal embryos composed of structures with polarized cells. In this study {{emphasis was placed on}} those morphological events coincident with the reestablishment of a polar orientation within the epithelial cells. Using both time-lapse dark-field-phase microscopy and electron microscopy, the major morphological events followed in detail include: (a) the migration of lysosome-like vesicles to specific margins within the epithelial cells; (b) the migration of the epithelial cells during the re-construction of the epithelium: and (c) the reformation of the cell junctions between the epithelial cells. Evidence indicates that: (1) The orientation resulting from the migration of the lysosome-like vesicles is transient and may not determine any lasting polarity of the epithelial cell. The sequential migration of the lysosome-like vesicles first to the epithelial cell to cell interface, then to the basal margin and finally to the apical margin of the epithelial cell was coincident with and apparently in response to the presence of cell debris often trapped at these sites. The Lysosome-like vesicles formed tight clusters along the epithelial cellular margins where phagocytosis of cell debris and resorption of specialized structures occurred. In contrast, the mesenchyme cell had smaller numbers of phagosomes and lysosome-like vesicles and was observed to participate to a more limited degree in phagocytosis and resorption. (2) The orientation resulting from the formation of a leading edge during the migration of the epithelial cell is transient. The sequence of cytological events associated with epithelial cell migration included the formation of: (a) hyaloplasmic blebs along the cell free margin; (b) filopodia and microvilli; and (c) lamellae with a number of lamellipodia at the leading edge. In contrast, the mesenchyme cell formed filopodia on a smaller scale and was observed to participate in migration only to a limited degree. Coincident with the cessation of epithelial cell migration was the enlargement of the lamella between the epithelial cells into a hyaloplasmic sheet which forms the blastocoel wall. Embryonic cells from reassembling aggregates were cultured as monolayers on glass treated with an <b>adhesion</b> <b>enhancing</b> factor derived from the incubation medium. Cords of cells, composed of both epithelial and mesenchyme cells migrate away from the aggregate and leave in their wake clusters of cells. Epithelial cells were found at the leading margins of these cell cords and were observed forming cytoplasmic blebs, filopodia and hyaloplasmic leading edges during the migration of the cell cord. No apparent coordinate orientation was detectable within the epithelial cells of the migrating cell cord or stationary cell cluster. A hypothesis is presented suggesting a role for resorption during epithelial cell migration. (3) Cell contacts formed during reaggregation become more adhesive as development proceeds. The sequence of fine structural events associated with cell contact formation include the formation of (a) a non [...] junctional cell apposition, which was characterized by parallel apposed membranes; (b) an incipient continuous junction, which was characterized by parallel apposed membranes; and (c) a continuous junction, which was characterized by the presence of an electron dense region both superjacent and subjacent to the plasma membrane {{at the site of the}} junction. The cell appositions between premigratory cells were easier to disrupt mechanically than the later forming continuous junctions. The forming continuous junction was first focal in extent and later zonal in girth around the apical margin of the epithelial cell. Concurrent with the formation of the strongly adhesive continuous junction by the lamella was a cessation of epithelial cell migration, followed by an expression of an apical-basal polarity within the epithelial cell. A hypothesis is presented suggesting a role for cell contacts during the coordinated orientation of the epithelia during the formation of the blastocoel wall...|$|E

We engineered micropatterned surfaces to control the size and position of focal adhesions in order to analyze the contributions of these specialized adhesive structures to adhesion strengthening. By applying surface micropatterning techniques, we showed robust control over cell-substrate contact area and focal adhesion assembly. Using a hydrodynamic shear assay to quantify adhesion strength to micropatterned substrates, we observed significant adhesive area- and time-dependent increases in adhesion strength. Complimentary biochemical assays allowed us to probe the role of structural proteins recruited to focal adhesions and examine the structure-function relationships between these adhesive structures and adhesion strength. These findings provide insights into the role of focal adhesions in adhesion strengthening, and may contribute to tissue engineering and biomaterials applications. Ph. D.

Among these modifications, loss of cell polarity represents the nearly invariable, distinguishing feature of EMT that frequently precedes the other traits or might even occur in their absence. EMT transforms cell morphology and physiology, and hence cell identity, from one typical of cells that form a tight barrier, like epithelial and endothelial cells, to one characterized by a highly motile mesenchymal phenotype. Time-resolved proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of cells undergoing EMT recently identified thousands of changes in proteins involved in many cellular processes, including cell proliferation and motility, DNA repair, and – unexpectedly – membrane trafficking (1) ...|$|R
40|$|The cell–cell {{adhesion}} molecule N-cadherin, with its associated catenins, is expressed by differentiating skeletal muscle and its precursors. Although N-cadherin's role in later events of skeletal myogenesis such as adhesion during myoblast fusion is well established, less {{is known about}} its role in earlier events such as commitment and differentiation. Using an in vitro model system, we have determined that N-cadherin– mediated <b>adhesion</b> <b>enhances</b> skeletal muscle differentiation in three-dimensional cell aggregates. We transfected the cadherin-negative BHK fibroblastlike cell line with N-cadherin. Expression of exogenous N-cadherin upregulated endogenous β-catenin and induced strong cell–cell adhesion. When BHK cells were cultured as three-dimensional aggregates, N-cadherin enhanced withdrawal from the cell cycle and stimulated differentiation into skeletal muscle as measured by increased expression of sarcomeric myosin and the 12 / 101 antigen. In contrast, N-cadherin did not stimulate differentiation of BHK cells in monolayer cultures. The effect of N-cadherin was not unique since E-cadherin also increased the level of sarcomeric myosin in BHK aggregates. However, a nonfunctional mutant N-cadherin that increased the level of β-catenin failed to promote skeletal muscle differentiation suggesting an adhesion-competent cadherin is required. Our results suggest that cadherin-mediated cell–cell interactions during embryogenesis can dramatically influence skeletal myogenesis...|$|R
30|$|Conclusions: Manipulation of {{intraperitoneal}} structures {{during surgery}} <b>enhances</b> <b>adhesion</b> formation at trauma sites, confirming {{the model that}} the peritoneal cavity is a cofactor in adhesion formation. Dexamethasone decreases manipulation-enhanced adhesions. Surgical experience and tissue manipulation quantitatively and qualitatively influence adhesion formation during surgery.|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{producing}} extremely adhesive polypyrrole film on Titanium (Ti) substrate was investigated. The Ti substrate was chemically pretreated and then modified by polydopamine (PDA), the polypyrrole film synthesized by electrochemical method on the treated Ti substrate displayed good <b>adhesion</b> and <b>enhanced</b> anticorrosion performance. The {{study of the}} corrosion process was conducted through open circuit potential, tafel polarization and alternating current impedance test. The adhesive polypyrrole film coated titanium showed higher positive shift in corrosion potential and lower corrosion rate, indicating the great enhanced anti-corrosion performance...|$|R
