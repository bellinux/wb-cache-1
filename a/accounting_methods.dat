5|$|Spain had a {{comparatively}} low debt level among advanced economies {{prior to the}} crisis. Its public debt relative to GDP in 2010 was only 60%, more than 20 points less than Germany, France or the US, and more than 60 points less than Italy, Ireland or Greece. Debt was largely avoided by the ballooning tax revenue from the housing bubble, which helped accommodate a decade of increased government spending without debt accumulation. When the bubble burst, Spain spent {{large amounts of money}} on bank bailouts. In May 2012, Bankia received a 19 billion euro bailout, on top of the previous 4.5 billion euros to prop up Bankia. Questionable <b>accounting</b> <b>methods</b> disguised bank losses. During September 2012, regulators indicated that Spanish banks required €59 billion (US$77 billion) in additional capital to offset losses from real estate investments.|$|E
5|$|In {{central and}} {{northern}} Italy and in Flanders, {{the rise of}} towns that were to a degree self-governing stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations. Commercial cities {{on the shores of}} the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League, and the Italian Maritime republics such as Venice, Genoa, and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean. Great trading fairs were established and flourished in northern France during the period, allowing Italian and German merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants. In the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the Far East were pioneered, famously described in The Travels of Marco Polo written by one of the traders, Marco Polo (d. 1324). Besides new trading opportunities, agricultural and technological improvements enabled an increase in crop yields, which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand. Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money, and gold coinage was again minted in Europe, first in Italy and later in France and other countries. New forms of commercial contracts emerged, allowing risk to be shared among merchants. <b>Accounting</b> <b>methods</b> improved, partly through the use of double-entry bookkeeping; letters of credit also appeared, allowing easy transmission of money.|$|E

The people of that time relied on primitive <b>accounting</b> <b>methods</b> to record the growth of crops and herds. Because there was a natural season to farming and herding, it was easy to count and determine if a surplus had been gained after the crops had been harvested or the young animals weaned.|$|E

25|$|Entrepreneurship was {{exemplified}} by the career of John Northway (1848–1926). Beginning as a tailor in a small town, he moved to Toronto and soon developed a chain of department stores.

500|$|Moses Finley was {{the chief}} proponent of the primitivist view that the Roman economy was [...] "underdeveloped and underachieving," [...] {{characterized}} by subsistence agriculture; urban centres that consumed more than they produced in terms of trade and industry; low-status artisans; slowly developing technology; and a [...] "lack of economic rationality." [...] Current views are more complex. Territorial conquests permitted a large-scale reorganization of land use that resulted in agricultural surplus and specialization, particularly in north Africa. Some cities were known for particular industries or commercial activities, and the scale of building in urban areas indicates a significant construction industry. Papyri preserve complex <b>accounting</b> <b>methods</b> that suggest elements of economic rationalism, and the Empire was highly monetized. Although the means of communication and transport were limited in antiquity, transportation in the 1st and 2nd centuries expanded greatly, and trade routes connected regional economies. The supply contracts for the army, which pervaded {{every part of the}} Empire, drew on local suppliers near the base (castrum), throughout the province, and across provincial borders. The Empire is perhaps best thought of as a network of regional economies, based on a form of [...] "political capitalism" [...] in which the state monitored and regulated commerce to assure its own revenues. Economic growth, though not comparable to modern economies, was greater than that of most other societies prior to industrialization.|$|E

40|$|The {{reasons why}} {{managers}} make certain <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> choices have been explored by accounting researchers for some time. For over ten years, {{much of this}} research {{has been driven by}} positive accounting theory, which is based on the underlying assumption that managers act rationally to maximize their own personal wealth when making <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> choices. This study is an initial attempt to extend positive accounting theory research to a not-for-profit setting; specifically, the choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> for endowment investments by colleges and universities is examined. The three objectives of this study are: 1) to determine if the findings of previous research in positive accounting theory hold in the college and university industry, 2) to determine if other institutional characteristics are associated with the <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> used for endowment investments, and 3) to provide information to policymakers regarding the accounting for long-term investment by not-for-profit organizations. Data were obtained from 162 four-year colleges and universities. Two regression models were developed to explain the variation in the <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> used for investments. The first model contained five variables related to positive accounting theory and the second model contained five variables related to other institutional characteristics. The results of the first model indicate that the choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> for endowment investments is related to the factors suggested by positive accounting theory. Government regulations and bonus plan provisions factors were significant and of the expected sign. The political costs factor was also significant but not of the expected sign. The debt covenants factor was not significant. The results of the second model indicate that the choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> for endowment investments is related to other institutional characteristics. Specifically, the model found that location, asset allocation in equity investments, and the institution 2 ̆ 7 s auditor had a statistically significant influence on the choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>method.</b> The research indicates that there are systematic differences in the choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> for not-for-profit organizations similar to those explained by positive accounting theory for for-profit organizations. Additional institutional characteristics were also found to influence accounting choice, which warrant further research...|$|R

2500|$|Standard cost {{accounting}} uses ratios called efficiencies that compare the labour and materials actually {{used to produce}} a good with those that the same goods would have required under [...] "standard" [...] conditions. As long as actual and standard conditions are similar, few problems arise. Unfortunately, standard cost <b>accounting</b> <b>methods</b> developed about 100 years ago, when labor comprised the most important cost in manufactured goods. Standard methods continue to emphasize labor efficiency even though that resource now constitutes a (very) small part of cost in most cases.|$|E
2500|$|The fourth {{five-year plan}} {{continued}} the previous plan's emphasis on agricultural growth {{and expansion of}} exports and light industry. Efforts to promote socialist transformation were to continue, but at a gradual pace and [...] "by appropriate forms." [...] Development aid continued to come primarily from the former Soviet Union and other Communist countries. [...] In 1978, Vietnam became fully integrated into the Communist world planning and development structure, and its five-year plans were coordinated with those of its Communist partners. Planned Soviet outlays for the 1986–90 period totaled some $11–13 billion. This aid and trade waned with {{the decline of the}} USSR, with the full cutoff occurring in 1991. [...] The country's new economic emphasis, Doi Moi, was instituted by Nguyễn Văn Linh following the sixth national party congress in 1986. [...] His plan included policy and structural reforms for a market-based economic system: price decontrol (liberalized prices), currency devaluation, private sector expansion by de-collectivizing agriculture, legal recognition of private business, new foreign investment laws, autonomy of state enterprises, business <b>accounting</b> <b>methods,</b> devolution of government decision-making in industry to enterprise level, and limiting government participation to macroeconomic issues. Implementation of these policies was achieved with varied success.|$|E
2500|$|The third, and {{practically}} most important strategy for creditor protection, was {{to require that}} dividends and other returns to shareholders could only be made, generally speaking, if a company had profits. The concept of [...] "profit" [...] is defined by law as having assets above the amount that shareholders, who initially bought shares from the company, contributed {{in return for their}} shares. For example, a company could launch its business with 1000 shares (for public companies, called an [...] "IPO" [...] or initial public offering) each with a nominal value of 1 penny, and an issue price of £1. Shareholders would buy the £1 shares, and if all are sold, £1000 would become the company's [...] "legal capital". Profits are whatever the company makes on top of that £1000, though as a company continues to trade, the market price of shares could well be going up to £2 or £10, or indeed fall to 50 pence or some other number. The Companies Act 2006 states in section 830 that dividends, or any other kind of distribution, can only be given out from surplus profits beyond the legal capital. It is generally the decision of the board of directors, affirmed by a shareholder resolution, whether to declare a dividend or perhaps simply retain the earnings and invest them back into the business to grow and expand. The calculation of companies' assets and liabilities, losses and profits, will follow the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the UK, but this is not an objective, scientific process: a variety of different <b>accounting</b> <b>methods</b> can be used which can lead to different assessments of when a profit exists. The prohibition on falling below the legal capital applies to [...] "distributions" [...] in any form, and so [...] "disguised" [...] distributions are also caught. This has been held to include, for example, an unwarranted salary payment to a director's wife when she had not worked, and a transfer of a property within a company group at half its market value. A general principle, however, recently expounded in Progress Property Co Ltd v Moorgarth Group Ltd is that if a transaction is negotiated in good faith and at arm's length, then it may not be unwound, and this is apparently so even if it means that creditors have been [...] "ripped off". If distributions are made without meeting the law's criteria, then a company has a claim to recover the money from any recipients. They are liable as constructive trustees, which probably mirrors the general principles of any action in unjust enrichment. This means that liability is probably strict, subject to a change of position defence, and the rules of tracing will apply if assets wrongfully paid out of the company have been passed on. For example, in It’s A Wrap (UK) Ltd v Gula the directors of a bankrupt company argued that they had been unaware that dividend payments they paid themselves were unlawful (as there had not in fact been profits) because their tax advisers had said it was okay. The Court of Appeal held that ignorance of the law was not a defence. A contravention existed so long as one ought to have known of the facts that show a dividend would contravene the law. Directors can similarly be liable for breach of duty, and so to restore the money wrongfully paid away, if they failed to take reasonable care.|$|E

40|$|Accounting for {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emissions of nations {{is essential to}} understanding their importance to global climate change and help inform the policymaking on global GHG mitigation. Previous studies have made efforts to evaluate direct GHG emissions of nations (a. k. a. production-based <b>accounting</b> <b>method)</b> and GHG emissions caused by the final consumption of nations (a. k. a. consumption-based <b>accounting</b> <b>method),</b> but overlooked downstream GHG emissions enabled by primary inputs of individual nations and sectors (a. k. a. income-based <b>accounting</b> <b>method).</b> Here we show that the income-based <b>accounting</b> <b>method</b> reveals new GHG emission profiles for nations and sectors. The rapid development of mining industries drives income-based GHG emissions of resource-exporting nations (e. g., Australia, Canada, and Russia) during 1995 – 2009. Moreover, the rapid development of sectors producing basic materials and providing financial intermediation services drives income-based GHG emissions of developing nations (e. g., China, Indonesia, India, and Brazil) during this period. The income-based accounting can support supply side policy decisions and provide additional information for determining GHG emission quotas based on cumulative emissions of nations and designing policies for shared responsibilities...|$|R
