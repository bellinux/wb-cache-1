Application of such liquids allows to simplify equipment and decrease its cost, to increase accuracy of workpieces treatment by elimination of additional processing of workpieces base surfaces. It is proposed to set the workpiece not on supports of machine-tools but on the layer of rheological liquid hardened in outer magnetic field. At the same time contact pressure of rheological medium on side surface provides slip resistance caused by the forces appearing during treatment. The article contains calculated dependences for definition of forces holding the workpiece on machine table, being fully or partially submerged into ferromagnetic medium during mechanical processing.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend a shallow parser [6] with prepositional phrase {{attachment}}. Although the PP attachment task is a well-studied task in a discriminative learning context, {{it is mostly}} addressed {{in the context of}} artificial situations like the quadruple classification task [18] in which only two possible attachment sites, each time a noun or a verb, are possible. In this paper we provide a method to evaluate the task in a more natural situation, making it possible to compare the approach to full statistical parsing approaches. First, we show how to extract anchor-pp pairs from parse trees in the GENIA and WSJ treebanks. Next, we discuss the extension of the shallow parser with a PP-attacher. We compare the PP attachment module with a statistical full parsing approach [4] and analyze the results.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{suitability}} of a short pre-stimulation (P) for 15 s followed by a latency period (L) of 30 s before cluster <b>attachment</b> for <b>machine</b> milking. In addition we tested the effect of a periodic reduction of the vacuum under the teat (VR) during the massage phase from 43 kPa to 12 - 15 kPa on milking characteristics and teat tissue condition. The study was carried out in 9 cows in a cross-over design. Animals were milked twice daily, and each of the 4 treatment combinations was used for six subsequent milkings (P+L vs. continuous P, and standard pulsation vs. VR, respectively). Milk flow was recorded during all experimental milkings. Longitudinal ultrasound cross sections of the teat were performed by B-mode ultrasound after the last milking of each treatment at 0, 5, and 15 min after the end of milking, respectively. None of the evaluated milking characteristics (total milk yield, main milking time, peak flow rate, average milk flow) differed between treatments. Teat measures as obtained by ultrasound cross sections showed no significant difference if individual treatments were compared at the three time points individually. However, teat wall thickness (TWT) tended to be smaller in VR vs. non-VR treatments at 5 min after milking (P= 0 · 05). In conclusion, teat preparation consisting of a short stimulation followed by a latency period represents a similarly efficient pre-stimulation as a continuous pre-stimulation. VR seems to reduce the load on the teat tissue during milking and thus reduces the development of oedema and hence a less pronounced increase of TWT while milking characteristics are similar with or without V...|$|R

30|$|Bloom’s 2 -sigma problem (Bloom, 1984) – the {{challenge}} to achieve, through more efficient teaching methods, at least the same 2 sigma difference that is seen between achievements of those taught in conventional classroom settings and those taught via one-to-one tutoring – remains unmet after nearly 35  years of concerted effort. This is {{not because of any}} methodological or technical process advantage in one-to-one teaching, but because it provides the smartest learning environment we have yet to invent. One-to-one teaching is the condition under which learning occurs, not the way that teaching is performed. Bloom and many successors have sought to compare it with methods of teaching such as mastery learning, problem-based learning, or active learning, but such comparisons are unfair because the environment’s effectiveness is largely because virtually any pedagogical methods can be used, allowing the tutor to adapt very precisely {{to the needs of the}} learner in real time, changing pedagogy, pace, topic, and so on as needed. Within a limited domain, a sufficiently smart artificial general intelligence (AGI) might one day adapt as effectively, though none has not yet come close, and realistic extrapolations put AGI at least 30  years away if it ever occurs at all (Goertzel, 2014). Even if it did, a much less easily duplicable benefit is the ease with which a student may establish a relationship with the tutor. This matters. A human tutor may model behaviours, reassure, enthuse, and use emotional responses of many kinds to help guide, engage, and motivate a learner. A human tutor offers companionship. A teacher’s compassion and caring, whether expressed in gentle encouragement or even through impatience or annoyance, can be critical to successful learning. While a smart machine might simulate such things for a little while, and it is not that unusual for humans to form something like emotional <b>attachments</b> to <b>machines,</b> for now at least it is hard to imagine that a student would care too much about the feelings of a computer when compared with a real human being, and worrisome that they might (Turkle, 2011).|$|R
40|$|A new machine {{system has}} been designed, {{developed}} and evaluated for extensive circle spraying of oil palms (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) {{in an effort to}} overcome the inefficient spraying problem with the conventional spraying system. The machine system consists of a four-wheeled drive 4 WD prime mover with front mounted <b>machine</b> <b>attachments</b> for the circle spraying operation. The configuration of the circle spraying attachment consists of a hexagonal curved spray boom, lifting arm, opening-tilting mechanism unit, storage tank, spray pump, solid cone nozzles, and associate hydraulic system. Field performance tests on the machine system showed an average effective field capacity of 7. 89 ha per man per day and when compared to the earlier reported effective field capacity of the walking spray-operated equipment using Serena LT 16 knapsack sprayer; a difference of 1. 97 time for circle spraying of mature palms grove. Reduction in the human energy expenditure of 101. 28 kJ man- 1 h- 1 or 10. 68 % but an increase in the spraying cost of 1. 53 USD ha- 1 or 24. 9 % were obtained with the machine system against the walking spraying-operated equipment using Serena LT 16 knapsack sprayer. Justification for machine system to be cost effective could be satisfied if the present effective field capacity is increased to 1. 263 time with good skilled operator or if the current R&D cost is reduced to 0. 41 time. This is because the improved field capacity of new machine system could not rationalize its current R&D cost.

40|$|Machining is an {{important}} excess-metal removal process in manufacturing. In spite of the considerable effort on metal cutting research, the mechanics of this process at a nano scale are not fully understood. Hence metal cutting research is a challenging field and is currently attracting the attention of workers {{in the field of}} plasticity of metals as well as those concerned with the more immediate problems in practice. Nano scale grooves such as nano channels and nano slots have many applications in semiconductor and biomedical industries, which are growing to meet the increasing demands of nano technology. Whenever nanomachining is performed to produce a nano scale groove on a metal surface, abrasive wear occurs. The ultimate aim of the analysis of the mechanics of metal machining at a nano scale is to understand the basic phenomena, to predict how the materials deforms, which mechanism is dominant and what machining parameters (depth of cut, machining velocity) are required for a given material and for a given machining condition to produce a nano scale groove. In this research, nanomachining was utilized to investigate the abrasive wear mechanism that produces a nano scale groove on metal surfaces. Two different tools (Berkovich and Conical) with the same tip radius of 100 nm but of different edge geometries were used to machine both polycrystalline materials and single crystal materials with a nano indenter equipped with a nano scratching <b>attachment.</b> During the <b>machining</b> operations, the generated normal and cutting forces were measured as a function of nano scale machining parameters. It was found that the generated forces (normal and cutting) increased with an increase in depth of cut; however, there was no significant effect on the generated forces due to the variation in machining velocities. In nano scale machining, the percentage of elastic recovery revealed that the deformation mechanisms were identified as elastoplastic in nature as opposed to the well-established completely plastic mode of traditional machining operations. The pile up volume due to elastoplastic deformation was utilized to distinguish between the ploughing and the cutting modes of abrasive wear mechanism. The percentage values of these two mechanisms were determined and utilized to obtain the dominant mode of an abrasive wear mechanism for producing a nano scale groove and to correlate this abrasive wear mechanism with the co-efficient of friction (µ) in different machining conditions. As a result of machining operations, the machined surface retains residual stress and strain. The type of residual stress, whether tensile or compressive, depends on the used machining parameters. It is however difficult to measure residual stress and strain at a nano scale machining level. Therefore, to understand the material deformation behaviour and their effect on the machined surface, numerical modelling of nano scale machining process was developed by using a novel mesh free modelling tool of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) ...|$|R
