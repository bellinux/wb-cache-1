5|$|The {{operation}} {{became the}} most intense air/ground battle waged during the Cold War period; {{it was the most}} difficult such campaign fought by the United States since the aerial bombardment of Germany during World War II. Supported by communist allies, North Vietnam fielded a potent mixture of sophisticated air-to-air and surface-to-air weapons that created {{one of the most effective}} <b>air</b> <b>defenses</b> ever faced by American military aviators.|$|E
5|$|In November 1959, {{to improve}} the aircraft's combat {{capabilities}} in the changing strategic environment, SAC initiated the Big Four modification program (also known as Modification 1000) for all operational B-52s except early B models. The program was completed by 1963. The four modifications were the ability to launch AGM-28 Hound Dog standoff nuclear missiles and ADM-20 Quail decoys, an advanced electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite, and upgrades to perform the all-weather, low-altitude (below 500feet or 150m) interdiction mission {{in the face of}} advancing Soviet missile-based <b>air</b> <b>defenses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Project Isinglass was {{developed}} {{as a result of}} the vulnerability of existing manned reconnaissance aircraft, such as the Lockheed U-2 and the Lockheed A-12, to Soviet <b>air</b> <b>defenses</b> in the early 1960s, catalysed by the shooting down in May 1960 of Francis Gary Powers. Although there were continuing plans to overfly the Soviet Union with the A-12 – referred to by the CIA as Project Oxcart – these failed to come to pass, and the CIA began plans for an aircraft with superior performance to replace Oxcart.|$|E

50|$|CADF was an intermediate-level {{command and}} control {{organization}} of <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Command. Its origins date to 1 March 1949 when Continental Air Command (ConAC) reorganized <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Command when it became an operating agency. <b>Air</b> <b>defense</b> units within the Continental United States (CONUS) {{were given to the}} Eastern and Western <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Liaison Groups, with Western and Eastern <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Forces activated on 1 September 1949.|$|R
5|$|The Japanese {{government}} {{was concerned about}} the results of the March firebombing attacks as the raids had demonstrated that the Japanese military was unable to protect the nation's airspace. As well as the extensive physical damage in the targeted cities, the attacks also caused increased absenteeism as civilians were afraid to leave their homes to work in factories which might be bombed. Japanese <b>air</b> <b>defenses</b> were reinforced in response to the firebombing raids, but remained inadequate; 450 fighters were assigned to defensive duties in April.|$|E
5|$|While {{the raid}} did not achieve its aims, it had other effects. It raised Japanese civilians' {{awareness}} that their country was being defeated and received unduly positive media {{coverage in the}} United States. Intelligence gathered by the B-29s also revealed weaknesses in Japan's <b>air</b> <b>defenses</b> and the raid {{was the first of}} many on Japan. Yawata was attacked again by B-29s operating from China on 20August 1944 and much of the city was destroyed in a fire bombing raid conducted by B-29s based in the Mariana Islands on 8August 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, the USAF began {{operating}} two-seat North American F-100F Super Sabres specially {{equipped for}} Suppression of Enemy <b>Air</b> <b>Defenses</b> mission in Vietnam. Nicknamed the Wild Weasel, these aircraft achieved {{a number of}} victories against North Vietnamese surface-to-air missile radars. The second crew member was a Navigator trained as an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) to decipher sensor information and guide the pilot towards the targets. However, the F-100F was an interim solution, since its limited payload often required multiple aircraft to conduct a successful strike; it also lacked the speed and endurance to effectively protect the F-105.|$|E

5|$|In September, Saville told Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington, and the {{assembled}} Air Force staff that America's <b>air</b> <b>defenses</b> were wholly inadequate. The Chiefs of Staff agreed that air defense {{was second in}} importance only to a strong retaliation force, one that would give pause to an aggressor. In November, Saville was named commanding general of ADC. He worked to combine it with Tactical Air Command (TAC) to form {{the backbone of the}} Continental Air Command (CONAC) organization. In February 1949, Saville updated the House Armed Services Committee on the necessity of radar air defense, and in March the Lashup plan was approved by Congress.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, {{detailing}} {{the plan of}} attack and command structure for the invasion. Hungary and Bulgaria were promised the Banat and Yugoslav Macedonia respectively and the Romanian army was asked not to take part, holding its position at the countries' border. Internal conflict in Hungary over the invasion plans between the army and Teleki led to the Prime Minister's suicide that same evening. Also on 3 April, Edmund Veesenmayer, representing the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, arrived in Zagreb {{in preparation for a}} regime change. Croatian pilot Vladimir Kren, a captain in the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, defected to the Germans on 3 April taking with him valuable information about the country's <b>air</b> <b>defenses.</b>|$|E
5|$|The F-4 Phantom II {{remained}} in {{use by the}} U.S. in the reconnaissance and Wild Weasel (Suppression of Enemy <b>Air</b> <b>Defenses)</b> roles in the 1991 Gulf War, finally leaving service in 1996. It was also the only aircraft used by both U.S. flight demonstration teams: the USAF Thunderbirds (F-4E) and the US Navy Blue Angels (F-4J). The F-4 was also operated by {{the armed forces of}} 11 other nations. Israeli Phantoms saw extensive combat in several Arab–Israeli conflicts, while Iran used its large fleet of Phantoms acquired before the fall of the Shah in the Iran–Iraq War. Phantoms remain in frontline service with four countries. Phantom production ran from 1958 to 1981, with a total of 5,195 built, making it the most produced American supersonic military aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with its}} {{assignment}} under SWC, Kirtland AFB received a related <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> mission for <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Command (ADC). Kirtland housed an ADC <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Detection Centers (ADDC) {{which would then}} alert the Fighter-Interceptor squadrons and the <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Control Center (ADCC) for unknown aircraft intrusions in ADC monitored airspace. The ADCC would then alert ADC’s Central <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Force, which consisted of the Western <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Force WADF, the Central <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Force CADF, and the Eastern <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Force EADF. Kirtland hosted {{one of the first}} ADCCs in the country, which was under construction at Kirtland in late 1950 and operational before the close of 1951 as part of the 34th <b>Air</b> Division (<b>Defense).</b> ADCCs were innovative buildings that were proto-hardened and designed for protection from atomic, biological, and chemical warfare. A single ADCC controlled multiple FISs for its <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> jurisdiction. Along with the ADCC at KAFB was a corresponding ADDC.|$|R

5|$|The four {{objectives}} of the operation (which evolved over time) were to boost the sagging morale of the Saigon regime in the Republic of Vietnam, to persuade North Vietnam to cease its support for the communist insurgency in South Vietnam without actually taking any ground forces into communist North Vietnam, to destroy North Vietnam's transportation system, industrial base, and <b>air</b> <b>defenses,</b> and to halt the flow of men and material into South Vietnam. Attainment of these objectives was made difficult by both the restraints imposed upon the U.S. and its allies by Cold War exigencies and by the military aid and assistance received by North Vietnam from its communist allies, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and North Korea.|$|E
5|$|After O'Grady {{was shot}} down, {{tensions}} increased greatly between NATO and the Bosnian Serbs. A number of US commanders called for immediate retaliatory air strikes; however, the Serbs still held {{the majority of}} the hostages seized after the bombing of Pale. The threat to the hostages prevented NATO from acting more forcefully, and the Serbs released 121 hostages immediately after the incident in an effort to cool tensions. Nonetheless, the situation remained explosive for the next six days until O'Grady was rescued on 8 June by the 3rd Battalion 8th Marines 2nd Marine Division, ending the calls for immediate offensive action. Shortly thereafter, the Serbs released the remaining hostages. As a result of the incident, NATO ordered that all further sorties be accompanied by aircraft designed for suppression of enemy <b>air</b> <b>defenses</b> (SEAD).|$|E
5|$|On 4 June 2011, Apaches struck targets within Libya for {{the first}} time, {{destroying}} a radar site and an armed checkpoint {{near the town of}} Brega. Further precision strikes were launched by Apaches, typical targets were mobile <b>air</b> <b>defenses,</b> and were occasionally engaged by AK-47 fire from ground troops. In early June, Apaches conducted attacks on Gaddafi loyalists assaulting the town of Misrata. On 13 June, British Apaches destroyed several inflatable boats with 30mm cannon fire, believed to be Libyan Special Forces, before engaging and destroying multiple vehicles along the coastline, including an anti-aircraft system. On 25 June, in coordination with RAF Panavia Tornado strikes, Apaches attacked loyalist infantry and vehicles around Brega and its airfield. On 1 July, British Apaches were reportedly involved in a 'fierce' battle at the town of Khoms. On 2 July, Apaches destroyed several tanks and a bunker at a military camp near Zawiya. On 5 August, Apaches participated in the rebel push for the town of Zliten was reported.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, in {{response}} to the threat of long-range Soviet bombers, the U.S. and Canada signed a treaty creating the bi-national North American <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Command (NORAD), responsible for both countries’ <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> and <b>air</b> sovereignty. <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Sectors were established soon after, including the New York <b>Air</b> <b>Defense</b> Sector (NYADS) headquartered at McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey. Responsibility for <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> of the Northeast changed with various reorganizations. In 1983, the 24th Air Division was assigned to Griffiss Air Force Base to provide <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> for the Northeast. In 1987, NEADS was activated and co-located with the 24th AD. NEADS took sole responsibility for <b>air</b> <b>defense</b> mission when the air divisions were inactivated in the early 1990s.|$|R
5|$|Operated by Germany and Italy, the ECR (Electric Combat / Reconnaissance) is a Tornado variant {{devoted to}} Suppression of Enemy <b>Air</b> <b>Defenses</b> (SEAD) missions. It was first {{delivered}} on 21 May 1990. The ECR has sensors to detect radar usage and {{is equipped with}} anti-radiation AGM-88 HARM missiles. The Luftwaffe's 35 ECRs were delivered new, while Italy received 16 converted IDSs. Italian Tornado ECRs differ from the Luftwaffe aircraft as they lack built-in reconnaissance capability and use RecceLite reconnaissance pods, also only Luftwaffe ECRs are equipped with RB199 Mk.105 engine, which has a slightly higher thrust rating. The German ECRs do not carry a cannon. The RAF uses the IDS version in the SEAD role instead of the ECR. It also modified several of its Tornado F.3s to undertake the mission.|$|E
5|$|The 1967 war {{severely}} depleted Egypt's military strength, as most {{of their}} air force and a large quantity of equipment was destroyed. Soviet assistance helped the Egyptian military to start the rebuilding of their armed forces shortly after the war, and by September 1968 Egyptian ground forces sufficiently recovered to challenge the Israeli presence east of the Suez canal. The War of Attrition began with Egyptian artillery barrages and commando raids into the Sinai, which were countered by deep-striking Israeli airstrikes and heli-borne raids into Egypt. Egypt's inability to challenge Israeli air superiority led to the deployment of Soviet-operated air-defense assets to protect parts of Egypt's interior, deterring the Israelis from launching their deep penetration raids and allowing the Egyptians to rebuild their <b>air</b> <b>defenses.</b> The defensive upgrades incurred increasing Israeli air losses, leading to an August 1970 ceasefire that lasted until 1973. Nasser died in September 1970 and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed Have Blue {{was born}} out of a {{requirement}} to evade radar detection. During the Vietnam War, radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) posed a significant threat to US aircraft. As such, strike aircraft during the war often required support aircraft to perform combat air patrols and suppression of enemy <b>air</b> <b>defenses</b> (SEAD). The 1973 Yom Kippur War again highlighted the vulnerability of aircraft to SAMs – the Israeli Air Force lost 109 aircraft in 18 days. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union developed an integrated defense network, central to which were medium- to long-range surveillance radars. SAMs and AAAs would be set up around key locations to defend them from incoming enemy aircraft. If the loss ratio of Israel during the Yom Kippur War was experienced by NATO forces during a military confrontation with the Warsaw Pact, NATO aircraft numbers would be depleted within two weeks.|$|E
