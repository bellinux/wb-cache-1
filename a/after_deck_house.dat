5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941 the mitrailleuse de 25 mm contre-aéroplanes Modèle 1940, a naval {{adaptation}} of an Army anti-aircraft gun, became available. So Volta was modified between August and November 1941 with two single 25mm guns where the Hotchkiss machine guns had been mounted. Their platform was widened and one additional Browning machine gun was added {{on each side of}} the platform. The Hotchkiss guns were moved to the upper deck on either side of the <b>after</b> <b>deck</b> <b>house.</b> A degaussing cable was added during this same refit. Later in the year the SS 6 sonar was scheduled to be replaced by a French copy of the British ASDIC, but it was still sitting on the dockside when Volta was scuttled in Toulon Harbour when the Germans tried to seize the fleet on 27 November 1942 to prevent it from defecting to the Allies. She was raised on 20 May 1943 by the Italians, but no effort was made to repair her. Volta was bombed and sunk on 24 November 1943 and later refloated and scrapped in 1948.|$|E

The hangar was later reused and rebuilt as the prototype for the McCann Rescue Chamber, a diving bell for rescuing crewmen from sunken submarines.|$|R
50|$|The {{first years}} of World War II had shown that British destroyers were ill-equipped to deal with {{concentrated}} air attacks, and the Royal Navy suffered heavy losses as a result. In 1941 urgent consideration of the problem led to a naval staff requirement for {{a new class of}} large fleet destroyer with High Angle (HA) twin guns and an HA control system. It was decided that this main armament would be set forward in a superfiring configuration for all guns to engage one target. Arcs of fire were increased by setting the bridge structure further aft than normal. The proposed anti-aircraft (AA) armament were eight 40/60 mm guns in twin mountings set atop the middle and <b>after</b> <b>deck</b> <b>houses</b> to give all around, overlapping arcs of fire. These were to be supplemented by 20 mm guns positioned variously around the ship. Eight 21 in torpedo tubes were to be carried in two quadruple mounts. A/S armament called for two depth charge rails and four depth charge throwers to be fitted. A new feature was the first use of stabilisers in a destroyer, allowing a steady platform for AA gunnery.|$|R

5000|$|Halford {{was one of}} {{the three}} Fletcher-class destroyers to be {{completed}} (out of six planned) with a catapult for a float plane, the others being [...] and [...] The catapult and an aircraft crane were located just aft of the number 2 smokestack, in place of the after torpedo tube mount, 5 inch mount number 3, and the 2nd deck of the <b>after</b> <b>deck</b> <b>house</b> which normally carried a twin 40 mm anti-aircraft gun on most ships of the class. (The twin 40 mm mount was moved to the fantail, just forward of the depth charge racks, where most ships of the class carried 20 mm mounts.) It was intended that the float plane be used for scouting for the destroyer flotilla which the ship was attached to. It would be launched by the catapult, land on the water next to the ship, and be recovered by the aircraft crane. It turned out to be not operationally suitable for the intended purpose, and the three ships were ultimately converted to the standard Fletcher-class configuration.|$|E
40|$|Planing crafts were {{specifically}} designed to achieve relatively high speeds on the water. When a planing craft is running at high speed, dynamic pressure on the bottom makes the boat rise {{on the surface of}} the water. This reduces the area of the sinking surface of the boat to increase air resistance. Air resistance means the resistance that occurs when the hull and <b>deck</b> <b>house</b> over the surface of the water come in contact with the air current. In this paper, we carried out a CFD numerical analysis to find optimal <b>deck</b> <b>houses</b> that decreased air-resistance on the water when planing crafts are running at high speed.

5000|$|The New Year found Peary at Darwin, Australia. During January {{and a part}} of February, she {{operated}} out of Darwin, principally on anti-submarine patrol. On 15-16 February, Peary {{took part}} in a mission to transport reinforcements and supplies to Allied forces in Dutch Timor, but this was aborted after coming under intense air attack. On 19 February 1942 Darwin experienced a massive Japanese air attack. The Peary was attacked by Japanese dive bombers, and was struck by five bombs. The first bomb exploded on the fantail, the second, an incendiary, on the galley deck house; the third did not explode; the fourth hit forward and set off the forward ammunition magazines; the fifth, another incendiary, exploded in the after engine room. A [...]30 caliber machine gun on the <b>after</b> <b>deck</b> <b>house</b> and a [...]50 caliber machine gun on the galley deck house fired until the last enemy plane flew away. Lost with the ship were 88 officers and men. The only senior survivor was her gunnery officer, Lieutenant W.J. Catlett. The USS Peary was the first destroyer of the Asiatic Fleet to be sunk in World War Two. She was struck from the Navy List on 8 May 1942.|$|E
5000|$|No {{more attacks}} {{occurred}} until 0425, 7 January, when enemy aircraft {{were picked up}} on radar. At 0450, one plane flying low to the water {{came in from the}} starboard quarter passing ahead of Hovey. A few moments later, another plane coming from the port beam was put on fire by Chandler. This plane passed very low over Hovey and crashed on the starboard beam. At 0455, the instant the burning plane crashed, Hovey was struck by a torpedo on her starboard side in the after engineroom. Lights and power were lost instantly.

50|$|Pringle {{was one of}} {{the three}} Fletcher-class destroyers to be built (out of 6 planned) with a {{catapult}} for a float plane. The catapult and an aircraft crane were located just aft of the number 2 smokestack, in place of the after torpedo tube mount, 5 inch mount number 3, and the 2nd deck of the <b>after</b> <b>deck</b> <b>house</b> which normally carried a twin 40 mm anti-aircraft gun on most ships of the class.

It would be launched by the catapult, land on the water next to the ship, and be recovered by the aircraft crane. Pringle was the first of five ships that eventually received the catapult to use it operationally. Due to design problems with the derrick, Pringle could not recover the Kingfisher airplane. Two ships constructed in 1943, the USS Stevens and the USS Halford, had redesigned derricks. Stevens became the first of the five ships to successfully launch and recover the plane. All were ultimately converted to the standard Fletcher-class configuration.|$|E
