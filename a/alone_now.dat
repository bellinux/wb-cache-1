The Inquisitor, Petrus Zwicker, conducted severe persecutions in Steyr, Enns, Hartberg, Sopron and Vienna between 1391 and 1402.

25|$|The island's {{economy has}} grown {{significantly}} {{over the last}} decade in key areas of innovation. Aerospace, Bioscience, ICT and Renewable energy have been a focus for growth and diversification. Aerospace <b>alone</b> <b>now</b> accounts for over 25% of the province's international exports and is the island's fourth largest industry at $355 million in annual sales. The Bioscience industry employs over 1300 people and generates over $150 million in sales.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{founding}} of the People's Republic, industrial development has been given considerable attention; as of 2011 46% of China's national output continued to be devoted to investment; a percentage far higher than any other nation. Among the various industrial branches the machine-building and metallurgical industries have received the highest priority. These two areas <b>alone</b> <b>now</b> account for about 20–30 percent of the total gross value of industrial output. In these, as in most other areas of industry, however, innovation has generally suffered {{at the hands of a}} system that has rewarded increases in gross output rather than improvements in variety, sophistication and quality. China, therefore, still imports significant quantities of specialized steels. Overall industrial output has grown at an average rate of more than 10 percent per year, having surpassed all other sectors in economic growth and degree of modernization. Some heavy industries and products deemed to be of national strategic importance remain state-owned, but an increasing proportion of lighter and consumer-oriented manufacturing firms are privately held or are private-state joint ventures.|$|E

25|$|The Geek Chorus {{enters and}} informs the {{audience}} that Spider-Man has defeated his ultimate enemy, so their story is complete. Miss Arrow is convinced {{that they are not}} finished, because Spider-Man's real ultimate enemy should be unbeatable. So they introduce several villains which Spider-Man dispatches: Carnage, Swarm, Kraven the Hunter, Electro, The Lizard, and Swiss Miss (whom Miss Arrow invents on the spot). Throughout this super villain parade, we also learn that Peter and MJ have formed a relationship. With all of these villains afoot, Peter is exhausted and not paying much attention to her or anyone else in his life ("Spider-Man Rising"). As Peter sleeps one night, Arachne invades his dreams. She realizes that she will no longer be <b>alone</b> <b>now</b> that there is another spider to share her darkness ("Turn Off the Dark"). She begins to weave illusions in his mind, and Peter can't tell the difference between the dream and reality when he awakes. MJ becomes completely fed up with Peter's constant lateness and disregard for her after he does not show up for her new play ("Walk Away"). That night, he decides to abandon Spider-Man forever.|$|E

500|$|The longest-lasting {{inhabitants}} of Titanic {{are likely to}} be bacteria and archaea which have colonized the metal hull of the ship. They have produced [...] "reddish-brown stalactites of rust [...] down as much as several feet, looking like long needle-like icicles", as Robert Ballard has put it. The formations, which Ballard dubbed [...] "rusticles", are extremely fragile and disintegrate in a cloud of particles if touched. The bacteria consume the iron in the hull, oxidizing it and leaving rust particles behind as a waste product. To protect themselves from the seawater, they secrete an acidic viscous slime that flows where gravity takes it, carrying ferric oxides and hydroxides. These form the rusticles. When scientists were able to retrieve a rusticle, it was discovered that it was far more complex than had been imagined, with complex systems of roots infiltrating the metal, interior channels, bundles of fibers, pores and other structures. Charles Pellegrino comments that they seem more akin to [...] "levels of tissue organization found in sponges or mosses {{and other members of the}} animal or plant kingdoms." [...] The bacteria are estimated to be consuming Titanics hull at the rate of [...] per day, which is about [...] per hour or [...] per minute. Roy Collimore, a microbiologist, estimates that the bow <b>alone</b> <b>now</b> supports some 650 tons of rusticles and that they will have devoured fifty per cent of the hull within 200 years.|$|E

2500|$|As HAART became widespread, fixed dose {{combinations}} {{were made}} available to ease the administration. Later, the term combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) gained favor with some physicians as a name more accurate for the current era, not conveying to patients any misguided idea {{of the nature of}} the therapy. Today multidrug, highly effective regimens are long since the default in ART, which is why they are increasingly called simply ART instead of HAART or cART. This retronymic process is linguistically comparable to the way that the words electronic computer and digital computer at first were needed to make useful distinctions in computing technology, but with the later irrelevance of the distinction, computer <b>alone</b> <b>now</b> covers their meaning. Thus as [...] "all computers are digital now", so [...] "all ART is combination ART now."

Since Adam was the head of the human race, he is held responsible for the evil that took place, for which reason the fall of man is referred to as the [...] "sin of Adam".
