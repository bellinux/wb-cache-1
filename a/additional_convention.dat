2500|$|On 12 August 1949, further {{revisions}} to the existing two Geneva Conventions were adopted. An <b>additional</b> <b>convention</b> [...] "for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea", now called the second Geneva Convention, was brought under the Geneva Convention umbrella as a successor to the 1907 Hague Convention X. The 1929 Geneva convention [...] "relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War" [...] {{may have been the}} second Geneva Convention from a historical point of view (because it was actually formulated in Geneva), but after 1949 it came to be called the third Convention because it came later chronologically than the Hague Convention. Reacting to the experience of World War II, the Fourth Geneva Convention, a new Convention [...] "relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War", was established. Also, the additional protocols of 8 June 1977 were intended to make the conventions apply to internal conflicts such as civil wars. Today, the four conventions and their added protocols contain more than 600 articles, a remarkable expansion when compared to the mere 10 articles in the first 1864 convention.|$|E

5000|$|A {{treaty was}} signed on July 8, 1893, in Mexico City, and an <b>additional</b> <b>convention</b> added on April 7, 1897.

An <b>additional</b> <b>convention</b> was signed in Paris on 3 December 1903.|$|E
50|$|The {{expansion}} of Bartle Hall {{was a significant}} technical challenge. Construction of the <b>additional</b> <b>convention</b> space was built over a continuously open six-lane freeway, Interstate 670, which runs underneath the convention center. Construction required the installation of four 300 ft tall pylons to support the facility's roof. The result {{was the creation of}} the largest, column-free convention environment in the world. The building also was designed and constructed to meet green building standards and achieved a LEED Silver rating, the first City of Kansas City, Missouri project to receive Silver LEED certification.|$|E
50|$|The Union Treaty is not exhaustive. For this reason, Article 19 of the Treaty {{provides}} that the Committee of Ministers may conclude <b>additional</b> <b>conventions.</b> These therefore constitute {{extensions of the}} Union Treaty.

The film, funded through crowd-sourcing via Kickstarter, was originally envisioned to follow voice actor and executive producer John de Lancie to the 2012 Summer BronyCon in New Jersey. The project raised much more than anticipated, allowing it to grow in scope to bring on Lauren Faust, Friendship Is Magic original creator, and Tara Strong, a principal voice actress on the show, as executive producers and to include <b>additional</b> <b>convention</b> footage from European conventions.|$|E

5000|$|During the Congress of Vienna on 21 January 1815 the British {{agreed to}} pay the Portuguese Prince Regent £300,000 in reparations for Portuguese ships seized by the British [...] "cruizers" [...] prior to 1 June 1814, {{on the basis that}} they were engaged in the slave trade. The next day they entered into a further treaty which {{prohibited}} Portuguese ships from engaging in the slave trade along the coast of Africa north of the equator. This was tied to a loan of £600,000 and the treaty was to be ratified within five months. [...] Over two years later on 28 July 1817 an <b>Additional</b> <b>Convention</b> was added which included the first provision for Mixed Commissions formed of an equal number of individuals of the two nations. One was to be located in a British possession and the other in a Portuguese possession, with one on the coast of Africa, and the other on the coast of Brazil. [...] A further Mixed Commission was also set up on a similar basis in London. While the treaty allowed Portuguese slave traders to continue their business south of the equator, the trade was forbidden to the north. The £300,000 mentioned in 1815 had not been paid, but the British {{agreed to pay}} it in two instalments of £150,000, as well as 5% interest since the earlier convention in January 1815.

50|$|A price can be {{computed}} {{for each of}} these valuations, depending on one's purpose. Often the purpose is assumed to be self-evident, being related to a specific transaction, and thus what the price of something is, is taken as obvious. But an object or activity can in reality be priced in many different ways, depending on what valuation is relevant, or what price is negotiated. In modern banking, there are literally hundreds of <b>additional</b> <b>conventions</b> used to value assets under a variety of conditions.|$|R

40|$|Many {{realistic}} decision aid {{problems are}} fraught with facets of ambiguity, uncertainty and conflict, which hamper {{the effectiveness of}} conventional and fuzzy preference modeling approaches, and command the use of more expressive representations. In the past, some authors have already identified Ginsberg’s/Fitting’s theory of bilattices as a naturally attractive candidate framework for representing uncertain and potentially conflicting preferences, yet none of the existing approaches addresses the real expressive power of bilattices, which lies hidden in their associated truth and knowledge orders. As a consequence, these approaches have to incorporate <b>additional</b> <b>conventions</b> and ‘tricks’ into their modus operandi, making the results unintuitive and/or tedious. By contrast, {{the aim of this}} paper is to demonstrate the potential of (rectangular) bilattices in encoding not just the problem statement, but also its generic solution strategy...|$|R
