5|$|It {{appeared}} <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> {{government might}} seize Lincoln for being insolvent. The investigation was, however, {{taking a long}} time. Keating was asking that Lincoln be given a lenient judgment by the FHLBB, {{so that it could}} limit its high risk investments and get into the safe (at the time) home mortgage business, thus allowing the business to survive. A letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was taking a long time. Keating now wanted the five senators to intervene with the FHLBB on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the album}} cites Tony Bongiovi and Tommy Ramone {{as the head}} producers, much of the album's {{production}} was done by Stasium; Johnny {{so far as to}} insist that Bongiovi was omnipresent during the band's recording sessions. Rocket to Russias final mastering was mainly done in Bongiovi's Power Station studio. Infamous record producer Phil Spector offered to fabricate Rocket to Russia, but the band declined, feeling <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> album would not be the same without Tommy and Bongiovi.|$|E
5|$|Burnside {{was given}} {{command of the}} Right Wing of the Army of the Potomac (the I Corps and his own IX Corps) {{at the start of}} the Maryland Campaign for the Battle of South Mountain, but McClellan {{separated}} the two corps at the Battle of Antietam, placing them on opposite ends of the Union battle line and returning Burnside to command of just the IX Corps. Burnside implicitly refused to give up his authority, and acted <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> corps commander was first Maj. Gen. Jesse L. Reno (killed at South Mountain) and then Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox, funneling orders through them to the corps. This cumbersome arrangement contributed to his slowness in attacking and crossing what is now called Burnside's Bridge on the southern flank of the Union line.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1140s the active {{phase of the}} civil war was over, barring the {{occasional}} outbreak of fighting. Many of the barons were making individual peace agreements with each other to secure their war gains and it increasingly appeared <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> English Church was considering promoting a peace treaty. On Louis VII's return from the Second Crusade in 1149, he became concerned about the growth of Geoffrey's power and the potential threat to his own possessions, especially if Henry could acquire the English crown. In 1150, Geoffrey made Henry the Duke of Normandy and Louis responded by putting forward King Stephen's son Eustace as the rightful heir to the duchy and launching a military campaign to remove Henry from the province. Henry's father advised him {{to come to terms with}} Louis and peace was made between them in August 1151 after mediation by Bernard of Clairvaux. Under the settlement Henry did homage to Louis for Normandy, accepting Louis as his feudal lord, and gave him the disputed lands of the Norman Vexin; in return, Louis recognised him as duke.|$|E
5|$|Danny Baranowsky, the game's {{composer}} and who previously worked with McMillen on Super Meat Boy, was involved early {{on with the}} project shortly {{after the completion of}} the first prototype. McMillen and Baranowsky worked back and forth, with McMillen providing artwork from the game and allowing Baranowsky to develop the musical themes based on that; this would often lead to McMillen creating more art to support the music as it progressed. Baranowsky had been drawn to The Binding of Isaac <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> game puts forth a dark tone, he stated it had rather silly undertones underneath and such that one could not take it too seriously. Some of the songs were inspired by classical choral music but modified to fit the theme of the game. Other works were inspired by boss fight songs composed by Nobuo Uematsu for the Final Fantasy series. Baranowsky also had additional time after finishing the main songs for the game to craft short additional tracks that were used for special rooms like shops and secret areas.|$|E
5|$|Hartley {{explained}} that Arthur would {{be aware of}} his powers {{at the beginning of}} the series and would have no problem using them for personal gain. Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe underwater, as well as have super strength while underwater. He also stated that exposure to water on land would give him powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is able to keep up with a fighter jet flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. is talking to Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that he felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the ability to communicate with sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weak around kryptonite in Smallville – if A.C. does not get water, he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore stories on land.|$|E

5|$|In December 1999, the Russian {{government}} outlined that it {{planned to}} purchase 164 aircraft by 2018. The Ukrainian government in October 2000 {{estimated that the}} country had a requirement for 65 aircraft. By then, the Russian government had awarded the Polyot plant, which was based in Omsk, the right to produce the aircraft, ahead of Aviakor and Aviastar of Samara and Ulyanovsk, respectively. The Kiev Aircraft Production Plant was expected to produce the first aircraft in 2003, and Polyot, in 2004. As the An-70 flight test programme had reached its final stages {{by the end of}} 2000, it was expected that the Russian and Ukraine Defence Ministries would approve of mass production at the start of 2001. On 27 January 2001, however, the second An-70 prototype made a crash landing on its belly after losing power in two engines on take-off during cold weather testing in Omsk, and was severely damaged. Four of the 33 people onboard were injured. It looked <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> A400M was now going to have the market all to itself. Antonov recovered the crashed aircraft and repaired it, but the project still lacked funding.|$|E
5|$|In {{the trials}} {{match for the}} 1910 Five Nations Championship, Guillemin was {{selected}} {{to play for the}} Possibles against the Probables. The Probables won a close game 9–6, and Guillemin was selected again to play for France. The fourth match between England and France was held at Leicester on 30 January 1909. The English dominated from the start but the French put up a good fight, as both the English and French press reported. The French forwards were compared in their style of play with those of Ireland, with good footballing skills. Although the English won a fourth successive victory, 22–0, it seemed <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> French game was beginning to develop.|$|E
5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; it seemed <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time}} in my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E

5|$|The Nightfly debuted on Billboard Rock Albums chart {{at number}} 39 {{during the week}} ending October 23, 1982, peaking at number 25 on November 13. It debuted on the magazine's all-genre Top LPs and Tape chart on October 30 at number 45; it climbed to number 11, its peak, on November 27. It also charted on Billboard Black LPs chart, peaking at number 24. Internationally, the album charted higher: in Norway, it reached number seven on the charts. In Sweden and New Zealand, the album peaked at numbers eight and nine, respectively. The Nightfly {{performed}} poorer than Gaucho commercially; Fagen felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> label did not market the album properly or effectively. WBCN in Boston, inspired by the album cover, developed a promotion in which listeners could register to host their own radio show.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{songs that}} could be considered American popular music, as opposed to the popular music of a particular region or ethnicity, were sentimental parlor songs by Stephen Foster and his peers, and songs meant for use in minstrel shows, theatrical productions that featured singing, dancing and comic performances. Minstrel shows generally used African instruments and dance, and featured performers with their faces blackened, a technique called blackface. By the middle of the 19th century, touring companies had taken this music not only to every part of the United States, but also to the UK, Western Europe, and even to Africa and Asia. Minstrel shows were generally advertised <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> music of the shows was in an African American style, though this was often not true.|$|E
5|$|England captain Norman Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat despite the dull light; Trent Bridge had {{reputation}} for being favourable to batsmen, and in the previous Test between Australia and England at the ground in 1938, four Englishmen scored centuries as the hosts made 658, before Stan McCabe of Australia made 232 runs himself. The first innings set {{the pattern of the}} series as the English top order struggled against Australia's pace attack. Only twenty minutes of play was possible before lunch on the first day due to inclement weather, and the opening pair of Washbrook and Hutton {{had to deal with the}} contrasting bowling actions of Lindwall—with a low, somewhat round-arm action—and Miller, who extracted more bounce from a higher arm at the point of delivery. In the first two overs, the Australian pairing extracted little bounce and it seemed <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> hosts would be in a strong position to make a large score on a placid track if they made a solid start. Lindwall bowled the first ball of the match at a moderate pace, and Hutton pushed it square of the wicket on the off side for a single to start proceedings. Gradually, the Australian bowlers got into their rhythm and began to raise their pace. Miller induced an edge from Washbrook in his first over, but it bounced before reaching a fielder. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off the pitch to leave England at 9/1. The ball went between bat and pads as Hutton moved forward onto his front foot. The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the pitch of the ball, thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad.|$|E
