Despite being cautioned by Phineas's friends Baljeet and Isabella, Holyfield trains Phineas through simple tasks, including punching a chain of sausages and playing Dance Dance Revolution.|$|E
5|$|By the war's end in 1945, Bruce {{had become}} {{tired of the}} High Commission posting and hinted to Curtin's {{successor}} Ben Chifley {{that he would not}} object to being replaced in the position. In the last years of the war he had envisaged a post-war order based on a continuing alliance of the four powers the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and China that could evolve into a new international body with a similar function as the League of Nations, but with a stronger role and authority in international matters. Bruce had rejoined Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr in these years in reviving their proposals for international cooperation on nutrition and agriculture. He wrote and made representations at all levels on the subject, and became a leading voice once more advocating the creation of an international body to examine social and economic questions, much as he had done during his years with the League of Nations. The efforts of McDougall, Bruce and Orr finally paid off when their work {{came to the attention of}} Eleanor Roosevelt, and subsequently the American government, and their proposals would find expression <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> and Agriculture Conference that Franklin Roosevelt convened in Hot Springs, Virginia, in May 1943. This conference agreed to the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which became an associated institution with the United Nations when it was established formally in October 1945.|$|E
5|$|Meryl gets a {{voicemail}} from Sully, and Veronica {{agrees to}} track her. Veronica and Keith have another fight, with Veronica insulting his character {{for having a}} relationship with Harmony. Veronica and Meryl track the cell phone in the Fitzpatricks’ bar. Liam Fitzpatrick drunkenly picks up Veronica and carries her around, but Vinnie supposedly takes {{a picture of it}} to get him off her. Veronica and Meryl go to the police station and find that Sully washed up on shore after surfing with a bump on his head and had mild amnesia. While cleared, Mercer is still being held in custody. Keith rejects Harmony, and Logan nervously calls Keith for the whereabouts of Veronica. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> court, Veronica is listening to voicemails from Logan and Keith when she notices an issue with her food. She returns to the counter with her plate, leaving her drink unattended. She returns to her seat but, after eating and drinking, soon feels disoriented. She recognizes this feelings as identical to her experience after ingesting GHB previously. Veronica attempts to get into her car and collapses just outside of it but she manages to set off the alarm. A mysterious figure appears and stops the alarm. There is a buzzing sound the scene cuts to a nearby Logan hearing the alarm. Logan finds Veronica's car with her unconscious on the ground next to it. He picks her up to reveal some locks of Veronica's hair on the ground and a bald spot {{on the back of her}} head.|$|E

25|$|Emulsifying agent (lecithin) used in {{mayonnaise}} {{are able}} to suspend oil droplets in water because it lowers the interfacial tension γ between oil and water. When emulsifying agent, lecithin, {{is added to the}} oil and water emulsion, they form a layer between the two different liquids, with their hydrophobic tail point toward the non-polar oil droplet, and their hydrophilic end facing the polar water molecules. This reduces the interfacial tension γ because the water molecules are no longer in contact with hydrocarbon molecules. Hence, a large increase of surface area (ΔA) is made possible because energy cost to arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> state is now favorable.|$|E

25|$|Food {{stability}} {{refers to}} the ability to obtain food over time. Food insecurity can be transitory, seasonal, or chronic. In transitory food insecurity, food may be unavailable during certain periods of time. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> production level, natural disasters and drought result in crop failure and decreased food availability. Civil conflicts can also decrease access to food. Instability in markets resulting in food-price spikes can cause transitory food insecurity. Other factors that can temporarily cause food insecurity are loss of employment or productivity, which can be caused by illness. Seasonal food insecurity can result from the regular pattern of growing seasons in food production.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} quarter of the 12th, Herman I from the Ludowinger dynasty founded the town of Freyburg. The town was built <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> of Neuenburg Castle around a {{rectangular}} market place to meet the demands of the increased population, to provide the Neuenburg Castle with merchandise and to secure the passage and revenues of the Unstrut River. The landgraves of Thuringia controlled the road in the valley by erecting this fortified town. The determinative ″frey″ (free) referred to the royal freedom granted to it when it was founded and to the baronial privilege of a nearly royal rank, which primarily reveals the self-image of its rulers. The unity of Neuenburg castle and the town of Freyburg is a typical feature of the policy of power of the Ludowingers.|$|E
25|$|For {{the rest}} of the season, Nadeau was hired by Petty Enterprises to drive Steve Grissom's No. 44 Dodge car, {{although}} he injured his ribs and shoulder in an go-kart accident at his home before the Old Dominion 500.

25|$|Lloyd George wanted Russia {{persuaded to}} make the maximum {{possible}} effort, a necessity again stressed at the second Chantilly Conference in December 1916. Wilson was sent as Senior Military Representative (Robertson had refused to go) on a British mission to Russia in January 1917 (delayed from November 1916), the object of which {{was to keep the}} Russians holding down at least the forces now opposite them, to boost Russian morale and see what equipment they needed with a view to coordinating attacks. The party of 50 included British (led by Milner and including a banker and two munitions experts), French (led by de Castelnau) and Italian delegations. The War Office briefing advised that Russia was close to revolution. Wilson met the Tsar but thought him “as devoid of character & purpose as our own poor miserable King”. Even senior Russian officials were talking openly of assassinating the Tsar or perhaps just the Tsarina. Wilson was impressed by Generals Ruzski and Danilov, although he may have been influenced too much by the views of Knox, who had been British military attaché since 1911. He toured Petrograd, Moscow (where he was concerned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> shortages) and Riga, which he predicted the “Boches” would never capture (they would do so in late 1917), and thought that even if Tsar and Tsarina were assassinated – the Tsar was toppled a few weeks after he left – Russia would not make a separate peace. His official report (3 March) said that Russia would remain in the war and that they would solve their “administrative chaos”. However, many other observers at the time, e.g. the young Archibald Wavell in the Caucasus, felt that the advent of democracy in Russia would reinvigorate her war effort, so Wilson’s views were not entirely unusual.|$|E
500|$|One man and {{one woman}} are chosen for each year the Queen has lived (including the year she is {{currently}} living), and they receive Maundy money equivalent in pence to that number of years.

[...] The cathedral is designated the Royal Chapel for the day of the service, and the Royal Standard flies.

[...] The origin of this custom is uncertain but apparently dates from the times when provisions were distributed to the poor; some experts believe the dishes were carried high to stop the poor from grabbing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> prematurely; others believe that the position was to prevent the congregation from being overwhelmed by the smell of fish.|$|E
500|$|Kulwicki passed Dale Jarrett with 27laps left <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> City 500 race on April 5 at Bristol to take {{a narrow}} victory. It was his fourthWinston Cup victory. After that race, he never left the topfive in season points. Andrews {{attributed}} Kulwicki's consistently strong finishes to the steady performance of newly adopted radial tires throughout their lifespan. He said, [...] "It was hard to control them, and the driver's ability to work with that car during practice {{in order to get}} the car set up meant so much more than it ever did." [...] Kulwicki's second victory in the season was at the first race at Pocono. Discounted as a contender for the season championship during the year, Kulwicki was expected to fade from contention. He qualified on the pole position for the Peak AntiFreeze 500 race on September 20 at Dover, but crashed early in the race and finished 34th.|$|E
