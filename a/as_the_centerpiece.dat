5|$|For years {{leading up}} to the {{creation}} of the park, the leading citizens and newspapers in Albany had pushed for a grand public park. Frederick Law Olmsted's Olmsted, Vaux and Company was hired in 1869 to plan such a park. In their plan they envisioned Washington Park <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerpiece</b> of a string of parks and boulevards similar to those they had designed in Buffalo, Boston, and Brooklyn. Though Olmsted and his company was not involved in the actual design of the park, their broad vision was followed for the detailed designs, including the idea of damming the Beaver Kill (Beaver Creek) to form a grand lake.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Missouri was {{outfitted}} with 40mm grenade launchers and 25mm chain guns {{and sent to}} take part in Operation Earnest Will, the escorting of reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. These smaller-caliber weapons were installed due to the threat of Iranian-manned, Swedish-made Boghammar cigarette boats operating in the Persian Gulf at the time. On 25 July, the ship departed on a six-month deployment to the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea. She spent more than 100 continuous days at sea in a hot, tense environment– a striking contrast to her world cruise months earlier. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerpiece</b> for Battlegroup Echo, Missouri escorted tanker convoys through the Strait of Hormuz, keeping her fire control system trained on land-based Iranian Silkworm missile launchers.|$|E
5|$|In 449 BC, the Senate promulgated the Twelve Tables <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerpiece</b> of the Roman Constitution. In 443 BC, {{the office}} of Censor was created, and in 367 BC, Plebeians were allowed to stand for the Consulship. The opening of the Consulship to the Plebeian class implicitly opened both the Censorship {{as well as the}} Dictatorship to Plebeians. In 366 BC, in an effort by the Patricians to reassert their {{influence}} over the magisterial offices, two new offices were created. While these two offices, the Praetorship and the Curule Aedileship, were at first open only to Patricians, within a generation, they were open to Plebeians as well.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 2005–06 season, Bosh {{was named}} {{as one of}} Toronto's team captains. Bosh {{continued}} {{to work on his}} game as he consistently chalked up double doubles, leading the team in scoring, rebounding, and field goal percentage {{for the first half of}} the season. On February 9, 2006, for the first time in his career, Bosh was selected to play in the 2006 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, Texas as a reserve forward for the Eastern Conference. He was only the third Raptor to make an All-Star game, after Carter and Antonio Davis. Bosh's selection was just three days after he was named NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the second time in his career. In March 2006, following a season-ending injury to Bosh, the Raptors hit a 1–10 skid. This highlighted Bosh's importance <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerpiece</b> of the offense, as well as the leader of the team. The Raptors finished the season 27–55 and Bosh averaged 22.5 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1800s to the 1910s {{a period of}} {{nationalism}} and interest in Nordic symbols resulted in the Art Nouveau variant National romanticism which is well represented in Aarhus.
