40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to {{understanding}} the effect of inter-particle interactions, external fields and confinement in <b>active</b> <b>suspensions.</b> <b>Active</b> <b>suspensions,</b> such as a bath of swimming micro-organisms, have microstructural elements which are motile and exert active stresses on the suspending fluid. The internally generated stresses in <b>active</b> <b>suspensions</b> lead to an intrinsic coupling between the swimmer configurations and the immersing fluid. The first theme of the thesis focuses on hydrodynamically driven self-organization in <b>active</b> <b>suspensions.</b> We first study the dynamics of concentrated <b>active</b> <b>suspensions</b> in a 3 D periodic domain using a coupled Smoluchowski-Stokes kinetic model and discover novel instabilities for both rear-actuated (pusher) and front-actuated (puller) swimmers, characterized by giant number density fluctuations, due to the coupled effects of hydrodynamic and steric interactions. Next, we incorporate chemotactic run-and-tumble effects in the kinetic model to study the dynamics in thin films of aerotactic bacteria. A transition to chaotic dynamics beyond a critical film thickness is reported, in agreement with experiments, and {{shown to be a}} consequence of the coupling between aerotactic response of bacteria and hydrodynamic disturbance flows. The second theme focuses on the sole interplay between motility and confinement in dilute suspensions, ignoring the effect of inter-particle interactions. First, we investigate the dynamics of a confined suspension of Brownian swimmers using a simple kinetic model by prescribing a no-flux condition on the probability distribution function of particle configurations and explain several peculiar dynamics reported in experiments, viz., wall accumulation, as well as upstream swimming, centerline depletion and shear-trapping when a pressure-driven flow is imposed. Next, we calculate the swim pressure of non-Brownian run-and-tumble spherical swimmers using a kinetic model based on coupled bulk/surface probability density functions. The third theme focuses on the effect of confinement on active self-organization. We discover a symmetry-breaking phase-transition to a spontaneous flowing state with net fluid pumping beyond a critical concentration in a strongly confined channel. The framework for studying confined <b>active</b> <b>suspensions</b> is also extended to explore geometric control of active self-organization in circular and other complex domains...|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{suppression}} {{is considered}} as a keyresearch field in civil engineering {{to ensure the safety}} and comfort of their occupants and users of mechanical structures. To reduce the system vibration, an effective vibration control with isolation is necessary. Vibration control techniques have classically been categorized into two areas, passive and active controls. For a long time, efforts were made to make the suspension system work optimally by optimizing its parameters, but due to the intrinsic limitations of a passive suspension system, improvements were effective only in a certain frequency range. Compared with passive <b>suspensions,</b> <b>active</b> <b>suspensions</b> can improve the performance of the suspension system over a wide range of frequencies. Semi-active suspensions were proposed in the early 1970 s [1], and can be nearly as effective as <b>active</b> <b>suspensions.</b> When the control system fails, the semi-active suspension can still work under passive conditions. Compared with <b>active</b> and passive <b>suspension</b> systems, the semi-active suspension system combines the advantages of both <b>active</b> and passive <b>suspensions</b> because it provides better performance when compared with passive suspensions and is economical, safe and does not require either higher-power actuators or a large power supply as <b>active</b> <b>suspensions</b> do [2]. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Biologically <b>active</b> <b>{{suspensions}},</b> such as suspensions {{of swimming}} mi-croorganisms, exhibit fascinating dynamics including large-scale collective motions and pattern formation, complex chaotic flows with good mixing properties, enhanced pass-sive tracer diffusion, among others. There {{has been much}} recent interest in modeling and understanding these effects, which often result from long-ranged fluid-mediated in-teractions between swimming particles. This paper provides a general introduction {{to a number of}} recent investigations on these systems based on a continuum mean-field description of hydrodynamic interactions.

The geometric aspects of the vehicle dynamics are emphasized and it is shown that disturbance localization is a structural property of vehicles with <b>active</b> <b>suspensions.</b> On the implementation side, we show that, if suspensions heights along with their derivatives are available as measured outputs, disturbance localization can be gained by a static output feedbac...|$|R
25|$|The Williams FW15C was an {{extremely}} dominant car, with <b>active</b> <b>suspension</b> and traction control systems beyond anything available to the other teams. Prost won on his debut for the team in South Africa and, like Mansell, dominated the weekend, taking pole position and finishing a minute ahead of Senna, who was second. The next Grand Prix in Brazil saw Prost collide with Christian Fittipaldi's Minardi in the rain on lap 29, while Hill went on to his first podium finish: second, 16 seconds behind Senna. Prost won three of the next four Grands Prix for Williams, Senna winning the other race. Prost and Hill later scored a 1–2 in France: the only 1–2 of the season for Williams. Prost won the next two Grands Prix at Silverstone and Hockenheim. Hill proved competitive especially {{in the second half}} of the season. Mechanical problems cost Hill leads in Britain and Germany, but he went on to win the next three Grands Prix at Hungary, Belgium and Italy which moved him to second in the standings, as well as giving him a chance of taking the Drivers' title. After Italy, Williams would not win a Grand Prix for the rest of the season, as a young Michael Schumacher won the following race in Portugal, and Senna took Japan and Australia to overtake Hill in the points. Williams retained their constructors' title, 84 points ahead of second-placed McLaren. Prost clinched the Drivers' Championship in Portugal and finished the season 26 points ahead of second-placed Senna.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Senna's {{determination}} to win {{manifested itself in}} dismay at McLaren's inability to challenge Williams's all-conquering FW14B car. McLaren's new car for the season had several shortcomings. A delay occurred in getting the new model running (it debuted in the third race of the season, the Brazilian Grand Prix) {{and in addition to}} lacking <b>active</b> <b>suspension,</b> the new car suffered from reliability issues and was unpredictable in fast corners, while its Honda V12 engine was no longer the most powerful on the circuit. During practice for the second race of the season in Mexico on a circuit Senna was heavily critical of, his car hit a bump that caused a loss of downforce and hard crash into a concrete retaining wall. He had to be extricated from the car by circuit doctors; although he raced the next day, albeit retiring from the race due to gearbox failure. Senna scored wins in Monaco, Hungary, and Italy that year. During qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix, French driver Érik Comas crashed heavily and Senna was the first to arrive at the scene. He got out of his car and ran across the track to help the Frenchman, disregarding his own safety in an effort to aid a fellow driver. He later went to visit Comas in the hospital. His actions won universal praise from those in Formula One and seemed to soften his hard-nosed image. Senna finished fourth overall in the championship, behind the Williams duo of Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, and Benetton's Michael Schumacher.|$|E
25|$|Team Lotus had a {{new engine}} deal in 1987, running the same {{turbocharged}} Honda V6 engines as Williams had used to win the previous year's Constructors' Championship, and with them came a new teammate, 34-year-old Japanese driver, Satoru Nakajima. The team guaranteed Senna contractually preferential treatment over Nakajima in the allocation of equipment. Senna started the season with mixed fortunes: a podium at the San Marino Grand Prix was tempered by controversy at the following race at Spa-Francorchamps, where he collided with Mansell, and afterward in the pits an angered Englishman grabbed Senna by the throat {{and had to be}} restrained by Lotus mechanics. Senna then won two races in a row, which helped him take the lead in the World Championship: the ensuing Monaco Grand Prix (the first of his record six victories at the Principality) and the Detroit Grand Prix, his second victory in two years at the Michigan street circuit and the first ever for an <b>active</b> <b>suspension</b> F1 car. As the championship wore on however, it became evident that the Williams cars had the advantage over the rest of the field, the gap between the Honda-engined teams made most obvious at the British Grand Prix, where Mansell and Piquet lapped the Lotuses of Senna and Nakajima who finished 3rd and 4th respectively. Senna became dissatisfied with his chances at Lotus and at Monza it was announced that he would be joining McLaren for 1988. Senna finished the season strongly, coming second in the final two races in Japan and Australia, however post-race scrutineering at the final race found the brake ducts of his Lotus to be wider than permitted by the rules and he was disqualified, bringing his last and most successful season with Lotus to a sour end. Senna was classified third in the final standings, with 57 points, with six podium finishes and only one pole position. This season marked a turning point in Senna's career as, throughout the year, he built a deep relationship with Honda, one which would pay big dividends, as McLaren had secured Williams's supply of Honda's V6 turbo engines for 1988.|$|E
40|$|The {{geometric}} control {{properties of}} vehicles with <b>active</b> <b>suspensions</b> are analyzed. A special attention {{is devoted to}} the problem of disturbance decoupling. <b>Active</b> <b>suspensions</b> of advanced vehicles allow the active rejection of external disturbances exerted on the sprung mass of the vehicle and caused by road surface irregularity. We focus on the road irregularity disturbances with the purpose of isolating the chassis from vibrations transmitted through suspensions.

The paper emphasizes that disturbance decoupling can be thought as a structural property of road vehicles with <b>active</b> <b>suspensions.</b> The framework throughout is the geometric approach to the control of dynamic systems. It is shown that a controlled and conditioned invariant subspace exists such that it allows the geometric disturbance localization.

40|$|A simple {{model for}} {{simulating}} flows of <b>active</b> <b>suspensions</b> is investigated. The approach {{is based on}} dissipative particle dynamics. While the model is potentially applicable {{to a wide range}} of self-propelled particle systems, the specific class of self-motile bacterial suspensions is considered as a modeling scenario. To mimic the rod-like geometry of a bacterium, two dissipative particle dynamics particles are connected by a stiff harmonic spring to form an aggregate dissipative particle dynamics molecule. Bacterial motility is modeled through a constant self-propulsion force applied along the axis of each such aggregate molecule. The model accounts for hydrodynamic interactions between self-propelled agents through the pairwise dissipative interactions conventional to dissipative particle dynamics. Numerical simulations are performed using a customized version of the open-source LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) software package. Detailed studies of the influence of agent concentration, pairwise dissipative interactions, and Stokes friction on the statistics of the system are provided. The simulations are used to explore the influence of hydrodynamic interactions in <b>active</b> <b>suspensions.</b> For high agent concentrations in combination with dominating pairwise dissipative forces, strongly correlated motion patterns and a fluid-like spectral distributions of kinetic energy are found. In contrast, systems dominated by Stokes friction exhibit weaker spatial correlations of the velocity field.

40|$|Increasing {{a railway}} vehicle's speed on {{existing}} track, its dynamic performances are negatively affected. To {{compensate for the}} deteriorated dynamic behaviour, a re-design of the suspension system {{has been carried out}} in the years. For trains which are operated at very high speed in combination with high cant deficiency, a purely passive solution is not always sufficient. Thus, an active solution offering better possibilities of improving the vehicle’s dynamic performances are sought for. <b>Active</b> <b>suspensions</b> in trains have been studied for a number of years. Two general categories can be identified: one improving running stability and wheelset guidance and another improving passenger ride comfort. However, due to relatively high implementation and maintenance costs, only few applications are being used in service operation. One of these <b>active</b> <b>suspensions</b> has recently been tested on V 300 Zefiro train, the new Italian high speed train. In fact, V 300 Zefiro is being homologated up to a speed of 350 km/h with a high cant deficiency. The main target of <b>active</b> lateral <b>suspensions</b> on V 300 Zefiro train is to improve passenger ride comfort. In a conventional bogie, the carbody’s inertia forces in curves are transferred through the suspension and eventually through the bumpstops to the bogie frame. With an <b>active</b> lateral <b>suspension,</b> these inertia forces are transferred to the bogie frame through the lateral actuators in order to avoid bumpstop contact, and finally to the wheelsets resulting in a change in wheel-rail contact forces. This force transfer, together with the passenger comfort, should carefully be addressed in order to evaluate all consequences of the developed control logic with respect to the track. The present paper focuses on the dynamic characterization of the <b>active</b> lateral <b>suspensions</b> (with particular focus on V 300 Zefiro) based on the measurement of displacement and transmitted force in real working conditions, {{as well as on the}} influence of the <b>active</b> lateral <b>suspensions</b> on the centring capabilities of the carbody with respect to the bogie and on the resulting wheel-rail contact force components (being the instrumented <b>active</b> lateral <b>suspensions</b> mounted on bogies having load measurement wheelsets) ...|$|R
