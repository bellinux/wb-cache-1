50|$|Frangible nuts {{were also}} used for {{separation}} of the two aft structural attachments of the external tank prior to orbital insertion. The <b>attach</b> <b>bolts</b> were driven by the explosive force of the NSDs and a spring into a cavity in the tank strut. The nuts and all residual pieces of the NSDs were caught in a cover assembly within the shuttle.|$|R
50|$|Friction torque {{can also}} be an asset in engineering. Bolts and nuts, or screws are often {{designed}} to be fastened with a given amount of torque, where the friction is adequate during use or operation for the bolt, nut or screw to remain safely fastened. This is true with such applications as lug nuts retaining wheels to vehicles, or equipment subjected to vibration with sufficiently well <b>attached</b> <b>bolts,</b> nuts or screws to prevent the vibration from shaking them loose.|$|R
50|$|Reardon {{was known}} for leaving mementos for those who {{followed}} him. Examples include plastic tigers <b>attached</b> to <b>bolts</b> and oversized panties in summit registers.|$|R
50|$|The main {{structural}} TETRIX MAX {{pieces are}} aluminum channel with a trademarked hole pattern that enables connections at multiples of 45°. The pieces are <b>attached</b> using <b>bolts.</b> Other building elements include gears, wheels, motors and servos.|$|R
50|$|It is {{frequently}} used in climbing and caving as an easily untie-able knot that {{is capable of}} being <b>attached</b> to two <b>bolts</b> and equalised.|$|R
40|$|Feeder attachment, which fits on a {{standard}} power driver, drives a series of longitudinally <b>attached</b> torque <b>bolts</b> into place with great speed. It allows loading {{of a series of}} bolts and then positions individual bolts in the driving head for assembly. The attachment contains a socket gun which may be modified to accommodate different types and sizes of bolts...|$|R

5000|$|Orange Curves {{consists}} of three cast steel curves welded together. When looking at the proper front of the sculpture the middle curve {{appears to be the}} link between the bottom and top curves. This middle curve resembles a backward [...] "c" [...] with the top curve looped through the top of the inverted [...] "c" [...] and the bottom curved looped through the bottom middle portion of the same middle curve. Both the bottom and the middle curves are attached to the base with additional pieces of steel which have been bolted into the concrete base. The composition does not appear to suggest anything representational. Each curve is similar in size in shape but are not identical. The entire sculpture, except the <b>attaching</b> <b>bolts,</b> has been painted orange. An image on the artist's website indicates that this sculpture was exhibited inside in another context sometime before it was installed in its present location.|$|R
2500|$|The {{resulting}} pressure {{inside the}} compartment popped the <b>bolts</b> <b>attaching</b> the [...] Sector 4 outer aluminum skin panel, which as it blew off probably caused minor {{damage to the}} nearby S-band antenna.|$|R
40|$|The current {{design of}} the ARES 1 Upper Stage uses a common {{bulkhead}} to separate the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks. The bulkhead consists of aluminum face sheets bonded to a Phenolic honeycomb core. The face sheets, or domes, are friction stir welded to Y-rings that connect the bulkhead to the barrel sections of the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks. Load between the Y-rings is carried by an externally <b>attached</b> <b>bolting</b> ring. The development of nondestructive evaluation methods for the ARES I Upper Stage Common Bulkhead are outlined in this presentation. Methods for inspecting the various components of the bulkhead are covered focusing in on the dome skins, core-to-dome bond lines and friction stir welds as well as structural details like the fastener holes. Thermography, shearography and ultrasonic methods are discussed for the bond lines. Eddy current methods are discussed for the fastener holes and dome skins. A combination of phased array ultrasound, liquid penetrant and radiography are to being investigated for use on the friction stir welds. Keywords: Composite materials, NDE, Cryogenic structure...|$|R
50|$|The BMW R nineT {{has several}} design {{elements}} configured {{to allow the}} bike to be easily modified, such as separate engine and chassis wiring harnesses and minimal <b>bolts</b> <b>attaching</b> the rear subframe, tail lights, and headlight.|$|R
5000|$|The {{plates are}} {{installed}} {{on both the}} front and rear of the vehicle, with the rear plate permanently attached to the vehicle with a prefecture seal completely covering one of the <b>attaching</b> plate <b>bolts.</b> The plate is only removed when the vehicle has reached the end of service and has been sold for scrap, or exported. New vehicles are not delivered to the purchaser until the plates have been attached at the dealership.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{difference}} between rear axle/rear ends on all-wheel-drive models. 1990-early 1992 cars have three <b>bolts</b> <b>attaching</b> the axle to the wheel hub. Late 1992-1994 have larger-diameter axles and attach to the hub with bigger, 4-bolt axle cups.|$|R
50|$|On power cars, spoked wheels with {{separate}} steel tires are used; the tires have an outer diameter of 105 cm (1050 mm) and a thickness of 75 mm. The tires are shrunk onto the wheels, {{which are in}} turn shrunk onto the axle. One of the wheels on each axle has an elongated hub, which is <b>attached</b> with <b>bolts</b> to the large spur gear. The wheels of the trailer cars are smaller in size (only 95 cm in diameter), solid, have shorter hubs and a thinner axle.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from Oct. 5, 2012 - Oct. 5, 2014 A lightweight carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) c-channel beam was previously designed using analytical theory and finite element analysis and subsequently manufactured through a pultrusion process. Physical testing revealed the prototype {{did not meet the}} bending and torsional stiffness of the beam model. An investigation revealed that the manufactured prototype had lower fiber content than designed, compacted geometry, an altered ply layup, missing plies, and ply folds. Incorporating these changes into the beam model significantly improved model-experiment agreement. Using what was learned from the initial prototype, several new beam designs were modeled that compare the cost per weight-savings of different composite materials. The results of these models show that fiberglass is not a viable alternative to CFRP when designing for equivalent stiffness. Standard modulus carbon was shown to have slightly lower cost per-weight savings than intermediate modulus carbon, although intermediate modulus carbon saves more weight overall. Core materials, despite potential weight savings, were ruled out as {{they do not have the}} crush resistance to handle the likely clamp loads of any <b>attaching</b> <b>bolts.</b> Despite determining the ideal materials, the manufactured cost per weight-savings of the best CFRP beam design was about double the desired target...|$|R
50|$|After {{rear end}} testing by Copp's team proved {{there was a}} problem from the <b>bolts</b> <b>attaching</b> the rear bumper to the body, and those {{protruding}} from the differential, would in an accident above 20 mph penetrate the gas tank, Copp issued an internal memo suggesting rectification measures.|$|R
50|$|Amongst {{its list}} of {{improvements}} is increased case rigidity and {{twice the number of}} <b>bolts</b> <b>attaching</b> it to the engine (eight instead of four). The syncromesh baulk ring, gear docking teeth angles and the double cone syncro on 2nd and 3rd gear have also all been retuned.|$|R
50|$|The winding knob is on {{the side}} of the spool. Most reels are laid out for holding in the left hand and winding with the right. The knob is usually <b>attached</b> by a <b>bolt</b> which allows it to rotate, giving a more secure grip to the winding hand.|$|R
50|$|The TKB-09 (ТКБ-09) was a Soviet delayed {{blowback}} {{assault rifle}} chambered in 5.45×39mm. It used a <b>bolt</b> <b>attached</b> to a spring in a tube above the barrel. The TKB-09 {{was intended to}} force the weight forward as means of increasing accuracy. TKB-010 was the variant chambered in 7.62×39mm.|$|R
60|$|He discovered, later, {{traces of}} an attempt to cross the gap in the broken bridge. A rope with a <b>bolt</b> <b>attached</b> had been flung across and had caught in a {{fenestration}} of a projecting fragment of railing. The end of the rope trailed in the seething water towards the fall.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} verification of a system used to attach two segments of the International Space Station (ISS). This system was first used in space to mate the P 6 and Z 1 trusses together in December 2000, {{through a combination of}} robotic and extravehicular tasks. Features that provided capture, coarse alignment, and fine alignment during the berthing process are described. Attachment of this high value hardware was critical to the ISS's sequential assembly, necessitating the inclusion of backup design and operational features. Astronauts checked for the proper performance of the alignment and bolting features during on-orbit operations. During berthing, the system accommodates truss-to-truss relative displacements that are caused by manufacturing tolerances and on-orbit thermal gradients. After bolt installation, the truss interface becomes statically determinate with respect to in-plane shear loads and isolates <b>attach</b> <b>bolts</b> from bending moments. The approach used to estimate relative displacements and the means of accommodating them is explained. Confidence in system performance was achieved through a cost-effective collection of tests and analyses, including thermal, structural, vibration, misalignment, contact dynamics, underwater simulation, and full-scale functional testing. Design considerations that have potential application to other mechanisms include accommodating variations of friction coefficients in the on-orbit joints, wrench torque tolerances, joint preload, moving element clearances at temperature extremes, and bolt-nut torque reaction...|$|R
5000|$|... "H": {{introduced}} in 1937 {{in which the}} float bowl has an arm cast into its base, which mounts {{to the bottom of}} the carburetor with a hollow bolt or banjo fitting. Fuel passes through the arm into the carburetor body. The <b>bolt</b> <b>attaches</b> to the carburetor body just behind the main jet assembly.|$|R
50|$|The bonnet {{provides}} a leakproof closure for the valve body. The threaded {{section of the}} stem goes through a hole with matching threads in the bonnet. Globe valves may have a screw-in, union, or bolted bonnet. Screw-in bonnet is the simplest bonnet, offering a durable, pressure-tight seal. Union bonnet is suitable for applications requiring frequent inspection or cleaning. It also gives the body added strength. A bonnet <b>attached</b> with <b>bolts</b> is used for larger or higher pressure applications. The bonnet also contains the packing, a wearable material that maintains the seal between the bonnet and the stem during valve cycling.|$|R
50|$|Unlike many rifles {{designed}} later, {{the bolt}} {{head of this}} rifle is able {{to be removed from}} the bolt body. This piece could be removed during disassembly, and was frequently lost. Additionally, both the ejector and the extractor that are <b>attached</b> to the <b>bolt</b> head are prone to falling out if care is not taken during disassembly and reassembly.|$|R
50|$|A {{test flight}} of the new {{aircraft}} ends in disaster; the wings are ripped off during a high-speed dive, and the test pilot is killed. It is found that <b>bolts</b> <b>attaching</b> the wings were cut. Later, Carter finds Keller's body in a running car in a closed garage. Carter suspects Keller was strangled, and the scene staged {{to look like a}} suicide.|$|R
50|$|A 4-bolt main {{refers to}} the number of <b>bolts</b> <b>attaching</b> the main bearing caps to the block of an {{internal}} combustion engine. Four bolt mains are considered much stronger for high performance use than a 2 bolt main. Using 4 bolts to secure the main bearing caps reduces the amount of flex within the crankshaft as compared to 2 bolts.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{specialized}} sockets {{are made}} with a specialized [...] "6 flute" [...] etc. socket that <b>attaches</b> to damaged <b>bolts</b> of both metric and fractional inch sizes for removal. Some specialized sockets are made to fit specific specialized applications and are designed and sized for that specific application. Spark plug sockets, oxygen sensor sockets, ball joint sockets, axle nut sockets, etc. fit in this category.|$|R
50|$|A 40.2 metre (132 foot) high timber {{tower was}} {{originally}} located alongside each igloo. Only {{the base of}} the northern tower was observed. Because of conditions at the time of survey, no evidence of {{the base of the}} southern tower could be seen. The tower footings comprise four 1 metre square concrete foundations, each containing two steel members about 1.5 metres in height to which the timber base of the tower was <b>attached</b> with <b>bolts.</b> No timber-work survives. The surviving steelwork is severely corroded. A shallow circular concrete pit about 2 metres in diameter, is located under the centre of the tower. The base of the tower occupies an area of about 12 metres square.|$|R
50|$|The bitumen sealed east-west Runway 60 degrees extends {{east of the}} Gregory Developmental Road {{for about}} two {{kilometres}} in length. The unfinished north-south Runway 20 degrees, remains evident as a regrowth area and former wartime taxiway running parallel with the road. Other taxiways extend north and west from Runway 60 to workshop sites of the Airframe Repair Section, General Engineering Section and Engine Repair Section. The duty pilot's tower {{is located at the}} western end of Runway 60. The site comprises a concrete slab, possibly an office floor, with four concrete tower footings at each corner, each containing two steel members to which the base of the tower was <b>attached</b> with <b>bolts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The CZ 550 system {{consists}} of a receiver {{that serves as the}} systems shroud and a bolt group of which the bolt body has three locking lugs, two large main lugs at the bolt head and the bolt handle serves as a backup in case the primary locking lugs failed. The bolt handle is permanently <b>attached</b> to the <b>bolt</b> and is turned-down and backwards for use with optical sights.|$|R
5000|$|Otto Wagner, in Vienna, {{was another}} pioneer {{of the new}} style. In his book Moderne Architektur (1895) he had called for a more rationalist style of architecture, based on [...] "modern life". He {{designed}} a stylized ornamental metro station at Karlsplatz in Vienna (1888-89), then an ornamental Art Nouveau residence, Majolika House (1898), before moving to a much more geometric and simplified style, without ornament, in the Austrian Postal Savings Bank (1904-1906). Wagner declared his intention to express {{the function of the}} building in its exterior. The reinforced concrete exterior was covered with plaques of marble <b>attached</b> with <b>bolts</b> of polished aluminum. The interior was purely functional and spare, a large open space of steel, glass and concrete where the only decoration was the structure itself[...]|$|R
50|$|The rifle shared many {{features}} {{with the}} Arisaka rifle, {{such as a}} two-part stock, a ovoid bolt handle, and double-gas escape ports on the receiver. It also had a sliding <b>bolt</b> cover that <b>attached</b> to the <b>bolt,</b> and was removable. Another similarity it had with the Arisaka was the bolt being bored from the rear, {{in order to allow}} room for a mainspring, which was fixed in by the use of a large housing.|$|R
