40|$|Background: Two {{case reports}} of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and one case-report of PMR and temporalis {{arteritis}} (AT) {{suggest that the}} use of statins may have triggered the development of these inflammatory rheumatic diseases. PMR is closely linked to the disease <b>arteritis</b> <b>temporalis</b> which makes it difficult for physicians to distinguish these two diseases. Data on the association between the use of statins and PMR and/or AT are scarce. Objectives: To assess the association between statin use and the occurrence of PMR/AT. Methods: A case/non-case study based on individual case safety reports (ICSR) listed in the World Health Organisation (WHO) global ICSR database (Vigibase) was conducted. According to WHO adverse reaction terminology, cases were defined as reports of PMR. Each case was matched with five non-cases by age, gender and time of reporting. Non-cases were all other ADR-reports. Use of statins was classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification code system (C 10 AA, C 10 BA, C 10 BX). Potential confounders in the analysis, i. e., use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidepressants, anti-epileptics, proton pump inhibitors and cardiovascular drugs were determined. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate the reporting odds ratios (RORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). In addition, three case-reports from the VigiBase were studied in detail. Results: We identified 327 reports of PMR/AT as cases and 1635 reports of other ADRs as non-cases. Among cases statins were more frequently reported as suspected agent (29. 4 %) compared to non-cases (2. 9 %). After adjustment for several covariates, statins were statistically significantly associated with reports of PMR/AT (ROR 14. 21; 95 % CI 9. 89 - 20. 85). Conclusions: The result of this study underlines findings of the case reports {{that the use of}} statins may be associated with the occurrence of PMR/AT...|$|E
