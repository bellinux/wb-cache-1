50|$|In mathematics, the X-ray {{transform}} (also called John transform) is {{an integral}} transform introduced by Fritz John in 1938 {{that is one of}} the cornerstones of modern integral geometry. It is very closely related to the Radon transform, and coincides with it in two dimensions. In higher dimensions, the X-ray transform of a function is defined by integrating over lines rather than over hyperplanes as in the Radon transform. The X-ray transform derives its name from X-ray tomography because the X-ray transform of a function &fnof; represents the <b>attenuation</b> <b>data</b> of a tomographic scan through an inhomogeneous medium whose density is represented by the function &fnof;. Inversion of the X-ray transform is therefore of practical importance because it allows one to reconstruct an unknown density &fnof; from its known <b>attenuation</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E

Frequency-dependent seismic velocity and <b>attenuation</b> anisotropy <b>data</b> contain information about the fractures present in the reservoir. In this study, we use the measurements of velocity and <b>attenuation</b> anisotropy <b>data</b> corresponding to different seismic frequencies and azimuths to infer information about the multiple fracture sets present in the reservoir. We consider a reservoir model with two sets of vertical fractures characterized by unknown azimuthal fracture orientations and fracture densities.

50|$|Surface {{acoustic}} wave devices {{consists of a}} piezoelectric crystal-like lithium niobate on which transducers are made by single-metal-layer photolithographic technology. The transducers usually are Inter-Digital Transducers (IDT), which have a two-toothed comb-like structure. An antenna {{is attached to the}} IDT for reception and transmission. The transducers convert the incident radio wave to surface {{acoustic wave}}s that travel on the crystal surface until it reaches the encoding reflectors that reflect some waves and transmit the rest. The IDT collects the reflected waves and transmits them to the reader. The first and last reflectors are used for calibration as the response may be affected by physical parameters such as temperature. A pair of reflectors may also be used for error correction. The reflections increase in size from nearest to farthest of the IDT to account for losses due to preceding reflectors and wave <b>attenuation.</b> <b>Data</b> is encoded using Pulse Position Modulation (PPM). The crystal is logically divided into groups, such that each group typically has a length equal to the inverse of the bandwidth. Each group is divided into slots of equal width. The reflector may be placed in any slot. The last slot in each group is usually unused, leaving n-1 positions for the reflector, thus encoding n-1 states. The repetition rate of the PPM is equal to the system bandwidth. The reflector's slot position may be used to encode phase. The devices' temperature dependence means they can also act as temperature sensors.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a model for}} nonlinear acoustic wave propagation through absorbing and weakly dispersive media, and its numerical solution by means of finite differences in time domain method (FDTD).
