The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid, hence the name succinite. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather {{greater than that of}} many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10.

40|$|Soil {{samples from}} the A horizon of an Eutrochrept under spruce forest and {{permanent}} grass were fractionated into clay-, silt- and sand-size separates. Humic acids extracted from each fraction were analysed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Protection of functional groups by simultaneous pyrolysis and methylation yielded pyrolysates in which methyl esters of fatty acids, aliphatic dicarboxylic <b>acids,</b> <b>abietic</b> <b>acids,</b> phenolic acids and benzenecarboxylic acids were represented. However, methylation was not complete, and unmethylated compounds were also present. Spectra showed differences in humic acid composition between size separates as well as across land use regimes. The abundance of lignin-derived pyrolysis products increased with decreasing particle size, and was greater in soil under spruce than in soil under grass. Also, the lipid components differed, with hexadecanoic and docosanoic acid methyl esters being the dominant compounds in humic acids from soil under spruce and hexadecanoic and octadecanoic acid methyl esters in the humic acids from grassland. A good correlation was found between previous 13 C NMR and wet chemical data and pyrolysis data, indicating that pyrolysis-methylation {{can be used for}} fast detailed chemical characterization of humic acids extracted from size separates.

40|$|The {{nonvolatile}} {{fraction of}} the oleoresin of Pinus sihestris L. was found to contain substances which inhibit growth of wheat ceoleoptile and oat mesocotyl sections in standard bioassays. The inhibition is mainly confined to the fraction of resin acids. Among the seven authentic resin acids tested, the effects of dehydroabietic and <b>abietic</b> <b>acids</b> were most sifgnificant. Palustric, pimaric and isopimaric acids were not effective in the wheat coleoptile section straight growth test. None of the substances, in the amounts tested, except for extremely high concentration, exerted an inhibitory effect on natural or IAA-induced elongation of pine hypocotyl sections. Neither was an inhibitory effect discovered in the microbiological test with the Aspergillus niger van Tiegh. The results obtained with pine hypocotyl sections, allow the conclusion that resin acids interfering {{with the results of}} standard bioassays are probably not effective as inhibitory factors in the regulation of pine tissue growth...|$|R
40|$|NoIrregular {{residues}} of {{a yellow}} deposit that {{was assumed to}} be seal fat used for waterproofing were observed in the creases of the outer surface of a pair of Inuit boots from Arctic Canada. A sample of this deposit detached from one of these areas on these boots was examined initially by FT-Raman microscopy, from which interesting and rather surprising results demanded further analysis using FT-IR and GC-MS. The non-destructive Raman spectroscopic analysis yielded spectra which indicated the presence of a tree resin from the Pinaceae sp. The Raman spectra were also characteristic of a well-preserved keratotic protein and indicative of adherent skin. Subsequent FT-IR spectroscopic analysis supported the attribution of a Pinaceae resin to the yellow deposit. GC-MS analysis of the same deposits identified the presence of pimaric, sandaracopimaric, dehydroabietic and <b>abietic</b> <b>acids,</b> all indicative of an aged Pinaceae resin. These results confirmed that the Inuit people had access to tree resins which they probably used as a waterproofing agent...|$|R

The dit gene cluster {{is located on}} a 16. 7 -kb DNA fragment containing 13 complete open reading frames (ORFs) and 1 partial ORF. The genes ditA 1 A 2 A 3 encode the α and β subunits and the ferredoxin of the dioxygenase which hydroxylates 7 -oxodehydroabietic acid to 7 -oxo- 11, 12 -dihydroxy- 8, 13 -abietadien acid. The dioxygenase mutant strain BKME- 941 (ditA 1 ::Tn 5) did not grow on nonaromatic abietanes, and transformed palustric and <b>abietic</b> <b>acids</b> to 7 -oxodehydroabietic acid in cell suspension assays. Thus, nonaromatic abietanes are aromatized prior to further degradation. Catechol 2, 3 -dioxygenase activity of xylE transcriptional fusion strains showed induction of ditA 1 and ditA 3 by abietic, dehydroabietic, and 7 -oxodehydroabietic acids, which support the growth of strain BKME- 9, {{as well as by}} isopimaric and 12, 14 -dichlorodehydroabietic acids, which are diterpenoids that do not support the growth of strain BKME- 9. In addition to the aromatic-ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase genes, the dit cluster includes ditC, encoding an extradiol ring cleavage dioxygenase, and ditR, encoding an IclR-type transcriptional regulator. Although ditR is not strictly required for the growth of strain BKME- 9 on abietanes, a ditR::Kmr mutation in a ditA 3 ::xylE reporter strain demonstrated that it encodes an inducer-dependent transcriptional activator of ditA 3.

40|$|Resin acids are {{tricyclic}} terpenoids occurring {{naturally in}} trees. We investigated {{the occurrence of}} resin acid-degrading bacteria on the Arctic tundra near the northern coast of Ellesmere Island (82 °N, 62 °W). According to most-probable-number assays, resin acid degraders were abundant (103 to 104 propagules/g of soil) in hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, but they were undetectable (< 3 propagules/g of soil) in pristine soils from the nearby tundra. Plate counts indicated that the contaminated and the pristine soils had similar populations of heterotrophs (106 to 107 propagules/g of soil). Eleven resin acid-degrading bacteria belonging to four phylogenetically distinct groups were enriched and isolated from the contaminated soils, and representative isolates of each group were further characterized. Strains DhA- 91, IpA- 92, and IpA- 93 {{are members of the}} genus Pseudomonas. Strain DhA- 95 {{is a member of the}} genus Sphingomonas. All four strains are psychrotolerant, with growth temperature ranges of 4 °C to 30 °C (DhA- 91 and DhA- 95) or 4 °C to 22 °C (IpA- 92 and IpA- 93) and with optimum temperatures of 15 to 22 °C. Strains DhA- 91 and DhA- 95 grew on the abietanes, dehydroabietic and <b>abietic</b> <b>acids,</b> but not on the pimaranes, isopimaric and pimaric acids. Strains IpA- 92 and IpA- 93 grew on the pimaranes but not the abietanes. All four strains grew on either aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, which is unusual for described resin acid degraders. Eleven mesophilic resin acid degraders did not use hydrocarbons, with the exception of two Mycobacterium sp. strains that used aliphatic hydrocarbons. We conclude that hydrocarbon contamination in Arctic tundra soil indirectly selected for resin acid degraders, selecting for hydrocarbon degraders that coincidentally use resin acids. Psychrotolerant resin acid degraders are likely important in the global carbon cycle and may have applications in biotreatment of pulp and paper mill effluents...|$|R

The UV-Raman spectra of the three compounds in ethanol/water 50 : 50 showed only very few enhanced Raman lines. SERS spectra with 514 -nm excitation with Ag colloids were also relatively weak. The best SERS spectrawere obtained with 785 -nm excitation on a novel nanostructured substrate, 'black silicon' coated with a 400 -nm gold layer.

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} shown that the {{partitioning}} of vinblastine in 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) single and multiple bilayer dispersions induces partial interdigitation of the lipid alkyl chains. Similar behavior has been observed for <b>abietic</b> and ursodeoxycholic <b>acids</b> and may well be generalized for the partitioning of bulky amphoteric molecules, which tend to localize {{in the vicinity of the}} polar heads. For the present study, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been employed to investigate the role of lipid molecular characteristics such as the alkyl chain length and the polarity of the head-group, as well as the impact of cholesterol upon vinblastine-induced interdigitation. It is found that vinblastine does not induce interdigitation in lipids with either shorter or longer alkyl chains than DPPC, or having head-groups of different polarity. In addition, it is shown that the presence of cholesterol in the lipid bilayer tends to modulate the phase behavior of the lipid/vinblastine bilayer system. Preliminary studies show that such properties directly affect the encapsulation efficiency and the pharmacokinetics of liposomes...|$|R

The research target is to determine a proper condition for manufacturing of maleic rosin which could fulfill the standard requirements. The manufacturing of maleic rosin was carried out by elevating the temperature to 160 - 170 °C and maintained it at this temperature for 2 - 3 hours. Maleic acid that was used in the process consisted of 0 %, 2 %. 4 %, 6 % and 8 %. The physico-chemical properties of the maleic rosin produced was analysed.

The data were analysed by using factorial random design, and the different value between means was calculated with Tukey procedure by the SAS computer package. The results showed that the increase in maleic acid concentration caused to increase in yield, softening points. acid value. and saponification value of maleic rosin. The ash content value, however, did not exhibit certain tendency when maleic rosin were produced under the experimental condition applied. Rosin from East Java with WW quality produced maleic rosin higher softening point and saponification value than that of from North Sumatra with WG quality.
