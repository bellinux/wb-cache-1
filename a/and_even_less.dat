5|$|Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Elder Paul Ryder, a prickly, {{judgmental}} young missionary assigned as Aaron's partner, Ryder is not {{enthusiastic about}} being in LA <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> so about living next door to a homosexual. Gordon-Levitt originally auditioned to play Aaron, but his aggressive attitude toward the script but {{good sense of humor}} made the producers decide he was a perfect Ryder.|$|E
5|$|During her lifetime, Sarah drafted twenty-six wills, {{the last}} of which was only written {{a few months before}} her death; and had {{purchased}} twenty-seven estates. With a wealth of over £4 million in land; £17,000 in rent rolls; and a further £12,500 in annuities, she made financial bequests to rising Whig ministers such as William Pitt, later the first Earl of Chatham, and Philip Stanhope, the fourth Earl of Chesterfield. Although she left little to the poor <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> to charity, she left her servants annuities far above the average for the time: her favourite, Grace Ridley, received £16,000, equivalent to approximately £1.32million in today's money.|$|E
5|$|For {{narrative}} {{history the}} principal sources are the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Irish annals. The evidence from charters {{created in the}} Kingdom of England provides occasional insight into events in northern Britain. While Scandinavian sagas describe events in 10th-century Britain, their value as sources of historical narrative, rather than documents of social history, is disputed. Mainland European sources rarely concern themselves with affairs in Britain, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> commonly with events in northern Britain, but the life of Saint Cathróe of Metz, a work of hagiography written in Germany {{at the end of}} the 10th century, provides plausible details of the saint's early life in north Britain.|$|E

5|$|In 629, the Islamic Prophet Muhammad had {{recently}} succeeded in unifying all the tribes of the Arabian Peninsula. Those tribes {{had previously been}} too divided to pose a serious military challenge to the Byzantines or the Persians. Now unified and animated by their new conversion to Islam, they comprised {{one of the most}} powerful states in the region. The first conflict between the Byzantines and Muslims was the Battle of Mu'tah in September 629. A small Muslim skirmishing force attacked the province of Arabia in response to their ambassador's murder at the hands of the Ghassanid Roman governor, but were repulsed. Because the engagement was a Byzantine victory, there was no apparent reason to make changes to the military configuration of the region. Also, the Byzantines had little preceding battlefield experience with the Arabs, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> with zealous soldiers united by a prophet. Even the Strategicon of Maurice, a manual of war praised for the variety of enemies it covers, does not mention warfare against Arabs at any length.|$|E
5|$|The De Beers company, as the world's largest diamond mining company, holds a {{dominant}} {{position in the}} industry, and has done so since soon after its founding in 1888 by the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes. De Beers is currently the world's largest operator of diamond production facilities (mines) and distribution channels for gem-quality diamonds. The Diamond Trading Company (DTC) is a subsidiary of De Beers and markets rough diamonds from De Beers-operated mines. De Beers and its subsidiaries own mines that produce some 40% of annual world diamond production. For most of the 20th century over 80% of the world's rough diamonds passed through De Beers, but by 2001–2009 the figure had decreased to around 45%, and by 2013 the company's market share had further decreased to around 38% in value terms <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> by volume. De Beers sold off {{the vast majority of}} its diamond stockpile in the late 1990s – early 2000s and the remainder largely represents working stock (diamonds that are being sorted before sale). This was well documented in the press but remains little known to the general public.|$|E
5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a horse collar than they could with a breast collar, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> with an ox yoke.|$|E

25|$|As for Poetry, {{there have}} been very few well known {{historical}} female poets, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> outed lesbian poets. Mary Oliver, a naturalist poet, is a known lesbian, but does not discuss her sexual orientation in her poems.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, many early {{participants}} in spiritualism were radical Quakers and {{others involved in}} the mid-nineteenth-century reforming movement. These reformers were uncomfortable with more prominent churches because those churches did little to fight slavery <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> to {{advance the cause of}} women's rights.|$|E
25|$|Let us {{have the}} courage to declare a first truth: International law does not give a right to {{security}} which engages, in return, a right to occupy <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> so, a right to massacre. There is a right to peace, and that right is the same for all peoples. The security which Israel seeks today, is done so against peace and against the Palestinian people.|$|E

25|$|The siege {{was lifted}} on 16 May 1900. Baden-Powell was {{promoted}} to major general, and became a national hero. However, the British military commanders were more critical of his performance <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> impressed with his subsequent choices to again allow himself be besieged. Ultimately, his failure to properly scout the situation and abandonment of the soldiers, mostly Australians and Rhodesians, at the Battle of Elands River led to his being removed from action.|$|E
25|$|Historically, Tsing Yi Island, with Kwai Chung, {{were usually}} in the same {{administration}} unit as Tsuen Wan because of their proximity and close-knit neighbourhood. Unlike Kwai Chung, however, whose villages are part of Tsuen Wan Rural Committee, Tsing Yi Island has its own, Tsing Yi Rural Committee. The rural committee was politically significant until {{the establishment of a}} District Council and Regional Council (now-abolished), <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> significant since the urban population grew much larger than the rural population.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, {{the army}} totalled 3,618 men. This was {{well below the}} 6,000 men {{requested}} by the Iraqi monarchy <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> than the British set limit of 4,500. Unattractive salaries hindered early recruiting efforts. At this time, the United Kingdom maintained the right to levy local forces like the British-officered Iraq Levies which were under direct British control. With a strength of 4,984 men, the Iraq Levies outnumbered the army with its British set limit of 4,500 men.|$|E

25|$|Soils {{with high}} clay {{contents}} or small particle sizes and high {{total organic carbon}} content {{have been shown to}} promote TNT transformation. Possible TNT transformations include reduction of one, two, or three nitro-moieties to amines and coupling of amino transformation products to form dimers. Formation of the two monoamino transformation products, 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT are energetically favored, and therefore are observed in contaminated soils and ground water. The diamino products are energetically less favorable, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> likely are the triamino products.|$|E
25|$|Raphael painted {{several of}} his works on wood support (Madonna of the Pinks) but he also used canvas (Sistine Madonna) and {{he was known to}} employ drying oils such as linseed or walnut oils. His palette was rich and he used almost all of the then {{available}} pigments such as ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, carmine, vermilion, madder lake, verdigris and ochres. In {{several of his}} paintings (Ansidei Madonna) he even employed the rare brazilwood lake, metallic powdered gold <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> known metallic powdered bismuth.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the present}} {{distribution}} of human skin colours {{does not reflect}} this correlation due to the mass migration and movement of peoples across continents in the past, there are still indigenous peoples living in ancestral environment. Polar regions of the Northern Hemisphere receive little UV radiation <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> vitamin D producing UVB {{for most of the}} year. These regions were uninhabited by humans until about 12 000 years ago. Areas like Scandinavia and Siberia have very low concentrations of ultraviolet radiation, and indigenous populations are all light-skinned.|$|E
50|$|This {{film was}} {{followed}} by a less popular sequel, Conan the Destroyer in 1984. This sequel was a more typical fantasy-genre film <b>and</b> was <b>even</b> <b>less</b> faithful to Howard's Conan stories, being just a picaresque story of an assorted bunch of adventurers.|$|R

50|$|Other polymorphs {{of calcium}} {{carbonate}} are the minerals aragonite and vaterite. Aragonite will change to calcite at 380-470 °C, <b>and</b> vaterite is <b>even</b> <b>less</b> stable.|$|R
25|$|The {{historian}} was {{not much}} read in late antiquity, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> in the Middle Ages. Only {{a third of his}} known work has survived; we depend on a single manuscript for books I-VI of the Annales and on another one for the other surviving half (books XI-XVI) and for the five books extant of the Historiae. His antipathy towards the Jews and Christians of his time—he records with unemotional contempt the sufferings of the Christians at Rome during Nero's persecution—made him unpopular in the Middle Ages. He was rediscovered, however, by the Renaissance, whose writers were impressed with his dramatic presentation of the Imperial age.|$|E
25|$|Full {{retirement}} age spouses and divorced spouses (married over 10 years before divorce) {{are entitled to}} the higher of 50% of the wage earners benefits or their own earned benefits. A low salary worker and his full {{retirement age}} spouse making {{less than or equal}} to $791/month with 40 quarters of employment credit and at full retirement age (65 if born before 1938, 66 if born from 1938 to 1954 and 67 if born after 1960) could retire with 135% of his indexed average salary. A full retirement age worker and his full retirement age spouse making the ceiling income or more would be eligible for 43% of the ceiling FICA salary (29% if single) <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> if making more than the ceiling income.|$|E
25|$|When Victorian attitudes {{took hold}} in England, studies {{with a live}} model became more {{restrictive}} {{than they had been}} in the prior century, limited to advanced classes of students that had already proved their worthiness by copying old master paintings and drawing from plaster casts. This is in part because many schools were publicly funded, so decisions were under the scrutiny of non-artists. Modeling was not respectable, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>less</b> so for women. During the same period, the French art atelier system allowed any art student to work from life in a less formal atmosphere, and also admitted women as students. Live figure studies only returned to its classical status in art education throughout the England, Europe and the United States with the approach of the 20th Century.|$|E
50|$|Duckworth's {{production}} {{began to}} slip in 1991-92, {{he was constantly}} out played at times in the 1992 NBA Finals <b>and</b> was <b>even</b> <b>less</b> productive at times throughout the following season.
