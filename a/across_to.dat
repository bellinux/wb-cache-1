5|$|For {{the series}} of Bond novels, Fleming {{realised}} that without threatening villains Bond seemed less heroic: this tradition of strong literary villain was brought <b>across</b> <b>to</b> the screen in the Eon series. The third Bond film, Goldfinger, set a pattern for having a main villain with a loyal and dangerous henchman, a model which was followed in subsequent films.|$|E
5|$|In 1864, a new {{proposal}} {{was made to}} build a pier <b>across</b> <b>to</b> the island, funded by 2,000 shares which raised £20,000. Cecil Hugh Smyth Pigott, the four-year-old son of {{the lord of the}} manor, laid the foundation stone on 28 October 1864 when a public holiday was declared in the town and a celebratory dinner was held in the Town Hall.|$|E

5|$|A {{danger to}} {{agriculture}} is wheat rust, a pathogenic fungus causing reddish patches, coloured by its spores. A virulent {{form of the}} wheat disease, stem rust, strain Ug99, spread from Africa <b>across</b> <b>to</b> the Arabian Peninsula by 2007. In field trials in Kenya, more than 85% of wheat samples, including major cultivars, were susceptible, implying that higher crop diversity was required. The Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug argued for action to ensure global food security.|$|E
5|$|After passing The Lizard {{the path}} turns northwards, {{continuing}} past Housel Bay and a building used by Guglielmo Marconi for radio experiments, then Bass Point with its Coastguard Station. The Lizard lifeboat station is a sheltered position in Kilcobben Cove. Passing through Cadgwith and across Kennack Sands, the path heads towards Black Head then into Coverack. Once around Lowland Point, The Manacles lie a mile offshore, a reef that has wrecked many ships. The path passes through Porthoustock and Porthallow, then around Nare Point lies Gillan Creek. This can be crossed {{at very low}} tide, but most walkers follow the lanes round {{the head of the}} creek to reach Dennis Head {{at the mouth of the}} Helford River. To cross this wider river means following it inland to Helford where there is a ferry <b>across</b> <b>to</b> Helford Passage on the north bank. Some people take a short cut from Gillan Creek to Helford by a path through Manaccan.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Calshot {{returned}} to duty {{as an active}} air base, housing two squadrons of Sunderland flying boats which {{took part in the}} Berlin airlift of 1948, before being passed <b>across</b> <b>to</b> Maintenance Command in 1953. The Southampton Harbour Board built a coastguard lookout tower at the castle in 1952, and the following year they began to construct a signal station tower on top of the keep, complete with radar and radio facilities, which opened in 1958. By then, military seaplanes had become obsolete, and the RAF station was finally closed in 1961.|$|E

5|$|Amésqueta left Mopán {{three days}} after Díaz and {{followed}} Díaz’s trail to the lakeshore. He arrived at the lake over a week later with 36 men. As they scouted along the south shore near Nojpetén they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. Amésqueta was extremely suspicious of the small canoes being offered by the Itza to transport his party <b>across</b> <b>to</b> Nojpetén; as nightfall approached Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of}} the morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight. At San Pedro Martír he received news of an Itza embassy to Mérida in December 1695, and an apparent formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority. Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned his unfinished fort and retreated to Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They {{range in size from}} small individuals less than half a centimetre <b>across</b> <b>to</b> large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living in deep water than in shallow, and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow to deep water and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} caught in the harbour during the Battle of Weihaiwei in early 1895, with Zhenyuan only {{partially}} seaworthy. They were unable to prevent the capture of the port's fortifications by the Japanese, and underwent nightly attacks by torpedo boats. Dingyuen was hit by a torpedo and began to sink. She was quickly beached, where she settled into the mud, and continued {{to be used as a}} defensive fort. Admiral Ruchang's flag was subsequently moved <b>across</b> <b>to</b> Zhenyuan. Following Ruchang's suicide, the surrender of the port and the fleet was arranged. Dingyuen was blown up by the Japanese forces, as they were unable to salvage her, although there is a suggestion following an eye witness account that she may have been mined by the Chinese.|$|E

5|$|Diệm then visited New York City, {{where he}} was given a tickertape parade through Manhattan, which was {{attended}} by 250,000. He was presented with several honors by the city council and given a civic reception, before attending several functions with business leaders, marketing his country as a favorable location for foreign investment. The South Vietnamese president also made stops at the city's main Roman Catholic institution, St Patrick's Cathedrala Catholic, Diệm had been helped to power by the lobbying of Cardinal Francis Spellman and American Catholic politicians. He also returned to Maryknoll Seminirary where he had stayed while in exile, and to the Catholic Seton Hall University to receive an honorary doctorate. Diệm later received an honorary degree from Michigan State University, where he had stayed in exile earlier in the decade and the day was dedicated in his honor. The South Vietnamese president then traveled westwards <b>across</b> <b>to</b> the pacific coast before returning to Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{played the}} {{formation}} {{typical of the}} era: two full-backs, three half-backs and five forwards. With Tilson absent from the Manchester City line-up, Alec Herd moved <b>across</b> <b>to</b> Tilson's usual centre-forward position, and Bobby Marshall was selected at inside-right. For Everton, Albert Geldard who was injured for the semi-final was selected at outside right, and Ted Critchley who scored the winning goal in the FA Cup semi-final, was {{left out of the}} side.|$|E
5|$|Haifa has {{developed}} in tiers, {{from the lower}} to the upper city on the Carmel. The oldest neighborhood in modern Haifa is Wadi Salib, the Old City center near the port, which has been bisected by a major road and razed in part {{to make way for}} government buildings. Wadi Salib stretches <b>across</b> <b>to</b> Wadi Nisnas, the center of Arab life in Haifa today. In the 19th century, under Ottoman rule, the German Colony was built, providing the first model of urban planning in Haifa. Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife.|$|E

5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape had changed dramatically after the White Ship disaster. Around three hundred passengers – including Matilda's brother William Adelin {{and many other}} senior nobles – embarked one night on the White Ship to travel from Barfleur in Normandy <b>across</b> <b>to</b> England. The vessel foundered just outside the harbour, possibly {{as a result of}} overcrowding or excessive drinking by the ship's master and crew, and all but two of the passengers died. William Adelin was among the casualties.|$|E
5|$|In 1830, President Andrew Jackson {{had signed}} the Indian Removal Act, which {{authorized}} {{the government to}} remove any Indian nations east of the Mississippi River <b>across</b> <b>to</b> the western side and offer land in exchange. As northern Wisconsin was not then under pressure for development by white settlers, as occurred in the Southeast, the Ojibwa were not among the first targets of the act. They watched closely as the government used the territorial claims defined by tribes in 1825 to force numerous tribes in Indiana, southern Michigan and southern Wisconsin to move west to Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and Indian Territory, present-day Oklahoma. These included the Odawa and Potawatomi, two Anishinaabe tribes closely related to and allied with the Ojibwa.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Crawford starred {{opposite}} Ramón Novarro in <b>Across</b> <b>to</b> Singapore, {{but it was}} {{her role}} as Diana Medford in Our Dancing Daughters (1928) that catapulted her to stardom. The role established her as a symbol of modern 1920s-style femininity which rivaled Clara Bow, the original It girl, then Hollywood's foremost flapper. A stream of hits followed Our Dancing Daughters, including two more flapper-themed movies, in which Crawford embodied for her legion of fans (many of whom were women) an idealized vision of the free-spirited, all-American girl.|$|E

5|$|In the {{original}} Holliday model for homologous recombination, single-strand breaks {{occur at the}} same point on one strand of each parental DNA. Free ends of each broken strand then migrate <b>across</b> <b>to</b> the other DNA helix. There, the invading strands are joined to the free ends they encounter, resulting in the Holliday junction. As each crossover strand reanneals to its original partner strand, it displaces {{the original}} complementary strand ahead of it. This causes the Holliday junction to migrate, creating the heteroduplex segments. Depending on which strand was used as a template to repair the other, the four cells resulting from meiosis might end up with three copies of one allele and only one of the other, instead of the normal two of each, a property known as gene conversion.|$|E
5|$|Low's tactics {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} hoisting false colours and approaching an unsuspecting vessel. Off {{the coast of}} St John's, Newfoundland, Low mistook a fully armed man-of-war for a fishing boat, and barely escaped. He moved on to Conception Bay, capturing a number of boats around the Grand Banks southeast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic to the Azores. There, he captured a French (or Portuguese—sources differ) pink, a narrow-sterned former man of war, which Low rearmed and refitted as his new flagship, naming it the Rose Pink. He also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard. Low had his crew hoist them up and drop them back down from the yard arm several times, until they died. He {{moved on to the}} Canaries, Cape Verde and then back <b>across</b> <b>to</b> the coast of Brazil, where he was driven back by foul weather.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 2011, the Australian Minister for Defence Materiel, Jason Clare, {{announced}} that the Sea Kings would be withdrawn from service in December 2011; having flown in excess of 60,000 hours in operations in Australia and overseas in that time. The farewell flight was conducted on 15 December 2011, three Sea Kings flew over Sydney Harbour and <b>across</b> <b>to</b> Canberra, passing Lake Burley Griffin and the Australian War Memorial before landing at Nowra. On 16 December 2011, the Chief of Navy presided over the ceremonial decommissioning of 817 Squadron RAN at NAS Nowra. Five of the withdrawn helicopters have been made available for sale.
