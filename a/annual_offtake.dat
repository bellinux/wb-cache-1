40|$|A model {{describing}} livestock grazing {{system dynamics}} {{was developed and}} fitted to available data. This study preliminarily explored {{the use of a}} formal management procedure (MP) approach to determine appropriate <b>annual</b> <b>offtake</b> in a terrestrial system. This approach has been applied in marine systems with great success, but has never been tried in terrestrial ecosystems. Rangelands and marine systems have in common {{the fact that there is}} often an offtake component to them and so stakeholders in those systems need knowledge of optimal harvesting strategies within defined management strategies. Three models were developed that described the growth of female goats in Paulshoek. The first (basic livestock model) depicted the growth of livestock as a logistic equation with an adult survival term and an annual growth term. The second model (rainfall-livestock model) added a rainfall component, with livestock productivity modelled as a function of rainfall. The final version of the model (vegetation-rainfall-livestock model) added a vegetation component that interacted with rainfall and livestock. The rainfall-livestock model provided a statistically significant better fit to the data, followed by the vegetation-rainfall model. The vegetation-rainfall-livestock model provided a reasonable representation of livestock population changes through time, with the largest deviations evident over the period 1975 - 1980. Results show that environmental factors alone are unable to fully explain observed system dynamics because anthropogenic factors for which no data are available may also play a role. Preliminary exploration with a simple MP suggested that a low offtake rate of 10 % provided the highest average <b>annual</b> <b>offtake.</b> Our study has shown that a rangeland stocking system can be reasonably described by a simple model that uses only rainfall data and a rainfall-vegetation-livestock interaction. Rangeland livestock systems would benefit greatly from adopting an MP approach as it would allow stakeholders to make informed decisions on stocking rates and <b>annual</b> <b>offtake...</b>|$|E
40|$|Hunting of {{wildlife}} in Central Africa is largely {{considered to be}} unsustainable. Several studies indicate that most mammal species should already have disappeared from many Central African forests but markets continue to be supplied with bushmeat, {{with no sign of}} large scale extinction of the most common species. Most studies of the sustainability of duiker (Cephalophus spp.) hunting in Central Africa are based on the same index of hunting. We illustrate how uncertainty is accumulated in these estimations of sustainability. We show that the results obtained in different sites are not comparable because a variety of methods have been used to calculate the parameters of the model and each of the methods has different sources of error. For the assessment of maximum sustainable harvest for duikers, the studies reviewed differ mainly in the value chosen for the hypothetical adjustment factor, and the method used to calculate the rate of maximum population increase and to estimate duiker population densities. For the assessment of annual hunting offtake the studies differ mainly in the scale at which they were conducted (village or regional), and sampling and extrapolation methods. Without evaluation of accuracy and standardization of methods for the estimation of maximum sustainable harvest and <b>annual</b> <b>offtake,</b> conclusions regarding harvesting based on biological indices should be treated with extreme cautio...|$|E
40|$|The Mentawai Archipelago (West-Sumatra, Indonesia) {{harbours}} {{a wealth}} of endemic animals and plants including six unique primate species, all threatened by habitat loss and hunting. Although hunting {{is known to be}} widespread, little systematic work has been carried out to examine its scale and impact on Mentawai´s primate populations. Here we report an island-wide survey carried out on Siberut, the archipelago’s largest island, to assess hunting behaviour with respect to the four locally-occurring primate species, as well as the attitudes of indigenous inhabitants to resource utilization. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in mid- 2012 with 390 respondents from 50 villages using a structured questionnaire. Overall, ca. one quarter of the respondents (24 %) are still active hunters, generally targeting Simias concolor (77 %), Macaca siberu (71 %) and Presbytis siberu (68 %); Hylobates klossii is rarely hunted (3 %). Mostly, a single animal is captured per hunt, with average numbers per three months ranging from 1. 9 - 2. 3 individuals (for S. concolor, M. siberu and P. siberu). We found that in many aspects our data did not differ between the protected area (Siberut National Park) {{and the rest of the}} island, although hunting was significantly more prevalent within the protected area’s boundaries. Our approximation of <b>annual</b> <b>offtake</b> leads us to conclude that no less than 4, 800 primates are taken every year (min. 6. 4 % of the population). We provide recommendations on how to reduce hunting as a driver for population decline. </a...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out on 92 {{smallholder}} farms in Kwale district in Coast Province of Kenya to estimate the milk yield. The effect of concentrate feed supplementation on milk yield was also evaluated. Data were collected during a one-year observational longitudinal study. Analysis was done for 371 observations following 63 calving events. The mean <b>annual</b> milk <b>offtake</b> was estimated at 2021 kg/cow. Forty-nine (77. 8 %) of the lactating cows were supplemented with concentrate feeds at varying rates of 0. 5 - 3. 0 kg/cow per day. Supplementary feeding of lactating cows led to a significantly higher mean daily milk yield compared to non-supplemented cows throughout the year (p< 0. 05). The mean <b>annual</b> milk <b>offtake</b> from supplemented cows (2195 kg/cow) was 18. 6 % more than offtake from non-supplemented cows, a difference that was statistically significant (p< 0. 05). Therefore, supplementary feeding of commercial feed concentrates was a rational management practice. It was also concluded that milk production from smallholder dairy cows in the coastal lowlands of Kenya was comparable to that from similar production systems but lower than national targets...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} on restricted suckling of crossbred dairy cows {{was conducted at}} the Livestock Research Centre, Tanga in north-east Tanzania. The objective of the experiment was to evaluate the comparative productivity of Bos taurus x Bos indicus cows of medium {{and high levels of}} Bos taurus inheritance, whose calves were either bucket-reared or suckled residual milk. Lactation milk yield, length and persistency were 1563 L, 289 days, and 1. 0, respectively, for the bucket-reared and 1592 L, 289 days and 1. 4, respectively, for the suckling group. Days to observed oestrus, first insemination and conception for cows whose calves were bucket-reared were 47, 74 and 115 days, respectively, and 57, 81 and 126 days, respectively, for the suckling cows. The calf weights were similar at 1 year of age. The productivity of the cows, measured as the <b>annual</b> milk <b>offtake,</b> was not significantly higher for those that suckled their calves than for those whose calves were bucket-reared...|$|R
40|$|Management zones feature {{prominently}} in conservation planning, particularly at large spatial scales, but prioritization of {{areas of concern}} is required to focus efforts and limited resources. Human-mediated mortality constitutes {{a major threat to}} species persistence, particularly for widespread carnivores that undergo harvest and population control, such as the leopard (Panthera pardus). In this study, we evaluated the extent and spatial distribution of legal anthropogenic offtake of leopards to identify de facto refugia and ecological traps across Limpopo Province, South Africa. We defined refugia as management units with offtake levels below an established sustainable harvest rate, and ecological traps as management units with offtake exceeding the sustainable harvest rate. We assessed offtake at three geographical scales using trophy hunting permit records alone, and then in combination with problem leopard permit records to investigate the compounding effect of additional forms of offtake and the potential for management scale mismatching. Across Limpopo Province, high leopard offtake created fewer areas of refuge than ecological traps. Refugia were smaller in size and within close proximity of ecological traps. Human-mediated leopard mortality occurred mostly in prime leopard habitat. Finerscaled management units resulted in fewer ecological traps and more refugia, and enables authorities to focus conservation attention in areas of concern. Human-mediated leopard mortality exceeded the <b>annual</b> <b>offtake</b> rate considered sustainable. Our study highlights the importance of assessing both the scale and distribution of the harvest, whilst also considering alternative forms of offtake, when devising harvest management strategies. Management scale mismatching and high human-mediated leopard mortality is of particular concern in Limpopo Province, as such, we propose an adaptive, science-based regulatory framework aimed at improving leopard harvest strategies.

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the population size, density, distribution, habitat utilization and biomass of large herbivores in Hell's Gate National Park and two neighbouring ranches, Kedong and Kongoni. The study further determined primary production and wildlife grazing in the Park grassland, the effects of wildlife on the vegetation around the Park's artificial water troughs {{and the effects of}} Maasai livestock and geothermal prospecting on the Park vegetation. Herbivore counts were carried out in Hell's Gate National Park and the two neighbouring ranches between February 1990 and April 1992. Kongoni, zebra and Thomson's gazelle were found to be the most abundant species. The distribution pattern exhibited by the ungulates in the three areas was neither random or regular, and appeared to be influenced by both topography and vegetation type. Dry and wet season distribution patterns of the wildlife were similar. In the three study areas, most of the herbivores were found to prefer the grassland followed by relatively open shrubland. Areas of dense vegetation and rugged terrain were not preferred. Kongoni, zebra, eland and buffalo contributed the highest proportion of the herbivore biomass. They contributed 82 % of the total herbivore biomass in the Park, 85 % in Kedong Ranch and 82 % in Kongoni Ranch. The herbivore biomass fluctuated monthly depending on population fluctuations, such that when there was a high count of the herbivores in a given month, there was a corresponding high biomass. Above-ground primary production and herbivore grazing were estimated in the Park grassland which was the main grazing area for most of the ungulates. There were two peaks of primary production which coincided with the occurence of the long and short rains, such that there was a significant linear regression between net primary production and rainfall. The monthly amount of dead and live grass biomass fluctuated in response to seasonal rainfall, such that during the dry season the amount of dead biomass increased while that of the live biomass decreased and vice versa during the wet season. There was a significant linear regression of live grass biomass on rainfall, but there was no significant correlation between rainfall and dead grass biomass. The annual productivity of the grassland was 720 g/m 2 /yr, and the total <b>annual</b> <b>offtake</b> of the grass forage by the herbivores was 12. 7 %. Therefore, most of the grass forage dried up to form dead biomass which was probably of little food value to the wildlife. The effect of both wildlife trampling on the vegetation around three artificial water troughs and illegal livestock grazing on the Park vegetation (in the Narasha area) were studied between April 1990 and April 1992. Overall, vegetation cover between the trampled and untrampled areas of the water troughs did not show any significant difference. Trampling also did not lead to any overall difference in plant species composition, diversity and abundance between the trampled and untrampled areas. Livestock grazing at Narasha did not lead to a significant difference in percentage vegetation cover and mean species diversity between the grazed and ungrazed areas. Although some plant species were only found in either the grazed or ungrazed areas, overall, grazing appeared not to lead to a significant difference in plant species composition and abundance between the two areas. It was therefore concluded that livestock grazing was not altering the Park vegetation in any significant way. The long term future of the Hell's Gate ecosystem (the Park together with the surrounding ranches) as a self sustaining unit requires that its current ecological integrity be maintained. The human activities that are taking place within it, especially expansion of agriculture, will determine its future, and if not controlled will lead to loss of wildlife habitats and a decline in the population size of the various herbivore species found within it...|$|E
40|$|Data on {{approximately}} 4, 000 head of N'Dama cattle kept in 60 herds under traditional {{management systems}} in The Gambia were analysed to estimate <b>annual</b> herd <b>offtake</b> rates during a 5 year period (1986 - 1990). Farm-gate sale prices and weight at sale of 428 cattle were analysed by least-squares ANOVA to determine factors influencing prices. Similarly, pre-slaughter and carcass characteristics data on 1, 724 N'Dama cattle {{collected from the}} national abattoir, Abuko, in 1989 / 90 were analysed. Results from the analyses showed very low animal off take rates (< 7 percent). Prices during the years following the devaluation of the local currency were higher than those charged during the pre-devaluation year. The asset value of cattle, even for those considered unproductive, increased higher relative to cash savings that would have accrued had the animals been sold prior to the devaluation. Analysis of the carcass data showed high reproductive wastage through slaughtering of pregnant cows in response to dry season feed shortages. This action was considered economically sound as the alternative was death of the stock. It was concluded that the reluctance of traditional stock owners to sell animals may in part stem from economic consideration and that when faced with production constraints such as shortfalls in feed supplies, farmers do sell animals readily. However, stock sold in emaciated conditions as observed {{in this study are}} not likely to meet the requirements of importers or attract good prices at the local markets...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the growth}} and {{geographic}} expansion of wolf (Canis lupus) populations reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho in 1995 – 1996, Rocky Mountain wolves {{were removed from the}} endangered species list in May 2009. Idaho and Montana immediately established hunting seasons with quotas equaling 20 % of the regional wolf population. Combining hunting with predator control, 37. 1 % of Montana and Idaho wolves were killed in the year of delisting. Hunting and predator control are well-established methods to broaden societal acceptance of large carnivores, but it is unprecedented for a species to move so rapidly from protection under the Endangered Species Act to heavy direct harvest, and it is important to use all available data to assess the likely consequences of these changes in policy. For wolves, it is widely argued that human offtake has little effect on total mortality rates, so that a harvest of 28 – 50 % per year can be sustained. Using previously published data from 21 North American wolf populations, we related total annual mortality and population growth to <b>annual</b> human <b>offtake.</b> Contrary to current conventional wisdom, there was a strong association between human offtake and total mortality rates across North American wolf populations. Human offtake was associated with a strongly additive or super-additive increase in total mortality. Population growth declined as human offtake increased, even at low rates of offtake. Finally, wolf populations declined with harvests substantially lower than the thresholds identified in current state and federal policies. These results should help to inform management of Rock...|$|R
40|$|Hunting through {{illegal and}} legal means is {{increasingly}} recognised {{as a threat}} to the sustainability of wildlife populations in reserves throughout Africa. Despite this, in Tanzania, legal hunting has persisted and serves as a source of revenue for conserving these species. Poaching remains a major threat to wildlife populations in many parks and reserves of Tanzania and wildlife habitats are diminishing due to human activities. I examined the impacts of hunting on the long-term persistence of four wild ungulates; impala (Aepyceros melampus Matschie), Thomson's gazelle (Gazella thomsonii Gunther), wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus Thomas) and zebra (Equus burchellii Matschie) around Tarangire National Park, in northern Tanzania. I investigated the population sizes of these species using Distance sampling method and determined there were 4534 plus or minus 1393 impala 1398 plus or minus 491 Thomson's gazelle, 5199 plus or minus 2670 wildebeest, and 11223 plus or minus 4216 zebra, in the study area. I obtained an estimate of the legal offtake over a five year period from data provided by hunting companies and districts offices in charge of hunting in the area to establish an average size of <b>annual</b> legal <b>offtake</b> of the area. I estimated the poaching levels for each species using random response method by interviewing 298 household respondents within communities living around the area. This established that illegal kill were 2 - 3 times higher than legal offtake for all four animal species except zebra. The total annual harvests were 6. 6 % for impala, 18. 2 % for Thomson's gazelle, 5. 2 % for wildebeest and 2 % for zebra, of population sizes. Using literature review I obtained vital life-history parameters for each species either from within Tarangire, or elsewhere in East Africa. The long-term viability of the four species was then examined under a computer program-VORTEX by constructing a series of models to test the effects of different hunting regimes. The models integrated mortality and fecundity rates, species population sizes and harvest (legal and illegal) rates. Of the four species, impala and Thomson's gazelle fared badly under all simulations, with up to 76 % and 68 % respectively of the modelled populations going extinct within 100 years under present 3 hunting levels. Wildebeest and zebra were more resilient to hunting. Zebra populations remained robust under current hunting rates. However, its population will slowly decline towards extinction when the hunting exceeds the current rate of 2 %. The population of wildebeest will decline towards extinction if the current offtake of 5 % persists. The impacts of illegal hunting are severe. This study is the first attempt to characterise the dynamics of the harvested ungulate populations in Tarangire, Tanzania. Poor understanding of this ecosystem especially on the demographic variables of these species, limit firm conclusions. Nevertheless, the findings presented here suggest that VORTEX modelling may be a useful tool for managing hunting at Tarangire and for highlighting research priorities...|$|R
