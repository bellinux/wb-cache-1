40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the sources and {{magnitude}} of variation in accrual <b>adjusted</b> gross farm <b>revenue</b> and farm revenue net of feed purchases on Michigan dairy farms representative of Upper Midwest dairy farms. The paper aims to assess whether adjusted gross revenue-type insurance instruments meet insurability conditions when applied to dairy farms. Design/methodology/approach – Accrual <b>adjusted</b> dairy farm <b>revenue</b> and revenue net of feed purchased from Michigan dairy farm panel data from 1995 through 2006 were detrended and summarized. Variance decomposition was used to identify sources of variation in <b>adjusted</b> gross <b>revenue</b> and <b>adjusted</b> gross <b>revenue</b> less feed purchases. In-sample insurance premiums were estimated and Monte Carlo simulations were used to adjust these premiums for out-of-sample considerations. Findings – Milk price variation was the largest source of variation while milk production per cow varied little. Farms with smaller herds and those with larger percentages of farm revenue from crop sales had higher relative revenue variability and would trigger a higher frequency of indemnities under a whole farm revenue insurance contract. Research limitations/implications – Because the data analyzed conclude in 2006, the volatility of the past couple of years is not reflected. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed insurance feasibility further with more recent data. Practical implications – The paper addresses considerations for the development and commercialization of a feasible dairy revenue insurance instrument. Originality/value – This paper fulfils a need to understand magnitude and source of revenue variation on dairy farms and how insurance might mitigate negative consequences of this variation.

Resolved: Exceptions: Description: The imposition of guaranteed issue requirements and the implementation of exchanges seem likely to lead to much greater mobility of subscribers from one issuer to another. This means that the demographic composition of an issuer’s subscribers could change much more quickly than in the past, so that premium rates based on current demographics {{would be less likely to}} appropriately reflect the demographics of the population to which the rates will actually apply in the future.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has recognized cloud computing {{as a new}} paradigm of servitization in which software products are offered based on service contracts. Thus, instead of selling software licenses, software vendors can rent {{software as a service}} to customers. However, it is still unclear how software providers can use software renting as a competitive strategy in the software market. Based on 37 interviews with software professionals from five case firms, this paper focuses on the connection between competitive forces and the factors influencing the selection of a pricing model. The findings indicate that servitization of the software offering makes it possible to <b>adjust</b> <b>revenue</b> and pricing strategies relative to market competition. Depending on the competitive situation in the market, firms apply mixed revenue models, or else a hybrid pricing mechanism, to protect their business against rivalry and substitutes. The software renting model has several advantages which significantly help software vendors to expand their business opportunities. However, in some cases, powerful customers are able to limit the revenue and pricing options. The findings also indicate that software renting is related to cost leadership and differentiation strategies, whereas software licensing is linked to a focus strategy...|$|R

The intent of this report is to assist policy-makers faced with decisions about changes to traditional utility regulation and planning. This report is not a consensus document, rather it is staff written summary of two years of discussion on the issues. As a concept, least-cost planning has been discussed since the 1970 `s and many states have implemented such programs since the mid- 1980 `s. Yet, the actual goals and objectives of least-cost planning remain a source of controversy between affected interest groups. Some industry observers believe that least-cost planning can help reconcile the often conflicting demands between increased capacity requirements and concerns about the external costs of power production.
