The traditional elite, consisting of the upper classes, who had been overthrown from political power by the Ba'athists, felt threatened by the Ba'ath Party's socialist policies. The Muslim Brotherhood in Syria was a historical rival of the Syrian Regional Branch, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> threatened by the party's secular nature. Akram al-Hawrani and his supporters and the Syrian Communist Party opposed the one-party system which the Ba'ath Party was establishing.|$|E

Despite what it appears on camera, Flannery was not completely topless, as she was wearing pasties. The scene was shot several times; Flannery admitted that the shooting was excruiating <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> like they had been shooting the one scene for [...] "14 hours". To preserve Flannery's modesty, the series' monitors were shut off and the memory card for the digital camera was removed. Carell actually took pictures during the Christmas party shoot. All of the photos were released online.|$|E

[...] AllMusic compared the songs to ambient music by the Aphex Twin, while Exclaim! noted that [...] "Quique follows a similar path as Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient work but with structures that a more rock-based band like Chapterhouse dreamed of matching." [...] The members of Seefeel were fans of Aphex Twin and said after playing shows with him and Autechre that they felt [...] "more affinity with them {{than many of the}} bands we'd met â€“ Robin Guthrie and the Cocteau Twins excepted!" ...|$|E

So we boarded the sequence to the music, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> like such a better ending than any song we could have written on our own." [...] The writers gave it a freeze-frame shot for the ending. Greenblatt's favorite part was director Springer's drawings of Patrick on the electric drums and SpongeBob saying, [...] "It's the thrill of one more kill" [...] (an excerpt from [...] "Sweet Victory").

500|$|This episode reintroduces and {{resolves}} Veronica's rape, introduced {{earlier in}} the season. However, it had been largely ignored until {{this point in the}} series. The episode was the third and final episode of the series directed by Marcos Siega, after [...] "Drinking the Kool-Aid" [...] and [...] "Mars vs. Mars". In addition, the episode marks regular writer Diane Ruggiero's sixth writing credit for the show. After the episode aired, Rob Thomas called the episode [...] "our high-water mark". Commenting on Ruggiero writing the episode, he stated, [...] "She was really my right hand writing the series, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> good to have someone who knew the voices as well as I did. We were both in a comfort zone, both writing this show and writing with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Bowman used {{a couple}} of {{specific}} camera techniques for the scenes on board the Stargazer during Picard's hallucinations. A steadicam attached to a cameraman was used to show a slight unsteadiness, {{and each of the}} Stargazer crew members were filmed individually on the bridge against a smoke background before being superimposed together. He explained, [...] "we went dark in a lot of scenes and we did different angles and things the show hadn't done yet. For me, it was a real creative stretch <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> great for the show." [...] The bridge itself was a re-dress of the film-era Klingon Bird of Prey bridge. The term [...] "Picard Maneuver" [...] was later used offscreen to refer informally to Patrick Stewart's habit of tugging his uniform shirt down, and the Battle of Maxia itself was described in the first chapter of the pre-TNG era novel The Buried Age.|$|E
500|$|The {{couple were}} {{separated}} {{for long periods}} at a time, as Dash recalled that Aaliyah continuously shot films and would be gone for months often to come back shortly and continue her schedule. Dash was also committed to [...] "his own thing", which did not make matters any better. Despite this, they were understanding that {{the time they had}} together was special. Dash remembered they would [...] "be {{in a room full of}} people talking to each other <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> like everyone was listening but it would be just us. It would be like we were the only ones in the room". Dash always felt their time together was essential and Aaliyah was the person he was interested in being with, which is why, as he claimed, they had begun speaking about engagement. The relationship was mentioned in the lyrics of Jay-Z's remix to her song [...] "Miss You", released after her death.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the band}} members have {{expressed}} their dissatisfaction with All Hope Is Gone and {{is considered to be}} their least favorite Slipknot album. Feeling discontent over the record's production process, Root said, [...] "it felt a little bit rushed. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> like we were trying to do things just to appease a schedule, which I didn't really like." [...] Root was particularly disappointed with the record's producer, Dave Fortman, and said, [...] "Dave Fortman really helped me appreciate Rick Rubin as a producer. [...] wasn't able to get nine people together on the same page and, to me, that's {{the most important thing in}} making a Slipknot record." [...] Conversely, Jordison said, [...] "It's finally the record that I've wanted Slipknot to sound like." [...] He went on to compliment Fortman's ear for tone, and considered All Hope Is Gone to be the band's best album. All Hope Is Gone was mixed by Colin Richardson in Miloco's The Engine Room studio in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|The pyx was a {{rosewood}} box, [...] square, of European work, {{and sealed}} by heavy padlocks. [...] It was not filled by the coins put {{aside for the}} 1934 Assay Commission, of which there were 759 with a total face value of $12,050. This had increased by 1940 to 79,847 coins, all silver as gold coins were no longer being struck, and by 1941, many reserved coins could not be kept in the pyx, instead being placed in packing boxes, overflowing with sealed envelopes. By the late 1940s, more than ten million coins were being struck each day at Philadelphia alone; in 1947, Congress {{reduced the number of}} silver coins required to be put aside for assay from one in 2,000 to one in 10,000. This was done at the urging of the Department of the Treasury, as having to store so many assay coins was a burden to the Mint, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> that the number of coins available to the commission [...] would still be sufficient.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with New York Magazine, Matsoukas explained her response to BeyoncÃ©'s proposal: [...] "I was like, 'Let's get into the toxic world and what we really do that is so damaging to ourselves, {{and use it as}} a microcosm for our society'. Obviously, those ideas don't just live in the pageant world; they live in our world. And that's what the song is about. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> like we had to take it there to make it have meaning, because otherwise it would be a superficial, preachy kind of song and visual." [...] A scene from the clip which depicts BeyoncÃ© preparing plastic surgery, consuming diet pills and vomiting, was initially excluded from the video's final cut. However, BeyoncÃ© decided to include the scene to fulfill her role in the clip's premise. Another scene featuring BeyoncÃ© drowning in water while the beauty contest's host questions her life aspirations, was originally intended to depict her falling onstage. However, the scene failed to surface because of time constraints.|$|E

500|$|Negative {{commentary}} {{came from}} Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone who reviewed {{the show at}} Madison Square Garden and was disappointed, calling it [...] "a run-of-the-mill arena-rock show, the kind where a band has a shoddy new album to flog". He was not impressed that Gaga chose to ignore songs from Born This Way and its successful singles. Dan DeLuca from Philadelphia Daily News wrote that [...] "the show was seriously marred by too many electro powered would-be dance cuts from ARTPOP whose weaknesses were exposed whenever she reached back to her more enticing greatest hits" [...] and that she performed [...] "far too many songs" [...] from Artpop. The Boston Globe writer James Reed felt that [...] "something" [...] was missing from Gaga's performance, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> [...] "hollow". He also criticized Gaga's reliance on backing tracks to sing her songs. Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle found the show to be [...] "disjointed", saying that there was [...] "little {{in the way of}} real transition between sequences, particularly in the later moments." ...|$|E
500|$|.....that was so hard, it's just, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> strained, {{and as a}} result, I'm {{happy that}} I worked hard to do those, because those English {{versions}} are really good and [...] "Simple and Clean," [...] I think, {{is a really good}} song, and people- most of the people that know me here, they know me for that- but it's not ideal for me as a writer, to- because, actually, I changed the melodies for [...] "Simple and Clean" [...] and [...] "Hikari," [...] because when you change the language you're singing in, the same melodies don't work- and as a writer, it's just very frustrating to have, like- I wrote these melodies for Japanese words, and to have to write in English for that, it's just not right. And then, so, for this, uh, this contract with Island Def Jam, in the beginning I separated it to this English language album, and I don't do Japanese translations. I just, my integrity as an artist just would not take that, could not take that." ...|$|E
500|$|The track [...] "Old Age", whose organ intro was {{featured}} on the band's cover of [...] "Credit In The Straight World" [...] from Live Through This, was revealed to have originally written by Kurt Cobain; Love stated in a 1997 interview that [...] "Old Age" [...] was [...] "partly someone else's composition. It's something somebody {{had a little bit}} of and I said 'let me have the rest of it' and I wrote this thing in it and tried to make it goth. I found it, wrote it, and recorded it the same night." [...] It was later revealed that a version of the song was recorded by Nirvana during the Nevermind (1991) recording sessions, but Cobain threw the song out, later giving the melody to Love, who rearranged musical pieces and rewrote the lyrics. Two live cover versions were included on the album: [...] "Season of the Witch" [...] by Donovan, and [...] "He Hit Me (<b>And</b> <b>It</b> <b>Felt</b> Like a Kiss)", which was written by Carole King and recorded by The Crystals in the 1960s. Love referred to it as a [...] "feminist anthem" [...] after performing it during MTV Unplugged in 1995.|$|E

500|$|The {{band members}} stated that {{following}} the troublesome final years signed to Geffen Records, being an independent act again helped improve their mood and approach, with Vig remarking, [...] "There were no expectations; {{no one even}} knew we were recording. So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> a lot like it did when we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form. You can't keep treating it like sausage meat. You have to let it morph and move and breathe." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics commended the {{development}} of the relationship between Maggie Green and Glenn. Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun stated that the storyline epitomized a [...] "steamy romance", while The Wall Street Journal Aaron Rutkoff called it [...] "the funniest moment of the series." [...] Goldman opined that their sexual encounter felt genuine; [...] "He's a nice guy, she seems like a cool gal, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> genuine when she noted she felt plenty lonely too and ready for some companionship." [...] Nick Venable of Cinema Blend asserted that the interactions between Maggie and Glenn was the highlight of the episode. [...] "I'm glad the writers are introducing this comic book plot point, as this show seriously needs a couple without closets full of skeletons. When Glenn accidentally grabs a box of condoms for Maggie to see, I chuckled heartily. The ensuing conversation also made me smile, which makes me wonder why humor is paid the least amount of attention on the show." [...] Jackson was surprised with the scene, and called it [...] "unexpected". Jen Chenay of The Washington Post compared Glenn to Little Mikey from the Life advertisements, and summated: [...] "He has assumed this role without much choice in the matter, but he has done so with a certain quiet, occasionally petrified, baseball-cap-wearing dignity that makes him admirable." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{features}} {{the deaths of}} Patricia and Jimmy, who were both consumed by walkers. Alongside {{the deaths of the}} aforementioned characters, the episode's script initially called for the deaths of Hershel, as well as Shane Walsh and Randall, both of whom had died in the previous installment. Since Kirkman felt {{that there was a lot}} of potential development in Hershel, his death was scrapped from the script. Although plans to write off the character commenced earlier in the season, Mazzara opined that his hypothetical death would have carried no emotional resonance. [...] "The plan was always to whack Hershel, and I actually told Scott Wilson, 'Thanks for everything you've done, but in the next script we're going to kill off your character.' We started writing that <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> like Hershel's death was playing as a plot device and we were getting no emotional resonance. It was just playing as a gratuitous death. This was one of those examples where we won't play a shocking death for the sense of death; we have to get something out of it. We got nothing out of it. If you look at the shot of Hershel looking back and seeing that barn burning and his farm completely lost to the zombies, that shot was well worth it because we see the farm was really a character and you can only see that through Hershel's eyes. So it was the right call to keep him alive." ...|$|E
