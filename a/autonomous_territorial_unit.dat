50|$|The Bosniak {{leadership}} initially showed {{willingness to}} remain in a rump Yugoslavia, but later changed their policy and opted for independence. The Croat leadership started organizing themselves in Croat-majority areas and on 18 November 1991 established the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia as an <b>autonomous</b> Croat <b>territorial</b> <b>unit.</b> At a meeting in December 1991 with the HDZ BiH leadership Tuđman discussed the possibility of joining Herzeg-Bosnia to Croatia as he thought that Bosnian representatives were working {{to remain in}} Yugoslavia. There he criticized HDZ BiH president Stjepan Kljujić for siding with Izetbegović. However, in February 1992 he encouraged Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina to support the upcoming Bosnian independence referendum. Izetbegović declared the country's independence on 6 April that was immediately recognised by Croatia. At {{the beginning of the}} Bosnian war a Croat-Bosniak alliance was formed, though it was often not harmonious. The Croatian government helped arm both Croat and Bosniak forces. On 21 July 1992, the Agreement on Friendship and Cooperation was signed by Tuđman and Izetbegović, establishing a military cooperation between the two armies. In September 1992 they signed two more agreements on cooperation and further negotiations regarding the internal organization of Bosnia and Herzegovina, though Izetbegović rejected a military pact. In January 1993 Tuđman said that Bosnia and Herzegovina can survive only as a confederal union of three nations.|$|R

The main goal of the workshop was to reveal the potential of the “meso-historical analysis” {{in the study of the}} Mongol Empire, including the simultaneous consideration of global changes in Eurasia caused by the creation of the empire of Chinggis Khan, and the impact of these changes on each of its separate regions as recorded in the available primary sources. The keynote speech by Akinobu Kuroda (The University of Tokyo) was entitled “A Global Monetary History of Mongol Eurasia: A Mesoscopic Perspective”. The first panel “Networks of the Empire and Beyond” included the following talks: Yoichi Isahaya (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem), “Hulaguid Appanages as Mesoscale Agency in Cross-Cultural Exchange”; Elizabeth Lambourn (De Montfort University), “Mongol Eurasia at Sea: Peninsular South India in Networks of Maritime Trade and Tribute (Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries) ”.

5000|$|In early 1992 the war {{spread to}} {{neighboring}} Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the Croatian government helped arm the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), the main Croat army, and the Bosniak Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). The Defence Ministry established logistics centers for sending men, weapons and ammunition to the ARBiH. HV units were deployed in Bosnian Posavina {{and participated in}} Operation Jackal against the VRS. In 18 November 1991 the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia was established as an <b>autonomous</b> Croat <b>territorial</b> <b>unit.</b> Šušak {{was one of the}} chief supporters of Herzeg-Bosnia in the government and according to historian Marko Attila Hoare acted as a [...] "conduit" [...] of Croatian support for Bosnian Croat separatism. Relations between Croats and Bosniaks worsened by the end of 1992, resulting in the Croat-Bosniak War. During the war, HV units were deployed on the frontlines against the VRS in eastern Herzegovina. Volunteers with origins from Herzeg-Bosnia were sent by the Defence Ministry to the HVO, the official military formation of Herzeg-Bosnia. At its peak the amount of money from Croatia that funded the HVO surpassed $500,000 per day. Šušak supported the Vance-Owen plan that would establish 10 ethnically based provinces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He worked closely with EC representative David Owen, who adopted some of his proposals. On 18 March 1994 the US-brokered Washington Agreement was signed that ended the Croat-Bosniak conflict and created the Croat-Bosniak Federation.|$|R

40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on the impact of regulation of prostitution on budget income of selected <b>territorial</b> <b>units.</b> The current Proposal of the Act on Regulation of Prostitution and the Act on the Budget Determination of Taxes imply that <b>territorial</b> <b>units</b> should have be entitled especially to a share of the income tax revenue. The estimates of budget income suggest that the mostly affected <b>territorial</b> <b>units</b> should be entitled to the relatively largest share of income tax revenue. However, this rule is violated in case of less affected but large <b>territorial</b> <b>units.</b> This is because, according to the Act on the Budget Determination of Taxes, the income tax revenue is redistributed unproportionally from the most affected <b>territorial</b> <b>units</b> to the largests units. The estimated tax income from regulation of prostitution would be negligible part of the total income of all selected <b>territorial</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R
