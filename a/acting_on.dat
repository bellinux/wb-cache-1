5|$|In April 2007, <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> a {{recommendation}} {{made by the}} National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) during its investigation of Comair 5191, the FAA issued a safety notice that reiterated advice to pilots to positively confirm their position before crossing the hold-short line onto the take-off runway, and again when initiating takeoff. And in May, <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> another NTSB recommendation, the FAA advised that pilot training should include specific guidance on runway lighting requirements for take-off at night.|$|E

5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> gamete survival, and compatibility selection, <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> zygote formation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics {{is the notion that}} a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{some enzymes}} display enzyme promiscuity, having broad {{specificity}} and <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> {{a range of}} different physiologically relevant substrates. Many enzymes possess small side activities which arose fortuitously (i.e. neutrally), {{which may be the}} starting point for the evolutionary selection of a new function.|$|E

5|$|Feral zerg are zerg {{not under}} the control of any higher entity.

5|$|Free-body {{diagrams}} {{can be used}} as {{a convenient}} way to keep track of forces <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> a system. Ideally, these diagrams are drawn with the angles and relative magnitudes of the force vectors preserved so that graphical vector addition can be done to determine the net force.|$|E

5|$|It {{has never}} been fully {{explained}} what motivated the attack: the gunmen {{claimed to have been}} <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> their own initiative, and despite abundant conspiracy theories, no convincing evidence surfaced to suggest that any political leader or party was behind the attack. Nevertheless, the killings left a leadership void in the political establishment. Conspiracy theories immediately flourished that the gunmen had been <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> orders to sabotage a Karabakh peace deal, but a decade on, the available evidence still pointed to the leading gunman being a loner with a grudge against the Armenian political elite.|$|E

5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E

5|$|Tapping felt <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> the {{new show}} {{went a little}} easier when filming Carter scenes with Bill Dow ("Bill Lee"), {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} worked on Stargate SG-1.

Tapping's hair was longer than it was during her time on SG-1, and the military approved of the change {{as long as it was}} worn up. To save money on visual effects, the crew built set pieces to represent some of the buildings on M7R-227 and placed them in front of the puddle jumper set. Another measure taken as a substitute to visual effects was to cast mime artists as the frozen Asurans.|$|E
