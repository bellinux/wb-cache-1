The Series II update featured {{the addition of}} a new rear cross member, revised rear control arm assemblies with new style bushing and toe-control links to the semi-trailing arm rear suspension to better maintain the toe settings during suspension movements, resulting in more predictable car handling, noticeably over uneven surfaces, and improved tyre wear.|$|E
50|$|With an offset {{slider-crank}} mechanism, an {{offset distance}} is introduced. This offset distance {{is referred to}} as L1 and is the fixed distance between the crank <b>arm</b> <b>pivot</b> point and the slider axis. This offset distance means that the slider-crank motion is no longer symmetrical about the sliding axis. In addition, the required crank angles of the forward and reverse strokes are no longer equivalent. An offset slider-crank provides a quick return when a slower working stroke is desired.|$|E

5000|$|These {{were simple}} engines {{compared}} to modern engine design. However, they incorporate some very clever designs in several areas, many times because the designer {{was attempting to}} circumvent infringing a patent for a particular part of the engine. This is particularly true {{in the area of}} the governor. Governors are centrifugal, swinging <b>arm,</b> <b>pivot</b> arm, and many others. The actuator mechanism to govern speed is also varied depending on patents existing and the governor used. See, for example, U.S. Patents 543,157 from 1895 or 980,658 from 1911. However accomplished, the governor has one job - to control the speed of the engine. In modern engines, power output is controlled by throttling the flow of the air through the intake by means of a butterfly valve; the only exception to this being in diesels and Valvetronic petrol engines.|$|E
50|$|When {{the stroke}} of a {{mechanism}} needs to be calculated, first identify the ground level for the specified slider-crank mechanism. This ground level is the axis on which both the crank arm pivot-point and the slider pin are positioned. Draw the crank <b>arm</b> <b>pivot</b> point anywhere on this ground level. Once the pin positions are correctly placed, set a graphical compass to the given link length of the crank arm. Positioning the compass point on the pivot point of the crank arm, rotate the compass to produce a circle with radius equal {{to the length of}} the crank arm. This newly drawn circle represents the potential motion of the crank arm. Next, draw two models of the mechanism. These models will be oriented in a way that displays both the extreme positions of the slider. Once both diagrams are drawn, the linear distance between the retracted slider and the extended slider can be easily measured to determine the slider-crank stroke.|$|E

5000|$|Magnetoresistance {{float level}} sensors {{are similar to}} float level sensors however a {{permanent}} magnet pair is sealed inside the float <b>arm</b> <b>pivot.</b> As the float moves up the motion and location are transmitted as the angular position of the magnetic field. This detection system is highly accurate down to 0.02° of motion. The field compass location provides a physical location of the float position. The choice of float and stem materials depends on the liquid in terms of chemical compatibility as well as specific gravity and other factors that affect buoyancy of the float. The electronic monitoring system does not {{come in contact with}} the fluid and is considered Intrinsic safety: or explosion proof. These sensors work well for liquid level measurements in marine, vehicle, aviation, chemical processing, pharmaceuticals, food processing, waste treatment, and other applications. [...] Due to the presence of a microprocessor and low power consumption, there is also capability for serial communication from to other computing devices making this a good technique for adjusting calibration and filtering of the sensor signal.|$|E
5000|$|Styled by John Mockett, {{who later}} {{went on to}} design the Triumph Rocket III, the Hesketh V1000 was {{conceived}} as a luxury sports machine that could save the British motorcycle industry. [...] The engine was specially developed by Weslake as an air-cooled 90° V-twin with 95 mm bore and 70 mm stroke, giving a displacement of 992 cc. With a one piece cast crankshaft and aluminium jackets on iron cylinder barrels and alloy cylinder heads, the V1000 had four valves per cylinder and an overhead camshaft. The V1000 had electronic ignition and a Lucas alternator and starter motor. Lubrication was semi wet-sump [...] and the gearbox was a five-speed constant mesh to a sealed roller chain final drive. Front suspension includes custom yokes machined from solid alloy billets, and conventional rear suspension is provided by twin Marzocchi shocks. [...] The chain drive sprocket was coaxial with the swinging <b>arm</b> <b>pivot,</b> an arrangement to keep the drive chain tension constant, irrespective of {{the movement of the}} swinging arm. The alloy wheels, anodised either gold or black, were neither forged nor cast, but were made up from two sheet alloy pressings, riveted together. The frame was available either painted black or nickel-plated. Subsequently, the V1000 received several updates to address early problems, including digital engine management, and modification to suspension, brakes, wheels, engine and gearbox.|$|E
5000|$|The first commercially {{successful}} vibrato arm was the Bigsby vibrato tailpiece, {{most often}} just called a Bigsby, and invented by Paul Bigsby (US Patent D169120 filed in 1952, issued in 1953). The exact date {{of its first}} availability is uncertain, as Bigsby kept few records, but it was on Bigsby-built guitars photographed in 1952, in what became its standard form. In several interviews, the late Merle Travis, for whom Bigsby designed his first vibrato, recalled the prototype as being built {{for him in the}} [...] "late '40s". The design uses a spring-loaded arm that rotates a cylindrical bar in the tailpiece, varying the string tension to create vibrato and other pitch variations. The string tension is balanced against a single, short helical compression spring, positioned under the <b>arm</b> <b>pivot.</b> The spring on the original tailpiece for Merle Travis was a Harley Davidson valve spring, as this was the only one Bigsby could find that would return to tolerance (and pitch). When a young cash-strapped John Lennon lost the spring in his Bigsby, he got a flesh-colored replacement from someone who worked on artificial limbs. Pioneering blues-rock guitarist Lonnie Mack was known for using a Bigsby on his famous 1958 Gibson Flying V. The term whammy bar is believed to derive from Mack's 1963 instrumental hit, [...] "Wham!", in which Mack made liberal use of the Bigsby.|$|E
50|$|Needle {{bearings}} {{are heavily}} used in automobile components such as rocker <b>arm</b> <b>pivots,</b> pumps, compressors, and transmissions. The drive shaft of a rear-wheel drive vehicle typically {{has at least}} eight needle bearings (four in each U joint) and often more if it is particularly long, or operates on steep slopes.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1993, all GL1500 rocker <b>arms</b> <b>pivoted</b> on needle bearings, and {{the cruise}} control was updated to {{directly}} read crankshaft speed for enhanced precision; the GL1500 '93 cost $12,400. 1994 was the seventh year of GL1500 production (longer {{than any of}} its forerunners) and nothing significant changed except the asking price: GL1500A '94, $13,000.|$|R

5000|$|Even on a {{perfectly}} flat LP, tonearms {{are prone to}} two types of tracking errors that affect the sound. As the tonearm tracks the groove, the stylus exerts a frictional force tangent to the arc of the groove, and since this force does not intersect the tone <b>arm</b> <b>pivot,</b> a clockwise rotational force (moment) occurs and a reaction skating force is exerted on the stylus by the record groove wall away from center of the disc. Modern arms provide an anti-skate mechanism, using springs, hanging weights, or magnets to produce an offsetting counter-clockwise force at the pivot, making the net lateral force on the groove walls near zero. The second error occurs as the arm sweeps in an arc across the disc, causing the angle between the cartridge head and groove to change slightly. A change in angle, albeit small, will have a detrimental effect (especially with stereo recordings) by creating different forces on the two groove walls, {{as well as a}} slight timing shift between left/right channels. Making the arm longer to reduce this angle is a partial solution, but less than ideal. A longer arm weighs more, and only an infinitely long pivoted arm would reduce the error to zero. Some designs (Burne-Jones, and Garrard [...] "Zero" [...] series) use dual arms in a parallelogram arrangement, pivoting the cartridge head to maintain a constant angle as it moves across the record. Unfortunately this [...] "solution" [...] creates more problems than it solves, compromising rigidity and creating sources of unwanted noise.|$|E
5000|$|Ford {{celebrated the}} Mustang's 20th Anniversary in 1984 by issuing a limited-edition GT model under the {{designation}} GT-350. The GT-350 name {{had not been}} used since the last Shelby Mustang was produced in 1970. The GT-350 could be ordered in either a hatchback or convertible body style driven by either the high-performance 302cid V8 or the 140cid Turbo four. All came in white with special stripes and lettering while inside, SVO style seats were {{a feature of the}} all red interior. The 1984 20th anniversary edition GT sported a whole new look for Mustang, including the white monochromatic paint scheme and bold [...] "GT-350" [...] Striping. These Stripes are very reminiscent of the classic Shelby Mustangs Produced in the 1960s.One big mechanical revision for the Anniversary Mustang involved the GT's suspension. This revision was introduced as a running change early in 1984 to ALL GT Mustangs. The rear control <b>arm</b> <b>pivot</b> points were lowered 1/2-inch on the upper end and 1/4-inch on the lower end for improved suspension geometry. In addition, quad shocks replaced the old-style traction bars and the rear anti-roll bar diameter increased to 0.79 in compared to 0.67 in in 1983.Another newcomer in 1984 was the introduction of an Automatic Over Drive (AOD) Transmission. This combination could only be purchased with a 302 utilizing a Throttle Body Fuel Injection (TBI) system, also called Central Fuel Injection(CFI). The optional 165 horsepower (123 kW) 5.0L engine with CFI and the 4-speed AOD transmission package was offered with a 3.27:1 axle ratio. The [...] 4V version carried over from 1983 was available only with a T-5 manual transmission. The 4V 5-speed was available with a 3.08:1 axle ratio. The 20th Anniversary Edition GT350's were produced during 35 days of production. The entire production {{is believed to have been}} done in 35 batches starting March 5, 1984 and ending in April 1984, there was one final Anniversary Mustang Convertible (TBI/CFI Automatic) Produced on June 12, 1984.|$|E
5000|$|When in motion, the arm swings {{until it}} makes a {{complete}} loop; however, the riders never become inverted (upside-down).

5000|$|The Weissach axle is {{a variant}} of the {{semi-trailing}} arm suspension. The tendency of a vehicle to oversteer when decelerating is compounded by the compliant bushings found in most trailing arm suspensions. When the vehicle is decelerating, the trailing <b>arm</b> <b>pivots</b> towards the rear as the wheel is [...] "pulled" [...] backwards relative to the chassis. This results in toe out, which makes the vehicle unstable.|$|R
2500|$|The {{caliper brake}} is {{a class of}} cable-actuated brake in which the brake mounts to a single point above the wheel, {{theoretically}} allowing the arms to auto-centre on the rim. [...] Arms extend around the tyre and end in brake shoes that press against the rim. [...] While some designs incorporate dual pivot points [...] the <b>arms</b> <b>pivot</b> on a sub-frame [...] the entire assembly still mounts to a single point.|$|R
25|$|The older, {{traditional}} {{pattern has}} two <b>arms</b> that <b>pivot,</b> {{and one that}} slides to accommodate varying sizes of drum.

The output of the interrupter is fed to an induction coil which greatly increases the voltage applied to the patient by transformer action.|$|R
50|$|The {{cantilever}} brake is a {{class of}} brake in which each arm {{is attached to a}} separate pivot point {{on one side of the}} seat stay or fork. Thus all cantilever brakes are dual-pivot. Both first- and second-class lever designs exist; second-class is by far the most common. In the second-class lever design, the <b>arm</b> <b>pivots</b> below the rim. The brake shoe is mounted above the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are drawn together. In the first-class lever design, the <b>arm</b> <b>pivots</b> above the rim. The brake shoe is mounted below the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are forced apart.Due to a wider possible distance between the mounts and pads, cantilever brakes are often preferred for bicycles that use wide tyres, such as on mountain bikes. Because the arms move only in their designed arcs, the brake shoe must be adjustable in several planes. Thus cantilever brake shoes are notoriously difficult to adjust. As the brake shoes of a second-class cantilever brake wears, they ride lower on the rim. Eventually, one may go underneath the rim, so that the brake does not function.|$|R

5000|$|The {{semaphore}} arm {{consists of two}} parts: A wooden or metal arm (or [...] "blade") which pivots at different angles, and a spectacle holding coloured lenses which move {{in front of a}} lamp in order to provide indications at night. Usually these were combined into a single frame, though in some types (e.g. [...] "somersault" [...] signals in which the <b>arm</b> <b>pivoted</b> in the centre), the arm was separate from the spectacle. The arm projects horizontally in its most restrictive aspect; other angles indicate less restrictive aspects.|$|R
2500|$|... "U-brakes" [...] (also {{known by}} the trademarked term [...] "990-style") are {{essentially}} the same design as the centre-pull caliper brake. [...] The {{difference is that the}} two <b>arm</b> <b>pivots</b> attach directly to the frame or fork while those of the centre-pull caliper brake attach to an integral bridge frame that mounts to the frame or fork by a single bolt. [...] Like roller cam brakes, this is a caliper design with pivots located above the rim. [...] Thus U-brakes are often interchangeable with, and have the same maintenance issues as, roller cam brakes.|$|R
5000|$|A wiper {{generally}} {{consists of}} a metal <b>arm,</b> <b>pivoting</b> {{at one end and}} with a long rubber blade attached to the other. The arm is powered by a motor, often an electric motor, although pneumatic power is also used in some vehicles. The blade is swung {{back and forth over the}} glass, pushing water or other precipitation from its surface. The speed is normally adjustable, with several continuous speeds and often one or more [...] "intermittent" [...] settings. Most automobiles use two synchronized radial type arms, while many commercial vehicles use one or more pantograph arms.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pivoted</b> <b>arm</b> {{produces}} {{yet another}} problem which {{is unlikely to}} be significant to the audiophile, though. As the master was originally cut in a linear motion from the edge towards the center, but the stylus on the <b>pivoted</b> <b>arm</b> always draws an arc, this causes a timing drift that is most significant when digitizing music and beat mapping the data for synchronization with other songs in a DAW or DJ software unless the software allows building a non-linear beat map. As the contact point of the stylus on the record wanders farther from the linear path between the starting point and center hole, the tempo and pitch tend to decrease towards the middle of the record, until the arc reaches its apex. After that the tempo and pitch increase towards the end as the contact point comes closer to the linear path again. Because the surface speed of the record is lower at the end, the relative speed error from the same absolute distance error is higher at the end, and the increase in tempo is more notable towards the end than the decrease towards the middle. This can be somewhat reduced by a curved <b>arm</b> <b>pivoted</b> so that the end point of the arc stays farther from the linear path than the starting point, or by a long straight <b>arm</b> that <b>pivots</b> perpendicularly to the linear path {{in the middle of the}} record. However the tempo droop at the middle can only be completely avoided by a linear tracking arm.|$|R

50|$|Dubonnet {{suspension}} was {{a system}} of trailing arm independent front suspension and steering popular mainly in the 1930s and 1940s. Not very durable unless exactingly maintained, it was soon replaced by other versions. It consisted of a rigidly mounted axle beam in which the sprung steering and suspension <b>arms</b> <b>pivoted</b> around kingpins mounted {{on the ends of}} the axle. The wheels themselves were mounted onto stub axles, suspended from the kingpins. The system featured an encased coil spring and shock absorber, which sealed in the oil needed to lubricate and protect the suspension parts. This was also the weakness of the layout, as any leaks would have negative effects on ride and durability.|$|R
