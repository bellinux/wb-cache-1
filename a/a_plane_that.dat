5|$|The {{extension}} of Apollonius' problem to three dimensions, namely, {{the problem of}} finding a fifth sphere that is tangent to four given spheres, can be solved by analogous methods. For example, the given and solution spheres can be resized so that one given sphere is shrunk to point while maintaining tangency. Inversion in this point reduces Apollonius' problem to finding <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>that</b> is tangent to three given spheres. There are in general eight such planes, which become the solutions to the original problem by reversing the inversion and the resizing. This problem was first considered by Pierre de Fermat, and many alternative solution methods have been developed over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|Angie takes {{a job at}} the {{catering}} {{company of}} her neighbor, Bree Hodge (Marcia Cross), and a friendship develops. Later, Angie learns that Nick had an affair with Julie prior to her attack, but she forgives him for this betrayal. When Julie rejects Danny once more, he attempts suicide by swallowing a large amount of pills. Angie and Nick admit him to the hospital, where he awakens with temporary memory loss and tells Nurse Mona Clark (Maria Cominis), that his name is Tyler. Mona assumes that the family is in the witness relocation program, but Danny fully reveals his family's secret. Mona demands $67,000 from the Bolens in return for her silence but is killed by <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>that</b> makes an emergency landing on Wisteria Lane soon after.|$|E

If the tetrahedron's altitudes do intersect, then the Monge point and the orthocenter coincide to give the class of orthocentric tetrahedron.|$|E

40|$|Network {{services}} must self-adapt dynamically {{in order}} to accommodate available resources, system errors, and changing requirements. This need for self-reliance will increase with the growing flexibility and heterogeneity that characterizes such network technologies as sensor (ad hoc) networking, grid computing, and pervasive computing. The downside of traditional distributed network management techniques is that they do {{not take into account the}} design of each individual network node. We propose a bottom-up approach, i. e. providing a solid and adaptable architecture at the core of each network node, and on top of it a coordination and management platform that exploits the underlying flexibility. This paper proposes a node-architecture for decentralized cooperative management, structured as three clearly separated planes: (1) <b>a</b> communication <b>plane</b> <b>that</b> is designed with adaptability in mind, (2) <b>a</b> coordination <b>plane</b> <b>that</b> enables individual nodes to cooperate, and (3) <b>a</b> management <b>plane</b> <b>that</b> monitors the communication plane and adapts it when necessary. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|A special type of integrator, used at a {{point where}} only {{moderate}} accuracy was needed, was based on a steel ball, instead of a disc. It had two inputs, one to rotate the ball, and the other to define the angle of the ball's rotating axis. That axis was always in <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>that</b> contained the axes of two movement-pickoff rollers, quite similar to the mechanism of a rolling-ball computer mouse (in this mechanism, the pickoff rollers were roughly the same diameter as the ball). The pickoff roller axes were at right angles.|$|E
25|$|Although tilt {{and swing}} are {{normally}} used {{to maximize the}} part of the image that is within the DOF, they also can be used, in combination with a small f-number, to give selective focus to <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>that</b> isn't perpendicular to the lens axis. With this technique, it is possible to have objects at greatly different distances from the camera in sharp focus and yet have a very shallow DOF. The effect can be interesting because it differs from what most viewers are accustomed to seeing.|$|E
25|$|During the Texas {{redistricting}} warrant controversy, several Democratic {{members of}} the Texas House of Representatives went to Oklahoma to prevent the House from establishing a quorum of members, thereby preventing the House from acting on any legislation, including a proposed redistricting plan.

DeLay's staff contacted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for assistance in tracking down <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>that</b> one of the legislators was flying to Oklahoma, an action that the FAA believed to be a result of safety concerns about the aircraft. A review by the U.S. Department of Transportation found that a total of thirteen FAA employees spent more than eight hours searching for the airplane.|$|E
