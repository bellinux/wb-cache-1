60|$|ERNEST. It is true. Yes: {{there is}} no use your tossing your head in that petulant manner. It is quite true. In the best days of art there were no art-critics. The {{sculptor}} hewed from the marble block the great white-limbed Hermes that slept within it. The waxers and gilders of images gave tone and texture to the statue, and the world, when it saw it, worshipped and was dumb. He poured the glowing bronze into the mould of sand, and the river of red metal cooled into noble curves and took the impress {{of the body of}} a god. With enamel or polished jewels he gave sight to the sightless eyes. The hyacinth-like curls grew crisp beneath his graver. And when, in some dim frescoed fane, or pillared sunlit portico, the child of Leto stood upon his pedestal, those who passed by, [Greek text which cannot be reproduced], became conscious of a new influence that had come across their lives, and dreamily, or with a sense of strange and quickening joy, went to their homes or daily labour, or wandered, it may be, through the city gates to that nymph-haunted meadow where young Phaedrus bathed his feet, and, lying there on the soft grass, beneath the tall wind--whispering planes and flowering <b>agnus</b> <b>castus,</b> began to think of the wonder of beauty, and grew silent with unaccustomed awe. In those days the artist was free. From the river valley he took the fine clay in his fingers, and with a little tool of wood or bone, fashioned it into forms so exquisite that the people gave them to the dead as their playthings, and we find them still in the dusty tombs on the yellow hillside by Tanagra, with the faint gold and the fading crimson still lingering about hair and lips and raiment. On a wall of fresh plaster, stained with bright sandyx or mixed with milk and saffron, he pictured one who trod with tired feet the purple white-starred fields of asphodel, one 'in whose eyelids lay the whole of the Trojan War,' Polyxena, the daughter of Priam; or figured Odysseus, the wise and cunning, bound by tight cords to the mast-step, that he might listen without hurt to the singing of the Sirens, or wandering by the clear river of Acheron, where the ghosts of fishes flitted over the pebbly bed; or showed the Persian in trews and mitre flying before the Greek at Marathon, or the galleys clashing their beaks of brass in the little Salaminian bay. He drew with silver-point and charcoal upon parchment and prepared cedar. Upon ivory and rose-coloured terracotta he painted with wax, making the wax fluid with juice of olives, and with heated irons making it firm. Panel and marble and linen canvas became wonderful as his brush swept across them; and life seeing her own image, was still, and dared not speak. All life, indeed, was his, from the merchants seated in the market-place to the cloaked shepherd lying on the hill; from the nymph hidden in the laurels and the faun that pipes at noon, to the king whom, in long green- curtained litter, slaves bore upon oil-bright shoulders, and fanned with peacock fans. Men and women, with pleasure or sorrow in their faces, passed before him. He watched them, and their secret became his. Through form and colour he re-created a world.|$|E
50|$|Agni casti fructus (ripe, dried fruits) is a {{pharmaceutical}} drug {{made out of}} Vitex agnus-castus. Albania and Morocco are the main export countries. The fruits are wildly collected (wild grafting). There are three other types of drugs of Vitex agnus-castus fruits: Vitex agnus-castus hom. HAB1 (ripe, dried fruits), <b>Agnus</b> <b>castus</b> hom PFX (dried fruits) and <b>Agnus</b> <b>castus</b> hom. HPUS88 (fruits). The smell of ground fruits is aromatic, sage-like whereas the taste is spicy, pepper-like. The drug Vitex agnus-castus hom. HAB1 is a round, up to 5 mm big, red-brown to dark fruit. In the middle it is often yellow. It contains 4 fruit compartments with one seed per compartment. A minimum of 0.4% of essential oil is required. Viticis folium (dried leaves) is another drug which is produced from Vitex agnus-castus. The whole drug consists of lanceolate leaves with tomentose under and hairless upper sides.|$|E

50|$|Thysanoptera, {{also known}} as thrips, can cause great damage to the growth and the {{generative}} development of Vitex agnus-castus. The insect feeds on chaste tree by sucking up the contents or puncturing them. As well chaste tree is the only known host (especially in Israel) for the bug insect called Hyalesthus obsoletus. This cicada is the vector for black wood disease of grapevines. Hyalesthus obsoletus prefers V. agnus-castus more as a host than the grapevine. In this case chaste tree {{can be used as}} a biological control agent by planting it around vineyards to trap the Hyalesthus obsoletus.V. agnus-castus was found not only to be an appropriate food source for the adult vectors, but also a reservoir of Candidatus Phytoplasma solani (bacterial Phytoplasma species), the casual agent of the Black wood disease in grapevines. The pathogen-caused leaf spot disease can almost defoliate V. <b>agnus</b> <b>castus.</b> Furthermore root rot can occur, when soils are kept too moist.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} of action is not fully understood but {{it is assumed that}} it has dopaminergic effects resulting in changes of prolactin secretion. At low doses, such as might have been used in previous centuries for suppression of sexual desire, it inhibits activation of dopamine 2 receptor by competitive binding, causing a slight increase in release of prolactin. In higher concentrations, as in modern extracts, the binding activity is sufficient to reduce the release of prolactin. A study has found that treatment of 20 healthy men with higher doses of Vitex agnus-castus was associated with a slight reduction of prolactin levels, whereas lower doses caused a slight increase as compared to doses of placebo. [...] A decrease of prolactin will influence levels of Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estrogen in women and testosterone in men [...] Dopaminergic compounds (diterpenes with prolactin-suppressive effects that were almost identical in their prolactin-suppressive properties to dopamine itself) present in Vitex <b>agnus</b> <b>castus</b> seem likely to be the clinically important compounds which improve premenstrual mastodynia and possibly also psycho-somatic symptoms of PMS.|$|E
5000|$|In {{ancient times}} it was {{believed}} to be an anaphrodisiac, hence the name chaste tree. Pliny, in his Historia Naturalis, reports the use of stems and leaves of this plant by women as bedding [...] "to cool the heat of lust" [...] {{during the time of the}} Thesmophoria, when Athenian women left their husbands' beds to remain ritually chaste. At the end of the thirteenth century John Trevisa reports of it [...] "the herbe agnus-castus is always grene, and the flowre therof is namly callyd <b>Agnus</b> <b>Castus,</b> for wyth smel and vse it maketh men chaste as a lombe". [...] Chaucer, in [...] "The Flower and the Leaf," [...] refers to it as an attribute of the chaste Diana, and in the 16th century the English herbalist William Turner reports the same anaphrodisiac properties of the seed, both fried and not fried. More recently, this plant has been called monk's pepper in the thought that it was used as anti-libido medicine by monks to aid their attempts to remain chaste. There are disputed accounts regarding its actual action on libido, with some claims that it is anaphrodisiac and others that it is aphrodisiac. Because of the complex mechanism of action it can be probably both, depending on concentration of the extract and physiologic variables (see below).|$|E

Material and Methods: In a double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial, 64 women with long bone fracture, 20 - 45 years old, were randomly allocated to receive 1) one Agnugol tablet (4 mg dried fruit extract of vitex <b>agnus</b> <b>castus)</b> plus 250 mg magnesium oxide (VAC + Mg group (n = 10)), 2) one Agnugol tablet plus placebo (VAC group (n = 15)), 3) placebo plus 250 mg magnesium oxide (Mg group (n = 12)), or 4) placebo plus placebo (placebo group (n = 14)) per day for 8 weeks. At baseline and endpoint of the trial, serum alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured together with radiological bone assessment. Results: There were no significant differences in the characteristic aspects of concern between the four groups at baseline. Despite the increased level of alkaline phosphatase in the VAC group (188. 33 ± 16. 27 to 240. 40 ± 21. 49, P = 0. 05), administration of VAC + Mg could not increase alkaline phosphatase activity. However, treatment with VAC + Mg significantly enhanced the osteocalcin level. The serum concentration of VEGF was increased in the VAC group (269. 04 ± 116. 63 to 640. 03 ± 240. 16, P < 0. 05). Callus formation in the VAC + Mg group was higher than the other groups but the differences between the four groups were not significant (P = 0. 39). No relevant side effect was observed in patients in each group. Conclusion : Our results suggest that administration of vitex <b>agnus</b> <b>castus</b> plus magnesium may promote fracture healing.

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction & Objective: Vitex <b>agnus</b> <b>castus</b> (Verbenaceae) is a phytoestrogeic herb {{native to}} the Middle East and {{southern}} Europe. It has clinical usage in so many countries. In this research, the effects of Vitex <b>agnus</b> <b>castus</b> extract was investigated on spermatogenesis of male Balb/C mice. Materials & Methods: This is an experimental study in which adult male mice were chosen and divided into 3 groups: control, vehicle, and experimental. Animals were daily injected (i. p.) with 65, 165 265, 365, and 465 mg/kg of seed extract for ten consecutive days. Then the animals were weighed and eventually killed by cervical dislocation 2 weeks after the last injection. The caudal part of the right epididymis was used for sperm counting. After macroscopic investigation (weight, diameter and volume of testes) tissues were fixed in Buin's fixative. Tissues were cut at 5 µm, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H& E). Ccollected data was analyzed by the SPSS software by using one-way ANOVA. Results: No significant differences in body weight, volume, weight and diameter of testes was seen. Light microscopic studies showed {{a significant reduction in}} germinal epithelium in doses of 265 and 365 mg/kg and increased of interstitial tissue area in doses of 265, 365, and 465 mg/kg of extract. There {{was no significant difference in}} epithelium thickness and of the diameter of the epididymis. Germinal cells contained pyknotic nuclei and several holes that were found scattered in the tubules. Testis also showed a general disarrangement in various germinal elements of seminiferous tubules.

40|$|Today {{treatment}} of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is still debatable and requires an individual differentiated approach. The objective of {{research was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of differentiated {{treatment of}} PMS various forms. Material and methods. The study involved 200 women of reproductive age with diagnosis of PMS. Combined estrogen-progestagen drugs with drospirenone, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, Vitex <b>agnus</b> <b>castus</b> extract or traditional treatment were prescribed according to the form and severity of disease. Results of the research. Traditional therapy was quite effective for correction of psychological and somatic symptoms in patients with mild neuropsychic and edematous forms of PMS. However, it was not effective enough in the patients with severe PMS and persons with cephalgic and crisis forms. Differentiated treatment of neuropsychical and edematous forms with combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone and the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in patients with cephalgic and crisis forms of PMS significantly helped to reduce the intensity and leveling of symptoms compared with traditional therapy. Herbal medicines with Vitex <b>agnus</b> <b>castus</b> were effective for correction of symptoms in women with mild neuropsychical form. Conclusions. Treatment of patients with PMS should be individual and differentiated and depend on the clinical form and severity of the disease. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{dried fruits}} of the chaste tree Vitex <b>agnus</b> <b>castus</b> (VAC) were {{traditionally}} used by monks {{as a substitute for}} pepper and was therefore also called Monk’s pepper. For the last 50  years it is commercially provided for the treatment of premenstrual symptoms, particularly to prevent premenstrual mastodynia (mastalgia). Most studies were performed with the preparation containing an aqueous/ethanolic ectract BNO 1095. A number of placebo controlled studies gave proof that extracts of VAC had beneficial effects on premenstrual breast pain. This breast sensation is induced by latent hyperprolactinemia which is characterized by secretory episodes of prolactin release by the pituitary in response to stress and deep sleep phases. This latent hyperprolactinemia induces also often a corpus luteum insufficiency which is a common reason for infertilty.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of experimental assays to study properties of herbal medicine is worthwhile. Vitex <b>agnus</b> <b>castus</b> (VAC) is utilized in popular medicine and some actions {{have been attributed}} to its extract. Blood cells (BC) and plasma proteins are labeled with technetium- 99 m (Tc- 99 m) and have been used in nuclear medicine, as in basic research. This procedure uses a reducing agent and stannous ion is utilized. There are reports that drugs can alter this labeling process. The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of an aqueous extract of VAC on the labeling of blood constituents with Tc- 99 m. Blood was incubated with VAC, stannous chloride and Tc- 99 m, as sodium pertechnetate, and centrifuged.

40|$|Abstract- Vitex <b>agnus</b> <b>castus</b> (chasteberry) is {{a popular}} {{treatment}} {{for the management of}} female reproductive disorders including corpus luteum insufficiency, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), menopausal symptoms, and insufficient milk production. According to developing situation of complementary medicine, and frequent use of this herb, it is important to examine its effects during pregnancy. In this research we studied its effects on mice development, and we focused on macroscopic parameters, such as CRL (Crown-Rump length) and the weight of embryos, and diameter and the weight of placenta, and microscopic parameters such as the diameters of eye and lens of embryos. We found that Vitex has special effects during different stages of mice development, for example it can improve the growth of embryos in 8 th and 9 th day of pregnancy (it causes significant increase in CRL and weight of embryos). Also, it may changes some microscopic parameters. These founding suggest that it should be used more cautiously during pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|The diffuse benign breast disease {{mastopathy}} is {{most common}} in reproductive-aged women. According to the World Health Organization, mastopathy {{is defined as a}} fibrocystic disease (FCD) characterized by a broad spectrum of proliferative and regressive changes in breast tissues. The prevalence of this disease varies from 30 to 40 %. The magnitude of clinical manifestations is highly diverse varying from slight premenstrual tension to the acute pain syndrome accompanied by the higher volume and density of the gland with the formation of nodular proliferations and cysts. In most cases, the present women regard mastopathy as a handicap in daily life and try to resort to sparing therapy options, such as homeopathy or phytotherapy. The phytotherapeutic preparation Mastodinon is one of these pathogenetic effective drugs to treat premenstrual syndrome and FCD. The major active principle is <b>Agnus</b> <b>castus</b> (leban, chaste tree). The clinical efficacy of mastodinon may be judged from the results {{of a large number of}} the studies given in this paper. </p...|$|E
