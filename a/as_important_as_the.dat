5|$|The Sruti and Smriti {{texts of}} Hinduism are an {{important}} historical framework of the Shaktism tradition. In addition, it reveres the texts Devi Mahatmya, the Devi-Bhagavata Purana, and Shakta Upanishads such as the Devi Upanishad. The Devi Mahatmya in particular, is considered in Shaktism to be <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
5|$|In acute liver failure, the {{development}} of severe encephalopathy strongly predicts short-term mortality, and is almost <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> nature of the underlying cause of the liver failure in determining the prognosis. Historically, widely used criteria for offering liver transplantation, such as King's College Criteria, are of limited use and recent guidelines discourage excessive reliance on these criteria. The occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in people with Wilson's disease (hereditary copper accumulation) and mushroom poisoning indicates an urgent need for a liver transplant.|$|E
5|$|The 10-minute {{murder scene}} which forms the film's climax is scored with almost {{the whole of}} the Act II duet between Otello and Iago from Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. This is an {{atypical}} scoring for a film, since Verdi's piece is not an aria, but a dramatic dialogue in which the words are <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> music. Thus the astute spectator will be presented with two dramatic narratives to follow; Allen is not respecting traditional conventions of cinematic accompaniment, since the score's events do not match the story unfolding onscreen.|$|E

5|$|The Devi Upanishad in its {{explanation}} of the theology of Shaktism, mentions and praises Shiva such as in its verse 19. Shiva, along with Vishnu, is a revered god in the Devi Mahatmya, a text of Shaktism considered by the tradition to be <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Bhagavad Gita. The Ardhanarisvara concept co-mingles god Shiva and goddess Shakti by presenting an icon that is half man and half woman, a representation and theme of union found in many Hindu texts and temples.|$|E
5|$|The topics the Drapier {{addresses}} span from absentee land {{owners to}} importing of goods from Britain to the favouring of Englishmen over Irishmen for Irish governmental positions. These issues were the many issues that Swift cared about and saw as threatening Ireland before Wood's halfpence controversy. However, these individual issues were not <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> independence and unity of Ireland: {{the specifics of}} independence were less important than self-rule. Some argue that Swift, after Wood's patent was withdrawn, removed himself from the political landscape to focus on writing Gulliver's Travels, in which he picked up {{many of the same}} ideas.|$|E
5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony can be <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> music, and the chorus and soloists can {{participate}} equally with the {{instruments in the}} exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, {{as in the case}} of Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, {{as in the case of}} Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E

5|$|Commercial sealing was {{historically}} just <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> whaling industry. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and {{all species}} of fur seal. The scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s, after the Canadian government reduced {{the length of}} the hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and northwest Africa, and only remains in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.|$|E
5|$|The polyptych was {{commissioned}} to provide both comfort and {{warning to the}} dying. It was intended to remind them of their faith, and direct their last thoughts towards the divine. This is evident in its positioning in the chapel, within view of the patients' beds. Rolin specified that 30 beds be placed {{within sight of the}} altarpiece for those too ill to walk, where it was visible to them through a pierced screen. There were usually only two patients per bed, luxurious at a time when six to fifteen in a large bed was more common. Medical care was expensive and primitive in the 15th century; the spiritual care of patients was <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> treatment of physical ailments.|$|E
5|$|He {{expressed}} {{surprise that}} a task <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> expedition's was entrusted to such young men. Von Hentig {{had to convince}} the Emir that the mission did not consider themselves merchants, but instead brought word from the Kaiser, the Ottoman Sultan, and from India, wishing to recognise Afghanistan's complete independence and sovereignty. The Kaiser's typewritten letter, which he compared to the handsome greeting received from the Ottomans, failed to settle the Emir's suspicions; he doubted its authenticity. Von Hentig's explanation that the Kaiser had written the letter using the only instrument available at his field headquarters before the group's hurried departure may not have entirely convinced him. Passing along the Kaiser's invitation to join the war {{on the side of}} the Central Powers, von Hentig described the war situation as favourable and invited the Emir to declare independence. This was followed by a presentation from Kasim Bey explaining the Ottoman Sultan's declaration of jihad and Turkey's desire to avoid a fratricidal war between Islamic peoples. He passed along a message to Afghanistan similar to the Kaiser's. Barkatullah invited Habibullah to declare war against the British Empire and to come to the aid of India's Muslims. He proposed that the Emir should allow Turco-German forces to cross Afghanistan for a campaign towards the Indian frontier, a campaign which he hoped the Emir would join. Barkatullah and Mahendra Pratap, both eloquent speakers, pointed out the rich territorial gains the Emir stood to acquire by joining the Central Powers.|$|E

5|$|Swedish {{heraldry}} has {{a number}} of characteristics that distinguish the Swedish style from heraldry in other European countries. Common features of Swedish heraldry {{are similar to those of}} other Nordic countries and Germany, placing it in the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, distinguished from Gallo-British heraldry and other heraldic traditions by several key elements of heraldic style. One of these is the use of multiple helmets and crests, which cannot be displayed separately from the main shield. These helmets and crests are considered to be <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> shield, each denoting a fief over which the bearer holds a right. In Scandinavia (as distinct from the German custom), when an even number of helmets is displayed, they are usually turned, with their crests, to face outward; when an odd number, the center helmet is turned affronté and the rest turned outward (whereas in Germany the helmets are turned inward to face the center of the escutcheon). Additionally, the crests are often repetitive of charges used on the main shield, and marks of cadency typically occur in the crest, rather than on the shield as in Gallo-British heraldry. Also, the use of heraldic furs on the shield, while common in Gallo-British heraldry, is rare in German-Nordic heraldry. Furs in Scandinavia are generally limited to ermine and vair, which sometimes appear in mantling, supporters, or the trimmings of crowns, but rarely on the shield.|$|E
5|$|The early Bhagavata {{writings}} in Sanskrit by well-known acharyas (gurus) were solely {{meant to}} have a proselytising effect on the masses, encouraging them to a theistic {{way of life and}} belief in the god Krishna. Chatu Vitthalanatha, who flourished as a court poet of King Krishnadeva Raya and his successor King Achyuta Raya, was the first to translate the Bhagavata into Kannada in a voluminous writing comprising 12,247 stanzas divided into 280 sections. The work covered the entire original version in shatpadi metre. Two other names appear in the colophons, Sadananda Yati and Nityatma Sukayogi, prompting some scholars to attribute the work to the group while others consider them alternate names of the same writer. The work covers all ten avatars of the god Vishnu, though it is essentially centred on the depiction of Krishna as the supreme Lord. The purana covers stories of Vishnu's famous devotees such as Prahlad and Dhruva in detail, as well as stories of demons Vritasura, Hiranyakashipu and others who sought to attain salvation by dying at the hands of Vishnu. Most noteworthy is the epic's influence on the compositions of the Haridasas. Though the writing is not considered <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> other two epics of the period, its significance to religiously minded people is well accepted. Chatu Vitthalanatha wrote a fuller version of portions of the epic Mahabharata as well. Other notable writers of the 16th century were Tirumala Bhatta (Siva Gite) and Ramendra (Saundarya Katharatna, using tripadi metre).|$|E
