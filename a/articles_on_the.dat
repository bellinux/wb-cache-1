5|$|While {{living in}} London Hogg made the {{acquaintance}} of several well-known writers, and he published literary works of his own. He studied Greek literature {{for much of}} his life and published several <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject, including two entries in the Encyclopædia Britannica. Most of the fiction he wrote was poorly reviewed. His best-known literary work was The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley, an unfinished biography of the poet. Although the book was well researched and painted a clear picture of Shelley as a young man, it was criticised for portraying him negatively.|$|E
5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} middle-class family in Vienna, List {{claimed that he}} {{abandoned}} his family's Roman Catholic faith in childhood, instead devoting himself to the pre-Christian god Wotan. Spending {{much time in the}} Austrian countryside, he engaged in rowing, hiking, and sketching the landscape. From 1877 he began a career as a journalist, primarily authoring <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Austrian countryside for nationalist newspapers and magazines. In these he placed a völkisch emphasis on the folk culture and customs of rural people, believing that many of them were survivals of pre-Christian, pagan religion. He published three novels, Carnuntum (1888), Jung Diethers Heimkehr (1894), and Pipara (1895), each set among the German tribes of the Iron Age, as well as authoring several plays. During the 1890s he continued writing völkisch articles, now largely for the nationalist Ostdeutsche Rundschau newspaper, with his works taking on an anti-semitic dimension halfway through that decade. In 1893, he co-founded the Literarische Donaugesellschaft literary society, and involved himself in Austria's Pan-German nationalist movement, a milieu which sought the integration of Austria into the German Empire.|$|E
5|$|By the Han dynasty, {{written law}} had matured from its archaic form {{based largely on}} natural law and social customs into a {{rational}} corpus influenced by politics and based on positive law. However, the Han dynasty law code established by Chancellor Xiao He (d. 193 BCE) was largely an extension of an existing Qin dynasty law code. Evidence for this includes archaeological finds at Qin-era Shuihudi and Han-era Zhangjiashan. The nine chapters of the law code consisted of statutes which dealt with criminality, while two of these chapters dealt with court procedure. Although it survives only in small fragments, it was allegedly a massive written work on 960 written scrolls. The code had 26,272 articles written in 7,732,200 words that outlined punishments. There were 490 <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> death penalty alone which contained 1,882 offenses and 3,472 analogies or pieces of case law.|$|E
