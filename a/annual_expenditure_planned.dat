Visitors are also to confirm their departure by having their visas or passports scanned and undergoing fingerscanning at selected air and sea ports of entry.

25|$|A {{month after}} taking office, Campbell-Bannerman called a general election, {{in which the}} Liberals gained a {{landslide}} majority of 132. However, Asquith's first budget, in 1906, was constrained by the <b>annual</b> income and <b>expenditure</b> <b>plans</b> he had inherited from his predecessor Austen Chamberlain. The only income for which Chamberlain had over-budgeted was the duty from sales of alcohol. With a balanced budget, and a realistic assessment of future public expenditure, Asquith was able, in his second and third budgets, to lay the foundations for limited redistribution of wealth and welfare provisions for the poor. Blocked at first by Treasury officials from setting a variable rate of income tax with higher rates on those with high incomes, {{he set up a}} committee under Sir Charles Dilke which recommended not only variable income tax rates but also a super-tax on incomes of more than £5,000 a year. Asquith also introduced a distinction between earned and unearned income, taxing the latter at a higher rate. He used the increased revenues to fund old-age pensions, the first time a British government had provided them. Reductions in selective taxes, such as that on sugar, were aimed at benefiting the poor.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the merits of}} the British budget management system that was inherited in Anglophone African countries and which has changed substantially in the United Kingdom since the 1960 s. It considers whether the disappointing budgetary performance in Africa is due to weaknesses in the inherited British system, other external influences, or domestic developments. It finds that all three factors {{have played a role in}} the widespread problems with budget management systems. Reforms in institutional arrangements are needed, especially in budget execution. Technical reforms will be ineffective unless there are concomitant changes to enhance accountability, improve governance, and increase compliance.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine incremental health care resource utilization, incremental health care expenditures, incremental absenteeism, and incremental absenteeism costs associated with Osteoarthritis. An observational database analysis was conducted using information from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Individuals 18 years of age or older and employed during 2011 were eligible for inclusion in the sample for analyses. Individuals were identified with Osteoarthritis diagnosis based on ICD- 9 -CM diagnosis codes. Out of a sample of 26, 992 individuals, 1, 354 were diagnosed with osteoarthritis. Individuals with osteoarthritis were compared to individuals without osteoarthritis. ^ Incremental health care resource utilization examined included annual hospitalization, annual hospital days, annual emergency room visits, annual outpatient visits. Incremental health <b>expenditures</b> examined included <b>annual</b> inpatient <b>expenditures,</b> <b>annual</b> outpatient <b>expenditures,</b> <b>annual</b> emergency room <b>expenditures,</b> <b>annual</b> miscellaneous <b>expenditures,</b> <b>annual</b> medication <b>expenditures</b> and <b>annual</b> total <b>expenditures.</b> Incremental resource utilization, incremental resource expenditures, incremental absenteeism and incremental absenteeism costs were estimated using regression models, adjusting for other covariates including age, gender, sex, region, marital status, insurance coverage, comorbidities, anxiety, asthma, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Multivariate regression models revealed incremental mean annual resource use associated with osteoarthritis of 0. 07 hospitalizations, equal to 70 additional hospitalizations per 100 osteoarthritic patients annually, and 3. 63 outpatient visits, equal to 363 additional visits per 100 osteoarthritic patients annually. Mean <b>annual</b> incremental total <b>expenditures</b> associated with osteoarthritis were $ 2, 046. Mean <b>annual</b> incremental <b>expenditures</b> were largest for inpatient expenditures at $ 826, followed by mean <b>annual</b> incremental outpatient <b>expenditures</b> of $ 659, and mean <b>annual</b> incremental medication <b>expenditures</b> of $ 325. Mean annual incremental absenteeism was 2. 2 days and mean annual incremental absenteeism costs were $ 715. 74. ^ In conclusion, osteoarthritis was associated with considerable incremental health care resource utilization and expenditures. Presence of osteoarthritis was also associated with significant incremental absenteeism and incremental absenteeism costs. ...|$|R
