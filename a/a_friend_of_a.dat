500|$|In 1894, the [...] "blue pebbles" [...] were {{recognized}} as sapphires. [...] One story credits {{a local school}} teacher for recognizing the blue pebbles as sapphires.

Another story credits a miner named S.S. Hobson for surmising that the blue stones might be sapphires, and his guess was confirmed by a jeweler in Helena. [...] Ultimately, in 1895, Jake Hoover sent a cigar box containing those he had collected while mining gold to an assay office, which in turn sent them via regular, uninsured mail to Tiffany's in New York City for appraisal by Dr. George Frederick Kunz, the leading American gemologist of the time.

2500|$|The teller of {{an urban}} legend may claim it {{happened}} to a friend (or to <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend), which serves to personalize, authenticate and enhance {{the power of the}} narrative while distancing the teller. Many urban legends depict horrific crimes, contaminated foods, or other situations which would potentially affect many people. Anyone believing such stories might feel compelled to warn loved ones. Not seldom, news organizations, school officials and even police departments have issued warnings concerning the latest threat. According to the [...] "Lights Out" [...] rumor, [...] street-gang members would drive without headlights until a compassionate motorist responded with the traditional flashing of headlights, whereupon a prospective new gang-member would have to murder the citizen as a requirement of initiation. A fax received at the Nassau County, Florida fire department was forwarded to police, and from there to all city departments. Even the Minister of Defence for Canada was taken in by the same legend; he forwarded an urgent security warning to all Ontario Members of Parliament.|$|E
