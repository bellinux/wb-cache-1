5|$|For {{purposes}} of geophysical and oceanographic research {{and to determine}} habitability, endurance and psychological stress – all extremely important to the Polaris program – it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.|$|E
5|$|Pursuit of {{specific}} and narrow <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{is one of}} the most striking possible features of AS. Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic. For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography. This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6. Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{levels in the}} {{covariation}} model: high and low. Each of these levels influences the three covariation model criteria. High consensus is when many people can agree on an event or <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Low consensus is when very few people can agree. High distinctiveness is when the event or <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is very unusual, whereas low distinctness is when the event or <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is fairly common. High consistency is when the event or <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> continues for a length of time and low consistency is when the event or <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> goes away quickly.|$|R

5|$|The {{unity of}} NATO was {{breached}} early in its history, with a crisis occurring during Charles de Gaulle's presidency of France from 1958 onwards. De Gaulle protested at the United States' strong {{role in the}} organization and what he perceived as a special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 17 September 1958, he argued {{for the creation of}} a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the United States and the United Kingdom, and also for the expansion of NATO's coverage to include geographical <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to France, most notably French Algeria, where France was waging a counter-insurgency and sought NATO assistance.|$|E
5|$|Two {{locations}} on the Moon were given primary consideration for exploration by the Apollo 16 expedition: the Descartes Highlands region west of Mare Nectaris and the crater Alphonsus. At Descartes, the Cayley and Descartes formations {{were the primary}} <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in that scientists suspected, based on telescopic and orbital imagery, that the terrain found there was formed by magma more viscous than that which formed the lunar maria. The Cayley Formation's age was approximated {{to be about the}} same as Mare Imbrium based on the local frequency of impact craters. The considerable distance between the Descartes site and previous Apollo landing sites would be beneficial for the network of geophysical instruments, portions of which were deployed on each Apollo expedition beginning with Apollo 12.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the comparison of two inlet boundary approaches of numerical simulations. The first approach is based on the simulation of a sufficiently long duct upstream the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> with known volumetric flow rate. The second approach rests on the experimental measurement of the section closer to the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> The experimental measurement provides velocity profile and in addition turbulent intensity compared to the first approach where only a velocity profile can be computed according to known volumetric flow rate. A simplified model of car ventilation outlet was chosen as a test case. The model consists of circular and rectangular duct, <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> (closing flap, vertical slats and horizontal slats) and outlet box. We have compared the two mentioned inlet boundary approaches for two distinct values of volumetric flow rate for which the experimental data of the section upstream <b>of</b> the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> are available. The velocity and the turbulent kinetic energy profiles downstream <b>of</b> the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> were chosen as comparative characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Sensor nodes are {{deployed}} to sense an {{environment for the}} purpose of observing physical world. An <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> can be represented as an ellipse. This paper proposes an algorithm for covering an elliptical shaped <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> within wireless sensor network fields by modifying Hilbert-space filling curves. Conventionally, an area is partitioned into 2 n x 2 n square grid (Hilbert cells). Hilbert space-filling curves is modified to mapped only specific <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> While covering the entire <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> the algorithm also provides mobility pattern for a sink node in collecting data for a specific mission by traversing the area from an entry point and finish at an exit point of the square grid. Experimental results show that modified Hilbert spacefilling curves achieve its best Hilbert-covering for an ellipse that is almost circular as oppose to narrow ellipse...|$|R
