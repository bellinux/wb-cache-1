To {{minimize}} its nutation motion, {{the mass}} {{properties of the}} satellite are comprehensively managed from the component level to the system level. In the launch configuration, the SAPs, masts, and wire probe antennas are stowed so the maximum moment of the inertia axis is not aligned to the spin axis, and therefore, the satellite is geometrically spin unstable.

The <b>active</b> <b>nutation</b> <b>control</b> method was also simulated and an example of its operation given. The amount of time required to reduce nutation to an acceptable level was found to be dependent on the initial nutation angle, spin rate, and thruster size.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{precession}} thrust pulses and energy dissipation upon nutation of a spin-stabilized spacecraft are studied. Methods for <b>controlling</b> <b>nutation</b> during a precession maneuver are proposed and examined. A precession modulation control law is developed which uses precession thrust pulses to <b>control</b> <b>nutation.</b> Digital simulations show that precession <b>control</b> with separate <b>nutation</b> <b>control</b> {{is the fastest}} precessing system; however, the precession modulation method is only fractionally slower while not requiring a separate <b>nutation</b> <b>control</b> system...|$|R
40|$|A {{control law}} is {{developed}} for the SAS-D <b>nutation</b> <b>control</b> system. <b>Nutation</b> is removed in a sub-optimal manner with respect to fuel consumed, but attitude errors are minimized. The research performed consist of an investigation of nutation theory and nutation due to energy dissipation, nutation detection analysis, <b>nutation</b> <b>control</b> analysis, and error analysis. The resulting <b>nutation</b> <b>control</b> system uses an accelerometer or rate gyro to sense the nutation angle theta which varies sinusoidally at the nutation frequency omega. The sensed nutation angle is compared with a threshold theta sub tau. If the sensed nutation is greater, a thrust pulse of duration equal to the period of one spin cycle is initiated. Since the threshold theta sub tau is set equal {{to the amount of}} nutation that can be removed by one thrust pulse of duration equal to one spin cycle, the spacecraft nutation is reduced to near zero. Error analysis indicates that the nutation sensed, the threshold, the amount of nutation that can be removed during one thrust pulse, and the time duration of one thrust pulse are all sensitive to the spacecraft spin frequency imparted by the Delta rocket. Thus, the <b>nutation</b> <b>control</b> system was designed to be adaptive to the possible variations in imparted spin frequency...|$|R

40|$|Ulysses is a spin-stabilized {{spacecraft}} {{that experienced}} significant nutation after its launch in October 1990. This {{was due to}} the Sun-spacecraft-Earth geometry, and a study of the phenomenon predicted that the nutation would again be a problem during 1994 - 95. The difficulty of obtaining nutation estimates in real time from the spacecraft telemetry forced the ESA/NASA Ulysses Team to explore alternative information sources. The work performed by the ESA Operations Team provided a model for a system that uses the radio signal strength measurements to monitor the spacecraft dynamics. These measurements (referred to as AGC) are provided once per second by the tracking stations of the DSN. The system was named ARGOS (Attitude Reckoning from Ground Observable Signals) after the ever-vigilant, hundred-eyed giant of Greek Mythology. The ARGOS design also included Doppler processing, because Doppler shifts indicate thruster firings commanded by the <b>active</b> <b>nutation</b> <b>control</b> carried out onboard the spacecraft. While there is some visibility into thruster activity from telemetry, careful processing of the high-sample-rate Doppler data provides an accurate means of detecting the presence and time of thruster firings.

40|$|In {{a method}} of and {{apparatus}} for damping nutation of a spinning spacecraft, spin axis attitude disturbances are substantially reduced by controlling at least one nutation damping gas thruster to fire with nonuniform gas pulses. During {{the beginning of a}} <b>nutation</b> <b>control</b> sequence, the duration of successive gas pulses is gradually increased (up pulsed) from zero to a predetermined maximum duration. The duration of successive pulses is then maintained constant for a time period. Finally, {{at the end of the}} <b>nutation</b> <b>control</b> sequence, the duration of successive gas pulses is gradually reduced to zero (down pulsed).

40|$|Testing of a {{particular}} <b>nutation</b> <b>control</b> system for the synchronous meteorological satellite (SMS) is described. The test method and principles are applicable to <b>nutation</b> angle <b>control</b> for other satellites with similar requirements. During its ascent to synchronous orbit, a spacecraft like the SMS spins about its minimum-moment-of-inertia axis. An uncontrolled spacecraft in this state is unstable because torques due to fuel motion increase the nutation angle. However, the SMS is equipped with an automatic <b>nutation</b> <b>control</b> (ANC) system which will keep the nutation angle close to zero. Because correct operation of this system is critical to mission success, it was tested on an air-bearing table. The ANC system was mounted on the three-axis air-bearing table which was scaled to the SMS and equipped with appropriate sensors and thrusters. The table was spun up in an altitude chamber and nutation induced so that table motion simulated spacecraft motion. The ANC system was used to reduce the nutation angle.

Its primary goal is to discover the fundamental plasma physics processes of reconnection in the Earth's magnetosphere. Each of the four MMS spacecraft is spin-stabilized at a nominal rate of 3 RPM. Traditional spin-stabilized spacecraft have used a number of separate modes to <b>control</b> <b>nutation,</b> spin rate, and precession. To {{reduce the number of}} modes and simplify operations, the Delta-H control mode is designed to accomplish <b>nutation</b> <b>control,</b> spin rate control, and precession control simultaneously. A nonlinear design technique, Lyapunov's method, is used to design the Delta-H control mode. A global spin rate controller selected as the baseline controller for MMS, proved to be insufficient due to an ambiguity in the attitude. Lyapunov's design method was used to solve this ambiguity, resulting in a controller that meets the design goals.

40|$|In general, most of {{communication}} satellites {{were designed to}} be operated in geostationary orbit. And {{many of them were}} designed in prolate dual-spin configuration. As a prolate dual-spin vehicle, they have to be stabilized against their internal energy dissipation effect.

40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{is described}} for <b>controlling</b> <b>nutation</b> motion in a spinning body, comprised of an angular accelerometer with its input axis {{perpendicular to the}} spin axis of the body, a flywheel with an axis of rotation perpendicular to the axis of the accelerometer and to the spin axis of the body, and a motor for driving the flywheel to attenuate or build nutation. The motor is controlled by circuitry that monitors {{the output of the}} angular accelerometer and drives the motor clockwise or counterclockwise during predetermined nutation angles synchronized to the zero crossover points of the accelerometer signal centered about the nutation peaks. The motor drive is phased to damp nutation motion to zero for stabilization. To increase the noise immunity of the system, when the output of the accelerometer falls below a threshold level, the circuitry operates in an open loop, beat mode where data representing the last accelerometer signal that exceeded that threshold level is stored, and the motor drive is controlled by the stored data. In a second version, the motor is controlled to supply a predetermined amount of nutation motion to a body undergoing testing on a spin table for energy dissipation evaluation. In each version, the use of an angular accelerometer rather than a linear accelerometer or gyro to monitor nutation enables placement of the <b>nutation</b> <b>control</b> apparatus at any location relative to the spin axis of the body requiring only crude orientation and no calibration...|$|R
