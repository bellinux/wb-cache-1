40|$|Background & aims: The main {{objectives}} of weight loss interventions {{in children and}} adolescents are to decrease fat mass while maintaining fat-free mass. Several methods are available to assess childhood and adolescence obesity, such as weight and height, bioelectrical impedance, skin-fold thickness measurements and other laboratory methods. The aim was to assess simple anthropometric indices as predictors of body-fat changes, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements as reference method. Methods: Multi-intervention <b>approach</b> (<b>diet,</b> physical activity and psychological support in a family group- based treatment) was implemented with a one-year follow-up in 13 - to- 16 -year-old overweight or obese Spanish adolescents. A total of 83 adolescents were recruited from Granada and Zaragoza, males (n= 43) (31. 6 kg/m 2) and females (n= 40) (32. 0 kg/m 2). We measured body composition with anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. All measurements were made at baseline, and after 2 and 13 months. Random coefficient regression model was used to calculate the proportion of body composition changes during follow-up that would be explained by simple body composition indices based on anthropometric measures. Results: After controlling for age and Tanner stage, body mass index explained 76. 5...|$|E

40|$|The rise in gestational {{diabetes}} (GDM), {{defined as}} first onset or diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy, {{is a global}} problem. GDM {{is often associated with}} unhealthy diet and is a major contributor to adverse outcomes maternal and fetal outcomes. Manipulation of nutrition has the potential to prevent GDM. We assessed the effects of nutritional manipulation in pregnancy on GDM and relevant maternal and fetal outcomes by a systematic review of the literature. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database from inception to March 2014 without any language restrictions. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) of nutritional manipulation to prevent GDM were included. We summarised dichotomous data as relative risk (RR) and continuous data as standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95 % confidence interval (CI). From 1761 citations, 20 RCTs (6, 444 women) met the inclusion criteria. We identified the following interventions: diet-based (n = 6), mixed <b>approach</b> (<b>diet</b> and lifestyle) interventions (n = 13), and nutritional supplements (myo-inositol n = 1, diet with probiotics n = 1). Diet based interventions reduced the risk of GDM by 33 % (RR 0. 67; 95 % CI 0. 39, 1. 15). Mixed approach interventions based on diet and lifestyle had no effect on GDM (RR 0. 95; 95 % CI 0. 89, 1. 22). Nutritional supplements probiotics combined with diet (RR 0. 40; 95 % CI 0. 20, 0. 78) and myo-inositol (RR 0. 40; 95 % CI 0. 16, 0. 99) were assessed in one trial each and showed a beneficial effect. We observed a significant interaction between the groups based on BMI for diet-based intervention. The risk of GDM was reduced in obese and overweight pregnant women for GDM (RR 0. 40, 95 % CI 0. 18, 0. 86). Nutritional manipulation in pregnancy based on diet or mixed approach do not appear {{to reduce the risk of}} GDM.

40|$|Abstract Background Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS), {{a functional}} bowel disorder with symptoms of abdominal pain and disturbed defecation experienced by 10 % of U.

Conventional medical care focusing on pharmacological <b>approaches,</b> <b>diet,</b> and lifestyle management has been partially effective in controlling symptoms. Behavioral treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnosis, are promising. This paper describes an on-going feasibility study {{to assess the}} efficacy of mindfulness training, a behavioral treatment involving directing and sustaining attention to present-moment experience, {{for the treatment of}} IBS. Methods/Design The study design involves randomization of adult women with IBS according to Rome II criteria, to either an eight-week mindfulness training group (based on a Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction [MBSR] format) or a previously validated IBS social-support group as an attention-control condition. The primary hypothesis is that, compared to Support Group participants, those in the Mindfulness Program will demonstrate significant improvement in IBS symptoms as measured by the IBS Symptom Severity Scale 1.

40|$|International audienceDuring chick-rearing, {{albatrosses}} can {{alternate between}} long foraging trips {{that provide the}} main source of food for the adults and short foraging trips that they use to feed their young. This flexibility in foraging behaviour can lead to differences in diet composition between adults and chicks and implies that they may be vulnerable in different ways to food shortages. The trophic ecology of the Greyheaded albatross Thalassarche chrysostoma was investigated at the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands during the chick-rearing period in April 2006 using a combination of <b>approaches.</b> <b>Diets</b> of adults and chicks were assessed using stable isotope ratios and fatty acid (FA) profiles of blood and/or stomach oils, in addition to stomach contents analysis. Fish from the family Macrouridae and cephalopods (particularly the onychoteuthid Kondakovia longimana) were the primary prey, whereas crustaceans (krill Euphausia superba) represented a smaller proportion of the stomach contents. Stomach oil FA profiles contained more monounsaturated FA than the profiles of plasma, which were richer in saturated FA and arachidonic acid (20 : 4 n- 6). There was also a distinct separation of adults from chicks, with higher levels of monounsaturates in chick plasma, and higher saturated FA levels (particularly 16 : 0) in the adult plasma. Stable carbon isotope ratios of whole blood were similar in adults and chicks, whereas stable nitrogen isotope ratios showed significant enrichment by [1 % in chicks. The combined FA, stable isotopes and stomach contents analyses suggest clear differences in diet quality between adults and chicks, with chicks feeding at a higher trophic position through feeding more on highly nutritious fish and adults keeping much of the less nutritious zooplankton for themselves...|$|R

40|$|Diet is a {{cornerstone}} of the prevention and management of chronic lifestyle related disease. The components of healthy diets have been noted in terms of nutrients (such as fat, fibre, calcium), whole foods (such as core food groups) {{and in terms of}} cuisines, such as the Mediterranean diet. Much of the research underpinning the evidence for the nutrient profiles of healthy diets comes from mechanistic studies involving in vitro and animal model studies, or observational studies where assessments of food intake have been converted to food components.
