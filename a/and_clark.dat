His parents were pioneer John Floyd, who was killed by Native Americans twelve days before his son's birth, and Jane Buchanan.

5|$|In 1937, Stackpole {{received}} {{a commission to}} sculpt his interpretation of Colorado River explorer John Wesley Powell, for display in the Main Interior Building of the U.S. Department of Interior. It {{was to be a}} companion piece to Heinz Warneke's portrayal of the Lewis <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition. Warneke learned that Stackpole intended a water scene, so he changed his portrayal of Lewis <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> {{to be one of them}} on land. Stackpole and Warneke delivered their stone reliefs in 1940, and the two panels were mounted on either side of the stage of the building's auditorium.|$|E

5|$|At the {{election}} party, Lana arrives with Chloe, but she once again leaves again when Lex calls. This time Lex kisses {{her when he}} learns of her break up, which causes Lana to leave. Like before, Lex pursues Lana, but this time Clark arrives in time to stop the bus. Jonathan goes to the farm after receiving a mysterious call during the party, and is greeted by Lionel Luthor (John Glover). Lionel insinuates he knows Clark's secret and shows a picture to Jonathan, which causes Jonathan to begin punching Lionel in anger. Jonathan dismisses Lionel and laboriously walks away, breathing heavily. Martha <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> drive up and catch him as he has a heart attack, and, after taking a final look at his family, Jonathan dies {{in the arms of}} Martha <b>and</b> <b>Clark.</b> At Jonathan's funeral, all of Clark's close friends attend, as well as the Luthors.

5000|$|In 1988, paleontologists Michael Benton <b>and</b> J.M. <b>Clark</b> {{produced}} a new {{tree in a}} phylogenetic study of basal archosaurs. As in Gauthier's tree, Benton <b>and</b> <b>Clark's</b> revealed a basal split within Archosauria. They referred to the two groups as Crocodylotarsi and Ornithosuchia. Crocodylotarsi was defined as an apomorphy-based taxon based {{on the presence of}} a [...] "crocodile-normal" [...] ankle joint (considered to be the defining apomorphy of the clade). Gauthier's Pseudosuchia, by contrast, was a stem-based taxon. Unlike Gauthier's tree, Benton <b>and</b> <b>Clark's</b> places Euparkeria outside Ornithosuchia and outside the crown group Archosauria altogether.|$|R
