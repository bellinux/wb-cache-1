5|$|Restaurant menu: During {{the early}} Song Dynasty (960–1279), {{expanding}} trade and commerce brought money and {{people to the}} Song Chinese capital. The world's first restaurants sprang up and food like dumplings and noodles became available to the masses for <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>price.</b> Urban shopkeepers of the merchant middle class often had little time to eat at home, so they ventured out to eat {{at a variety of}} establishments such as temples, taverns, tea houses, food stalls, and restaurants which provided business for nearby brothels, singing-girl houses, and drama theaters; this along with traveling foreigners and Chinese who migrated to urban centers from regions with different cooking styles encouraged a demand for a variety of flavors served at urban restaurants, giving rise to the menu.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31BC, Octavian {{consolidated}} his political power and in 27BC was named Augustus by the Roman Senate, becoming the first Roman emperor. Around this time, Tiridates II of Parthia briefly overthrew Phraates IV, {{who was able to}} quickly reestablish his rule with the aid of Scythian nomads. Tiridates fled to the Romans, taking one of Phraates' sons with him. In negotiations conducted in 20BC, Phraates arranged for the release of his kidnapped son. In return, the Romans received the lost legionary standards taken at Carrhae in 53BC, as well as any surviving prisoners of war. The Parthians viewed this exchange as <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>price</b> to pay to regain the prince. Augustus hailed the return of the standards as a political victory over Parthia; this propaganda was celebrated in the minting of new coins, the building of a new temple to house the standards, and even in fine art such as the breastplate scene on his statue Augustus of Prima Porta.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} must {{investigate}} the surroundings through finding and entering doors. These doors contain shops where players can buy equipment, rooms which provide additional information {{needed in the}} quest, traps which contain powerful enemies, and exits {{to the next level}} which can be opened after finding a key. Some of the doors in the game are hidden and can only be found through by trial and error. At the beginning of the game, shops are visible and are clearly marked with the appropriate signs. Later on in the game, as Wonder Boy gets closer to the MEKA Dragon, the shop doors become unmarked while others are traps set by the level's bosses; {{near the end of the}} game, many of the shops are invisible and contain more powerful weapons. There are four types of shops throughout the game: boot shops allow the player to buy boots which make Wonder Boy jump higher and run faster, armor shops contain armor which makes Wonder Boy incur less damage from enemy attacks, shield shops contain shields which allow him to repel fire from enemies, and magical shops allow players to purchase Magic Weapons. There are also various rooms in the game which the player can enter and receive additional assistance in the quest: taverns where players can buy drinks and receive information from the bartender, Fortune Teller rooms where players may receive information about future events, and hospitals which allow players to refill their life meter and Hourglass Timer for <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>price.</b> Other rooms contain a boss in which the player must defeat to get the key to the next level, to earn additional gold, or to upgrade to a more powerful sword.|$|E

Later next day 40 of the 60 men of A Company set out for Cedar Lake, the sergeants failed to check that every soldier had filled their canteens. In the heat of the day, those that had been drinking the evening before were terribly parched and did not ration their water. Their example led many recruits to drain their canteens. The buffalo hunters carried more water than the soldiers knowing that the heat and weather would impact finding water. They also were conditioned to the heat and maintained a high level of water discipline.|$|E
40|$|Using {{high-frequency}} {{data from}} the European Climate Exchange (ECX), we examine the determinants of price impact of € 21 billion worth of block trades during 2008 – 2011 in the European carbon market. We find that wider bid-ask spreads and volatility are characterised by <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>price</b> impact. Larger levels of price impact {{are more likely to}} occur {{during the middle of the}} trading day, specifically the four-hour period between 11 a. m. and 3 p. m., than during the first or final hours. Purchase block trades induce <b>a</b> relatively <b>smaller</b> <b>price</b> impact on price run-up, while sell block trades exhibit a larger price impact on price run-up. We conclude that block trades on the ECX induce less price impact than in equity or conventional futures markets, and that a significant proportion of the effects contradict findings on block trades in those markets; thus, we provide the first evidence of the curious bent to block trading in the European Union emissions trading scheme...|$|R

We find that even without market power the price in the summer season may be lower than the expected price in the winter season. Market power may in some situations lead to higher sales and lower price in summer than the competitive outcome and in other situations to the opposite result. Furthermore, market power may lead to <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>price</b> difference between summer and winter than in a competitive marke...|$|R
25|$|Public {{buildings}} and monuments, secular and religious, by their nature normally address {{the whole of}} society, and visitors as viewers, and display {{to the general public}} has long been an important factor in their design. Egyptian temples are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests. Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>price,</b> or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the Palace of Versailles, where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.|$|E
25|$|Both of the lovers' fates are {{interwoven}} {{yet they}} deceive {{the other in}} a fight for dominance that Cleopatra wins for a while as the audience and other characters throughout the play know completely {{what is going on in}} the play filled with dramatic irony. Enobarbus once again knows of Antony's unrelenting attachment to Cleopatra and Cleopatra's mind games while the audience knows Cleopatra isn't dead as Antony kills himself over her. They both spent their whole lives trying to achieve higher fame than the other and became notorious for their lust. They are their own Gods and live separate from those that they call normal and watch. The play progresses into the protagonists decline in fame, leaving them to pursue a sure way into that immortality they coveted. They become immortals in death along with even more fame and has as well achieved their goal from the beginning. They die in the name of their love when they really die in the name of fame. A status of nobility higher than us and pity for the tragedy that is their relationship. The tragedy is Antony and Cleopatra's own happy ending as death was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>price</b> to pay to become real gods. They proved that the only death that could touch them were by their own hand, further increasing that godly power they received from the people. Now they are apart from those they watched, now they are above them, and now they will be worshipped as gods.|$|E

A study of Florida Department of Citrus advertising for orange juice indicated that the free rider problem has notably limited the impact of advertising on price in the U. S. market. High U.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} best-price {{guarantees}} can enhance welfare, {{in contrast to}} findings in recent literature. While a high-quality monopolist can signal its quality strictly through high prices, using both price and a best-price guarantee may allow the firm to signal its quality with <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>price</b> distortion. <b>A</b> low-quality monopolist will not mimic its high-quality counterpart by offering a best-price guarantee, because the accompanying restrictions are too costly. Best-price guarantees are similar to money-back guarantees and other more general contracts {{in their ability to}} allow less costly signaling. The welfare enhancing capabilities of these contracts imply that the antitrust authorities should regard them more favorably. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} how {{the supply}} of liquid capital affects the liquidity of asset markets. The article views the former notion as a technological property of real investments and the latter as an endogenous property of financial market equilibrium, and describes a channel by which the two are linked. When agents hold more wealth in technologically liquid investments, a marginal adjustment to portfolio holdings alters discount rates less, causing <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>price</b> impact. Thus, even without intermediaries or frictions, the stock of transformable capital may be a crucial determinant of the resilience of financial markets. Copyright � The Author(s).

40|$|By generalizing the Leland and Pyle (1977) {{model to}} the case of {{multiple}} correlated assets, this paper studies the signaling and hedging behavior of an intermediary who sells multiple assets in financial markets. Based on information asymmetry, this paper demonstrates the intrinsic interdependence of risk management and asset selling for intermediaries, and obtains several testable empirical implications. For instance, an intermediary with a more diversified underlying portfolio will face greater liquidity (<b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>price</b> impact) when selling assets to the market. Several applications are discussed, including bank loan sales and selling mechanisms. The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies.
