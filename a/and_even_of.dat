5|$|There {{were rumors}} of plots <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>of</b> his escape, {{but in reality}} no serious {{attempts}} were made. For English poet Lord Byron, Napoleon was the epitome of the Romantic hero, the persecuted, lonely, and flawed genius.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte's {{position}} as First Consul was {{strengthened by the}} successful outcome of the battle and the preceding campaign. After this victory, Napoleon could breathe a sigh of relief. The generals who had been hostile to him could see that his luck had not abandoned him. Thus, he had surpassed Schérer, Joubert, Championnet, and even Moreau, none {{of whom had been}} able to inflict a decisive blow on the Coalition. Moreau's victory at Hohenlinden, which was the one that in reality had {{put an end to the}} war, was minimised by Bonaparte who, from then on, would pose as a saviour of the fatherland, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>of</b> the Republic. He rejected offers from Louis XVIII, who had considered the Consulate to be a mere transition towards the restoration of the king. Thanks to the victory at Marengo, Napoleon could finally set about reforming France according to his own vision.|$|E

5|$|While Mackay's account {{held that}} {{a wide array of}} society was {{involved}} in the tulip trade, Goldgar's study of archived contracts found that even at its peak the trade in tulips was conducted almost exclusively by merchants and skilled craftsmen who were wealthy, but not members of the nobility. Any economic fallout from the bubble was very limited. Goldgar, who identified many prominent buyers and sellers in the market, found fewer than half a dozen who experienced financial troubles in the time period, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>of</b> these cases {{it is not clear that}} tulips were to blame. This is not altogether surprising. Although prices had risen, money had not changed hands between buyers and sellers. Thus profits were never realized for sellers; unless sellers had made other purchases on credit in expectation of the profits, the collapse in prices did not cause anyone to lose money.|$|E
5|$|While the amir al-umara Ibn Ra'iq was {{in power}} in Baghdad (936–938) with al-Ikhshid's old friend al-Fadl ibn Ja'far ibn al-Furat as vizier, {{relations}} with Baghdad were good. Following Ibn Ra'iq's replacement by the Turk Bajkam, however, Ibn Ra'iq received a nomination by the caliph to the governorship of Syria and in 939 marched west to claim it from al-Ikhshid's forces. Ibn Ra'iq's appointment enraged al-Ikhshid, who sent an envoy to Baghdad to clarify the situation. There Bajkam informed him that the caliph might appoint whomever he chose, but that it ultimately did not matter: it was military strength that would determine who was governor of Syria <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>of</b> Egypt, not any appointment by a figurehead caliph. If either Ibn Ra'iq or al-Ikhshid emerged victorious from the conflict, caliphal confirmation would soon follow. Al-Ikhshid was even more infuriated by the reply, and reportedly for a time even threatened to give one of his daughters to the Fatimid caliph al-Qa'im and to have coins minted and the Friday prayer read in his name rather than the Abbasid caliph, until the Abbasids formally reconfirmed his position. The Fatimids themselves were preoccupied with the revolt of Abu Yazid and were unable to offer any assistance.|$|E
5|$|William Rolleston, at {{the time}} Provincial Secretary, {{proposed}} to Mary Brittan in early 1865. He was 34 {{at the time}}, and she was 19. Both Joseph and Sophia Brittan were opposed to this marriage, which is surprising, given that Rolleston was intelligent, well educated, successful, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>of</b> higher social standing. They thought {{he was too old}} for their daughter, and that she was too young to marry. Perhaps Sophia Brittan did not want to lose her daughter, who was in effect running the household and entertaining guests, as she was often too ill to look after these tasks herself. Despite parental objections, an engagement was announced, soon after which Rolleston was offered and accepted the role of Under Secretary for Native Affairs, requiring a move to Wellington. Hence, the wedding went ahead on 24 May 1865 at Avonside Trinity Church, after which the newly-weds moved to the capital.|$|E

25|$|Several critics {{notice the}} {{fundamental}} {{rhythm of the}} story, a rhythm of tension and relief simultaneously characteristic of the sentences, the state of mind of Captain Delano (the center of consciousness of the tale), <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>of</b> {{the structure of the}} novella as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Canons were {{recruited}} {{primarily from the}} secular aristocracy. Whilst most canons came from the lower nobility, several belonged to the higher nobility by birth.

Examples are Jakob Matsson of the Rømer family, Henrik Nilsson of the Gyldenløve family, and Elling Pedersson of the Oxe family.|$|E

25|$|The Romans, {{for their}} part, were, {{for a long}} time, unable to {{eradicate}} their enemy because of the Numidians' extraordinary mobility and ability to win the support of many desert tribes <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>of</b> more sedentary Numidian tribes within Roman territory. Tacfarinas was finally caught and killed in AD 24 {{by a combination of}} determined pursuit and a lucky break in intelligence.|$|E
25|$|This {{requires}} a metric {{of importance for}} prioritizing Web pages. The importance of a page {{is a function of}} its intrinsic quality, its popularity in terms of links or visits, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>of</b> its URL (the latter is the case of vertical search engines restricted to a single top-level domain, or search engines restricted to a fixed Web site). Designing a good selection policy has an added difficulty: it must work with partial information, as the complete set of Web pages is not known during crawling.|$|E
25|$|While on {{a mission}} to the Gamma Quadrant, Worf was {{captured}} by the Dominion and sent to a Jem'Hadar prison camp where he met the real General Martok and was reunited with the real Dr. Bashir, who had both been captured and replaced by changelings. While the prisoners worked to escape, Worf entered a daily round of combat with each of the guards in turn. He earned the respect and admiration of Martok <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>of</b> the guards because he would not yield. Once the prisoners escaped, they managed to warn the station about the Bashir-changeling.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{the written}} use of Castilian in Galicia was common since 1400, {{at least in}} the {{documents}} issued by the offices of foreigners established in the country, since 1500 the open substitution of Galician elites by Castilian officials led to the progressive discrimination of Galician language <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>of</b> Galician people, although public inscriptions in tombstones and foundations were still common during much of the 16th century. These developments led to the apparition of a series of literary and historical works which goal was the vindication of Galician history, language, people and culture, most notably during the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} already two other Argentine trips to South Georgia: on December 1981, {{on board the}} Argentine {{icebreaker}} ARA Almirante Irízar, when Davidoff made an inventory of the facilities; and on February 1982, when an alleged commercial rival of Davidoff, bank employee Adrian Marchessi, made an unannounced visit to Leith. Marchessi assessed Leith facilities on board the Panamanian registered yacht Caiman, which had sailed out of Mar del Plata. He later reported himself to Grytviken, claiming that {{he was part of}} Davidoff's scheme and giving the British authorities details of the December inspection <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>of</b> early Argentine trips during the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Troussay has, {{other than}} the aspect of Renaissance manor, a second center of interest: that of the Solognot field, {{cultivated}} {{until the middle of}} the 20th century by an almost completely autonomous community. The two commons buildings made it possible to house the farm personnel and the animals (pigs, bovines, horses, asses), and thus storing the reserves of food and manufacturing wine, bread, etc. Nowadays, the museum of the Sologne, rich with many agricultural elements and everyday life of the 19th century, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>of</b> the screw pitch of the press used in the 16th century, recalls this aspect of daily life in Troussay.|$|E

25|$|In December 1991, a new {{constitution}} was drafted and subsequently adopted, after a popular referendum, which, however, attracted criticism from international observers who accused the government of manipulating the population <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>of</b> outright fraud. (The constitution was most recently revised by a national referendum on 18–19 October 2003, again plagued by fraud accusations made by internal and international observers.) The {{new constitution}}, which took effect 29 October 2003, follows {{the structure of the}} Constitution of 1991, but makes significant revisions, among which the most significant are extension of the presidential mandate from four years to five, and the guaranteed protection of private property.|$|E
25|$|In {{an earlier}} work, Le Maghreb entre deux guerres ("The Maghreb between two world wars", 1962), Berque criticizes the colonial system. His {{administrative}} and ethnographic experience eventually {{took him in}} a direction adopted by few North-African-born Frenchmen or by colonial administrators: he came out in favour of independence. Berque {{was one of the}} few Europeans who retained links with the new Algeria after the bloody war. As the theoretician of third-worldist romanticism, he became influential to the entire Arab-Muslim world, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>of</b> the Third World as a whole. Another work on the Maghreb, L'Interieur du Maghreb, XVe-XIXe siecle (1978), gives Berque's own interpretation of its history. Based on a reading of 15 texts which he had taught at the Collège de France, the book runs to more than 500 pages, and is an important document on the history of the Maghreb.|$|E
25|$|At {{its height}} from the 1860s until 1914, the fixture was a prestigious one, though {{in terms of}} quality it fell far short of Test matches <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>of</b> the rival North v. South fixture. Until the 1860s, the Gentlemen teams were often very weak {{compared}} with the professionals, and on occasion the fixture had to be arranged on an odds basis, so that the Players eleven took on {{a greater number of}} Gentlemen. The Gentlemen famously became competitive during the career of W. G. Grace, whose performances were so outstanding that the Gentlemen could enjoy some long-awaited success. The fixture often confirmed the commonly held view of an imbalance between amateur and professional in that amateurs tended to be batsmen first and foremost, hence there were few good amateur bowlers. The Players could nearly always field a strong bowling side.|$|E
