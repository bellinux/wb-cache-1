5|$|By Your Side was {{released}} on January12, 1999. The album's cover art is a blue-tinted nighttime photograph of the band, all dressed in white and {{standing in front of}} a lake. The band name is rendered in tiny white lights <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> and other small white lights are scattered at their feet. In keeping with the tiny lights theme, the back of the booklet shows a satellite image of the United States at night, in which densely populated areas can be discerned by light pollution, and the booklet contains drawings of constellations. The album's disc artwork is designed after a centaur with a crow's head in place of the man's head.|$|E
5|$|For {{short-range}} missile (throwing) weapons, a Roman infantryman {{would probably}} had either a long throwing-spear {{or two or}} three short javelins (lanceae) and half a dozen plumbatae (weighted darts) with an effective range of about 30m. Ammianus talks of a variety of missiles being thrown by the Alamanni in the battle: spicula (a kind of long pilum-type javelin, also known as an angon), verruta missilia (short throwing-spears) and ferratae arundines (probably darts and franciscas: throwing-axes). Overall, there appears little difference in the throwing-missile capability of the contenders. Ammianus indicates that the Roman infantry ranks were obliged to hold their shields <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> for much of the time due to the volume of missiles raining down on them.|$|E
5|$|Kinstones {{are special}} {{artifacts}} which Link can find throughout his quest. Kinstone pieces are fragments of a medallion {{that are found}} {{throughout the course of}} the game. If the player can find a character or object with a Kinstone piece (indicated by a thought bubble <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads),</b> the player can try to fuse their Kinstone piece with one of their own to make a match. If a successful fusion is made, something will occur somewhere within the game's world, including the placement of treasure chests, access to secret areas and certain events which occur among certain characters. Whilst many Kinstone fusions are optional, some fusions, such as those which use Golden Kinstones, are necessary to advance the story.|$|E
25|$|Umpires {{typically}} grab <b>their</b> wrist <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head</b> {{to signal}} that spectator interference has occurred.|$|R
5000|$|An [...] "overhead" [...] {{occurs when}} a player throws a Gonggi stone in any {{distance}} <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|In {{the same}} level, two men--John Paul and Andrew Teague--hearing {{the rush of}} the {{advancing}} torrent <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head,</b> made for a shaft, went up it against a heavy fall of water, and escaped.|$|R
5|$|The prisoners' {{day began}} at 4:30 am (an hour later in winter) with morning roll call. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli {{describes}} roll call as beginning 03:00 and lasting four hours. The weather was cold in Auschwitz {{at that time}} of day, even in summer. The prisoners were ordered to line up outdoors in rows of five and had to stay there until 07:00, when the SS officers arrived. Meanwhile, the guards would force the prisoners to squat for an hour with their hands <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> or levy punishments such as beatings or detention for infractions such as having a missing button or an improperly cleaned food bowl. The inmates were counted and re-counted. Nyiszli describes how even the dead had to be present at roll call, standing supported by their fellow inmates until the ordeal was over. When he was a prisoner in 1944–45, five to ten men were found dead in the barracks each night. The prisoners assigned to Mengele's staff slept in a separate barracks and were awoken at 07:00 for a roll call that only took a few minutes.|$|E
25|$|As the trot past {{ends the}} mounted band salutes the Queen, the drum horse riders {{crossing}} their drumsticks <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> They then proceed {{back to the}} east side of Horse Guards Parade and halt in place.|$|E
25|$|The goal umpire {{signals a}} goal with two hands pointed forward at elbow height, or a behind with one hand. The goal umpire then waves flags <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> {{to confirm the}} goal or behind to the goal umpire at the {{opposite}} end of the ground.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Seconds {{before the}} {{beginning}} of the San Fermín Festival. Town hall Square. Everybody has a red handkerchief <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head</b> until a firework is exploded at 12 pm; putting it around their neck afterward ...|$|R
50|$|A referee can signal {{by raising}} both arms to a {{timekeeper}} {{to take account}} of stoppage time and to stop their watch until signalled again by waving one arm <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head</b> to carry on timing.|$|R
50|$|Visually {{similar to}} Limbo, {{the aim of}} this game is to defeat foes by drawing the symbol that appears <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head.</b> The player control a good force called Lum who must destroy all the evil figures.|$|R
25|$|We have no flag, {{and we need}} one. If we {{desire to}} lead many men, we must raise a symbol <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> I would suggest a white flag, with seven golden stars. The white field symbolizes our pure new life; the stars are the seven golden hours of our working-day. For we shall march into the Promised Land {{carrying}} the badge of honor.|$|E
25|$|The {{image is}} of a funeral {{procession}} of beings, possibly celestial, {{led by an}} angel-figure floating above the ground. The profiles of the figures suggest pre-Columbian art, and possibly an ancient Egyptian influence, as well. The angel-figure {{as well as the}} mourners have luminous peaks <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> in a re-imagining of halos. The shapes of the peaks are repeated by tongues of fire that point up from the bottom edge of the painting. The image strongly suggests an afterworld, {{but it is not clear}} from the image whether the environment correlates to tradition Christian understandings of heaven or hell. Xul Solar provides his viewer with a new image of an afterlife.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eighth}} month, Yuan Shao's army slowly {{advanced}} southward from Yangwu and engaged Cao Cao's men in trench warfare, behind the earthen embankments {{that both sides}} made. Both sides harassed each other with engines of war. Yuan Shao had erected siege-ramps and high platforms which allowed his men to rain arrows onto Cao Cao's forces. In response, Cao Cao's men had to carry their shields <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> and retaliated with traction trebuchets that destroyed the archer platforms. Yuan Shao also tried to tunnel under Cao Cao's fort, but Cao Cao had a large ditch dug within his lines to block the tunnels. Subsequently, neither side could overcome each other as Cao Cao and Yuan Shao became locked in a stalemate.|$|E
5000|$|Brain Matter - Competitors cross a 16" [...] wide (reduced to 6" [...] for the finals) {{suspended}} balance beam {{with the aid}} of a small gear handle <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head.</b> The first Points Thruster is located midway along Brain Matter.|$|R
5000|$|The larvae feed singly on Populus tremula and willow. They {{are green}} with seven pale stripes, {{and look like}} L. populi caterpillars, but, {{opposite}} to it, {{have two or three}} little [...] "horns" [...] <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head.</b> It is difficult to distinguish.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{objective}} of One Piece Mansion is very simple. Every resident in the player's mansion has a stress level, which {{is indicated by}} a small bar <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head.</b> If this level gets too high, they will eventually {{move out of the}} mansion.|$|R
500|$|Prosperity churches place {{a strong}} {{emphasis}} on the importance of giving. Some services include a teaching time focused on giving and prosperity, including Biblical references to tithing; and then a sermon on another topic which follows the offering. Prosperity church leaders often claim a specific blessing can be exchanged for the money being donated to their ministry; some have been reported to instruct worshipers to hold their donations <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> during the prayer.|$|E
500|$|Despite all {{the concern}} over these {{military}} threats, the weather presented the gravest danger. At {{the beginning of}} the operation, pilots in the first wave reported the weather as [...] scattered, [...] overcast with [...] visibility, except in haze over Saigon, where visibility decreased to one mile. This meant that scattered clouds existed below their flight path while a solid layer of clouds more than two miles <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> obscured the sun. The curtain of haze over Saigon so altered the diminished daylight that line of sight visibility was only a mile. The weather conditions deteriorated as the operation continued.|$|E
500|$|During the film's opening number, [...] "Circle of Life", Rafiki {{introduces}} a newborn Simba {{to the crowd}} of animals gathered {{at the foot of}} Pride Rock by holding him high <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> while parents Mufasa and Sarabi look on. Since the film's 1994 release, this scene has grown to iconic status. [...] In November 2002, singer Michael Jackson sparked controversy by holding his son over the protective railing of a hotel balcony in Berlin. [...] The event was witnessed by a large crowd of spectators who were watching from below. [...] Some sources have claimed that Jackson was harmlessly attempting to emulate the scene from The Lion King.|$|E
5000|$|Mess Heads - One {{teammate}} must {{identify a}} food that the host is describing. Once identified, the player must scoop up some slop from a tub and pour {{it into a}} paper bag suspended <b>above</b> <b>their</b> partner's <b>head.</b> The first team to fill the bag with enough slop to make the bag's bottom break <b>above</b> <b>their</b> partner's <b>head</b> won the event.|$|R
50|$|The {{types of}} rescues include {{swimmers}} {{who are in}} <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head</b> such as with rip currents, injuries from minor cuts and scrapes, missing swimmers, serious boating accidents and medical emergencies such as heart attacks. Law enforcement activities include everything from alcohol intoxication to boating violations and violent crimes committed on the beach.|$|R
50|$|The short robust {{skull of}} sthenurines is {{considered}} to be related to a diet of browse. Some species may have been able to reach <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head</b> and grasp branches with their semiopposable hands to assist in procuring leaves from trees. A single hoofed digit is present on the feet of sthenurines.|$|R
500|$|The {{men have}} their names below the busts on the obverse, and wear hats of their period. They gaze toward the legend IN GOD WE TRUST, {{the only one}} of the {{national}} mottos usually present on U.S. coins to appear. The name of the country arcs <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads,</b> while HUGUENOT HALF DOLLAR is below them. Morgan's initial [...] "M" [...] is on Coligny's shoulder. The reverse depicts the ship Nieuw Nederlandt and the words, HUGUENOT – WALLOON – TERCENTENARY – FOUNDING OF NEW NETHERLAND with the years 1624 and 1924 to either side of the ship. Stoudt's sketch for the reverse was also used on the one cent denomination of the stamp set issued in conjunction with the tercentenary.|$|E
500|$|One man and {{one woman}} are chosen for each year the Queen has lived (including the year she is {{currently}} living), and they receive Maundy money equivalent in pence to that number of years. Recipients attend a [...] "Maundy Lecture" [...] in the cathedral {{in advance of the}} service to familiarise them with what will happen. [...] The cathedral is designated the Royal Chapel for the day of the service, and the Royal Standard flies. The purses are carried into the church by the Yeomen on silver dishes, held <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> [...] The origin of this custom is uncertain but apparently dates from the times when provisions were distributed to the poor; some experts believe the dishes were carried high to stop the poor from grabbing at the food prematurely; others believe that the position was to prevent the congregation from being overwhelmed by the smell of fish.|$|E
500|$|After each yell, {{students}} make a noise and a hand motion {{that is known}} as a wildcat. [...] Each class has a separate wildcat, and students caught [...] "pulling out," [...] or using the wildcat of a higher class, are often forced to do pushups as punishment. [...] Freshmen raise their hands <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> and yell [...] "AAAA". [...] Sophomores, symbolically pushing back on the seniors, chant [...] "A!" [...] five times, waving their hands up and {{down in front of the}} torso with their index fingers extended and thumbs perpendicular. [...] Juniors yell [...] "A! A! A! Whoop!" [...] wrapping their left hand over their right fist, with both index fingers extended and pointing towards the ground, [...] "shooting the ground" [...] once for each [...] "A" [...] and holding the position on the [...] "whoop!" [...] As a symbol of their expert marksmanship, seniors yell a single [...] "A!" [...] and then [...] "Whoop!" [...] while interlocking their fingers with their index fingers extended and pointed into the air. [...] At the same time, the left foot is raised and tucked behind the right knee. [...] The fingers are interlocked rather than covering the right hand so that the Aggie Ring is visible.|$|E
50|$|The {{field of}} the coat of arms is azure and charged with three {{vertically}} ordered argent herrings looking {{to the right and}} placed en fasce. All three have a crown or three acanthus leaves (in Dutch heraldry: fleurons) <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head.</b> <b>Above</b> the dorsal spines they have a star containing eight points.|$|R

Exterior view of {{a market}} street in Zanzibar, there are shops and stall with awnings, both thatch and {{corrugated}} metal, {{on both sides of}} the road, and a child in a sarong holding a basket <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head</b> walks towards camera. The street curves round to the left of the image in the distance...|$|R
50|$|Cave 7 {{is located}} {{a few steps}} east of Cave 6. It {{consists}} of a large niche containing damaged figures of the mother goddess, each with a weapon <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head,</b> carved on {{the back wall of}} the cave. The cave is flanked by shallow niches with abraded figures of Kārttikeya and Gaṇeśa, now visible only in outline.|$|R

2500|$|During the Golden Brahman March {{and other}} USF songs, fans will circle the [...] "Go Bulls" [...] hand symbol <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b> Created with the pointer and pinky finger, the gesture {{was first used}} as a good luck symbol during free-throw shots at USF {{basketball}} games. Today, it {{is used as a}} greeting and cheering symbol by USF students and alumni. Often confused by many as the USF fight song, [...] "The Bull" [...] is a rally cry played by the USF Herd of Thunder marching band that encourages fans to stand up and circle the [...] "Go Bulls" [...] hand symbol <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In Nirvana's only {{appearance}} on the show, Kurt Cobain deliberately sang their 1991 hit [...] "Smells like Teen Spirit" [...] in a low monotonous voice (he later claimed to be impersonating Morrissey) and the guitarists waved their guitars around <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>heads</b> during the famous guitar intro of the song.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "celeb-to-be" [...] {{was chosen}} out of {{hundreds}} of applicants, most being eliminated through challenges until a final challenge on the Friday Night Games set. Challenges included holding onto a balloon whilst riding [...] "Wipeout", or holding {{a piece of paper}} <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head</b> whilst riding on the Tower Of Terror, a roller coaster at Dreamworld, without ripping it.|$|R
5000|$|Self Pass - {{a player}} with {{possession}} of the ball is allowed to make a Self Pass by tossing the ball <b>above</b> <b>their</b> <b>head</b> and catching it. This allows the player to take more than two steps. However, a player {{is not allowed to}} make more than two Self Passes. The defense can defend Self Passes by attempting to steal them.|$|R
