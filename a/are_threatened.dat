5|$|Pudús <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> {{due to the}} {{destruction}} of their rainforest habitat. The land is cleared for human development, cattle ranching, agriculture, logging, and exotic tree plantations.|$|E
5|$|While {{some species}} of procellariid have populations that {{number in the}} millions, many species are much less common and several <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> with extinction. Human {{activities}} have caused dramatic declines {{in the numbers of}} some species, particularly species that were originally restricted to one island. According to the IUCN 36 species are listed as vulnerable or worse, with ten critically endangered. Procellariids <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by introduced species on their breeding grounds, marine fisheries, pollution, exploitation and possibly by climate change.|$|E
5|$|Around 59 {{species of}} {{pigeons and doves}} <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> with {{extinction}} today, about 19% of all species. Most of these are tropical and live on islands. All of the species <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by introduced predators, habitat loss, hunting, {{or a combination of}} these factors. In some cases, they may be extinct in the wild, as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats. In some areas, a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown; the Negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953, and {{may or may not be}} extinct, and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the Pacific Ocean is unknown.|$|E
50|$|This species <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat degradation. It {{requires}} open {{habitat for}} germination, but {{this kind of}} habitat <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by introduced flora. It <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> by introduced grazing animals.|$|R
50|$|Scenes where Donald <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> with a {{knife and}} the police officer <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> with an axe have been cut.|$|R
50|$|This plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{firewood}} harvesting, {{which has}} caused habitat destruction in the area. It may also <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by mining operations.|$|R
5|$|Death Valley National Park is {{a popular}} {{location}} for stargazing as it {{has one of the}} darkest night skies in the United States. Despite its remote location, air quality and night visibility <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by civilization. In particular, light pollution is introduced by nearby Las Vegas. The darkest skies are, in general, located in the northwest of the park.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} storm petrel <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by human activities. One species, the Guadalupe storm petrel, {{is thought to}} have gone extinct. The {{principal}} threats to storm petrels are introduced species, particularly mammals, in their breeding colonies; many storm petrels habitually nest on isolated mammal-free islands and are unable to cope with predators like rats and feral cats.|$|E
5|$|There are {{at least}} 139 mammal species. Of the 16 endemic mammals, 13 <b>are</b> <b>{{threatened}}</b> and amongst the 32 threatened species include the critically endangered Malabar large-spotted civet, the endangered lion-tailed macaque, Nilgiri tahr, Bengal tiger and Indian elephants, the vulnerable Indian leopard, Nilgiri langur and gaur.|$|E
50|$|The plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{the loss}} and {{degradation}} of its habitat. In New Mexico it <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by oil and gas development and {{the changes that have}} occurred on the land due to overgrazing, such as erosion and introduced species of plants. In Texas, the plant grows on roadsides and it may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by roadway maintenance.|$|R
25|$|In Utah, its habitat <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{commercial}} development, whereas the Grand Canyon population <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by discharges from the Glen Canyon Dam which can sweep the snail and its habitat downstream.|$|R
50|$|It can <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat loss, but {{the total}} {{population}} is stable and the species <b>is</b> not <b>threatened.</b>|$|R
5|$|Thirty-eight species <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> with {{extinction}} as {{a result}} of human activities. Antbirds are not targeted by either hunters or the pet trade. The principal threat is habitat loss, which causes habitat fragmentation and increased nest predation in habitat fragments.|$|E
5|$|Well-known {{species such}} as the great white shark, tiger shark, blue shark, mako shark, {{thresher}} shark, and hammerhead shark are apex predators—organisms {{at the top of}} their underwater food chain. Many shark populations <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by human activities.|$|E
5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{habitat loss}} due to {{deforestation}} for timber and agriculture and its current status <b>is</b> near <b>threatened.</b>|$|R
50|$|This species <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by livestock, which {{relish the}} semi-succulent leaves. It <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> by {{recreational}} {{activity in the}} habitat.|$|R
50|$|Although {{this species}} <b>is</b> not <b>threatened</b> with extinction, its habitat may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{the spread of}} the garlic mustard (Alliaria officinalis).|$|R
5|$|Coral {{reefs and}} shallow marine environments <b>are</b> <b>threatened,</b> {{not only by}} natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such man-made problems as pollution, sedimentation and destructive fishing practices. Pollution {{may be the result}} of run-off from the land of sewage, agricultural products, fuel or chemicals. These may directly kill or injure marine life, or may encourage the growth of algae that smother native species, or form algal blooms with wide-ranging effects. Oil spills at sea can contaminate reefs, and also affect the eggs and larva of marine life drifting near the surface.|$|E
5|$|In Spain, the red-billed chough has {{recently}} expanded its range by utilising old buildings, with 1,175 breeding pairs in a mi) study area. These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane core areas. However, the populations with nest sites on buildings <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by human disturbance, persecution {{and the loss}} of old buildings. Fossils of both chough species were found in the mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E
5|$|Many procellariids have {{breeding}} {{populations of}} over several million pairs; others number fewer than 200 birds. Humans have traditionally exploited {{several species of}} fulmar and shearwater (known as muttonbirds) for food, fuel, and bait, a practice that continues in a controlled fashion today. Several species <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by introduced species attacking adults and chicks in breeding colonies and by long-line fisheries.|$|E
50|$|Schizolaena parviflora <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{deforestation}} due to shifting {{patterns of}} agriculture. The species <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> by timber harvesting and wildfires.|$|R
50|$|The plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{the loss}} and {{degradation}} of its habitat, mainly due {{to the presence of}} feral pigs and non-native plants. Some of the plant's habitat is on military territory and it may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by military activity.|$|R
50|$|Not {{known to}} <b>be</b> <b>threatened.</b>|$|R
5|$|Slow lorises <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{deforestation}} and {{the wildlife}} trade, {{which includes the}} exotic pet trade, traditional medicine, and bushmeat. Other threats includes road construction, selective logging, and slash and burn agriculture. Habitat fragmentation obstructs biological dispersal for these species that rely on vines and lianas to move from tree to tree. Consequently, slow lorises are found dead on power lines or are victims of roadkill in areas where roads cut between forest patches.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{face the}} same threats as other seabirds; in {{particular}} they <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by introduced species. The Guadalupe storm petrel was driven to extinction by feral cats, and introduced predators have also been responsible for declines in other species. Habitat degradation which limits nesting opportunities caused by introduced goats and pigs is also a problem, especially if it increases competition from more aggressive burrowing petrels.|$|E
5|$|The Picidae {{are just}} one of eight living {{families}} in the order Piciformes, the others being barbets, toucans, and honeyguides in the clade Pici, and the jacamars and puffbirds in the clade Galbuli. DNA sequencing has confirmed the sister relationships of these two groups. The family Picidae includes about 240 species arranged in 35 genera. Almost 20 species <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> with extinction due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation, with one, the Bermuda flicker, being extinct and a further two probably being so.|$|E
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by overexploitation.|$|R
50|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist montane forests. It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat loss. This species {{is listed as}} Near Threatened because it occupies a small range, in which it <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by hunting and limited habitat loss and degradation.|$|R

5|$|The Southern California DPS, {{which was}} listed as {{endangered}} in 2011, has been affected by habitat loss due to dams, confinement of streams in concrete channels, water pollution, groundwater pumping, urban heat island effects, and other byproducts of urbanization. Steelhead in the Kamchatka Peninsula <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by over-harvest, particularly from poaching and potential development, and {{are listed in the}} Red Data Book of Russia that documents rare and endangered species.|$|E
5|$|The {{corncrake}} {{can be seen}} at {{the bridge}} of Banagher in the summer. Once a common summer visitor to Ireland, corncrakes have suffered drastic population declines over the last few decades and <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> with global extinction. Conservation efforts have focused on changing harvesting times to avoid the nesting season, May to August. The hay meadows of the callows support large numbers of these birds – {{one of the few places}} in the world where this globally threatened species is still common.|$|E
5|$|The letter {{begins by}} {{describing}} how Hester {{and her family}} (who in the story represent all citizens) live in fear of the Judges, and have virtually no say over their lives. Even on a family picnic in the park they <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> and intimidated by a judge when their young son accidentally throws a ball at him. Finally deciding that enough is enough, Hester reveals that she has decided to join a terrorist group and take over a television studio at gunpoint to announce their manifesto for reform to the whole city.|$|E
