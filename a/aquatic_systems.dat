25|$|Tissue residue is the {{concentration}} of a chemical or compound in an organism’s tissue, or a portion of an organism’s tissue. Tissue residue is used in aquatic toxicology to help determine the fate of chemicals in <b>aquatic</b> <b>systems,</b> bioaccumulation of a substance, bioavailability of a substance, account for multiple routes of exposure (ingestion, absorption, inhalation), and address an organism’s exposure to chemical mixtures. A Tissue residue approach to toxicity testing is considered a more direct and less variable measure of chemical exposure and is less dependent on external environmental factors than measuring {{the concentration}} of a chemical in the exposure media.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of {{extensive}} cultivation of legumes (particularly soy, alfalfa, and clover), growing use of the Haber–Bosch process {{in the creation of}} chemical fertilizers, and pollution emitted by vehicles and industrial plants, human beings have more than doubled the annual transfer of nitrogen into biologically available forms. In addition, humans have significantly contributed to the transfer of nitrogen trace gases from Earth to the atmosphere and from the land to <b>aquatic</b> <b>systems.</b> Human alterations to the global nitrogen cycle are most intense in developed countries and in Asia, where vehicle emissions and industrial agriculture are highest.|$|E
25|$|Pyridine has a {{flash point}} (the lowest {{temperature}} {{at which it}} can vaporize to form an ignitable mixture in air) of only 17°C and is, therefore, highly flammable. Its ignition temperature is 550°C, and mixtures of 1.7–10.6vol% of pyridine with air are explosive. The thermal modification of pyridine starts above 490°C, resulting in bipyridine (mainly 2,2′-bipyridine {{and to a lesser}} extent 2,3′-bipyridine and 2,4′-bipyridine), nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. Pyridine easily dissolves in water and harms both animals and plants in <b>aquatic</b> <b>systems.</b> The permitted maximum allowable concentration of pyridine was 15–30 parts per million (ppm, or 15–30mg·m−3 in air) in most countries in the 1990s, but was reduced to 5ppm in the 2000s. For comparison, indoor air contaminated with tobacco smoke may contain up to 16µg·m−3 of pyridine, and one cigarette contains 21–32µg.|$|E
25|$|Phosphorus is {{essential}} for life. Phosphates (compounds containing the phosphate ion, PO43−) are a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, and the phospholipids, which form all cell membranes. Demonstrating the link between phosphorus and life, elemental phosphorus was first isolated from human urine, and bone ash was an important early phosphate source. Phosphate mines contain fossils, especially marine fossils, because phosphate {{is present in the}} fossilized deposits of animal remains and excreta. Low phosphate levels are an important limit to growth in some <b>aquatic</b> <b>systems.</b> The vast majority of phosphorus compounds produced are consumed as fertilisers. Phosphate is needed to replace the phosphorus that plants remove from the soil, and its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population. Other applications include the role of organophosphorus compounds in detergents, pesticides, and nerve agents.|$|E

Sampling was done at six sites during one rearing cycle (six months), taking water from the source of water supply, the fish pond itself, the effluent of the fish pond and the mixed waters. A principal component analysis revealed that, among all the environmental variables analyzed, chlorophyll-a, total nitrogen and phosphorus and organic matter were responsible for the variations observed during the rearing cycle.

25|$|Because {{methylmercury}} {{is formed}} in <b>aquatic</b> <b>systems</b> {{and because it}} is not readily eliminated from organisms it is biomagnified in aquatic food chains from bacteria, to plankton, through macroinvertebrates, to herbivorous fish and to piscivorous (fish-eating) fish. At each step in the food chain, the concentration of methylmercury in the organism increases. The concentration of methylmercury in the top level aquatic predators can reach a level a million times higher than the level in the water. This is because methylmercury has a half-life of about 72 days in aquatic organisms resulting in its bioaccumulation within these food chains. Organisms, including humans, fish-eating birds, and fish-eating mammals such as otters and whales that consume fish {{from the top of the}} aquatic food chain receive the methylmercury that has accumulated through this process. Fish and other aquatic species are the only significant source of human methylmercury exposure.|$|E
25|$|The {{duration}} of triclosan in personal product use is relatively short. Upon disposal, triclosan {{is sent to}} municipal sewage treatment plants, where about 97-98% of triclosan is removed. Studies show that substantial quantities of triclosan (170,000 – 970,000kg/yr) can break through wastewater treatment plants and damage algae on surface waters. In a study on effluent from wastewater treatment facilities, approximately 75% of triclocarban was present in sludge. This poses a potential environmental and ecological hazard, particularly for <b>aquatic</b> <b>systems.</b> The volume of triclosan re-entering the environment in sewage sludge after initial successful capture from wastewater is 44,000 ± 60,000kg/yr. Triclosan can attach to other substances suspended in aquatic environments, which potentially endangers marine organisms and may lead to further bioaccumulation. Ozone {{is considered to be}} an effective tool for removing triclosan during sewage treatment. As little triclosan is released through plastic and textile household consumer products, these are not considered to be major sources of triclosan contamination.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{forms of}} {{nitrogen}} {{are most often}} of concern with regard to eutrophication, because plants have high nitrogen requirements so that additions of nitrogen compounds will stimulate plant growth. Nitrogen is not readily available in soil because N2, a gaseous form of nitrogen, is very stable and unavailable directly to higher plants. Terrestrial ecosystems rely on microbial nitrogen fixation to convert N2 into other forms such as nitrates. However, {{there is a limit}} to how much nitrogen can be utilized. Ecosystems receiving more nitrogen than the plants require are called nitrogen-saturated. Saturated terrestrial ecosystems then can contribute both inorganic and organic nitrogen to freshwater, coastal, and marine eutrophication, where nitrogen is also typically a limiting nutrient. This is also the case with increased levels of phosphorus. However, because phosphorus is generally much less soluble than nitrogen, it is leached from the soil at a much slower rate than nitrogen. Consequently, phosphorus is much more important as a limiting nutrient in <b>aquatic</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E

25|$|Innovative {{solutions}} {{have been}} conceived {{to deal with}} nutrient pollution in <b>aquatic</b> <b>systems</b> by altering or enhancing natural processes to shift nutrient effects away from detrimental ecological impacts. Nutrient remediation {{is a form of}} environmental remediation, but concerns only biologically active nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. “Remediation” refers to the removal of pollution or contaminants, generally for the protection of human health. In environmental remediation nutrient removal technologies include biofiltration, which uses living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants. Examples include green belts, riparian areas, natural and constructed wetlands, and treatment ponds. These areas most commonly capture anthropogenic discharges such as wastewater, stormwater runoff, or sewage treatment, for land reclamation after mining, refinery activity, or land development. Biofiltration utilizes biological assimilation to capture, absorb, and eventually incorporate the pollutants (including nutrients) into living tissue. Another form of nutrient removal is bioremediation, which uses microorganisms to remove pollutants. Bioremediation can occur on its own as natural attenuation or intrinsic bioremediation or can be encouraged by the addition of fertilizers, called biostimulation.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Earth's {{elements}} and minerals (or mineral nutrients) are {{contained within the}} tissues and diets of organisms. Hence, mineral and nutrient cycles trace food web energy pathways. Ecologists employ stoichiometry to analyze the ratios {{of the main elements}} found in all organisms: carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P). There is a large transitional difference between many terrestrial and <b>aquatic</b> <b>systems</b> as C:P and C:N ratios are much higher in terrestrial systems while N:P ratios are equal between the two systems. Mineral nutrients are the material resources that organisms need for growth, development, and vitality. Food webs depict the pathways of mineral nutrient cycling as they flow through organisms. Most of the primary production in an ecosystem is not consumed, but is recycled by detritus back into useful nutrients. Many of the Earth's microorganisms are involved in the formation of minerals in a process called biomineralization. Bacteria that live in detrital sediments create and cycle nutrients and biominerals. Food web models and nutrient cycles have traditionally been treated separately, but there is a strong functional connection between the two in terms of stability, flux, sources, sinks, and recycling of mineral nutrients.|$|E
25|$|Assimilation of diet into tissue has a tissue-specific {{fractionation}} {{known as}} the trophic discrimination factor. Diet sources can be tracked through a food web via deuterium isotope profiles, although this is complicated by deuterium having two potential sources - water and food. Food more strongly impacts δD than does exchange with surrounding water, and that signal is seen across trophic levels. However, different organisms derive organic hydrogen in varying ratios of water to food: for example, in quail, 20-30% of organic hydrogen was from water and the remainder from food. The precise percentage of hydrogen from water was dependent on tissue source and metabolic activity. In chironomids, 31-47% of biomass hydrogen derived from water, and in microbes as much as 100% of fatty acid hydrogen {{can be derived from}} water depending on substrate. In caterpillars, diet δD from organic matter correlates linearly with tissue δD. The same relationship does not appear to hold consistently for diet δD from water, however - water derived from either the caterpillar or its prey plant is more deuterium enriched than their organic material. Going up trophic levels from prey (plant) to predator (caterpillar) results in an isotopic enrichment. This same trend of enrichment is seen in many other animals - carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores - and appears to follow 15N relative abundances. Carnivores at the same trophic level tend to exhibit the same level of 2H enrichment. Because, as mentioned earlier, the amount of organic hydrogen produced from water varies between species, a model of trophic level related to absolute fractionation is difficult to make if the participating species are not known. Consistency in measuring the same tissues is also important, as different tissues fractionate deuterium differently. In <b>aquatic</b> <b>systems,</b> tracking trophic interactions is valuable for not only understanding the ecology of the system, but also for determining the degree of terrestrial input. The patterns of deuterium enrichment consistent within trophic levels is a useful tool for assessing the nature of these interactions in the environment.|$|E
