The opposite occurs after breath-holding.|$|E
25|$|The alveoli {{are open}} (via the airways) to the atmosphere, {{with the result}} that <b>alveolar</b> <b>air</b> {{pressure}} is exactly the same as the ambient air pressure at sea level, at altitude, or in any artificial atmosphere (e.g. a diving chamber, or decompression chamber) in which the individual is breathing freely. With expansion of the lungs (through lowering of the diaphragm and expansion of the thoracic cage) the <b>alveolar</b> <b>air</b> now occupies a larger volume, and its pressure falls proportionally, causing air to flow in from the surroundings, through the airways, till the pressure in the alveoli is once again at the ambient air pressure. The reverse obviously happens during exhalation. This process (of inhalation and exhalation) is exactly the same at sea level, as on top of Mt.

25|$|The {{volume of}} air that moves {{in or out}} (at the nose or mouth) during a single {{breathing}} cycle is called the tidal volume. In a resting adult human it is about 500ml per breath. At the end of exhalation the airways contain about 150ml of <b>alveolar</b> <b>air</b> {{which is the first}} air that is breathed back into the alveoli during inhalation. This volume air that is breathed out of the alveoli and back in again is known as dead space ventilation, which has the consequence that of the 500ml breathed into the alveoli with each breath only 350ml (500ml - 150ml = 350ml) is fresh warm and moistened air. Since this 350ml of fresh air is thoroughly mixed and diluted by the air that remains in the alveoli after normal exhalation (i.e. the functional residual capacity of about 2.5–3.0liters), {{it is clear that the}} composition of the <b>alveolar</b> <b>air</b> changes very little during the breathing cycle (see Fig. 9). The oxygen tension (or partial pressure) remains close to 13-14kPa (about 100mmHg), and that of carbon dioxide very close to 5.3kPa (or 40mmHg). This contrasts with composition of the dry outside air at sea level, where the partial pressure of oxygen is 21kPa (or 160mmHg) and that of carbon dioxide 0.04kPa (or 0.3mmHg).|$|E

25|$|The {{enlargement}} of the thoracic cavity's vertical dimension by the contraction of the diaphragm, and its two horizontal dimensions by {{the lifting of the}} front and sides of the ribs, causes the intrathoracic pressure to fall. The lungs' interiors are open to the outside air, and being elastic, therefore expand to fill the increased space. The inflow of air into the lungs occurs via the respiratory airways (Fig. 2). In health these airways (starting at the nose or mouth, and ending in the microscopic dead-end sacs called alveoli) are always open, though the diameters of the various sections can be changed by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The <b>alveolar</b> <b>air</b> pressure is therefore always close to atmospheric air pressure (about 100kPa at sea level) at rest, with the pressure gradients that cause air to move {{in and out of the}} lungs during breathing rarely exceeding 2–3kPa.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen has a {{very low}} {{solubility}} in water, and is therefore carried in the blood loosely combined with hemoglobin. The oxygen is held on the hemoglobin by four ferrous iron-containing heme groups per hemoglobin molecule. When all the heme groups carry one O2 molecule each the blood {{is said to be}} “saturated” with oxygen, and no further increase in the partial pressure of oxygen will meaningfully increase the oxygen concentration of the blood. Most of the carbon dioxide in the blood is carried as bicarbonate ions (HCO3−) in the plasma. However the conversion of dissolved CO2 into HCO3− (through the addition of water) is too slow for {{the rate at which the}} blood circulates through the tissues on the one hand, and through alveolar capillaries on the other. The reaction is therefore catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme inside the red blood cells. The reaction can go in both directions depending on the prevailing partial pressure of CO2. A small amount of carbon dioxide is carried on the protein portion of the hemoglobin molecules as carbamino groups. The total concentration of carbon dioxide (in the form of bicarbonate ions, dissolved CO2, and carbamino groups) in arterial blood (i.e. after it has equilibrated with the <b>alveolar</b> <b>air)</b> is about 26mM (or 58ml/100 ml), compared to the concentration of oxygen in saturated arterial blood of about 9mM (or 20ml/100 ml blood).|$|E

500|$|During heavy {{breathing}} as, for instance, during exercise, {{a large number}} of accessory muscles in the neck and abdomen are recruited. Exhalation, instead of being passive, is now caused by the rib cage being actively pulled downwards at the front and sides by the abdominal muscles. This has the effect of decreasing the size of the rib cage, and of pushing the abdominal organs up against the diaphragm which bulges into the thorax. The lung volume of air at the end of exhalation is now less than the resting FRC. However, the lungs cannot be emptied completely and in an adult human there is always still at least one litre of residual air left in the lungs after maximum exhalation. The FRC always remains in the alveoli after a normal out-breath. With each breath only about 350ml (i.e. less than 15%) of this <b>alveolar</b> <b>air</b> is expelled into the ambient air (with about 150ml [...] remaining behind in the airways, as [...] "dead space" [...] ventilation, as it is the first air to re-enter the alveoli on inhalation). This is immediately replaced with the same volume of fresh, but moistened, atmospheric air. It is therefore obvious that the 350ml inhaled fresh air is highly diluted by the 3litres of functional residual capacity air (i.e. the air that remains in the lungs after a normal exhalation), and that the composition of the <b>alveolar</b> <b>air</b> therefore changes very little under normal circumstances: the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen remains very close to 14kPa (105mmHg), and that of carbon dioxide varies minimally around 5.3kPa (40mmHg) throughout the respiratory cycle (of inhalation and exhalation).|$|E

Classical fluid mechanics theory excludes flow-induced mixing mechanisms because of the low Reynolds number nature of the acinar flow. For more than a decade, we have been challenging this classical view, proposing the idea that chaotic mixing is a potent mechanism in determining the transport of inhaled particles in the pulmonary acinus. We have demonstrated this in numerical simulations, experimental studies in both physical models and in animals, and mathematical modeling.

The key to understanding chaotic mixing is to identify two types of frequency in the system, each of which is induced by a different mechanism.

Dietary ZD plus DCA treatment induced mild hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia, increased cell proliferation index and COX- 2 protein expression in the oesophagus, and intranuclear inclusion, karyocytomegaly and microvesicular fatty change in the liver.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{review the}} {{etiology}} and pathophysiology of pneumomediastinum in severe blunt trauma, {{with a special}} interest in one of its possible origins, the Macklin effect. The Macklin effect relates to a three-step pathophysiologic process: blunt traumatic <b>alveolar</b> ruptures, <b>air</b> dissection along bronchovascular sheaths, and spreading of this blunt pulmonary interstitial emphysema into the mediastinum. The clinical relevance of the Macklin effect was also evaluated. SETTING: A university hospital serving as a reference trauma center. PATIENTS: A selection of 51 patients with severe blunt trauma between 1995 and 2000. Inclusion criteria: Severe trauma or high-speed deceleration justifying chest CT; if chest CT demonstrated a pneumomediastinum, bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy were performed to rule out tracheobronchial or esophageal injury. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients' clinical files, chest CT, and bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy reports. The Macklin effect was diagnosed when an air collection adjacent to a bronchus and a pulmonary vessel could be clearly identified on the chest CT. Clinical relevance of the Macklin effect was statistically evaluated regarding its repercussions on the pulmonary gas exchange function, the respective durations of intensive care and total hospital stay, and the associated injuries. RESULTS: Twenty (39 %) Macklin effects and 5 tracheobronchial injuries (10 %) were identified. One tracheobronchial injury occurred simultaneously with the Macklin effect. The presence of the Macklin effect affected neither the clinical profile nor the result of pulmonary gas analysis on hospital admission, but was associated with a significant (p < 0. 001) lengthening of the intensive care stay. CONCLUSIONS: The Macklin effect is present in 39 % of severe blunt traumatic pneumomediastinum detected by CT. Its identification does not rule out a tracheobronchial injury.

This blood gas barrier is extremely thin (in humans, on average, 2.2μm thick). It is folded into about 300 million small air sacs called alveoli (each between 75 and 300µm in diameter) branching off from the respiratory bronchioles in the lungs, thus providing an extremely large surface area (approximately 145m2) for gas exchange to occur.|$|E
2500|$|Other than recent drinking, {{the most}} common source of mouth alcohol is from belching or burping.

The American Medical Association concludes in its Manual for Chemical Tests for Intoxication (1959): [...] "True reactions with alcohol in expired breath from sources other than the <b>alveolar</b> <b>air</b> (eructation, regurgitation, vomiting) will, of course, vitiate the breath alcohol results."

2500|$|There is, however, a {{complication}} {{that increases}} the volume of air {{that needs to be}} inhaled per minute (respiratory minute volume) to provide the same amount of oxygen to the lungs at altitude as at sea level. During inhalation the air is warmed and saturated with water vapor during its passage through the nose passages and pharynx. Saturated water vapor pressure is dependent only on temperature. At a body core temperature of 37°C [...] it is 6.3kPa (47.0mmHg), irrespective of any other influences, including altitude. Thus at sea level, where the ambient atmospheric pressure is about 100kPa, the moistened air that flows into the lungs from the trachea consists of water vapor (6.3kPa), nitrogen (74.0kPa), oxygen (19.7kPa) and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases (a total of 100kPa). In dry air the partial pressure of O2 at sea level is 21.0kPa (i.e. 21% of 100kPa), compared to the 19.7kPa of oxygen entering the <b>alveolar</b> <b>air.</b> (The tracheal partial pressure of oxygen is 21% of [...] = 19.7kPa). [...] At the summit of Mt. Everest (at an altitude of 8,848m or 29,029ft) the total atmospheric pressure is 33.7kPa, of which 7.1kPa (or 21%) is oxygen. The air entering the lungs also has a total pressure of 33.7kPa, of which 6.3kPa is, unavoidably, water vapor (as it is at sea level). This reduces the partial pressure of oxygen entering the alveoli to 5.8kPa (or 21% of [...] = 5.8kPa). The reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air is therefore substantially greater than the reduction of the total atmospheric pressure at altitude would suggest (on Mt Everest: 5.8kPa vs. 7.1kPa).|$|E

Alternatively, air can diffuse directly after spine traumas (e. g., blunt deceleration with vertebral dislocation) or medical procedures. Several mechanisms could explain pneumomediastinum and pneumorachis after cocaine sniffing. Passive apnea and/or cough that occur after sniffing can cause intra alveolar hyper-pressure, {{which is responsible}} for <b>alveolar</b> rupture and <b>air</b> diffusion.

40|$|Factors {{regulating}} {{the release of}} phosphatidylcholine (PC) from neonatal-rat lungs were investigated. The {{results show that the}} release of prelabelled PC from the newborn-rat lung was augmented by air ventilation at the onset of breathing. This response was mimicked in lungs of pups delivered 1 day before term and allowed to breathe for different time intervals. Anoxia further augmented the ventilation-enhanced PC release from the newborn-rat lungs. The ventilation-induced release of PC was not abolished by the prior treatment of pups in utero or mothers in vivo with phenoxybenzamine, propranolol or atropine, suggesting the lack of receptor stimulation in the ventilation-enhanced PC release at birth. The results also show that ventilation stimulated [methyl- 14 C]choline incorporation into lung PC, presumably to replenish the depleted surfactant stores. The ratio of adenylate cyclase/cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activities, which reflects cyclic AMP levels in the developing rat lungs, did not change during the 120 min of air ventilation when the release of PC was much enhanced, implying that cyclic AMP may not be involved. This confirms our conclusion that stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptor was not involved in the air-ventilation-enhanced release of PC. Since the cell number or size did not change during 120 min of ventilation when the alveolar-cell surface was maximally distended, it is suggested that distension of <b>alveolar</b> wall by <b>air</b> ventilation at the onset of breathing may bring the lamellar bodies containing surfactant close to the luminal surface of alveolar type II cells, thereby enhancing their fusion and extrusion by exocytosis...|$|R

Yet, these pigs do not show any disease specific symptoms and are indistinguishable from uninfected pigs. Clinical signs such as breathing difficulties and wheezing, and indirect signs like decreased growth rate and overall lower food conversion efficiency are not specific and therefore seldom associated with ascariosis by the farmer. Although the presence of adult parasites in the small intestine might affect the pig’s productivity, {{it does not appear}} to affect the pig’s health significantly. The larval stages of this parasite on the other hand, do cause significant damage to the internal organs of its host in their attempt to successfully complete their hepatopulmonary migration.In the liver, the inflammatory reaction to this damage is manifested as the so-called ‘white spots’ that are visible {{on the surface of the}} liver. Hepatic white spots are the most characteristic lesions caused by migrating A. suum larvae in pigs. After larvae migrated through the liver, the destroyed liver cells are replaced by interlobular depositions of fibrous tissue and cellular infiltrates, producing the typical white spots. Three types of white spots have been described: compact and mesh-worked white spots both produced by eosinophilic interstitial hepatitis and the lymphonodular type spots caused by lymphofollicular hyperplasia. White spots appear as early as 3 days post infection and start to resolve after about 2-3 weeks post infection. As a result of this, livers can appear normal about 35 days after primary inoculation with Ascaris eggs. In order to complete their hepatopulmonary migration, larvae need to pass through the lungs as well. As these larvae move into the <b>alveolar</b> and bronchial <b>air</b> spaces they cause direct physical damage to the lungs. This can subsequently promote the development of pneumonia or pleurisy. The damage to the respiratory system can be recorded at the slaughterhouse and has been associated with the presence of Ascaris infection. It is obvious that the severity of the damage will depend on the amount of larvae that migrate through the lung [...] and that increased infection levels can easily cause respiratory distress and coughing. However, even after ingestion of high amounts of eggs, the A. suum infection itself very seldom causes lethal damage to the lung. It is rather the secondary, opportunistic, bacterial or viral infections that increase the chances of severe health problems.|$|R
