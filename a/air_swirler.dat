40|$|Blending of {{palm oil}} with {{petroleum}} derivatives and controlling the swirl flow strength and direction can overcome the poor physical properties of such fuel and enhance its spray atomization. In this work, {{evaluations of the}} blends with and without swirl flow were done by comparing their spray characteristics. Then they were compared with the spray characteristics of diesel fuel. The objectives of this research are to {{study the effects of}} blending ratios on the spray characteristics and to evaluate the effects of swirling flow on the spray characteristics. Two new designs of <b>air</b> <b>swirlers</b> were found to be capable of producing variable swirl flow strengths and directions. To characterize the spray of the Refined, Bleached, Deodorized Palm Oil (RBDPO) /diesel blends under different swirl strengths and directions, five blends of B 5, B 10, B 15, B 20 and B 25 were physically blended on volume basis. The physical properties of the blends were experimentally and analytically determined. A Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) was used to measure the droplet size while direct photography was used to measure the spray angle. The Lagrangian Dispersed Phase Model (DPM) was used to simulate the spray of the various RPDPO/diesel blends in an unconfined domain. The three dimensional spray CFD model was first validated for the case of diesel spray with the experimental results. The validated model was then used to characterize the spray of RPDPO/diesel blends. The results showed that when the volume blending ratio increased to 0. 25 (B 25), the percentage increase in Sauter mean diameter (SMD) was 57. 25 % and percentage decrease in spray angle was 12. 23 % compared to the diesel fuel. The results also showed that when the swirl number increased from 0. 654 to 1. 57, a reduction of 46. 39 % in SMD was achieved with the improvement in the particle dispersion. In addition the results showed that when the direction of swirled air stream changed from co-rotating flows to the counter-rotating flows, the SMD was reduced by 13. 99 % with better spatially dispersed spray due to the increase in the shear layers produced and the improved turbulent mixing. The findings suggest that the two blends B 5 and B 10 were comparable with diesel in terms of fuel physical properties and spray characteristics. It was also found that the optimum swirl number for B 15 is 1. 273, which resulted in 36. 9 % reduction in SMD. This meant that this swirl number produced comparable spray characteristics to diesel spray for blend B 15, and higher blends needed higher swirl numbers.

This 7 -point LDI configuration has a circular cross section, with a center ("pilot") fuel-air mixer surrounded by six outer ("main") fuel-air mixers. Each fuel-air mixer {{consists of an}} axial <b>air</b> <b>swirler</b> followed by a converging-diverging venturi. A simplex fuel injector is inserted {{through the center of}} the <b>air</b> <b>swirler,</b> with the fuel injector tip located near the venturi throat. All 7 fuel-air mixers are identical except for the swirler blade angle. In the 'all- 60 ' configuration, the swirler blade angle was 60 deg for all fuel-air mixers. In the ' 45 - 60 ' configuration, the swirler blade angle was 60 deg on the center and 45 deg on the outer fuel-air mixers. Testing was done in a 5 -atm flame tube with inlet air temperatures from 630 to 830 F and equivalence ratios from 0. 2 to 0. 7. Combustion dynamics were measured using a cooled PCB pressure transducer flush-mounted in the wall of the combustor test section. Both configurations had large pressure fluctuations (greater than 2 psi peak-peak) near 730 Hz, the quarter-wave frequency. The all- 60 configuration also had large pressure fluctuations near 1170 Hz; the 45 - 60 configuration did not. The 45 - 60 configuration had large pressure fluctuations near 480 Hz; the all- 60 configuration did not...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} an experimentally validated modelling {{study of the}} flow of combustion air in an industrial radiant tube burner (RTB). The RTB is used typically in industrial heat treating furnaces. The work has been initiated because of the need for improvements in burner lifetime and performance which are related to the fluid mechanics of the com busting flow, and a fundamental understanding of this is therefore necessary. To achieve this, a detailed three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model has been used, validated with experimental air flow, temperature and flue gas measurements. Initially, the work programme is presented and the theory behind RTB design and operation in addition to the theory behind swirling flows and methane combustion. NOx reduction techniques are discussed and numerical modelling of combusting flows is detailed in this section. The importance of turbulence, radiation and combustion modelling is highlighted, as well as the numerical schemes that incorporate discretization, finite volume theory and convergence. The study first focuses on the combustion air flow and its delivery to the combustion zone. An isothermal computational model was developed to allow the examination of the flow characteristics as it enters the burner and progresses through the various sections prior to the discharge face in the combustion area. Important features identified include the <b>air</b> recuperator <b>swirler</b> coil, the step ring, the primary/secondary air splitting flame tube and the fuel nozzle. It was revealed that the effectiveness of the <b>air</b> recuperator <b>swirler</b> is significantly compromised by the need for a generous assembly tolerance. Also, there is a substantial circumferential flow maldistribution introduced by the swirier, but that this is effectively removed by the positioning of a ring constriction in the downstream passage. Computations using the k-ε turbulence model show good agreement with experimentally measured velocity profiles in the combustion zone and proved the use of the modelling strategy prior to the combustion study. Reasonable mesh independence was obtained with 200, 000 nodes. Agreement was poorer with the RNG  k-ε and Reynolds Stress models. The study continues to address the combustion process itself and the heat transfer process internal to the RTB. A series of combustion and radiation model configurations were developed and the optimum combination of the Eddy Dissipation (ED) combustion model and the Discrete Transfer (DT) radiation model was used successfully to validate a burner experimental test. The previously cold flow validated k-ε turbulence model was used and reasonable mesh independence was obtained with 300, 000 nodes. The combination showed good agreement with temperature measurements in the inner and outer walls of the burner, as well as with flue gas composition measured at the exhaust. The inner tube wall temperature predictions validated the experimental measurements in the largest portion of the thermocouple locations, highlighting a small flame bias to one side, although the model slightly over predicts the temperatures towards the downstream end of the inner tube. NOx emissions were initially over predicted, however, the use of a combustion flame temperature limiting subroutine allowed convergence to the experimental value of 451 ppmv. With the validated model, the effectiveness of certain RTB features identified previously is analysed, and an analysis of the energy transfers throughout the burner is presented, to identify the dominant mechanisms in each region. The optimum turbulence-combustion-radiation model selection was then the baseline for further model development. One of these models, an eccentrically positioned flame tube model highlights the failure mode of the RTB during long term operation. Other models were developed to address NOx reduction and improvement of the flame profile in the burner combustion zone. These included a modified fuel nozzle design, with 12 circular section fuel ports, which demonstrates a longer and more symmetric flame, although with limited success in NOx reduction. In addition, a zero bypass swirler coil model was developed that highlights the effect of the stronger swirling combustion flow. A reduced diameter and a 20 mm forward displaced flame tube model shows limited success in NOx reduction; although the latter demonstrated improvements in the discharge face heat distribution and improvements in the flame symmetry. Finally, Flue Gas Recirculation (FGR) modelling attempts indicate the difficulty of the application of this NOx reduction technique in the Wellman RTB. Recommendations for further work are made that include design mitigations for the fuel nozzle and further burner modelling is suggested to improve computational validation. The introduction of fuel staging is proposed, as well as a modification in the inner tube to enhance the effect of FGR...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Swirling jet {{is used as}} a {{means of}} {{controlling}} flames in combustion chamber. Swirl flow offer an interesting field of study for aerospace & mechanical engineers in general and for combustion engineers in particular since it involves complex interaction of recirculation & turbulent mixing, which aid flame stabilization in combustion system. Swirling flow in both reacting & non-reacting conditions occur in wide range of application such as gas turbines, marine combustor burner, chemical processing plants, rotary kilns & spray dryers. Stabilization of flame can be achieved by various techniques. The most common techniques used in modern gas turbine combustors is swirl stabilization in which swirl velocity is imparted to inlet <b>air</b> using vane <b>Swirler.</b> Swirl can reduce combustion length by producing higher rates of entrainment of ambient fluid and fast mixing close to exit nozzle & on boundaries of recirculation zone in strongly swirling zones. Experimental studies show that swirl has large – scale effect on flow fields: jet growth, entrainment & decay and flame size, shape, stability & combustion intensity are affected by degree of swirl imparted to the flow, therefore swirling flows are commonly used to improve & control mixing process. This work present design of combustion chamber. Swirler applicable for producing CRZ (Central Recirculating Zone) to control length & stability of flame. Whole assembly design includes inlet pipes, Swirler, diffuser, expansion chamber, and tailpipe. The core objective {{of this study is to}} present the details of the experimental swirl flow.
