5|$|Joseph Sachs {{had also}} invented an {{electric}} fire engine vehicle {{consisting of a}} wagon on which a spring-supported platform held <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> which operated two rotary water pumps. The motor was supplied with a reel of electric cable {{and it could be}} regulated from either side of the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 it {{was decided}} to {{preserve}} the two remaining engines and incorporate them as the central feature in the Visitor Centre, including a Museum in the old boiler house, which opened in 1988 and attracts over 30,000 visitors a year. The flywheel is now driven by <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> The pumping station is now a Grade II* listed building, while the gothic-style meter house is Grade II listed and used as a bat sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV or PHV), also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid {{electric vehicle}} with rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional {{hybrid electric vehicle}} and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to explain the {{construction}} of motors in car technology. We can acquaint more {{with the construction of}} <b>a</b> DC <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> Then we will deal more with <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> starters, <b>an</b> innovation of <b>a</b> DC <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> or with its replacing for AC <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with other poles...|$|R
25|$|Most <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> operate {{through the}} {{interaction}} between <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor's</b> magnetic field and winding currents to generate force. In certain applications, such as in regenerative braking with traction motors in the transportation industry, <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> {{can also be used}} in reverse as generators to convert mechanical energy into electric power.|$|R

5|$|The {{change to}} an AC system was a {{significant}} improvement. The Vulcan's powered flying controls were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> Because there was no manual reversion, a total electrical failure {{would result in a}} loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually the {{interior of}} a street-capable Tumbler. The cockpit was oversized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the Tumbler was a miniature model that was 1:6 scale of the actual Tumbler. This miniature model had <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the actual Tumbler was used for the waterfall sequence.|$|E
5|$|A Leslie speaker {{consists}} {{of a number of}} individual components. The audio signal enters the amplifier from the instrument. Once amplified, the signal travels to an audio crossover, which splits it into separate frequency bands that can be individually routed to each loudspeaker. Different models have different combinations of speakers, but the most common model, the 122, {{consists of}} a single woofer for bass and a single compression driver and acoustic horn for treble. The audio emitted by the speakers is isolated inside an enclosure, aside from a number of outlets that lead towards either a rotating horn or drum. <b>An</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> rotates both horn and drum at a constant speed.|$|E

5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an attractive force on a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of light (relativistic).|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going {{all the time to}} boil the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In the case of <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E

5000|$|The Hybrid Tourer concept {{featured}} a 2.0-litre horizontally-opposed ("Boxer") direct-injection turbocharged gasoline engine driving {{the front wheels}} through the continuously variable transmission (CVT, which Subaru branded [...] "Lineartronic"). The gasoline engine could also provide electric generation by turning <b>a</b> [...] <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> and the rear axle was powered by <b>a</b> second [...] <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> The Hybrid Tourer was an evolution of Subaru's prior B5-TPH concept, which used a [...] "Turbo Parallel Hybrid" [...] (TPH) drivetrain where <b>a</b> single <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> was integrated between the gasoline engine and the transmission.|$|R

25|$|<b>An</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> is an {{electrical}} machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. The reverse {{of this is}} the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy and is done by an electric generator, which has much in common with a motor.|$|E

25|$|An {{automobile}} self-starter is <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> that initiates {{rotational motion}} in an {{internal combustion engine}} before it can power itself, therefore eliminating the hand crank used to start engines. In 1911, Charles F. Kettering invented the automobile self-starter while working at National Cash Register and then sold them for installation on cars at the Cadillac company. There had been many attempts at producing an electric starter before, {{but none of them}} were successful. Most designs at that time called for the use of <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> attached to the engine's flywheel. However, in order to fit in the car's engine compartment, the device would have to be small, and therefore it would be unable to produce a sufficient enough amount of torque.|$|E
25|$|The EV {{is based}} on the 2LT model, and adds unique alloy wheels with black-painted accents, replaces the I4 engine and 6-speed {{automatic}} transmission with <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> a fixed, 3.87 ratio reduction gear, and closes off the front grill due to being entirely electric.|$|E
