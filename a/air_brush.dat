2500|$|The first {{instrument}} {{to be named}} the [...] "paint distributor" [...] was developed by Abner Peeler [...] "for the painting of watercolors and other artistic purposes" [...] and used a hand-operated compressor to supply continuous air. It was rather crude, being based {{on a number of}} spare parts in a jeweller's workshop such as old screwdrivers and welding torches. It took 4 years of further development before a working prototype was developed by Liberty Walkup of Mt. Morris, Illinois. [...] Walkup repatented the work under the name of [...] "air-brush", a name his wife Phoebe Walkup came up with. Thus the formal birth of the name 'Air Brush' can be traced to a stakeholders meeting of the new <b>Air</b> <b>Brush</b> Manufacturing Co. at 7pm on 6 October 1883, and the name was formally born. His wife would later go on to be the founder of the Illinois Art School where airbrushing was taught to students from all over the world. [...] In that same rented 4 story building Rockford Air-Brush would be established under Liberty Walkup. [...] The Walkups taught airbrush technique to American Impressionist master Wilson Irvine at the <b>Air</b> <b>Brush</b> School in Rockford, Illinois. The first certain 'atomising' type airbrush was invented by Charles Burdick in 1893 and presented by Thayer and Chandler art materials company at the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. [...] Burdick founded the Fountain Brush Company in the US, and launched the first series of airbrushes onto the market. This device was essentially the same as a modern airbrush, resembling a pen and working in a different manner than Peeler's device. [...] Aerograph, Burdick's original company, still makes and sells airbrushes in England. Thayer and Chandler were acquired by Badger Air-Brush Co. in 2000. Badger Air-Brush continues the Thayer and Chandler tradition of manufacturing quality airbrush guns, tools and compressors out of Franklin Park, Illinois.|$|E

50|$|Scratchboard itself comes {{either with}} a paper (cardboard) backing, or a {{hardboard}} support. While the cardboard does have its uses, {{as it can be}} easily cut into size, the hardboard is much superior, giving greater stability to the work, being able to be corrected more often. It is more durable and easier to scratch into for cleaner, crisper details and lines. Several tools have been created specifically for scratchboard; however any sharp implement will do though a range of blades of different thicknesses allows the removal of more or less of the ink at will (see variety of tools listed below). Isopropyl Alcohol on a cotton swab or cotton ball, sandpaper and non-oily, fine, steel wool are also useful for removing large areas, and creating texture. Coloring scratchboard, black or white boards, can be done with many mediums applied with paint brush, <b>air</b> <b>brush,</b> and even cotton balls. Special scratchboard colored inks, made by ampersand, can be added to the white areas and then scratched again for additional highlights and volume for added dimension.|$|E
5000|$|After leaving school, Francis Edgar Stanley {{married a}} woman {{by the name}} of Augusta May Walker (1848-1927) and opened a {{portrait}} studio. His first technique was [...] "crayon" [...] or charcoal which he supplemented with his [...] "Improvement to the Atomizer," [...] a forerunner of the modern <b>air</b> <b>brush</b> which he patented in 1876. In 1882, Francis began experimenting with photography for which he quickly developed an affinity. Following the tragic conflagration of his brother's factory, Francis suggested that the two work together to develop a new photographic product. By 1885, the Stanley brothers had established the Stanley Dry Plate Company in Lewiston, Maine. The first primitive dry photo plate was invented by the English physician Richard Leach Maddox in 1871. Charles Bennett discovered important improvements upon the original formula but, ten years later, most photographers were still using the wet plate collodion process. By perfecting their factory process and marketing their product across the country, the Stanley Company quickly rose to predominance {{at a time when the}} market for factory—made (rather than studio—made) photo materials was just opening. The brothers quickly amassed a small fortune and, in 1890, they moved to Newton, Massachusetts.|$|E

50|$|The main {{drafting}} sets of four nibs came in two kinds: Gold and Silver. The Silver was for rough tracing paper, and the Gold was for {{plastic film}} (velograph or durables). Drawing boards changed {{as a result}} of technical pens—a hard (not spongy) surface was required, and when plastic film was used, the static attraction between plastic cursors, T-squares, set-squares etc. meant that as one lifted the edge from the film, the film would rise through static attraction and the ink would blot. The solution was to stick down a plastic sheet (Osalid) that attracted the film more strongly than the drafting instruments. The tracing paper or velograph sheet would be placed on the Osalid sheet stuck onto the drawing board and the <b>air</b> <b>brushed</b> away. Brushing charged the surface, and the film would then be taped taut (but released {{at the end of each}} working day to allow for overnight temperature expansions and contractions).|$|R
5000|$|Arnold Belkin {{has been}} {{referred}} to as the “Canadian son of Mexican muralism.” He {{is best known for his}} murals such as those at Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana in Iztapalapa. [...] There are thirty murals of the artist still in existence in Mexico, Nicaragua and the United States. He is credited with continuing the Mexican muralism tradition in the mid-20th century when the Generación de la Ruptura headed by artists like José Luis Cuevas and Rafael Coronel were taking the Mexican art scene away from muralism and its Marxist tendencies. Most of his murals are in public and educational spaces keeping the tradition of murals as a way to communicate with the masses and the following generations keeping murals an important part of Mexican culture. From the muralist generation, Belkin not only learned traditional painting techniques but also new ones, influenced by the work of Siqueiros. This included painting with <b>air</b> <b>brushes</b> and creating images using photographs projected on a wall as a base.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this work}} a new method is {{presented}} to efficiently produce hydrogel scaffolds reinforced with nanofibers to show enhanced mechanical properties and improved structural integrity. The method {{is based on a}} combination of <b>air</b> <b>brush</b> spraying of a hydrogel and electrospinning of nanofibers. With <b>air</b> <b>brush</b> spraying the controllability is enhanced and the potential for scale-up increased. The developed method was used to successfully reinforce gellan gum hydrogels with electrospun polycaprolactone nanofib-ers. Optical and rheological evaluations were performed and showed that parameters such as the amount of incorporated nanofibers, gellan gum concentration and calcium chloride (crosslinker) concentrations could be used to modulate material properties. Incorpo-ration of a small amount of nanofibers had a reinforcing effect and resulted in a hydrogel with rheological properties similar to the human nucleus pulposus (NP). The method is flexible and carries potential for designing scaffolds for e. g. NP tissue regeneration...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} considers whether traditional {{approaches to}} easel paintings conservation {{are appropriate for}} the treatment of <b>air</b> <b>brush</b> paintings. The objectives were: -To investigate the aesthetic and technical history of the airbrush -To investigate surface changes in paint layers -To investigate the appropriateness of traditional conservation treatments for airbrush paintings and evaluate alternative approaches Although the first airbrush was introduced in 1883 it was initially rejected by many fine art circles as being too ‘mechanical’. Airbrush techniques have been little discussed in the field of fine art and the field of the conservation of fine art. A mixed methodology was followed for this research, qualitative through literature review carried out in line with the interdisciplinary nature of the research, and quantitative through various approaches including surveys. One survey was carried out in order to establish the use of <b>air</b> <b>brush</b> techniques by artists and its eventual acceptance as a fine art technique. A second survey was conducted to discover how well conservators understood the degradation characteristics of <b>air</b> <b>brush</b> paintings and their appropriate treatment. The research revealed that much of the eventual success of <b>air</b> <b>brush</b> painting resulted from the introduction of new types of paint in order to better manage the technique. It also revealed that there was a high level of uncertainty amongst practitioners in the field of paintings conservation with regard to the deterioration characteristics of <b>air</b> <b>brush</b> painting or their appropriate resolution. However the major concern with regard to conservation lay clearly within the field of image re-integration {{as a result of its}} characteristically smooth surface finish. Artificial light ageing was carried out on simulated mock ups in order to develop a clearer understanding of the type of surface changes that might be expected over time from a limited palette of colours. This was followed by technical visual examination and media analysis via FTIR and Py- GC-MS methods. It was found that there were changes in surface morphology in some colours, which appeared to further enhance the smooth surface finish of the paint layer. A range of approaches to image re-integration were trialled ranging from the traditional paint based approaches to the use of digital coloured light. The latter was of particular interest in offering a truly reversible none interventive approach to re-integration. The focus of the digital re-integration techniques was to evaluate the viability of its use in general practice. Due to the smooth surface as well as the build-up of multiple layers of colour the traditional approaches proved difficult to harmonise within the picture plain. The use of digital approaches using coloured light was more successful although further research is required in order to develop this approach for wide spread professional practice. The physical and chemical characteristics of the airbrushed paint layer present issues that are fundamentally different to those found in oil paintings. As yet these are not all fully understood and require further research. Until such time the use of none interventive, reversible image re-integration techniques such as coloured light would be recommended...|$|E

Silica suspension was coated onto the glass substrate by the <b>air</b> <b>brushing</b> methods. This method can deposit a uniform, transparent coating on the glass substrate efficiently. Diluting the precursor by adding ethanol or a mixture of D. I. water and ethanol further improved the transmittance and superhydrophobicity efficiency. The results showed that as the silica particle concentration and {{the thickness of the}} coating were increased, the surface roughness was enhanced. Rougher surface displayed a higher superhydrophobicity and lower transmittance. Therefore, the concentration of silica particle, volume of coatings, and the ratio of ethanol and D.
