40|$|When a test {{of working}} memory (WM) {{requires}} the retention of multiple items, a subset {{of them can be}} prioritized. Recent studies have shown that, although prioritized (i. e., attended) items are associated with <b>active</b> neural <b>representations,</b> unprioritized (i. e., unattended) memory items can be retained in WM despite the absence of such <b>active</b> <b>representations,</b> and with no decrement in their recognition if they are cued later in the trial. These findings raise two intriguing questions {{about the nature of the}} short-term retention of information outside the focus of attention. First, when the focus of attention shifts from items in WM, is there a loss of fidelity for those unattended memory items? Second, could the retention of unattended memory items be accomplished by long-term memory mechanisms? We addressed the first question by comparing the precision of recall of attended versus unattended memory items, and found a significant decrease in precision for unattended memory items, reflecting a degradation in the quality of those representations. We addressed the second question by asking subjects to perform a WM task, followed by a surprise memory test for the items that they had seen in the WM task. Long-term memory for unattended memory items from the WM task was not better than memory for items that had remained selected by the focus of attention in the WM task. These results show that unattended WM representations are degraded in quality and are not preferentially represented in long-term memory, as compared to attended memory items...|$|R

However, noncommutativity of a product creates a new picture. Instead of one type {{of a system of}} linear equations, we have four different types. To find a solution of different types of systems of linear equations we need to extend the definition of a quasideterminant given in [1, 2] and introduce two different types of a quasideterminant. As in the commutative case, solutions of a system of linear equations build up right or left module depending on type of system. We study modules together with the system of linear equations because their properties have a close relationship. As in a commutative case, the group of automorphisms of a module has a single transitive representation on a frame manifold. This gives us an opportunity to introduce passive and <b>active</b> <b>representations.</b> Studying a module over a skew-field uncovers new details in the relationship between passive and active transformations, makes this picture more clear. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} hold {{information}} briefly in mind {{in the absence of}} external stimulation forms the core of much of higher-order cognition. This ability is referred to as short-term memory (STM). However, single-term labels such as this belie the complexity of the underlying construct. Here, we review evidence that STM is an amalgamation of three qualitatively distinct states. We argue that these distinct states emerge from the combination of frontal selection mechanisms (often considered the domain of attention and cognitive control), medial temporal binding mechanisms (often considered the domain of long-term memory, LTM), and synaptic plasticity. These various contributions lead to a single representation amenable to elaborated processing (focus of attention), a limited set of <b>active</b> <b>representations</b> among which attention can be flexibly switched (direct-access region), and passive representations whose residual traces facilitate re-activation (activated LTM). We suggest that selection and binding mechanisms are typically engaged simultaneously, providing multiple forms and routes of short-term maintenance. We propose that such a framework can resolve discrepancies among recent studies that have attempted to understand the relationship between attention and STM on the one hand, an...|$|R

The studies were done to see if these bureaucracies are truly representative of the social groups that make up their citizenry. According to one survey there are great differences in the way black and white administrators and citizens view different issues.

40|$|A {{model of}} {{consciousness}} and hypnosis is presented {{which has its}} origins {{in a series of}} neuropsychological studies on the role of neocortex in associative learning and memory in animals. It is essentially an evolutionary and hierarchical description of increasingly more sophisticated levels of information processing in vertebrate brains which places the more recently evolved systems that are associated with subjective experience into a more meaningful perspective. With the evolution of representa-tional systems (consciousness systems) with the capacity for parallel processing a need was created for an executive control system to prioritize some currently <b>active</b> <b>representations</b> as the basis for action, particularly in novel situations. Consequently, a major function of the executive control system is in the re-representation of a selected subset of these representations for further processing in a subsystem (self-awareness system) with priority access to action. Representations that enter the latter subsystem constitute the contents of our subjective experience. In hypnosis, it is argued, influence is exerted through the executive control system to orchestrate the re-representation of information into the self-awareness system and hence to influ-ence the nature of subjective experience. Important among the pressures acting on the executive control system are those identified by sociocognitive theories as capable of influencing hypnotic enactment and experience. Key words: hypnosis, consciousness, self-awareness, executive control system, neuropsychology, neo-stat...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis opinion article explores how {{sustained}} neural firing {{in association}} areas allows high-order mental representations to be coactivated over multiple perception-action cycles, permitting sequential mental states to share overlapping content and thus be recursively interrelated. The term “state-spanning coactivity” (SSC) is introduced {{to refer to}} neural nodes that remain coactive as a group over a given period of time. SSC ensures that contextual groupings of goal or motor-relevant representations will demonstrate continuous activity over a delay period. It also allows potentially related representations to accumulate and coactivate despite delays between their initial appearances. The nodes that demonstrate SSC are {{a subset of the}} <b>active</b> <b>representations</b> from the previous state, and can act as referents to which newly introduced representations of succeeding states relate. Coactive nodes pool their spreading activity, converging on and activating new nodes, adding these to the remaining nodes from the previous state. Thus, the overall distribution of coactive nodes in cortical networks evolves gradually during contextual updating. The term “incremental change in state-spanning coactivity” (icSSC) is introduced to refer to this gradual evolution. Because a number of associated representations can be sustained continuously, each brain state is embedded recursively in the previous state, amounting to an iterative process that can implement learned algorithms to progress toward a complex result. The longer representations are sustained, the more successive mental states can share related content, exhibit progressive qualities, implement complex algorithms, and carry thematic or narrative continuity. Included is a discussion of the implications that SSC and icSSC may have for understanding working memory, defining consciousness, and constructing AI architectures...|$|R
