5|$|The {{polynomial}} Euclidean algorithm {{has other}} applications, such as Sturm chains, {{a method for}} counting the zeros of a polynomial that lie inside a given real interval.

5|$|Because of its low {{reproductive}} rate and historically documented declines in <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean, the night shark has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the American Fisheries Society (AFS). A population assessment {{has indicated that}} this species is secure in the waters off the United States, but {{this may not be}} true elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|However some {{research}} shows that black carbon will increase global warming, being second only to CO2. They believe that soot will absorb solar energy and transport it to other <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Himalayas where glacial melting occurs. It can also darken Arctic ice reducing reflectivity and increasing absorption of solar radiation.|$|E

5|$|In {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, {{the electrons}} removed from organic molecules in <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> protagon acid cycle are transferred to oxygen {{and the energy}} released is used to make ATP. This is done in eukaryotes {{by a series of}} proteins in the membranes of mitochondria called the electron transport chain. In prokaryotes, these proteins are found in the cell's inner membrane. These proteins use the energy released from passing electrons from reduced molecules like NADH onto oxygen to pump protons across a membrane.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s the {{financial}} services sector became a major employer {{in the city and}} surrounding <b>areas,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> business parks on the northern fringe of what was now referred to as Greater Bristol or the Bristol Urban Area comprising the city, Easton-in-Gordano, Frampton Cottrell and Winterbourne, Kingswood, Mangotsfield and Stoke Gifford. High technology companies such as IBM, Hewlett Packard, Toshiba, and Orange, along with creative and media enterprises become significant local employers as traditional manufacturing industries declined.|$|E

5|$|Life in a workhouse was {{intended}} to be harsh, to deter the able-bodied poor and to ensure that only the truly destitute would apply. But in <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> provision of free medical care and education for children, neither of which was available to the poor in England living outside workhouses until the early 20th century, workhouse inmates were advantaged over the general population, a dilemma that the Poor Law authorities never managed to reconcile.|$|E
5|$|The National Park Service {{originally}} prohibited Capital Bikeshare stations on {{the property}} it manages, including large <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> National Mall.

The first two of five approved Capital Bikeshare stations opened on the National Mall on March 16, 2012, shortly {{before the start of the}} 2012 National Cherry Blossom Festival.|$|E
5|$|The {{flag was}} {{a tool of}} Japanese imperialism in the {{occupied}} Southeast Asian areas during Second World War: people {{had to use the}} flag, and schoolchildren sang Kimigayo in morning flag raising ceremonies. Local flags were allowed for some <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Philippines, Indonesia, and Manchukuo. In Korea which was part of the Empire of Japan, the Hinomaru and other symbols were used to declare that the Koreans were subjects of the empire.|$|E

5|$|A {{part of the}} South Downs, Willingdon Down is a {{designated}} Site of Special Scientific Interest. This is of archaeological interest due to a Neolithic camp and burial grounds. The area is also a nationally uncommon tract of chalk grassland rich in species. Another SSSI which partially falls with the Eastbourne district is Seaford to Beachy Head. This site, of biological and geological interest, covers the coastline between Eastbourne and Seaford, plus the Seven Sisters country park and the Cuckmere valley. Several nature trails lead across the Downs to <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> nearby villages of East Dean and Birling Gap, and landmarks like the Seven Sisters, Belle Tout lighthouse and Beachy Head.|$|E
5|$|Around {{a quarter}} of the common impala populations occur in {{protected}} <b>areas,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Okavango Delta (Botswana); Masai Mara and Kajiado (Kenya); Kruger National Park (South Africa); the Ruaha and Serengeti National Parks and Selous Game Reserve (Tanzania); Luangwa Valley (Zambia); Hwange, Sebungwe and Zambezi Valley (Zimbabwe). The rare black-faced impala has been introduced into private farms in Namibia and the Etosha National Park. Population densities vary largely from place to place; from less than one impala per square kilometre in Mkomazi National Park (Tanzania) to as high as 135 per square kilometre near Lake Kariba (Zimbabwe).|$|E
5|$|Ashdod {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} industrial centers in Israel. All industrial activities in the city are located in northern <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> port area, the northern industrial zone, and around the Lachish River. The port of Ashdod is the largest port in Israel, handling about 60% of Israel's port cargo. It was mainly upgraded in recent years and will be able to provide berths for Panamax ships. Various shipping companies offices are also located in the port area which also is home to an Eshkol A power station and coal terminal.|$|E

5|$|Currently, {{there are}} over 200 exotic species known to live in Redwood National and State Parks. Of these thirty have been {{identified}} as invasive species, ten of these are considered threats to local species and ecosystems. Exotic species currently account for {{about a quarter of the}} total flora in the parks. Only about one percent of plant growth in old-growth areas are of exotic species, while <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Bald Hills prairies have a relative cover of fifty to seventy-five percent exotic. The type of foreign vegetation also varies, with plants such as the English Ivy (Hedera helix), Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), and the Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum). The spotted knapweed and poison hemlock are both under consideration for addition to a high priority watch list maintained by the park system.|$|E
5|$|Fisher wanted {{additional}} Commonwealth {{power in}} certain <b>areas,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> nationalisation of monopolies. A constitutional referendum was initiated in 1911 which aimed {{to increase the}} federal government's legislative powers over trade and commerce and over monopolies. Both questions were defeated, with around 61 per cent voting 'No'. The Fisher government made another attempt, holding a referendum in 1913 which asked for greater federal powers over trade and commerce, corporations, industrial matters, trusts, monopolies, and railway disputes. All six questions were defeated, with around 51 per cent voting 'No'. At the 1913 election, the Commonwealth Liberal Party, led by Joseph Cook, defeated the Labor Party by a single seat.|$|E
5|$|Found on or {{near the}} bottom, the blackmouth {{catshark}} favors a muddy habitat. There is little evidence for segregation by sex. A number of studies in the northern and western Mediterranean have reported that adults occur deeper than juveniles. Other studies though have found no such pattern. It is possible that <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> waters off southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages. Another explanation with some scientific support is that adults are most common at intermediate depths, while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in deeper water. If true, the age-depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling.|$|E
