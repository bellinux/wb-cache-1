5|$|Paper Trail {{is a free}} {{downloadable}} content (DLC) with alternate reality game features. The {{story is}} split into six parts, with the first being available after reaching <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the main story. Each subsequent part was made available each Friday from March 28, 2014 in North America and, concluding {{with the release of}} the final part on April 25, 2014.|$|E
5|$|When {{a charge}} {{is placed in}} a {{location}} with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential at <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> space, which {{is equal to the}} work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.|$|E
5|$|Key {{elements}} in the game are negotiation with and the fusion and creation of demons. Encountered in battle, demons can be talked with and negotiated into running from the battle, giving money or items, or joining the player's party. If the negotiation fails, the demon will attack. Once a demon is won over, they are given a loyalty meter which {{is influenced by the}} player's actions. If the demon is treated well and performs actions in battle it approves of, its loyalty will increase. If the opposite occurs, the demon will begin to disobey the protagonist, then leave. Demons can be fused together at a special location in the game called the Hotel Goumaden, where fusions are supervised by the NPC Dr. Victor. Demon fusion is governed by a comparability system, with more favorable fusions emerging from better demon compatibility. Demons can also be fused with weapons to grant stat boosts, and after <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the game artificial demons called Zomas can be used and strengthened through repeated fusions.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{important}} {{locations are}} {{located within the}} world: these include Terminals that give access to a fast travel system; the Junk Shop, which acts as a vendor for buying and selling items; Rag's Jewelry, where gems collected during gameplay can be traded for rare items and unique demons; and the Fountain of Life, where the Protagonist and other party members can receive treatment for ailments, heal them of damage, or revive characters knocked out in battle. An optional location separate from the Vortex World is the Amala Labyrinth, accessed after the Protagonist has reached <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the story. The Labyrinth is a dungeon divided into multiple floors or Kalpa, each housing both demon enemies and brokers which sell demons to the Protagonist. Each Kalpa is connected by a Warp Zone, in which the Protagonist can collect currency and items while avoiding or destroying obstacles. Proceeding through the levels of the Labyrinth requires the protagonist to find and fight Fiends carrying Candelabra, which unlock barriers. The Candelabra also act {{as a means of}} locating and either engaging or avoiding Fiends.|$|E
5|$|To create Lou Bloom's character, Gilroy {{explored}} {{the ideas of}} unemployment and capitalism. He wanted to portray Lou as someone who perpetually focuses on the precepts of capitalism, and how these thoughts not only give him sanity, but also push him over the edge. Gilroy did not give Lou a character arc, as he believed that people develop their ideals at <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> their life, and that they stay that way regardless of what happens. This is depicted in the opening scene of the film, when Lou attacks a security guard, which informs the audience that Lou is a criminal, and not someone who lost their morality {{as a result of}} the job. Lou's backstory was purposefully left out of the script, as Gilroy felt that without one, the audience would create their own backstories for Lou, and become more engaged with the character. Gilroy remarked that Lou eventually became a vehicle for the ideas and themes that he wanted to express in the film.|$|E
5|$|Ampelosaurus {{seems to}} {{have grown in a}} way similar to more basal sauropods. After <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> its development, the {{microscopic}} material of the bone became very different from more basal Sauropoda. Ampelosaurus grew more slowly once the bone microstructure became unique among sauropods. Although Diplodocoidea and basal Macronaria also show an increase in bone growth and a decrease in growth rate around the presumed onset of sexual maturity, it is much more gradual than Ampelosaurus. The process of growing, which in other sauropods started around sexual maturity, was clearly delayed in Ampelosaurus. The period of growth after sexual maturity seems to be shortened in Ampelosaurus and is dominated by slow bone building instead of fast growth. Growth marks are generally rare in sauropods or appearing only late in ontogeny, if at all. The lack of growth marks is suggestive of fast and continuous growth in sauropods, which supports the hypothesis that they achieved large body size through because of fast growth. Ampelosaurus does not show growth marks on any bone sample. This is unusual to be found with the apparently reduced growth rate and high level of bone growth seen in it, as those features are often associated with the occurrence of growth marks.|$|E

5|$|Bravely Default is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) {{which features}} a party of four characters navigating the fantasy world of Luxendarc. Navigation in towns, dungeons and the world map environments are done from an angled, third-person overhead view: the character remains still, the camera zooms out to a distant view. These environments are displayed on the top screen of the Nintendo 3DS system, while the bottom screen displays maps of environments, party stats and other information such as item menus. On the world map, a day-night cycle alters the types of enemies present, and after <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the story an airship {{can be used to}} speed up travel and access previously inaccessible areas. In towns, players can interact with non-playable characters (NPCs), purchase items or magic at specialized shops, buy or sell weapons and equipment at an armory, or rest at an inn to restore health points (HP) and magic points (MP). In all environments, the party can find chests containing items, weapons or equipment. During certain points, a Party Chat option appears, giving players the option of initiating conversations between the party members. During exploration, standard enemies appear through random encounters: outside battle, the counter rate can be adjusted from high to nothing. The game features multiple difficulty levels, which can be adjusted freely outside battle.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Vesperia is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{set in a}} fantasy world featuring three-dimensional environments and characters. The game's environments are split into two types. On the field map, the main characters navigate reduced-scale environments. A compass and mini-map are displayed, along with towns, other named locations, and enemy icons. Striking an enemy icon triggers a battle, while interacting with a town causes the party to enter it. In battle and towns or similar locations, characters move around environments built on a lifelike scale relative to the human characters. In these areas, the party may interact with non-player characters (NPCs). Within these environments, items such as crates came be moved by the currently-assigned character. After <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the game, an item called the Sorcerer's Ring {{is given to the}} party, enabling them to shoot bolts of energy. These bolts can be used to activate switches, move objects, and attack enemies from a distance. Save points can be found in dungeons and towns. Items such as equipment and weapons are purchased with Gald, the in-game currency. While in environments, players can trigger optional character conversations called Skits. In Skits, characters are represented by head-and-shoulder portraits, and the conversations can range from dramatic to comedic.|$|E

25|$|Subversion {{uses the}} inter-file {{branching}} model from Perforce to implement branches and tagging. A branch {{is a separate}} line of development. Tagging refers to labeling the repository at <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> time {{so that it can}} be easily found in the future. In Subversion, the only difference between branches and tags is how they are used.|$|E
25|$|In {{time-based}} prospective memory tasks, {{participants are}} asked to remember to perform a task at <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> time. There are also numerous possible types of time-based tasks. For example, Cheng et al. (2008) asked participants to check a clock every five minutes during a written test, while Adda et al. (2008) asked participants to remind the experimenter to pay a bill on time.|$|E

25|$|The {{second season}} of the Israeli version {{introduced}} a different format for the Yield and U-Turn. Unlike the original format, each team would have to vote sometime during the leg for the team they wish to Yield and {{the team with the}} most votes is forced to wait out the Yield at <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> later <b>in</b> the Leg. Because of this, the limit of the number of times a team can Yield was removed.|$|R

At <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the series, she becomes heavily traumatized by violent hallucinations; while Lain begins freely delving into the Wired, Mika is taken there by her proximity to Lain, and she gets stuck between the real world and the Wired.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the very}} similar {{processes}} of place name formation in Sinhala and Tamil explicated above, {{it is not}} always easy to establish the original language of a place name, because loan translations are common in both directions. For such an alleged example of loan translation, see the case of Trincomalee above. Additionally, some place names draw on Sanskrit or Pali roots, which are then adapted to Sinhala and Tamil phonology in different ways. These intricacies {{must be taken into account}} when evaluating claims that a certain area was predominantly inhabited by one group or the other at <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> time.|$|E

25|$|Ontotheology {{means the}} {{ontology}} of God and/or {{the theology of}} being. While the term was first used by Immanuel Kant, it has only come into broader philosophical parlance with the significance it took for Martin Heidegger's later thought. While, for Heidegger, the term is used to critique the whole tradition of 'Western metaphysics', much recent scholarship has sought to question whether 'ontotheology' developed at <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the metaphysical tradition, with many seeking to equate the development of 'ontotheological' thinking {{with the development of}} modernity, and Duns Scotus often being cited as the first 'ontotheologian'.|$|E
25|$|In the Prospective Remembering Video Procedure (PRVP), {{participants}} are informed {{that they will}} receive tasks to complete while watching a video on a television screen. They are given a response sheet in order to record details of the tasks when the appropriate cues appear in the video. A distractor task is given at <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> order to test for prospective memory. Titov and Knight (2001) used a PRVP with a video consisting of a pedestrian walking through a shopping district and required participants to make decisions on whether to buy certain items {{as if they were}} the pedestrian. Shopping requires many prospective memory intentions such as remembering what items are needed and what items can be purchased another day.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} hoard had a {{group of}} 72 pieces with similar patination and soil crusting, suggesting common burial. There were 7 Mkporo; 19 Nkobnkob-round foot; 9 Nkobnkob-oval foot; and 37 Popo-square foot. The lightest 'Nkobnkobs' in the hoard were 108 gm and 114 gm, while they are routinely found (called Onoudu) under 80 gm, this implies that the group was buried at <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the size devolution of the manilla. Mkporo are made of brass. The weight correspondence of the oval-foot Nkobnkob with {{the high end of}} the round-foot range suggests that it is either the earlier variety, or contemporary with the earliest round-foots. The exclusive presence of the 'square-foot' variety of French Popo, normally scarce among circulation groups of Popos, suggests that this is the earliest variety. The earliest French manillas as likely to be contemporaries of the earliest British pieces.|$|E
