5|$|The film Casablanca was a {{plot device}} in the science-fiction {{television}} movie Overdrawn at the Memory Bank (1983), based on John Varley's story. It {{was referred to}} in Terry Gilliam's dystopian Brazil (1985). Warner Bros. produced its own parody in the homage Carrotblanca, a 1995 Bugs Bunny cartoon. In Casablanca, a novella by Argentine writer Edgar Brau, the protagonist somehow wanders into Rick's Café Américain <b>and</b> <b>listens</b> to a strange tale related by Sam.

40|$|The present paper {{studies the}} English imperatives look <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> used as {{discourse}} markers. The study focuses on two aspects: firstly, {{to identify the}} factors indicating the primary function {{as opposed to the}} discourse function of look <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> in English, <b>and</b> secondly, to analyse the Czech counterparts of these verbs used as discourse markers. The paper is comprised of two main parts. The first, theoretical background, describes the grammatical form of the English imperative with focus on look <b>and</b> <b>listen,</b> the concept of discourse markers, the cross-linguistic studies focusing specifically on look <b>and</b> <b>listen,</b> the correspondence between English and Czech imperative, and the potential Czech counterparts.

Darryl demands anew to be fired, then switches gears: he tells Andy {{to give him the}} manager job, saying he deserves it and wants that or a pink slip. Andy then steps up and bluntly tells Darryl he not only {{is not going to do}} that, but Darryl was not even the runner-up to Andy in the selection process. As he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glenn, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk <b>and</b> <b>listens</b> to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board, and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and one or two of Andy's applicants.|$|E

5|$|Because Hope was a {{work that}} was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that Hope was a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself <b>and</b> <b>listens</b> only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} test-taking motivation in L 2 listening testing context by applying Expectancy-Value Theory as the framework. Specifically, {{this study was}} intended to examine the complex relationships among expectancy, importance, interest, listening anxiety, <b>listening</b> metacognitive awareness, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> test score using data from a large-scale and high-stakes language test among Chinese first-year undergraduates. Structural equation modeling {{was used to examine}} the mediating effect of listening metacognitive awareness on the relationship between expectancy, importance, interest, <b>listening</b> anxiety, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> test score. According to the results, test takers’ listening scores can be predicted by expectancy, interest, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> anxiety significantly. The relationship between expectancy, interest, <b>listening</b> anxiety, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> test score was mediated by listening metacognitive awareness. The findings have implications for test takers to improve their test taking motivation <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> metacognitive awareness, as well as for L 2 teachers to intervene in L 2 listening classrooms...|$|R
5|$|Sutherland {{travels to}} Como {{to rest and}} recover from illness, indulging in free {{religious}} speculation while there. He befriends Helen Leonard, who sympathises with his troubles <b>and</b> <b>listens</b> to his doubts. Helen's dull, unloving husband prefers to spend time away from his wife, and leaves her in Sutherland's company for the season. Helen and Sutherland fall in love, causing both great anxiety, although the relationship never becomes physical. The two consider eloping, but Helen decides she cannot leave her daughter, Annie. During this conversation, however, the unsupervised Annie dips her arm into the lake, causing her to fall ill and die soon after. Sutherland again becomes depressed, believing that his religious speculations have brought himself and Helen into sin. He plans suicide, but is stopped {{at the last moment}} by an old friend, representative of John Henry Newman. Sutherland retires to a monastery, although his repentance is short lived, and he dies still in doubt. Helen, meanwhile, separates from her husband and retires to a convent, although she is unreconciled with the Church because she maintains that her love for Sutherland is holier than her marriage.|$|E

In this research, the correlational method was used and it was carried out in October to November 2014 at SMA Muhammadiyah 1 Surakarta. The population was science class of the eleventh grade students of SMA Muhammadiyah 1 Surakartain Academic Year 2014 / 2015, which consisted of three classes. The number of population was 73 students and this research took 30 students as the sample by cluster random sampling. A questionnaire was used to collect the data of students’learning motivation, whilean objective test was used to collect the data of vocabulary mastery <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension. Single <b>and</b> Multiple Linear Regression and Correlation were used to analyze the data. The result of the analysis shows that (1) there is a positive correlation between students’ learning motivation <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension (to= 2. 5); (2) there is a positive correlation between vocabulary mastery <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension(to= 2. 14); and (3) there is a positive correlation between students’ learning motivation, vocabulary mastery simultaneously, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension(Fo= 3. 54).
