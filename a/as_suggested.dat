5|$|At {{least one}} sibling of Nyuserre is known with near-certainty: Neferefre, {{who was a}} son of Neferirkare and Khentkaus II, was Nyuserre's elder brother. Since the {{relation}} between Shepseskare and Nyuserre remains uncertain, {{it is possible that}} the two were brothers too, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by Roth, although the dominant hypothesis is that Shepseskare was a son of Sahure and hence Nyuserre's uncle.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare {{may have}} left {{some of his}} monuments {{unfinished}} at his death, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by several relief-bearing blocks inscribed with his name and which were found reused in the pyramid of king Unas. Their original setting remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|During winter, {{it often}} makes short {{distance}} movements, and some birds move into parts of western Pakistan and an adjoining corner of Iran, and less commonly north-western Gujarat, India. Longer movements may occur, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by a possible sighting in the United Arab Emirates in November 2000.|$|E

5|$|High {{potassium}} levels {{tend to be}} {{a feature}} of severe rhabdomyolysis. Electrocardiography (ECG) may show whether the elevated potassium levels are affecting the conduction system of the heart, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by the presence of T wave changes or broadening of the QRS complex. Low calcium levels may be present in the initial stage due to binding of free calcium to damaged muscle cells.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Gareloi Volcano {{underwent}} a major explosive eruption where it generated four lava flows, andesitic tuff, volcanic glass, and scoria of red tone. Thirteen craters, all {{located in the}} fissure, contributed to this episode. All are most likely phreatic. During the eruption, pyroclastic flows convened with tephra, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by deposits. Lahar also streamed from the summit.|$|E
5|$|It has {{recently}} been determined that the echolocation vocalizations {{do not agree with}} evolutionary relationship between swiftlet species <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by DNA sequence comparison. This suggests that as in bats, echolocation sounds, once present, adapt rapidly and independently to the particular species' acoustic environment.|$|E

A letter published in an auto magazine later that year describes a certain new car as containing [...] "all nine yards of goodies". In 1964, several newspapers published a syndicated story which explained that [...] "Give 'em the whole nine yards" [...] was NASA talk for an item-by-item report. This early usage can be read <b>as</b> <b>suggesting</b> length, but can also be read <b>as</b> <b>suggesting</b> detailed completeness.|$|R

5|$|Manuel's career under Leo's successor, Michael II the Amorian (r. 820–829), is unclear, {{as he is}} not {{mentioned}} in the sources during this period. Certainly {{at the time of the}} outbreak of the great rebellion of Thomas the Slav, the strategos of the Armeniacs was Olbianos, while the Anatolics joined the rebellion. Manuel himself, however, evidently remained loyal to Michael, and it was probably the latter who raised him to the rank of magistros. The editors of the Prosopographie der mittelbyzantinischen Zeit suggest that Manuel may have been recalled by Michael to Constantinople, especially if the marriage of Michael's son and heir Theophilos (r. 829–842) and Manuel's niece Theodora took place around 821, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by E.W. Brooks, and not around 830, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by Treadgold.|$|E
5|$|San Martín did {{not mention}} Escalada in his first battle report, leading initial historians to infer that they stayed within the convent during the battle. However it is {{currently}} considered that they {{took part in the}} battle, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by the royalist battle report and a later report from San Martin which clarifies that only twelve grenadiers stayed in the convent.|$|E
5|$|At {{an early}} stage, in {{documents}} {{written in the}} paleo-Hebrew script, words were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran. Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is not direct evidence for biblical texts being written without word division, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by Nahmanides {{in his introduction to}} the Torah. Word division using spaces was commonly used {{from the beginning of the}} 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script. In addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses cantillation marks, which serve to mark word stress, semantic structure, and the musical motifs used in formal recitation of the text.|$|E

5|$|At any size, a meat ant nest {{always has}} a {{possibility}} of dying out in any year, but the site may be reoccupied by another colony. Hence, nests can be very old <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> in one study. Some nests may never be reoccupied for unknown reasons. The regrowth of vegetation which shades the nest, soil damage or even a disease may wipe out a colony and leave the nest site completely abandoned. The death of a colony may be obvious when competing colonies increase in population and size by expanding their territories with well-established satellite nests in order exploit the food sources once used by a former colony. Satellite nests may diverge from their parent nests to become independent, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by the antagonism of worker ants from different nests or when others are uninhabitable by insecticide treatment. After the eradication of a nest, satellite nests emerge nearby, and may sever their connections with the parent nest. The separation of a satellite nest is an effective way for a nest to exploit food sources, and a colony with less than 11 entrance holes is recognised as non-mature (a nest is mature at 12). As most satellite nests have 11 holes and accept a queen of their own, a satellite nest may easily develop maturity in one year.|$|E
5|$|During {{the march}} to Kediri, the Mataram–VOC army purposefully split {{itself and the}} columns took different, {{indirect}} routes to Kediri, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by Amangkurat. This enabled the army to meet more factions and to win over those with wavering allegiance. The army marched through areas previously unexplored by the Dutch. The Dutch account was recorded in a journal by Hurdt's secretary Johan Jurgen Briel. Accounts of the campaign also appear in babads (Javanese chronicles).|$|E
5|$|Feedback editors John Hoyland and Mike Holderness {{subsequently}} {{adopted the}} term nominative determinism <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by reader C. R. Cavonius. The term {{first appeared in}} the 17 December issue. Even though the magazine tried to ban the topic numerous times over the decades since, readers kept sending in curious examples. These included the U.S. Navy spokesman put up to answer journalists' questions about the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, one Lieutenant Mike Kafka; authors of the book The Imperial Animal Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox; and the UK Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on knife crime, Alfred Hitchcock.|$|E

5|$|However, Paramount {{rejected}} the track, believing that Leonard {{was incapable of}} creating the score for the film. Leonard later presented the instrumental to Madonna, who decided {{to use it for}} At Close Range, the new film starring her then-husband, actor Sean Penn. Madonna wrote all the lyrics, added some melodies to the composition, and recorded a demo on a cassette. She presented the track to the film's director James Foley, who liked it and enlisted Leonard to compose the film's score, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by Madonna.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 a {{political}} crisis emerged in Poland {{with the emergence}} of the Solidarity mass movement. By the end of October, Solidarity had 3 million members, and by December, had 9 million. In a public opinion poll organised by the Polish government, 89% of the respondents supported Solidarity. With the Polish leadership split on what to do, the majority did not want to impose martial law, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by Wojciech Jaruzelski. The Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc was unsure how to handle the situation, but Erich Honecker of East Germany pressed for military action. In a formal letter to Brezhnev, Honecker proposed a joint military measure to control the escalating problems in Poland. A CIA report suggested the Soviet military were mobilising for an invasion.|$|E
5|$|In the late-13th century, many of {{the newly}} {{emerging}} painter's guilds were nominating Luke as their patron saint. The van der Weyden panel is among the first known depictions of St Luke painting the Virgin in Northern Renaissance art, along with a similar work, a lost triptych panel by Robert Campin. Van der Weyden presents a humanised Virgin and Child, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by the realistic contemporary surroundings, the lack of halos, and the intimate spatial construction. Yet he infuses the panel with extensive religious iconography.|$|E

5|$|The {{allotetraploid}} hybrid species {{derived from}} A.montanum can backcross with A.montanum to form triploid hybrids. The backcross hybrid between A.montanum and A.pinnatifidum is A.×trudellii, <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by Wherry. He also collected specimens of the backcross hybrid between A.montanum and A.bradleyi from a cliff near Blairstown, New Jersey in 1935. The hybrid received no further attention until 1961, {{when it was}} described and named in Wherry's honor as Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi). The sterile diploid A.montanum × platyneuron, precursor to A.bradleyi, was collected in 1972 at Crowder's Mountain, Georgia; A.montanum × rhizophyllum, precursor to A.pinnatifidum, has never been found.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} on the convergence of prices in the eurozone {{with the introduction of}} the euro is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s. Other studies have found evidence of price convergence, in particular for cars. A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by a recent study (2009).|$|E
5|$|After 1732, the King's Mews {{were divided}} into the Great Mews and the smaller Green Mews to the north by the Crown Stables, a large block, built to the designs of William Kent. Its site is {{occupied}} by the National Gallery. In 1826 the Commissioners of H.M. Woods, Forests and Land Revenues instructed John Nash to draw up plans for clearing a large area south of Kent's stable block, and as far east as St Martin's Lane. His plans left open the whole area of what became Trafalgar Square, except for a block in the centre, which he reserved for a new building for the Royal Academy. The plans included the demolition and redevelopment of buildings between St Martin's Lane and the Strand {{and the construction of}} a road (now called Duncannon Street) across the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields. The Charing Cross Act was passed in 1826 and clearance started soon after. Nash died soon after construction started, impeding its progress. The square was to be named for William IV commemorating his ascent to the throne in 1830. Around 1835, it was decided that the square would be named after the Battle of Trafalgar <b>as</b> <b>suggested</b> by architect George Ledwell Taylor, commemorating Nelson's victory over the French and Spanish in 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
