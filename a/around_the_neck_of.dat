5|$|One more rivalry {{from the}} Raw brand was between John Cena and JBL. In the Fatal Four-Way Elimination match at Backlash, Cena {{eliminated}} JBL by making him {{submit to the}} STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps his arm <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back {{on the head of}} the opponent. On the April 28 episode of Raw, JBL challenged Cena to a singles match at Judgment Day, which was made official on WWE's website.|$|E
5|$|The {{jewellery}} {{consists of}} three gold pendants, two glass beads, one gold wire bead, and a fragment of a jet hair pin. The pendants and beads all {{seem to have been}} strung together, probably forming a necklace that was in place <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the body. Two of the pieces consist of gold cabochon pendants inset with jewels, while the third is a very elaborate shield-shaped jewel inlaid with 57 red garnets and a larger scallop-shaped gem in the centre. The garnets rest on a thin layer of gold leaf to reflect the light and increase their luminosity. It may have been created from recycled older pieces of jewellery, as the size, shape and thickness of the individuals garnet are all different.|$|E
5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E

5|$|The {{meeting at}} Aintree had been beset by {{problems}} before the race. Fifteen animal rights protesters invaded the course near the first fence (as had also {{happened at the}} 1991 Grand National) resulting in a delayed start. A first false start was caused by several riders becoming tangled in the starting tape. Starter Keith Brown, who was officiating his last National before retirement, waved his red recall flag and a second official, Ken Evans, who was situated 100 yards further down the track, in turn signalled to the leading runners to turn around. At the second attempt, the tape became tangled again — <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> jockey Richard Dunwoody — and Brown called another false start. However, this time his recall flag did not unfurl as he waved it. As a result, 30 of the 39 riders set off around the track, oblivious to the recall.|$|E
5|$|To {{create the}} {{original}} label for THB, Star Breweries opted to copy an existing label for a Dutch beer brand called The Holland Beer, which featured {{the image of}} three horses. This was done {{in part because of}} the association between Antsirabe and its history of horse breeding; the brand took the name Three Horses Beer based on this design. The label also features the brand's slogan, Soa Ny Fiarahantsika ("The Pleasure of Being Together"). The labels were originally printed in the Netherlands and shipped to Madagascar before eventually being produced on the local market; THB coasters continue to be produced in Europe. The bottle color and shape and its label have undergone adjustments over time. In 2005, the label was enlarged and the colors brightened. The band <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the bottle was also broadened with the addition of the image of a medal, in honor of the beer's first international award in 2004. A new logo was adopted for the canned THB before being expanded in 2014 to the 33 cl bottled THB. The new logo features three stylized, outlined white horses, now facing right to represent a focus on the future. Red remains the predominant color.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Backlash was a triple threat match, a match {{involving}} three wrestlers, for the WWE Championship between John Cena, Triple H, and Edge. The buildup to the match began when Triple H lost the Royal Rumble match, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner but {{participated in the}} 2006 Road to WrestleMania Tournament, where the winner would become the number-one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania. Triple H won the tournament. Cena defeated Triple H at WrestleMania to retain the title after forcing him {{to submit to the}} STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps his arm <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent. The next night on Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, Triple H demanded another shot at the WWE Championship, but Edge and Lita (Edge's girlfriend) interrupted Triple H's segment. Edge said that he became WWE Champion at New Year's Revolution when he cashed in his Money in the Bank title shot, that he won at WrestleMania 21, and defeating Cena at the event, after Cena had defeated five other men in an Elimination Chamber, a match featuring wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by a steel structure of chain and girders. Cena, however, reclaimed the Championship at the 2006 Royal Rumble, when he defeated Edge. Edge claimed {{that it was time for}} a new opponent for the WWE Championship, after stating that at WrestleMania, Triple H lost his opportunity when he lost to Cena. All three men had a series of Handicap matches, a match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as three against two, or two against one leading up to Backlash with Triple H pinning Cena after tucking Cena's head between his knees and jumping up to slam his head to the mat, a move that Triple H calls the Pedigree, Cena forcing Edge to submit to the STFU, and Edge executing a shoulder block takedown on Triple H and pinning him. It was then announced that Cena would defend the WWE Championship in a Triple Threat match against Triple H and Edge at Backlash.|$|E

An image is produced by controlling the intensity {{of each of the}} three electron beams, one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a video signal as a reference. In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by magnetic deflection, a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the tube, although electrostatic deflection is commonly used in oscilloscopes, a type of electronic test instrument.|$|E

25|$|The thali is {{an emblem}} {{shaped like a}} leaf and which is worn as a necklace.

The thalikettu kalyanam was the ritual during which the thali would be tied on a piece of string <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> a Nair girl. If the girl should reach puberty before the ceremony took place then she would in theory have been out-caste, although it is probable that this stricture was not in fact observed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of a shift in low positions, the thumb of the left hand moves up or down the neck of the {{instrument}} so as to remain in the same position relative to the fingers (though the movement of the thumb may occur slightly before, or slightly after, the movement of the fingers). In such positions, the thumb is often thought of as an 'anchor' whose location defines what position the player is in. In very high positions, the thumb is unable to move with the fingers as the body of the instrument gets in the way. Instead, the thumb works <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the instrument to sit at {{the point at which the}} neck meets the right bout of the body, and remains there while the fingers move between the high positions.|$|E
25|$|The {{confrontation}} between Konnan and Pierroth Jr. {{was just a}} preview for their match later that night, in the semi-final position of the show. The two faced off in a Dog collar match, which meant that the two were joined together by a long steel chain that was connected to a dog collar <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> each competitor. The collar was then locked to prevent one of the wrestlers from {{getting out of the}} collar during the match. At some point Pierroth Jr. either stole the key from the referee, or had a spare key hidden somewhere as he was able to take off his collar, use the freedom of movement to tie up Konnan and hit him repeatedly with the steel chain. With Konnan down Pierroth Jr. was able to touch the top turnbuckle on all four corners, which was how the match was won.|$|E

25|$|On February 16, 2014, University of Mississippi campus police {{discovered}} the James Meredith memorial statue, erected in October 2006, surrounded with pre-2003 Georgia State Flags (containing the Confederate Flag) and a rope tied into a noose <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the statue. Meredith, an alumnus of the University of Mississippi, was, in October 1962, the first African American {{to attend the}} school. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Oxford, Mississippi Police Department conducted an investigation shortly after the event {{which led to the}} arrest of Graeme Phillip Harris, a former freshman at the university. Harris pleaded guilty in June 2015 to a misdemeanor for using threat of force to intimidate African-American students and employees. U.S. District Judge Michael P. Mills sentenced Harris to six months in prison, followed by twelve months of supervision after release. A second student, Austin Reed Edenfield, 21, was sentenced to a year of probation in addition to 50 hours of community service. A third student has yet to be charged.|$|E
25|$|People {{believed}} {{that women who}} were not faithful to their husbands would experience prolonged labor, and male traditional healers would remark that a promiscuous woman {{would have to tell}} every person in the room the number of men she has slept with apart from her husband before {{she would be able to}} give birth. Other traditional beliefs and practices related to laboring women included special herbs being used when the umbilical cord was wrapped <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the fetus and for breech presentations, hot water poured on the abdomen and okra smeared on the vagina to expedite delivery, women who could not birth the placenta were given a bottle to blow into in order to force the placenta out, and a calabash of hot water was placed on the abdomen to stop postpartum hemorrhage and bleeding. Although many people have extensive knowledge of these traditional beliefs and practices, many indicate that most people no longer use them.|$|E
25|$|After this, {{a series}} of engagements took place over a six-week period to reduce the main Japanese {{position}} around Mount Sugi, commencing with the 19th Infantry Battalion's assault across the Wulwut River on 5 March. The position around Mount Sugi, which stretched across a number of ridges {{to the west of}} the Wulwut, was heavily defended with mortars, machine guns and pillboxes, and heavy rain also frustrated Australian attempts to reduce the Japanese stronghold. Heavy fighting followed, culminating with the 14th/32nd's attack on Bacon Hill on 18 March. Following the capture of Waitavalo–Tol area in March–April, the Australians exploited towards Jammer Bay and sent patrols to link up their northern and southern drives. They also brought in reinforcements, first from the 13th Infantry Brigade and then the 4th, as the offensive part of their campaign effectively came to an end. A series of command changes occurred around this time, also. In April, Major General Horace Robertson took over command from Ramsay, while Major General Kenneth Eather assumed control in early August. In the months that followed, the Australians mounted {{a series of}} patrols aimed at maintaining the line <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the Gazelle Peninsula to prevent any attempt by the Japanese to break out from Rabaul. This lasted until the end of the war in August 1945.|$|E
