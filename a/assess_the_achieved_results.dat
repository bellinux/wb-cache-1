40|$|Dust {{outbreaks}} are meteorological {{phenomena of}} great interest for scientists and authorities (because of {{their impact on the}} climate, environment, and human activities), which may be detected, monitored, and characterized from space using different methods and procedures. Among the recent dust detection algorithms, the RSTDUST multi-temporal technique has provided good results in different geographic areas (e. g., Mediterranean basin; Arabian Peninsula), exhibiting a better performance than traditional split window methods, in spite of some limitations. In this study, we present an optimized configuration of this technique, which better exploits data provided by Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) aboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites to address those issues (e. g., sensitivity reduction over arid and semi-arid regions; dependence on some meteorological clouds). Three massive dust events affecting Europe and the Mediterranean basin in May 2008 / 2010 are analysed in this work, using information provided by some independent and well-established aerosol products to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>results.</b> The study shows that the proposed algorithm, christened eRSTDUST (i. e., enhanced RSTDUST), which provides qualitative information about dust outbreaks, is capable of increasing the trade-off between reliability and sensitivity.

40|$|This paper aims to {{understand}} how business networks created by Small and Medi-um Enterprises (SMEs) measure <b>the</b> common <b>results</b> <b>achieved</b> through <b>the</b> example of Italian network contracts. The relevance of the topic is demonstrated by the widespread adoption of networking strategies and the difficulty for both research-ers and SMEs managers to evaluate {{the success of the}} alliances created.

Preference has been given to the use of multiple case-studies. Data collection recurred to direct inter-views and document analysis. Our findings indicate that the analyzed SMEs networks do not have a proper man-agement control system at the network level.

Methods: 35 patients with serious injuries of the distal third of upper limbs were studied. We <b>assessed</b> <b>the</b> kind of trauma, injury site, flap size, skin coverage need, clinical outcome and complications. Results: The most frequent mechanism of trauma was motorcycle accident. The most commonly affected regions were: dorsal hand, wrist volar regions and the first commissure. In all patients, the flap size was enough to cover key tissues exposed by the injury. The donor area did not show complications, being primarily closed in 23 cases. The outcomes were good for 31 cases. In 22 patients, no complication was found, and the flap was completely lost in four. Conclusion: Posterior interbone artery flap provides good outcomes in covering serious injuries of the distal third of upper limbs, leading to a stable and reliable coverage, not compromising key irrigating arteries of the hand, enabling the performance of reconstruction procedures.

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} main {{results of an}} {{experimental}} gathering campaign carried out on a moving bed membrane bioreactor pilot plant conceived for carbon and nutrients removal according to a University of Cape Town scheme. Organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus removal, biokinetic/stoichiometric constants, membrane fouling tendency and sludge dewaterability have been <b>assessed</b> during experiments. <b>The</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>results</b> showed that pilot plant was able to guarantee very high carbon removal, with average efficiency of 98 %. In terms of nitrification, the system showed an excellent performance, with efficiencies higher than 98 % {{for most of the}} experiments. This result might be related to the presence of biofilm in the aerobic compartment that contributed to sustain the complete nitrification of the influent ammonium. Conversely, the average P removal efficiency was quite moderate, likely due to the increase of the ammonium loading rate that could promote an increased NO 3 -N recycled from the anoxic to the anaerobic tank, interfering with PAOs activity inside the anaerobic tank. Referring to membrane fouling, the irreversible resistance due to superficial cake deposition was the mechanism that mostly affected the membrane filtration properties. Moreover, it was noticed the increase of the resistance due to pore blocking and a general worsening of the membrane filtration properties. This result could be due to the increase of the EPSBound fraction that could be promoted by biofilm detachment phenomena occurred during experiments...|$|R
40|$|EU {{strategies}} for waste management have long recognized the key role of recycling {{to move towards}} sustainable consumption and production. This resulted {{in a range of}} regulatory measures, among which the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive, which sets weight-based targets for recovery, preparation for re-use and recycling. The increasing strategic relevance of the supply of raw materials has, however, spurred a more integrated approach towards resource efficiency. In addition to the prevention of disposal, recycling practices are now also meant to contribute to sustainable materials management by pursuing (i) a higher degree of material cycle closure, (ii) an improved recovery of strategically relevant materials, and (iii) the avoidance of environmental burdens associated with the extraction and refining of primary raw materials. In response to this evolution, this paper reports about the development of an indicator set that allows to quantitatively demonstrate these recycling benefits, hence going further than the weight-based objectives employed in the WEEE directive. The indicators can be calculated for WEEE recycling processes for which information is available on both input and output fractions. It offers a comprehensive framework that aims to support decision making processes on product design, to identify opportunities for the optimization of WEEE End-of-Life scenarios, and to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> <b>achieved</b> (or expected) <b>results</b> of implemented (or planned) recycling optimization strategies.

This seems to be a good time for <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>achieved</b> to date by the community policy in this area and analysing whether the correct approach has been adopted. Despite the satisfaction shown in certain official appraisals, the picture resulting from consulting different classifications globally measuring the adaptation of countries to the information society is not that optimistic. Only the European Union leaders in this field (the Nordic countries) have improved their positions, broadening the gap with the rest: western European countries have lost ground (or at least have not improved) in the rankings, the southern countries do not seem to have corrected their deficiencies and the indices for the new Member States have not evolved as expected or have even deteriorated in some cases. Even though becoming one of the most competitive and dynamic "knowledge-based" economies in the world was the first "Leitmotiv" of the Lisbon strategy, the interpretation of the documents connected to the definition of the new stage in the strategy led to doubts over whether the European Union has a clear notion on the course of action to take in order to make progress on the information society a matter of priority.

40|$|The {{design and}} CMOS {{implementation}} of Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) architectures for real-time multimedia signal processing {{is discussed in}} the paper. Two multi-tile architectures are proposed and compared with reference to audio and video processing target applications. One architecture exploits an homogeneous topology; it consists of 8 identical tiles, each made of a 32 -bit RISC core enhanced by a 64 -bit DSP co-processor with local memory resources. The other multi-core architecture exploits an heterogeneous-tile topology with on-chip distributed memory resources; the tiles act as application specific processors (ASIPs) supporting different class of algorithms. Since the ASIP tiles can work concurrently, then a large set of processing algorithms is supported. In both architectures the multiple tiles are interconnected by a Network-on-Chip (NoC) infrastructure with Spidergon topology through Network Interfaces (NIs) and Routers. The packet-switched data transfer scheme of NoC allows parallel operations of the multiple tiles. The functional performances and the implementation complexity (area, power) of the NoC-based MPSoC architectures are <b>assessed</b> by presenting <b>the</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>results</b> when <b>the</b> platforms are synthesized in submicron CMOS technology. Among the large set of supported algorithms, two example case studies are considered: the real-time implementation of a H. 264 /MPEG AVC video codec and of a low-distortion digital audio amplifier. The heterogeneous architecture ensures a higher power efficiency and a smaller area occupation. The homogeneous scheme allows for a higher flexibility and easier system scalability since the tiles are the same and offer more general purpose computation resources. The heterogeneous MPSoC is more suited for low-power multimedia processing, such as in mobile devices; the homogeneous MPSoC is more suited for general purpose DSP tasks in power-supplied devices...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{methods for}} reactor network {{synthesis}} vary from graphical approaches such as Attainable Region to superstructure-based optimisation using both deterministic and stochastic methods. Complex reactor network applications, consisting of many components and highly non-linear reaction kinetics, tend to face problems using current methods. Dimensionality limitations, initialisation problems, convergence difficulties and excessive computational times {{are some of}} the shortcomings, In an effort to overcome these difficulties, this project introduces the concept of Knowledge Driven Optimisation, utilising systems knowledge in order to develop rules that help to focus the optimisation search on high performance regions. The method uses knowledge derived from kinetic infoimation to gain an understanding of the system and devise a set of rules to guide the optimisation search. Data mining techniques are engaged to analyse serial and parallel pathways, relating concentration and temperature variables to regions of high performance. Extracted trends are translated into optimal design rules, and applied to a customised Tabu Search. Rule violations identify directions for improvement and aide move selection, guiding the superstructure optimisation search towards well performing structures, achieving more effective knowledge-based decision making than can be realised by a random stochastic search alone. Results show optimal solutions obtained for a number of examples agree with published literature whilst achieving faster convergence and reduced computational times compared to standard Tabu Search. To increase rule performance automatically, dynamic rule updates are implemented to tune the rule limits as the optimal search progresses. A hybrid optimisation approach, combining the stochastic rule-based search with deterministic techniques, is developed to promote efficient fine-tuning of the final structure. Application of the methodology to complex systems is demonstrated through a biocatalytic case study, metabolism by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the knowledge-driven rule-based approach significantly outperforms random Tabu Search. Preliminary studies into nonisothermal applications trial the use of temperature profiles. Finally, parallel processing and Grid technology is briefly investigated to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> potential for <b>achieving</b> <b>results</b> in reduced times...|$|R
40|$|To {{cope with}} the {{progressive}} tightening of the emission regulations, gasoline and diesel engines will continuously require highly improved exhaust after-treatment systems. In the case of diesel engines, the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) appears {{as one of the}} widely adopted technologies to reduce NOx (nitrogen oxides) emissions. Thereby, with the help of available heat from exhaust gas, the injected urea–water solution (UWS) turns inside the exhaust port immediately into gaseous ammonia (NH 3) by evaporation of mixture and thermal decomposition of urea. The reaction and conversion efficiency mostly depend upon the evaporation and subsequent mixing of the NH 3 into the exhaust gas, which in turn depends upon the engine loading conditions. Up to now, the aggregation of urea after evaporation of water and during the thermal decomposition of urea is not clearly understood. Hence, various scenarios for the urea depletion in the gaseous phase that can be envisaged have to be appraised under SCR operating conditions relying on an appropriate evaporation description. The objective of the present paper is therefore fourfold. First, a reliable multi-component evaporation model that includes a proper binary diffusion coefficient is developed {{for the first time in}} the Euler–Lagrangian CFD (computational fluid dynamics) framework to account properly for the distinct evaporation regimes of adBlue droplets under various operating conditions. Second, this model is extended for thermal decomposition of urea in the gaseous phase, where, depending on how the heat of thermal decomposition of urea is provided, different scenarios are considered. Third, since the evaporation model at and around the droplet surface is based on a gas film approach, how the material properties are evaluated in the film influences the process results is reported, also for the first time. Finally, the impact of various ambient temperatures on the adBlue droplet depletion characteristics as well as the effect of gravity is pointed out. The prediction capability of the model variants is <b>assessed</b> by comparing <b>the</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>results</b> to each other and with experimental data. It turns out that satisfactory agreement between experiment and numerical predictions is achieved for a wide range of operating temperatures by using correlations by “Wilke and Lee” for urea and by “Fuller et al. ” for water. The results are essentially sensitive to gravity. From subsequent comparisons of different ways to account for the thermal decomposition in the gaseous urea, a significant difference is observed. Finally, the 1 / 3 film rule widely used for evaluating the material properties in the film shows accurate prediction of both evaporation and thermal decomposition regimes of urea...|$|R
