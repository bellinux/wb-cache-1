2500|$|In {{response}} to criticism that they stereotype or generalize {{all members of}} a generation the authors have said, [...] "We've never tried to say that any individual generation {{is going to be}} monochromatic. It'll obviously include all kinds of people. But <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at generations as social units, we consider it to be at least as powerful and, in our view, far more powerful than other social groupings such as economic class, race, sex, religion and political parties." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1983 the Federal Government tasked a Mirage jet {{and later}} an RF-111, from the Royal Australian Air Force, {{to perform a}} {{reconnaissance}} mission over the dam {{as part of its}} case that the Tasmanian Government was not complying with Federal legislation to stop work. A photograph of the Franklin River taken on one of these missions (and showing the construction road) was signed after the case by all the judges involved and a copy is displayed in the Australian National University College of Law staff library. On 1 July 2008, twenty five years after the High Court decision that saved the Franklin River an anniversary dinner was held at Hobart's Grand Chancellor Hotel where former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke stated that the campaign to protect the Franklin River had important lessons for the struggle against global warming: [...] "And <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the arguments and the positions of political parties today you see a complete replication of what we experienced back there in 1983. The conservatives: they never change, they never learn. What was their argument back then? You can't do this, it will cost jobs. It will cost economic growth. You can't do it, you mustn't do it." ...|$|E

60|$|For Masie was beautiful. She was a deep-tinted blonde, {{with the}} calm poise {{of a lady}} who cooks butter cakes in a window.

6000|$|... "Oh I think it's a thing," [...] he said, [...] "that {{you must}} already have made out. I feel {{it so that}} I {{certainly}} must look it, speak it, and, as people say there, 'act' it. It sticks out of me, and you knew surely for yourself <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> at me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What say you, Wade!' he cried. 'Are {{we never}} {{to see a}} smile on that sad face of yours? Do you not see a {{woolsack}} in store for you <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> upon these brave fellows?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{take all}} the pubs {{this side of the}} ’igh Street an’ I’ll take the other," [...] said the cook. [...] "And if you look as cheerful <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> now you ought to take a lot o’ money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> {{upon the}} {{bathroom}} matter reasonably, I am quite sure we shan't quarrel. Tell me about Lady Letitia, please? Is she quite well--and the Marquis {{and all of}} them? And when are they coming down?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dog!" [...] shouted I--(I {{was sitting}} with my head to the donkey's tail, and so looked the Bobbachy full in the face)--"not so pale <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> when I felled you with this arm--not so pale as your women looked when I entered your harem!"

5000|$|Appearance, <b>as</b> in: <b>You</b> <b>look</b> like horseshit. In Kodak Moment Ned Gardner uses [...] "You like horseshit," [...] {{referring}} to one's appearance. One {{would not say}} <b>you</b> <b>look</b> like bullshit. This is the difference in colloquial use.|$|R

6000|$|... "Partly," [...] replied Miss Keeldar, smiling rather incredulously; [...] "but {{you are a}} {{peculiar}} personage. Quiet <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>look,</b> there is both a force and a depth somewhere within not easily reached or appreciated. Then you certainly are not happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Have you {{no words}} of triumph, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> on the ramparts that your people have fought {{for generations to}} behold at their mercy, as we now behold them? Can {{a woman of the}} Goths be silent when she stands before the city of Rome?' ...|$|E
60|$|Almah. No; you {{may find}} your cure an easier way, If you are pleased to seek it,--in your stay. All objects lose by too {{familiar}} view, When that great charm is gone, of being new; By often seeing me, you soon will find Defects so many, {{in my face and}} mind, That to be freed from love you need not doubt; And, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> it in, you'll look it out.|$|R

60|$|Simply {{that and}} nothing more. It is rugged in its simplicity. You wonder, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at it--if {{you have time}} to look at and wonder about these things--who this Jones may be; and what is the {{business}} he conducts with such coy reticence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{but that}} is a conundrum, pure and simple!" [...] the author protested. [...] "It is a poor parody on the old End-man pleasantry, 'Would you rather be as foolish <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>look,</b> or look as foolish as you are?' You are making it up!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wretch,' rejoined Nicholas, fiercely, 'touch him at your peril! I {{will not}} stand by, and see it done. My blood is up, and I have the {{strength}} of ten such men <b>as</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Look</b> to yourself, for by Heaven I will not spare you, if you drive me on!' ...|$|E
