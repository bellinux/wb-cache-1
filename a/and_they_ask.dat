They go to the {{hospital}} to gain answers, and it is revealed that Mercedes baby had died <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>ask</b> her to prepare for induced labour. Mercedes is devastated and later goes to find Joe for support but is left further heartbroken when his half-brother, Jason Roscoe (Alfie Browne-Sykes), tells her that he has left the village following their argument. She is left to face giving birth alone, but is relieved when her family arrive to support her.

Toyah later meets Peter Barlow, her new partner, and they agree to tell Leanne that they are together. Toby visits Toyah to save their {{marriage}} but she refuses to listen or reconcile.

500|$|Darryl {{thinks his}} {{popularity}} {{with the staff}} will make him a shoo-in, so he thinks {{he does not have}} to do an interview like everyone else. He is caught off-guard when he actually must do an interview <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>ask</b> for his resume. Darryl writes up an overly extensive four-page resume, which Jo quickly derides, though Jim encourages Darryl by saying that the interview and resume are mere formalities for him. When Andy interviews for the manager position, Gabe hijacks the meeting in an attempt to sabotage him by asking random trivia questions, which Andy successfully parries, but Gabe ends up screaming at him and acting like a lunatic. Gabe is also dismissive of Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) during her interview, saying she is not a [...] "real candidate". Kelly exacts revenge by telling Jo about Gabe's relationship with Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and his harassing behavior after their breakup. In response, Jo sends Gabe back to Sabre's Florida headquarters, and installs Kelly in Gabe's position on the search committee. Kelly then says she has accepted Dwight's bribery and looks forward to the benefits of his return to the manager's chair, as Toby haltingly says they could give Dwight another trial run and Jim looks on in horror. After Phyllis tells Jim that Kelly and Dwight have pre-fired her, Jim tells Dwight he is not and will not be the manager, and the office begins arguing about who will be selected. When the discussion gets out of control, with Ryan (B. J. Novak) preferring a homeless man, Andy declaring he wants the job, and Darryl's daughter Jada asking out loud if Jim is the guy making him manager, Jim cuts it short and brings the committee back to the conference room to make up their minds.|$|E

A few moments later a soldier arrives and announces that Ganon's evil forces have returned. Aginah and Zelda explain that Link has left the country <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>ask</b> the child to help obtain the eight [...] "Ancient Stone Tablets." [...] It is believed that if the hero/heroine can obtain these tablets, the message in them will reveal an ancient secret capable of defending Hyrule from Ganon and his army.|$|E
2500|$|Long ago, it {{must have}} been in the late 18th century, here in the church of Staničenje, all people who were there and all present priests were killed, so after that the church was closed in the next 30 years. And it was like this: one year, just for Annunciation, in the time, when the priests {{organized}} a Divine Liturgy, in the church and the churchyard were many people. Suddenly, Kardzhali start attack to the church and churchyard, when began the most horrible killing and slaughering of people and priests. All people and priests were killed that day. Everything was plundered and the church was almost destroyed in that Kardzhali action. And today, when someone starts digging wherever in the churchyard, it revealed the human bones of killed people in that day on the Annunciation. Since then the church in Staničenje could not longer serve to its purpose until the 1829. In that time, church did not have a priest because they were often killed. In [...] that year, 1829. people in Staničenje get one priest <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>ask</b> landowner to allow them to recover back the church so it can serve the purpose. Landowner accommodate them under the condition that they must give him, in a name of church holiday which is 26th July, a sterile sheep every year. People of Staničenje recovered the church and it began to serve again to its purpose, and the landowner, since that year, received sterile sheep from the village every year.|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile men in general, {{especially}} Englishmen, {{have a very}} sound instinct on {{this whole}} matter.

6000|$|Nothing is more amusing than {{to watch}} the efforts of our {{monopolist}} opponents to prove that other forms of property and increment {{are exactly the same}} and are similar in all respects to the unearned increment in land.

They talk to us of the profits of a railway through a greater degree of wealth and activity in the districts through which it runs.

6000|$|Of the Fifty-seven Questions {{we shall}} not give so much as one.

Neither in the Answers is there much notable. Mere quiet negations, for most part; an accused man standing on the simple basis of No: I do not recognise that document; I {{did not do that}} act; or did it according to the law that then was.

Well, they clubbed together, four of them, and gave me Tennyson in twelve volumes, illustrated with coloured photographs. They meant kindly, of course. If you suggest a tobacco-pouch they give you a blue velvet bag capable of holding about a pound, embroidered with flowers, life-size. The only way one could use it would be to put a strap to it and wear it as a satchel.
