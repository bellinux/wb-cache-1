50|$|<b>A</b> TLB refill <b>exception</b> is {{generated}} {{when there are}} no entries in the TLB that match the mapped virtual address. <b>A</b> TLB invalid <b>exception</b> {{is generated}} when there is a match but the entry is marked invalid. <b>A</b> TLB modified <b>exception</b> is generated when there is a match but the dirty status is not set.

As Hong Kong competes separately from mainland China, should an athlete from Hong Kong win the gold medal, and an athlete from mainland China win the silver and/or bronze medal(s) in the same event, the regional flag of Hong Kong would be raised in the centre above the national flag(s) during the medal presentation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{precipitation}} {{of sodium}} salts from aqueous solutions is rare because sodium salts typically {{have a high}} affinity for water; <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> is sodium bismuthate (NaBiO3). Because of this, sodium salts are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an organic solvent, such as ethanol; for example, only 0.35g/L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol. Crown ethers, like 15-crown-5, {{may be used as}} a phase-transfer catalyst.|$|E

A composite device only has a single device address because the host only assigns a device address to a function.|$|E
