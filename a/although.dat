5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study indicated that}} yoga may improve psychological health during cancer treatment, <b>although</b> more complete clinical evidence is needed to confirm this possible effect. Other preliminary research indicated that yoga could be a useful supplementary treatment to reduce the general psychopathology of schizophrenia, and may have positive effects on mental health, <b>although</b> the quality of research to define these effects is low.|$|E
5|$|A. tendagurensis {{was named}} in 1925 by Werner Janensch for a partial shin (MB.R.3620) {{found in the}} Kimmeridgian-age Tendaguru Formation in Mtwara, Tanzania. <b>Although</b> {{tabulated}} as a tentatively valid species of Allosaurus in the second edition of the Dinosauria, subsequent studies place it as indeterminate beyond Tetanurae, either a carcharodontosaurian or megalosaurid. <b>Although</b> obscure, {{it was a large}} theropod, possibly around 10meters long (33ft) and 2.5metric tons (2.8short tons) in weight.|$|E
5|$|African Americans were {{originally}} {{admitted to the}} university in the mid-1950s, but few attended until the 1970s; fraternities at this time were generally racially and religiously segregated. <b>Although</b> a student fraternity committee emphasized the fraternities' rejection of racial discrimination, in 1969 only 5 of 578 fraternity pledges were black. African-American fraternities and sororities soon established chapters at the university, <b>although</b> they presented themselves as service organizations rather than traditional social organizations. In the mid-1970s, <b>although</b> some black students were {{invited to join the}} heavily white fraternities, many preferred to join their own organizations. By the fall of 1973, four black fraternities and one black sorority had established chapters on grounds.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{had planned}} to settle Greek colonists on Bahrain, and <b>although</b> {{it is not clear}} that this {{happened}} on the scale he envisaged, Bahrain became very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the upper classes was Greek (<b>although</b> Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams. Bahrain even became the site of Greek athletic contests.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> Bosch's career flourished {{during the}} High Renaissance, {{he lived in}} an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been {{familiar}} with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, <b>although</b> it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> Duke Andrew {{made every}} effort to capture Queen Constance and King Ladislaus before they could escape, they were able to reach Vienna, Austria. Duke Leopold VI, who was King Emeric's and Duke Andrew's cousin, was willing to give shelter to King Ladislaus, <b>although</b> Duke Andrew {{threatened}} him with an invasion. Ladislaus abruptly died on 7 May 1205. His body was carried to Székesfehérvár, and buried in the Székesfehérvár Basilica.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> Himeji Castle was spared, Japanese castles {{had become}} {{obsolete}} and their preservation was costly.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> Hindu {{women have}} {{traditionally}} worn saris, the shalwar kameez and Western attire is gaining acceptance among younger women. Western dress is worn more by men, <b>although</b> the dhoti and kurta are seen during festivals. The formal male sherwani is often worn with chooridar on festive occasions. Diwali, holi and Vijayadasami {{are the three}} most popular festivals in Allahabad.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> Jersey {{does not}} have VAT, the States of Jersey {{introduced}} a goods and services tax (GST) on 6 May 2008, at a standard rate of 3%. The rate was amended to 5% on 1 June 2011. <b>Although</b> GST is at 5%, shopping in Jersey is still far more expensive than in the UK. Food is not exempt, unlike with VAT.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> Mambo and Estianty {{began work}} on another album, Mambo withdrew from the group in 2004 after {{widespread}} reports {{that she was pregnant}} and unmarried; Mambo said that she had been fired by Estianty, <b>although</b> she admitted that her pregnancy had been a factor. She was officially replaced on 7 April 2005 by Mulan Jameela, a café singer from Bandung who took the stage name Mulan Kwok.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> Mex and Violeta Urtizberea are {{father and}} daughter, Violeta {{accepted}} {{a role in}} the series without knowing that her father was also part of the cast and asked him to respect her space. <b>Although</b> they played characters of similar ages, they rarely have joint scenes. Julieta Ortega said that she has nothing in common with her character in the series. Juan Gil Navarro, who appeared in the television drama La Dueña at the same time, said that <b>although</b> he does not normally appear in comedies he followed his wife's suggestion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> Ravel {{wrote for}} mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and {{mezzo-soprano}} voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, {{and he seems}} to have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade, to be sung by a woman, <b>although</b> a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> Squidward, {{annoyed with}} SpongeBob's fear at the story, manages to {{convince}} him that he made the whole story up, the two are soon alarmed by strange occurrences that parallel the omens that signify the arrival of the Hash-Slinging Slasher later that night when the restaurant is empty. <b>Although</b> convinced at first that these occurrences are coincidence, Squidward grows more nervous as the occurrences continue.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> Swift {{knew that}} the Duchess of Kendal was {{responsible}} for selling the patent to Wood, he rarely mentions this fact in the Letters. Instead, his first three letters describe Wood as the mastermind behind the patent. <b>Although</b> the Drapier constantly asserts his loyalty to the King, his words did not prevent accusations of treason from being levelled against him {{in response to the}} third and fourth letters.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> {{assault by}} the heavily armed sloop HMS Dart proved successful, the fireships {{achieved}} little {{and various other}} British craft involved in the operation {{had little effect on}} the eventual outcome. The French response was disorganised and ineffectual, losing one frigate captured. Three others were almost destroyed, only escaping by cutting their anchor cables and fleeing into the coastal shoals where they ran aground. <b>Although</b> all three frigates were refloated and returned to service, the operation had cost the French heavy casualties. The British force suffered minimal losses, <b>although</b> the exact totals are uncertain. Many of the British officers involved were highly praised and rewarded with promotions and prize money.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> {{earmarked}} for operations against the Soviet Union, Luftflotte 2 {{remained in the}} west until May 1941. This was partly as a deception measure, and partly because new airbases in Poland could not be completed by 1 June 1941 target date, <b>although</b> they were made ready {{in time for the}} actual commencement of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941. Kesselring established his new headquarters at Bielany, a suburb of Warsaw.|$|E
