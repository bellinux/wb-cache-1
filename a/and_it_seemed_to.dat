5|$|A {{shakedown}} of {{the system}} {{took place during the}} first two weeks of November 1967 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> work. The PAVN siege of the U.S. Marines at the Khe Sanh Combat Base, in western Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, provided the opportunity for an operational test. The American command in Saigon launched Operation Niagara, the largest tactical and B-52 operation thus far in the conflict, to support the Marines at Khe Sanh. By the end of January 1968, Muscle Shoals had emplaced 316 sensors in 44 strings to detect PAVN troop movements in the vicinity of the combat base. The operation was deemed a success, but locating and targeting enemy troops moving toward a fixed location like Khe Sanh was not the same as doing it on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E
5|$|In 1953 Tange and the {{architectural}} journalist and critic Noboru Kawazoe {{were invited to}} attend {{the reconstruction of the}} Ise Shrine. The shrine has been reconstructed every 20years and in 1953 it was the 59th iteration. Normally the reconstruction process was a very closed affair but this time the ceremony was opened to architects and journalists to document the event. The ceremony coincided {{with the end of the}} American Occupation <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> symbolise a new start in Japanese architecture. In 1965 when Tange and Kawazoe published the book Ise: Prototype of Japanese Architecture, he likened the building to a modernist structure: an honest expression of materials, a functional design and prefabricated elements.|$|E
25|$|On {{his arrival}} in Australia for the 1975–76 tour Rowe was being hailed as the best batsman in the world. A century in his second Test innings in Australia {{maintained}} his average at over 70 runs per innings <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> confirm his reputation. The team was humiliated by the Australian side {{over the rest of}} the series and Rowe never regained his previously devastating form.|$|E

It was estimated to have gone extinct c.1200 AD. However remains with disputed dating have suggested that some survived up until at least 1500 AD, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have survived a considerable time in coexistence with humans, before it finally died out.|$|R

John Evelyn also refers to the ceremony in his Diary on the dates of 6 July 1660 and 28 March 1684.|$|E
500|$|According to {{commentator}} Jim Ross, Japanese {{television producer}} TV Asahi did not contact the English-language team during the event; he and Striker announced [...] "by our instincts <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> work out pretty well".

500|$|... what is {{interesting}} about this film, perhaps, is the moment when it was made. It was shot between Munich and the war, and I shot it absolutely impressed, absolutely disturbed {{by the state of}} mind of a part of French society, a part of English society, a part of world society. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me that a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous story. I looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.|$|E

500|$|Another {{recurrent}} {{question is}} how much, if at all, Verdi was influenced by Wagner's comic opera Die Meistersinger. At {{the time of the}} premiere this was a sensitive subject; many Italians were suspicious of or hostile to Wagner's music, and were protective in a nationalistic way of Verdi's reputation. Nevertheless, Verdi's new style was markedly different from that of his popular works of the 1850s and 1860s, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> some to have Wagnerian echoes. In 1999 the critic Andrew Porter wrote, [...] "That Falstaff was Verdi's and Boito's answer to Wagner's Meistersinger seems evident now. But the Italian Falstaff moves more quickly." [...] Toscanini, who did more than anyone else to bring Falstaff into the regular operatic repertoire, commented: ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Graziano and Velton Ray Bunch {{composed}} original {{music for}} the series. Composed by Randy Edelman, the distinctive theme music gained recognition beyond the show's following; in the mid-1990s, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) hired Edelman to provide music for its sports coverage, including National Football League games and the Olympics. The music samples Edelman sent NBC included the Brisco theme, and by 1996 it was being used during coverage of the Olympics. NBC used it again as the theme for their coverage of the 1997 World Series. Edelman said, [...] "It was original, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have the right spirit. It's got a very flowing melody, it's triumphant, {{and it has a}} certain warmth. And it has at the end of it, what all television things like this have, a 'button', an ending flourish that works really well if they need to chop it down into a 15-second thing." [...] Cary Darling said that the [...] "booming" [...] theme song was [...] "part Magnificent Seven, part Aaron Copland and as grand and wide as 'Big Sky Country'".|$|E
500|$|In 1974 Ayers Rock began {{recording}} {{their debut}} album, Big Red Rock, at Festival Records' 24-track studio in Sydney. They were {{dissatisfied with the}} sound, which failed to capture their music's [...] "live" [...] essence, and recorded it live-in-the-studio at Armstrong's in Melbourne that September. Kennedy told Margaret MacIntyre of Rolling Stone Australia, [...] "Doing the album live was an experiment really <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> work." [...] Big Red Rock, released in November, peaked at number 32 on the Kent Music Report album chart. The album had [...] "a more jazz-rock edge" [...] and its single, [...] "Lady Montego" [...] (written by McGuire), was {{a new version of}} a song originally performed by Leo de Castro and Friends. According to Juke Magazine, [...] "the single lifted to push the album, 'Lady Montego'... received three weeks airplay and was then dumped." [...] "Lady Montego" [...] was Ayers Rock's most-aired single in Australia, and Kennedy said: [...] "Without AM radio support you can't sell too well in this country." [...] Juke called their songs [...] "lyrically banal" [...] but said the group compensated with [...] "sheer talent", instrumentally and electronically.|$|E

500|$|Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman {{decided to}} {{alternate}} the episodes between the prime and parallel universes because they [...] "thought {{that the best}} way to really thoroughly tell these stories was to dive into them wholeheartedly... the journey that our heroine is on and then come back over here because [...] is embedded in our team, we have point of view characters in both universes <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> us the perfect opportunity to really explore in a really thorough fulsome way the alternate universe". Wyman elaborated that he felt fans [...] "would really appreciate a mythology in two places", and showing both universes [...] "just presented itself in such a natural organic way to evolution in our storytelling". Fox however was initially worried about the premise's sustainability, and that an episode without Peter or Walter [...] "wouldn't feel like our show anymore," [...] to which Pinkner responded that [...] "not unlike a show like Lost, Fringe has to constantly evolve, to move and grow and go forward, otherwise we'll get bored, the cast will get bored, the audience will get bored". After the first three episodes, both Fox and Warner Bros. became more favorable to the storyline.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the film}} was released, rumors and {{allegations}} began to circulate that Battlefield Earth contained subliminal messages promoting Scientology. Former Scientologist Lawrence Wollersheim, in a press release issued by his group Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network, said that the Church of Scientology [...] "has placed highly advanced subliminal messages in the Battlefield Earth film master to surreptitiously recruit new members from the movie audience {{and to get the}} audience to develop a revulsion for psychiatry and current mental health organizations and practices". Other critics said that the film [...] "is a veiled attempt to gain converts and influence", and that writers were gagged from making connections between Scientology and the film with threats of lawsuits. Warner Bros. dismissed the claims as [...] "silly nonsense", the Church of Scientology denounced them as [...] "hogwash" [...] and the media reacted with skepticism; as the Scottish journalist Duncan Campbell put it, [...] "the only subliminal voice I could detect came about 10minutes into this 121-minute film <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be saying Leeeaaave thisssss cinemmmaaa nooow". When asked about the similarities between the film and Scientology beliefs in intergalactic travel and aliens, church spokesman Aron Mason stated, [...] "That's a pretty crude parallel… You'd have to make some serious leaps of logic to make that comparison." [...] John Travolta also stated that {{the film was}} not inspired by Scientology tenets.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{thought that}} the episode [...] "was 30 Rocks best episode of the season , if not the best episode ever from this young series." [...] Canning also said that [...] "this was just a fantastic, funny episode of 30 Rock. It was also an episode that once again proved the {{character}} of Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), who was completely absent from this half-hour, simply isn't necessary when you've got Tracy Jordan talking to a pigeon on a trash can." [...] Canning rated this episode [...] "9.5 out of 10." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote that [...] "it's not surprising that – in my opinion, at least – it fell juuuuuuust a bit short. It's {{almost as if the}} funniest parts of the Edie Falco story were played by [...] Wiig in the Lifetime movie." [...] He thought that [...] "the 'Liz suspects the neighbor is a terrorist' story played out rather well." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Overall, [...] another splendid [...] My only beef was with the Verizon bit. 30 Rock normally does a splendid job of balancing the corporate elements of television, often utilizing it for comic fodder. But the winking cell phone banter lacked subtlety, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me like the show was trying to have its cake and eat it, too." ...|$|E

500|$|Few female {{respondents}} reported engaging in sex {{play with their}} siblings, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have {{no role in the}} development of sexual preference. Homosexual women were less likely to report having enjoyed typical girls' activities, but more likely to report having enjoyed typical boys' activities, such as football, and to describe themselves as having been very masculine while they were growing up. These and other variables were combined into a [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity" [...] measure, which proved to be the second strongest predictor of homosexuality. Bell et al. noted, however, that childhood gender nonconformity did not seem to have been important in the way proposed by psychoanalytic theory, in that it was not a crucial link between family influences and their respondents' sense of womanhood, and nor was it explained by relationships within the family. Homosexual women were more likely to recall having felt different from other girls their age during grade school and high school years, and to say that they felt different because they were more masculine than other girls, more interested in sports, or not interested in boys. Homosexual women were also more likely to have felt sexually different. However, these feelings did not appear to play a {{role in the development of}} female homosexuality. Homosexual women, unlike heterosexual women, were sometimes labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, but such labeling also appeared to play no significant role in the development of female homosexuality.|$|E
