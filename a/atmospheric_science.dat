The scope of the work ranges from spectroscopy of atmospheric particles to weather prediction. The Encyclopedia of <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Sciences</b> has received an award and three highly positive reviews in just {{the first six months}} after its publication. Broad-ranging articles explore topics such as air pollution, air sea-interactions, biogeochemical cycles, boundary layers, chemistry of the atmosphere, climate variability, clouds, dynamic meteorology, general circulation, global change, hydrology, land-atmosphere interactions, lidar, mesoscale meteorology, numerical models, ocean circulation, ozone, radar, satellite remote sensing and weather prediction...|$|R
25|$|In <b>atmospheric</b> <b>science,</b> {{balanced}} flow is an idealisation of atmospheric motion.

25|$|In 1938, Langmuir's {{scientific}} interests {{began to}} turn to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>science</b> and meteorology. One of his first ventures, although tangentially related, was a refutation of the claim of entomologist Charles H. T. Townsend that the deer botfly flew at speeds of over 800 miles per hour.

McManus, professor of marine biology and ecology at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Science,</b> has explored the possibilities of designating portions of the Spratly Islands as a marine park. One region of the Spratly Archipelago, named Truong Sa, was proposed by Vietnam's Ministry of Science, Technology, and the Environment (MOSTE) as a future protected area. The site, with an area of 160km2 (62sq mi), is currently managed by the Khánh Hòa Provincial People's Committee of Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|The {{consensus}} among geologists and archaeologists {{is that the}} Bimini Road is a natural feature composed of beachrock that orthogonal and other joints have broken up into rectangular, subrectangular, polygonal, and irregular blocks. The geologists and anthropologists who have personally studied the Bimini Road include Eugene Shinn of the U.S. Geological Survey; Marshall McKusick. an Associate Professor of Anthropology at University of Iowa; W. Harrison of Environmental Research Associates, Virginia, Beach Virginia; Mahlon M. Ball and J. A. Gifford of the Rosenstiel School of Marine and <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Science,</b> University of Miami; and Eric Davaud and A. Strasser of the Department of Geology and Paleontology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland. After either inspecting or studying the Bimini Road, they all concluded that it consists of naturally jointed beachrock. John A. Gifford, a professional geologist, spent a significant time studying the geology of the Bimini Islands for his University of Miami Master's thesis about the geology of the Bimini Islands. Calvert and others identified the samples that they dated from the Bimini Wall as being natural beachrock.|$|E
