50|$|How Corona realigned {{savings from}} regular appropriations, {{including}} those for unfilled {{positions in the}} Judiciary, may be evaluated by looking into the Supreme Court’s Statement of <b>Allotment,</b> Obligation and <b>Balances</b> (SAOB) for 2010 submitted to the DBM. The savings for 2008 and 2009, though not accumulated under Corona’s term as Chief Justice, had also been submitted to Congress during the 2011 budget hearing.|$|R

40|$|Convergence of {{accounting}} standards is {{demanded in the}} world of accounts, and accounting standards are going to be unified on a global scale now. It is a problem of performance index that there is in the global tide. That is "Net Income" that will be a past performance index is abolished, and movement to unify "Comprehensive Income" to the performance index is seen. Here, according to FASB, "Comprehensive Income" is the change in equity of an entity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period, except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. In other words it points {{at the beginning of a}} period except capital transactions such as <b>allotment</b> and the <b>balance</b> of net assets of the end of a term. "Comprehensive Income" has already been introduced in the U. S and U. K in Europe and America that is the representative country. Then, the correspondence in the future to our country that has not been introduced yet is considered by making comparative study of "Comprehensive Income" of the two countries...|$|R
500|$|With {{forest land}} allotted by the Government of India, two {{arms of the}} Sera Monastery, {{representing}} the migrant monks of the Tibetan Sera Je and Sera Me colleges were established; 193 Sera je monks got [...] and 107 monks of Sera Me got an <b>allotment</b> of the <b>balance</b> area. Further, 38 tenements were built with grants by the Government of India for the Monks to reside and pursue their vocation of monkshood coupled with tilling the surrounding allotted land for raising food crops for survival. Well established as an organised Monastery with dedicated efforts of the monks, an Assembly Prayer Hall that could accommodate 1500 monks was also completed in 1978. This Monastery is now the nodal monastery, with its affiliation to several smaller monasteries spread across various regions in Tibet; its popularity could be gauged by the 3000 or more monks living here now. Encouraged by this success and noting the pressure on existing infrastructure, an additional, much larger and an impressive Assembly hall (measuring , [...] high with 110 pillars) has been built that can accommodate 3500 monks to assemble for prayers. With this development, Sera has now two facets, the original “Tibetan Sera” and the Bylakuppe “New Sera” of the “Tibetan Diaspora” with the counterpart Jé, Mé monasteries, with the Ngakpa college counterpart also added recently. The Sera-India monk community of the Bylakuppe Monastery, has gone global with their missionary activity by establishing “dharma centers” in many parts the world, thus removing the cultural isolation of pre-1959 years in Tibet.|$|R
50|$|The 14th Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 {{and sought}} asylum there. During {{the month of}} March {{of the same year}} the Sera Jey Monastery had been {{destroyed}} by bombardment, which resulted in death of hundreds of monks (in 1959, the count of monks living in Sera Jey was 5629), apart from destruction of ancient texts and loss of innumerable, invaluable, ancient and antique works of art. Many of those who survived (monks and common people) this onslaught by the Chinese fled to India, under severe winter weather conditions, across the Himalayas. Following this mass exodus of people from Tibet (including, a few hundred Sera Jey lamas, geshes and monks), when they arrived in India, they were resettled at Bylakuppe near Mysore, Karnataka state among many other locations spread across the country, as one of the exclusive Tibetan establishments with ready assistance forthcoming from the Government of India. It was in 1970 that the group of 197 Sera Jey monks with 103 of Sera Mey monks established a special monastery within the resettlement of Bylakuppe as a counterpart of the Tibetan Sera Jey Monastery. As none of the monks of the Ngagpa Dratsang (Tantric College) had survived the invasion, only the Sera Mey College and Sera Jey College were re-formed in India. The Bylakuppe Monastery now houses 5,000 Buddhist monks comprising some migrants and many other Tibetans who were not born in their ancestral homeland.With forest land allotted by the Government of India, two arms of the Sera Monastery, representing the migrant monks of the Tibetan Sera Je and Sera Me colleges were established; 193 Sera je monks got 147.75 acre and 107 monks of Sera Me got an <b>allotment</b> of the <b>balance</b> area.
