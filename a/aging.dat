5|$|Another basic {{unresolved}} {{problem in}} biology is the biologic basis of <b>aging.</b> At present, {{there is no}} consensus view on the underlying cause of <b>aging.</b> Various competing theories are outlined in Ageing Theories.|$|E
5|$|A low calorie diet extends median {{and maximum}} {{lifespan}} in many animals. This effect may involve {{a reduction in}} oxidative stress. While {{there is some evidence}} to support the role of oxidative stress in <b>aging</b> in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems had no effect on <b>aging.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Aging</b> / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional <b>aging,</b> secondary fermentation, or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented tea, is often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation by age or dampness. Additionally, oolong can benefit from <b>aging</b> if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E

5|$|Along with Riesling, Sauvignon blanc {{was one of}} {{the first}} fine wines to be bottled with a screwcap in {{commercial}} quantities, especially by New Zealand producers. The wine is usually consumed young, as it does not particularly benefit from <b>aging,</b> as varietal Sauvignon blancs tend to develop vegetal aromas reminiscent of peas and asparagus with extended <b>aging.</b> Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged examples from Pessac-Léognan and Graves, as well as some Loire wines from Pouilly-Fumé and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with <b>aging</b> potential.|$|E
