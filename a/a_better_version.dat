5|$|The 2015 Fantastic Four {{film was}} the weakest {{reviewed}} of the series; it was criticised for its dark, humorless tone, its character arcs, designs (especially that of Dr. Doom), bland acting, and poorly written story. Josh Trank, {{who directed the}} film, was himself not satisfied, posting a message on Twitter stating he had <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>version</b> of the film, but was ruined by Fox; he later deleted the message.|$|E
5|$|We {{really wanted}} to do {{something}} that just shows who I am. We weren't trying to make <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>version</b> of myself. It was really more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E

25|$|World at War was {{announced}} on June 23, 2008, by Activision, who {{confirmed that the}} game was {{to be released in}} fall 2008, and that the series would revert to its customary World War II setting. The game took about two years to make, twice as long as Treyarch's previous entry to the series, Call of Duty 3. The game is powered by <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>version</b> of the , with several improvements made to the physics model. Environments are more destructible and can be set on fire with the flamethrower, whose fire propagates. Dismemberment, as well as realistic skin and clothes burning of the characters were added.|$|E
500|$|It {{is unknown}} how many poems {{published}} in the Hymns were written before Smart was imprisoned or during his final days, but at least one, titled [...] "Against Despair" [...] was produced during this time. A different version of the poem was published {{after his death in}} the Gentleman's Magazine. This version included a note claiming, [...] "Extempore by the late C.

500|$|... "Women's Appreciation" [...] {{was written}} by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, while Tucker Gates served as the episode's director. The cold open {{featuring}} Jim receiving a demerit from Dwight was initially intended for [...] "Business School", {{and the opening of}} [...] "Product Recall", which featured Jim and Dwight impersonating each other, was first intended for this episode before it was moved because of time constraints. Michael's talking head scene about Jan's safeword was meant to serve as a [...] "place holder" [...] until <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>version</b> could be shot, but was left in the episode because the writers forgot about it. While the characters travel to Mall at Steamtown, a shopping center in Scranton, Pennsylvania, episode filming actually took place near Los Angeles, where the series is normally shot.|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff {{rated the}} episode an [...] "A", finding it [...] "exhilarating" [...] despite its {{seemingly}} nonsensical plot. However, VanDerWerff {{felt that the}} episode moved at a constant and entertaining pace, and that it and [...] "Roosters" [...] never felt stretched out longer than they should have been. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 5 out of 5, writing that it [...] "poses amazing questions while precisely and purposefully offering up the answers". Gibron felt that the episode was a perfect summation of the themes which had been hinted at in the earlier episode [...] "Beware of the Dog", and would {{set the tone for}} the season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Owls" [...] three-and-a-half stars out of five. Shearman felt the episode was entertaining and fun, but that its plot was confusing and cluttered. However, he felt that the episode served as <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>version</b> of [...] "The Hand of St. Sebastian", with the slower pace of a two-part episode allowing for greater [...] "gravitas" [...] to be given to the storyline.|$|E

2500|$|The game {{features}} a passive form of crafting, known as Crew Skills, {{in which a}} player's companions carry out gathering and crafting tasks asynchronously to the player's adventures out in the world. [...] Each class gets five companions via their storyline. The player can assign up to five companions to perform up to 3 various skills. Crafting skills allow the player's companions to create items, and the player can reverse engineer many items to possibly learn to make <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>version.</b> The item is destroyed in the process, but the player gets some of the materials back. Gathering skills allow the player or their companions to gather resources out in the world. Mission skills allow the player's companions to perform acts on the player's behalf, gaining the player Light or Darkside influence and other rewards, such as medical items or companion gifts.|$|E
2500|$|The first demo session {{occurred}} in January 2010 with Welch and Paul Epworth {{at a small}} London studio. Numerous producers {{expressed an interest in}} working on the album but Welch rejected the offers because she wanted Ceremonials to be <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>version</b> of Lungs with a [...] "more dark, more heavy, bigger drum sounds, bigger bass, but with more of a whole sound". For {{the rest of the year}} work on the album continued only intermittently as the band concentrated on an extensive tour of the US, where Lungs had become popular. The majority of the writing for the album was done between January and April 2011, with recording taking place in April at Abbey Road Studios. Refinement took place at Epworth's own London studios while Welch recorded vocal tracks in various US studios, during days off from touring. The final recording session took place in July at Epworth's studio. Epworth co-wrote seven tracks. Several other British writers share credits on the album, including Summers, Kid Harpoon, James Ford and composer Eg White.|$|E
2500|$|In 1866, Doctor John Stith-Pemberton, started {{experimenting with}} opium-free drugs in {{attempts}} to cure his morphine addiction due to an injury he sustained while fighting in the Civil War in April 1865. He later created a product he called French Wine Coca, which he admitted was an imitation but <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>version</b> of then popular Vin Mariani by Parisian chemist Angelo Mariani. Pemberton’s French Wine Coca was composed of 3 main ingredients. Pemberton’s advertisement read [...] " [...] the medical virtues of the Erythroxylon Coca plant of Peru, South America — African Cola Nuts — true Damiana, with pure Grape Wine." [...] The difference between Pemberton’s French Wine Coca and Angelo Mariani’s Vin Mariani was that Pemberton’s French Wine Coca was made of two additional ingredients that Vin Mariani did not have. Vin Mariani was simply made with Bordeaux wine and coca leaves. Pemberton’s French Wine Coca quickly became very popular until a vote by the state legislature Atlanta and Fulton County in favour of the national temperance movement.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>better</b> quality <b>version</b> of <b>a</b> heterodyne, {{or direct}} conversion, bat {{detector}} is the super-heterodyne detector. In {{this case the}} bat signal is mixed with a high frequency oscillator, typically around 450-600 kHz. The difference frequency is then amplified and filtered in an 'intermediate frequency' or i.f. amplifier before being converted back to audible frequencies again. This design, {{which is based on}} standard radio design, gives improved frequency discrimination and avoids problems with interference from the local oscillator.|$|R

Improvements included passenger grab rails, door pull handles, seat kick plates, heavy-duty seats, floor mats, a heavy-duty battery and a boot lid handle. The Business Sedan was officially designated as model 48-215-257. Like the basic Holden sedan, it was powered by a 132.5 cubic inch six cylinder engine.|$|R
2500|$|The Bene Gesserit {{become the}} {{consumers}} of Idaho gholas in Heretics of Dune (1984) and Chapterhouse Dune (1985). [...] However, the gholas are repeatedly assassinated after several years, and the Sisterhood suspect the Tleilaxu. Not knowing exactly what purpose Idaho will serve, the Bene Gesserit {{believe that the}} Tleilaxu are using the gholas to control the timing of his release upon the universe, implying some Tleilaxu purpose {{in addition to their}} own. [...] The current ghola survives such an attempt and Miles Teg is able to restore the memories of Duncan Idaho to the ghola, but Duncan can feel that the Tleilaxu planted something else in his mind. When Murbella, an Honored Matre, tries to sexually bond Idaho, he entraps and enslaves her, revealing the Tleilaxu purpose: To conquer the Honored Matres by using <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>version</b> of their own sexual techniques. When Murbella tries to bond Duncan, the Tleilaxu's plan comes to fruition, and he becomes aware of the memories of all the other Idaho gholas, though he is also imprinted to her. It is later determined that the Tleilaxu had mixed the cells from almost all of the Idaho gholas to make this one. Idaho and Murbella are confined to a no-ship on Chapterhouse. [...] There, Idaho trains young men {{to go out into the}} universe and enslave Honored Matres. [...] Duncan also inherits an awkward prescient vision, wherein he sees an old man and woman staring back at him. Duncan restores the memories of the Miles Teg ghola, and escapes in the no-ship, evading the trap set for him by the strange couple.|$|E
