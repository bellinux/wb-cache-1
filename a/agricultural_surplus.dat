5|$|Rural {{families}} that sold a large <b>agricultural</b> <b>surplus</b> {{to the market}} not only could afford to buy more charcoal, tea, oil, and wine, but they could also amass enough funds to establish secondary means of production for generating more wealth. Besides necessary agricultural foodstuffs, farming families could often produce wine, charcoal, paper, textiles, and other goods they sold through brokers. Farmers in Suzhou often specialized in raising bombyx mori to produce silk wares, while in Fujian, Sichuan, and Guangdong farmers often grew sugarcane. In order to ensure the prosperity of rural areas, technical applications for public works projects and improved agricultural techniques were essential. The vast irrigation system of China had to be furnished with multitudes of wheelwrights mass-producing standardized waterwheels and square-pallet chain pumps that could lift water from lower planes to higher irrigation planes.|$|E

In 1892, the newly constructed town with its growing <b>agricultural</b> <b>surplus</b> was added to the British rail network.

5000|$|However, the key shift {{involved}} {{the status of}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>surpluses.</b> Rather than simply requisitioning <b>agricultural</b> <b>surpluses</b> in order to feed the urban population (the hallmark of War Communism), the NEP allowed peasants to sell their surplus yields on the open market. Meanwhile, the state still maintained state ownership of what Lenin deemed the [...] "commanding heights" [...] of the economy: heavy industry such as the coal, iron, and metallurgical sectors along with the banking and financial components of the economy.

25|$|Dr. Marcella Alsan argues the {{prevalence}} of the tsetse fly hampered early state formation in Africa. Because the tsetse virus was lethal to cows and horses, communities afflicted by the insect could not rely on the agricultural benefits provided by livestock. African communities were prevented from stockpiling <b>agricultural</b> <b>surplus,</b> working the land, or eating meat. Because the disease environment hindered the formation of farming communities, early African societies resembled small hunter-gatherer groups and not centralized states.|$|E
25|$|Although Emperor Wen {{was famous}} for bankrupting the state {{treasury}} with warfare and construction projects, he made many improvements to infrastructure during his early reign. He established granaries as sources of food and {{as a means to}} regulate market prices from the taxation of crops, much like the earlier Han dynasty. The large <b>agricultural</b> <b>surplus</b> supported rapid growth of population to historical peak, which was only surpassed at the zenith of Tang Dynasty more than a century later.|$|E

5000|$|The {{juxtaposition}} of huge <b>agricultural</b> <b>surpluses</b> {{and the many}} deaths due to insufficient food shocked many, {{as well as some}} of the administrative decisions that happened under the Agricultural Adjustment Act. For example, in an effort to reduce <b>agricultural</b> <b>surpluses,</b> the government paid farmers to reduce crop production and to sell pregnant sows as well as young pigs. Oranges were being soaked with kerosene to prevent their consumption and corn was being burned as fuel because it was so cheap. There were many people, however, as well as livestock in different places starving to death. Farmers slaughtered livestock because feed prices were rising, and they could not afford to feed their own animals. Under the Agricultural Adjustment Act, [...] "plowing under" [...] of pigs was also common to prevent them reaching a reproductive age, as well as donating pigs to the Red Cross.|$|R

Evidence from excavations such as extensive pottery and the earliest known tablets of writing support these events. Excavation of Uruk is highly complex because older buildings were recycled into newer ones, thus blurring the layers of different historic periods. The topmost layer most likely originated in the Jemdet Nasr period (3100–2900 BC) and is built on structures from earlier periods dating back to the Ubaid period.|$|E
25|$|After {{defeating}} Koxinga's private army, the Qing {{government had}} no interest in improving the economy of Taiwan, calling it an uncivilized land (huawai zhi di). Therefore, the economic activities mostly came from the settlements of migrants. The most significant economic development during this time period was the establishment of irrigation systems and hydraulic engineering projects. The <b>agricultural</b> <b>surplus</b> caused by these improvements led to the export of rice to mainland China. On the other hand, the commercial activities continued throughout major trading ports. Tainan, Lukang, and Banka became the three largest cities in Taiwan.|$|E

Agricultural tools and carts, some water-powered, allowed the production of a sizable <b>agricultural</b> <b>surplus,</b> which formed the basis of the rural economy. Alongside other crops, rice was grown on a large scale. The population growth and the decrease in fertile land made it necessary that farmers produce cash crops to earn a living. Landed, managed estates grew substantially; while in 1379 only 14,241 households had over 700 mou, {{by the end of the}} Ming some large landowners had over 70,000 mou.

During his time in the House, McGovern was regarded as a liberal overall, and voted in accordance with the rated positions of Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) 34 times and against 3 times. Two of the themes of his House career, improvements for rural America and the war on hunger, would be defining ones of his legislative career and public life.|$|E
500|$|Moses Finley was {{the chief}} proponent of the primitivist view that the Roman economy was [...] "underdeveloped and underachieving," [...] {{characterized}} by subsistence agriculture; urban centres that consumed more than they produced in terms of trade and industry; low-status artisans; slowly developing technology; and a [...] "lack of economic rationality." [...] Current views are more complex. Territorial conquests permitted a large-scale reorganization of land use that resulted in <b>agricultural</b> <b>surplus</b> and specialization, particularly in north Africa. Some cities were known for particular industries or commercial activities, and the scale of building in urban areas indicates a significant construction industry. Papyri preserve complex accounting methods that suggest elements of economic rationalism, and the Empire was highly monetized. Although the means of communication and transport were limited in antiquity, transportation in the 1st and 2nd centuries expanded greatly, and trade routes connected regional economies. The supply contracts for the army, which pervaded {{every part of the}} Empire, drew on local suppliers near the base (castrum), throughout the province, and across provincial borders. The Empire is perhaps best thought of as a network of regional economies, based on a form of [...] "political capitalism" [...] in which the state monitored and regulated commerce to assure its own revenues. Economic growth, though not comparable to modern economies, was greater than that of most other societies prior to industrialization.|$|E
2500|$|There, generally, was surplus {{from the}} produce. Each village was almost {{self-sufficient}} and if necessary people bought additional commodities from neighboring villages.

40|$|Using cointegration techniques, we {{estimate}} two models that capture the long-term relationship between Spanish prices and agricultural production.

The models, as well as plausible counterfactual scenarios constructed to assess the production changes induced by the CAP, lead to three principal results. First, we find that Spanish agricultural output is responsive to agricultural prices. Second, we find that the MacSharry reforms have been instrumental in restraining agricultural production. Third, we find that Spanish agricultural output would have been higher if Spain had not applied the CAP. These results are important and have broad implications. First, they strengthen the position of those reformers both within and outside of Europe that argue for lower price supports as an appropriate policy for stemming European <b>agricultural</b> <b>surpluses.</b> Second, they indicate that recent EU reforms, which have in effect extended the MacSharry reforms, are appropriate measures for curbing European <b>agricultural</b> <b>surpluses.</b> Keywords: Price Support Policy; MacSharry Reforms; Cointegration Techniques; European Economic Integration. ...|$|R
