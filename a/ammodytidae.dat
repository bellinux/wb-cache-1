5000|$|Ammodytes americanus, {{also known}} as American sand lance, American sand eel, and sand launce, is a small fish in the family <b>Ammodytidae.</b> First {{described}} by James Ellsworth De Kay in 1842, it is widespread in the western North Atlantic. Like all sand lances, it has a long, thin body with a pointed snout; mature fish typically range from 4 to 6 in in length, though some may reach 7 in. Its back is greenish-brown, while its sides and abdomen are silvery. It has a long, low dorsal fin (described as [...] "very delicate") which extends along most of its back, folding into a groove at the fin's base when not in use. Its anal fin is roughly the same height as the dorsal fin, and extends over the posterior third of the fish's body. Its pectoral fins are small, and its caudal fin is forked. Its mouth is large and toothless, with a lower jaw that extends well beyond the upper. It typically travels in large schools, spending most of its time relatively near the water surface. It feeds primarily on plankton, though it is known to take small clams and snails from the sea floor, presumably when plankton is scarce. Towards dusk, schools of A. americanus bury themselves in sand, typically from 1 to 6 in below the sand's surface close to the water's edge; they avoid rocky areas. They do this to avoid being detected by night-hunting species such as bluefish and stripers.|$|E
5000|$|A sand lance or {{sandlance}} is a fish {{belonging to}} the family <b>Ammodytidae.</b> Several species of sand lances {{are commonly known as}} [...] "sand eels", though they are not related to true eels. Another variant name is launce, and all names of the fish are references to its slender body and pointed snout. The family name (and genus name, Ammodytes) means [...] "sand burrower", which describes the sand lance's habit of burrowing into sand to avoid tidal currents. Sand lances are most commonly encountered by fishermen in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, but are found in oceans throughout the world. These fish do not have pelvic fins and do not develop swim bladders, staying true to their bottom-dwelling habit as adults. Both adult and larval sea lances primarily feed on copepods. Larval forms of this fish are perhaps the most abundant of all fish larvae in areas such as the northwest Atlantic, serving as a major food item for cod, salmon, whales and other commercially important species. As adults, sand lances are harvested commercially in some areas (primarily in Europe), leading to direct human competition with diving birds such as puffins, auks, terns, and cormorants. Some species are inshore coastal dwellers, and digging for sand lances to use as a bait fish has been a popular pastime in coastal areas of Europe and North America. Other species are deep-water dwellers, some of which have only recently been described to science, and most of which lack common names.Sand lances have chameleon-like independent eye movements.|$|E

40|$|Highly {{specialised}} piscivorous seabirds, like Sandwich Terns Sterna sandvicensis {{have limited}} capacity {{to switch to}} alternative prey species when {{the availability of a}} particular prey species is low. Therefore, variations in the diet of such species are likely to reflect fluctuations in food availability. We studied food provisioning of Sandwich Tern chicks on Griend in 1992 - 98. The chicks were pre-dominantly fed with Clupeidae and <b>Ammodytidae.</b> About 75 % of the fish brought to the colony were eaten by the chicks. The rest was lost, mainly to robbing Black-headed Gulls Larus ridibundus. Parents met the increasing energy demands of the growing chicks by adjusting prey size, rather than increas-ing the rate of prey transport to the chicks. Distinct patterns in food transport rate, diet composition and prey size were associated with weather conditions and diurnal or tidal rhythms. Food transport to the colony was severely curtailed by strong winds, but was also relatively low at low wind speeds. Wind speed also had a large impact on prey size and diet composition, with a decreasing proportion of Clupeidae brought to the chicks as foraging conditions became worse. Distinct diurnal rhythms in food transport coincided with diel vertical migration patterns in Clupeidae and <b>Ammodytidae.</b> Clupeidae were mostly brought to the colony {{early in the morning and}} late in the evening, while the transport of <b>Ammodytidae</b> was highest around noon. Tidal patterns in food delivery rate were proba-bly related to tide-specific foraging areas used by the terns. A fish-monitoring programme showed considerable variation in food abundance within the foraging area of the terns. Especially Clupeidae had a patchy distribution and most clupeids were caught in the coastal areas around Vlieland. In accordance to the pattern found in the colony, Clupeidae caught in 1996 and 1997 towards fledging of the chicks and in 1998 just after hatching of the chicks in 1998 were relatively small...|$|E

40|$|Local {{differences}} in feeding conditions {{have been suggested}} {{as a cause of}} regional variation in seabird demography but multi-colony comparisons of diet are rare. In UK waters the main fish eaten by seabirds during the breeding season belong to three families: <b>Ammodytidae,</b> Clupeidae and Gadidae. Climate change and fishing are affecting these fish stocks and so probably impact on predators such as seabirds. We used standardized observations of prey brought in for chicks to make the first integrated assessment of the diet of Common Guillemot Uria aalge chicks at a UK scale. Chick diet varied markedly among the 23 colonies sampled between 2006 and 2011. Sandeels (<b>Ammodytidae),</b> probably Lesser Sandeels Ammodytes marinus, were the commonest prey. Their contribution to the diet varied both latitudinally and among marine regions, with the proportion significantly higher for a given latitude on the west coast compared to the east. The non-sandeel component of the diet showed latitudinal changes, with small clupeids, probably Sprats Sprattus sprattus, predominant at southern colonies whereas juvenile gadids were the main alternative to sandeels in the north. Comparison of our Guillemot chick diet with data collected 15 – 30 years earlier suggests that the proportion of sandeels in the diet has decreased at colonies bordering the North Sea. No significant change was apparent in Atlantic colonies but historical data were limited. The early years of our study coincided with a population explosion of Snake Pipefish Entelurus aequoreus in the Northeast Atlantic and North Sea. Pipefish were recorded in Guillemot chick diet at several northern and northwestern colonies in 2006 and 2007 but have been absent since 2009. Spatial and temporal variation in chick diet accorded broadly with patterns expected as a result of rising sea temperatures and impacts of fishing. Guillemot chick diet could potentially be a useful indicator of changes in the distribution and abundance of forage fish. ...|$|E

To assess variability in species composition and spatiotemporal occurrence in ichthyoplankton in the southeast Beaufort Sea, we sampled larval and juvenile fish using square-conical nets in the upper water column (75 % of total catches every month. Cottidae and Liparidae usually followed Gadidae, together representing 9 – 94 % of non-gadid species in number. The majority of dominant and subdominant species occurred ubiquitously through the sampling area, whereas Gymnocanthus tricuspis (Cottidae), Liparis gibbus (Liparidae), and Leptoclinus maculatus (Stichaeidae) occurred abundantly on the Mackenzie Shelf. In contrast, Triglops nybelini (Cottidae) was frequently found in the Amundsen Gulf, which was characterized by higher salinities (> 25). Exceptional species composition was observed in September 2011, when Ammodytes hexapterus (<b>Ammodytidae)</b> numerically accounted for 67 % of non-gadid species.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} decade, the {{distribution}} of harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena has undergone a southward shift in the North Sea, {{which has led to}} {{an increase in the number}} of stranded porpoises in its southern part. Since the changes in distribution and relative abundance of porpoises may be linked to the changes in prey availability, the aim of the present work was to investigate whether any changes in the feeding habits of harbour porpoises along the North Sea occurred in the past decade. The diet of harbour porpoises stranded along the southern North Sea (northern France and Belgian coast) was assessed through 3 complementary methods: stomach content analysis, stable isotopes (carbon and nitrogen) analysis determined from muscle samples, and fatty acids analysis determined from blubber samples. Fatty acid patterns and stable isotope values from 52 porpoises were compared to 14 potential prey species collected from the southern North Sea. Our results showed that the diet of porpoises along the southern North Sea comprises fish species that are among the most abundant and widely distributed in the area, except for the sardine Sardina pilchardus that appeared to be a new potential prey. Moreover, our results suggested that the decline in sandeel (<b>Ammodytidae)</b> in the northern parts of the North Sea along with the re-invasion of the southern North Sea by sardine species might affect {{the distribution of}} harbour porpoises...|$|E

An active predator, it feeds primarily on fish, crustaceans and cephalopods. Dur-ing 15 years since the only previous large-scale study of the diet of this species in Scottish waters, there have been substantial changes in marine fish abundances. The present study evaluates sources of variation (temporal, ontogenetic) in diet composition and prey size preferences of L. forbesii, including a comparison of contemporary (July 2006 –June 2007) and historical (1990 – 1992) dietary datasets. Results revealed sig-nificant size-related and seasonal variation in diet composition and prey size. Teleost fish of the families <b>Ammodytidae</b> and Gobiidae were eaten by squid of all sampled sizes, although occurrence of gobies was generally more frequent in smaller squids, while Gadidae were eaten more frequently by larger squids. Cannibalism was also more frequent in larger squids.

It {{was influenced by}} chick age and obviously also by prey availability. The numbers of fulmars attending the colonies were influenced by wind direction, wind speed, time of day and state of reproduction. Diet samples were collected by regurgitations of adult and young fulmars. Diet was analysed by identifying prey items {{on the basis of}} otoliths, vertebrae, premaxillae (fish), cephalopod beaks and fragments of arthropod exoskeletons. Adult fulmars and chicks fed upon a wide range of prey types. Gadoid fish, including Norway pout (Trisopterus esmarkii), were the most common prey in the diet. Fish offal was found in 32 % of regurgitates, clupeids in 15 %. In contrast, the proportions of sandeels were very low (1 %). This is different from previous studies where sandeels formed a large part of fulmar diet at Shetland in summer. Differences in food composition of incubating and chick-rearing fulmars were found for fish, but not for offal, crustaceans or squid. The percentage of non-discard fish (Clupeidae, <b>Ammodytidae,</b> Isospondylae) was significantly different between regurgitates from incubating and chick- rearing fulmars. Samples from chick-rearing adults contained non-discard items more frequently than regurgitates from incubating birds.

Predation of eggs and larvae is normally considered to be a major factor but the full suite of predators responsible has rarely been identified. Potential predators on a patch of plaice Pleuronectes platessa eggs located in the eastern Irish Sea were mapped using acoustics and sampled by trawl and a plankton multi-net. Gut contents of 3373 fish, crustacea and cephalopods sampled in the area were screened using a plaice-specific TaqMan DNA probe. Herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus dominated trawl catches and showed high positive TaqMan responses (77 and 75 % of individuals tested respectively). Locations of clupeid schools also broadly corresponded with the distribution of fish eggs in the plankton. Whiting Merlangius merlangus were also reasonably abundant in trawl hauls and 86 % of their stomachs tested positive for plaice DNA. Species showing lower levels of positive TaqMan response included mackerel Scomber scombrus, poor cod Trisopterus minutus, squid Loligo spp., dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula and weever Trachinus vipera. Non-reactivity of all negative controls precluded the occurrence of cross-contamination, and positive reactions from demersal species, such as dogfish and weever, may have resulted from secondary predation. No benthic macro-crustaceans tested positive. Samples of planktonic organisms yielded 13 % positive TaqMan reactions, mainly from clupeoid or sandeel (<b>Ammodytidae)</b> larvae, but also included some Malacostraca and Amphipoda.

Sampling was conducted from August 2002 to October 2003, always at full moon, at low tide and high tide in daylight hours, at the water column using a 48  cm diameter plankton net with 335  [mu]m mesh. Analysis of the physico-chemical parameters pointed out the spatial (horizontal) homogeneity of the sampling area. Fish larvae from 41 taxa belonging to 17 families were identified; Blenniidae, Labridae, <b>Ammodytidae,</b> Clupeidae, Gobiidae, Soleidae and Gobiesocidae were the most representative during the study period. Parablennius gattorugine, Ammodytes tobianus, Symphodus melops, Sardina pilchardus, Lipophrys pholis and Coryphoblennius galerita were the most representative species (percentage contribution to total abundance). Peak abundance of fish eggs occurred during May, June and August 2003 and fish larvae occurred during May and July 2003 and August 2002 and 2003; there was a pronounced winter/early spring (March 2003) peak in larval abundance dominated by the small sandeel A. tobianus. This study identifies the occurrence of a conspicuous assemblage of larval fishes at very nearshore shallow environments of a variety of species with different adult habitats: the fish larvae assemblage was dominated by intertidal species.

Variations in microchemical fingerprints of 13 trace elements are performed with a Femtosecond LA-ICPM from the core to the margin of sagittal otolith and are compared within and between otoliths extracted from 34 fishes sampled in three different sites along the coast of the south-western English Channel in France. Firstly, preliminary investigations on the validity of the method revealed that Mg/Ca was the only ratio significantly dependant on fish ontogeny and sampling season. Secondly, the Mn/Ca, Zn/Ca, and Cu/Ca ratios enabled us to significantly discriminate among sampling sites. Thirdly, microchemical fingerprints of each life stage varied significantly among sampling sites but not within them, suggesting high site fidelity over relatively short distances. Finally, the fingerprints of all life stages were significantly different from those of the larval and metamorphosis stages. The otolith microchemistry could detect change of signature relative to the shift from a pelagic behaviour to a resident bentho-pelagic behaviour during the middle of the juvenile stage in Small Sandeels. Hence, analysis of trace element fingerprints in otoliths appears to be a valuable method to further studies on ontogenic habitat change, population mixing and variation of life history and be helpful for the management at local or regional scales of short-lived species such as those belonging to other <b>Ammodytidae...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract The harbour {{porpoise}} (Phocoena phocoena) {{is probably the}} most abundant small cetacean in the northeast Atlantic and as such is an important top predator. It {{is also one of the}} most threatened species, particularly as a consequence of fishery by-catch. Porpoises feed mainly on small shoaling fishes from both demersal and pelagic habitats. Many prey items are probably taken on, or very close to, the sea bed. Even though a wide range of species has been recorded in the diet, porpoises in any one area tend to feed primarily on two to four main species (e. g. whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and sandeels (<b>Ammodytidae)</b> in Scottish waters). Evidence for selective predation is equivocal. Many studies provide evidence of geographic, seasonal, interannual, ontogenetic or sexual differences in prey types or prey sizes, and such dif-ferences are often (speculatively) interpreted in terms of prey availability. A few studies demon-strate trends in diet selection that are consistent with changes in prey abundance. However, lack of availability of prey abundance data at an appropriate spatial and temporal scale is often a problem. Porpoise diets overlap extensively with diets of other piscivorous marine predators (notably seals). Many of the main prey species are also taken by commercial fisheries, although por-poises tend to take smaller fishes than those targeted by fisheries. Given their high abundance, porpoises clearly remove substantial quantities of fish. The literature on porpoise diets in the northeast Atlantic suggests that there has been a long-term shift from predation on clupeid fish (mainly herring Clupea harengus) to predation on sandeels and gadoid fish, possibly related to the decline in herring stocks since the mid- 1960 s. Evidence from studies on seals suggests that such a shift could have adverse health con-sequences. Food consumption brings porpoises into contact with two important threats – persistent organic contaminants and fishing nets, both of which have potentially serious impacts...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the biology of, and fishery for, L. piscatorius was {{investigated}} {{primarily in the}} area around the Shetland Islands and several new findings have emerged. It was found that catch rates in the commercial fishery were generally between 5 and 15 individuals per hour towing time although there were differences between grounds and between seasons. There was evidence of a negative trend in fish size over time on one of the main fishing grounds {{during the course of this}} study. A bigger-deeper trend was found and at inshore areas a negative trend between CPUE and depth was also found. Some inshore areas may act as nursery areas. A tagging study was undertaken and recapture locations indicated a pattern of offshore migration during the autumn and winter. Some movement between different inshore grounds also occurred. The mean growth rate obtained from recaptured fish was 9 cm/year, similar to the 8 - 12 cm/year estimated from cohorts identified in length-frequency distributions. These tended to be higher than growth rates predicted from age determinations using otoliths. Lengths-at-ages given in this study tended to be higher than those previously reported. Analysis of the diet suggested opportunistic feeding, with both seasonal and geographical variation recorded. Gadoids were important, particularly during the winter and spring but sandeel (<b>Ammodytidae</b> spp.) dominated the diet during the summer. In situ feeding behaviour, including a direct opportunistic attack on a cod, was described for the first time and several behaviours, previously unrecorded in the species, e. g. recess creation using digging and scraping behaviours, breath holding, and spine raising in relation to the proximity of potential prey, were identified. "Walking" behaviour, using the paired fins, was also described. The autumn offshore migration may be related to changes in prey availability and / or the reproductive cycle.

40|$|International audienceAn {{integrated}} {{research program}} was initiated to evaluate if the European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis {{can be used}} as a robust indicator of the marine environment in Mor Braz, Brittany, France. This program focuses on aspects of the ecology of the shag including its abundance, demography, diet and at-sea distribution measured at three breeding colonies. The annual population growth rate was estimated at 1. 01 for the period 1987 - 2009. The number of breeding pairs (mean: 565) was highly variable from year to year. Part of this interannual variation was explained by variations in sea surface temperature and sea surface height in winter and spring: the number of breeding pairs was negatively related to sea surface temperature and sea surface height. First year, second year and adult survival probabilities were 0. 44, 0. 76 and 0. 81, respectively. Juvenile survival rate varied between colonies, despite the short distances separating these islets. Average productivity was one young fledged per nest, but it varied between years and islets. Density of individuals at sea varied between 1. 40 ind. km− 2 during the breeding season and 3. 08 ind. km− 2 after the breeding season had ended. Individuals foraged up to 7 km from the nest and performed on average 2. 7 foraging trips per day. The average number of dives deeper than 5 m varied from 126 to 400 per day. Mean diving depth, dive duration and time spent at bottom were 13 m, 28 s, and 19 s respectively. Regurgitated pellets were collected regularly. Four fish families (Gadidae, Gobiidae, Atherinidae and Labridae) represented more than 65 % of the preys throughout the year, a percentage reaching more than 95 % of the prey from May to October. The other fish in the diet were Cottidae, <b>Ammodytidae,</b> and Clupeidae. The diet of the European shag consisted of benthic fish throughout the year, and also included pelagic fish more frequently between June and October. The synchronous variations of productivity between colonies suggest that some common environmental factors affect this demographic parameter at the regional scale. Thus, the European shag has a good potential for being a reliable ecological indicator of the state of this marine environment. Finally, improved knowledge on the foraging ecology of shags will be useful in the process of designing Marine Protected Areas in the Mor Braz to help ensure sustainable management of marine resources and biodiversity conservation...|$|E
40|$|The harbour {{porpoise}} Phocoena phocoena {{is currently the}} most abundant marine mammal in Belgian waters. Large-scale changes {{in the distribution of}} this top predator in the North Sea have occurred during the last decades, possibly caused by changes in food availability. An analysis of the strandings database 1970 - 2011, containing data on 737 {{harbour porpoise}}s, revealed that throughout the year two peaks in strandings occurred: one in spring, for an important part caused by the strandings of animals incidentally bycaught in fishing gear, and a second one during summer. Most of the stranded animals were juveniles, with a higher percentage of males than females. As could be expected, bycaught animals were on average heavier than equally sized naturally died animals, and they had a thicker blubber layer. In naturally died animals the blubber layer was thicker in winter than in summer, illustrating the insulating function of the blubber layer besides its function as an energy storage. We investigated the stomach content of 64 harbour porpoises washed ashore or bycaught in Belgium between 1997 and 2011. Ten of the stomachs were empty. Fish contributed to most of the prey remains. In total we found the remains of 19 fish species belonging to 10 families. The numerically most important prey items in juveniles were gobies (Gobiidae). Reconstructing the original weight of the prey items revealed that gobies constituted the most important prey by weight, but that larger sandeels (<b>Ammodytidae)</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} gadoids (Gadidae) were also important. In adults the majority of prey items were gobies and sandeels, but the reconstructed weight of the stomach content revealed that sandeels and gadoids constituted by far the most important prey. Surprisingly, clupeids (Clupeidae) did not contribute much to the diet, although the return of the harbour porpoise is often linked to an increase in herring Clupea harengu stocks in the southern North Sea. Also no twaite shad Alosa fallax were found, although this diadromic fish is common again in the area. A small number of smelt Osmerus eperlanus was found in some of the recently stranded harbour porpoises. Smelt is a diadromic fish of which densities are increasing from very low levels. The fact that juvenile harbour porpoises had apparently fed on large quantities of small bottom fish may help to explain why they were more prone to bycatch than adults. The analysis revealed that a gradual shift occurs in the feeding habits of harbour porpoises while becoming adults: from small benthic fish towards larger fish taken from the water column...|$|E
40|$|Long, {{consistent}} and uninterrupted monitoring resulting in time series of biological and environmental data {{are needed to}} understand the relations between environment and species, and species interactions, which also affect fish stock production and thereby fisheries (Dragesund et al. 2008). Traditional fishery science in the Barents Sea has mainly focused on the commercially important species (e. g. cod, haddock, capelin and herring). However, the conducted surveys provide {{a substantial amount of}} data on additional species, and thereby the opportunity to study a wider range of species, species interactions, community structure and ecosystem processes required for an ecosystem-based management (Michalsen et al. 2013, ICES 2016). This aspect {{has been the focus of}} this thesis, which aim is to 1) evaluate monitoring data for use in ecosystem studies, 2) understand past and current changes in the pelagic compartment of the Barents Sea ecosystem, and 3) determine the effects of the recent warming on the pelagic compartment and its components. Since 1965 the international 0 -group fish surveys and since 2004 joint Barents Sea ecosystem surveys have provided an early estimate of year class strength and huge amounts of additional data. The thesis is based on pelagic catch data and information from these autumn surveys reported in a series of nine papers. The monitoring data were quality checked and only pelagic trawl station of satisfactory quality were used to establish time series of 0 -group fish abundance (9 species) and biomass (4 species), biomass and abundance of juveniles and adults lumpfish, biomass of krill and jellyfish and spatially resolved biomass time series of pelagic compartment. Through this work, the databases have been updated and now data are available for the scientific community. An evaluation of sampling equipment and the observation methods indicated limitations of past and current monitoring that may have lead to increased variance and biases. Further development of survey equipment and observation methods are suggested, including modifications of current or development of a new pelagic trawl, use of acoustic recordings of krill and the further development of “DeepVision” and software for automated image analyses. Nevertheless, despite samplings limitations these time series gives new insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics in the pelagic compartment and improves opportunities to study key interactions in the pelagic food web. The period from 1980 to 2015 can be broadly divided into four segments based on differences in oceanographic and biological (krill, jellyfish, 0 -group fish and lumpfish abundance time series) variables with break points in 1986, 1994 and 2004. The period 1980 - 2015, which is the period considered here, is characterized by warming from a cold and relatively low-productive system to a warm (but variable temperature condition) and slightly more productive, to a record warm (with largest areas of warm waters) and high-productive pelagic system. The pelagic organisms, such as zooplankton, fish egg and larvae drift with ocean currents into the Barents Sea directly and immediately respond to change in water flux, temperature and distribution of water masses. Krill, jellyfish and 0 -group fish (such as cod, haddock, herring and capelin) showed interannual variations in abundance and distribution, but demonstrated a general trend over the sampling period as it increased from a cold 1980 s to the record warm 2000 s. These organisms were found mostly in the warm Atlantic and mixed water masses. In addition to larger occupation area, 0 -group capelin showed also northwards distribution shift, which was correlated with increased temperature and areas of Atlantic and mixed waters. The northward shift may have reduced the overlap with young herring, which in turn can have had a positive effect on capelin recruitment, as herring predation on capelin larvae may significantly reduce capelin recruitment success. 0 -group polar cod abundance and distribution decreased during the period. Poor recruitment in recent decades and poorer body condition during and after the spawning may have already resulted in reduced abundance in response to the warm climate. Variable recruitment of fish stocks is a major source of variability in stock development and for the dynamics of the Barents Sea ecosystem. The biomass of 0 -group fish contributes directly to the pelagic biomass and the plankton-feeding component and subsequently as juveniles and adults over the following years. Among small non-commercially fish <b>Ammodytidae,</b> Cottidae and Myctophidae were abundant in early 1990 s, while Stichaeidae, <b>Ammodytidae</b> and Agonidae in recent decade. However, these small fish made up a small fraction (0. 02 %) of the total biomass of the pelagic community. To investigate the large scale spatial organization and biomass fluctuations of the pelagic compartment, monitoring data for the shorter period 1993 - 2013, including pelagic catches (krill, jellyfish, 0 -group fish and small fish) and acoustic measurements (pelagic fish stocks) were aggregated into small grid cells and larger geographic areas. The estimated total biomass of the investigated pelagic compartment, not including mesozooplankton, ranged between about 6 and 30 million tonnes wet weight with an average of 17 million tonnes over the period 1993 - 2013. Krill was the dominant biomass component (63 %), while pelagic fish (capelin, polar cod and herring) made up 26 % and 0 -group fish 11 % of the biomass on average. During 1993 - 2013, the total biomass of the pelagic compartment remained relatively stable within each of two main periods (before and after 2004), but increased by a factor of two from around 11 million tonnes in the first to around 23 million tonnes in the last period (i. e., after 2004). The pronounced increase likely reflected the warming and was driven mainly by an increase in krill, presumably due to increased advection. Variable recruitment of fish had a strong influence on the variation in pelagic biomass, first as 0 -group fish (including demersal species such as cod and haddock) and subsequently over the following years manifested as strong or weak year classes of the dominant pelagic species. The biomass distribution showed a broad-scale pattern reflecting differences in distribution of the main pelagic fishes (capelin in the north, polar cod in the east, and herring in the south) and transport of krill and 0 -group fish with the Atlantic water flowing into the southern Barents Sea. The highest average biomass values were found in the Southwestern and South-Central subareas (about 4 million tonnes in each), with krill as the main component. Biomass was also high in the North- Central subarea (about 3 million tonnes) where capelin was the major contributor. In conclusion, it is evident that the pelagic compartment has undergone large changes in the two last decades in going from a colder to a warmer temperature regime and from a low to a high productive pelagic compartment. The results presented support the general expectations under a climate change; increased production in the northern marine systems, and contraction and decline of arctic species while boreal species expand their distributions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Offshore {{renewable}} energy development (ORED) could induce local ecological changes, negatively affecting species of conservation interest. If well planned and coordinated, {{on the other}} hand, ORED could be beneficial to the marine environment {{in the region of}} device deployment in several respects. Because of the current scale and pace of offshore {{renewable energy}} development, interest is growing in the opportunities offered by the changes in fishing patterns that could result. Trawling, one of the most severe threats to the marine environment, particularly to fish and benthic invertebrate assemblages, will be prohibited or limited inside wind and wave farms. Areas of several square kilometres may therefore, in some important respects, resemble Marine Protected Areas; for areas that were previously trawled this exclusion could lead to average increases in biomass of motile organisms. Primary data from wind and wave farms are still scarce, but results to date from surveys targeting fish assemblages within offshore wind farms in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden basically indicate either increased abundance of some fish species (e. g., sand eels (<b>Ammodytidae),</b> cod (Gadus morhua), whiting (Merlangius merlangus), sole (Solea solea)) or no effect compared to conditions before construction of the wind farm. Effects are likely to be most prominent for species that had been heavily exploited in the area prior to the wind or wave farm establishment. It is believed that a relatively large area of exclusion is required to enhance biodiversity and generate spill-over effects. Construction and deployment of artificial reefs (AR) in coastal waters is practiced worldwide to manage fisheries, mitigate damage to the environment, protect (i. e., from trawling) and facilitate the rehabilitation of certain habitats (e. g., spawning sites) or water bodies, or to increase the recreational value of an area (e. g., by providing opportunities for recreational diving and fishing). Unless animals are deterred by potential disturbances, such as noise, maintenance work, and electromagnetic fields from turbines, it is reasonable to expect offshore wind energy structures, and also foundations of some types of wave energy devices, to function as artificial reef modules and enhance local abundance of marine organisms, including commercially important fish and crustaceans. However, taxon- and age-specific responses of fishes to ARs vary greatly with AR design and position as well as by region and latitude. It can therefore be difficult to predict the structure of fish and crustacean assemblages associated with the submerged parts of wind and wave energy devices, as well as the radius of influence. Nevertheless, relatively recent studies targeting the potential for wind turbines and wave energy foundations to aggregate fish and motile invertebrates in Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark suggest that densities of a number of fish and decapod species increase with proximity to these structures. Another category of artificial habitat is a Fish Aggregation Device (FAD), a floating structure deliberately placed on the surface or suspended in the water column to attract fish and enhance fishing efficiency. FADs are widely used in Asia and the western Indian Ocean. It has been suggested that floating offshore energy devices may function as FADs for pelagic fish, which could provide additional opportunities for fisheries management. Both ARs and FADs can have negative environmental and social effects if not properly planned and/or used. If ARs only aggregate fish from surrounding areas and do not contribute to added production, enhanced fishing efficiency in the AR area may aggravate overfishing if the new circumstances are not managed with caution. Similarly, increasing catchability, the main purpose of an FAD, may exacerbate the problem of overfishing on commercial species that are already at risk. ARs can also give rise to conflicts over user rights among fisher groups, and between recreational divers and fishers. Further, densities of benthic prey items have been shown to decrease with proximity to ARs due to predation by fish residing on the structures. FADs have been suggested as potential “ecological traps,” meaning that their presence could lure fish into remaining near the structures under non-optimal local feeding conditions, affecting physical condition and growth. Artificial structures may also provide habitats suitable for establishment of non-indigenous species; deployment of clusters of artificial structures may facilitate the establishment of new taxa in the recipient region by providing “beach heads” and stepping-stones. Non-indigenous sessile invertebrates have already been recorded at wind farms in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. A range of design and location factors may influence the fish community structure on artificial reefs, such as height, size, inclination, protuberance, surface structure, void space and number of interior hollows, shade effects, distance between modules, isolation, and composition of the surrounding seabed. Research is underway to evaluate species-specific habitat preferences in the design of offshore energy foundations to optimize biomass of desired species, or alternatively, minimize artificial reef effects where desired. For example, in an experiment with wave energy foundations on the west coast of Sweden the potential for enhancing the abundance of associated fish and crustaceans through low-cost manipulations of the structural complexity of foundations was examined. Additional experiments will provide further guidance on the influence of different designs of foundations on commercially important fish and shellfish. This presentation will focus on the potential influence of offshore wind and wave farms on fish and commercially important crustaceans. The uncertainties with regard to positive and negative effects of on benthic and pelagic assemblages and specific species will also be discussed. The presentation will draw on results from a number of field studies and experiments conducted in offshore wind and wave farms, as well as on secondary literature on the influence of differently designed artificial habitats on benthic fauna...|$|E
