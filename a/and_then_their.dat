5|$|Women were {{expected}} to obey the will of their father, then their husband, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>their</b> adult son in old age. However, it is known from contemporary sources {{that there were many}} deviations to this rule, especially in regard to mothers over their sons, and empresses who ordered around and openly humiliated their fathers and brothers. Women were exempt from the annual corvée labor duties, but often engaged in a range of income-earning occupations aside from their domestic chores of cooking and cleaning.|$|E
5|$|That night, as Sunnydale sleeps, white wisps float {{from each}} person's mouth to a belfry, where they {{settle in the}} box from Buffy's dream as ghoulish {{skeletal}} figures, with metal-toothed grins and impeccable black suits, look on. In the morning, Buffy and Willow discover {{they are unable to}} speak and become visibly distressed; they soon discover that everybody is unable to speak. The group gathers at Giles' where they see that the news is reporting that Sunnydale is suffering from an epidemic of laryngitis. Buffy and Riley, each concerned that chaos will ensue, find each other attempting to keep order on the streets. For the first time, Buffy sees Riley in his paramilitary role as an agent of The Initiative; he in turn is unaware that she is the Slayer. They exchange a look <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>their</b> first kiss, before parting to continue their efforts.|$|E

Many peasants were expecting this to happen and stopped taking care of themselves long ago. One woman, for instance, is alive only to the pain she feels when stray dogs chew on her feet. Others rip their plants {{out of the ground}} by the roots, refusing to let their property be taken into collectivization. The rest of the peasants spend the night involuntarily vomiting.|$|E
25|$|Poor ratings {{resulted}} in there being no 2004 season but in July 2005 The Mole returned to Australian TV for its fifth season, subtitled as The Amazing Game. Tom Williams (Co-host of The Great Outdoors and {{winner of the}} Australian edition of Dancing with the Stars) was chosen to take over as host from Bowler, as he was not available for the project due to family commitments.

25|$|The Atlantic {{slave trade}} or transatlantic slave trade {{involved}} the transportation by slave traders of enslaved African people, mainly from Africa to the Americas, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>their</b> sale there. The slave trade used mainly the triangular trade route and its Middle Passage, and existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The {{vast majority of}} those who were enslaved and transported in the transatlantic slave trade were Africans from central and western Africa, who had been sold by other West Africans to Western European slave traders (with a small number being captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids), who brought them to the Americas. The South Atlantic and Caribbean economies especially were dependent on the supply of secure labour for the production of commodity crops, making goods and clothing to sell in Europe. This was crucial to those western European countries which, in the late 17th and 18th centuries, were vying with each other to create overseas empires.|$|E

500|$|Major Blair Inskip Swannell (20 August 1875 – 25 April 1915) was an English-born {{international}} rugby union forward {{who played}} club rugby for Northampton, and internationally for the British Isles and later Australia.

He played a total of seven Test matches on these tours, and scored one Test try – against Australia during the 1904 tour. After settling in Australia, Swannell played a single game for his new home when they faced New Zealand. He {{was viewed as a}} violent player, and this made his unpopular with other players. Former Australian captain Herbert Moran said of him that [...] "... his conception of rugby was one of trained violence".|$|E
500|$|Some Chinese died on {{the banks}} of Bitter Creek as they fled, others near the {{railroad}} bridge as they attempted to escape Chinatown. The rioters threw Chinese bodies into the flames of burning buildings. Other Chinese immigrants, who had hidden in their houses instead of fleeing, were murdered, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>their</b> bodies were burned with their houses. Those who could not run, including the sick, were burned alive in their camp houses. Many of the Chinese who were burned in their houses apparently tried [...] "to dig a hole in the cellar to hide themselves. But the fire overtook them when about half way in the hole, burning their lower limbs to a crisp and leaving the upper trunk untouched." [...] One remaining Chinese immigrant was found dead in a laundry house in Whitemen's Town, his home demolished by rioters.|$|E

500|$|At 13:05 on 14 September, Kawaguchi led the {{survivors}} of his shattered brigade away from the ridge {{and deeper into the}} jungle, where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day. Kawaguchi's units were then ordered to withdraw west to the Matanikau River valley to join with Oka's unit, a [...] march over difficult terrain. Kawaguchi's troops began the march on the morning of 16 September. Almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded. As the march progressed, the exhausted and hungry soldiers, who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal, began to discard their heavy equipment <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>their</b> rifles. By the time most of them reached Oka's positions at Kokumbona five days later, only half still carried their weapons. The Kuma battalion's survivors, attempting to follow Kawaguchi's Center Body forces, became lost, wandered for three weeks in the jungle, and almost starved to death before finally reaching Kawaguchi's camp.|$|E

500|$|The game {{restarted}} {{with two}} new goaltenders and the Senators {{on the power}} play, but within three seconds, the fighting started again — Ottawa's Chris Neil poked Radovan Somik with his stick, and the pair started scrapping. At the same time, Zdeno Chara started a fight with the Flyers' Mattias Timander, for which the former received an instigator penalty. Both fights angered Philadelphia Head Coach Ken Hitchcock, who claimed that, [...] "Their tough guy [...] got beat up <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>their</b> next two lines fought guys who don't fight." [...] Flyer General Manager Bob Clarke was also critical, saying, [...] "I understand Rob Ray fighting Donald Brashear. That's okay. [...] But don't go after guys who don't know how to defend themselves like Somik and Timander." [...] As Chara had been ejected from the game, his penalty was served by Martin Havlat, who had been placed there {{to protect him from}} any possible attempts at retribution. Chara's penalty meant that at the next restart, the teams were back to even strength, with four players each. Immediately after the ensuing face-off, Michal Handzus and Mike Fisher took part in the seventh fight of the game.|$|E
