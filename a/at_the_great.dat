Hornswoggle also entered the match at the bell, but {{immediately}} escaped the ring and hid under it. With all of the cruiserweights down, {{with the exception of}} Noble, Hornswoggle came out from under the ring and delivered a Tadpole Splash to Noble. He pinned him afterwards to win the match and the Cruiserweight Championship. Candice Michelle and Melina continued to feud over the WWE Women's Championship. The two had a rematch <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> American Bash for the title. Michelle pinned Melina after delivering a Candy Wrapper to retain the title.|$|E

5|$|On the June 30 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, a match between six wrestlers {{for a new}} top-tier SmackDown! {{championship}} was held. JBL, one of the participants, was victorious in the match, but Theodore Long {{announced that he was}} still not the champion. Instead he had won the right to a match against the World Heavyweight champion, Batista, who was SmackDown!'s final 2005 draft pick, making the World Heavyweight Championship exclusive to SmackDown!. The following week, it was announced Batista would meet JBL <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> American Bash with the World Heavyweight championship on the line. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> American Bash, Batista was disqualified for attacking JBL with a chair and JBL was declared the winner. In WWE, a title cannot be won by disqualification, but only by pinfall or submission (the normal scoring conditions in professional wrestling matches). As a result, Batista retained the title.|$|E

5|$|A new {{main drain}} to Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, {{using one of the}} first applications of John Appold's centrifugal pump, following its appearance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Exhibition in 1851. Traffic on the network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell dramatically in the early twentieth century. The last regular commercial traffic was the tanker barge Shellfen, which delivered fuel oil to pumping stations until 1971.|$|E

The sand rampart {{that lined the}} entire Suez Canal {{did not exist in}} the Bitter Lakes, and there were no Israeli defences or units to be encountered, and the brigade reached the opposite bank around 14:40 without any losses. The Egyptians discovered a minefield blocking their advance, and military engineers worked to clear a path.|$|E
5|$|Bekele was keen {{to regain}} his cross country title from Zersenay and the 2008 cross country season was a {{competitive}} one. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Edinburgh International Cross Country race, Zersenay was pipped by the Ethiopian at the line, finishing just one second behind. The following month, Zersenay beat Eliud Kipchoge to win the Cinque Mulini race in the buildup to the 2008 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. On {{the day of the}} Championship race in Edinburgh, Scotland, Zersenay took the lead early on and set a strong pace at the mid-race point. However, near the finish Bekele and Kenyan Leonard Komon surged ahead to leave Zersenay as the bronze medallist.|$|E

5|$|Celebrities, artists, {{and merchants}} enjoyed fine food, opium, and liquor <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Southern Hotel, which had novel Western pleasures, {{such as a}} disco ball {{specially}} imported from the USA. The allure of Western goods and traditions even extended to weddings held at the hotel. A prolific Chinese writer, Wu Sijing, held her 17-table wedding banquet there in 1952, and was photographed in a white bridal dress, {{with her husband in}} a white suit and bowtie. This choice of dress would have been most unusual amongst mainland Chinese due to the nationalistic influence of Mao-era China, highlighting Singapore's confluence between Eastern and Western cultures, of which the hotel was at the forefront. Both in decor, and activities.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War Britain {{suffered}} severe {{shortages of}} raw materials. While consideration {{was given to}} reopening the closed mines, this was not deemed viable and instead the few remaining mines increased their production. As many male workers were away on military service, some women were briefly employed in tin-picking at Geevor, and in ore-dressing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Rock iron mine on Dartmoor, {{during and after the}} war until around 1952. Other than a very limited number of female workers after the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 ended the policy of recruiting only men for underground work in the few surviving mines, the Geevor pickers were the last female manual labourers in the Cornish mining industry.|$|E

Equipped with a glowing letter of endorsement from Emperor Francis II to the Russian Infantry General Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov (1745–1813), Schmitt {{arrived at the}} Russian headquarters and was appointed Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Allied Army. Schmitt met with the Russian forces <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> abbey by Melk, on the Danube, and he and the commanders concocted a plan to encircle Édouard Mortier's French force near Dürenstein. To do so, they drew not only on their own military experience, but called upon a captain from the region, to use his geographic and local knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Following WrestleMania XX, Sable {{quickly turned}} heel again {{and engaged in}} another short feud with Torrie Wilson.

On the edition of July 1 of SmackDown, Sable was defeated by Wilson in a rematch. Sable's final appearance in WWE was on SmackDown! when she, Dawn Marie, and Wilson accompanied Eddie Guerrero to the ring in his lowrider.
