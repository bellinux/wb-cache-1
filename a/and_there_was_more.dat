5|$|Securing an {{airstrip}} {{would be}} an important objective for the invader. Airfields, considered extremely vulnerable, were protected by trench works and pillboxes which faced inwards towards the runway, rather than outwards. Many of these fortifications were specified by the Air Ministry and defensive designs were unique to airfields—these would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so the degree of protection was less <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> emphasis on all-round visibility and sweeping fields of fire. It was difficult to defend large open areas without creating impediments to the movement of friendly aircraft. Solutions to this problem included the pop-up Picket Hamilton fort—a light pillbox that could be lowered to ground level when the airfield was in use.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Fredericksburg {{recovered}} {{its former}} {{position as a}} center of local trade and slowly grew beyond its prewar boundaries. Neither the city of Fredericksburg, nor either of the surrounding counties, reached the 1860 level of population again {{until well into the}} 20th century. After the war, many freedmen moved to Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia, where there had been established free black communities before the war, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> work.|$|E
25|$|Stays {{evolved in}} the 18th century when {{whalebone}} was used more, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> boning used in the garment. The shape of the stays changed as well. While the stays were low and wide in the front, they could reach {{as high as the}} upper shoulder in the back. Stays could be strapless or use shoulder straps. The straps of the stays were generally attached in the back and tied at the front sides.|$|E

25|$|There {{were also}} designs for pillbox-like {{structures}} for various purposes including light anti-aircraft positions, observation posts and searchlight positions {{to illuminate the}} shoreline. In addition, the Air Ministry provided designs of fortifications intended to protect airfields from troops landing or parachuting. These would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so that the degree of protection was less <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> emphasis on all-round visibility and sweeping fields of fire. Many of these were later reinforced.|$|E
25|$|After retirement, Parks {{wrote her}} {{autobiography}} {{and continued to}} insist that the struggle for justice was not over <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> work to be done. In her final years, she suffered from dementia. Parks received national recognition, including the NAACP's 1979 Spingarn Medal, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and a posthumous statue in the United States Capitol's National Statuary Hall. Upon her death in 2005, she was the first woman and third non-US government official to lie in honor at the Capitol Rotunda. Her birthday, February 4, and the day she was arrested, December 1, have both become Rosa Parks Day, commemorated in California and Missouri (February 4), and Ohio and Oregon (December 1).|$|E
25|$|Ridership {{continued}} to grow, especially after World War I started, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> money around. In 1915, five additional Class 2 trams were bought. In 1919, {{the company had}} 13.9 million passengers. In 1918, eight used horse-cars were bought from Oslo Sporveier and rebuilt to electric trailers and to metre gauge. Ten new trams of Class 3 were delivered in 1922. To create enough overnight space for all the new trams, a third depot was built at Dalsenget, and the Elgeseter Line extended there in 1923. New turning loops were also built at Ilevolden and Voldsminde in 1921. The passing loops at the railway station was built in 1928, and at Dalsenget in 1949. Bakke Bridge was rebuilt in 1928 so {{the last part of}} the Lademoen Line had double track.|$|E

500|$|Overmars {{made his}} {{competitive}} debut for Arsenal against Leeds United in a 1–1 draw on 9 August 1997. Two weeks later, he scored his first {{goal for the}} club, away to Southampton. Arsenal went {{to the top of}} the league table on goal difference in September 1997, after a 4–0 win against West Ham United. Overmars, who scored two goals in the match, had now [...] "run into devastating form" [...] according to Brian Glanville. His impact however waned in the subsequent months and so did Arsenal's form; a 3–1 defeat to Blackburn Rovers on 13 December 1997 meant the club dropped to fifth place. The turn of the year saw improvement to Overmars' game, which coincided with [...] "the more general rejuvenation of the whole team". He scored both of Arsenal's goals in their win over Leeds United on 11 January 1998. Overmars up until this point was subject to criticism from commentators and fans. Wenger emphasised that this was his first year in England <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> to come from him. He said Overmars was a [...] "positive buy" [...] and pointed out that his goalscoring record was [...] "not bad for a winger".|$|E

[...] West Indies amassed 681 at Port of Spain, with the three Ws rampant, but England secured a draw and won at Kingston thanks to Hutton's epic 205 and Bailey's 7 for 34.|$|E
2500|$|Bonser named {{eleven of}} the canyons and rapids on the Skeena River, using the {{character}} of the obstacle as a guide. Among them were the Whirly Gig Rapids, Hornet’s Nest Rapids and the Devil’s Elbow Canyon, where the Skeena rushed directly towards a rock bluff before twisting off to the right. Despite these perils the Caledonia operated for seven seasons until the HBC replaced her with a new sternwheeler in 1898, also named the Caledonia. By this time, the Klondike Gold Rush was in full swing <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> interest in the north than ever previously. Robert Cunningham had prospered during this period and now owned a cannery and a lumber mill. He decided that a sternwheeler would be a fine addition to his enterprises, and he bought the Monte Cristo and hired Captain Bonser away from the HBC to pilot it. The HBC built a second sternwheeler, the Strathcona, and were little concerned about Cunningham’s rival vessel.|$|E

[...] Though the method of using certified mail was in itself reasonably calculated to give notice, the knowledge that the State gained when the mail was returned unclaimed obligated it to take additional reasonable steps. However, [...] "n response to the returned form suggesting that Jones had not received notice {{that he was about to}} lose his property, the State didnothing." [...] The Court believed that [...] "someone who actually wanted to alert Jones that he was in danger of losing his house would do more when the attempted notice letter was returned unclaimed, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> that reasonably could be done." ...|$|E
