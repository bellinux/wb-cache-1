40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of vascular dementia (VaD) remains a controversial issue in many aspects and concepts. These nosologic problems are caused {{both by the}} methods, insufficient to ascertain the diagnosis, {{as well as by}} the weak consistency of the clinical concept of VaD itself. One of the most intriguing issues on VaD, and in particular on post-stroke dementia (PSD), is related to the time of development of cognitive decline. In clinical practice, the 3 -month time threshold is usually chosen to enable resolution of a possible <b>acute</b> post-stroke <b>delirium,</b> and to obtain a more reliable cognitive assessment with a complete regression of acute neuropsychological stroke-related deficits. Another relevant issue is the possibility to predict which patient will develop PSD. In this regard, recent data indicate an overlap between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and PSD, which seems to share risk factors and neuropathology. In most population samples these two disorders appear together, and the consensus is growing that a degenerative component has a more important role in determining PSD onset shortly after stroke than previously recognized. Therefore, anamnestic data have a fundamental role in this prognostic approach. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: Studies {{have shown}} showed that {{delirium}} affects the long-term functional status, however, the <b>acute</b> effect of <b>delirium</b> on functioning {{has been less}} documented. The purpose of this analysis {{was to examine the}} <b>acute</b> impact of <b>delirium</b> on the level of functioning. Methods: All patients were recruited at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). The Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) and Karnofsky scale of Performance Status (KPS) were recorded at baseline (T 1), 2 - 3 days (T 2) and 4 - 7 days (T 3). A secondary analysis in respect to sociodemographic and medical variables, aspects of delirium, and level of functioning was performed. Results: Delirium severity at baseline did not affect the level of functioning, however, resolved delirium resulted in substantial functional recovery compared to persistent delirium at T 2 (30. 2 and 23. 5) and T 3 (35. 1 and 26. 2). Patients with persistent functional impairment were not different in age, pre-existing dementia or brain metastasis compared to those with functional recovery. However, brain cancer, terminal illness, hypoxia and multiple etiologies caused persistent functional decline. Although delirium severity was not different at baseline, delirium was more severe in the functionally-impaired at T 2 and T 3. Similarly, delirium resolution was inferior in these patients in contrast to the functionally-recovered at T 2 (25 % and 65. 4 %) and T 3 (62. 5 % and 83. 3 %). On the contrary, the duration of delirium affected functional recovery; shorter delirium predicted faster functional recovery. Conclusions: <b>Delirium</b> caused an <b>acute</b> functional decline and appropriate management of delirium with antipsychotics reversed this decline. On the contrary, shorter duration of delirium was associated with faster functional recovery.
