5|$|After {{the others}} leave, Fitzgerald {{attempts}} to smother Glass but is discovered by Hawk. Fitzgerald stabs {{him to death}} as Glass watches helplessly. The next morning, Fitzgerald convinces Bridger that the Arikara <b>are</b> <b>approaching</b> and they must abandon Glass. After they depart, Fitzgerald admits he lied. When Fitzgerald and Bridger meet Henry at the fort, Fitzgerald tells him that Glass died and Hawk vanished.|$|E
5|$|After Negron {{gets his}} damaged {{backpack}} radio working, the soldiers contact headquarters and {{are told to}} capture an enemy soldier. A local Partisan group arrives with a young German deserter, Hans Brundt, as their prisoner. Earlier, residents of the nearby village of Sant'Anna di Stazzema were killed by German forces following a betrayal by a partisan, named Rodolfo, who knows that Brundt can identify him as the traitor. After concealing the fact that German forces <b>are</b> <b>approaching</b> the village in a counterattack, Rodolfo kills Brundt and the Partisan leader before escaping. It is Rodolfo whom Negron will kill 39 years later. Captain Nokes arrives in the village to interrogate Brundt and finds him dead. The Americans prepare to leave the village ahead of a German counterattack, but Sam refuses to leave Angelo behind. After promising to court-martial all four soldiers, Nokes and his contingent drive out of town, but he is killed in the opening German offensive.|$|E
5|$|Minka, Didi, and Stu {{arrive in}} the attic to find the group enthralled {{by the end of}} Boris' story: Moses, cornered, calls down the power of God to part the Red Sea, which the Hebrews <b>are</b> <b>approaching.</b> They pass through the parted waters, which then crash back {{together}} behind them, engulfing the Pharaoh and her army. With the story over, the family gets up to finish the Seder only to see the wind blow the door shut, locking them all in. Boris decides to tell them another story, which Chas at first thinks is about how the Hebrews wandered the desert for forty years before finally reaching the Promised Land. Boris explains that it's actually a story about how an aunt and uncle of his met at Passover Seder back in Russia.|$|E

5|$|While the Hornet Upgrade Program {{has been}} successful, the RAAF's Hornets <b>are</b> <b>approaching</b> retirement. It is {{expected}} that the aircraft will be increasingly expensive to operate as they age, and improvements to the fighter aircraft and air defences operated by other countries will reduce the Hornets' combat effectiveness. The Australian Government is currently planning to replace the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornets with Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II fighters from 2018 onwards. The Defence Materiel Organisation's Project AIR 6000 Phase 2A/B specifies that 72 F-35A fighters will be acquired to equip three squadrons and an operational training unit. No. 3 Squadron {{will be the first}} Hornet unit to be reequipped, commencing in 2018, and all of the F/A-18A and Bs are scheduled to be retired by 2023. The RAAF's Hornet sustainability planning has been designed to allow the type to be retained in service for longer if the F-35 program experiences further delays, however.|$|E

25|$|With {{respect to}} the display, placing and {{precedence}} of the national flag by both itself and {{in relation to other}} flags, the Department has made a number of suggestions. No flag or pennant should be flown above the national flag. When the flag is carried with another flag, or flags, it should be carried in the place of honour— that is on the marching right, or on the left of an observer towards whom the flags <b>are</b> <b>approaching.</b> Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be carried on the immediate left of the national flag, or, as seen by an observer when the flags <b>are</b> <b>approaching,</b> on the immediate right of the national flag. In the event of a display of crossed staffs, the national flag should be to the right and to the fore— that is {{to the left of the}} observer who is facing the flag. Its staff should be in front of the other flag or flags.|$|E

25|$|There remain {{some aspects}} of flash-based SSDs that make them unattractive. The cost per {{gigabyte}} of flash memory remains significantly {{higher than that of}} hard disks. Also flash memory has a finite number of P/Ecycles, but this seems to be currently under control since warranties on flash-based SSDs <b>are</b> <b>approaching</b> those of current hard drives. In addition, deleted files on SSDs can remain for an indefinite period of time before being overwritten by fresh data; erasure or shred techniques or software that work well on magnetic hard disk drives have no effect on SSDs, compromising security and forensic examination.|$|E

In these situations, however, the spider with its forelegs raised and waving backs off while facing the moving object and, when 5–8cm away, turns away and flees.|$|E
25|$|Robertson {{was clear}} {{that it would take}} more than one battle (28 December 1915, 1 January 1916) to defeat Germany, but like many British generals he {{overestimated}} the chances of success on the Somme, noting that Britain had more ammunition and big guns than before, that by attacking on a wide front of 20 miles or so, the attackers would not be subjected to enfilade German artillery fire (in the event this probably spread the artillery too thin, contributing to the disaster of 1 July) and that attrition would work in the Allies’ favour as “the Germans <b>are</b> <b>approaching</b> the limit of their resources”.|$|E

Friars, pilgrims and other common people <b>are</b> <b>approaching</b> the corpse to pay homage; on the sides are two richly dressed characters, identified as Riccomanno Bufalini (on the left, with a fur-lined hood and the gloves) and a member of his family. The remaining characters are used to portray a series of miracles attributed to Bernardino during his life: the healing of a blind man(who hints at his eyes), the resurrection of someone possessed, the healing of a dead newborn, the healing of Lorenzo di Niccolò da Prato, wounded by a bull, and the pacification of the Umbrian families.|$|E
25|$|The {{dual role}} of biomass as a {{substitute}} for fossil fuels and as a sink for atmospheric carbon is the main advantage for its use in energy generation. Bioenergy production from sustainable biomass sources is considered to be carbon neutral because CO2 emitted during combustion or natural degradation processes is captured by growing plants. Although biomass-based Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) with carbon capture storage (CCS) may be promising technologies for reducing GHG emissions from electricity generating plants, these technologies are small-scale and not well developed in Ontario. The movement in favour of generating bioenergy from municipal waste appears to be a strategy to mitigate trash management; many municipal landfills <b>are</b> <b>approaching</b> capacity. There is a potential to generate income from methane emissions from municipal waste.|$|E
25|$|Proposals {{that may}} lead to a quantum theory of gravity such as string theory and loop quantum gravity predict {{violations}} of the weak equivalence principle because they contain many light scalar fields with long Compton wavelengths, which should generate fifth forces and variation of the fundamental constants. Heuristic arguments suggest that the magnitude of these equivalence principle violations could be in the 10−13 to 10−18 range. Currently envisioned tests of the weak equivalence principle <b>are</b> <b>approaching</b> a degree of sensitivity such that non-discovery of a violation would be just as profound a result as discovery of a violation. Non-discovery of equivalence principle violation in this range would suggest that gravity is so fundamentally different from other forces as to require a major reevaluation of current attempts to unify gravity with the other forces of nature. A positive detection, on the other hand, would provide a major guidepost towards unification.|$|E
