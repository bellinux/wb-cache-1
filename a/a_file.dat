5|$|TRIM is a SATA {{command that}} enables the {{operating}} system to tell an SSD which blocks of previously saved data are no longer needed {{as a result of}} file deletions or volume formatting. When an LBA is replaced by the OS, as with an overwrite of <b>a</b> <b>file,</b> the SSD knows that the original LBA can be marked as stale or invalid and it will not save those blocks during garbage collection. If the user or operating system erases <b>a</b> <b>file</b> (not just remove parts of it), the file will typically be marked for deletion, but the actual contents on the disk are never actually erased. Because of this, the SSD does not know that it can erase the LBAs previously occupied by the file, so the SSD will keep including such LBAs in the garbage collection.|$|E

5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used by recent {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when <b>a</b> <b>file</b> is copied {{from the hard}} disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect {{should be kept in}} mind when trying to determine if <b>a</b> <b>file</b> is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a checksum algorithm).|$|E
5|$|The with {{statement}} (from Python 2.5), which encloses a {{code block}} within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening <b>a</b> <b>file</b> and then closing it), allowing Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)-like behavior.|$|E
5|$|A path, which {{contains}} data, usually organized in hierarchical form, that {{appears as a}} sequence of segments separated by slashes. Such a sequence may resemble or map exactly to <b>a</b> <b>file</b> system path, but does not always imply a relation to one. The path must begin with a single slash (/) if an authority part was present, and may also if one was not, but must not begin with a double slash. The path is always defined, though the defined path may be empty (zero length), therefore no trailing slash.|$|E
50|$|To obtain <b>a</b> <b>filing</b> date, the {{documents}} filed {{must comply with}} the regulations of the patent office {{in which it was}} <b>filed.</b> <b>A</b> full specification complying with all rules may not be required to obtain <b>a</b> <b>filing</b> date. For example, in the U.K., claims and an abstract are not required to obtain <b>a</b> <b>filing</b> date, but can be added later. However, since no subject matter can be added to an application after the filing date, it is important that an application disclose all material relevant to the application at the time of filing. If the requirements for the award of <b>a</b> <b>filing</b> date are not met, the patent office notifies the applicant of the deficiencies. Depending upon the law of the patent office in question, correction may be possible without moving the filing date, or the application may be awarded <b>a</b> <b>filing</b> date adjusted to the date on which the requirements are completed.|$|R

Similarly to its desktop counterpart, it comes bundled with a set of applications that perform basic tasks. Internet Explorer Mobile is the default web browser, and Windows Media Player is the default media player used for playing digital media. The mobile version of Microsoft Office, is the default office suite.|$|E
5|$|PHP acts {{primarily}} as a filter, taking input from <b>a</b> <b>file</b> or stream containing text and/or PHP instructions and outputting another stream of data. Most commonly the output will be HTML, although it could be JSON, XML or binary data such as image or audio formats. Since PHP 4, the PHP parser compiles input to produce bytecode for processing by the Zend Engine, giving improved performance over its interpreter predecessor.|$|E

In 1950 Du Bois became chairman of the newly created Peace Information Center (PIC), which worked to publicize the Stockholm Peace Appeal in the United States. The primary purpose of the appeal was to gather signatures on a petition, asking governments around the world to ban all nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{operating}} systems, Plan 9 {{does not provide}} special application programming interfaces (such as Berkeley sockets, X resources or ioctl system calls) to access devices.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1951–52 season, Barnes returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to regain his Test position, and performed well. He was chosen by the selectors but the board disallowed his selection for conduct reasons rather than ability. The media figured this out and publicised it, and Barnes was overlooked for the whole season. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, <b>a</b> <b>file</b> of unknown authorship was found; it accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by making gestures implying they were blind.|$|E

50|$|TIFF is <b>a</b> flexible, {{adaptable}} <b>file</b> {{format for}} handling images and data within <b>a</b> single <b>file,</b> by {{including the header}} tags (size, definition, image-data arrangement, applied image compression) defining the image's geometry. <b>A</b> TIFF <b>file,</b> for example, can be a container holding JPEG (lossy) and PackBits (lossless) compressed images. <b>A</b> TIFF <b>file</b> also can include a vector-based clipping path (outlines, croppings, image frames). The ability to store image data in a lossless format makes <b>a</b> TIFF <b>file</b> <b>a</b> useful image archive, because, unlike standard JPEG <b>files,</b> <b>a</b> TIFF <b>file</b> using lossless compression (or none) may be edited and re-saved without losing image quality.

She learns that all bogyphobia patients - including Tim Jensen, the protagonist of the first film - have committed suicide after being treated by Dr. Mitchell Allen. Darren and Nicky have sex in the locker room as Laura finds Alison; she alerts them to Alison's corpse, but they find upon returning that the blood and maggots have been cleaned up, leading them to believe that Laura is hallucinating. Darren and Nicky go to his room, where they argue about the viability of their relationship. Darren forces Nicky out of his room, and is then attacked by the Boogeyman, who disembowels him and removes his heart.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the team}} was not {{announced}} at the scheduled time due to the delay caused by the veto.

In later years, <b>a</b> <b>file</b> of unknown authorship regarding Barnes's behaviour was deposited in the NSWCA library.
