25|$|The {{arrival of}} the Africanized honey bee in Central America is {{threatening}} the ancient art of keeping Melipona stingless bees in log gums {{even though they do}} not interbreed or directly compete with each other. The honey production from a single hive of Africanized bees can be 100kg annually and far exceeds the much smaller 3–5kg of the various Melipona stingless species. Thus economic pressures <b>are</b> <b>forcing</b> beekeepers to switch from the traditional bees of their ancestors to the new reality of the Africanized honey bee. Whether this will lead to their extinction is unknown, but they are well adapted to exist in the wild, {{and there are a number}} of indigenous plants that the Africanized honey bees do not visit, so their fate remains to be seen.|$|E

She reported that she was denied visitors, her telephones were repeatedly down, and complained that even her elderly mother {{had not been able}} to get through to her. Visitors were denied entrance to her residential compound, including Norwegian diplomats who had tried to visit her on 12 October; she was able to send out a few messages through Twitter. Chinese police stationed there cordoned off the area. Thus, journalists and well-wishers were kept at bay for several hours after the announcement; as she was being taken away to see her husband, Reuters heard her say [...] "they <b>are</b> <b>forcing</b> me to leave Beijing". Dissident groups reported on 18 October that numerous supporters and associates of Liu may have been detained by police—that Tiananmen Mother Ding Zilin, and her husband Jiang Peikun, had not been seen or heard of for four days, and that their phones were cut off. Writer Jiang Qisheng went missing just days after the Nobel announcement.|$|E

After Drake succeeds, Sullivan arrives in a boat full of several boxes of treasure, and picks up Drake and Elena.
