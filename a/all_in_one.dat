5|$|Several {{types of}} {{volcanic}} eruptions—during which lava, tephra (ash, lapilli, volcanic bombs and volcanic blocks), and assorted gases are expelled from a volcanic vent or fissure—have been distinguished by volcanologists. These are often named after famous volcanoes where {{that type of}} behavior has been observed. Some volcanoes may exhibit only one characteristic type of eruption {{during a period of}} activity, while others may display an entire sequence of types <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> eruptive series.|$|E

In 1998, the Supercopa Libertadores was discontinued and the Recopa went into a hiatus. The {{competition has}} been disputed with either a presently-used two-legged series or a single match-up at a neutral venue. Together with the aforementioned tournaments, a club has the {{chance to win the}} CONMEBOL Treble <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> year or season.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius characterizes Urbanus {{as a man}} {{who enjoyed}} some variety in his punishments. One day, shortly after Easter 307, he ordered the virgin Theodosia from Tyre (Ṣūr, Lebanon) thrown to the sea for conversing with Christians {{attending}} trial and refusing sacrifice; the Christians in court, meanwhile, he sent to Phaeno. On a single day, November 2, 307, Urbanus sentenced a man named Domninus to be burned alive, three youths to fight as gladiators, and a priest to be exposed to a beast. On the same day, he ordered some young men to be castrated, sent three virgins to brothels, and imprisoned a number of others, including Pamphilus of Caesarea, a priest, scholar, and defender of the theologian Origen. Soon after, and for unknown reasons, Urbanus was stripped of his rank, imprisoned, tried, and executed, <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> day of expedited proceedings. His replacement, Firmilianus, was a veteran soldier and one of Maximinus's trusted confidants.|$|E

5|$|Exipulum is a {{term used}} to refer to the tissue or tissues {{containing}} the hymenium of an ascomycete fruit body. The ectal excipulum (outer tissue layer) is thin (20–30µm thickness), made of a tissue type known as texura porrecta, consisting of more or less parallel hyphae <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> direction, with wide lumina and non-thickened walls. The medullary exipulum (middle tissue layer) is thick (200–600µm) and made of textura intricata, a tissue layer made of irregularly interwoven hyphae with distinct spaces between the hyphae. The asci (filamentous structures in which the ascospores develop) are cylindrical with gradually tapering bases, eight-spored, and measure 240–280 by 12–15µm. The ascospores have ellipsoidal to roughly cylindrical shapes, usually with blunt ends, and measure 19–22 by 10–12µm. They have smooth surfaces and usually contain two large oil drops. The paraphyses (sterile, filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are cylindrical, 2–3µm thick, barely enlarged at their apices, straight, and mostly unbranched above. They may sometimes anastomose, but do not form a conspicuous network. The paraphyses contain numerous red granules.|$|E

25|$|A {{postage meter}} is a {{mechanical}} device {{used to create}} and apply physical evidence of postage, or franking, to mailed matter. Postage meters are regulated by a country's postal authority; for example, in the United States, the United States Postal Service specifies the rules for the creation, support, and use of postage meters. A postage meter imprints an amount of postage, functioning as a postage stamp, a cancellation and a dated postmark <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one.</b> The postage meter was invented by Chicago inventor Arthur Pitney, receiving a patent for the invention on October 14, 1902.|$|E

While the style and design of the building is unquestionably Gothic, it resembles no building constructed during the Middle Ages. The forms were the same, but their arrangement was uniquely modern. The Parliament Buildings also departed from Medieval models by integrating a variety of eras and styles of Gothic architecture, including elements of Gothic architecture from Britain, France, the Low Countries, and Italy <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> building.|$|E
