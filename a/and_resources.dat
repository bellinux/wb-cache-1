5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging from and defending. Frequently, territory sizes, normally , are correlated with the abundance of rain <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> in a region; smaller territories occur where insects <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> are plentiful. Additionally, the feeding territories are larger {{during the winter months}} when these birds spend much of their time foraging with the entire clan.

5|$|A {{combination}} of favorable geographical features {{contributed to the}} success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River.

Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E

40|$|Energy <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> {{companies}} have {{a crucial role}} in achieving future sustainable economies. We investigate the performance of international Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) energy <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> companies on the stock market over a 10 -year period (February 2005 -January 2015). We select portfolios of established energy <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> stocks with substantial environmental and social responsibility activities. Our findings demonstrate that the annual average performance of the energy <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> SRI portfolio was superior to returns of different benchmark indices. The energy <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> SRI stock investments were also more profitable on the risk-adjusted basis. Additionally, we applied Fama-French and Carhart four factor models and found that the returns of our portfolios are more consistently explained by the market factor than by other factors. We also show that oil price has a statistically significant influence on the returns of the SRI energy <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> stocks. However, the performance of the energy <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> SRI portfolio was no longer superior when dividends were excluded from the calculation of total returns. Indeed, the performance of portfolios without dividends was poor compared to the benchmark indices in most sub-periods, in the sub-samples of bullish and bearish markets and in the full sample. This finding demonstrates the importance of dividends in the investment performance of the energy <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> SRI stocks...|$|R
