She knew his arguments, as she had declared, and he had the intelligence to realize that a repetition of them, on his part, would be useless. She brought home to him, as never before, a sense of the anomalistic position of the Church in these modern days, of its appallingly lessened weight even with its own members. As a successor of the Apostles, he had no power over this woman, or very little; he could neither rebuke her, nor sentence her to penance. She recognized his <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> her daughter, to baptize her daughter's children, but not to interfere in any way with her spiritual life. It was as a personality he had moved her--a personality apparently not in harmony with his doctrine. Women had hinted at this before. And while Mrs. Constable had not, as she perceived, shaken his conviction, the very vividness and unexpectedness of a confession from her--had stirred him to the marrow, had opened doors, perforce, which he, himself had marked forbidden, and given him a glimpse beyond before he could lower his eyes. Was there, after all, something in him that responded in spite of himself? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This naked appearance, {{together}} with their miserable circumstances, was no very comfortable sight to my Spaniards, who, for their parts, I may venture, Sir, without flattery, to say, are men of the best behaviour, calmest tempers, and sweetest nature, that can possibly be; for they immediately ordered Friday's father {{to see if he}} knew any of them, or if he understood what they could say. No sooner did the old Indian appear, but he looked at them with great seriousness; yet, as they were not of his nation, they were utter strangers to him, and none could understand his speech or signs, but one woman. This was enough to answer the design, which was to assure them they would not be killed, being fallen into the hands of Christians, who abhorred such barbarity. When they were fully satisfied of this, they expressed their joy by such strange gestures, and uncommon tones, as it is not possible for me to describe. But the woman their interpreter, was ordered next to enquire, whether they were content to be servants, and would work for the men who had brought them hither to save their lives? Hereupon, (being at this time unbound) they fell a capering and dancing, one taking this thing upon her shoulders, and the other that, intimating, that they were willing to do any thing for them. But now, Sir, having women among us, and dreading that it might occasion some strife, if not blood, I asked the three men 'what they would do, and how they intended to use these creatures, whether as servants or women?' One of them very pertly and readily answered, 'they would use them as both,' Gentlemen, said I as you are your own masters, I am not going to restrain you from that; but methinks, for avoiding dissentions among you, I would only desire you to engage, that none of you will take more than one for a woman or wife, and that having taken this one, none else should presume to touch her; for though we have not yet a priestly <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> you, yet it is but reasonable, that whoever thus takes a woman, should be obliged to maintain her, since nobody has any thing to do with her; and this, indeed, appeared so just to all present, that it was unanimously agreed to. The Englishmen then asked my Spaniards, 'whether they designed to take any of them? but they all answered, No; some declaring they had already wives in Spain; and others that they cared not to join with infidels. On the reverse, the Englishmen took each of them a temporary wife, and so set up a new method of living. As to Friday's father, the Spaniards, and the three savage servants we had taken in the late battle, they all lived with me in our ancient castle; and indeed we supplied {{the main part of the}} island with food, as necessity required. But the most remarkable part of the story is, how these Englishmen, who had been so much at variance, should agree about the choice of those women; yet they took a way good enough to prevent quarreling among themselves. They let the five women in one of their huts, and going themselves to the other, drew lots which should have the first choice. Now, he that had the first lot went to the hut, and fetched out her he chose; and it is remarkable, that he took her that was the most homely and eldest of the number, which made the rest of the Englishmen exceedingly merry; the Spaniards themselves could not help but smile at it; but as it happened, the fellow had the best thought, in choosing one fit for application and business; and indeed she proved the best wife of all the parcel.|$|E
50|$|It is {{impossible}} to express fully the wickedness of this perverse man. Many dioceses were left widowed, and he handed over their administration to laymen. He deposed and suspended many priests who had committed no fault. He irregularly ordained as a metropolitan a boy of twelve, inviting excommunication from his bishops. Not content with that, he consecrated as a metropolitan another boy of only fifteen, as truthful and trustworthy witnesses will confirm. How many unjust betrothals, illicit marriages and irregular unions were contracted on his orders! He allowed one man to take three wives, an abominable crime which shocks the conscience of men and beasts alike. He let another man without either schooling or wit take two wives, in flagrant contravention of our teachings. A third man had his <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> the wife of his father’s brother, a grave and horrible sin. A fourth was allowed to marry the wife of his mother’s brother, a union which the Lawgiver has specifically forbidden. A fifth also, with his approval, sinfully married his godmother, {{who should have been}} to him as a sister or an aunt.|$|E

5000|$|Benny was presumably {{born and}} lived in the dungeons of Legara until being rescued by a fellow prisoner, Krunch. [...] "Adopted" [...] by Krunch she was raised among the Bloodrage Clan and {{frequently}} called his [...] "green kid" [...] or [...] "Gid". Later in life Benny returned to Legara to study as a priestess, where she met {{and fell in love}} with a young man named Sayl. When Sayl's father, the Thief Guild's leader Rojave, discovered their plan to leave Legara for a simple life in the country he attempted to stop them by using his <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> Benny himself. Sayl challenged his father for her hand but was accidentally decapitated in the fight by Rojave, who formalized his marriage to Benny as punishment to her for Sayl's death. Benny then made a deal with Temmet Aelloon to get out of Legara in exchange for her seeking out the legendary Sword of Truth. At some point, just before Benny met Cale and Richard, Aelloon's patience with her search wore out. Recently, returning to Legara once again, Benny confronted Rojave. She was initially beaten in combat and, just before being killed by him, Rojave was killed by Benny's friends. She resurrected Rojave while telling the group her story, only to immediately kill him when he was fully healed. Benny and Cale became closer after the defeat of the Northern Tribes by the Legarans when Cale saved her uncle Rayd from the dwarves and refused to believe her father was dead, eventually becoming lovers. She has, however, become irritated by what she sees as his over-protectiveness (namely taking Dorel with him through the Portal instead of her). When Cale and the Bloodrage returned, she asked where her father was. Upon seeing Krunch was dead she tried to bring him back before being stopped by her uncle Rayd. She shut herself off for two months studying. She admits she blames Cale for Krunch's death, she also admits she's not fair in the thought. It has recently been revealed that her mother is actually Tah'vraay of the Sisters [...] though for reasons unknown this has been deliberately withheld from her by Tah'vraay and Krunch. Benny's biological father is still unknown though she has been called a half-troll on several occasions.|$|E
50|$|The main {{distinction}} between registered partnership and marriage {{was that they}} were covered by separate laws, and that same-sex partnerships were a civil matter and could not be conducted through the church authority. Many people complained about this inequality, asking for a gender-neutral marriage law. Many said they would have liked a gender-neutral marriage that would be conducted solely by the state, as is done in several other countries, rather than the current system in which churches have the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> (legally) <b>marry</b> people, because this would further {{the separation of church and}} state.|$|R

50|$|Increasing {{demand for}} health {{services}} {{led to a}} steady expansion in total staff numbers throughout {{the second half of}} the 20th Century and into the 21st century. However, NHS wage rates were usually comparatively low and hours often long and anti-social. Consequently, under conditions of full employment in the 1950s and 1960s the NHS experienced regular recruitment crises in virtually all categories of staff, particularly doctors and nurses in some peripheral provincial areas. One solution adopted by health <b>authorities</b> was <b>to</b> encourage <b>married</b> nurses <b>to</b> return to the workforce part-time. In Britain, historically many nurses expected to leave work after getting married and into the 1960s senior nursing posts were disproportionately likely to held by unmarried women. Nurse training also had a very high drop out rate, in part related to students leaving <b>to</b> get <b>married</b> (in addition <b>to</b> rejection by some of the strict discipline imposed on them). Part-time work brought many of these women back into the workforce and the NHS was a key site in the growth of this kind of work in post-war Britain, employing 65,000 part-time ancillary staff (mostly domestics) and 79,000 part-time nurses and midwives by 1967.|$|R

50|$|Because Abel Stearns was {{not born}} a Mexican citizen, he had to {{petition}} the Los Angeles civil government <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> Arcadia.

While the gap in their ages was substantial, at 29 years (and Stearns himself claimed <b>to</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> be 40 rather than 43, perhaps to make the gap smaller), it was relatively common at this time for very young californias <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> significantly older Euro-American men.
