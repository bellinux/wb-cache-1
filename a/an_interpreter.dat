5|$|The {{idea that}} would spawn Microsoft {{initiated}} when Paul Allen showed Bill Gates {{the first of}} January, 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that demonstrated the Altair 8800. Allen and Gates saw potential to develop an implementation of the programming language BASIC interpreter for the system. Bill Gates called the creators of the new microcomputer, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), offering to demonstrate the implementation {{in order to win}} a contract with the company. Allen and Gates had neither <b>an</b> <b>interpreter</b> nor an Altair system, yet in the eight weeks before the demo, they developed <b>an</b> <b>interpreter.</b> When Allen flew to Albuquerque to meet with MITS, the interpreter worked and MITS agreed to distribute Altair BASIC. Allen and Gates left Boston, where Allen worked for Honeywell and Gates was enrolled in Harvard, moved to Albuquerque (where MITS was located), and co-founded Microsoft there. Revenues of the company totaled $16,005 by the end of 1976.|$|E

50|$|Tcl Blend is a Tcl {{extension}} {{that makes}} use of JNI to facilitate communication between <b>a</b> Java <b>interpreter</b> and <b>a</b> Tcl <b>interpreter.</b> Tcl Blend is typically used to load <b>a</b> Java <b>interpreter</b> into <b>an</b> existing Tcl process, so that functionality implemented in Java can be accessed in a Tcl script. For example, one could allocate a Java object in a Tcl script and interactively invoke Java methods on the object.|$|R

5|$|ASL is {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{cited as the}} third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States. These figures misquote Schein and Delk (1974), who actually concluded that ASL speakers constituted the third-largest population requiring <b>an</b> <b>interpreter</b> in court. Although this would make ASL the third-most used language among monolinguals other than English, it {{does not imply that}} it is the fourth-most-spoken language in the United States, since speakers of other languages may also speak English.|$|E

5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as <b>an</b> <b>interpreter.</b> It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E

After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 {{as director of the}} Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler—who had converted to Catholicism to secure the post—experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti-Semitic press.
