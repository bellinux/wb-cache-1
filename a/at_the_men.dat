25|$|During a field firing {{exercise}} at a rest camp in Bangalore, a rifle grenade misfired and fell only eight yards from his section. The twenty-eight-year-old soldier rushed forward, shouting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> to take cover {{and attempted to}} throw it to a safe distance. It exploded in his hand, wounding him fatally, but his self-sacrifice saved his comrades from harm.|$|E

25|$|On 14 March 2009, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>MEN</b> Arena in Manchester, England, Khan {{defeated}} Barrera, by {{a technical}} decision. The fight was stopped {{towards the end}} of the fifth round due to Barrera suffering a cut in the first round, which resulted from a clash of heads. With Barrera deemed in no position to fight on by the ringside doctor, the fight then went to the scorecards where Khan was ahead on all three (50–44, 50–45, 50–45). With victory, Khan defended his WBA International lightweight title and also won the vacant WBO Inter-Continental lightweight title.|$|E

25|$|Later that year, Gan Ning {{participated in}} Sun Quan's {{campaign}} to {{seize control of}} Hefei, which was defended by Cao Cao's general Zhang Liao. Sun Quan was unable to capture Hefei after besieging the city for days and suffering defeats in the initial skirmishes, and he eventually withdrew his forces when a plague broke out in his army. Sun Quan's other units retreated first, while Sun remained behind at Xiaoyao Ford (逍遙津) with only about 1,000 men and a few officers (including Lü Meng, Jiang Qin, Ling Tong and Gan Ning). When Zhang Liao saw that, he {{seized the opportunity to}} launch a devastating counterattack and throw the enemy into confusion. Gan Ning led a group of archers to fire arrows at the enemy while Ling Tong and the others fought fiercely to protect their lord. Gan Ning shouted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> to beat the war drums and blow the horns loudly to raise the army's morale. Sun Quan eventually succeeded in escaping but his forces sustained heavy losses. He praised Gan Ning for his acts of courage after the battle.|$|E

25|$|On August 9, 1861, Lt. Col. Manuel Antonio Chaves of the New Mexico Volunteer Militia took {{command of}} a {{garrison}} of three companies numbering 8 officers and 206 men at Fort Fauntleroy. Chaves was later {{accused of being}} frugal in dispensing his post's supplies to the 1,000 or more Navajos that had remained close to the fort, and was maintaining remarkably lax discipline. Horse races began on September 10 and continued into the late afternoon of September 13. Col. Chaves permitted Post Sutler A.W.Kavanaugh to supply liquor freely to the Navajos. There was a dispute about which horse won a race. A shot rang out, followed by a fusillade. Almost immediately 200 Navajo, well-armed and mounted, advanced towards the Guard, shooting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>men.</b> They were fired upon by the soldiers, and scattered leaving 12 dead bodies and forty prisoners. On hearing this, Gen. Canby demanded a full report from Chaves, who did not comply. Col. Canby sent Captain Andrew W. Evans to the fort, named Fort Lyon since September 25, and he took command. Manuel Chaves, suspended from command, was confined {{to the limits of}} Albuquerque pending court martial. (The charges were dismissed after two months.) In February1861, Manuel Chaves took the field with 400 militia and ransacked Navajo land, basically without federal authority.|$|E

He retained his WBU title in his next two fights against Justin Juuko and Leva Kirakosyan with knockout wins. Gomez then faced Argentinian boxer [...] "El Vikingo" [...] Javier Osvaldo Alvarez in February 2005, once again fighting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>MEN</b> Arena in Manchester. WBO super middleweight title holder Joe Calzaghe {{had been scheduled to}} top the bill but pulled out of his arranged fight, and Gomez and Alvarez were slotted as the main attraction.|$|E

Berrabah, Buchanan and other group member Heidi Range join together and walk on a bridge, which is constructed by the men's bodies. Later, Buchanan straddles onto two men who pretend to be a motorbike. Berrabah and Range then drive a car made from the men's bodies. During the milk bar scene, the trio are surrounded by men who are used as tables and lamps. Another scene shows Berrabah and Range in a car constructed by the men. At the end of the video, Range uses a microphone to yell <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> who are standing in a line.|$|E
500|$|As in Libya, Mackay {{shared the}} hardships {{of living in the}} field with his men, and {{impressed}} them by his coolness during air raids. They watched him sit in the open during attacks; on one such occasion on 19 April 1941, Mackay waited out a two-and-a-half-hour raid when his car was hit and his driver wounded. One staff officer [...] "noticed Mackay moving in front of his tent quite unconcerned about the movement of enemy planes. He neither looked at the planes nor <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> dashing about, but they saw him, and those moving towards shelter stopped, and many of those who had gained shelter returned to their duties. Personal example is the only paying proposition in such circumstances". For his actions in Greece, he was mentioned in despatches a sixth time, and awarded the Greek War Cross (First Class).|$|E

500|$|On 17 October, all men aged 18 to 60 {{were ordered}} to report for a meeting, but were {{detained}} overnight instead on the pretext that someone had fired shots in the village the previous night. The detainees were beaten, and otherwise abused that night. Approximately 20 were released in the morning, and the rest {{were told that they}} were assigned to grape harvest duty. The civilians walked out of the village under a military escort. One of the civilians was killed by the guards, before the group reached a point within [...] of the Vukovar–Tovarnik road, where they were ordered into a cloverfield at gunpoint. The men were told to hold hands and sweep their feet in front of them across the ground. The JNA had previously placed land mines in the field. Several mines were set off, while the troops guarding the civilian detainees fired <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> in the field. The survivors were then forced to retrieve the dead and injured and clear the remaining mines. Out of 50 civilians forced into the minefield, 21 were killed in the minefield itself. The number of persons wounded by mine explosions or gunfire is variously reported as 14 or 15. Three more civilians were killed in Lovas by the end of November.|$|E
500|$|The Germans {{knew the}} {{invasion}} was imminent {{if not the}} exact location; Major Schmidt, {{in command of the}} bridges, had been told that they were {{one of the most critical}} points in Normandy. The defenders however were not on full alert and only two sentries were on duty when the gliders landed. The sound of a gunshot alerted the two sentries on the canal bridge. As Brotheridge's platoon attacked, one ran off shouting [...] "paratroops" [...] while the second fired a flare gun to alert nearby defenders. Brotheridge shot him while other members of his platoon cleared the trenches and pillbox with grenades. Alerted by the flare, the German machine gunners opened fire <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> on the bridge, wounding Brotheridge as he threw a grenade. The grenade silenced one of the machine gun positions and another was taken out by Bren gun fire. Number One Platoon crossed the bridge to take up a defensive position on the west bank. The Royal Engineers from number one glider searched for explosive charges and cut the fuse wires when they found any. Smith's platoon crossed the bridge next, exchanging fire with the German defenders, whereupon Smith was wounded by a grenade. Using grenades and sub-machine gun fire, the platoons cleared the trenches and bunkers. By 00:21 German resistance on the west bank of the canal bridge was over. Checking the area, the men of Brotheridge's platoon now realised that their leader was wounded. He failed to recover and soon died of his wounds, becoming the first Allied soldier killed by enemy action during the invasion. On the east bank, Wood's platoon cleared the trenches and bunkers with little opposition. Woods was hit in the leg by machine-gun fire as he ordered the platoon to storm the German defences. All three platoon commanders at the canal bridge were now either dead or wounded.|$|E
500|$|The 3rd Infantry Division {{was part}} of an {{offensive}} plan to break through German resistance in northeastern France, as far as Saint-Dié-des-Vosges. In the area of Genevreuille on 15 September 1944, Murphy narrowly escaped death from a mortar shell hit that killed two others and wounded three. Although his resulting heel wound was not serious, he received his first Purple Heart. By this point, all but Murphy and two others of Company B's original group had either been killed or taken off the lines with wounds. General O'Daniel moved the 15th Infantry, 3rd Division to the Moselle and the Cleurie river valley in late September. Stone quarries dotted the hills and provided good defensive positions for the Germans. The 15th was met with fierce resistance north of St. Ame at the heavily fortified multi-tunneled L'Omet quarry. On 2 October at L'Omet, Murphy advanced alone to the location of a machine gun manned by a unit of German soldiers. Within [...] of the machine gun nest, he rose to his feet. [...] "The Germans spot me instantly", he recalled. [...] "The gunner spins the tip of his weapon toward me. But the barrel catches in a limb, and the burst whizzes to my right". Murphy lobbed two hand grenades <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> killing four and wounding three. He was awarded the Silver Star for this action. The 15th achieved success in its continued attack when Germans began evacuating the quarry on 5 October. On that date, Murphy, while carrying a SCR-536 radio, advanced alone for [...] towards the Germans while they continually fired directly at him. Around [...] from the Germans' location, he relayed firing orders by radio to the artillery, and remained at his position alone for an hour directing his men. When Murphy's men finally took the hill, 15 German combatants were killed and 35 wounded. Murphy's actions earned him an Oak Leaf Cluster for his Silver Star.|$|E

The fight was overshadowed by Amir Khan's first defeat {{later on the}} same card. On 6 December 2008, Harrison's career seemed all but over as he was defeated by {{the winner of the}} first Prizefighter tournament and Belfast taxi driver, Martin Rogan.

2500|$|Hearing the gunshots, Minister of War Nazım Pasha {{stepped out}} of his room and rushed towards the raid party.
