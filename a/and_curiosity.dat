5|$|Vincent DiStephano was not {{included}} in the original screenplay for Alien: Resurrection, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet admired Cruz' previous work and had casting director Rick Pagano arrange a meeting. DiStephano was added to the cast as the remaining soldier and guide for the band of survivors. In Alien Zone II: The Spaces of Science-fiction Cinema, Annette Kuhn calls DiStephano's death at the hands of the Newborn a perverse joke because of its juxtaposition of infantile features <b>and</b> <b>curiosity</b> with gruesome killing.|$|E
5|$|All known {{isotopes}} of curium are radioactive {{and have}} a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. They predominantly emit α-particles, and the heat released in this process {{can serve as a}} heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, but this application is hindered by the scarcity, high cost, and radioactivity of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the 238Pu radionuclide for power sources in artificial pacemakers. It served as the α-source in the alpha particle X-ray spectrometers installed on several space probes, including the Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity <b>and</b> <b>Curiosity</b> Mars rovers and the Philae lander on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to analyze the composition and structure of the surface.|$|E

5|$|The Electra {{communications}} package is a UHF software-defined radio (SDR) {{that provides a}} flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. In addition to protocol controlled inter-spacecraft data links of 1kbit/s to 2Mbit/s, Electra also provides Doppler data collection, open loop recording and a highly accurate timing service based on a 5e13USO. Doppler information for approaching vehicles {{can be used for}} final descent targeting or descent and landing trajectory recreation. Doppler information on landed vehicles will also enable scientists to accurately determine the surface location of Mars landers and rovers. The two MER spacecraft currently on Mars utilize an earlier generation UHF relay radio providing similar functions through the Mars Odyssey orbiter. The Electra radio has proven its functionality by relaying information to and from the MER spacecraft, Phoenix Mars lander <b>and</b> <b>Curiosity</b> rover.|$|E

25|$|Post-battle, East Cemetery Hill was {{occupied}} {{for several weeks}} by state militiamen, who established a tented camp site to maintain a military presence, secure the battlefield from looters <b>and</b> <b>curiosity</b> seekers, collect remaining military weapons, and provide manpower and services for the area's hospitals. Elizabeth C. Thorn (pregnant wife of the keeper of Evergreen Cemetery who was at war), her parents, and hired hands dug 105 graves for soldiers killed at or near Cemetery Hill.|$|E
25|$|The salvage yard, {{which was}} {{situated}} near Noels Pond on , was finished to partial occupancy {{by the fall}} of 1954 and completed in 1955. Thirty Butler Buildings (prefabricated steel) were located on the property. The machinery which constructed the bypass road was buried {{at the end of the}} property when it became over used and obsolete in 1959/1960, under the supervision of Warrant Officer Ebb Higdon, Company A. They were later dug up to be sold for scrap but were found to be useless and reburied. This equipment had come up from Florida in Liberty ships, with the battalion in 1953. In 1986, when this information was made available to the town of Stephenville via a series of articles in the Georgian newspaper, several doubters <b>and</b> <b>curiosity</b> seekers, armed with metal detectors, swarmed over the site and located the buried equipment.|$|E
25|$|While {{in prison}} he was {{transferred}} to the Bridgewater State Hospital. On March 22, 1984, he changed his name to Nathaniel Benjamin Levi Bar-Jonah. He gave several reasons for changing his name. Bar-Jonah told friends and relatives that he changed his name because he wanted to {{know what it was like}} to be discriminated against and persecuted as a Jew. During a later interview with Dr. Michael Stone for the television show Most Evil, he claimed he was Jewish and wanted his name to reflect that. Later in the same year, Superior Court Judge Walter E. Steele ruled that Massachusetts had failed to prove that Bar-Jonah was dangerous and he was released before moving to Great Falls, Montana. During this time, Bar-Jonah confided in his psychiatrists that he had a deep fascination <b>and</b> <b>curiosity</b> with the taste of human flesh, and had innumerable murderous fantasies.|$|E

25|$|Engineering interplanetary {{journeys}} {{is complicated}} and {{the exploration of}} Mars has experienced a high failure rate, especially the early attempts. Roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failed before completing their missions and some failed before their observations could begin. Some missions have met with unexpected success, such as the twin Mars Exploration Rovers, which operated for years beyond their specification. As of 16 October 2017, two scientific rovers were {{on the surface of}} Mars beaming signals back to Earth (Opportunity of the Mars Exploration Rover mission <b>and</b> <b>Curiosity</b> of the Mars Science Laboratory mission), with six orbiters surveying the planet: Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Orbiter Mission, MAVEN, and the Trace Gas Orbiter, which have contributed massive amounts of information about Mars. No sample return missions have been attempted for Mars and an attempted return mission for Mars' moon Phobos (Fobos-Grunt) failed.|$|E
25|$|Michael Shanks as Daniel Jackson (Seasons 1–5 and 7–10 main, Season 6 recurring) – A {{brilliant}} Egyptologist whose far-fetched {{theories about}} Egyptian pyramids having been built by aliens {{led to his}} participation in the original Stargate mission in the feature film (where he was played by James Spader). He joins the SG-1 team to facilitate his search for his wife, who was kidnapped by Apophis in the pilot episode, but his naïveté <b>and</b> <b>curiosity</b> regularly create obstacles for the team. He gradually evolves from being an archaeologist and translator, into the moral conscience for the team, and remains part of SG-1 until he ascends to a higher plane of existence {{at the end of}} Season 5. Following his forceful de-ascension at the beginning of Season 7, he rejoins SG-1 {{for the remainder of the}} series. The last three seasons show his flirty, yet antagonistic relationship with Vala Mal Doran. Daniel also appears in both direct-to-DVD films, in Seasons 1 and 5 of Stargate Atlantis and in three Stargate Universe episodes.|$|E

[...] Dave Hughes, writing in Slant Magazine, stated: [...] "Ten years on, Aquemini is the single strongest aspect {{of one of the}} art form's deepest benches. Snappier and more experimental than the pair's early work, and focused enough to feel comfortable in a sprawl, it's the moment when OutKast came fully into itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Lopez {{arrived on}} the red carpet of the 42nd Grammy Awards in the company of then-boyfriend Sean Combs; he was dressed in a gray suit. Although the fashion house Versace had only loaned the dress, it {{subsequently}} decided to give it away as a token of gratitude for the enormous publicity generated. The singer immediately monopolized the attention <b>and</b> <b>curiosity</b> of the public and photographers at the event. Actor David Duchovny appeared on stage with Lopez to present the award for Best R Album and declared to the audience, [...] "This {{is the first time in}} five or six years that I'm sure that nobody is looking at me", eliciting laughter from the audience and Lopez.|$|E
500|$|The Emperor {{proceeded}} to visit Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Italy, Egypt, Greece, Switzerland and France. In Coburg he visited his daughter's tomb.

He spent his days sightseeing and conversing with scientists and other intellectuals with whom he shared interests. The European sojourn {{proved to be a}} success, and his demeanor <b>and</b> <b>curiosity</b> won respectful notices in the nations which he visited. The prestige of both Brazil and PedroII were further enhanced during the tour when news came from Brazil that the Law of Free Birth, abolishing the last source of enslavement, had been ratified.
