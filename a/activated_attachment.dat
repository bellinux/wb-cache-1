40|$|This study {{examined}} the relation between attachment characteristics and intimacy experienced after one?s attachment style is <b>activated.</b> <b>Attachment</b> theory states that when an individual feels threatened by an attachment figure, attachment style is activated and dictates how that individual relates {{to his or her}} partner in that situation. This study tests this theory. Data were collected on 110 committed romantic couples from the community. Each individual completed a series of questionnaires, including the Adult Attachment Questionnaire. Couples then engaged in a series of four videotaped interactions in which both partners had an opportunity to discuss times in which their feelings were hurt by someone other than their partner and times in which their feelings were hurt by their partner. These interactions were regarded as low- and high-risk, respectively. The high-risk interaction was specifically targeted to activate attachment style and elicit attachment behaviors. Analyses were conducted using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM). This model takes into account the interdependence of observations between partners. As a function of this model, both actor effects (the effect one?s own attachment style has on one?s own experiences of intimacy) and partner effects (the effect one?s own attachment style has on one?s partner?s experiences of intimacy) were examined. Intimacy was conceptualized in two different manners: state (post-interaction intimacy) and trait (overall intimacy in the relationship). It was hypothesized that individuals with insecure attachment characteristics would report lower feelings of both state and trait intimacy compared to securely attached individuals. It was also predicted that the partners of individuals with insecure attachment characteristics would report lower state and trait intimacy following the high-risk interaction compared to partners of secure individuals. The results of this study supported these hypotheses. Models testing the effect of the attachment characteristics avoidance, ambivalence, and avoidance-x-ambivalence found a relation between the presence of insecure attachment characteristics and lower levels of both state and trait intimacy. Implications of these results and future directions of study are discussed...|$|E

Bowlby described what is likely to happen if such a case occurs, “Whenever the natural object of attachment behavior is unavailable, the behavior can become directed towards some substitute object. Even though it is inanimate, such an object frequently appears capable of filling the role of an important, though subsidiary, attachment ‘figure.’ Like the principal attachment figure, the inanimate substitute is sought especially when a child is tired, ill or distressed”.|$|R

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{presenting}} incidental reminders of death, a manipulation referred to as mortality salience, increases unconscious accessibility of death thoughts and, in turn, increases the use of various defense mechanisms to reduce such thoughts.

Because self-reports do not verify causality, the current study aimed to establish a causal relationship between attachment and terror management. It was posited that experimentally <b>activating</b> a secure <b>attachment</b> schema after mortality salience should decrease unconscious accessibility of death thoughts, whereas <b>activating</b> an insecure <b>attachment</b> schema should increase accessibility of death thoughts (i. e., {{there should be a}} Mortality Salience x Attachment Priming interaction).

University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 This {{study examined the}} relationships between attachment style, empathy, relationship perfectionism, and relationship quality among a sample of adults currently in a romantic relationship. Based on previous research and conceptual reasoning, {{it was hypothesized that}} both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance would be negatively related to constructive conflict resolution and relationship satisfaction, that empathy would be positively related to constructive conflict resolution and relationship satisfaction, and that relationship perfectionism would be negatively related to constructive conflict resolution and relationship satisfaction. In addition, this study examined the hypothesized mediation effects that both empathy and relationship perfectionism would serve as partial mediators in the relationships between attachment and relationship quality variables of constructive conflict resolution and satisfaction. Because <b>attachment</b> styles are <b>activated</b> during times of distress and conflict (Pietromonaco, Greenwood, & Barrett, 2004), the present study used three different priming conditions (i. e., discomfort related to attachment partner, neutral discomfort, and no discomfort) to <b>activate</b> <b>attachment</b> systems of randomly assigned participants. It was hypothesized that when attachment style was primed, the mediating effects would be greater in magnitude. Using online and paper-and-pencil classroom methods, 556 participants who were currently in a romantic relationship for at least one month were recruited from 23 U. S. states. Results revealed that higher levels of avoidant and anxious attachment led to poor conflict resolution strategies and poorer relationship satisfaction, and that relationship perfectionism served as a mediator for both of these relationships. Clinical implications, study limitations, and future research are discussed. Introduction [...] Review of literature [...] Methodology [...] Results [...] Discussion [...] Appendix - Measure...|$|R

Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure.

Proteins are made from amino acids that have been <b>activated</b> by <b>attachment</b> to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase.

5|$|As {{both the}} amine and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of amino acids can {{react to form}} amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage.

This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase.

We further found that all DCNLs interact with most Cullin subtypes, but that they are likely responsible for the neddylation of different subpopulations of any given Cullin. This is consistent {{with the fact that the}} subcellular localization of DCNLs in tissue culture cells differs and that they show unique tissue specific expression patterns in mice.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The study investigates {{individual}} differences in the mental representation of attachment {{and their impact on}} the cortisol response to psychosocial stress in idiopathic spasmodic torticollis (IST). It was hypothesized (a) that in IST insecure attachment is more prevalent than in a non-clinical control group and (b) that subjects with dismissing attachment respond with higher physiological arousal to a specific stimulus <b>activating</b> the <b>attachment</b> behavioural system than subjects with secure attachment. METHOD: 20 patients with IST and 20 healthy controls matched for age and sex underwent the Adult Attachment Interview, an hour-long, semiclinical interview on attachment experiences. During the interview salivary cortisol levels were monitored. The subjects' mental state with regard to attachment was classified using the attachment Q-sort method. Anxiety and depression were measured as potential covariates of the adrenocortical stress response. RESULTS: Compared to the non-clinical group, dismissing attachment was strongly overrepresented in IST. In IST, but not in the healthy control group, dismissing attachment correlated with an elevated cortisol response to the interview. CONCLUSION: In clinical, but not in non-clinical samples dismissing attachment may be associated with increased vulnerability to psychosocial stress.

40|$|In couple relationships, intense or {{protracted}} conflict can <b>activate</b> the <b>attachment</b> system, raising {{concerns about}} the partner 2 ̆ 7 s availability {{and the future of}} the relationship. Hence, individuals with different attachment orientations are expected to respond differntly to conflict. This article summarises a series of studies into adult attachment and conflict processes, examining four issues: conflicts regarding closeness and distance in dating couples, pattern of marital conflict, reactions to anger-evoking and hurtful events, and the role of attachment and conflict patterns in the intergenerational transmission of relationship difficulties. The studies point to complex links between attachment and conflict variables. Insecurity - particularly attachment anxiety - is associated with high levels of conflict, and with maladaptive responses such as coercion and conflict avoidance. These conflict behaviors are likely to fuel disagreement, hence maintaining or exacerbating insecurity. There is also evidence that insecurity and maladaptive behaviors create relational dissatisfaction. Research further suggests that parents 2 ̆ 7 insecurity and destructive conflict behaviors have negative consequences for adolescent offspring, in terms of attachment difficulties and appraisals of loneliness. These findings highlight the importance of interventions designed to ameliorate insecurities and communications difficulties...|$|R
40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The {{results of}} the implant overdenture {{treatment}} in the maxilla remains inferior {{to those in the}} mandible. Different reasons have been alluded to, such as bone quality and quantity, number of implants, as well as the prosthesis design. PURPOSE: To investigate the latter, a new design for the rehabilitation of the resorbed maxillae was set up. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirteen patients were selected and provided with four endosseous maxillary implants, splinted with a rigid-cast bar. RESULTS: After a mean loading time of 3 years, six implants were lost; three at abutment and another three shortly after abutment connection, resulting in a cumulative success rate of 88. 6 % at year 4. A mean marginal bone loss of 0. 3 mm was observed within the first year. After the first year, the marginal bone level, the attachment level, and the Periotest scores hardly changed. The main prosthetic complication was the frequent need to renew or to <b>activate</b> the <b>attachments.</b> A strong improvement in patient satisfaction was observed when compared with the old conventional denture.

40|$|AbstractThe spindle {{checkpoint}} inhibits anaphase {{until all}} chromosomes have established bipolar attachment. Two kinetochore states trigger this checkpoint. The absence of microtubules <b>activates</b> the <b>attachment</b> response, while {{the inability of}} attached microtubules to generate tension triggers the tension/orientation response [1, 2]. The single aurora kinase of budding yeast, Ipl 1, {{is required for the}} tension/orientation, but not attachment, response [3]. In contrast, we find that the single aurora kinase of fission yeast, Ark 1, is required for the attachment response. Having established that the initiator codon assigned to ark 1 + was incorrect and that Ark 1 -associated kinase activity depended upon survivin function and phosphorylation, we found that the loss of Ark 1 from kinetochores by either depletion or use of a survivin mutant overides the checkpoint response to microtubule depolymerization. Ark 1 /survivin function was not required for the association of Bub 1 or Mad 3 with the kinetochores. However, it was required for two aspects of Mad 2 function that accompany checkpoint activation: full-scale association with kinetochores and formation of a complex with Mad 3. Neither the phosphorylation of histone H 3 that accompanies chromosome condensation nor condensin recruitment to mitotic chromatin were seen when Ark 1 function was compromised.

This thesis has sought to understand how attachment influences the experience of both the person with dementia and their caregiver. Part one presents a literature review on the ‘interactive attachment dyad’ between the person with dementia and caregiver. Findings suggested that interactions within the dyad is a complex phenomenon. Conflicting results across papers highlighted difficulty in understanding how attachment influences the reciprocal interactions that take place between people with dementia and caregivers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The T 4 {{bacteriophage}} {{consists of}} a head, filled with double-stranded DNA, and a complex contractile tail required for the ejection of the viral genome into the Escherichia coli host. The tail has a baseplate to whïch are attached six long and six short tail fibers. These fibers are the sensing devices for recognizing the host. When <b>activated</b> by <b>attachment</b> to cell receptors, the fibers cause a conformational transition in the baseplate and subsequently in the tail sheath, which initiates DNA ejection. The baseplate is a multisubunit complex of proteins encoded by 15 genes. Gene product 9 (gp 9) is the protein that connects the long tail fibers to the baseplate and triggers the tail contraction after virus attachment to a host cell. RESULTS: The crystal structure of recombinant gp 9, determined to 2. 3 A resolution, shows that the protein of 288 amino acid residues assembles as a homotrimer. The monomer consists of three domains: the N-terminal domain generates a triple coiled coil; the middle domain is a mixed, seven-stranded beta sandwich with a topology not previously observed; and the C-terminal domain is an eight-stranded, antiparallel beta sandwich having some resemblance to 'jelly-roll' viral capsid protein structures. CONCLUSIONS: The biologically active form of gp 9 is a trimer. The protein contains flexible interdomain hinges, which are presumably required to facilitate signal transmission between the long tail fibers and the baseplate. Structural and genetic analyses show that the C-terminal domain is bound to the baseplate, and the N-terminal coiled-coil domain {{is associated with the}} long tail fibers. status: publishe...|$|R

In Study 1, we asked 324 college students to describe their coping behaviors in the daily situations that had evoked negative affects, and qualitatively analyzed what coping strategies (ABS vs. SRCS) they used more frequently in such attachment situations. In Study 2, we examined situational consistency of attachment behaviors across 12 attachment situations for 4 attachment styles, which was theoretically assumed but never tested, in addition to quantitatively replicating the findings of Study 1. The main findings of two studies were as follows: (1) Adults used ABS to the same or less extent than SRCS.

Cell attachment to FN did not rapidly influence p 21 CIP 1 mRNA levels, while the protein stability of p 21 CIP 1 was decreased. Importantly, the down-regulation of p 21 CIP 1 and p 27 KIP 1 was completely blocked by three distinct proteasome inhibitors, demonstrating that integrin ligation induced proteasomal degradation of these Cdk 2 inhibitors. Interestingly, ECM-induced proteasomal proteolysis of a ubiquitination-deficient p 21 CIP 1 mutant (p 21 K 6 R) also occurred, showing that the proteasomal degradation of p 21 CIP 1 was ubiquitin independent. Concomitant with our finding that the small GTPases Cdc 42 and Rac 1 were <b>activated</b> by <b>attachment</b> to FN, constitutively active (ca) Cdc 42 and ca Rac 1 promoted down-regulation of p 21 CIP 1. However, dominant negative (dn) Cdc 42 and dn Rac 1 mutants blocked the anchorage-induced degradation of p 21 CIP 1, suggesting that an integrin-induced Cdc 42 /Rac 1 signaling pathway activates proteasomal degradation of p 21 CIP 1. Our results indicate that integrin-regulated proteasomal proteolysis might contribute to anchorage-dependent cell cycle control...|$|R
