Two promising methods have been quantitatively tested and compared to an exhaustive search. The number of combinations and CPU time are greatly reduced. When a preferred tolerance range is specified for each process, the process search methods have difficulty due to the presence of local minima.

The appropriate <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerances</b> among the different parts of an assembly is the fundamental tool to ensure assemblies that work rightly at lower costs. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a tolerance analysis to satisfy the requirements of the assembly by the tolerances imposed on the single parts.

Actually there are some different models used or proposed by the literature to make the tolerance analysis of an assembly constituted by rigid parts, but none of them is completely and univocally accepted.

40|$|Given that {{achieving}} nominal (all {{dimensions are}} theoretically perfect) geometry is challenging during building construction, understanding and anticipating sources of geometric variation through tolerances modeling and allocation is critical. However, existing building modeling environments lack {{the ability to}} support coordinated, incremental and systematic specification of manufacturing and construction requirements. This issue becomes evident when adding multi-material systems produced off site by different vendors during building erection. Current practices to improve this situation include costly and time-consuming operations that challenge the relationship among the stakeholders of a project. As one means to overcome this issue, this research proposes {{the development of a}} knowledge-aided modeling framework that integrates a parametric CAD tool with a system modeling application to assess variability in building construction. The CAD tool provides robust geometric modeling capabilities, while System Modeling allows for the specification of feature-based manufacturing requirements aligned with construction standards and construction processes know-how. The system facilitates the identification of conflicting interactions between tolerances and manufacturing specifications of building material systems. The expected contributions of this project are the representation of manufacturing knowledge and tolerances interaction across off-site building subsystems to identify conflicting manufacturing requirements and minimize costly construction errors. The proposed approach will store and allocate manufacturing knowledge as Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) design specifications for both single and multiple material systems. Also, as new techniques in building design and construction are beginning to overlap with engineering methods and standards (e. g. in-factory prefabrication), this project seeks to create collaborative scenarios between MBSE and Building Information Modeling (BIM) based on parametric, simultaneous, software integration to reduce human-to-data translation errors, improving model consistency among domains.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques to support human designers. The thesis argues that support for human designers can be improved by adopting an Al-based rather than a geometry-based approach to engineering design. Design Support Systems (DSSs) are proposed as an effective means of delivering this improved support. Representing and reasoning about tolerance statements in design is introduced as a valid area to test these claims. Tolerance statements describe the allowable variations in the geometry of a designed artefact. Two distinct, but related problems involving the use of toler¬ ance statements in design are tackled, namely: tolerance combination (including the way tolerance distributions combine), and <b>tolerance</b> <b>allocation.</b> The problem <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> combination (and distribution) involves determining the necessary consequences of the application <b>of</b> known <b>tolerance</b> statements to one or more designed artefact features. Tolerance allocation concerns the assignment of tol¬ erance statements during the design process. Solutions to this second problem are essential before manufactured instances of designed artefacts can be tested for compliance with design descriptions. The use of an experimental DSS, the Edinburgh Designer System (EDS), to solve design problems is illustrated. The implementation of techniques to im¬ prove the support <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> combination and tolerance allocation is described and where possible has been tested using EDS. The way that design is situated within the product creation process is investigated and the derivation of parts list information from an EDS design description is demonstrated.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The {{fundamental}} {{objective of}} a design engineer in performing tolerance technology is to transform functional requirements into tolerances on individual parts based on existing data and algorithms for design tolerance analysis and synthesis. The transformation of functional requirements into tolerances must {{also consider the}} existing process capabilities and manufacturing costs to determine the optimal tolerances and processes. The main objective {{of this research is}} to present an integrated but modular system for Computer Aided Tolerance Allocation, Tolerance Synthesis and Process Selection. The module is implemented in AutoCAD using the ARX 1. 1 (AutoCAD Runtime Extension Libraries), MFC 4. 2, Visual C++ 4. 2, Access 7. 0, AutoCAD Development System, AutoLISP, and Other AutoCAD Customization tools. The integrated module has two functions: a. Tolerance analysis and allocation: This module uses several statistical and optimization techniques to aggregate component tolerances. Random number generators are used to simulate historical data used by most of the optimization techniques to perform tolerance analysis. Various component tolerance distributions are considered (Beta, Normal, and Uniform). The proposed analysis technique takes into consideration the distribution of each fabrication of the component, this provides designers. The proposed tolerance analysis method takes into consideration the distribution of each fabrication process of the assembly. For assemblies with non-normal natural process tolerance distributions, this method allows designers to assign assembly tolerances that are closer to actual assembly tolerances when compared to other statistical methods. This is verified by comparing the proposed tolerance analysis method to the results of Monte Carlo simulations. The method results in assembly tolerances similar to those provided by Monte Carlo simulation yet is significantly less computationally-intensive. b. Process Selection: This thesis introduces a methodology for concurrent design that considers the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerances</b> and manufacturing processes for minimum cost. This methodology brings manufacturing concerns into the design process. A simulated annealing technique is used to solve the optimization problem. Independent, unordered, manufacturing processes are assumed for each assembly. The optimization technique uses Monte Carlo simulation. A simulated annealing technique is used to control the Monte Carlo analysis. In this optimization technique, tolerances are allocated using the cost-tolerance curves for each of the individual components. A cost-tolerance curve is defined for each component part in the assembly. The optimization algorithm varies the tolerance for each component and searches systematically for the combination of tolerances that minimizes the cost. The proposed tolerance allocation/process selection method was found to be superior to other tolerance allocation methods based on manufacturing costs...|$|E
40|$|Cardan joint {{is a very}} {{widely used}} {{assembly}} in many mechanical fields [1]. It is comprised of an {{input and output shafts}} with two forks and a cross. Each fork hole is connected to a cross pin by means of a revolute joint. In transmission simulations, it is often included using a “black box” approach, by adding coupling relationships between the relative velocities of the connected shafts. On the other side, in many applications, it is also necessary to model and simulate the joint in details in order to assess the internal reaction forces between pins and holes. The most severe complication is that the Cardan joint is an overconstrained system. In standard multibody simulations in which the kinematic restraints are modeled introducing constraint equations, this may lead to the indeterminacy of the reaction forces. Moreover, in an overconstrained system, it is impossible {{to take into account the}} effect of manufacturing and assembling errors that are always present in the actual parts. In fact, the presence of these errors is somewhat managed by the clearances and elasticity of the components which are in general neglected in a rigid body model with kinematic constraint equations. Scientific literature often reports study on universal joints by simplifying the mechanism deleting the overabundant constraints [2 - 6]. Other studies in multibody dynamics introduce the presence of clearances in revolute and cylindrical for overcoming the redundancies [7]. In order to avoid all these problems and to produce a multibody model able to take into account the effects of elasticity and manufacturing errors, a specific modeling technique has been used. All the kinematic pin-hole constraints have been replaced by penalty systems of two intelligent nonlinear piecewise springs by using the approach proposed by Brutti et al. [8] According to this approach, the springs have variable stiffness and damping characteristics in order to take into account different types of contact (line contact, single point contact, two-point contact). Moreover, the joint forks and cross pins have been modeled using the discrete flexible multibody techniques by splitting the rigid beam-shaped bodies into several smaller bodies connected by matrix spring elements that simulate the elastic compliance of the structure. Several design scenarios have been simulated including geometrical and dimensional errors of components. In particular, four errors have been included: position error on the alignment of the holes of one of the fork, angular misalignment between the holes of one of the fork, angular misalignment on the alignment of two perpendicular pins of the cross, position error of one of the pin of the cross. The influence of these errors on the performance of the joint have been evaluated in terms of kinematic parameters (velocity and acceleration of the output shaft with respect to the input one) and in terms of dynamic parameters (forces between pin and holes). The results are presented in graphs and tables using dimensionless influence parameters. They can be used for the optimization of the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerances</b> and for improving the design of Cardan Joint in specific field such as high-speed mechanisms, precision devices, high-efficiency driveline, etc...|$|E

In the model formulation, goals such as crop production, net profit, water and labor requirements, and machine utilization are modeled as fuzzy. A tolerance based FGP technique is used to quantify fuzziness of different goals for the problem. The fuzzy goals are transformed to linear constraints by introducing tolerance variables. The program then minimizes {{the values of the}} weighted sum <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> allowance variables for the highest membership grades, providing the most satisfactory set <b>of</b> <b>allocations</b> possible. As a measure of sensitivity, the problem is solved using different weight structures specified by the decision maker. A case study is provided to illustrate the usefulness of the method...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the common sources of etiologies of {{conflict}} in multicultural contexts. Multicultural communication is the creation and sharing of meaning among citizens of the same geopolitical system who belong to divergent tributary cultures. The sources of conflict in multicultural relations can be grouped into five broad categories. These include: (1) the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> resources; (2) historical legacy; (3) attitudinal interference; (4) lack of cultural literacy; and (5) variations among people. Of the five categories, the greatest source of conflict is the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> resources, whether human, natural, or institutional. Conflicts usually occur due {{to a combination of}} these sources. The probability of solving multicultural conflicts is greatly increased when the communicators are aware of the contributing factors. An appendix contains a statistical analysis <b>of</b> the <b>Tolerance</b> for Huma...|$|R
