5|$|Though Patton had ambitions {{to enact}} {{education}} reform {{early in his}} administration, his financial adviser, James R. Ramsey, convinced him to propose a conservative budget in the first legislative session. The two developed a plan to modernize the state government, making it more efficient. State employees were leery of increased efficiency, believing it was <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>word</b> for cutting state jobs. Patton dispelled this notion by promising no involuntary layoffs. Patton also anticipated difficulty persuading legislators to invest an estimated $100million in equipment and processes to realize improved efficiency. However, when economists projected a budget surplus for 1996, Patton agreed to invest half of it in capital projects in exchange for using the other half for measures to improve government efficiency. Patton formed an Office for Technology and made improvements in the compatibility and interoperability of the state's computer systems that were recommended by his son, Chris. Investments of $23.3million yielded a return of $300million in state revenue. By the time Patton's efficiency program was fully implemented, the state was realizing an annual return of 75cents for every dollar initially invested.|$|E

25|$|Y-Gerät an {{automatic}} beam-tracking {{system and the}} most complex of the three devices, which was operated through the autopilot. The pilot flew along an approach beam, monitored by a ground controller. Signals from the station were retransmitted by the bomber's equipment, which allowed the distance the bomber had travelled along the beam to precisely be measured. Direction-finding checks also enabled the controller to keep the pilot on course. The crew would be ordered to drop their bombs either by <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>word</b> from the ground controller or {{at the conclusion of}} the signal transmissions which would stop. The maximum range of Y-Gerät was similar to the other systems and it was accurate enough on occasion for specific buildings to be hit.|$|E

Evading the police, Langdon and Sophie travel to the Depository Bank of Zurich, discovering a safe deposit box of Saunière's that is accessed using the Fibonacci sequence. Inside is a cryptex, a cylindrical container that hides a papyrus message which can only be accessed by spelling out <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>word</b> using dials. The police arrive and Langdon and Sophie are aided by the bank manager, Andre Vernet, only for him to take them hostage {{in the back of a}} truck, and hold them at gunpoint demanding the cryptex. Langdon disarms Vernet and flees with Sophie and the cryptex.|$|E

The film's expected run-time was fifteen minutes and was billed by the Thanhouser Company as having many novelties and being of a comedic nature. It was released on March 7, 1911 and listed as a drama by the Moving Picture World. It was distributed by the Motion Picture Distributing and Sales Company. The production came {{during a time of}} renewed interest in Egyptology in which Pathé and Urban Films would release their own films titled The Mummy. This would be followed by Essanay Studios in 1912 with the release of When Soul Meets Soul and Gaumont Film Company The Vengeance of Egypt.

500|$|To {{guard against}} leaks that had prefigured Spock's death during {{production}} of The Wrath of Khan, [...] Paramount took precautions {{to secure the}} sets. Set designer Cameron Birnie noted that the production's security was highly unusual; sets were built out of sequence and the crew given only as many pages as they needed to fabricate each locale. Security guards checked the picture identification cards of production staff. Any mention of the production was removed from stationery and documents, and [...] "Trois" [...] (three, in French) was written as <b>a</b> <b>code</b> <b>word.</b> Offices and workshops were bereft of identifying signage, with doors double-locked for extra protection. The Search for Spocks scripts were chemically treated so that copies could {{be traced to the}} original; as a further canary trap, subtle changes in wording distinguished each copy. Nimoy's name never appeared on call sheets, and Spock was referred to in the script as [...] "Nacluv" [...] (Vulcan spelled backwards). Despite the precautions, word of the Enterprises destruction leaked out before the film's release.|$|E

The group of reversible words is so designed that for each information word in the region, <b>an</b> individual reversible <b>code</b> <b>word</b> is available.
