5|$|The {{process was}} {{abruptly}} halted by the <b>automatic</b> <b>control</b> rod reinserting itself, {{due to its}} trip level being set too low. At 11:25, Fermi ordered the control rods reinserted. He then {{announced that it was}} lunch time.|$|E
5|$|The concept behind {{diffused}} lighting camouflage was to project light {{on to the}} sides of a ship so as to make its brightness match its background. For this purpose, projectors were mounted on temporary supports attached to the hull. The prototype was developed to include <b>automatic</b> <b>control</b> of brightness using a photocell. The prototyped concept was never put into production, though the Canadian prototypes did briefly see active service. The Canadian ideas were, however, adapted by the US Air Force in its Yehudi lights project.|$|E

5|$|By 1955 the {{original}} sound negatives began to deteriorate, though a four-track copy had survived in good condition. Using the remaining Fantasound {{system at the}} studio, a three-track stereo copy was transferred across telephone wires onto magnetic film at an RCA facility in Hollywood. This copy was used when Fantasia was reissued in stereo by Buena Vista Distribution in SuperScope, a derivative of the anamorphic widescreen CinemaScope format, on February 7, 1956. The projector featured an <b>automatic</b> <b>control</b> mechanism designed by Disney engineers that was coupled to a variable anamorphic lens, which allowed the picture to switch between its Academy standard aspect ratio of 1.33:1 to the wide ratio of 2.35:1 in twenty seconds without {{a break in the}} film. This was achieved by placing the cues that controlled the mechanism on a separate track in addition to the three audio channels. Only selected parts of the animation were stretched, while all live action scenes remained unchanged. This reissue garnered some criticism from viewers, as the widescreen format led to the cropping and reframing of the images.|$|E
5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and <b>automatic</b> <b>control</b> from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E

40|$|We {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the effects of}} <b>automatic</b> speed <b>control</b> and expertise on train driver performance in unexpected, non-routine situations in the railway domain. Research from other domains suggested increasing levels of automation to exert detrimental effects on non- routine performance. In addition, research {{about the role of}} expertise in different levels of railway automation is scarce. We assessed the reaction times of 26 train drivers to critical non-routine events in a high fidelity railway simulator featuring manual and <b>automatic</b> speed <b>control.</b> We reported longer reaction times to non-routine situations under <b>automatic</b> speed <b>control.</b> Based on occupational experience data we found more experienced train drivers to adapt their reliance on automation more accurately to the automation reliability level resulting in an interaction trend in terms of non- routine performance.
