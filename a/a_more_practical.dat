5|$|Although Koniecpolski had a stutter, {{when he was}} 15, {{through his}} father's {{influence}} in the royal court, he secured an appointment as starosta (mayor) of Wieluń.

5|$|Germany has an {{installed}} capacity {{of wind and}} solar that can exceed daily demand, and has been exporting peak power to neighboring countries, with exports which amounted to some 14.7 billion kWh in 2012. <b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>practical</b> solution is the installation of thirty days storage capacity able to supply 80% of demand, which will become necessary when most of Europe's energy is obtained from wind power and solar power.

5|$|On <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>practical</b> level, {{the central}} {{government}} took an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was the top priority of land use. Larger farms (latifundia) achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life and its more specialized division of labour. Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as peas and cabbage to Britain.|$|E

5|$|In {{view of the}} board's lack of urgency, C {{took nearly}} a year to {{research}} this project. The proposed main battery of eight 14-inch guns was kept constant while other factors were calculated—speeds of 26, 29 and 32 knots; operating ranges of 5000, 7000 and 8000 miles; and belt armor of 8, 11 and 14 inches. On 12 July 1912, Naval Constructor R.H. Robinson presented these studies at a lecture he gave at the Naval War College with the General Board in attendance. There, he emphasized 8 inches as an absolute minimum for armor protection and recommended a radius of 8000 miles, {{the same as in}} U.S. battleships. The General Board's reaction was to request two battlecruisers for the 1914 Naval Building Program and ask C for a slightly modified version of the proposed ship, but the Naval War College felt the design had serious problems and that a fast battleship would be <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>practical</b> option.|$|E
