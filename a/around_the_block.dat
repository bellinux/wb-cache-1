5|$|A {{new line}} to Rodeløkka was opened on 3 January 1955. The bus {{operation}} {{had been more}} expensive than the tram, and a double track line was built from Carl Berners plass through Dælenenggata to Rodeløkka. The balloon loop was built <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> of Dælenengata, Fagerheimgata, Marstrandgata and Københavngata. The line was connected to the old Rodeløkka Line with a triangular loop in Københavngata. On 23 April 1961, all traffic on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated. The tracks were removed between 1962 and 1964.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, Cameron was {{focusing}} to {{a greater}} extent on her family life, particularly in looking after her grandchildren, who were known to go joyriding in her jeep. Neighbors recall her playing a Celtic harp in her garden and slowly walking her dog <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> while smoking a joint of marijuana. At one point, she was arrested for cultivating cannabis in her home. Cameron became a regular practitioner of Tai chi, took part in group sessions in Bronson Park under the tutelage of Marshall Ho'o, and earned a teaching certificate in the subject. She became very interested in José Argüelles' The Mayan Factor and Charles Musès' The Lion Path, and undertook the Neo-shamanic practices endorsed in the latter. She was also influenced by claims made in the writings of archaeologist Marija Gimbutas about a prehistoric matriarchal society devoted to a goddess. Cameron was very interested in A. S. Raleigh's Woman and Superwoman, taped her own reading of it, and sent copies to her friends and local public radio for broadcast. Throughout all of these disparate spiritual interests, she retained faith in the Thelemic ideas of Crowley.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, a new 3-litre formula {{was created}} for Formula One. The new engines under {{development}} by other suppliers all had at least 12 cylinders and proved difficult to develop, being heavy and unreliable. Brabham took {{a different approach to}} the problem of obtaining a suitable engine: he persuaded Australian engineering company Repco to develop a new 3-litre eight-cylinder engine for him. Repco had no experience in designing complete engines. Brabham had identified a supply of suitable engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine and persuaded the company that an engine could be designed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> largely using existing components. Brabham and Repco were aware that the engine would not compete in terms of outright power, but felt that a lightweight, reliable engine could achieve good championship results while other teams were still making their new designs reliable.|$|E

2500|$|Machines with {{continuous}} blocks {{differ from}} single block machines {{by having a}} series of dies through which the wire is drawn in a continuous fashion.

25|$|The rising {{popularity}} of The Honeymooners {{was reflected in}} its increasing prominence of the sketches as part of The Jackie Gleason Show variety lineup. During the first season, it appeared {{on a regular basis}} (although not weekly) as a series of short sketches ranging in length from seven to thirteen minutes. For the 1953–54 season, the shorter sketches were outnumbered by ones that ran for a half-hour or longer. Playing off its growing popularity, during the 1954–55 season most episodes of The Jackie Gleason Show consisted entirely of The Honeymooners. Fan response became overwhelming. Meadows received hundreds of curtains and aprons in the mail from fans who wanted to help Alice lead a fancier life. By January 1955, The Jackie Gleason Show was competing with—and sometimes beating—I Love Lucy as the most-watched TV show in the United States. Audience members lined up <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> hours in advance to attend the show.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Nevins, Chief Engineer of the Brooklyn Fire Department, {{arrived at}} the theatre around 11:26pm; he decided {{immediately}} that the building was lost and his job was one of confinement. Dieter Hotel, {{on the corner of}} Washington and Johnson streets, was lower than the theatre, its broad flat roof was an inviting target for flaming debris. The First Police Precinct station house, south of the theatre, was an old brick building with dry wooden support beams. Ramshackle wooden frame buildings stretched down the block on Flood's Alley opposite the burning theatre. At that point, the prevailing wind was from the west, carrying smoke and cinders east, dropping firebrands onto these old structures. The Post Office, south of the police station house, was filled with paper mail. Nevins had called {{in the second and third}} alarms while on the way to the fire; when the additional equipment arrived, he deployed the engines <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> to keep adjoining buildings free of sparks and burning debris.|$|E
500|$|Production {{proceeded}} {{with virtually no}} input or interference from Universal. American Graffiti was a low-budget film, and executive Ned Tanen had only modest expectations of its commercial success. However, Universal did object to the film's title, not knowing what [...] "American Graffiti" [...] meant; Lucas was dismayed when some executives assumed he was making an Italian movie about feet. The studio therefore submitted {{a long list of}} over 60 alternative titles, with their favorite being Another Slow Night in Modesto and Coppola's Rock <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Block.</b> They pushed hard to get Lucas to adopt any of the titles, but he was displeased with all the alternatives and persuaded Tanen to keep American Graffiti.|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} {{studies have}} both depicted {{the distribution of}} mass flow around an array of rectangular blocks due to buoyancy driven flows. The geometric configuration (array of rectangular blocks in-line arranged) simulates the cross-section of a disc-type transformer. It is a two-dimensional model. Transversal flows through horizontal channels (space between blocks) have been observed on an experimental set-up. Laser Doppler velocimeter is {{used to measure the}} velocity field. Numerical simulations of the flow in the same configuration have proved the influence of buoyancy forces, the pitch ratio and the asymmetric heating on the distribution of mass flow rate <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>blocks.</b> To have a better insight of this phenomenon, a physical model characterised by half heated blocks in-line arranged with alternating asymmetry of heat dissipation per <b>block</b> in <b>the</b> stream wise direction is used. It is meant to point out the conjugate effect of asymmetric heating and <b>block</b> spacing on <b>the</b> mass flow distribution <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>blocks.</b> <b>The</b> model establishes conditions to allow transversal flow and a correlation between the Rayleigh number and the maximum mass flow rate through horizontal channel. It is also possible to modify deliberately the heat dissipation rate asymmetry to get all the fluid streams through horizontal channels and this without any block-washers to direct the flow. A configuration is proposed to apply to power transformers. In short this study brings a major solution – cheap and non-intrusive (without physical bodies) – to the cooling of horizontal channels in a configuration featuring rectangular blocks in-line arranged. rstatus: publishe...|$|R
