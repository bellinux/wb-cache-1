5|$|As for the {{development}} of the parochial system, David's traditional role as its creator can not be sustained. Scotland already had an ancient system of parish churches dating to the Early Middle Ages, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of system introduced by David's Normanising tendencies can more accurately be seen as mild refashioning, rather than creation; he made the Scottish system as a whole more like that of France and England, but he did not create it.|$|E
5|$|I’d {{like them}} to walk away {{thinking}} it’s a film that can be interpreted {{in more than one}} way. I’m happy when I hear from people who’ve seen the short that it makes them think about the kind of strangeness where we find inspiration for art and where we find love, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of miraculousness of just being alive and having a life. I’m pleased when people get that out of it.|$|E

His pamphlet A Letter to the Clergy on the Two-penny Act was printed in 1760, as he opposed increasing pay and the creation of a bishop for the colonies.|$|E
25|$|The North-Tower, {{which had}} survived a ruin after 1815, only assumed {{importance}} for Himmler {{starting in the}} autumn of 1935. In the process of Himmler establishing the castle as a cult site (an ideological and religious center of the SS), the tower was to serve the highest-ranking SS leaders as a meeting place and probably as location for quasi-religious devotions. Nothing is known about the possible way <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of arrangement of designated ceremonies in the towerthe redesigned rooms were never used.|$|E

Whereas the upper surface of the board is smooth, the stomp pad has a textured pattern which provides grip to {{the underside of the}} boot.

And later, {{his contributions}} to the first two volumes, 1784–1785, of the transactions of the Turin Academy; to the first of which he contributed a paper on the pressure exerted by fluids in motion, and to the second an article on integration by infinite series, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of problems for which it is suitable.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate {{has been}} {{prepared}} as a drink {{for nearly all}} of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate's preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BCE. On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cacao beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BCE. The residues <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of vessel {{in which they were}} found indicate the initial use of cacao was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cacao beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.|$|E
25|$|Some {{consider}} that singing {{is not a}} natural process but is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes, but others {{consider that}} some ways of singing {{can be considered as}} natural. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Voice teachers instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.|$|E

25|$|Incidents {{of police}} {{brutality}} seem to still be occurring at a consistent rate, however it {{is yet to be}} seen whether the trial of body cameras will make a difference to the number of incidents occurring or to the number of police who are prosecuted for misconduct. Additionally, there needs to be more work done by the government to break down negative social stereotypes that can lead to prejudice, racial profiling <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of aggressive hatred which is the driving force behind many instances {{of police brutality}} - the involvement of NGOs is valuable however the Austrian government needs to take a strong stance against abuse of power by police in order for real change to happen. One way to do this, as suggested by Amnesty International Austria, would be to disband the Bereitschaftspolizei, Vienna's riot police, as these officers have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations of police brutality. Amnesty also suggest that Austria should adopt a National Action Plan against Racism (as is required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action) - something which they have previously refused to do. On a whole, Austria is moving slowly towards eradicating police brutality, however there needs to be much more done in order to ensure the rights of citizens are sufficiently protected.|$|E
