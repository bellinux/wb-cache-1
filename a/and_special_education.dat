40|$|This is a {{research}} paper that will discuss relations between universal design (UD) <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>special</b> needs <b>education</b> in the Japanese context. First, the definitions and terminology of UD are explained. In addition, UD education, UD for learning (UDL) and UD for instructions (UDI) are explained. Second, how UD was introduced into Japanese education is discussed. Third, the relationship between UD <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>special</b> needs <b>education</b> is approached. Japanese teachers may apply UD as to practice <b>special</b> needs <b>education.</b> However, UD means“ universal” and UD practice usually targets all children, while <b>special</b> needs <b>education</b> focuses more deeply upon an individual child. To ensure an understanding of these relations, survey results of teachers’ perceptions of UD education was included. The survey revealed that teachers were confused and unsure what UD was, or what the difference between UD <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>special</b> needs <b>education</b> was. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} figure out the concept of UD education. Although UD <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>special</b> needs <b>education</b> are not equal, the notion of UD may have much potential to improve <b>special</b> needs <b>education.</b> For examples, UD might provide better practices for students with high functioning developmental disabilities and it may also cover a gap between regular <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>special</b> needs <b>education.</b> To conclude, UD education may be useful as first intervention <b>and</b> <b>special</b> needs <b>education</b> may take the role of being effective additional support. ...|$|R
