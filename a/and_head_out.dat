5|$|While NY32 officially remains {{concurrent}} with NY299 {{all the way}} to {{the traffic}} light at the northern terminus of NY208, a sign at the Elting Memorial Library, just before the center of downtown, directs northbound traffic on the highway down North Front Street. This shortcut allows that traffic to skip an often busy intersection <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of the village on North Chestnut Street. Once past the village, the Ulster Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) building comes up on the west and the town hall along the east. NY32 then becomes mostly rural again.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully rent a boat <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> {{onto the}} lake; their boat is quickly struck by {{something}} and sinks. The two find a large rock {{to climb up}} on and talk for a while about Mulder's quest to catch Big Blue, and the book Moby-Dick. When Dr. Farraday walks by the two realize they were close to shore all along. Mulder thinks the drop in the frog supply has caused Big Blue to move closer to shore and seek alternative food sources. Farraday is soon attacked but manages {{to make it out}} alive. Mulder chases the attacker into the woods and fires at it, revealing it to be an alligator. Mulder is disappointed that the killer ended up being an alligator and not Big Blue. As the agents leave, Big Blue swims nearby in the lake, unnoticed.|$|E

25|$|Route74 was {{to begin}} at an {{interchange}} with Route18 {{in the community of}} East Brunswick (in Middlesex County). The route was to head eastward, crossing over CR527 (the Old Bridge Turnpike) just after its impetus. From there, the four-lane freeway was to enter the community of South River, where it would have an interchange with CR535 (Main Street). The route would dip to the south, cross over the South River and into Sayreville. There it would parallel CR535 (now known as Washington Road), and interchange with CR675 (Jernee's Mill Road) in the community. After an interchange with Minisink Avenue, Route74 was to turn to the southeast <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of Sayreville. Starting here, the area surrounding the freeway was to be improvised with major development.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon's first plan, {{put forward}} in May 1804 for {{execution}} between July and September envisaged the break-out from Toulon of 10 ships {{of the line}} and 11 frigates under Admiral Latouche Tréville. They would evade the patrolling British fleet under Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson and sail into the Atlantic, slipping past Alexander Cochrane's fleet off Ferrol and entering the Bay of Biscay. They would then make for Rochefort where they would be joined by another six ships of the line. While this was taking place Vice-Admiral Ganteaume would sail from Brest with 23 ships of the line <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> into the Atlantic, hopefully drawing the main British Channel Fleet under Admiral William Cornwallis after them. Latouche Tréville would then have a clear run into the Channel and up to Boulogne, where he would escort the invasion fleet safely across. The plan was complicated and depended on the unlikely events of favourable weather, the avoidance of Cochrane's and Nelson's fleets and the decoying away of Cornwallis. The plan was never put into operation. Latouche Tréville remained at Toulon rather than risk an encounter with Nelson, and died suddenly on 19 August, putting an end to the scheme.|$|E

Cox said, [...] "Everybody who does this for a living, dreams about being nominated. It's the ultimate accomplishment.

The game will track your movement and reduce the size and detail of the environments as you gain altitude. The reverse is true when you're approaching a planet and go to land--you'll find that detail seen from the air will scale in as you get closer.|$|E

2500|$|Bellowing: Male {{crocodiles}} {{are especially}} vociferous. Bellowing choruses occur {{most often in}} the spring when breeding groups congregate, but can occur {{at any time of}} year. To bellow, males noticeably inflate as they raise the tail <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of water, slowly waving the tail back and forth. They then puff out the throat and with a closed mouth, begin to vibrate air. Just before bellowing, males project an infrasonic signal at about 10Hz through the water, which vibrates the ground and nearby objects. These low-frequency vibrations travel great distances through both air and water to advertise the male's presence and are so powerful they result in the water's appearing to [...] "dance".|$|E
2500|$|Polyergus {{workers will}} emerge from their nest (a mixed nest where Formica workers are already enslaved) and forage for a {{suitable}} raid target. If one is found, the scouts {{will return to}} the nest, rally the other Polyergus, <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> in a raiding column. If it was a Formica nest, the Polyergus incite a [...] "panic-flee" [...] response from the Formica by releasing formic acid and take the Formica pupae back to their nest to be slaves. Occasionally, a new queen will embark on a raiding column with the other Polyergus. She will then, after mating, leave the column and forage for a suitable Formica nest. Howard Topoff did a considerable amount of work in evaluating how the queen then takes over the colony. After finding a Formica nest, she finds an entrance and is immediately attacked by Formica worker. The queen responds by biting with her sharp mandibles and releasing a pheromone from her enlarged Dufour's gland that, unlike many other parasitic ants, has a pacifying effect. The queen quickly searches for and locates the Formica queen and, with her adapted mandibles, proceeds to bite and lick various parts the Formica queen for an average of 25 minutes. [...] "Within seconds of the host queens death, the nest undergoes a most remarkable transformation". The Formica workers cease to be aggressive to the intruder and start to groom the Polyergus queen as if it were their own. The takeover now complete, the Polyergus queen gains not only a nest, but a worker caste as well. She then lays her eggs and the cycle continues.|$|E
