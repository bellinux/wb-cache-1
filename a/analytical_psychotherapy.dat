40|$|Background: With the {{publication}} of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Third Edition (DSM-III) in 1980, anxiety disorder was first identified as a diagnostic entity. A new theoretical approach regarding aetiology of anxiety disorders came next into the view, far from Freud’s psychoanalytical pathways. The consequences were new therapeutic guidelines, including psychopharmacotherapy and the use of behavioural and cognitive psychotherapy. Methods: The paper presents a case report study of a patient with social phobia. The use of <b>analytical</b> oriented <b>psychotherapy,</b> which helped to resolve Axis I symptoms, is described. Conclusions: In spite of new therapeutic guidelines there is still a certain population of patients with the need for psychoanalytical oriented psychotherapy. If we are to surrender the Freud’s legacy to the medical history, we will weaken psychiatry as a science and will narrow our therapeutic field. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhat is the {{specificity}} of supervision in analytical psychology, especially when working on deep levels of the psyche? A large variety of experiences are associated, experiences that are not common for the usual control of our thoughts and actions, but they are characteristically for {{a state of mind}} in which unconscious is activated with the free play of fantasy expressing the inside human nature. Using sandplay we succeed to touch profound aspects concerning counter-transference, the relation between therapist and patient, and the pre-verbal affective systems. For argumentation we are using the affective neurology and the <b>analytical</b> approach in <b>psychotherapy...</b>|$|R

Poor prognostic factors included firstly the existence of personality disorders, a minimum weight lower than 30 kg, and secondly depressive episodes. On the average, more than 3 forms of therapy were administered to each patient in our clinic. Cognitive-behavioral therapy was highly effective in general. There {{was no difference in}} efficacy between strict cognitive-behavioral therapy and lenient cognitive-behavioral therapy. Supportive or <b>analytical</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> was very useful in the treatment of binge-eating/purging type of anorexia nervosa, and cognitive therapy was useful in the treatment of bulimia nervosa.

40|$|Kernberg related {{personality}} disorders to early defence mechanisms against sexual and aggressive drives and highlighted {{the role played}} by the dysfunctions in object relations, established during early infancy. It is in childhood when the patient sets in motion pathological defence mechanism (dissociation, acting out, projective identification etc.). Later studies contend that most core symptoms of the disorder, such as: a diffuse sense of self, bursts of rage, unstable interpersonal relationships, feelings of emptiness and abandonment, chronic fears of, and an intolerance for aloneness, have their roots in an impaired organization of the underlying attachment (in Bowlby's sense). Levy et al underline that individual differences in the attachments of adult people are rooted in the early patterns of interaction with caregivers and the completion of a number of attachment measures, revealed six factors that clustered into three groups (an avoidant attachment pattern, a preoccupied attachment pattern, and a fearfully preoccupied pattern). These patients are difficult to manage in individual <b>analytical</b> <b>psychotherapy,</b> due to their instability, which is frequently related to a loss of self-esteem and identity confusion. The course of therapy tends to be disturbed by intense transferences and various acts, such a...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the subject}} of dreaming {{and the use of}} client dream reports has been largely ignored by {{behavior}} therapists, this remains a topic which merits some investigation. This paper focuses on the clinical utility of client dream reports when doing a contemporary, behavior analytically-based ther-apy, Functional <b>Analytical</b> <b>Psychotherapy</b> (FAP). After briefly discussing FAP, I propose that client dream reports: (1) provide the therapist with further access to a client’s reinforcement history which can assist with supporting or modifying treatment goals; and (2) consistent with a FAP approach, dream reports can provide the therapist with opportunities to focus on client behavior relevant to treatment goals that occurs in-session in order to effect change. I close with a comment on the role of interpretation of dreams from a FAP perspective. Dreaming is a topic that remains largely ignored by radi-cal behaviorists. How dreams come to exist as verbal events might be understood using an analysis similar to Skinner’s (1945) examination of private events. It is possible to out-line the potential reinforcement histories that may give rise to a person talking about dreams when the verbal commu...|$|E
40|$|Social {{relationships}} and communities provide the context and impetus {{for a range}} of psychological developments, from genetic expression to the development of core self-identities. This suggests a need to think about the therapeutic changes and processes that occur within a community context and how communities can enable therapeutic change. However, the ‘therapeutic communities ’ that have developed since the Second World War have been under-researched. We suggest that the concept of community, as a change process, should be revisited within mainstream scientific research. This paper briefly reviews the historical development of therapeutic communities and critically evaluates their current theory, practice and outcomes in a systematic review. Attention is drawn to recent research on the nature of evolved emotion regulation systems, the way these are entrained by social relationships, the importance of affiliative emotions in the regulation of threat and the role of fear of affiliative emotions in psychopathol-ogy. We draw on concepts from compassion-focussed therapy, social learning theory and functional <b>analytical</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> to consider how members of a therapeutic community can be aware of each other’s acts of courage and respond using compassion. Living in structured and affiliative-orientated communities that are guided by scientific models of affect and self-regulation offers potential therapeutic advantages over individual outpatient therapy for certain client groups. This conclusion should b...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProblem statement: Trans-generational traumas {{are deep}} hidden {{enduring}} issues difficult to handle in current psychotherapy approaches using awareness techniques. Research questions: What approaches can separate personal experiences from epigenetic issues {{and how can}} be identified trans-generational trauma? Are symbol formation & transcendent function useful approaches in order to separate personal experiences from epigenetic issues? Purpose of the study: The study aims to explore the appearance during the <b>analytical</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> of symbolic materials pointing to consequences of psychological wounds of the grandparents upon next generations. Assisting the patient to find his/her own identity needs {{to find ways to}} work on separation and differentiation from ancestors’ anxieties, and PTSD. Methods: Qualitative analysis was used to connect dreams and other symbolic expressions of patient psychic condition with family memories and legends of life events of previous generations to identify the root-source. We used analytical methods as active imagination and creative conjunctio as the carriers of transformation to enhance conscious separation and personal identity Findings and results: The traumatic life events of a grandparent can mould the psychic life approach of the following generations. The analytical can provide ways to intervene and help the person to find his true identity. Conclusions: The psyche can be the carrier of parental psychic heritage as the dramas in previous generations affect the mental health and the way the second and third generation react to life events. The offspring are carrying an epigenetic change as the same but more empowering anxiety is active in their lives. Psychotherapy can liberate the carriers, and redeem the ancestors...|$|E
40|$|Background. Generalized anxiety {{disorder}} {{is a common}} condition of excessive worry and tension which tends to run a chronic course associated with significant psychiatric and medical problems. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) {{has been shown to}} be of clinical value in about 50 %of cases with treatment gains maintained over follow-up periods ranging from 6 to 12 months. The potential value of CBT over the longer term has not been subject to rigorous investigation. Method. Results are reported of 8 – 14 year follow-up of two randomized controlled trials of cognitive-behaviour therapy for generalized {{anxiety disorder}} employing structured interview with an assessor blind to initial treatment condition. Comparison groups included medication and placebo in one study based in primary care, and <b>analytical</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> in the other based in secondary care. Follow-up samples (30 % and 55 % of trial entrants) were broadly representative of the original cohorts. Results. Overall, 50 % of participants were markedly improved of whom 30 – 40 % were recovered (i. e. free of symptoms). Outcome was significantly worse for the study based in secondary care in which the clinical presentation of participants was more complex and severe. For a minority (30 – 40 %), mainly from the secondary care study, outcome was poor. Treatment with CBT was associated with significantly lower overall severity of symptomatology and less interim treatment, in comparison with non-CBT conditions, but there was no evidence that CBT influenced diagnostic status, probability of recovery or patient perceptions of overall improvement. Conclusions. Both CBT and the complexity and severity of presenting problems appear to influence the long-term outcome of GAD...|$|E
40|$|Este estudo tem o objetivo de {{investigar}} o conceito de cura d’alma na psicologia de Carl Gustav Jung, colocando em evidência os aspectos religiosos presentes no processo de cura, compreendidos pelo autor como Individuação. Organizada em três capítulos, a dissertação começa por apresentar o conceito alma, que nas obras do autor aparece hora como psique, hora como personalidade, complexo, consciência e individualidade, demonstrando uma complexa rede de significados. No capítulo seguinte, o conceito cura é investigado a luz da psicoterapia analítica, colocando em evidência a necessidade de um relacionamento com o inconsciente, de modo a proporcionar um desenvolvimento psicológico. A individuação como um processo de diferenciação do ego, conduz a realização do si-mesmo, o centro da psique e a totalidade da personalidade. No terceiro e último capítulo, o termo cura d’alma é analisado em paralelo com o conceito de religião, compreendido no pensamento de Jung como relegere, que diz respeito a um cuidado ou zelo ao lidar com os aspectos numinosos e transcendentes da psique. Por este viés, que a individuação pode ser compreendida em sua vertente também religiosa, denotando a presença de uma cura d’alma na psicologia de Jung. This study aims {{to investigate}} the concept cure of the soul according to the psychology of Carl Gustav Jung, highlighting the religious aspects in the cure process, understood by the author as individuation. Organized into three chapters, the dissertation begins by presenting {{the concept of the}} soul, that, based on the author’s works, appears both as the psyche or as personality, complex, consciousness and individuality, showing an intricate network of meanings. On the next chapter, the concept of cure is investigated within the context of <b>analytical</b> <b>psychotherapy,</b> highlighting the need for a relationship with the unconscious, to provide a psychological development. The individuation as a process of differentiation of the self, leads to the realization of the self, the center of the psyche and the totality of the personality. On the third and final chapter, the term cure of the soul is examined in parallel with the definition of religion, understood in Jung's thoughts as relegere, which relates to care or diligence when dealing with numinous and transcendent aspects of the psyche. By this point of view individuation can be understood also in its religious aspect, denoting the presence of a cure of the soul in Jungian psychology...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of the Study: I {{propose that}} equine-facilitated {{psychotherapy}} (EFP) can {{provide support for}} the emotional needs of adolescent {{students with learning disabilities}} and that {{it has the potential to}} be funded by a granting organization. This project investigates the various methods of therapy which utilize interaction with horses. These include hippotherapy, therapeutic riding, vaulting, and EFP. It also describes a method by which an EFP grant project can be developed and potentially funded. Procedure: A survey of local school personnel was conducted to determine perceived areas of student need. An investigation into the methodology of equine therapies was conducted through a review of literature and conversations with an equine therapist. A determination was made of the availability of grants which could potentially fund an EFP program. A local nonprofit agency was contacted and a cooperative arrangement established whereby development and implementation of an EFP program to support students with learning disabilities could achieve fruition. Findings: School personnel indicated social skills and counseling to address self-esteem issues were the greatest needs among the students at their school. A review of the literature indicated that the use of horses in therapy provides additional benefit to therapeutic experiences because horses can be ridden, act as emotional mirrors, and provide immediate feedback. The effectiveness of EFP may be substantiated by describing the ways in which it relates to established areas and methods of treatment such as psychodrama, Gestalt therapy, play therapy, and <b>analytical</b> <b>psychotherapy.</b> EFP is an emerging field of treatment in need of further research. Preliminary studies show its potential to improve psychosocial functioning in at-risk adolescents, children exposed to intrafamily violence, and adults. The local nonprofit agency agreed to work with me and to be responsible for implementation of the grant offered by a small community-based granting agency. The grant proposal to provide funding for EFP for adolescents with learning disabilities was drafted using a previous year's funding criteria; the draft might require modification when the current year's funding criteria are made available. Conclusions: A limited number of studies of EFP have been conducted; the scarcity of documentation on the efficacy of this treatment makes it difficult to determine trends. Further research, which the funding of this grant would provide, needs to be conducted. Establishment and development of a relationship with a nonprofit agency without a liaison is challenging but achievable. A grant for this form of therapy does have the potential to be funded. Information derived from the program could benefit the scholarly community, educators, and therapists, while the therapy available through the program could benefit the children and families it is targeted to support...|$|E
