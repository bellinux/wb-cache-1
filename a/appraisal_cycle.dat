The existing cognitive appraisal mechanism is adapted to produce a second <b>appraisal</b> <b>cycle,</b> a double appraisal, in order to evaluate the emotional impact of possible actions. The action with the greatest emotional impact is selected {{as a means of}} producing more interesting dramatic actions. A variant in which the actual minds of characters present are used is also implemented and evaluated. Results show that these mechanisms do produce more interesting stories...|$|E
40|$|Written {{over two}} decades ago, The One-Minute Manager is still a top-selling book. 1 In just over 100 pages, it exudes advice to {{managers}} on short (one-minute) techniques for achieving a positive result with their employees, improving their productivity and job satisfaction. The authors explain how communication and consistency can improve results with minimal time and effort. In its own way, the Extreme Programming methodology exudes this same advice: Be communicative with everyone on the team—including customers, end users, and business folks. Consistently and doggedly strive to understand and deliver what your customers want with the highest possible quality. Frequently offer feedback—a one-minute manager would never hold back until a formal <b>appraisal</b> <b>cycle</b> to give feedbac...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores {{employee}} {{responses to}} the performance-based pay schemes introduced into the Australian Public service in 1998 and 1999. Many federal public sector employees {{were aware of the}} subjectivity and enhanced managerial discretion inherent in these schemes. In response, employees sought to ensure that performance indicators were specific and job-related. Employees were also {{aware of the importance of}} seeking regular feedback during the <b>appraisal</b> <b>cycle.</b> Nevertheless, the prime challenge for Australian public sector employees and their unions involved the development of an approach to performance management that would ameliorate the individualistic and competitive nature of individualised merit pay compensation processes. In particular, this involved the pursuit of increased procedural justice in the formulation and implementation of such schemes...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a 2 -year longitudinal study that examines the stance taken by a group of Western Australian teachers to the introduction of compulsory performance management in 1997. It shows that {{during the first year of}} implementation (1997), teachers responded to the new programme with significant levels of scepticism, mistrust and anxiety. By the second year (1998), despite continued reservations, the teachers found they could take charge of the process, maintain a sense of autonomy and control over their work, and capitalise on the limited opportunities for professional growth provided by annual <b>appraisal</b> <b>cycles.</b> A concluding theme emerging from the teachers' reported experiences and reflections is that management-inspired programmes of performance review have little impact on authentic teacher learning compared with active teacher participation in strong, accountable professional learning communities developed within and across schools...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Effective performance management systems link individual performance to organizational goals. In October 2000, the Office of Personnel Management amended regulations to require agencies to link senior executive performance with organizational goals; to appraise executive performance by balancing organizational results with customer satisfaction, employee perspective, and other areas; and to use performance results {{as a basis for}} pay, awards, and other personnel decisions. Agencies were to establish these performance management systems by their 2001 senior executive performance <b>appraisal</b> <b>cycles.</b> Because they implemented a set of balanced expectations prior to the Office of Personnel Management requirement, GAO studied the Bureau of Land Management's, Federal Highway Administration's, Internal Revenue Service's, and Veterans Benefits Administration's use of balanced expectations to manage senior executive performance in order to identify initial approaches that may be helpful to other agencies in holding senior executives accountable for results. ...|$|R

40|$|Master of EducationThis thesis {{presents}} a naturalistic descriptive case-study approach to an appraisal of Heads of Departments {{in a medium}} sized boys school in the inner South- Eastern suburbs of Melbourne. The language of 'tension' and 'paradox' is used to explore some of the built in contradictions which seemed to characterise this <b>appraisal</b> <b>cycle.</b> Its intention is to make explicit several 'tensions' which arose during the process: tensions between {{the intentions of the}} administrative leadership in the school and the participants in the appraisal, between the intended and actual outcomes, and between the nature of the appraisal itself and how this was perceived to relate to the daily work of those appraised. The process of the appraisal is described, as is its context and history in the school. Particular attention is given to ambiguities in the perceptions of key actors in the appraisal, which it is claimed were often unperceived or unstated. The experience of certain individuals is followed in order to explore this dimension further. In this thesis I find that there were significant benefits from the process that was conducted, but that it was also flawed in focussing almost exclusively on the administrative dimension of Department leadership, and also caused pain and discomfort to several of the people involved. The emotional dimension of appraisal is thus also considered. While many of the tensions discussed are seen as inherent in the process, changes in the process are suggested to make it more relevant to this particular group when an appraisal is run at the school again.

40|$|Two current {{pressing}} global challenges, {{climate change}} due to anthropogenic carbon emissions and poverty, are inextricably intertwined. In Australia these two issues are particularly pertinent. The nation {{is one of}} the highest per capita carbon emitters in the world, and despite being one of the most developed, the socio-economic disadvantage of its Indigenous peoples continues. This thesis provides a contribution to the dual fields of resilient and sustainable community development and climate change mitigation, with a sub-focus on asset-based assessment models for enabling community-directed low-carbon development in remote Indigenous communities. The remaining socio-economic disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians has revealed a need for an alternative approach to the past policy incrementalism that focuses on issues and needs, and improved engagement with remote communities. Therefore, an asset-based model, the Resilient Community and Livelihood Asset Integration Model (ReCLAIM), with a focus on aspirations and a continuous participatory <b>appraisal</b> <b>cycle</b> was developed for application with a community Advisory Committee. The six-step decision support model was applied, via a series of workshops, with two remote Indigenous communities to assist their selection of goal-oriented carbon management strategies. The application of the model identified the existing and aspirational assets of the communities, their current carbon emission profiles, the carbon management strategies they preferred for their settlement areas, the modelled outcomes and implementation plans. The carbon profiles and strategies selected differed between the two communities highlighting the need for a community-directed approach to understanding the drivers of carbon emissions, removals and mitigation responses. Economic benefits were highlighted with expected cost savings to communities and service providers. The model could be adapted to a variety of contexts including urban municipalities or remote villages in developing countries...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to explore ways of enhancing the overall lifetime quality, including cost and environmental efficiency, of Swedish concrete multi-dwelling buildings. The building and its characteristics, {{as well as the}} procedures for whole life optimisation, are addressed. The methods developed are general for buildings, while the application is specific. The fundamental characteristics (attributes) of dwelling buildings are reviewed, and a set of design criteria relating to these is compiled. Furthermore, the properties of concrete with regard to the attributes are analysed. The concept of Integrated Life Cycle Design is applied as methodological platform. By integrated life cycle design the traditional design procedure, is supplemented by life <b>cycle</b> <b>appraisal</b> and methods to optimise the building with regard to several more or less interacting parameters. A pilot toolbox for integrated life cycle design of residential buildings is developed and verified. This contains a set of design criteria addressing the fundamental attributes, modules for life cycle costing, energy balance calculation, structural and acoustic pre-design, environmental assessment and feed-back routines. The environmental assessment is based on a socio-economic cost estimation, relating to energy consumption during the user phase. Energy use for production and demolition are also taken into account, but only as average values. For the concrete building frame, a full LCA model, regarding the production phase is also developed. For the ranking of technical alternatives, in relation to the priorities of the client, ?Multiple Attribute Decision Analysis?, ?MADA?, was also included in the study and in the toolbox. The Integrated Life Cycle Design toolbox is tested and further developed by the application on eight real cases. A comparative desktop study on the resulting lifecycle consequences, from different functional quality levels is also undertaken. It was concluded that integrated life cycle design may enhance the lifetime quality and cost effectiveness of buildings and thus deserves introduction in practice. The life <b>cycle</b> <b>appraisal</b> tools and data are available and calculations can be done with reasonable effort, giving reliable results. The application examples show how integrated life cycle design can guide design decisions towards the optimal building with regard to specific priorities of the client...|$|R
40|$|Singapore {{is one of}} {{the most}} industrialised and urbanised economies in South-East Asia. Power supply is an {{important}} sub-system in its economy and heavily reliant on imported oil and natural gas. Due to its geographical area, clean/renewable energy sources for power generation are limited. At the same time, in its deregulated electricity market, the adoption of clean/renewable based power generation technology may be hindered by a market pricing mechanism that does not reflect externality costs. For a sustainable power supply, there is a need to change the conventional <b>appraisal</b> techniques. Life <b>cycle</b> assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) are good tools to quantify environmental impacts and economic implications. LCA and LCCA are performed for centralised and distributed power generation technologies in Singapore, namely, oil and Orimulsion-fired steam turbines, natural gas-fired combined cycle plant, solar PV and fuel cell systems. A life cycle energy, emission and cost inventory is established. The results are discussed from the perspectives of fuel security, environmental protection and cost effectiveness of future power generation strategies for Singapore.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new decision-support framework and software platform for an integrated assessment {{of options for}} sustainable management of urban pollution. The framework involves three steps: (1) mapping the flow of pollutants associated with human activities in the urban environment; (2) modelling the fate and transport of pollutants; and (3) quantifying the environmental, health and socio-economic impacts of urban pollution. It comprises a suite of different models and tools to support sustainability <b>appraisals</b> including life <b>cycle</b> assessment, substance flow analysis, source and pollutants characterisation, pollutant fate and transport modelling, health impact analysis, ecological impact assessment, and multi-criteria decision analysis. The framework can be used at different levels, from simple screening studies to more detailed assessments. The paper describes the decision-support framework and outlines several case studies to demonstrate its application. The software tool is available free of charge at www. pureframework. org. Practical applications: The PUrE framework and software platform {{can be applied to}} assess and compare the sustainability of different technologies, products, human activities or policies. Example applications of the framework have so far included sustainability comparisons of technologies for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste; generation of electricity from coal and biomass; environmental and health impacts of a mixture of pollutants in Sheffield; the role of urban green space in reducing the levels of particulate matter in London and the impacts of environmental policy on legacy pollution in Avenmouth...|$|R
40|$|Research from a {{range of}} {{countries}} revealed commonalities in how teachers perceived appraisal. It was common that teachers viewed appraisal negatively, and that appraisal was a process teachers completed because it was mandated to do so. In order to present a solution to the negativity that is often associated with appraisal, this study investigated teachers’ perceptions of the appraisal process in relation to the purpose of appraisal, the impact of appraisal on student learning outcomes and how appraisal can lead to improved teacher practice. The roles of communities of practice, reflective practice and the impact of leadership on the appraisal process were examined. The key component of effective appraisal was identified as being a quality relationship of teaching colleagues within a school. A school that incorporated improved student learning outcomes through improved teaching practice as a key objective of their appraisal process was examined in depth. This case study illustrated how an effective and purposeful appraisal process resulted in empowered teachers, which led to a positive impact on student outcomes. The overall findings of this study reveal that there are a set of conditions that need to be embedded into a school’s culture before appraisal can become meaningful. In order for a school to develop an effective appraisal strategy, these conditions must be inherent in the school culture. A four-step process for establishing the conditions is offered, followed by a suggested <b>cycle</b> of <b>appraisal.</b> However, the <b>cycle</b> would be ineffective if the conditions for effective appraisal were not embedded into the culture of the school first...|$|R
