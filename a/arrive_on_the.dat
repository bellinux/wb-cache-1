5|$|In the British Isles, the {{hooded crow}} breeds {{regularly}} in Scotland, the Isle of Man, and the Scottish Islands. It also breeds widely in Ireland. In autumn, some migratory birds <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{east coast of}} Britain. In the past, this was a more common visitor.|$|E
5|$|The Reichstag fire {{occurred}} {{on the night of}} 27 February 1933. Göring {{was one of the first}} to <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scene. Marinus van der Lubbe—a communist radical—was arrested and claimed sole responsibility for the fire. Göring immediately called for a crackdown on communists.|$|E
50|$|Two minutes later, {{the burning}} craft {{crashed into a}} sugar cane field west of Luxor. A second {{explosion}} was reported 15 seconds later. Ambulances <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scene after 15 minutes. Bodies were scattered across the field when rescue workers <b>arrived</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scene. The balloon's final moments were caught on amateur video.|$|R

5|$|A police {{van with}} two {{officers}} arrived {{a short time}} after the shootings began, at around 11:00. They entered the yard of the college where they were shot at by Saari, and forced to retreat. From around 11:45 to 12:00 further police units, bolstered {{by a number of}} armoured vehicles, began to <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scene. They attempted to enter the building through the main corridor, but this assault was aborted due to the black smoke that was emanating from within the building.|$|E
5|$|After a bad {{experience}} with genetically modified food, Marge decides to plant her own garden. Crows <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new garden, so Marge makes a scarecrow, which scares Homer. Homer destroys the scarecrow, and the crows see Homer as their leader, following him everywhere and doing his bidding. But when the crows try to carry Maggie, Homer turns on them and they attack his eyes. He is prescribed medicinal marijuana.|$|E
5|$|At around 1:30am {{the tide}} had risen {{enough to allow}} the LFEE's {{floating}} fire engine to <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scene. Braidwood had called for the engine five hours previously, but the low tide had hampered its progress from its downriver mooring at Rotherhithe. Once it arrived it was effective in bringing under control the fire that had taken hold in the Speaker's House.|$|E
25|$|On 6 January 1944, Marshall {{departed}} New York for Pearl Harbor, <b>arriving</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 28th. She {{remained at}} Pearl Harbor, undergoing further training and providing escort services to battle-damaged ships returning for repairs, until mid-March. Then, with Task Group 58.2 (TG58.2), she sailed for Majuro, <b>arriving</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 20th.|$|R

5|$|Cupid conceals himself, as Theseus and Ariadne <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island a short {{distance}} away. Ariadne muses over her disloyalty to her father, but declares her love for Theseus. She departs to find shelter for the night, after which a fishermen's chorus compares her eyes with the stars of heaven. Theseus, alone with his counsellor, discusses his abandonment of Ariadne, and is advised that this decision is justified, as {{she will not be}} acceptable to the people of Athens as their ruler's consort.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Trepkos <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scene. Mulder radios the {{evacuation}} team but—knowing that Trepkos will refuse to go—reports that only he and Scully {{have survived the}} ordeal. The agents enter a month-long quarantine while the Chemical Corps confiscates the lab and cordons off Mount Avalon. Firewalker is salvaged, but is too damaged to yield sufficient data. Trepkos and O'Neil are officially unaccounted for and presumed dead; Trepkos is last seen carrying O'Neil's body as he disappears into the volcano.|$|E
5|$|Of all the {{responsibilities}} given the two ships, {{the most important}} was to guard the Eastern Mediterranean against a breakout by Goeben, but when Goeben and Breslau finally made their breakout attempt on 20 January 1918, Lord Nelson was away at Salonika and Agamemnon could not get steam up to depart Mudros in time {{to participate in the}} resulting Battle of Imbros. After both German ships struck mines, Breslau sank and Goeben returned to the Dardanelles before Agamemnon could <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scene.|$|E

5|$|Several {{possible}} routes {{begin at}} Wythburn church. A bridleway winds up the fellside, over Comb Crags and traverses {{the slopes of}} Nethermost Pike to <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ridge at Swallow Scarth, the col just below Helvellyn. Other routes from Wythburn follow Comb Gill or Whelpside Gill, or Middle Tongue between these two gills. The shortest route of all follows the gill past the old lead mine, perhaps better used as a descent. Wainwright warned walkers with weak ankles to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|The first {{policeman}} to <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scene noticed wires {{running from}} the van's dashboard through a hole into the back and {{reported that he had}} found the bomb. Forensic experts later estimated that the bomb weighed 1,500–1,600 kg (3,300–3,500 lb) and was a mixture of semtex, a military-grade plastic explosive, and ammonium nitrate fertiliser, a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA. Components of what may have been a tremble trigger were also found later, designed to detonate the bomb if it was tampered with.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the planned extension, the two tracks {{continue}} east of this station for about 700 feet along 205th Street to Webster Avenue, ending at a concrete wall, and this station does not have any crew quarters. Crews are changed at Bedford Park Boulevard, the next station south. Additionally, there is no diamond crossover between the tracks west of this station; here, a center track forms leading west to the Concourse Yard. Because of this, terminating trains <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southern (railroad northbound) track and discharge their passengers before continuing east {{to the end of the}} track. They then use the diamond crossover there to return to this station on the northern (railroad southbound) track and begin service to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Due to the track configuration, trains may reverse into the yard from the southern track, and trains from the yard may start service on the northern track.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge's front {{regiment}} was the 10th Kentucky Mounted Rifles, {{under the}} command of Col. Benjamin Caudill. Caudill's men dismounted and fired into the Union cavalry, inflicting minor casualties. As the rest of Breckinridge's troops began to <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scene, Stoneman's soldiers secured elevated positions overlooking the river. Breckinridge observed that these hills were the best defensive positions in the area, ordering his front regiments to eliminate Union resistance on the hills. The rest of Giltner's Brigade also joined in the charge, routing the Union soldiers and allowing the Confederate forces to use the defensive positions themselves.|$|E
5|$|On 21 September 1917, the {{division}} arrived at Saint-Nazaire, France. It {{was the second}} division of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) to <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western Front at the time, and the first division wholly organized in the United States, joining the 1st Division. Two additional divisions completed {{the first wave of}} American troop deployment, with the 2nd Division formed in France and the 42nd Division arriving at St. Nazaire on 29 October. The division immediately moved to Neufchâteau for training, as most of {{the division}}'s soldiers were raw recruits, new to military service. Because of this, much of the division's force was trained by the experienced French forces. It trained extensively with the other three US divisions, organized as the U.S. I Corps in January 1918, before being moved into a quiet sector of the trenches in February.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, The Amazing Maleeni, a small-time magician, performs an amazing feat to impress a heckler—he turns his head 360 degrees. So when he is later found without a head at all, Mulder and Scully <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> case and discover an angry ex-con, an unimpressed rival, and Maleeni’s twin brother. All seem {{to have something to}} do with a plan to rob a major bank.|$|E

5|$|The {{show was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to take}} place 20 March 2016, however, after {{it was announced that}} President Barack Obama was scheduled to <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same day, concerns were raised and {{the decision was made to}} reschedule the concert to 25 March 2016. Shortly before the rescheduled concert date, Pope Francis attempted to delay it, asking that the band play on a later date as the concert was scheduled for 25 March 2016, which was Good Friday, a major and solemn Christian holiday. The Vatican also suggested that the band delay the start of their concert until midnight to avoid the holy day. However, the Stones opted to play the concert at the originally scheduled date and time.|$|E
5|$|Though Line A ran on a {{different}} voltage {{to the rest of}} the network, it was converted to the 1500v used on the rest of the network when the 200 Series trains began to <b>arrive.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, Line B has traditionally been the most troublesome of the network given its different voltage and the fact that it uses third rail electrification as opposed to the overhead lines used on the rest of the network, making it in effect a separate entity not capable of sharing its stock with other lines. Presently this line uses 1960's rolling stock acquired from Tokyo's Eidan Marunouchi Line, along with CAF 5000 and CAF 6000 stock acquired from Madrid which are to replace the aging Eidan stock. The line, along with its remaining third rail stock, is being converted to overhead lines at 1500v, after which the entire network will be standardised.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving on}} the Western Front, Godley {{continued}} to fulfill {{his role as the}} overall commander of the NZEF in addition to his corps command. By September 1917, as reinforcements from New Zealand continued to <b>arrive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western Front to replace the casualties lost in the major battles of the previous two years, Allen, still the Minister of Defence, was concerned by the drain on New Zealand's manpower. Allen considered that Australia and Canada were not making their proper contributions to the war effort. In response, Godley pointed out that the Australian divisions had seen more action than the New Zealanders.|$|E
