25|$|Nevertheless, Farmer {{focused the}} efforts of the {{institution}} on Bahá'í themes. In her words in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and place my feet on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught me to look away from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as I had never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than <b>any</b> <b>I</b> have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E

500|$|Several Jewish {{authors of}} the 10th and 11th centuries write about the Jews resorting to the Western Wall for devotional purposes. Ahimaaz relates that Rabbi Samuel ben Paltiel (980-1010) gave money for oil at [...] "the {{sanctuary}} at the Western Wall." [...] Benjamin of Tudela (1170) wrote [...] "In front of this place is the Western Wall, {{which is one of}} the walls of the Holy of Holies. This is called the Gate of Mercy, and hither come all the Jews to pray before the Wall in the open court." [...] The account gave rise to confusion about the actual location of Jewish worship and some suggest that Benjamin in fact referred to the Eastern Wall along with its Gate of Mercy. While Nahmanides (d. 1270) did not mention a synagogue near the Western Wall in his detailed account of the temple site, shortly before the Crusader period a synagogue existed at the site. Obadiah of Bertinoro (1488) states [...] "the Westen Wall, part of which is still standing, is made of great, thick stones, larger than <b>any</b> <b>I</b> have seen in buildings of antiquity in Rome or in other lands." ...|$|E
500|$|Even though {{improvements}} {{were made}} the ground suffered problems when hosting large crowds, due to narrow surrounding streets and {{a shortage of}} turnstiles. A reporter for the Manchester Football News summarised the access problems: [...] "The croft is a nightmare in wet weather, and altogether the approach is easily the worst of <b>any</b> <b>I</b> know". On occasion, further problems occurred inside the ground as well as outside. A 1913 cup tie against Sunderland drew a crowd officially recorded as 41,709, but believed to be significantly higher. An hour before kick-off the gates were closed, with many ticket-holders unable to gain admission. The crowd was so large that once the match kicked off the crowd began to spill onto the pitch, a problem which worsened as the game progressed. Sunderland's Charles Buchan recalled that [...] "Before half-time they were three or four yards inside the touchlines." [...] A Sunderland goal in the 58th minute caused further encroachment, forcing the referee to abandon the match. An FA inquiry into the events on the terraces gave rise to debate {{on the issue of}} crowd control at sporting events. Use of mounted police was a particularly contentious issue, the chairman of the committee asking [...] "If the ball struck a horse, and the creature plunged among the people, who was to be held responsible for any injuries that might accrue?" ...|$|E
