50|$|The {{airport is}} {{nominally}} {{divided into two}} terminals, located 250 m apart and linked by an internal pedestrian connection both airside and landside. In practice, however, the <b>airside</b> <b>parts</b> of the terminal buildings are not divided into Terminal 1 (the former domestic terminal) and Terminal 2 (the former international terminal) but to Schengen and non-Schengen areas. The terminal capacity of the airport is approximately 16-17 million passengers per year.|$|E
5000|$|Airport {{operators}} {{make use}} of special airside airport buses for crew and passenger transport in the secure <b>airside</b> <b>parts</b> of an airport. Some public authorities, police forces, and military forces {{make use of}} armoured buses {{where there is a}} special need to provide increased passenger protection. The United States Secret Service acquired two in 2010 for transporting dignitaries needing special protection. Police departments make use of police buses for a variety of reasons, such as prisoner transport, officer transport, temporary detention facilities, and as command and control vehicles. Some fire departments also use a converted bus as a command post while those in cold climates might retain a bus as a heated shelter at fire scenes. [...] Many are drawn from retired school or service buses.|$|E
50|$|On 31 March 1999, the {{remainder}} of RAF Manston closed, leaving FSCTE as the sole occupant of the previous domestic side of the base. The <b>airside</b> <b>part</b> of the base was signed over to the existing commercial operator to form Kent International Airport. In April 2007 the Army assumed responsibility for firefighting throughout the British armed forces, {{with the creation of}} the Defence Fire Risk Management Organisation (DFRMO) at Andover. This led to the transfer of FSCTE from RAF Strike Command at RAF High Wycombe to HQ Land Forces at Wilton (now Andover), controlled locally by HQ 2 Brigade at Shorncliffe Barracks, Folkestone.|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} research of propane co-fire {{of the wood}} fuel {{at different stages of}} the swirling flame flow formation has shown: At the primary stage of propane co-fire of the wood fuel increasing a rate of propane co-fire results in an increased rate of the flame temperature rise by enhancing the wood fuel gasification and burnout of the volatiles. Decreasing a height of the wood layer inside of gasifier promotes a gradual transition to the self-sustaining wood fuel burnout, while the propane co-fire provides complete burnout of the volatiles, increasing the rate of the heat production, flame temperature, combustion efficiency and volume fraction of CO 2 in the flame reaction zone. The more pronounced increase of combustion efficiency is detected along the <b>airside</b> <b>part</b> of the swirling flame flow, where the enhanced burnout of the volatiles results in correlating decrease of the air excess. The less pronounced variations are detected for the mass fraction of NOx, when co-firing of the wood fuel with propane flame flow results in slight decrease of the mass fraction of NOx in {{the central part of the}} flame reaction zone. Moreover, because of low-temperature staged combustion of the volatiles downstream of swirling flame flow, the peak value of the mass fraction of NOx does not exceed 800 - 100 ppm, indicating that the joint utilization of swirl-induced low temperature staged combustion and co-firing of the wood fuel with propane and wood fuel can be used as the tools for NOx reduction...|$|R
