40|$|The paper aim is {{to develop}} and study {{possible}} energy-efficiency measures for machined forgings drawing on analysis {{of the impact of}} the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> <b>machining</b> and its scatter. The most sophisticated option to take into consideration the effect of the cut depth is the work-piece machining in which the forging allowance value results from the blank production. Research of power consumption was conducted for turning the cylindrical surface of 144 mm length and  1, 5 33 0, 5   diameter on forgings of the work-pieces "screw of steering control" made from steel 60 PP. A radial dimension allowance at said cylindrical surface at six points of the five sections was sized to assess the allowance value dispersion. The size of the sample measurements at the control points was n = 600. Statistic processing has shown normal law of distribution and sample homogeneity. To analyze the results of experiments was calculated a range of allowances for this workpiece. Calculated minimum and maximum allowance per one side for rough lathing were, respectively, 0. 905 mm and 1. 905 mm. It was found that 77 % points under control lie in calculated range of allowance values. And there are no points out of the range on lesser side that proves a lack of rejects; but there are points out of the range on the bigger side, that will require additional costs for machining the specified surface, including the cost of electricity. There were three power consumption calculations based on factory- recommended duty: for processing the entire sample of forgings with an average <b>allowance,</b> <b>for</b> <b>machining</b> forgings allowances of which are within the recommended design range of allowance, and for processing the entire sample of forgings with a minimum value of allowance. It was found that elimination of allowance values which are outside the recommended range enables to reduce the power consumption, at least, by 6 %, and the overall power consumption for processing the measured forgings exceeds the minimum possible one by 80 %. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCurrently {{composite}} manufacturing process, such as linear {{friction welding}} plus NC machining, {{is the main}} method for the manufacturing and repairing of complex parts with integrated structure. Due to different datum position and inevitable distortion from different processes, {{it is important to}} ensure sufficient <b>machining</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> complex parts during the NC machining process. In this paper, a workpiece localization approach <b>for</b> <b>machining</b> <b>allowance</b> optimization of complex parts based on CMM inspection is developed. This technique concerns an alignment process to ensure sufficient stock <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the single parts as well as the whole integrated parts. The mathematical model of the constrained alignment is firstly established, and then the symmetric block solution strategy is proposed to solve the optimization model. Experiment result shows that the approach is appropriate and feasible to distribute the <b>machining</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the single and whole parts <b>for</b> adaptive <b>machining</b> of complex parts...|$|R

There is therefore a deduction for expenses related to acquisition of income if these are higher than the basic allowance.

40|$|The report {{outlines}} the strategy for beam-based commissioning of the Linac 4 3 MeV chopper line as currently {{scheduled to start}} {{in the second half}} of 2011 in the Test Stand Area. A dedicated temporary diagnostics test bench will complement the measurement devices foreseen for permanent installation in the chopper line. A commissioning procedure is set out as a series of consecutive phases, each one supposed to meet a well- defined milestone in the path to fully characterise the beam-line. Specific set-ups for each stage are defined in terms of beam characteristics, machine settings and diagnostics used. Operational guidelines are given and expected results at the relative points of measurements are shown for simulated scenarios (on the basis of multi-particle tracking studies carried out with the codes PATH and TRACEWin). These are then interpreted in the light of the resolution limits of the available diagnostics instruments to assess the precision reach on individual measurements and the feasibility of techniques aimed at finding working points via particular signatures and signal variations. Where possible different techniques are compared for cross-validation. An attempt is also made to define a time schedule in terms of the number of shifts necessary to accomplish each phase, the baseline assumption being of a single 8 hrs shift per day with two main commissioners on duty and dedicated support for all essential systems (diag nostics, RF, power, controls, vacuum, source experts etc.). A 50 % <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> general <b>machine</b> unavailability has been assumed. All hardware commissioning and cold check-out tests are outside the scope of this note and are assumed to have already been completed by the start time of beam commissioning...|$|R

30|$|In {{the pilot}} ETSs in China, a {{majority}} of <b>allowances</b> are allocated <b>for</b> free, with a relatively small portion being auctioned in Shenzhen and Guangdong. Grandfathering is applied to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> cogeneration units in Guangdong, and benchmarking is adopted to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> coal-fired and gas-fired units in Shanghai. As China has a steadily growing economy, a benchmarking method based on actual output (rather than historical output) is planned to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> generation companies in the national level ETS, in order to balance emission reduction and economic growth.|$|R

30|$|Third, auctions {{should be}} {{introduced}} into the <b>allowance</b> allocation <b>for</b> takers. In China, Guangdong is the first and currently the only pilot province to introduce auctions into the allowance allocation. After the first pilot year (July 2013 –July 2014), the compliance rate of enterprises and the allowance on CO 2 emissions reduction achieved 98.90 and 99.97  %, respectively. In the Guangdong industrial sectors, the enterprises must acquire a 3  % allowance through auction, and they can then activate a 97  % <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> free; for large public buildings, 100  % are allocated for free by benchmarking before the compliance period. At present, the government-allocated <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the enterprises is free in Beijing. However, the CET will eventually be completely adjusted by the market, {{as is the case}} for CET in the EU (European Union). Specifically, a certain level of auction, such as 3  %, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers; and a lesser amount for auction, which should be smaller than the proportion of auction in the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the givers; alternatively, 100  % can be free <b>for</b> the <b>allowance</b> of the givers.|$|R

5000|$|Emissions allocation: Under the Clear Skies Act, {{emission}} allowances are to {{be allocated}} based on historical fuel consumption, what {{is often referred to}} as [...] "grandfathering". Under the Clean Air Planning Act, a grandfathering approach is used to allocate emission <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> SO2, but <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> NOx, mercury, and CO2, are allocated using an output-based scheme. Under this approach, referred to as a generation performance standard (GPS), generators are given <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> each unit of electricity they generate. The number of <b>allowances</b> allocated <b>for</b> each unit of generation changes each year as the total generation from covered sources changes.
