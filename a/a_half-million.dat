5|$|A {{pattern of}} {{irregularities}} {{has been discovered}} concerning the updating of the list when citizens of Croatia turn 18 or die. In 2005, {{it was estimated that}} the register contained a large number of irregularities and erroneous entries. Since then, public attention was directed to the issue by NGOs monitoring elections through roundtables and advertising campaigns; according to GONG—a NGO specializing in election monitoring—although the register was improved, there is room for further improvement. The 2011 census also indicated a large number of voters in the registry who should not be there, leading to claims that up to <b>a</b> <b>half-million</b> voters in the registry should not be included.|$|E
5|$|In Mahanoro, {{the biggest}} city near the cyclone's {{landfall}} in Madagascar, Eline disrupted power and water supplies while also leaving the town isolated. About 80% of buildings were {{damaged or destroyed}} there. In Marolambo, a village in eastern Madagascar, Eline killed six people. Heavy rainfall in the central portion of the nation caused landslides and flooding. Flooding also occurred in the west coast near Belo. The storm disrupted portions {{of at least three}} highways. The storm left about 10,000people homeless, with about 1,500people forced to stay in storm shelters. Damage to public buildings was estimated at $300,000 (2000USD), Nationwide, Eline killed at least 64people and affected about <b>a</b> <b>half-million</b> people affected.|$|E
5|$|In Shreveport, meanwhile, {{whatever}} positive momentum {{the team}} had gained {{at the end of}} the 1994 season failed to carry over into 1995. Notable NFL quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver was signed and put up decent numbers; the rest of the team, however, was unable to muster much success and limped to a 5–13 record. As elsewhere, the team saw a second season attendance decline. With the season winding down, the city had clearly soured on the Gliebermans. They became embroiled in legal difficulties and, in one particularly absurd incident, Bernie Glieberman had his lawyer attempt (unsuccessfully) to abscond with <b>a</b> <b>half-million</b> dollar Tucker automobile that Glieberman had donated to a local museum.|$|E

5|$|The first mall to {{be opened}} in College Station, Post Oak is the largest mall within the Brazos Valley area. At its opening, it became the city's largest employer, and nearly doubled its city sales tax revenues. Though the mall {{generated}} additional traffic and added to the demand on city services, it also generated $1 million in annual sales tax revenue, $120,000 in property taxes, and <b>a</b> <b>half-million</b> in taxes for the city school district. It is credited with creating the first major impetus for growing economic and commercial developments for College Station, which previously lacked a major retail community. The mall generates over 75 percent of the area's retail sales through its approximately eleven million annual visitors. It remains the city's largest taxpayer and its second largest employer. It is also the top employer of the students of nearby Texas A University.|$|E
5|$|The planetarium {{has been}} reopened for other {{purposes}} since it closed its doors as a planetarium in 1995. On March 5, 1998, an initial three-year agreement was signed that brought the Children's Own Museum {{to the second floor}} of the planetarium, where the Astrocentre used to be. Due to impending construction at the adjacent Royal Ontario Museum, the contract was not renewed in late 2002, and the Children's Own Museum has been looking for a new location ever since. During its three-year tenure in that building, it hosted nearly <b>a</b> <b>half-million</b> visitors. The institution still exists, though it currently (as of 2009) has no physical home. It is currently seeking suitable space to use in future endeavours. In the meantime the organization has participated in various children's events around the city.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its opening, it was the largest mall complex {{developed}} by CBL. In the first year, it was projected that the mall would employee 2,500 employees—instantly making it the largest employer in the city; this was expected to expand to 3,500 with the completion of the second phase. It was hoped it would generate $80 million in sales. In addition to helping to retain local shoppers who might otherwise travel the 2½ hours southeast to Houston for mall shopping, CBL and city officials expected the mall would draw shoppers from around the Brazos Valley. Before its opening, the city did not have a highly developed retail community. With the planned additions, then College Station city manager North Bardell said it was expected to generate $1 million in annual sales tax revenue, nearly equal to what the city collected in the previous fiscal year from all other sales. It would bring in another $120,000 in property taxes, <b>a</b> <b>half-million</b> in taxes for College Station Independent School District, and $1 million in electric bills. The increase in jobs was seen as good for the community, and the city hoped it would attract new civic groups to the area. Taking a year longer than originally planned, the expansion was completed in 1985.|$|E
