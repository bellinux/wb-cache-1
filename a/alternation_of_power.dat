40|$|The Japanese {{political}} system has conventionally been {{perceived as a}} parliamentary system, which indicates that executive power depends on the national assembly. Such a parliamentary system could with coherent governing parties show decisive power in the policy-making processes. After the political reforms were implemented in 1994, some prime ministers did indeed show such decisive power in Japan, and presently the prime minister enjoys almost a free hand. At present the problem of Japanese politics arguably lies on an excessively powerful prime minister.

40|$|On May 23, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto {{signed a}} series of bills to {{implement}} constitutional changes to the country’s political and electoral processes. The reforms bring {{some of the most}} dynamic shifts to Mexican politics since the 1990 s, including a makeover of the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE). The IFE has {{played a major role in}} Mexico’s transition to democracy. As the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) gradually lost power to opposition groups, the IFE was the key arbiter in assuring the transparency and legitimacy of elections. The IFE helped usher in Mexico’s first <b>alternation</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> in 71 years when the PRI lost the presidency in 2000.

Under the 2014 reforms, the National Electoral Institute (INE) has replaced the IFE.

40|$|Participation and {{legitimate}} opposition are two central features of what Robert Dahl identified as polyarchies. Despite normative emphases {{on the importance}} of political opposition for ‘more’ democracy, studies of opposition parties are yet to flourish. By comparing the British Labour Party and the Democratic Party of Japan, this paper will explore {{the way in which the}} practice of a political party in opposition has an impact on the party's performance once in government. Both Britain and Japan are known to be parliamentary democracies, experiencing an <b>alternation</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> by landslide: Britain in 1997 and Japan in 2009. However, the Labour government in Britain and the coalition government led by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) showed a remarkable difference in their abilities to put their election manifestoes into practice, as well as in their courses of policy position after they took power. To understand the discrepancy between the Labour Party and the DPJ in their performances in government, this paper will argue that the power resources provided for the party leadership, and the intra-party decisionmaking system, both of which are set during the years in opposition, define, to a significant extent, the strength of the political leadership once in government...|$|E

40|$|The {{people of}} Ghana are gearing {{themselves}} up for general elections in December 2 008. Election 2 008 {{would be a}} historic fifth consecutive national poll {{since the start of}} the current constitutional democratic dispensation in 1 992. The transitional presidential election of November 1 992 was highly disputed by the opposition parties leading to their boycott of the subsequent parliamentary poll that December. The acrimony no doubt had arisen from the fact that the outgoing military regime that had metamorphosed into a political party to contest that election was perceived to have rigged elections. It was from such shaky foundation that Ghanas current dispensation has blossomed. The subsequent elections (1996, 2 004, and 2 004) have been more peaceful and generally free and fair.

40|$|Viktor Yanukovich's {{victory in}} the Ukrainian presidential {{election}} Sunday has predictably sparked a spate of commentary that Ukraine's Orange Revolution {{has come to an}} end. This conclusion seems natural given that it was the same Yanukovich's efforts to steal the 2004 presidential election that led to the Orange Revolution. At first glance, {{it is difficult to imagine}} a more clear symbolic rebuke to the western oriented reform agenda of President Viktor Yuschenko, who defeated Yanukovich in 2004, but received only 5 % of the vote in the first round of this election, and to Yulia Timoschenko, the other major leader of the Orange Revolution, who lost to Yanukovich on Sunday, than Yanukovich's victory. This, at least, is how the election has been portrayed in most media. A narrative has been created that the elections of 2004 and 2010 represented swings in the Ukrainian electorate signaling the beginning and end of the Orange Revolution. An alternative narrative has also emerged claiming that Yanukovich's victory is evidence of the success of the Orange Revolution. <b>Alternation</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> through fair elections, as Ukraine has just experienced, is, after all, a defining characteristic of a democracy. However, there is a considerably more plausible, if less dramatic, explanation of the events of the last decade or so in Ukraine.

40|$|Student {{activism}} {{has been}} pivotal in Ghana’s political and democratic history. Prior to Ghana’s Fourth Republic, student activism was highly confrontational and entailed student support or {{opposition to the}} various regimes depending {{on the extent to}} which the regimes were accepted by all as being rightful or legitimate. After 23 years of uninterrupted constitutional democracy, Ghana has earned the accolade of being a successful electoral democracy. However, in terms of democratic progression, the mere conduct of periodic elections that sometimes lead to <b>alternation</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> is described as elementary and a low quality democracy. Given that Ghana’s democratisation process since 1992 has not been static, some remarkable strides have been made in improving the nation’s democratic quality. Using a purely qualitative research design and interviews with some former student activists, this study argues that the modest strides made in the quest for high quality liberal democracy in Ghana cannot be meaningfully discussed without acknowledging the invaluable contributions of student activism. The study further suggests a relationship between democratic quality and student activism. It postulates that the shift from the usually oppositional and sometimes violent student activism in Ghana’s Fourth Republic could partially be attributed to the country’s strides made in the drive towards democratic maturity. For students to continue their role as vanguards of democracy in Ghana, the study recommends an amalgamation of all tertiary networks and other student splinter groups under the National Union of Ghana Students; and a shift in the modus operandi of the Union from confrontation to the use of dialogue and other peaceful democratic means to achieve its objectives. This could contribute to the restoration of the Union’s former glory as a united, national and independent mouth-piece of students in all national issues. <br /...|$|E
40|$|From {{being the}} "Celtic Tiger" poster child of neo-liberalism, Ireland has moved first into {{recession}} {{and then into}} an IMF-EU bailout entailing massive cuts, with unemployment at the highest-recorded levels ever, the historically dominant Fianna Fail party alternatively in third or fourth place in polls and an unprecedented level of withdrawal of trust. Yet by contrast with the political upheavals in Iceland and Greece and the dramatic protests in countries like Britain, France and Italy, Ireland has seen remarkably little by way of active protest. The few large events have been determinedly single-issue or thoroughly corralled by conservative unions, radical attempts at organising coordinated movement resistance let alone alternative social directions have failed comprehensively to mobilise popular support, and all the indications are that the election {{will lead to a}} relatively routine <b>alternation</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> with Labour as junior partner in a government committed to a modified version of neo-liberal austerity. While the Irish left has discussed the economic side of the crisis ad nauseam, little serious attention (in politics or academia) has been given to understanding this situation, which is rather taken as a given. This paper attempts an {{answer to the question of}} why responses to the crisis have been so restricted to organisational fixes. It starts with a broad analysis of the shaping of popular agency in Ireland via the long-term effects of nationalism, the channelling of popular hopes through state-led modernisation and the institutionalisation of self-organisation, with particular attention to the unresolved issues of "carceral Catholicism" in the South and war in the North. Discussing left parties, unions, community activism and social movements, the paper explores Ireland's "Piven and Cloward" moment in the failure of organisational substitutionalism through electoralism, social partnership, clientelism and populism. If modernisation and social partnership together represented a form of passive revolution, constructing a new hegemony in the wake of the collapse of nationalist autarky, the underlying relations constructed in this period seem remarkably unshaken by state withdrawal from this programme. In this context it argues that casual reference to counter-hegemony as a simple collection of moments of cultural opposition is a wilful misunderstanding of the problem, politically and intellectually, and that the real challenge is to construct a coherent alternative which has the capacity of becoming hegemonic in its turn in both these dimensions. Given this analysis of the context of Irish movement activity, what can or should organisers do, in the historically new situation created after the end of the "Celtic Tiger"? The paper argues that simple alliances between the leaderships of organisations which in practice privilege their engagement with existing institutional arrangements over popular self-organisation will not be enough, and explores the outcomes of attempts at alliance-building in three arenas: unions, social movements and community groups; electoral politics; and street protest...|$|E
