5|$|Written by Gerry Davis, this four-part {{story was}} {{submitted}} on spec {{to the production}} office around February 1982. It concerned the Doctor arriving on Mondas <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> time when the Cybermen are being created. The rough storyline was where the Doctor and his companion “Felicity” arrive on the planet Mondas, Earth's twin orbiting {{on the opposite side}} of the Sun. While the Doctor works on a piece of TARDIS equipment, Felicity encounters the gentle Prince Sylvan. Sylvan accidentally activates the TARDIS, sending him, the Doctor and Felicity fifty years into the future. There, Sylvan's brother, Dega, is now king and has used the Doctor's device to begin turning his people into Cybermen. He has constructed a space fleet with which he intends to invade the mineral-rich Earth, and plans to kill any unconverted Mondans with cyanide gas. Felicity appeals to Dega's partly Cybernised wife, Queen Meta, and she shoots her husband dead—only to be killed by Dega's chief of staff, Krail. In the confusion, Sylvan and a band of Mondan rebels flee in the spaceships to Earth; the massive concussion of take-off knocks Mondas out of its orbit into deep space. Former script editor Davis submitted this idea circa early 1981, intending it to be a prequel to his and Kit Pedler's original Cyberman serial, The Tenth Planet (which also featured Cyberman Krail). It also borrowed elements from The Ark and The Savages, two stories which Davis had been story editor on. Producer John Nathan-Turner and script editor Antony Root were ultimately not interested in Genesis of the Cybermen. Davis wrote his storyline with only the Doctor and one female companion in mind; he called this character “Felicity” rather than writing with any particular companion in mind. This idea would be later explored in the Big Finish audio adventure Spare Parts by Marc Platt and released in July 2002. In turn Spare Parts was heavily borrowed from for the television episodes Rise of the Cybermen and The Age of Steel in 2006.|$|E

25|$|Trend {{lines are}} {{sometimes}} used in business analytics to show changes in data over time. This {{has the advantage}} of being simple.

This is a simple technique, and does not require a control group, experimental design, or a sophisticated analysis technique. However, it suffers from a lack of scientific validity in cases where other potential changes can affect the data.|$|E

25|$|In each {{reference}} frame, {{an observer}} {{can use a}} local coordinate system (most exclusively Cartesian coordinates in this context) to measure lengths, and a clock to measure time intervals. An observer is a real or imaginary entity that can take measurements, say humans, or any other living organism—or even robots and computers. An event is something that happens <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> space at an instant of time, or more formally a point in spacetime. The transformations connect the space and time coordinates of an event as measured by an observer in each frame.|$|E
25|$|A flow {{that is not}} a {{function}} of time is called steady flow. Steady-state flow refers to the condition where the fluid properties <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the system do not change over time. Time dependent flow is known as unsteady (also called transient). Whether a particular flow is steady or unsteady, can depend on the chosen frame of reference. For instance, laminar flow over a sphere is steady in the frame of reference that is stationary with respect to the sphere. In a frame of reference that is stationary with respect to a background flow, the flow is unsteady.|$|E

With an advance forecast of demand and pricing flexibility, buyers will self-sort {{based on their}} price sensitivity (using more power in off-peak hours or going to the theater mid-week), their demand sensitivity (must have the higher cost early morning flight or {{must go to the}} Saturday night opera) or their time of purchase (usually paying a premium for booking late).|$|E

25|$|Zero-point {{energy is}} {{fundamentally}} {{related to the}} Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Roughly speaking, the uncertainty principle states that complementary variables (such as a particle's position and momentum, or a field's value and derivative <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> space) cannot simultaneously be specified precisely by any given quantum state. In particular, there cannot exist a state in which the system simply sits motionless {{at the bottom of}} its potential well: for, then, its position and momentum would both be completely determined to arbitrarily great precision. Therefore, instead, the lowest-energy state (the ground state) of the system must have a distribution in position and momentum that satisfies the uncertainty principle−−which implies its energy must be greater than the minimum of the potential well.|$|E
