5|$|The seven-minute long video depicts Beyoncé {{playing a}} beauty pageant contest {{representing}} Third Ward, Houston, {{the area in}} which she grew up. It opens with the sound of a poignant piano and shots of Beyoncé sporting short hair, looking <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the mirror. It transitions to a segment of her fellow contestants preparing for the pageant backstage, combing their hair, fitting their dresses and analyzing their bodies; one scene during the preparations shows Beyoncé arguing with another contestant over a hair dryer. Multiple shots of the singer follow, of which depict her sitting on a floor and leaving a bathroom after vomiting. The clip then sees contestants looking tired and distressed backstage.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} 2011 with Cocoro {{traveling}} to SPHIA to interview Inubushi, when her plane experiences turbulence and crashes on Mount Akakura. Yuni and Yomogi get the unconscious Cocoro and Mayuzumi {{to an emergency}} cabin to take shelter from the blizzard. In 2012, Satoru falls from the SPHIA facility's clock tower and loses consciousness. Cocoro wakes up {{in a room and}} is relieved to find that Yuni is safe. Yuni does not recognize her; when looking <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> a mirror, she sees a man's body. Similarly, Satoru wakes up in a woman's body. Both eventually switch back to their respective bodies, but the phenomenon continues, with their minds moving between their bodies; they conclude that their consciousnesses are transcending time and space. In the cabin, a news article dated July 4, 2011 is found, which says that Yuni was the only survivor, with the other three having died in an avalanche on January 17. Satoru finds a key in his room, but does not know what it unlocks.|$|E
25|$|Scottish author George MacDonald {{also wrote}} a fantasy novel {{entitled}} Lilith, {{first published in}} 1895. MacDonald employed the character of Lilith in service to a spiritual drama about sin and redemption, in which Lilith finds a hard-won salvation. Many of the traditional characteristics of Lilith mythology {{are present in the}} author's depiction: Long dark hair, pale skin, a hatred and fear of children and babies, and an obsession with gazing <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> a mirror. MacDonald's Lilith also has vampiric qualities: she bites people and sucks their blood for sustenance.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is some mistake," [...] said Jeanie, confounded <b>at</b> finding <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the {{apartment}} of an invalid; [...] "the servant {{told me that the}} minister--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] The man disappeared, {{and after}} another {{interval}} Adeline came in. She showed the trepidation she felt <b>at</b> finding <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> {{the presence of}} an interviewer.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> {{critically}} <b>in</b> the glass. Her maid Fanchon--a little French waif {{picked up}} in the slums of Soho--helped to readjust a stray curl which had rebelled against the comb.|$|R
25|$|Van Stipriaan further {{reports that}} other tales {{describe}} river travellers (usually men) chancing upon the spirit. She is inevitably grooming herself, combing her hair, and peering <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> a mirror. Upon noticing the intruder, she flees {{into the water}} and leaves her possessions behind. The traveller then takes the invaluable items. Later, Mami Wata appears to the thief in his dreams to demand the return of her things. Should he agree, she further demands a promise from him to be sexually faithful to her. Agreement grants the person riches; refusal to return the possessions or to be faithful brings the man ill fortune.|$|E
500|$|Goodridge {{completed}} Beauty Revealed in 1828, likely {{from looking}} <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> a mirror. Several works {{have been cited}} as possible inspirations, including John Vanderlyn's Ariadne Asleep on the Island of Naxos and Horatio Greenough's sculpture Venus Victrix. Goodridge sent her portrait to Webster {{when he was a}} new widower, and, based on its miniature format, it was likely intended for his eyes alone. The American art critic John Updike suggests that the artist intended it to offer herself to Webster; he writes that the bared breasts appear to say [...] "We are yours for the taking, in all our ivory loveliness, with our tenderly stippled nipples". Ultimately, however, Webster married another, wealthier woman.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{confessed that}} it was not easy for him {{to come up with the}} lyrics to [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] in that length of time. But two hours later, he had written the verses, and the hook, in spite of being hung over. Harrison had also made {{provision}} for a backing track; he played all the instruments on the track. The bridge was written by Beyoncé, who was inspired by looking <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the mirror; as she was not wearing matching clothes and her hair was untidy, she kept saying, [...] "I'm looking so crazy right now." [...] Harrison sang back to her and said, [...] "That's the hook." [...] It also inspired the title of the song. After that Beyoncé had filled up the middle eight, she came up with the catchphrase – [...] "Uh-oh, uh-oh, you know" [...] – alongside Harrison.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> {{critically}} <b>in</b> the glass, {{and adjusted}} a curl, which looked its best {{when it was}} rebellious. She scrutinised her own face carefully; why? she could not tell: another of those subtle feminine instincts perhaps.|$|R
60|$|And then, chilled and numb in {{body and}} mind, she crept into her bed again and <b>at</b> last lost <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> sleep.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> him, leaving <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> his hands. He {{went over}} the brim of the declivity and began to climb down.|$|R
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Early Winter" [...] {{was directed by}} Stefani's frequent collaborator Sophie Muller, who had previously directed the music videos of [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Wind It Up". Filming of the music video took place at destinations like Budapest, Milan, and Prague, where Stefani had been touring during The Sweet Escape Tour in October 2007. It opens with a black-and-white scene of Stefani {{lying on the ground}} in a long white gown. In the next scene, Stefani is shown walking on the street under red street lights and then holds her love interest, played by her tour backup dancer Steelo Vazquez, against the wall and talks to him. The scene then changes to Stefani walking on a street and later walking into the railway station. In the next scene, Stefani is seen singing under falling red-coloured feathers in a huge palace-type hall. Scenes of Stefani staring <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the mirror with her hair up and snow falling slowly down, with the lights turning on and off intermittently, are interspersed throughout the video. Stefani is also seen sitting on the ground and singing while crying. She is then shown at a railway station walking besides a moving train. The video ends with Stefani running out of the hall. Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy praised the video for being [...] "acutely artful, immeasurably stylish" [...] and commented that [...] "Gwen’s managed to raise the bar on her own superlatively supreme style in her new video." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a three-day-long cocaine binge in 2005, Carlisle {{says she}} looked <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> {{the mirror and}} [...] "didn't see a light or a soul" [...] in her eyes: [...] "I just thought, ‘I know I don’t look like myself anymore.'" [...] The same morning, she had an {{auditory}} hallucination telling her she would be found dead {{in a hotel room}} if she did not stop using drugs. The incident jarred Carlisle into seeking sobriety, and she has been sober since 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Due to Anna Lizas success, Vega {{was dubbed}} the [...] "Original Soap Opera Princess". Director Ruel Bayani, the {{producer}} of ABS-CBN's remake of Anna Liza, commended Vega, calling her portrayal of the role [...] "iconic" [...] and that she set a high standard on being a [...] "child star". Judy Ann Santos once stated on StarStudio's special issue about Santos herself {{that she is a}} fan of Vega, and when she learned about the latter's death, she first disappeared into her room and then into the bathroom. She turned the bathroom's doorknob quietly, pushed the door shut then {{stood in front of the}} sink. She then looked <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the mirror and cried.|$|E
60|$|This was unexpected; and {{she could}} not <b>at</b> once harden <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> displeasure, so that though she spoke not, her countenance was relenting.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{surprised}} {{will the}} pretty prude be <b>at</b> seeing <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> {{a family of}} men, when she expects to be admitted amongst the hoods and pinners of Dame Marjory's waiting women! Thou hast not many of the tender sex in thy household, I take it, Ramorny?" ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Black September Event, Choice's whereabouts were unknown. Seeing as how the Squad themselves may have no longer existed in this altered reality, it is very possible that Amy Tran Kwitny never became Choice and lived a normal life or, rather, may not have ever existed <b>at</b> all <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the Post-Black September world.|$|R
2500|$|In {{her first}} {{interview}} since the incident, Jackson appeared on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman on March 29, 2004, which increased the show's ratings over 20%. In April 2004, Jackson poked fun <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> {{an appearance on}} Saturday Night Live, first while playing Condoleezza Rice in a skit, nervously answering a question by exposing her right breast (which was pixelated by NBC), and again by viewing a mock home video from her childhood in which her bathing suit top came off in a wading pool, calling it a [...] "swimsuit malfunction". An NBC spokesman said Jackson was wearing a bra beneath her blouse during the skit. During a performance on ABC's Good Morning America, the network promoted Jackson's appearance as her [...] "first live performance since the Super Bowl", hinting at the chance of shock value. Blender Magazine recalled [...] "Photographers and camera crews are packed in, in case Jackson decides {{to show us the}} left one. And if all eyes (and cameras) are on her chest, Jackson, 38, responds defiantly by refusing to cloak her breasts in a modest turtleneck. The cleavage is her way of saying 'fuck you.'" [...] In 2006, during an interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Jackson upheld her claim that the Super Bowl scandal was an accident.|$|E
60|$|Clara shrugged her shoulders, {{and looked}} <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> a mirror.|$|E
60|$|She {{dismissed}} her secretary, gazed <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> {{the glass}} and made a grimace.|$|E
60|$|Mysie had {{a certain}} {{confidence}} that mamma would not give her away if all the lords and ladies in the world wanted her; and Gillian confirmed her in that belief, so that no misgiving interfered with her joy <b>at</b> finding <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the train, where Lord Rotherwood declared that the two pair of eyes shone enough to light a candle by.|$|R
50|$|She educated <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> Konstfack <b>in</b> Stockholm. Between 2003-2012 {{she held}} seat number 1 of the Swedish Academy for Children's Books.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come wife," [...] said he, [...] "let {{her have}} {{a pair of}} thick {{stockings}} and a woollen shawl or blanket directly; and tell Dora to give her some warm supper {{as soon as the}} milk boils. You, Violet and Peony, amuse your little friend. She is out of spirits, you see, <b>at</b> finding <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> a strange place. For my part, I will go around among the neighbors, and find out where she belongs." ...|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the glass--the colour {{had left}} her cheeks. She tried to laugh at her self.|$|E
60|$|She became {{absorbed in}} gazing <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the mirror, while she dabbed some powder {{on her nose}} and dabbed it off again.|$|E
6000|$|... "The costume {{is quite}} becoming," [...] Mrs. Barlow murmured, glancing <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the looking-glass, [...] "and I adore those poor dear soldiers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's false!" [...] cried Mrs. Glenarm. [...] "You wretch! Do {{you come}} to me with your trumped-up story? What does Julius Delamayn mean by exposing me to this?" [...] Her indignation <b>at</b> finding <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> {{the same room with}} Anne broke its way through, not the {{restraints}} only, but the common decencies of politeness. [...] "I'll ring for the servants!" [...] she said. [...] "I'll have you turned out of the house." ...|$|R
60|$|Brackets with vases and casts {{here and}} there {{projected}} from the walls, and some charming crayons and water-colours hung round them. The plastered walls had already been marked out in panels, and a growth of frescoes of bulrushes, ivy, and leaves of all kinds was beginning to overspread them, while on a nearer inspection the leaves proved to be fast becoming peopled with living portraits of butterflies and other insects; indeed Mary started <b>at</b> finding <b>herself</b> <b>in,</b> as she thought, unpleasant proximity {{to a pair of}} cockchafers.|$|R
60|$|When Lucy, {{exhausted}} but content, found <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> length <b>in</b> her room, {{she thanked}} God for {{the happiness of}} the evening. It {{was the last time}} she could do that for many weary years.|$|R
60|$|The skirt was fastened. She looked <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> {{the glass}} with the curious {{stiffening}} {{of her face}} generally caused by looking in the glass.|$|E
60|$|Aline glanced <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the mirror. She {{was just}} out of her mistress's range of vision, and she made a little grimace at her reflection.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Ethel!" [...] cried Meta, {{springing}} up in dismay, and looking <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the glass. [...] "What {{is the matter}} with me? Do tell me!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Act one {{is set in}} Sardi's, a New York City Theater District restaurant, {{where two}} {{producers}} are planning a show. Renee Carroll, an actual hat check girl <b>at</b> Sardi's, played <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the musical. Smith and Dale played waiters. The {{second half of the}} revue is the show the producers were planning in act one, and included the Smith and Dale sketch [...] "Doctor Kronkite".|$|R
50|$|This {{psychological}} effect {{is often used}} in the cinema, where an actor will be shown apparently looking <b>at</b> himself or <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> the mirror. What viewers see is different from what the actor sees, because the camera is not right behind the actor, but {{the position of the}} actor is often chosen so that his or her image is nicely framed in the mirror for the camera.|$|R
5000|$|Mayumi is Nanako's younger sister. She {{works as}} a {{part-time}} assistant for a manga publisher and deals with a manga artist named Hanamaru, who has a crush on her. She is rather mischievous at times {{when it comes to}} her sister, but the two are very close. She knows that her sister is very airheaded when it comes to matters of love. She is also aware that Tsuchida has a crush on her sister, and sympathizes with him, knowing that he'll have a hard time trying to get through to her. Ironically, she is similarly obtuse when it comes to peoples' affections aimed <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> (Hanamaru-sensei <b>in</b> particular).|$|R
