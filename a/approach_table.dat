This study demonstrates that the database is easy to maintain, flexible to update, and feasible for data collection both via computer imagery and in the field.

40|$|Abstract—One of the {{important}} components of applied linguistics is to study how computers are used in language teaching. This paper tries to scan the three stages of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) development, the relationship between CALL and linguistic theories and research methods. The paper also discusses some practical issues on CALL in China. Index Terms—CALL, theoretical approaches, CALL research, CALL practice Recent years have seen a bloom of interest in using computers for language teaching and learning. A decade ago, {{the use of computers}} in the language classroom was of concern only to a small number of specialists. However, with the availability of multimedia computing and the Internet, the role of computers in language instruction has now become an important issue confronting large numbers of language teachers throughout the world. This specific field is usually called computer-assisted language learning (CALL). The acronym CALL will be used as a short-cut term, for sake of brevity and convenience, which includes computer-assisted instruction (CAI), computer-assisted language teaching (CALT), computer-assisted language testing (CALT), as well as e-learning (Gu, 2006). I. THE HISTORY OF CALL Computers have been used for language teaching since the 1960 s. The history of CALL can be roughly divided into three main stages: Structural /behavioristic CALL, communicative CALL, and integrative CALL (Warschauer, 2000). Each stage corresponds to a certain level of technology as well as a certain pedagogical <b>approach.</b> <b>Table</b> 1 below shows the three stages of CALL...|$|E

40|$|Selection of reversed-phase liquid {{chromatography}} (RP-LC) C 18 columns with suitable selectivity {{for a given}} analysis is difficult. The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) and other official compendia provide only a general description of the stationary phase {{to be used in}} the operating procedure of an LC method. This information is often insufficient to select a suitable column from a market offering more than 600 brands. Manufacturers provide only limited information about their columns. The need for a general test method to characterize RP-LC columns has existed since the 1970 s. A project to define a suitable procedure characterizing RP-LC C 18 columns by chromatographic tests was started earlier in the Laboratory for Pharmaceutical Analysis. Different tests were collected from the literature. A procedure to measure 36 column parameters was applied, and the repeatability and reproducibility of the parameters were examined in three different laboratories. Of these 36 parameters, 24 were found to be reproducible. Subsequently, a classification of 69 RP-LC C 18 columns, based on these 24 parameters, was obtained by principal component analysis (PCA). However, the measurement of these 24 parameters was labour-intensive and time-consuming. Through additional studies and based on the found correlation, it was possible to reduce the number of column parameters from 24 to just 4. The four selected parameters were the retention factor of amylbenzene, k’amb (i. e. hydrophobicity), the relative retention factor of benzylamine/phenol determined at pH 2. 7, rk’ba/ph pH 2. 7 (i. e. silanol activity), the retention factor of 2, 2 ’-dipyridyl, k’ 2, 2 ’-dip (i. e. silanol activity and metal impurity) and the relative retention factor of triphenylene/o-terphenyl, rk’tri/o-ter (i. e. steric selectivity). These parameters can be determined using three simple, fast, repeatable and reproducible methods. The correlation between column classification, as obtained in the PCA plot, and column selectivity, as determined by the Ph. Eur. separation of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and its impurities, has been demonstrated. It was concluded that columns belonging to the same group showed similar selectivity for the separation of ASA and its impurities. Although a correlation was found, definition of column groups based on the PCA plot was difficult. Therefore, a more practical approach has been developed. This approach begins with the selection of a reference column (e. g. the column on which a method has been developed or a column mentioned in the literature) or a virtual, ideal column. Other columns are then ranked against this reference column, based on the aforementioned four column parameters. This approach has one obvious advantage; that is, the relationship between columns can be expressed using a single value (i. e. F-value). This system has been made freely available on-line on our website: [URL] This approach gave good results for 8 separations of pharmaceuticals (ASA, clindamycin hydrochloride, buflomedil hydrochloride, chloramphenicol sodium succinate, nimesulide, phenoxymethylpenicillin, dihydrostreptomycin sulphate and vancomycin). To evaluate the separations, the chromatographic response factor (CRF) was used, which is a measure of the overall separation. The relationship between the ranking of the columns and their separation performance was investigated. For all separations examined, it was observed that in 7 out of 8 separations, 100 % of these high ranked columns (F 6). Next, intrabatch variability was investigated and low variability was found. During these experiments, it was found that one of the parameters, k’ 2, 2 ’-dip, could not always be properly determined. It was sometimes observed that the 2, 2 ’-dipyridyl peak showed a poor peak shape, a high retention time or that it was not eluted at all. To solve this issue, a phosphate buffer of pH 6. 5 was added to the mobile phase and the determination of the dead volume by the retention time of uracil was simplified. Next, the influence of long term storage (about 15 months) and of use in {{liquid chromatography}} analyses, applied on 55 pairs (same batch) of different RP-LC columns, was studied. After long term storage, small changes of the column characteristics occur for most of the columns, producing slightly increased F-values. A few columns differed by a greater extent and showed considerable changes in silanol activity and hydrophobicity. Most of these columns have no end-capping and/or no base-deactivation, making these stationary phases more vulnerable towards degradation. This effect is observed less with columns with polar embedded groups and/or polar end-capping, protecting the column by blocking the silanol groups and attracting a shielding water layer. Also columns with higher coverages and bulky or long chains show more resistance towards degradation. It was concluded that changes in the stationary phases do occur and these changes are more important when the columns were used for separation instead of simply stored. Two separations (erythromycin and tetracycline), which were developed on a specific column, the XTerra RP, were also examined. The same approach was used as for the 8 separations above. Good results were obtained for erythromycin, while less good for tetracycline. The described column classification system has proven to be a helpful tool to find a suitable column in several separations, but it also has shown to be of more limited value in complex situations as the tetracycline separation. Finally, a comparison of our classification system with that of Euerby et al. was performed. Euerby et al. developed a column characterisation system, based on 6 test parameters, available as Column Selector from Advanced Chemistry Development (ACD) Labs. Comparison of the parameters led to a correlation between the parameters which claimed for the same column property. Principal component analysis showed that RP-LC C 18 columns were classified in a similar way by both systems. For 7 separations (fluoxetine, gemcitabine, erythromycin, tetracycline, tetracaine, amlodipine and bisacodyl), a ranking was build based on an F-value (K. U. Leuven method) or Column Difference Factor value (CDF, Euerby method) versus a (virtual) reference column. Both methods showed similar classification patterns. The coefficient of determination values, calculated for these rankings, were in the range 0. 64 to 0. 90. Therefore, it was concluded that the classification systems are quite similar and both can be helpful in the selection of a suitable column. From a practical point of view, it must be noted that the K. U. Leuven method only includes 4 parameters and 3 chromatographic methods compared to 6 parameters and 4 methods for the Euerby method. Hence, the time needed to determine the chromatographic properties of a column is shorter with the K. U. Leuven <b>approach.</b> <b>Table</b> of contents Acknowledgements i Curriculum Vitae iii List of publications iv Symbols and Abbreviations vii Chapter 1 : General introduction 1. 1 Introduction 1 1. 2

40|$|Sagalassos is {{an ancient}} Pisidian city, located on a south-facing {{mountain}} slope of the Western Taurus mountains in Southwest Anatolia. The city has been inhabited from Classical to Mid Byzantine times, with Late Hellenistic to Early Byzantine times (2 nd century BC until the 7 th century AD) representing its most intensive period of occupation. Sagalassos {{has been the subject}} of ongoing archaeology-driven research since 1986, first as part of the Pisidia Survey Project and from 1989 onwards as subject of the Sagalassos Archaeological Research Project (SARP). Professor Marc Waelkens directed the project between 1989 and 2013; professor Jeroen Poblome from 2014 onwards. The past decades have provided a treasure of information on the history and layout of Sagalassos and its territory, among which the so-called Potters’ Quarter (now referred to as Eastern Suburbium) northeast of the town. In 2010, professors Jeroen Poblome and Patrick Degryse jointly devised a new research project on the Eastern Suburbium of Sagalassos, a topographically, historically and functionally distinctive suburban development in the immediate periphery of the town of Sagalassos. They envisaged an interdisciplinary research programme that would allow us to map the origins of this ‘peri-urban phenomenon’ and its emerging and decreasing functionalities, to unravel its developing social complexity and to approach the general study area of ancient urbanism from a ‘suburban point of view’. Since the study area also harboured the main artisanal quarter of the city, it was expected to hold potential for the documentation of the area’s importance within the regional economy. The main modules for this thesis consisted of the various, mostly unpublished, excavation and survey data from previous campaigns, augmented with new research data (2011 - 2014) collected within the area aimed at answering specific (open) research questions. Because of its location on a high plateau northeast of the city, the Eastern Suburbium is an area that is topographically segregated from both the rest of the town as well as from its surrounding territory. The suburban setting and topographical characteristics of the area resulted into the formation of a suburban texture that is clearly distinguishable in its historical development, layout and attested functionalities. A quarter century of research had yielded a lot of information on this site, but a thorough study of its many facets was still lacking. This project therefore aimed at gathering all available data, filling the remaining knowledge gaps with additional field work, identifying the nature of this suburban ‘phenomenon’ and presenting the data of all previous, current and ongoing research in an integrated, exhaustive and accessible manner. Even though the expertise on the Eastern Suburbium was already considerable due to the varied results from previous campaigns, the first major task consisted of combining all available, but fragmented, old and new data into a comprehensive history of the study area. This approach also led to a reassessment and ultimately to a reinterpretation of our knowledge on all historical and functional aspects of the various sites throughout the Eastern Suburbium. From Hellenistic times onwards the area overlaps to a large extent with the Eastern Necropolis, but the burial practices are mainly concentrated along the steeper, rocky slopes surrounding the area. The central part of the area would develop, from Augustan times onwards, into the main artisanal quarter of the city. Until now only pottery production activities have been conclusively attested within the Eastern Suburbium, but the presence of other crafts (glass working, metallurgy, textile dying, etc.) has been suggested. Specific zones within and in the immediate surroundings of the study area were also used for clay quarrying (the Central Depression), for stone quarrying (the largest eastern quarry is located in the southeast of the Eastern Suburbium) and sarcophagus carving (immediately south of the Central Depression). Finally, the southwestern quarter of the area was taken up between c. 50 AD and c. 350 AD by a series of (semi-) public structures and complexes. Communal dining has been attested at the PQ 2 site, which is tentatively identified as a schola, and we hypothesise the identification of the site G complex as a multi-purpose suburban campus, where for example cattle markets and festivals could be organised. Even though the area covers a geographically distinguishable terrain, the area forms part of the continentia aedificia (the continuously built-up sprawl outside the city walls). In a more broad sense we can refer to the study region as a proasteion (mainly used in the Greek East) or suburbium (mainly used in the Latin West). The problem with these terms is that both also refer to the wider area surrounding an ancient city, including the part of the countryside defined by (elite) villae and suburban farms. This study further recognises a complex framework of different interacting ‘levels of urbanisation’, ranging from the monumental city centre to the desolate mountain slopes, with many different, though partially permeable, levels in between. While the boundaries between these zones were never definite, they appear to increasingly dissolve from Late Roman times onwards. The 7 th century AD earthquake would signify a breaking point for the urban texture in the centre of the city, but it appears that the Eastern Suburbium was already to a large extent abandoned in the preceding century. The demise of the quarter was the end station of a longer process, which included, consecutively, the gradual accumulation of waste, the abandonment of the (semi-) public southwestern quarter, the usurpation of older burial monuments, the dismantlement of derelict structures, the return of agricultural and pastoral activities in the area and the removal of the potting activities to a yet unknown location in the countryside. The final major intervention within the proasteion was the erection of an Early Byzantine church on the top of the eastern ridge, but also this building appears to have been emptied before it eventually collapsed in the 7 th century AD. The history of this quarter could be reconstructed in some detail from Classical/Hellenistic times to the so-called ‘Dark Ages’, thus covering a period of more than 1, 000 years. This study will hopefully serve as the onset for future research, as some (socio-economic) aspects deserve a more thorough <b>approach.</b> <b>Table</b> of content i Abstract - Öz (Turkish abstract) vii Introductory remarks xi Acknowledgements xiii PREFACE xv PART 1.
