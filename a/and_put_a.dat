After Aqil's victory at Hattin, the Ottoman authorities distanced themselves from the incident in their correspondence with Aqil, but he accepted their explanations {{with a grain of}} salt.

5|$|On {{the next}} morning, Wednesday, the new-moon day of Magha, Vikram 1607 (1551 CE) or 1620 (1564 CE) as per some sources, Rama again {{appeared}} to Tulsidas, {{this time as}} a child. Tulsidas was making sandalwood paste when a child came {{and asked for a}} sandalwood Tilaka (a religious mark on the forehead). This time Hanuman gave a hint to Tulsidas and he had a full view of Rama. Tulsidas was so charmed that he forgot about the sandalwood. Rama took the sandalwood paste <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> Tilaka himself on his forehead and Tulsidas' forehead before disappearing.|$|E

5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself.

As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
5|$|The killings shocked both Northern Ireland and Ireland <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> serious {{strain on}} Anglo-Irish relations.

The government held the view that the British Government had not done enough to stop sectarian assassinations in Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|By the late-19th century, Charing Cross {{was seen}} as being inconveniently placed. In 1889, the newly-formed London County Council's John Burns {{proposed}} that the station and its approach should be demolished, with a road bridge put in place. The idea gained support with in the council as it would allow the Strand to be widened <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> road crossing over the Thames that could bypass Whitehall. When the SECR went to Parliament asking for an act to strengthen the bridge in 1916, Burns suggested the station {{was in the wrong}} place and should be rebuilt {{on the south side of}} the Thames. The following year, an act was passed to reconstruct the bridge, with strict conditions about its appearance and a ban on enlarging the station building itself.|$|E

5|$|The game begins 500 {{years after}} Sir Daniel Fortesque's {{battle against the}} evil sorcerer Zarok in events from the {{previous}} game. In Kensington in the year 1886, a sorcerer named Lord Palethorn discovers Zarok's spellbook and casts its spell of raising the dead over the city of London. However, {{the pages of the}} book soon scatter across London and Palethorn gains a demon-like appearance as a result. The spell Palethorn casts once again brings Sir Daniel Fortesque, who was resting at a nearby museum, back to life. He is recruited by a professor named Hamilton Kift and his ghostly sidekick Winston (a play on Winston Churchill) to recover the pages of Zarok's spellbook <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> stop to Palethorn's plans. Along the way, they end up being joined by an ancient mummy princess named Kiya, Dan's future love interest.|$|E
5|$|The twelfth-century Renaissance {{resulted}} {{in the emergence of}} some major intellectual figures from Scotland. Probably the most significant was John Duns Scotus (c. 1265–1308), a major influence on late medieval religious thought. After the outbreak of the Wars of Independence in 1296, English universities were largely closed to Scots and continental universities became more significant. Just over a thousand Scots have been identified as attending continental universities between the twelfth century and 1410. Some Scottish scholars became teachers in continental universities, such as Walter Wardlaw (died 1387) and Laurence de Lindores (1372?–1437). This situation was transformed by the founding of the University of St Andrews in 1413, the University of Glasgow in 1450 and the University of Aberdeen in 1495. Initially, these institutions were designed for the training of clerics but would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law. In this period Scottish universities did not teach Greek, focused on metaphysics <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> largely unquestioning faith in the works of Aristotle. Those wanting to study for second degrees still needed to go elsewhere. Scottish scholars continued to study on the Continent and at English universities which reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Up to 60,000 Italian {{volunteers were}} now {{operating}} in Spain, and {{the removal of}} foreign nationals was discussed by the Non-Intervention Committee. Italy had made a declaration that it would stop Italian volunteers from fighting in Spain on 7 January 1937, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> moratorium on volunteers on 20 January, also agreeing to support limitations on the number of volunteers on the 25th. Italy continued to request that belligerent rights be given to the Nationalists and Republicans, so both would gain the right to search vessels for contraband, thus removing the need for naval patrols. This request was opposed by the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union. British recognition of Italian sovereignty over Abyssinia following the Second Italo-Abyssinian War was an important issue during Anglo-Italian discussions in August 1937. Following Eden's disagreement with Chamberlain and Lord Halifax, Leader of the House of Lords and influential politician, over the issue, any agreement recognising Italian sovereignty was postponed until after the planned shipping conference had taken place.|$|E

5|$|To {{celebrate}} Hitler's {{appointment as}} chancellor, Goebbels organized a torchlit parade in Berlin {{on the night}} of 30 January of an estimated 60,000 men, many in the uniforms of the SA and SS. The spectacle was covered by a live state radio broadcast, with commentary by longtime party member and future Minister of Aviation Hermann Göring. Goebbels was disappointed to not be given a post in Hitler's new cabinet. Bernhard Rust was appointed as Minister of Culture, the post Goebbels was expecting to receive. Like other NSDAP officials, Goebbels had to deal with Hitler's leadership style of giving contradictory orders to his subordinates, while placing them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. The NSDAP took advantage of the Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933, with Hindenburg passing the Reichstag Fire Decree the following day at Hitler's urging. This was the first of several pieces of legislation that dismantled democracy in Germany <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> totalitarian dictatorship—headed by Hitler—in its place. On 5 March, yet another Reichstag election took place, the last to be held before the defeat of the Nazis {{at the end of the}} Second World War. While the NSDAP increased their number of seats and percentage of the vote, it was not the landslide expected by the party leadership. Goebbels finally received Hitler's appointment to the cabinet, officially becoming head of the newly created Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda on 14 March.|$|E
