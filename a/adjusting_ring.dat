50|$|Whereas the Browning SA-22's barrel {{tightening}} {{is accomplished}} with an <b>adjusting</b> <b>ring</b> {{at the base}} of the barrel (and can easily be seen) where it butts up against the receiver - the Remington Model 241's barrel tightening mechanism uses a dual-sided nut (with an interrupted-screw thread in the interior and a full thread cut into the exterior) riding inside the threaded hole in the front of the receiver (only visible when the barrel is separated from the receiver). Selecting how deeply the dual-sided nut sits in the receiver (with the dual-sided nut's exterior thread meshing with the thread cut into the hole in the front of the receiver) controls how tightly the barrel fits against the receiver when it is attached (the rifle is assembled).|$|E
50|$|The Model 24 uses {{a barrel}} {{tightening}} method (needed {{due to the}} takedown nature of the design in which the barrel can {{be separated from the}} receiver) that is very close to that of the Browning SA-22. That tightening method uses an <b>adjusting</b> <b>ring</b> on {{the lower end of the}} barrel where it presses up against the receiver. The Model 241 uses a different method of tightening the barrel to the receiver (a dual-sided nut with an interrupted-screw threading rides inside the opening in the front of the receiver and, by selecting how deeply the nut sits in the receiver, it controls how tightly the barrel fits against the receiver when the barrel is fitted to the receiver. This mechanism of the Model 241 is not visible unless the barrel is separated from the receiver so that the opening in the front of the receiver can be viewed).|$|E
40|$|Reliable {{performances}} of high temperature and high pressure operating steam {{pressure relief valves}} (HTHP PRVs) are extremely important {{for the safety of}} nuclear power plants. It is still a challenge to accurately describe the dynamic performance of HTHP PRVs. In this study, the accuracy of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based modelling of the transient processes is examined. For one of the HTHP PRVs named DWPRV, the effects of different parameters on the dynamic performance were investigated by combining CFD simulation and experiments. In the simulation, the domain decomposition method (DDM) and the Grid Pre-deformation Method (GPM) were adopted to handle the moving disk geometry and the large mesh deformation. The effect of damping was also studied. It is confirmed that the use of CFD simulation can improve the design and settings of a HTHP PRV in a highly energetic service that is difficult to test due to safety reasons. For the DWPRV, {{it was found that the}} maximum flow rate occurs when the curtain area is 1. 18 times the throat area. The degree of superheat ranging from 0 C to 100 C has a negligible effect on the performance of DWPRV regardless of the changes in the material mechanical properties with operating temperatures. The reseating pressure increases linearly with the rise in the distance between the upper <b>adjusting</b> <b>ring</b> and the sealing face. The lower <b>adjusting</b> <b>ring</b> exhibits a weak effect on the reseating pressure.

40|$|AbstractA {{pressure}} {{safety valve}} (PSV) is widely used to open and relieve excess pressure from a pressure vessel/system. The rapid opening and reliable reclosing of a PSV are of great importance and are strongly determined by the coupling effect of the compressed spring and the fluid flow through the chamber region, which is mainly determined by the shape {{and the size of}} the disc and <b>adjusting</b> <b>ring.</b> In this paper, a multi-objective design optimization of a PSV is presented to trade-off the rapid opening and the reliable reclosing. The opening and reclosing operation is firstly estimated by comparing the spring force and the fluid forces, respectively, where flow force is obtained by using three-dimensional (3 -D) steady CFD simulation. Then, radial basis function (RBF) models are developed to approximate the two objective functions. A multi-objective optimization algorithm is then utilized to search the optimal design. Additionally, a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is carried out to identify the most important variables for the optimal design. The results show the influence of design variables on the opening and reclosing of the PSV, and give the optimal structure with desirable function. The analysis and optimization method used also shows a great potential to assist engineers in the preliminary design of PSVs, especially when the physical experiments are difficult to implement...|$|E

The polypeptide scaffold does not reveal any significant conformational change upon binding of the bulky substrates but in turn changes the conformations of the substrate rings either to avoid clashes between certain ring atoms or to <b>adjust</b> the <b>rings</b> involved in hydride transfer for providing an optimal catalytic efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{wireless}} {{mesh network}} (WMN) {{is an essential}} low-power solution to support ubiquitous broadband services. However, mesh networks face the power unfairness and through-put bottleneck issues. Compared to the users {{far away from the}} gateway, the users near the gateway need to relay more traffic and consume more power. This paper proposes a scalable ring-based WMN that can ensure power fairness among users by <b>adjusting</b> the <b>ring</b> widths. On top of the ring-based WMN, frequency planning is suggested to overcome the throughput bottleneck issue for the inner-ring users near the gateway, thereby making the system more scalable to accommodate more users and facilitating coverage extension. We also investigate the overall tradeoffs of the ring-based WMN in terms of power fairness, capacity, and coverage. An analytical model is developed to evaluate the throughput and power consumption of the ring-based WMN using carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) MAC protocol in the unsaturated situation. Then, a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem aiming to maximize cell capacity and coverage subject to the constraint of power fairness is formulated. Applying this optimization approach, we obtain the optimal number of rings and the associated ring widths of the ring-based WMN.

40|$|The {{performance}} of an innovative horizontal centrifugal decanter {{working in a}} continuous industrial olive oil extraction plant was evaluated. This decanter produces two streams a semi-solid residue (or pulp) formed from the wastewater and soft solids (i. e. without fragments of stone) and a husk rich in rigid solids from pit shells. Considering the phase separation obtained using this machine, and increasing number of restrictive laws on waste disposal, this decanter is of significant interest for use in olive oil extraction. The effects of varying the decanter centrifuge settings are documented and discussed. A correlation between the mass flow rate, water ring levels and conveyor-bowl differential speed {{with respect to the}} extracted efficiency, husk fat content and pulp water fat content was evaluated. The decanter studied was found to maintain high values of extraction efficiency between 86. 5 % and 90. 8 % for a large range of feed mass flow rates (4075 – 5820 kg h− 1) and for a large range of conveyor-bowl differential speeds (15. 5 – 26. 0 rpm).

30|$|In this paper, {{we study}} how to {{schedule}} the given number of mobile sensors {{to monitor the}} POIs such that the delay of the network is minimized. We discuss two scenarios. In the first scenario, with the determined start positions of mobile sensors, we propose the SSR algorithm. In the SSR, we generate trajectories by adding the POI which can make the current 2 MDkT be minimized. In the second scenario, with the undetermined start positions, we propose TSP-S and SSNOR algorithms. In the TSP-S, we first input all POIs into the PTAS algorithm of TSP and obtain an approximate TSP ring. Then, we divide and <b>adjust</b> the TSP <b>ring</b> into a set of trajectories. The SSNOR algorithm is a modification of the SSR. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms by extensive simulations.

40|$|Scientific {{validation}} of pharmacological actions of 7 Senegalese plants used in traditional medicine {{for the treatment}} of respiratory illness was carried out. Changes in contractility of isolated rat trachea were assessed in organ chambers. Rings were allowed to equilibrate for 60 min before experiments were carried out, during which time the resting tension was <b>adjusted,</b> as required. <b>Rings</b> were first exposed to methanolic plants extracts (10 - 2 and 10 - 1 mg/ml) or solvent.

Extracts from leaves of Guiera senegalensis, Melaleuca leucodendron and Hymenocardia acida elicited a significant dosedependant inhibition of the contractile agonist, suggesting further investigations on its chemical composition, the underlying mechanisms involved and its potential health value. However, in rings preincubated with extracts from Cymbopogon giganteus leaves and Salvadora persica roots, effect of the contractile agonist was not affected.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Overall wood {{density is}} a complex trait {{resulting}} from the interaction of three components: average earlywood density, average latewood density, and latewood proportion. In order {{to better understand the}} genetic control of wood density in juvenile Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), and to assess the utility of information on its components for improving the efficiency of selection for overall wood density, wood density components were examined in 15 -year-old trees of 60 open-pollinated families. Wood density traits were obtained on a ring-by-ring basis by X-ray densitometry of increment cores. In addition to providing information on overall wood density traits over the entire cores, these data made it possible to examine changes in wood density traits with increasing distance from the pith. Relationships between wood density traits and growth phenology, and their implications for tree breeding, were also examined. Overall core density showed strong genetic control (h = 0. 59) and a negative genetic correlation with bole volume (rA = - 0. 52). Wood density components were strongly genetically related with overall core density, but they were also strongly related among themselves and had lower heritability than overall core density. Therefore, information on density components would not be useful for improving the efficiency of selection for overall core density, or for reducing the negative correlated response on volume growth. It is possible, however, to substantially increase volume growth without loss in wood density, or even while slightly increasing wood density, when both traits are included in selection indices. Genetic control of overall core density and its components increased with age (ages 7 to 15). Overall core density and its components at age 15 were also strongly genetically correlated with their respective traits at all younger ages examined. Thus, early selection for overall core density at age 15 would be very effective. Including density components as secondary traits did not enhance the efficiency of early selection for overall core density. Ring density and its components (<b>adjusted</b> by <b>ring</b> size) followed different age trends, but the slopes of the trends did not differ significantly among families. A plateau in the earlywood density trend was observed around age 12 in some trees, and families varied in the proportion of trees having this plateau. This proportion was not correlated with overall core density or with growth traits at age 15. It is hypothesized that the plateau in earlywood density trend might be related to an earlier juvenile-mature transition age. Overall core density and all its components were negatively correlated with dates of cambial growth initiation and latewood transition, and positively correlated with date of cambial growth cessation. Thus, selection for higher wood density would cause a slight extension in the cambial growth period, and an earlier transition to latewood formation. Wood density was not genetically correlated with the date of budburst...|$|R
