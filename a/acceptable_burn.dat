40|$|The {{results of}} {{optimization}} calculations for CANDU reactors {{operating in the}} thorium cycle are presented in this paper. Calculations were performed to validate the feasibility of operating a heavy-water thermal neutron power reactor in a self-sufficient thorium cycle. Two modes of operation were considered in the paper: the mode of preliminary accumulation of 233 U in the reactor itself and the mode of operation in a self-sufficient cycle. For the mode of accumulation of 233 U, {{it was assumed that}} enriched uranium or plutonium was used as additional fissile material to provide neutrons for 233 U production. In the self-sufficient mode of operation, the mass and isotopic composition of heavy nuclei unloaded from the reactor should provide (after the removal of fission products) the value of the multiplication factor of the cell in the following cycle K> 1. Additionally, the task was to determine the geometry and composition of the cell for an <b>acceptable</b> <b>burn</b> up of 233 U. The results obtained demonstrate that the realization of a self-sufficient thorium mode for a CANDU reactor is possible without using new technologies. The main features of the reactor ensuring a self-sufficient mode of operation are a good neutron balance and moving of fuel through the active core...|$|E
40|$|Burning in savannas {{significantly}} impacts {{the physical}} environment and has recently been recognized for the significant role it could play in climate change by releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases (Menaut et al., 1991). This is particularly true for West African savannas which cover approximately 3 x 10 ⁶ km², {{one of the largest}} contiguous extents of savannas in the world. Recently {{it has been suggested that}} 2. 4 - 4. 2 gt C (gigatons of carbon) are released by savanna burning annually (Hall and Scurlock, 1990). Even with this impact our knowledge of tropical vegetation systems is limited (Sadar et aID, 1990). One method of monitoring vegetation over large regions is using satellite remote sensing. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is well suited for the task due to its high temporal resolution (daily), large area coverage (2700 km swath width) and spectral channel availability (nearinfrared band useful for monitoring vegetation). In this study AVHRR data for four burn seasons were analyzed to determine the origin, spread and extent of burning for The Gambia. The accuracy of the assessment was verified using coincident higher spatial resolution (30 m) Thematic Mapper (TM) data and field assessments. The burn extents calculated using a traditionally classified AVHRR image were within 11 % of those calculated by the TM. Further a linear mixture model was applied to the AVHRR imagery to determine if burn estimates could be improved. It was found that by thresholding mixture model results, derived using AVHRR bands 1, 2 and 3, <b>acceptable</b> <b>burn</b> estimates were produced. The mixture model estimates were consistently higher than the TM estimations, particularly for agricultural areas...|$|E

40|$|This work is {{oriented}} on {{the preparation}} of high-voluable sulphate binder based on gypsum waste. One of the potential mineral resources in Moravia is Pregips chemical gypsum, produced by Precheza. This is the raw material, which is characterized by high purity, high quality and is economically <b>acceptable.</b> Beta <b>burned</b> gypsum plaster from this, however, need to modify due to suppression of the high needs of water mixing, which is determined by its morphology. The need for mixing water has a large impact {{on the strength of}} gypsum binders. Therefore it is necessary to find a suitable additive, which would reduce the coefficient of water in {{the preparation of}} porridge normal consistency...|$|R
5000|$|Subcritical {{reactors}} {{have been}} proposed both {{as a means of}} generating electric power and as a means of transmutation of nuclear waste, so the gain is twofold. However, the costs for construction, safety and maintenance of such complex installations are expected to be very high, let alone the amount of research needed to develop a practical design (see above). There exist cheaper and reasonably safe waste management concepts, such as the transmutation in fast-neutron reactors. However, the solution of a subcritical reactor might be favoured for a better public acceptance [...] - [...] it is considered more <b>acceptable</b> to <b>burn</b> the waste than to bury it {{for hundreds of thousands of}} years. For future waste management, a few transmutation devices could be integrated into a large-scale nuclear program, hopefully increasing only slightly the overall costs.|$|R
40|$|Biomass burning is an {{important}} ecosystem process in southern Africa, with significant implications for regional and global atmospheric chemistry and biogeochemical cycles. In this paper, representative Landsat path-row scene locations, distributed over southern Africa, were used to quantify the area burned and to understand the coupled role of the timing {{and the extent of}} burning on regional emissions. The total area burned and the scar size distribution were found to vary between semi-arid and humid scenes and dry and average rainfall years. Analysis of images from the start and end of the burning season resulted in a modest underestimate of the annual area burned, as compared to using a monthly time-series approach. However, at the regional level the start/end method is likely to yield <b>acceptable</b> annual <b>burned</b> area estimates and total carbon dioxide estimates. On the other hand, combustion factors and emission factors vary sufficiently during the burning season to result in large errors in emission estimates of products of incomplete combustion, when using the start/end method. This study indicates that in southern Africa, the timing in addition to the extent of burning must be considered and that time-series satellite burned area products are needed to quantify pyrogenic emissions accurately...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{tremendous}} advances in burns care {{over the past}} 50 years. Much of this, but not all, {{can be attributed to}} basic science and clinically related research. Out of the best centres in the world, centres that are fully funded and richly resourced, best practice guidelines result in impressive outcomes {{not only in terms of}} survival but also in terms of a quality of survival. Indeed the remaining clinical challenges in these centres are the elderly, the inhalational burns, and the very extensive burns. There are however other challenges when looking at burns care in a global context and in particular is the provision of even minimal standards of <b>acceptable</b> care for <b>burns</b> patients in many parts of the world. Whilst the justification for research funding in the wealthy countries becomes increasingly esoteric, for example looking at the immunology of face transplantation, the global health challenges of burns care still remain. Perhaps, the greatest research challenge in burns care in the 21 st century lies not in furthering our understanding of the phenomenon we observe but the global application of the knowledge we already possess...|$|R
40|$|As acute burn {{patients}} have experienced increasing survival rates, {{the number of}} patients who need specific care due to aberrant scarring is also increasing. the burned skin often responds with fibrotic tissue proliferation, which can lead to a hypertrophic scar or a keloid. Non-physiologic scars are mostly not <b>acceptable</b> for the <b>burn</b> patient. Intradermal and topical therapy in burns comprise the treatment of the skin injury and its possible texture, elasticity and color alterations with the aid of active substances that result in fibroblastic modulation. An alteration of cytokine levels may mediate these effects, and evidences suggest that keloid scar formation may be mediated, in part, by deranged growth factor activity, including that of transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta(1). the addition of tamoxifen, a non-steroidal anti-estrogen, usually used in breast cancer, to standard treatment may lead to improved wound healing in keloids by decreasing the expression of TGF-beta(1), with the consequent inhibitions of both fibroblast proliferation and collagen production. Topical tamoxifen citrate chemical treatment has been shown to improve scarring. However, prospective studies must be undertaken to validate the inclusion of tamoxifen into standard clinical practice.

40|$|Analysis of the {{uncertainty}} quantification related to nuclear safety margins applied to the nuclear reactor is an important concept to prevent future radioactive accidents. The nuclear fuel performance code may involve the tolerance level determined by traditional deterministic models producing <b>acceptable</b> results at <b>burn</b> cycles under 62 GWd/MTU. The behavior of nuclear fuel can simulate applying a series of material properties under irradiation and physics models to calculate the safety limits. In this study, theoretical predictions of nuclear fuel failure under transient conditions investigate extended radiation cycles at 75 GWd/MTU, considering the behavior of fuel rods in light-water reactors under reactivity accident conditions. The fuel pellet can melt due to the quick increase of reactivity during a transient. Large power excursions in the reactor {{are the subject of}} interest bringing to a treatment that is known as the Fuchs-Hansen model. The point kinetic neutron equations show similar characteristics of non-linear differential equations. In this investigation, the multivariate logistic regression is employed to a probabilistic forecast of fuel failure. A comparison of computational simulation and experimental results was acceptable. The experiments carried out use the pre-irradiated fuels rods subjected to a rapid energy pulse which exhibits the same behavior during a nuclear accident. The propagation of uncertainty utilizes the Wilk's formulation. The variables chosen as essential to failure prediction were the fuel burnup, the applied peak power, the pulse width, the oxidation layer thickness, and the cladding type...|$|R
5000|$|Heavy Armour Tank Wise Duck - A huge weapon-laden mecha that Studio Nue {{says is a}} {{homage to}} the HWR-00-Mk. II Destroid Monster of Macross. Wise Duck is piloted by an entire crew, {{consisting}} of Gonzalles (Commander) (voiced by Daisuke Gōri), Arvin (Combat) (voiced by Shigeru Nakahara), Ricky (Gunner) (Voiced by Kōichi Tōchika), Thomas (Pilot) (voiced by Takehito Koyasu), and Herald (Sonar/Communications) (voiced by Shūichi Ikeda). This mecha pays some homage to the harder real robots, like Dougram. The Wise Duck teams is also highly reminiscent off the Cyclops Team of Gundam 0080. In the storyline, Arvin is a rookie military officer who, it turns out, has moral objections to some of war's uglier aspects, such as the necessity of having to kill very young pilots and especially {{the idea that the}} army Arvin belongs to considers it <b>acceptable</b> to <b>burn</b> a village of innocent people just so their enemy cannot hide. Depending on the player's actions in one of the fights, there are two possible story paths from here. In the first story path, Gonzales, Arvin's commander, abruptly changes his mind and decides to rebel against those cruel orders, because they would result in the massacre of civilians, which would necessarily include a little girl to whom Arvin earlier gave chocolate and who smiled at him. When Goldibus invades the Earth and cites humanity's hatred and warmongering as his reason, Arvin uses the little girl's smile as an example of something on Earth worthy to protect, inspiring him {{and the rest of the}} Wise Duck crew to defeat Goldibus. In the ending, Arvin is then shown as an older man over ten years later, the lone survivor among his crew, visiting the rusted Wise Duck, having heard that the village girl married someone and became a mother, and reflecting that he and his crew won against the enemy as humans. In the second story path, the crew [...] "wakes up" [...] many years into the future, in which humans are dominated by super-intelligent apes who dug up robots from the past. After the last few fights, the player abruptly learns that Arvin is in fact dead, having dreamed the whole thing as he was dying. This is because Gonazales shot Arvin for supposedly running from the enemy, and Thomas expresses regret that Arvin and his morals were in the wrong place, hoping that Arvin will dream and [...] "wake up" [...] in a time when there is no war.|$|R
