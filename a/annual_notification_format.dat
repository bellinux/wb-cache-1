40|$|Abstract Background: During {{the last}} two decades, {{tuberculosis}} (TB) has once again emerged as a significant public health problem in Western Countries. The {{aim of this study}} is to describe the epidemiology of TB in Italy in the last fifteen years. All routine information sources available (<b>annual</b> <b>notifications,</b> mortality and hospital discharges) were used, and attempts to investigate gender and geographical differences were made. Methods: Age-standardized <b>annual</b> <b>notification,</b> mortality and hospital discharge rates were calculated. Time trends of <b>annual</b> <b>notifications,</b> mortality and hospital discharges for TB were modelled through Poisson regression, and whenever necessary, negative binomial regression. Results: The analysis of the temporal trend of TB using the three indicators shows an increase until the middle of 1990 s and a following decrease. TB is more frequent in men than in women, with a decremental North to South gradient. There are important geographical and gender differences of the TB decline in Italy, since the decrease of TB frequency is more pronounced in men than in women and it is less evident in the central and, to a lesser extent, the southern parts of the country. Discussion: Italian guidelines for TB control, which are largely consistent with the international recommendations for low-incidence countries, need to be fully implemented throughout the entire country in order to reach the ultimate goal of disease eradication. Given the high number of TB cases among foreignborn persons, a strong public health commitment on TB control for immigrants, which includes screening, prophylaxis and treatment, is urgently needed...|$|R

We aimed to describe and account for trends in the incidence of OA in the West Midlands, UK using <b>annual</b> <b>notification</b> data from the SHIELD voluntary surveillance scheme over the period 1991 - 2011. METHODS All notifications to the SHIELD database between January 1991 and December 2011 were identified, along with patients' demographic data, occupations, causative agents and confirmatory tests. <b>Annual</b> <b>notifications</b> were scaled to give an annual count per million workers, giving a measure of incidence, and also standardised against those of bakers' asthma. Non-parametric analyses were undertaken between annual incidence and time (years) for common causative agents using (1) a negative binomial regression univariate model and (2) a logistic regression model calculating annual reporting ORs. A step-change analysis was used to examine time points at which there were marked reductions in incidence.

40|$|In two {{national}} surveys of tuberculosis notifications in England conducted in 1978 / 79 and 1983 the estimated <b>annual</b> <b>notification</b> {{rates for the}} Indian subcontinent (Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi) ethnic groups were considerably higher than the rate for the white ethnic group. The mean annual decline in rates between the surveys appeared to be greater for the Indian and the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups, 15 % and 16 % respectively, than for the white ethnic group (7 %). Data from two small sample population surveys, the National Dwelling and Housing Survey in 1978 and the Labour Force Survey in 1983, were {{used to calculate the}} rates. However, comparison of the estimates for the population of Indian subcontinent ethnic origin in England from these surveys revealed discrepancies between them. Additional information from the Labour Force Survey on the year of first entry to the United Kingdom (UK) permitted the calculation of new estimates for the 1978 population, and based on these estimates the <b>annual</b> <b>notification</b> rates for 1978 / 79 were 287 per 100, 000 for the Indian and 286 per 100, 000 for the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups. The rates for 1983 were 178 and 169 respectively, and the mean annual decline between the surveys was 11 % for the Indian and 12 % for the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups. There were important changes in the characteristics of the population of Indian subcontinent ethnic origin in England between 1978 and 1983, and therefore the rates for both surveys have been standardised by the method of direct standardisation to a common reference population. Standardizing for year of entry to the UK, place of birth (UK or abroad), age, and sex reduced the mean annual decline in the notification rate to 4 % for the Indian and 9 % for the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups. The much greater reduction in the rate of decline in the Indian ethnic group is due to the substantial decline between the surveys in the proportion of recent immigrants, the group with the highest <b>annual</b> <b>notification</b> rate, in that population. Future trends will continue to be influenced by immigration patterns, but it will also be important to monitor the rates among the increasing proportion of the population born in the UK or resident in England for more than five years...|$|R

DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of TB data from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) on TB in children (under 15 years of age) during the 10 -year period, 2003 - 2012. RESULTS: TB notifications in Australia {{during the study period}} included 538 children (range, 37 - 66 cases per year), representing 4. 6 % of the total TB case load during the period (range, 3. 8 %- 5. 8 % each year). Place of birth was recorded for 524 patients (97. 4 %); of these, 230 (43. 9 %) were born in Australia, 294 (56. 1 %) overseas. The average <b>annual</b> <b>notification</b> rate was 1. 31 (95 % CI, 1. 20 - 1. 43) cases per 100 000 child population. The rate was higher for overseas-born than for Australian-born children (9. 57 [95 % CI, 8. 51 - 10. 73] v 0. 61 [95 % CI, 0. 53 - 0. 69] cases per 100 000 children. The overall rate was highest among those aged 0 - 4 years. The <b>annual</b> <b>notification</b> rate was three times higher for Indigenous children than for non-Indigenous Australian-born children. Of 427 patients (79. 4 % of total) for whom the method of case detection was recorded, 37. 0 % were detected by contact screening, 8. 7 % by post-arrival immigration screening, and 54. 3 % by passive case detection. Pulmonary TB was the most common diagnostic classification (64. 7 % of patients). The most common risk factors were close contact with a TB case and recent residence in a country with a high incidence of TB. Treatment outcomes were satisfactory; 89. 4 % of children had completed treatment or were cured. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of paediatric TB in Australia is low but has not changed over the past decade. The highest rates are among children born overseas, emphasising the important role of immigration screening as Australia aspires to eliminate TB. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

To determine if this increase is real, as opposed to a surveillance artefact, we examined both available notification (1980 – 2003) and hospitalization data (1995 – 2003). The similarity in the temporal pattern of increasing hospitalizations for campylobacteriosis, with that of notifications, is suggestive that this increase is indeed real. Although some risk factors for this disease have been identified (e. g. uncooked poultry consumption) it is unclear what the likely causes of the increasing rates are.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{national}} survey of tuberculosis notifications in England and Wales {{was carried out in}} 1993 to determine the notification rate of tuberculosis and the trends in the occurrence of disease by ethnic group in comparison with the findings of similar surveys in 1978 / 79, 1983, and 1988. The prevalence of HIV infection in adults notified with tuberculosis in the survey period was also estimated. METHODS: Clinical, bacteriological, and sociodemographic information was obtained on all newly notified cases of tuberculosis in England and Wales during the six months from 2 January to 2 July 1993. The prevalence of HIV infection in 16 - 54 year old patients with tuberculosis notified throughout 1993 was assessed using "unlinked anonymous" testing supplemented by matching of the register of patients with tuberculosis with that of patients with AIDS reported to the PHLS AIDS centre. <b>Annual</b> <b>notification</b> rates were calculated using population estimates from the 1993 Labour Force Survey. RESULTS: A total of 2706 newly notified patients was eligible for inclusion in the survey of whom 2458 were previously untreated the comparable figures for 1988 were 2408 and 2163. The number of patients of white ethnic origin decreased from 1142 (53 %) in 1988 to 1088 (44 %) in 1993 whereas those of patients of Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi (Indian subcontinent (ISC)) ethnic origin increased from 843 (39 %) in 1988 to 1014 (41 %) and those of "other" (non-white, non-ISC) ethnic origins increased from 178 (8 %) to 356 (14 %). The largest increase was seen in the black African ethnic group from 37 in 1988 to 171 in 1993. Forty nine per cent of patients had been born abroad and the highest rates were seen in those who had recently arrived in this country. The overall <b>annual</b> <b>notification</b> rate for previously untreated tuberculosis in England and Wales increased between 1988 and 1993 from 8. 4 to 9. 2 per 100, 000 population. The rate declined in the white, Indian, and black Caribbean ethnic groups and increased in all other groups. In the white group the rate of decline has slowed since the last survey: in several age groups the rates were higher in 1993 than 1988 but the numbers in these groups were small. Thirty six (4. 1 %) of the 882 previously untreated respiratory cases were resistant to isoniazid and three (0. 3 %) to isoniazid and rifampicin. Sixty two (2. 3 %) adults aged 16 - 54 years were estimated to be HIV-infected. Evidence of under-reporting of HIV positive tuberculosis patients was found. CONCLUSIONS: The number of cases and <b>annual</b> <b>notification</b> rate for previously untreated tuberculosis increased between 1988 and 1993. Although the decline in rates in the white population has continued, the rate of decline has slowed. The high rates in the ISC ethnic group population have continued to decline since 1988 whereas rates in the black African group have increased. An increased proportion of cases were found among people born abroad, particularly those recently arrived in this country. In previously untreated cases the level of drug resistance remains low and multi-drug resistance is rare. A small proportion of adults with tuberculosis were infected with HIV but there may be selective undernotification of tuberculosis in these patients. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{number of}} interruptions people {{experience}} {{on a daily}} basis has grown considerably over the last decade and this growth has not shown any signs of subsiding. In fact, with the exponential growth of mobile computing, interruptions are permeating the user experience. Systems must be developed to manage interruptions by reasoning about ideal timings of interactions and determining appropriate <b>notification</b> <b>formats.</b> In this work, an architecture for a cloud-based interruption management system for mobile device users is presented. The system draws from rich contextual information from the mobile device (i. e., user, task and environment dimensions) and real-time observations of the user's activities and then reasons about ideal times to interact with the user. The reasoning component (interruption algorithm) is situated in the cloud and implemented using a novel machine learning technique (an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System). This research addresses the complex problem of determining the precise time to interact with a mobile device user and in so doing aims to reduce the negative aspects of interruptions. This paper also presents a new interruption taxonomy built on an existing framework, and a report on the current prototype developed...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} selected socioeconomic {{variables for}} incidence of tuberculosis and its rate {{of changes that}} might be relevant {{for the design of}} appropriate prevention and control programs. Retrospective ecological analysis was done to examine the association between eight socioeconomic measures from the 1992 census and both the average rate and the rate of change of standardized <b>annual</b> <b>notification</b> rates for tuberculosis from 1988 to 1997 for each of the 23 wards in Tokyo. Multivariate analysis identified the proportion of households with livelihood aid (p< 0. 001), number of public bath per 100, 000 person (p< 0. 001), population density (p= 0. 012), and proportion of households below standard house space (p= 0. 024) as variables positively associated with average tuberculosis notification rates. The rate of change was negatively correlated with three variables; proportion of owner occupied households (p= 0. 001), number of tatami (living space) per capita (p= 0. 021), proportion of households with livelihood aid (p= 0. 038). The results showed there were certain clear socioeconomic risk factors in tuberculosis transmission, and that {{it might be possible to}} investigate the relation between the rate of change and each socioeconomic risk factor effectively with this method. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesQ fever {{has been}} {{reported}} worldwide; however, {{there was almost no}} official report of Q fever in Korea. In this study, we describe the current status of human Q fever occurrence in Korea. MethodsDemographic data of Q fever patients were collected from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System from 2006 to 2011. Case investigation reports from regional public health departments were used for additional information, like risk factors and clinical manifestation, of the patients since 2008. ResultsThere were 65 serologically confirmed cases during the study period. The <b>annual</b> <b>notification</b> rate of Q fever was 0. 22 cases per million persons. The majority of cases were men (87. 7 %), adults (98. 5 %), and urban inhabitants (67. 7 %). Relevant exposures to risk factors were identified in 45. 7 % of patients. The most common symptoms of acute Q fever were fever (89. 3 %), myalgia (67. 9 %) and asthenia (53. 6 %). Two cases with endocarditis were identified in chronic Q fever. ConclusionThis study suggests that Q fever has a low endemicity in Korea. However, management and research at national level is required for prevention of a future epidemic...|$|R
