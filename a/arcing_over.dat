50|$|<b>Arcing</b> <b>over</b> {{some types}} of printed circuit boards, {{possibly}} due to cracks of the traces or {{the failure of a}} solder, renders the affected insulating layer conductive as the dielectric is combusted due to the high temperatures involved. This conductivity prolongs the arcing due to cascading failure of the surface.|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, Goude photographed Kim Kardashian for Paper magazine. When {{the photos}} were released, their {{popularity}} and topicality {{were said to}} [...] "break the Internet," [...] just as the magazine's accompanying caption indicated. One of the images was a recreation of Goude’s earlier work “Carolina Beaumont”. Like the earlier image, the new photo features Kardashian holding an exploding champagne bottle, with the spray <b>arcing</b> <b>over</b> her head and landing in a champagne glass balanced on her butt. Others have drawn the comparison between these photos and depictions of Baartman, seeing {{them as part of}} the continuing history of the exploitation of black women's bodies.|$|E
50|$|On 25 May 2017, Mandžukić {{signed a}} {{contract}} extension that would keep him at the club until 2020. On 3 June, Mandžukić started in the Champions League Final. He scored the equalising goal in the 27th minute, just seven minutes after Cristiano Ronaldo's goal gave Real Madrid the lead. Mandžukić chested down a ball from Gonzalo Higuaín and hooked the ball over his shoulder from 15 yd, which <b>arced</b> <b>over</b> Keylor Navas in net. The goal was heralded {{as one of the}} best goals ever scored in a Champions League final, and was compared to Zinedine Zidane's goal in the 2002 final for Real Madrid; but Juventus were ultimately defeated 4-1.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "pin router" [...] {{accessory}} is used. A pin router {{originally had}} a pin {{in the table}} that would trace the part and hung the router motor on an [...] "over arm" [...] that rose from one edge or corner of the router table, <b>arced</b> <b>over</b> the table, and descends directly (coaxially) towards the pin. This was a big safety concern as people's hand were very accessible to the cutter. In 1976 C.R. Onsrud patented the Inverted Pin Router that reversed the two and mounted the motor {{under the table and}} the guide pin on the [...] "over arm". A template (with an interior recess on the top face removed) is affixed to the workpiece, and the guide pin is lowered into this recess. The template is then moved against the pin, carrying the workpiece against the spinning router bit and creating a duplicate of the patterned part.|$|R
25|$|Mandžukić's {{second season}} with Juventus was {{particularly}} notable, {{as he was}} often played out of position by the club's manager Massimiliano Allegri; throughout the 2016–17 season, he primarily served as a left winger, {{rather than as an}} out and out striker, a position which he normally occupied in the past. Although his goalscoring rate decreased, he drew praise in the media for his work-rate, versatility, consistency, and for the overall high quality of his performances in this new role. On 25 May 2017, Mandžukić signed a contract extension that would keep him at the club until 2020. On 3 June, Mandžukić started in the Champions League Final. He scored the equalising goal in the 27th minute, just seven minutes after Cristiano Ronaldo's goal gave Real Madrid the lead.

50|$|On the outside, {{the arena}} is a rounded {{rectangle}} over the indented lower level, with a hump-shaped roof <b>arcing</b> <b>over</b> the long {{sides of the}} building. Inside, the seating is much higher on the sidelines than in the endzones. However, the most recognizable features of the arena are the corner walls which divide the sidelines from the end zones, and feature large ram's horn patterns on each one, radiating out from the near corners. The basketball court floor also features the ram's horns pattern, created {{with the use of}} two different colors of hardwood (the horns use the darker shade). A video scoreboard hangs {{from the center of the}} rafters, and is surrounded by banners as well as retractable basketball hoops for use during practice. Two auxiliary scoreboards are located on opposite corner walls (to the right when standing on either sideline).|$|E
5000|$|The coaster sends riders 85 ft high up {{the lift}} hill {{alongside}} Wicked roller coaster, then into a smooth 1/3 right turn. Riders {{get a glimpse}} of the Wild Mouse and the Spider roller coasters before heading into a fast, twisting plummet to the ground, then through two 65 ft High-G inversions and two helix turns. The first helix turn is very large, <b>arcing</b> <b>over</b> the [...] "bridge" [...] or elevated part of the queue, then up and through the second loop. After that the train passes just over the station's roof, then down and around, turning diagonally between the two loops into the G-inducing helix back to the station. This helix is what some people call the 'slanted spiral' or the 'upward-downward helix,' because it turns downward, upward, then downward again at equal angles into a large turn that leads back to the station, giving the entire element a 'slanted' look.|$|E
50|$|Juventus {{dominated}} possession in {{the opening}} 19 minutes of the match, and had three major chances to score. Gonzalo Higuaín had two shots on goal that were easily saved by Keylor Navas, while Miralem Pjanić had a more dangerous chance that Navas dived to push wide to his right. Despite the scoring chances, {{as well as the}} closing down of Real Madrid's counterattacks in the midfield, Cristiano Ronaldo scored the first goal of the match in the 20th minute; Dani Carvajal played a one-two on the right with Ronaldo before passing across for him to shoot low to the left corner of the net, which deflected in off the right foot of Leonardo Bonucci. Juventus responded with a goal seven minutes later to bring the score to 1-1. Mario Mandžukić chested down a ball from Higuaín and hooked the ball over his shoulder from 15 yd, which <b>arced</b> <b>over</b> Navas. The goal was heralded {{as one of the best}} goals ever scored in a Champions League final and was compared to Zinedine Zidane's goal in the 2002 final for Real Madrid. Juventus remained in control through the end of the first half, while Real Madrid conceded two yellow cards for defenders Sergio Ramos and Dani Carvajal.|$|R

50|$|The third Test decider {{was also}} {{successful}} and the Ashes regained. The 21-17 score {{did not reflect}} Great Britain’s superiority as they scored five tries to one, but were heavily penalised by the referee. Again, Millward rose to the occasion: with approximately five-minutes to go he scored the match and series winning try on the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). The try resulted from a thrust through the middle by the second rows, first by Jimmy Thompson and then a bust by Doug Laughton, who then delivered a brilliant pass to Millward in space; Millward took the pass at pace and in turn then outstripped the opposition defence in an <b>arcing</b> run of <b>over</b> 40-yards to score. He also kicked three goals in the game.|$|R
40|$|ARC is a {{collaborative}} performance drawing process generated from written instructions. The concept of ARC grew from the visualisation of communication technology, {{the image of}} a signal beaming from its source (in one location) and <b>arcing</b> <b>over</b> to its receiver in another place. These instructions are action relayed collaborations, hence the acronym ARC. The ARCs are transmitted by hand-written or typed notes, telephone, SMS messages, email and Skype.

40|$|The Environmental Effects Group of NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is {{conducting}} {{research into the}} effects of plasma interaction with high voltage solar arrays. These high voltage solar arrays are being developed for a direct drive Hall Effect Thruster propulsion system. A direct drive system configuration will reduce power system mass by eliminating a conventional power-processing unit. The Environmental Effects Group has configured two large vacuum chambers to test different high-voltage array concepts in a plasma environment. Three types of solar arrays have so far been tested, an International Space Station (ISS) planar array, a Tecstar planar array, and a Tecstar solar concentrator array. The plasma environment was generated using a hollow cathode plasma source, which yielded densities between 10 (exp 6) - 10 (exp 7) per cubic centimeter and electron temperatures of 0. 5 - 1 eV. Each array was positioned in this plasma and biased in the - 500 to + 500 volt range. The current collection was monitored continuously. In addition, the characteristics of <b>arcing,</b> snap <b>over,</b> and other features, were recorded. Analysis of the array performance indicates a time dependence associated with the current collection {{as well as a}} tendency for "conditioning" over a large number of runs. Mitigation strategies, to reduce parasitic current collection, as well as arcing, include changing cover-glass geometry and layout as well as shielding the solar cell edges. High voltage performance data for each of the solar array types tested will be presented. In addition, data will be provided to indicate the effectiveness of the mitigation techniques...|$|R
40|$|An {{ion engine}} is a plasma {{thruster}} which produces thrust by extracting ions from the plasma and accelerating them to high velocity with an electrostatic field. The ions are then neutralized {{and leave the}} engine as high velocity neutral particles. The advantages of ion engines are high specific impulse and efficiency {{and their ability to}} operate over a wide range of input powers. In comparison with other electric thrusters, the ion engine has higher efficiency and specific impulse than thermal electric devices such as the arcjet, microwave, radio frequency, and laser heated thrusters and can operate at much lower current levels than the MPD thruster. However, the thrust level for an ion engine may be lower than a thermal electric thruster of the same operating power, consistent with its higher specific impulse, and therefore ion engines are best suited for missions which can tolerate longer duration propulsive phases. The critical issue for the ion engine is lifetime, since the prospective missions may require operation for several thousands of hours. The critical components of the ion engine, with respect to engine lifetime, are the screen and accelerating grid structures. Typically, these are large metal screens that must support a large voltage difference and maintain a small gap between them. Metallic whisker growth, distortion, and vibration can lead to <b>arcing,</b> and <b>over</b> {{a long period of time}} ion sputtering will erode the grid structures and change their geometry. In order to study the effects of long time operation of the grid structure, we are developing computer codes based on the particle-in-cell (PIC) technique and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) diagnostic techniques to study the physical processes which control the performance and lifetime of the grid structures...|$|R
5000|$|In 1992 {{they formed}} the folk-pop band in Sydney with Dobson on vocals and guitar; Manning on guitar, bouzouki and vocals; Alex Hewetson on double bass and Antero Ceschin on drums. In 1993 they {{independently}} released their first extended play, Leonardo's Bride, with four tracks. The self-titled track provided the band's name based on Leonardo da Vinci. Drum Medias Craig Mathieson felt the track [...] "is spangly acoustic pop. Abby Dobson <b>arcing</b> her voice <b>over</b> luminous acoustic guitar. It sets a holding pattern they adhere to". Late that year Mark Howard replaced Hewetson on bass guitar and David Sanders replaced Ceschin on drums. They added John Gauci on keyboards and Hammond organ. By 1994 the line-up of Dobson, Manning, and Gauci {{were joined by}} Patrick Wong (aka Patrick Hyndes) on bass guitar and Jon Howell on drums. In October 1994 they issued their second EP, Temperamental Friend, on PolyGram's label Id. James Mayson of Drum Media felt they [...] "drive a fairly quirky acoustic highway and manage {{to pick up some}} strange hitchhikers on the way ... they ride a carousel of emotions". In 1995 they toured supporting The Badloves in Australia and Big Geraniums in Ireland.|$|R
40|$|The Photovoltaic Array Space Power Plus Diagnostics (PASP Plus) {{experiment}} {{was developed by}} the Air Force's Phillips Laboratory with support from NASA's Lewis Research Center. It was launched on the Advanced Photovoltaic and Electronics EXperiments (APEX) satellite on August 3, 1994 into a 70 degree inclination, 363 km by 2550 km elliptical orbit. This orbit allows the investigation of space plasma effects on high-voltage operation (leakage current at positive voltages and arcing at negative voltages) in the perigee region. PASP Plus is testing twelve solar arrays. There are four planar Si arrays: an old standard type (used as a reference), the large-cell Space Station Freedom (SSF) array, a thin 'APSA' array, and an amorphous Si array. Next are three GaAs on Ge planar arrays and three new material planar arrays, including InP and two multijunction types. Finally, there are two concentrator arrays: a reflective-focusing Mini-Cassegrainian and a Fresnel-lens focusing Mini-Dome. PASP Plus's diagnostic sensors include: Langmuir probe to measure plasma density, an electrostatic analyzer (ESA) to measure the 30 eV to 30 KeV electron/ion spectra and determine vehicle negative potential during positive biasing, and a transient pulse monitor (TPM) to characterize the arcs that occur during the negative biasing. Through positive biasing of its test arrays, PASP Plus investigated the snapover phenomenon, which took place over the range of + 100 to + 300 V. It was found that array configurations where the interconnects are shielded from the space plasma (i. e., the concentrators or arrays with 'wrap-through' connectors) have lower leakage current. The concentrators exhibited negligible leakage current over the whole range up to + 500 V. In the case of two similar GaAs on Ge arrays, the one with 'wrap-through' connectors had lower leakage current than the one with conventional interconnects. Through negative biasing, PASP Plus investigated the arcing rates of its test arrays. The standard Si array, with its old construction (exposed rough-surface interconnects), <b>arced</b> significantly <b>over</b> a wide voltage and plasma-density range. The other arrays arced at very low rates, mostly at voltages greater than - 350 V and plasma densities near or greater than 10 (exp 5) /cm(exp - 3). AS expected according to theory, arcing was more prevalent when array temperatures were cold (based on biasing in eclipse) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{report by}} Monsignor Walter S. Carroll (see above), {{who had just}} {{returned}} from Allied headquarters in Algeria, that he had been informed “very confidentially” that the bombing was due to an American pilot who had lost his way and that another American pilot had reported seeing an Allied plane dropping its load on the Vatican, correctly represented opinion at Allied headquarters, Algeria, at the time. On November 8, 1943, Harold Macmillan, the then resident British Minister in Algiers, informed the British Foreign Office in a “Most Secret” telegram: “I think we probably did bomb the Vatican.” On the night in question one of seven British Boston bombers, which had been in operation just north of Rome at the time the Vatican was bombed, developed engine trouble and dropped its bombs through clouds over an unknown location in order to lighten its load and return to base. These it was thought must have been the bombs which fell on the Vatican. But at the Foreign Office it was noted that it had been a clear and cloudless night over Rome when the Vatican was bombed. And a subsequent confidential Air Ministry investigation into the incident established that the impaired Boston had actually dropped its bombs <b>over</b> <b>Arce,</b> some fifty miles southeast of Rome, and that neither it nor any other British aircraft in operation that night was responsible. The American pilot who witnessed the bombing probably saw the Savoia-Marchetti aircraft which, from a distance, is not dissimilar to the Merlin Baltimore light bomber frequently used over Italy, and mistook it for an Allied aircraft. The weight of evidence, therefore, points to Farinacci, who, as seen, never denied it.|$|R
