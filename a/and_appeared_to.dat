5|$|The {{plan was}} successful. Many of the Allied officers, {{including}} the Tsar's aides and the Austrian Chief of Staff Franz von Weyrother, strongly supported an immediate attack <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> sway Tsar Alexander. Kutuzov's plan to retreat {{further to the}} Carpathian region was rejected, and the Allied forces soon fell into Napoleon's trap.|$|E
5|$|Although their ranges overlap substantially, {{hybridisation}} between goldcrests and firecrests {{seems to}} be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in aviary studies in which a female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male firecrest, the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be poorly adapted compared to the parent species.|$|E
5|$|In {{between his}} various duties and responsibilities, Nansen had {{continued}} to take skiing holidays when he could. In February 1930, aged 68, he took a short break in the mountains with two old friends, who noted that Nansen was slower than usual <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> tire easily. On his return to Oslo he was laid up for several months, with influenza and later phlebitis, and was visited on his sickbed by King Haakon VII.|$|E

5|$|On 12 January 2009, {{at least}} three people, {{including}} two Mexicans and one American, entered the Parque-Museo La Venta in Villahermosa and damaged just under 30 archaeological pieces, including the four La Venta colossal heads. The vandals were all members of an evangelical church <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> have been carrying out a supposed pre-Columbian ritual, during which salts, grape juice, and oil were thrown on the heads. It was estimated that 300,000 pesos (US$21,900) {{would be needed to}} repair the damage, and the restoration process would last four months. The three vandals were released soon after their arrest after paying 330,000 pesos each.|$|E
5|$|Some higher {{forms of}} land life are now colonising {{the soil of}} Surtsey. The first {{earthworm}} {{was found in a}} soil sample in 1993, probably carried over from Heimaey by a bird. However, the next year earthworms were not found. Slugs were found in 1998, <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be similar to varieties found in the southern Icelandic mainland. Spiders and beetles have also become established.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Iskandar and {{his family}} members were not prosecuted for their past {{violations}} of the law on grounds that the royal immunity was still applicable when the incidences occurred. Nevertheless, shortly after the incident, Sultan Iskandar was prompted {{to take steps to}} rehabilitate his public image, which was more or less tarnished by the incident. In a public speech shortly after the episode, the Sultan was noted to have toned down somewhat on his hardline image <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be somewhat more humble, appealing to Johoreans to maintain their loyalty to him.|$|E

5|$|Another {{featured}} preliminary match involved Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho in a singles match. At Backlash, Michaels defeated Batista (with Jericho as {{the special}} guest referee) in an Interpromotional match. During the match, Michaels countered a Batista Bomb attempt, a powerbomb move {{in which the}} wrestler drops into a sitting position as they slam their opponent down to the mat, <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> have legitimately injured his left knee. On the April 28 episode of Raw, Jericho claimed that Michaels faked his knee injury {{to allow him to}} defeat Batista at Backlash, a claim that Michaels denied. The following week, it was announced that Jericho would face Michaels in a singles match at Judgment Day. On the May 12 episode of Raw, Jericho offered his apologies to Michaels for accusing him of feigning an injury, as well as giving Michaels the opportunity to back out of their match. Michaels revealed that he did indeed fake his knee injury. Four days later, on the May 16 episode of SmackDown, Batista commented that he would hurt Michaels, scripted into the storyline, for faking his injury.|$|E
5|$|In late 2008, US forces began {{accelerating}} their {{move out}} of cities across Iraq, turning over the task of maintaining security to Iraqi forces. The Marines pulled out of both Fallujah and Haditha Dam in November and December. Lance Corporal Brandon Lara from 3rd Battalion 4th Marines was the last American service member killed in Anbar, on 19 July 2009. In early August, a unit of Marines operating in Anbar located and recovered the body of Navy Captain Scott Speicher, who had been missing in action since the 1991 Gulf War. By 6 October 2009, the last two Marine Regiments had left, ending the American combat presence. Experts and many Iraqis were worried that AQI might resurface and attempt mass-casualty attacks to destabilize the country. There was a spike {{in the number of}} suicide attacks, and AQI rebounded in strength through November 2009 <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be launching a concerted effort to cripple the government.|$|E
5|$|In malignant-type {{smallpox}} (also called flat smallpox) the lesions remained almost {{flush with}} the skin {{at the time when}} raised vesicles form in the ordinary type. It is unknown why some people developed this type. Historically, it accounted for 5–10 percent of cases, and the majority (72 percent) were children. Malignant smallpox was accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasted 3–4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of toxemia. The rash on the tongue and palate was extensive. Skin lesions matured slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they were flat <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be buried in the skin. Unlike ordinary-type smallpox, the vesicles contained little fluid, were soft and velvety to the touch, and may have contained hemorrhages. Malignant smallpox was nearly always fatal.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, McCool gained {{selection}} {{as part of}} Australian team to tour England in 1948 under Donald Bradman. Australia had traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the opening match of the tour, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Although he was only selected sporadically during the preceding Test series against India, McCool was chosen alongside off spinner Ian Johnson <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be part of Bradman's Test plans. The home side batted first and McCool took his maiden wicket on English soil, having former England captain Bob Wyatt stumped by fellow Queenslander Don Tallon. He removed Wyatt's replacement for a duck without further addition to the score and ended with 2/38 as the home side were dismissed for 233. McCool returned the favour during Australia's innings. Coming in at No. 5, he made a fifth ball duck and {{was part of a}} middle-order collapse that saw Australia lose 4/38 before steadying to declare at 8/462. In the second innings, McCool did the bulk of the damage, taking four of the five first wicketstwo of whom were stumped by Tallonto leave the hosts at 5/122 before Australia completed an innings victory. McCool had been the most successful bowler in the opening match.|$|E
5|$|Once the Persians {{discovered}} that the Greeks had abandoned their positions <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be in retreat, Mardonius decided to set off in immediate pursuit with the elite Persian infantry. As he did so, {{the rest of the}} Persian army, unbidden, began to move forward. The Spartans and Tegeans had by now reached the Temple of Demeter. The rearguard under Amompharetus began to withdraw from the ridge, under pressure from Persian cavalry, to join them. Pausanias sent a messenger to the Athenians, asking them to join up with the Spartans. However, the Athenians had been engaged by the Theban phalanx and were unable to assist Pausanias. The Spartans and Tegeans were first assaulted by the Persian cavalry, while the Persian infantry made their way forward. They then planted their shields and began shooting arrows at the Greeks, while the cavalry withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Rare took greater liberties with {{violence}} and gore in Battletoads Arcade since {{the product was}} not destined for home consoles. It was Rare's first game to use the 3D graphics technology later popularized in Donkey Kong Country and Killer Instinct. Although the game playtested well <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be financially viable, the publisher hesitated to release it. The game proved unsuccessful in the arcades and its in-production Super NES port was canceled. Retrospective reviews were more positive--Retro Gamer even declared it {{the best of the}} series. Battletoads Arcade received its console debut when it was emulated in the 2015 Rare Replay, a compilation of games from Rare's history for the Xbox One. Rare Replay reviewers were surprised by the quality of the arcade game and some considered it a highlight of the package. Battletoads Arcade remains the last entry in the Battletoads series.|$|E

5|$|The injured Lindwall {{came out}} to bat at 365/7 without a runner to join Hassett, <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to run}} twos and threes without {{significant}} difficulty. Hassett, who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the day, swept Laker for four and then hit him for the first six of the match. The Australian vice-captain added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94. The tourists were unhurried and remained patient as they had bowled England out quickly on the first day and there was still sufficient time to force a result with less than half the playing time elapsed.|$|E
5|$|The {{precipitate}} {{action of}} the Hospitallers could have caused Richard's whole strategy to unravel. However, he recognised that the counterattack, once started, had to be supported by all his army and ordered the signal for a general charge to be sounded. Unsupported, the Hospitallers and the other rear units involved in the initial breakout would have been overwhelmed by the superior numbers of the enemy. The Frankish infantry opened gaps in their ranks for the knights to pass through and the attack naturally developed in echelon from the rear to the van. To the soldiers of Saladin's army, as Baha al-Din noted, the sudden change from passivity to ferocious activity {{on the part of}} the Crusaders was disconcerting, <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be the result of a preconceived plan.|$|E
5|$|The return {{match at}} Anfield took place the {{following}} week. Celtic's Alan Thompson and Liverpool's Dietmar Hamann both {{came close to}} scoring for their respective sides in the opening quarter-hour with long range shots. On 19 minutes, Jerzy Dudek turned a 30-yard free kick from Henrik Larsson around the post. Two minutes from half time, Celtic were awarded a free kick 25 yards from goal. Thompson struck a low shot past Dudek from the set piece, with the ball going under the defensive wall, which had jumped up <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> distract the Liverpool goalkeeper. Celtic sealed their victory on 82 minutes when John Hartson played a one-two with Larsson, and then drove a swerving shot from 25 yards out into the top-right corner of Dudek's goal. Celtic's 20 win saw them win the tie 31 on aggregate and progress to the semi-finals.|$|E

5|$|The story {{followed}} Roy Race, a striker for {{the fictional}} football team Melchester Rovers, based {{in a town}} {{of the same name}} in an unspecified part of England, where Roy lived with his family. In the first episode, a teenaged Roy and his best friend, Blackie Gray, signed for the Rovers after being spotted playing for a youth club team. Eight months later, Roy and Blackie made their first-team debuts against Elbury Wanderers in a game that ended in a 3–3 draw, with Roy scoring twice. He soon became a star, leading the team to either the Football League title or a cup almost every season. In January 1975 he was made player-manager, a position he retained for most of the next 20years. Although the strip followed the Rovers through nearly 40seasons, Roy did not age at the same rate <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be at most in his late thirties by the time the weekly comic ended. This unrealistic longevity was never remarked upon by the weekly comic, although the monthly comic attempted to address the anomaly by explaining that more than one Roy Race had played for Melchester over the years.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball with a first down at its 30-yard line. The Hokie drive fizzled, as had most of the offense in the third quarter, after DeShazo was sacked for a big loss on third down. Indiana returned the Tech punt to its 43-yard line, and Indiana brought in its backup quarterback, Chris Dittoe, to lead the offense. After being sacked on his first play, Dittoe completed a pass to near midfield, making up the yardage that had been lost on the sack. Despite that gain, Indiana couldn't make up the yardage lost to the sack <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be ready to punt the ball. Instead, the Hoosiers faked the punt and threw a pass to an undefended Indiana player who dropped the ball. Following the turnover, Virginia Tech's offense started work at the Indiana 49-yard line. After being stopped short on two rushes, DeShazo completed a 42-yard pass to Antonio Freeman, who raced down the field and into the end zone. The extra point was good, and with 9:37 remaining in the game, Tech took a 3513 lead.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{entered the}} 2005 season having won the 2004ACC Championship, {{the last to}} be awarded without playing a {{championship}} game {{at the end of}} the season. Tech won its first eight games <b>and</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be on course to have an untroubled run to the ACC Championship Game. But against the fifth-ranked Miami Hurricanes, Tech suffered its first defeat of the season, losing 277 on November 5. Because each team had one ACC loss (Miami had previously lost to Florida State) and the Hurricanes had the tie-breaking head-to-head win, Miami had the lead in the Coastal Division. But Miami later lost a second ACC game to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the Hurricanes were knocked out of contention for the Coastal Division title in favor of the Hokies, who lost only to Miami.|$|E
