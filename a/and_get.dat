5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before.

'do I do this <b>and</b> <b>get</b> out of here <b>and</b> <b>get</b> happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E
