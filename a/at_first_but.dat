5|$|Agrippa's {{death in}} 12BC {{elevated}} Tiberius and Drusus {{with respect to}} the succession. At Augustus’ request in 11 BC, Tiberius divorced Vipsania and married Julia the Elder, Augustus' daughter and Agrippa's widow. Tiberius was very reluctant to do this, as Julia had made advances to him when she was married and Tiberius was happily married. His new marriage with Julia was happy <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> turned sour.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the pass, {{the road}} descends through three more long switchbacks {{to the floor}} of the Lake Creek valley. From there it heads south <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>but</b> quickly curving to the east. As it assumes that heading it passes the other set of gates, just west of the very small {{settlement}} of Everett, near where Lake Creek's North Fork joins the main stream.|$|E
5|$|Cattle raising was {{the major}} {{industry}} in the 1840s with sheep becoming predominant in the 1860s. At this time many Victorians settled in the Riverina to breed sheep and cattle to feed the miners {{taking part in the}} Victorian Gold Rush. The herds were considered inferior <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> these pastures were good for stock, and the land which seemed a desert was actually good fattening country.|$|E

5|$|Ground {{operations}} in Normandy were controlled by Montgomery <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> SHAEF Forward headquarters moved to Jullouville in August, and on 1 September Eisenhower assumed control of Bradley's 12th Army Group and Montgomery's 21st Army Group. Smith {{soon realized that}} he had made a mistake. The forward headquarters was remote and inaccessible, and it lacked the necessary communications equipment.|$|E
5|$|In October 1906, Keynes's Civil Service {{career began}} as a clerk in the India Office. He enjoyed his work <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> by 1908 had become bored and {{resigned}} his position to return to Cambridge and work on probability theory, at first privately funded only by two dons at the university – his father and the economist Arthur Pigou.|$|E

5|$|The common {{soldiers}} fought bravely <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> {{they were}} saddled with low pay (with {{which they had}} to purchase their own food and medical care), ammunition shortages, and mixed equipment. Due to the pay system, there were no allotments for their families, who were, therefore, forced to follow their husbands/sons into the battle zones. These problems (exacerbated by continuously declining morale) only increased over time.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{reveals that}} the entire story was a fanfiction created by the Ice King that he is reading to Finn and Jake (who are {{incapacitated}} in ice). The Ice King asks how they enjoyed his story; Finn hesitates <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>but</b> hurriedly placates him when Ice King threatens them with his ice powers.|$|E
5|$|A {{mammalian}} virus, {{the rabbit}} haemorrhagic disease virus {{was introduced to}} Australia to attempt to control the European rabbit populations there. It escaped from quarantine and spread across the country, killing large numbers of rabbits. Very young animals survived, passing immunity to their offspring in due course and eventually producing a virus-resistant population. Introduction into New Zealand in the 1990s was similarly successful <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> a decade later, immunity had developed and populations had returned to pre-RHD levels.|$|E

5|$|After Groundskeeper Willie {{takes away}} Bart's {{skateboard}} for destroying his leaf pile, Bart fills up Willie's shack with creamed corn {{as he is}} sleeping, destroying it. As Willie is taken away for medical attention, he swears revenge on Bart. Meanwhile, Krusty the Clown's show comes under criticism by the Federal Communications Commission for not being educational enough for children. The Channel 6 executive proposes that Krusty cut ten minutes from his three-hour show {{to make room for}} a kids' news program, Kidz News, where children deliver and report news items. Lisa is recruited as a news anchor along with other Springfield Elementary School children. Bart is not chosen <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> is made sportscaster after he complains to Marge.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} a bridge, {{they reached the}} gardens {{in front of the}} palace, and Moberly noticed a lady sketching on the grass who looked at them. She later described what she saw in great detail: the lady was wearing a light summer dress, on her head was a shady white hat, and she had lots of fair hair. Moberly thought she was a tourist <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> the dress appeared to be old-fashioned. Moberly came to believe that the lady was Marie Antoinette. Jourdain, however, did not see the lady.|$|E
5|$|At the Council of Hieria in 754, Constantine V had {{declared}} the adoration of icons to be a heresy, and had thereby elevated iconoclasm to official imperial policy. No persecution of iconophiles was launched <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> iconophile resistance grew, until from 765 on, Constantine began persecuting iconophiles, and especially monks. The {{discovery of a}} wide-ranging iconophile plot against him involving {{some of the highest}} civil and military officials of the state in 766 provoked an extreme reaction. Patriarch Constantine II and other officials were deposed, jailed, publicly humiliated, and finally executed, replaced by new, uncompromisingly iconoclast officials. In addition, the veneration of sacred relics and prayers to the saints and the Virgin Mary were condemned.|$|E

5|$|Augvald {{had set up}} {{his base}} in the {{north-eastern}} part of Karmøy, but {{the western part of}} the island was still ruled by another king, Ferking. The two were not enemies <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> that changed after Augvald and his men attended a midwinter sacrificial banquet in Ferkingstad. What started as a friendly visit turned sour, and Augvald returned home with his men, leaving his daughters held captive at Ferkingstad.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>but</b> eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
5|$|David Kaczynski {{had tried}} to remain {{anonymous}} <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> he was soon identified, {{and within a few}} days an FBI agent team was dispatched to interview David and his wife with their attorney in Washington, D.C. At this and subsequent meetings, David provided letters written by his brother in their original envelopes, allowing the FBI task force to use the postmark dates to add more detail to their timeline of Ted's activities. David developed a respectful relationship with the primary Task Force behavioral analyst, Special Agent Kathleen M. Puckett, whom he met many times in Washington, D.C., Texas, Chicago, and Schenectady, New York, over the nearly two months before the federal search warrant was served on Kaczynski's cabin.|$|E

5|$|Director Hifumi Kono was not {{interested}} in developing a sequel to the original Clock Tower <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> was swayed after seeing the technical possibilities of the next generation consoles. Kono had difficulty in choosing the platform to develop on, but eventually settled for the new PlayStation despite its uncertain future. Clock Tower {{was one of the first}} games developed by Human Entertainment to utilize a 3D graphics engine. The team felt challenged to create high-quality graphics after being impressed by the visuals of Resident Evil (1996), which was announced during development.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1942 Cardus {{rented a}} small flat in the Kings Cross {{district}} of Sydney, where {{he wrote his}} Ten Composers (1945) and Autobiography (1947). He said later that he found the discipline of writing for seven hours a day difficult <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> that the process had turned him from a journalist into something more substantial. When later in 1942 his wife announced her intention of sailing from England to join him, Cardus declined {{to move to a}} larger flat to accommodate them both, and rented a separate establishment for her a mile away. They dined together once a week, but otherwise continued to lead largely separate lives.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{the family}} moved to a {{neighborhood}} on Figueroa Street where they were the only Chinese on their block, living alongside mostly Mexican and Eastern European families. The two hills separating their new home from Chinatown helped Wong to assimilate into American culture. She attended public school with her older sister <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> then moved to a Presbyterian Chinese school when the girls became the target of racial taunts from other students. Classes were taught in English, but Wong attended a Chinese language school afternoons and on Saturdays.|$|E
