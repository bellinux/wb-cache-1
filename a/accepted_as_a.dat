5|$|Although a professional—captains at {{the time}} were almost {{exclusively}} amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held meant that he was <b>accepted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. He disliked the responsibility and decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Knauf {{conceived}} the initial script {{for the show}} between 1990 and 1992 when he was unsatisfied with {{his job as a}} Californian health insurance broker and hoped to become a screenwriter.

Multiple record companies ignored him because he did not portray the 'gangsta image' prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time. After a series of meetings with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal.|$|E
