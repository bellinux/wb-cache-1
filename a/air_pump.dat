5|$|Wright's An Experiment on a Bird in the <b>Air</b> <b>Pump</b> forms part of {{a series}} of candlelit nocturnes that he {{produced}} between 1765 and 1768.|$|E
5|$|Wright's <b>Air</b> <b>Pump</b> {{was unusual}} {{in that it}} {{depicted}} archetypes rather than specific people, though various models for the figures have been suggested. The young lovers may {{have been based on}} Thomas Coltman and Mary Barlow, friends of Wright's, whom he later painted in Mr and Mrs Thomas Coltman (also in the National Gallery) after their marriage in 1769; Erasmus Darwin has been suggested as the man timing the experiment on the left of the table, and John Warltire, whom Darwin had invited to help with some <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> experiments in real life, as the natural philosopher; but Wright never identified any of the subjects or suggested they were based on real people.|$|E
5|$|On {{the table}} are various {{other pieces of}} {{equipment}} that the natural philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, {{and close to the}} man seated to the right is a pair of Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time. What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} natural philosopher, a forerunner {{of the modern}} scientist, recreating one of Robert Boyle's <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> experiments, in which a bird is deprived of air, before a varied group of onlookers. The group exhibits a variety of reactions, {{but for most of}} the audience scientific curiosity overcomes concern for the bird. The central figure looks out of the picture as if inviting the viewer's participation in the outcome.|$|E
5|$|The {{striking}} {{scene has}} been used as the cover illustration for many books on topics both artistic and scientific. It has even spawned pastiches and parodies: the book cover of The Science of Discworld, by Terry Pratchett, Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen, is a tribute to the painting by artist Paul Kidby, who replaces Wright's figures with the book's protagonists. Shelagh Stephenson's play An Experiment with an <b>Air</b> <b>Pump,</b> inspired by the painting, was the joint winner of the 1997 Margaret Ramsay Award and had its premiere at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, in 1998.|$|E
5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the <b>Air</b> <b>Pump</b> is a 1768 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Joseph Wright of Derby, {{one of a}} number of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s. The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was intimately involved in depicting the Industrial Revolution and the scientific advances of the Enlightenment, but while his paintings were recognised as something out of the ordinary by his contemporaries, his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The picture has been owned by the National Gallery, London, since 1863 and is still regarded as a masterpiece of British art. In June 2015 it was on loan to Tate Britain.|$|E
40|$|Resonance {{frequency}} shift of a zinc oxide- (ZnO-) functionalized microcantilever {{as a response}} to carbon monoxide (CO) gas has been investigated. Here, ZnO microrods were grown on the microcantilever surface by a hydrothermal method. The measurement of resonance frequency of the microcantilever vibrations due to the gas was carried out in two conditions, that is, gas flow with and without <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> into an experiment chamber. The results show that the resonance frequency of the ZnO-functionalized microcantilever decreases because of CO in <b>air</b> <b>pumping</b> condition, while it increases when CO is introduced without <b>air</b> <b>pumping.</b> Such change in the resonance frequency is influenced by water vapor condition, and a possible model based on water-CO combination was proposed...|$|R

5|$|By 1889, the Angle Mills {{site was}} the largest steel plate factory in the world. In 1892, in {{addition}} to steelmaking, the company had a foundry (a mile from Consett at Crookhall) capable of making 150 tons of iron castings per week, and a brickworks capable of making around 12,000 bricks per week. The estate had grown to roughly 2,700 workers' cottages. The company ran a 16-bed infirmary to treat injured workers. The 6,000 workers were paid an average of £5.33 a month. The company continually invested in modern equipment, such as a Roots blower (a powerful <b>air</b> <b>pump)</b> that was acquired in 1893.|$|E
5|$|In both {{of these}} works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing {{sculpture}} by candlelight, when the contours showed well and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were {{an essential part of}} the display, used to demonstrate eclipses. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.|$|E
5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the <b>Air</b> <b>Pump</b> {{followed}} in 1768, the emotionally charged experiment contrasting with the orderly scene from The Orrery. The painting, which measures 72 by 94½inches (183 by 244cm), shows a white cockatoo fluttering in panic {{as the air}} is slowly withdrawn from the vessel by the pump. The witnesses display various emotions: {{one of the girls}} worriedly watches the fate of the bird, while the other is too upset to observe and is comforted by her father; two gentlemen (one of them dispassionately timing the experiment) and a boy look on with interest, while the young lovers {{to the left of the}} painting are absorbed only in each other. The scientist himself looks directly out of the picture, as if challenging the viewer to judge whether the pumping should continue, killing the bird, or whether the air should be replaced and the cockatoo saved.|$|E

40|$|Investigations of {{hydraulic}} {{operating conditions}} of <b>air</b> lift <b>pump</b> with {{three types of}} air-water mixers. The paper presents the analysis of results of the investigations concerning the influence of various constructive solutions of the air-water mixers on hydraulic operating conditions of the <b>air</b> lift <b>pump.</b> The scope of the investigations encompassed the determination of characteristics of delivery head and delivery rate for three types of air-water mixers applied in the constructed <b>air</b> lift <b>pump.</b> Using the obtained results, {{the efficiency of the}} three types of air-water mixers applied in this <b>air</b> lift <b>pump</b> was determined. The analysis was carried out and there was checked whether the improved analytical Stenning-Martin model can be used to design <b>air</b> lift <b>pumps</b> with the air-water mixers of these types. The highest capacity in the water transport was reached by the <b>air</b> lift <b>pump</b> with the 1 st type air-water mixer, the lowest one – with the 3 rd type air-water mixer. The water flow in the <b>air</b> lift <b>pump</b> increases along with the rise in the air flow. The lower are the hydraulic losses generated during flow of the air flux by the air-water mixer, the higher is the <b>air</b> lift <b>pump</b> capacity. Along with the rise in the water delivery head, the capacity of the <b>air</b> lift <b>pump</b> decreases. The highest efficiency is reached by the <b>air</b> lift <b>pump</b> with the 1 st type air-water mixer, the lowest – with the 3 st type air-water mixer. The efficiency of the <b>air</b> lift <b>pump</b> for the three investigated types of air-water mixers decreases along with the rise in air flow rate and water delivery head. The values of submergence ratio (h/L) of the delivery pipe, calculated {{with the use of the}} improved analytical Stenning-Martin model, coincide quite well with the values of h/L determined from the measurements...|$|R
5|$|In The Orrery, all the {{subjects}} {{have been identified}} apart from the philosopher, who has physical similarities to Isaac Newton but differs enough to make positive identification impossible. Nicolson detects the strong influence of Frye throughout the picture. Particularly striking is the similarity between Frye's mezzotint Portrait of a Young Man of 1760–1761 and {{the figure of the}} boy with his head cocked staring intently at the bird. In 1977, Michael Wynne published one of Frye's chalk drawings from around 1760, An old man leaning on a staff, which is so similar to the observer in the right foreground in Wright's picture to make it impossible that Wright had not seen it. There are other hints of Frye's style in the painting: even the figure of the natural philosopher has touches of Frye's Figure with Candle. Though Henry Fuseli would later also develop on the style of Frye's work {{there is no evidence of}} him having painted anything similar until the early 1780s. So, although he had already been in England at the time the <b>Air</b> <b>Pump</b> was produced, it is unlikely that he was an influence on Wright.|$|E
5|$|The French {{astronomer}} Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille {{first described}} the constellation in French as la Machine Pneumatique (the Pneumatic Machine) in 1751–52, commemorating the <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> invented by the French physicist Denis Papin. De Lacaille had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year {{stay at the}} Cape of Good Hope, devising fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. He named all but one in honour of instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Lacaille depicted Antlia as a single-cylinder vacuum pump used in Papin's initial experiments, while German astronomer Johann Bode chose the more advanced double-cylinder version. Lacaille Latinised the name to Antlia pneumatica on his 1763 chart. English astronomer John Herschel proposed shrinking the name to one word in 1844, noting that Lacaille himself had abbreviated his constellations thus on occasion. This was universally adopted. The International Astronomical Union adopted {{it as one of}} the 88 modern constellations in 1922.|$|E
25|$|Around 1908, {{the first}} {{mechanical}} aquarium <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> was invented, powered by running water, instead of electricity. The {{introduction of the}} <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> into the hobby is considered by several historians of the hobby to be a pivotal moment in its development.|$|E

50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>pumps,</b> such as {{the roots}} blower, use meshing {{impellers}} to move air through a system. Applications include blast furnaces, ventilation systems, and superchargers for internal combustion engines.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first of}} these devices to be widely used however was {{developed}} by Drinker and Shaw in 1928. The iron lung, often {{referred to in the}} early days as the [...] "Drinker respirator", was invented by Philip Drinker (1894–1972) and Louis Agassiz Shaw, Jr., professors of industrial hygiene at the Harvard School of Public Health. The machine was powered by an electric motor with <b>air</b> <b>pumps</b> from two vacuum cleaners. The <b>air</b> <b>pumps</b> changed the pressure inside a rectangular, airtight metal box, pulling air {{in and out of the}} lungs.|$|R
25|$|Temperature {{must also}} be {{accounted}} for because the <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> will heat the air passing through it making the air down stream of it less dense and more viscous. This difference must be corrected for. Temperature is measured at the test piece plenum and at the metering element plenum. Correction factors are then applied during flow calculations. Some flow bench designs place the <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> after the metering element so that heating by the <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> is not as large a concern.|$|E
25|$|In 1689, Denis Papin had {{suggested}} that the pressure and fresh air inside a diving bell could be maintained by a force pump or bellows. His idea was implemented exactly 100 years later by the engineer John Smeaton who built the first workable diving <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> in 1789.|$|E
25|$|Sketches of {{information}} on the older organ are available mostly through personal accounts. An elderly parishioner recounted helping out on Sundays as a young boy by operating the manual <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> of the organ. By the 1960s, the Gallery Organ became so dilapidated that it remained silent for nearly two decades.|$|E
50|$|Shaw was an {{instructor}} in physiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, {{where he is}} credited in 1928 along with Philip Drinker (1894-1972, associate professor of industrial hygiene) and his brother Cecil K. Drinker (1887-1956, later dean of the Harvard School of Public Health) for inventing the first widely used iron lung. The machine was powered by an electric motor with <b>air</b> <b>pumps</b> from two vacuum cleaners. The <b>air</b> <b>pumps</b> changed the pressure inside a rectangular, airtight metal box, pulling air {{in and out of}} the lungs.|$|R

25|$|A single <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> for the {{locomotive}} and train air brakes was fitted to the fireman's (left) side, with air tanks under the running boards on both sides. Like all larger North American coal-burning locomotives of the time, an automatic stoker was fitted; the two-cylinder engine to drive this {{was under the}} cab floor on the fireman's side.|$|E
25|$|Development resumed, {{to improve}} {{emissions}} durability and ready the engine for more stringent 1975 standards. The fuel injection was redesigned for better air distribution. High-energy electronic ignition and mandatory catalytic converter were added; also a Pulse Air system, functionally {{the same as}} an <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> but without the pump's six-horsepower loss. A larger catalytic converter further guarded against power loss. More advanced ignition timing, and the lead-free fuel required with the converter, prevented exhaust-valve failure.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to the air brake is the vacuum brake, in which a steam-operated ejector is mounted on the engine instead of the <b>air</b> <b>pump,</b> to create a vacuum and release the brakes. A secondary ejector or crosshead vacuum pump is used to maintain the vacuum in the system against the small leaks in the pipe connections between carriages and wagons. Vacuum systems existed on British, Indian, West Australian and South African railway networks.|$|E
5000|$|Like all gouramis, the croaking gourami {{can breathe}} {{atmospheric}} oxygen from {{above the water}} surface using a specialized labyrinth organ (like the Betta) if necessary. It is important, therefore, that {{the surface of the}} water be exposed to fresh air, usually accomplished by keeping them in an open-top tank or using a hood that allows air ventilation. If you are using good <b>air</b> <b>pumps,</b> this is not always needed, since the <b>air</b> <b>pumps</b> will refresh the air above the water. Very cold air temperatures at the water surface may lead to infections of the labyrinth organ.|$|R
