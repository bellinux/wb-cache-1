5|$|Although {{twice as}} {{powerful}} as the Alpine, the Tiger is only <b>about</b> <b>twenty</b> per cent heavier, but the extra weight of the larger engine required some minor suspension modifications. Nevertheless, the Tiger's front-to-back weight ratio is substantially similar to the Alpine's, at 51.7/48.3 front/rear.|$|E

5|$|Boletus edulis is {{well suited}} to drying—its flavour intensifies, it is easily reconstituted, and its {{resulting}} texture is pleasant. Reconstitution is done by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for <b>about</b> <b>twenty</b> minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too {{can be used in}} subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. Some of this content is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.|$|E
5|$|Brady was {{admitted}} to the New York Bar in either 1835 or 1836, when he was <b>about</b> <b>twenty</b> years old.

Though Brady lost that case, his proficiency for law and oration was immediately noted.|$|E

Simon-René maintained a successful enterprise as a leatherer and maker of horse tack.|$|E

5|$|Yellow-tailed black {{cockatoos}} {{have been}} reported flocking to Banksia cones ten days after bushfire as the follicles open. With pine trees, they prefer green cones, nipping them off at the stem and holding in one foot, then systematically lifting each segment and extracting the seed.

5|$|<b>About</b> <b>twenty</b> {{isotopes}} and six {{nuclear isomers}} (excited states of an isotope) of berkelium have been characterized with the mass numbers ranging from 235 to 254. All {{of them are}} radioactive. The longest half-lives are observed for 247Bk (1,380years), 248Bk (over300years) and 249Bk (330days); the half-lives of the other isotopes range from microseconds to several days. The isotope which is the easiest to synthesize is berkelium-249. This emits mostly soft β-particles which are inconvenient for detection. Its alpha radiation is rather weak – 1.45% {{with respect to the}} β-radiation – but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. The second important berkelium isotope, berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter, as are most actinide isotopes.|$|E

The role of Bhagyalakshmi was initially offered to Sripriya, who could not accept the role due to her prior commitments, before Sridevi was chosen for it. Poornam Vishwanathan was cast as the school headmaster, while Silk Smitha, who had done around 20 films by then and was considered only for performing item numbers, was cast as the headmaster's sexually excited wife.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Rodney was escorting a {{fleet of}} supply ships to relieve the Spanish siege of Gibraltar with {{a fleet of}} <b>about</b> <b>twenty</b> ships of the line when he {{encountered}} Lángara's squadron south of Cape St. Vincent.

In a running battle that lasted from mid-afternoon until after midnight, the British captured four Spanish ships, including Lángara's flagship. Two other ships were also captured, but their final disposition is unclear; some Spanish sources indicate they were retaken by their Spanish crews, while Rodney's report indicates the ships were grounded and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|After the American Civil War, Stanton's {{commitment}} to female suffrage caused a schism in the women's rights movement when she, together with Susan B. Anthony, declined to support {{passage of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. She opposed giving added legal protection and voting rights to African American men while women, black and white, were denied those same rights. Her position on this issue, together with her thoughts on organized Christianity and women's issues beyond voting rights, {{led to the formation}} of two separate women's rights organizations that were finally rejoined, with Stanton as president of the joint organization, <b>about</b> <b>twenty</b> years after her break from the original women's suffrage movement.|$|E

The company built and garrisoned the blockhouse for a few weeks, but when a false alarm was sounded regarding Indians attacking the settlements, the men returned to their homes. This was the only fort ever constructed in Union County, and some of the foundation is still visible today.|$|E
