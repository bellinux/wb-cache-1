FOV experiments have been carried out on polymeric specimens in clean (light) and salt (heavy) fog. A new characterization method based on the electro-geometrical parameters (FOV versus leakage distance) for each polymer is used. It appears that the resistance to tracking resulting from FOV arcs may be assessed via the slope of FOV curves versus the leakage distance and can be used as an indicator of surface degradation in clean or salt fog. The higher the slope value, the stronger the polymeric surface is against tracking and erosion...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} aimed at the {{assessment}} of the resistance to tracking of insulators made of several polymers, widely used in electrical industry (medium voltage cable accessories such as terminations and insulators and <b>anchoring</b> <b>clamps</b> and mechanical screw fuses), under polluted environments. This new method performed on one insulator model is based on the electro-geometrical characteristics (AC flashover voltage versus leakage distance). The tested materials cover thermoplastics, (namely polyamide 6 (PA 6 / 50), fireproofed polyamide 66 (PA 66 / 50), polycarbonate (PC/ 40) and polyarylamide (PARA/ 50)) thermosetting (namely two cycloaliphatic epoxy resins (EP 1 and EP 2)) and elastomers (namely two EPDM materials noted EPDM and EPDM V 0 (fireproofed)). Polluted environments such as clean (light) and salt (heavy) fogs have been created to assess the resistance of polymers to partial discharges (erosion and tracking). Results regarding the flashover voltage (FOV) show a significant reduction in the presence of clean fog equal to 50 % of the value measured in dry conditions for all polymers. This decrease is more pronounced in salt fog (- 80 % reduction of FOV). Surface degradations suggest that epoxy resins and EPDM elastomers are subjected to fewer damages in salt fog when being compared to thermoplastics. It is established that epoxy resins behave better than EPDM elastomers against discharges. In addition, polycarbonate (PC/ 40) exhibits the worst properties because of large tracking paths that form on its surface...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{mechanism}} of the anchorage effect of the anchorage cable is very complicated. There are many factors which affect the anchoring effect. The loss of anchorage force concerns with the qualities of rock and soil masses, materials, <b>anchor</b> <b>clamping,</b> the construction technology and operation and management level and so on. Taking the Pre-stressed anchorage projects as examples, with the method of geological survey, experimental study, numerical simulation, theoretical analysis, the paper makes study on the loss of anchorage force caused by the qualities of hard rock, weak rock, and broken rock and soil masses.

50|$|Monogenea {{are small}} {{parasitic}} flatworms mainly found on skin or gills of fish.They are rarely longer than about 2 cm. A few species infecting certain marine fish are larger and marine forms are generally {{larger than those}} found on fresh water hosts.Monogeneans lack respiratory, skeletal and circulatory systems and have no or weakly developed oral suckers.Monogenea attach to hosts using hooks, clamps {{and a variety of}} other specialized structures. They are often capable of dramatically elongating and shortening as they move. Biologists need to ensure that specimens are completely relaxed before measurements are taken.Like all ectoparasites, monogeneans have well-developed attachment structures. The anterior structures are collectively termed the prohaptor, while the posterior ones are collectively termed the opisthaptor, or simply haptor. The posterior opisthaptor with its hooks, <b>anchors,</b> <b>clamps</b> etc. is typically the major attachment organ.Like other flatworms, Monogenea have no true body cavity (coelom). They have a simple digestive system consisting of a mouth opening with a muscular pharynx and an intestine with no terminal opening (anus). Generally, they also are hermaphroditic with functional reproductive organs of both sexes occurring in one individual. Most species are oviparous but a few are viviparous. Monogenea are Platyhelminthes and therefore are among the lowest invertebrates to possess three embryonic germ layers—endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. In addition, they have a head region that contains concentrated sense organs and nervous tissue (brain).|$|R

40|$|Single-molecule {{techniques}} are developed to examine mechanistic features of individual E. coli replisomes during synthesis of long DNA molecules. We find that single replisomes exhibit constant rates of fork movement, but {{the rates of}} different replisomes vary over a surprisingly wide range. Interestingly, lagging strand synthesis decreases {{the rate of the}} leading strand, suggesting that lagging strand operations exert a drag on replication fork progression. The opposite is true for processivity. The lagging strand significantly increases the processivity of the replisome, possibly reflecting the increased grip to DNA provided by 2 DNA polymerases <b>anchored</b> to sliding <b>clamps</b> on both the leading and lagging strands...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the susceptibility of the MEMS (MicroElectroMechanical Systems) devices to shock, tests were performed using haversine shock pulses with widths of 1 to 0. 2 ms in the range from 500 g to 40, 000 g. The authors chose a surface-micromachined microengine because it has all the components needed for evaluation: springs that flex, gears that are <b>anchored,</b> and <b>clamps</b> and spring stops to maintain alignment. The microengines, which were unpowered for the tests, performed quite well at most shock levels with a majority functioning after the impact. Debris from the die edges moved at levels greater than 4, 000 g causing shorts in the actuators and posing reliability concerns. The coupling agent used to prevent stiction in the MEMS release weakened the die-attach bond, which produced failures at 10, 000 g and above. At 20, 000 g the authors began to observe structural damage in some of the thin flexures and 2. 5 -micron diameter pin joints. The authors observed electrical failures caused by the movement of debris. Additionally, they observed a new failure mode where stationary comb fingers contact the ground plane resulting in electrical shorts. These new failure were observed in the control group indicating that they were not shock related...|$|R

This paper reports on the theory and experimental verification underpinning optimization of the active electrode area {{in order to maximize}} output power. The calculations show that, in order to maximize the output power of a PVEH, the electrode should cover the piezoelectric layer from the peak strain area to a position, where the strain is a half of the average strain in all the previously covered area. With the proposed electrode design, the output power can be improved by 145 % and 126 % for a cantilever and a clamped-clamped beam, respectively. MEMS piezoelectric harvesters are fabricated to experimentally validate the theory. EPSRC (Grant EP/L 010917 / 1...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{includes an}} attachment apparatus comprising a rotation limiting member adapted to be threaded onto a threaded member; and a preload nut adapted to be threaded onto the threaded member. The rotation limiting member comprises {{a plurality of}} pins; and the preload nut comprises plurality of slots, preferably wherein the plurality of pins and the plurality of slots are the same in number, which is preferably three. The plurality of pins of the rotation limiting member are filled into a corresponding plurality of slots of the preload nut to form a rotatable unit adapted to be threaded onto the threaded member. In use, the rotatable unit is threaded onto the threaded member. The present invention thus provides a unitized removable device for holes, including holes other than circular in shape, which have an established depth before an end of, or before an enlargement of the hole. The configuration of some exposed part of the device, or the head, is shaped and formed for its intended purpose, such as <b>clamping,</b> <b>anchor</b> points, eye bolts, stud anchor, and the like. The device allows for the installation, preloading and removal of all components of the device, as a unit, without damage to the member for which attachment is required by simple rotations of some exposed part of the device...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{quantify}} {{the strength of}} suture fixation of knotless suture anchors {{in relation to the}} anchors' pullout strength and to compare these results with the static friction between different sutures and anchor materials. METHODS: Suture slippage within the anchor and pullout strength of 4 different knotless suture anchor models were assessed in a bovine bone model. Furthermore, the peak force before onset of slippage of different sutures trapped between increasingly loaded 4 -mm rods made of commonly used anchor material (polyetheretherketone, poly-L-lactide acid, metal) was assessed. RESULTS: In all but 1 of the tested anchors, there was a relevantly lower load needed for slippage of the sutures than to pull out the anchor from bone. The mean load to anchor pullout ranged between 156 and 269 N. The load to suture slippage ranged between 66 and 109 N. All sutures were better held between the metal rods (mean, 21; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 19. 2 to 23. 3) than with polyetheretherketone rods (mean, 17; 95 % CI, 15. 7 to 18. 1) or poly-L-lactide acid rods (mean, 18; 95 % CI, 17. 6 to 18. 4). CONCLUSIONS: In the case of suture anchors that hold the sutures by clamping, the hold of the suture in the anchor may be far lower than the pullout strength of the anchor from bone, because the sutures just slip out from the <b>anchor</b> through the <b>clamping</b> mechanism. This is well explained by the low static friction achieved between the tested sutures and the test rods made of anchor materials. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The use of knotless suture anchors appears quick and easy to perform; however, most of the anchor systems could not even reach half of the anchor pullout strength from bone before suture slippage occurred...|$|R

Cisterna je značajan inženjerski zahvat u 15. stoljeću kojeg gradi Jakov Correr iz Tranija. Bunarske krune na terasi cisterne izradili su Juraj Mihajlov iz Zadra i Marko Petrov iz Apulije. Analiza povijesnih izvora i zatečenog stanja pokazuje da je objekt uz minimalne preinake do danas sačuvan u izvornom oblikuIn the Middle Ages, Šibenik was chronically {{short of}} water. In the city {{there was a}} paucity of {{structures}} for water supply, the construction of which was thus promoted by the reformed city statute of the 14 th century. At that time {{there was just a}} single public water supply feature, a cistern that was built in the area between the town hall and St James Cathedral. Water was brought in from Vodice, but when this became dangerous, the city decided to build, with the help of Venice, a large new cistern. From 1446 a cistern was built that was called “the four-wells cistern”. It was a considerable civil engineering exploit for the 15 th century, one undertaken by Jakov Correr of Tranio. The well heads on the terrace of the cistern were made by Juraj Mihajlov of Zadar and Marko Petrov from Apulia. A number of 15 th century sources concerning the construction of the large new cistern are extant, and an analysis of them and the state as found shows that the structure has come down to us in its original form with the slightest of modifications. In parallel with the recent renovation of the cistern, investigation operations on the plateau were carried out. They were done from March to June, 2004. When {{a good deal of the}} plateau was uncovered, an original paving with red brick in a fish-bone bond was determined, as well as the composition of the layers of the plateau. The arches were made of brick, but in one part of tufa. By gradual probing, the original manner of water filtration was determined. The rainwater was concentrated in the central collection channel, where there were six water filters. More detailed research showed the composition of the characteristic filter, composed of a pool filled with pebbles, and a central circular pool for fine filtration. The well heads were done in circular form on a stone base leaning in towards the well head, the result being that any water spilled would be directed back into the cistern, which was an original manner of saving water around the well head. The well heads were not fixed to the base, only the parts of the well head to each other. The <b>anchors</b> or <b>clamps</b> that kept these parts together were of iron, cut at the ends “cold” for the sake of a better bond with the molten lead. On the plateau seven valuable items of spolia were discovered, on the whole architectural details of unknown structures. The research works were very complex and provided fresh knowledge about the way in which this kind of communal medieval structure in Dalmatia was constructed...|$|R
