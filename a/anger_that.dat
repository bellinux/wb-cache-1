5|$|During the Pittston strike, the UMWA {{wanted to}} only use nonviolent means of {{protest against the}} company. Many union members practiced this method of civil disobedience and found {{creative}} ways for their message to be heard such as mass sit down strike and road blockades. However, many wildcat strikers ignored {{the request of the}} UMWA and used violence to express the <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> they felt toward the Pittston Coal Company. By the time the strike had ended, over 4,000people had been arrested for their actions.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, the Stuckists held an {{exhibition}} at A Gallery, I Won't Have Sex with You {{as long as}} We're Married, titled after words apparently said to Thomson by his ex-wife, Stella Vine on their wedding night. The show coincided {{with the opening of}} Vine's major show at Modern Art Oxford and was prompted by Thomson's <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> the material promoting her show did not mention her time with the Stuckists. Tate chairman Paul Myners visited both shows.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners {{believe they}} have won the study, but the guards have tricked them into winning, {{allowing}} them to escape. Keith tells the police the story of Kendall and Cormac's deaths: Kendall gave Keith a valuable painting disguised as money in a case, and Cormac tried to kill Kendall and Keith to get the case's contents. Cormac killed Liam out of <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> there was no money. The episode concludes with Logan streaking through sociology class, fulfilling a bet made earlier in the episode.|$|E

50|$|Robert De Niro was <b>angered</b> <b>that</b> Cannon Films {{took his}} {{previously}} shot footage and inserted {{it into an}} entirely new film and legal action was almost taken.|$|R
5|$|Ann {{comes to}} Leslie's house, and finds it full of stacks of boxes, papers and garbage. When they find {{themselves}} unable to clean it, Leslie calls Maria Portlesman (Bonita Friedericy), who teaches cleaning courses at the recreation center. She declines payment and hints she would prefer preferential treatment when Leslie cuts the classes, despite Leslie's assurance this will not happen. When Leslie realizes she has not prepared any food for the party, she calls a culinary teacher from the recreation center. Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to April (Aubrey Plaza), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting chewed up gum in Justin's pockets. Eventually, Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> Leslie invited her, especially because Ron is romantically interested in her. When Ron impresses Wendy by eating a hot red pepper, Tom attempts to eat a bigger one, but has {{to run to the}} bathroom in pain immediately. When Justin starts yawning, a worried Leslie calls in other recreation center teachers to make the party more interesting, including a belly-dancer, a fencer, a cartoonist and an origami teacher.|$|E
5|$|In March 1896, the Matabele again rose {{up against}} the British South Africa Company {{administration}} in what became called the Second Matabele War or the First Chimurenga (liberation war). Mlimo, the Matabele spiritual leader, is credited with fomenting much of the <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> led to this confrontation. The colonists' defenses in Matabeleland were undermanned due to the ill-fated Jameson Raid into the South African Republic (or Transvaal), {{and in the first}} few months of the war alone hundreds of white settlers were killed. With few troops to support them, the settlers quickly built a laager in the centre of Bulawayo on their own and mounted patrols under such figures as Burnham, Robert Baden-Powell, and Frederick Selous. The Matabele retreated into their stronghold of the Matopos Hills near Bulawayo, a region that became the scene of the fiercest fighting between Matabele warriors and settler patrols. It was also during this war that two scouts of very different backgrounds, Burnham and Baden-Powell, would first meet and discuss ideas for training youth that would eventually become the plan for the program and the code of honor for the Boy Scouts.|$|E
25|$|Sweeney was {{eventually}} {{found not guilty}} by reason of insanity and committed to full-time psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia. By 1992, Sweeney was on 16-hour-a-day furloughs. Members of the Lowenstein family, who had opposed prosecutorial plans to seek a sentence of death for Sweeney, expressed grave concern about the supervision Sweeney would receive and <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> a murderer was being given such privileges.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a speech}} <b>that</b> <b>angered</b> him, <b>that</b> cast out entirely the softer mood {{that had been}} growing in him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} <b>angered</b> <b>that</b> you had spent money foolishly," [...] {{the girl said}} after a pause, [...] "when you knew I shouldn't take it, but I couldn't be angered any other way." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{perpetrator}} was Jordanian Army Corporal Ahmed Daqamseh, who {{stated that}} he attacked because he was insulted and <b>angered</b> <b>that</b> the girls were whistling and clapping while he was praying. He was born in 1968.|$|R
25|$|Despite Shea's legal successes, he {{lost control}} of the Teamsters union. Shea {{initially}} attempted to assert his power by replacing and blacklisting his opponents within the union as he had done before. But at a closed-door meeting of the union's executive board, the board expressed its <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> Shea had not resigned as promised after the conclusion of his two trials. Subsequently, nearly all of Shea's backers withdrew their support for his presidency.|$|E
25|$|Also in 675, Li Hong the Crown Prince died suddenly—with {{traditional}} historians largely attributing {{his death}} to poisoning by Empress Wu, {{due to her}} <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> he tried to curb her power grab and had shown sympathy to his two older sisters born of Consort Xiao—Princesses Yiyang and Gao'an. Emperor Gaozong, in grief, posthumously honored Li Hong as an emperor, and he created Empress Wu's second son, Li Xian the Prince of Yong, crown prince.|$|E
25|$|Journalist Ida B. Wells of Memphis {{investigated}} the lynchings, {{as one of}} the men killed was a friend of hers. She demonstrated that these and other lynchings were more often due to economic and social competition than any criminal offenses by black men. Her findings were considered so controversial and aroused so much <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> she was forced {{to move away from the}} city. But she continued to investigate and publish the abuses of lynching.|$|E
5000|$|The {{contract}} {{by which}} the land was granted to the company was challenged in the Egyptian court. The Egyptians were <b>angered</b> <b>that</b> the land had been sold below value to Talaat Mostafa Group during Mubarak's rule.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Angered</b> <b>that</b> his {{assistance}} to American forces {{had not been}} rewarded, and his removal from Paktia, Zadran's forces quickly became a [...] "renegade" [...] force. In September 2002, they laid an unsuccessful siege {{to the city of}} Khost.|$|R
5000|$|He also {{attended}} the British Intelligence Academy with Austin (along with Basil Exposition and Number 2), and is <b>angered</b> <b>that</b> Austin won the [...] "International Man of Mystery" [...] award, while he, the academy's best student, was overlooked.|$|R
25|$|Advocates of this {{treatment}} {{also believe that}} emotional attachment of a child to a caregiver begins during the prenatal period, during which the unborn child {{is aware of the}} mother's thoughts and emotions. If the mother is distressed by the pregnancy, especially if she considers abortion, the child responds with distress and <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> continue through postnatal life. If the child is separated from the mother after birth, no matter how early this occurs, the child again feels distress and rage that will block attachment to a foster or adoptive caregiver.|$|E
25|$|Mlimo, the Ndebele spiritual/religious leader, is {{credited}} with fomenting much of the <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> led to this confrontation. He convinced the Ndebele and Shona that the white settlers (almost 4,000 strong by then) {{were responsible for the}} drought, locust plagues and the cattle disease rinderpest ravaging the country at the time. Mlimo's call to battle was well timed. Only a few months earlier, the British South Africa Company's Administrator General for Matabeleland, Leander Starr Jameson, had sent most of his troops and armaments to fight the Transvaal Republic in the Jameson Raid. This left the country’s defences in disarray. The Ndebele began their revolt in March 1896, and in June 1896 they were joined by the Shona.|$|E
25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
50|$|Annie Duke was <b>angered</b> <b>that</b> Claudia {{left for}} the night because she had such {{a pivotal role in}} the task. Annie also wanted to write the script of the comic instead of Joan Rivers (an {{accomplished}} writer), which infuriated Joan.|$|R

25|$|I/O {{psychologists are}} {{involved}} in the research and the practice of occupational stress and design of individual and organizational interventions to manage and reduce the stress levels and increase productivity, performance, health and wellbeing. Occupational stress can have implications for organizational performance because of the emotions job stress evokes. For example, a job stressor such as conflict with a supervisor can precipitate <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> in turn motivates counterproductive workplace behaviors. I/O research has examined the association between work stressors and aggression, theft, substance abuse, and depressive symptoms. A number of models have been developed to explain the job stress process, including the person-environment fit model and the demand-control model. Those models became a cornerstone of the emergence, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, of a new discipline relevant to research on occupational stress; the discipline, occupational health psychology, is an offshoot of i/o psychology, health psychology, and occupational medicine.|$|E
25|$|The pair meet Wichita (Emma Stone) and {{her younger}} sister Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) in a grocery store. The sisters are con artists, and trick Tallahassee and Columbus into handing over their weapons by pretending that Little Rock was {{infected}} by the disease, then steal their Escalade. The two men find a yellow Hummer H2 loaded with weapons and go after the sisters. However, the girls spring another trap for them and take them hostage. Tallahassee steals his gun back and has a stand-off with Wichita, until Columbus lashes out in <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> they have bigger problems to worry about, resulting in an uneasy truce between them. The sisters reveal {{that they are going}} to the Pacific Playland amusement park in Los Angeles, an area supposedly free of zombies. After learning his hometown has been destroyed, and his parents likely killed, Columbus decides to accompany the others to California. Along the trip, Columbus persists in trying to impress and woo Wichita.|$|E
25|$|Bonifacio {{was also}} subject to rumors {{that he had}} stolen Katipunan funds, his sister was the {{mistress}} of a priest, {{and he was an}} agent provocateur paid by friars to foment unrest. Also circulated were anonymous letters which told the people of Cavite not to idolize Bonifacio because he was a Mason, a mere Manila employee, allegedly an atheist, and uneducated. According to these letters, Bonifacio did not deserve the title of Supremo since only God was supreme. This last allegation was made despite the fact that Supremo was meant to be used in conjunction with Presidente, i.e. Presidente Supremo (Supreme President) to distinguish the president of the Katipunan Supreme Council from council presidents of subordinate Katipunan chapters like the Magdalo and Magdiwang. Bonifacio suspected the rumor-mongering to be the work of the Magdalo leader Daniel Tirona. He confronted Tirona, whose airy reply provoked Bonifacio to such <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> he drew a gun and would have shot Tirona if others had not intervened.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{chose to}} travel alone, my dear sister, for reasons best known to yourself," [...] {{retorted}} the Comte, greatly <b>angered</b> <b>that</b> M. le préfet should hear {{the fact that}} Mme. la Duchesse douairière had travelled at any time without an escort.|$|R
2500|$|Both {{sides were}} deeply {{unhappy with the}} events of July 1995. Residents were <b>angered</b> <b>that</b> the parade had gone ahead and at {{what they saw as}} unionist triumphalism, while Orangemen and their {{supporters}} were <b>angered</b> <b>that</b> their parade had been held up by an illegal protest. Some Orangemen formed a group called Spirit of Drumcree (SoD) to defend their [...] "right to march". At a SoD meeting in Belfast's Ulster Hall one of the platform speakers said, to applause:Sectarian means you belong to a particular sect or organisation. I belong to the Orange Institution. Bigot means you look after the people you belong to. That's what I'm doing. I'm a sectarian bigot and proud of it.|$|R
50|$|Maverick cop Jake Wilder (Chuck Norris), {{is called}} by police captain Ken Callahan (Clyde Kusatsu), who {{requests}} Jake {{to take over}} the case. Jake is <b>angered</b> <b>that</b> he has to work with Reno, despite Reno proving himself capable through a battle training scenario.|$|R
25|$|After {{considerable}} {{difficulties with}} the Chinese, he sailed again with his one remaining vessel to cruise {{in search of}} one of the richly laden Manila galleons that conducted the trade between Mexico and the Chinese merchants in the Philippines. The indomitable perseverance he had shown during one of the most arduous voyages in the history of sea adventure gained the reward of the capture of an immensely rich prize, Nuestra Señora de Covadonga, possessing 1,313,843 pieces of eight, which he encountered off Cape Espiritu Santo on 20 June 1743. The charts captured with the ship added many islands (and phantom islands) to the British knowledge of the Pacific, including the Anson Archipelago. Anson took his prize back to Macao, sold her cargo to the Chinese, kept the specie, and sailed for England. Passing a French fleet then patrolling the Channel by means of a thick fog, he reached via the Cape of Good Hope on 15 June 1744. The prize money earned from the capture of the galleon made Anson a rich man for life and bought him considerable political influence. He initially refused promotion to rear-admiral of the blue, however, out of <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> the admiralty refused to sanction a captain's commission he had given one of his officers.|$|E
25|$|Molly Weasley (née Prewett) {{is married}} to Arthur Weasley and mother of seven children, {{including}} Ron Weasley, who becomes Harry Potter's best friend. Molly is born into the pure-blood Prewett family, being the sister of Gideon and Fabian Prewett. The character is first introduced in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, when she kindly tells Harry how to cross the barrier through to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, she is furious with Fred, George, and Ron after she discovers that they flew their parents' enchanted car to rescue Harry from his aunt and uncle who had imprisoned him in his room. At {{the beginning of the}} school year, Molly sends Ron a Howler, screaming at him in <b>anger</b> <b>that</b> he and Harry flew the family car again, this time to Hogwarts. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the Weasleys win the Daily Prophet draw and use the gold on a trip to Egypt to visit Bill. They return to Britain and stay at the Leaky Cauldron with Harry and Hermione. Harry overhears Mr and Mrs Weasley arguing one night about telling Harry the truth about the supposed connection between Sirius Black and Harry; Arthur feels Harry should know the truth but Molly, feeling the truth would terrify him, assures him Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts with Dumbledore's protection, and orders Percy Weasley to keep an eye on Harry at the school.|$|E
