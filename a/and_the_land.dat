5|$|The {{relationships}} of {{ownership of the}} industry, the banking sector and rural property after the nationalization <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> reform were fundamentally altered.

5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the sea, Jaywick had never been a practical place for farming due to the risk from floods; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> remained unused. A sea wall was built in 1880 to protect against flooding. Ordnance Survey mapping around 1897 shows Jaywick as a few farmhouses near what is now Crossways on the Tudor estate.|$|E
5|$|By October 1866, {{orders were}} given to the Ordnance Sergeant at Fort Corcoran to compile a {{complete}} list of all the weapons at the fort in order to assist in their final movement to the Washington Arsenal or other permanent forts. Shortly afterward, the fort was dismantled <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> returned to its original owner.|$|E
5|$|Cattle raising was {{the major}} {{industry}} in the 1840s with sheep becoming predominant in the 1860s. At this time many Victorians settled in the Riverina to breed sheep and cattle to feed the miners {{taking part in the}} Victorian Gold Rush. The herds were considered inferior at first, but these pastures were good for stock, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> which seemed a desert was actually good fattening country.|$|E
50|$|German {{immigrants}} in Brazil settled mostly in rural areas, called colonies (colônias in Portuguese). These colonies {{were created by}} <b>the</b> Brazilian government, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> were distributed among the immigrants. They had to construct their own houses <b>and</b> cultivate <b>the</b> <b>land.</b>|$|R

5|$|Following the Mexican War of Independence, the {{missions}} were secularized <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> {{taken by the}} Mexican government. In 1834, Lieutenant Antonio del Valle was assigned to inventory the property of Mission San Fernando. The rancho {{was supposed to be}} returned to the Tataviam, but Governor Alvarado deeded it to his friend Del Valle instead on January 22, 1839. The Del Valle family moved into the former estancia buildings (near what is now Castaic).|$|E
5|$|In 1835 George William Featherstonhaugh {{conducted}} a geological {{survey of the}} Minnesota River valley and wrote an account entitled A Canoe Voyage up the Minnay Sotor. Joseph Nicollet scouted {{the area in the}} late 1830s accompanied by John C. Frémont, exploring and mapping the Upper Mississippi River basin, the Saint Croix River, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> between the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the United Nations Development Programme, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and World Energy Council {{published}} {{an estimate of}} the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation, cloud cover, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> that is usable by humans. The estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of 1,575–49,837EJ per year (see table below).|$|E

5|$|Started in 1743 and {{originally}} {{known as}} Temple Park, Castle Park is located {{to the south}} of the castle. Its original name derived from the Knights Templar, who used to own a manor in Warwick. Houses {{around the perimeter of the}} park were demolished <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> they stood on incorporated into the park. Attempts to make profits from the park in the late 18th century included leasing it for grazing, growing wheat, and keeping sheep.|$|E
5|$|Terrain {{played a}} {{significant}} role in operations around Narva. The elevation above sea level rarely rises above 100 meters in the area <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> is cut by numerous waterways, including the Narva and Plyussa Rivers. The bulk of the land in the region is forested and large swamps inundate areas of low elevation. The effect of the terrain on operations was one of channelization; because of the swamps, only certain areas were suitable for large-scale troop movement.|$|E
5|$|The North Mountain House was {{threatened}} by a forest fire in 1900; the subsequent loss {{of much of the}} surrounding old-growth forest led to decreased numbers of hotel guests. In 1903 another large fire on North Mountain threatened the sawmill in the village of Ricketts. The wooden addition to the stone house was torn down in either 1897 or 1903, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> became a garden. The hotel closed in November 1903, and the fishing club and passenger train service ended with the closure.|$|E

5|$|The algae are a polyphyletic {{group and}} {{are placed in}} various divisions, some {{more closely related to}} plants than others. There are many {{differences}} between them in features such as cell wall composition, biochemistry, pigmentation, chloroplast structure and nutrient reserves. The algal division Charophyta, sister to the green algal division Chlorophyta, is considered to contain the ancestor of true plants. The Charophyte class Charophyceae <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> plant sub-kingdom Embryophyta together form the monophyletic group or clade Streptophytina.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} {{solar energy}} {{that could be}} used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography, time variation, cloud cover, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire.|$|E
5|$|The {{south side}} visitor entrance, which now houses a shop and visitor facilities, was {{previously}} the airfield's armoury.

50|$|Douglas {{is first}} heard of in 1320 when he {{received}} a charter of land at Morebattle in Roxburghshire and Kirkandrews in Dumfriesshire from King Robert. In 1324, he was recorded as being granted <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> of Rattray <b>and</b> Crimond in Buchan <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> of Conveth, Kincardineshire, already being possession of Cavers in Roxburghshire, Drumlanrig and Terregles in Dumfriesshire, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> of West Calder in Midlothian. By {{the time of his}} death, he was also in possession of Liddesdale.|$|R
5|$|When {{construction}} began, the River Moselle, running {{parallel to}} Lordship Lane {{a short distance}} south of it, formed the de facto northern boundary of the area. During {{the development of the}} area in the 1880s the river was culverted <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> between the river and Lordship Lane built on.|$|E
5|$|With the {{conclusion}} of the fighting, however, military budgets were slashed, and even the forts that were designated for second- and first-class status were deemed surplus. The guns were removed, surplus equipment sold, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> returned to its original owners. Fort Stanton itself was officially closed on March 20, 1866. Following the closure, the fort was abandoned to the elements, and the woods of Anacostia rapidly reclaimed the land.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} housebuilding programme {{started in}} the 1960s, and Radyr's population grew rapidly — particularly children. In 1964 Radyr Comprehensive School had 135 pupils on its roll. This number more than trebled in the next decade. A new development, the Danescourt estate, was built on land surrounding Radyr Court and St John the Baptist parish church, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> was officially incorporated as a suburb of Cardiff in 1974. Danybryn Woods, near the development, was retained as the entire forest is protected by a tree preservation order and is home to many species of plants and wildlife. Radyr railway station was renovated in 1998 and the tracks through the station were renewed, reducing journey times to Cardiff city centre.|$|E
5000|$|The town traces its {{beginnings}} {{to the middle}} of the eighteenth century. Explorers arrived <b>and</b> camped on <b>the</b> banks of a small river. The climate was mild, there was abundant water, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> were fertile. But the site had one defect: it was infested by clouds of a blood-sucking mosquito called Mutuca. For this reason <b>the</b> river <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> nearby were given the name [...] "Mutuca".|$|R
