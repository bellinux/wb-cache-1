5|$|Myers {{realised}} that normal, globe-shaped hot <b>air</b> <b>passenger</b> balloons {{were subject}} to the whim of {{the direction of the}} winds. He then thought that perhaps a passenger balloon could be controlled somehow to move against the flow. His first step in an evolution to a controllable balloon was the design of a large elongated spindle instead of a sphere. His theory was that a symmetrical wave line spindle body would have less head resistance when passing through the air than did a blunt globe.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong International Airport is {{a leading}} <b>air</b> <b>passenger</b> gateway and {{logistics}} hub in Asia {{and one of the}} world's busiest airports in terms of international passenger and cargo movement, serving more than 47million passengers and handling 3.74million tonnes (4.12million tons) of cargo in 2007. It replaced the overcrowded Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon in 1998, and has been rated as the world's best airport in a number of surveys. Over 85 airlines operate at the two-terminal airport and it is the primary hub of Cathay Pacific, Dragonair, Air Hong Kong, Hong Kong Airlines, and Hong Kong Express.|$|E
5|$|Manchester Airport {{serves as}} the main {{international}} hub for Northern England and is the busiest airport anywhere in the UK outside London, handling 25.6 million people in 2016. In total, there are seven international airports in the North; these are (in descending order of passenger traffic) Manchester, Newcastle, Liverpool John Lennon, Leeds Bradford, Doncaster Sheffield, Humberside and Durham Tees Valley. Many of these airports were developed during the boom in low-cost air travel during the early 2000s, but have suffered since the Great Recession – Durham Tees Valley is running at just 3% of its maximum capacity, and Blackpool Airport closed as an international airport in 2014. The devolution of <b>Air</b> <b>Passenger</b> Duty to Scotland represents a further possible threat to Northern English airports, allowing Scottish airports to offer cheaper flights than their English rivals. Few spoke flights operate between Northern airports and the national hubs at Heathrow and Gatwick, putting further strain on the smaller Northern airports and forcing connecting passengers to travel via continental European airports. The planned High Speed 2 station at Manchester Airport will offer direct high-speed services to London, allowing spare capacity at Manchester Airport {{to take some of}} the flights which currently serve busy London airports.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{direct impact on}} the UK economy, air {{transport}} is an £11.4billion industry, a figure which represents 1.1 per cent of the country’s economy. It employs 186,000 people (full-time equivalents), and indirectly supports an additional 334,000 jobs, although the inclusion of indirect employment as an economic benefit of air transport is disputed. In terms of productivity the aviation industry in 2004 was the third most productive, after the oil/gas extraction and utilities sectors, exceeding the national average {{by a factor of}} two and a half. The industry is also very capital intensive, accounting for up to 3.5 per cent of total UK business investment in the period 2000 to 2004. Air transport was directly responsible for £3.6billion in tax and national insurance contributions in 2004/5, which includes £0.9billion raised in <b>Air</b> <b>Passenger</b> Duty (APD), a figure set to double after APD rates were doubled in February 2007. Because of the global nature of the industry, article 15 of the Chicago Convention effectively prevents the imposition of fuel duty on aviation, and the industry does not pay Value Added Tax (VAT). Environmental groups argue that these, along with duty-free sales, are iniquitous tax concessions valued at £9billion annually. Despite generating £6.9billion in exports in 2004, representing 3 per cent of all UK exports and 7 per cent of the total export of services, the patronage in the UK of air transport services provided by overseas airlines resulted in a £3.3billion balance of payments deficit attributable to the industry.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change is}} the biggest {{challenge}} humanity has ever faced {{and there is no}} doubt that human activities are the main cause. One activity that has received much attention in this discussion is air transportation. Although its contribution is still moderate, this industry is growing at a very fast rate and with that its impact on climate change. In order to enjoy its social and economic benefits also in the future and to avoid regulatory restrictions, the industry’s contribution needs to be kept in check. Various mitigation strategies exist such as technological, market-based, operational, regulatory and behavioral changes. This dissertation focuses on behavioral change. One instrument leading towards behavioral {{change is the}} eco-label. This dissertation presents and examines the idea of introducing an eco- label for the airline industry. It has the following two objectives: 1) to study pre- requisites essential for the use of an eco-label in the airline industry and 2) to study the potential outcome an airline eco-label could have on the behavior of <b>air</b> <b>passengers</b> aiming at the mitigation of climate change. This dissertation is based on four articles and follows a mixed-method approach. It utilizes data from two surveys (N= 148, N= 554), 12 industry expert interviews and flight and fuel data from secondary sources. The results showed that it is difficult for <b>air</b> <b>passengers</b> to identify green flight options. However, <b>air</b> <b>passengers</b> actively selecting greener flight options can make a real difference as it was found that there are tremendous differences in the environmental performances of individual flights. An eco-label could promote behavioral change as it helps <b>air</b> <b>passengers</b> to easier identify greener flights. The results showed that an airline eco-label had influenced the booking decision of <b>air</b> <b>passengers</b> and led to behavioral change. <b>Air</b> <b>passengers</b> changing behavior would also demand the airline industry to improve its environmental performance. This could also lead to more environmental competition within the industry. Based on the findings a clear recommendation can be given to the airline industry to implement an industry wide eco-label. An eco-label would lead to behavioral change among <b>air</b> <b>passengers</b> which in turn would mean less emissions and a reduced impact of air transportation on climate change...|$|R

25|$|The ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASEAN-SAM) is the region's {{aviation}} policy geared {{towards the}} development of a unified and single aviation market in Southeast Asia. The aviation policy was proposed by the ASEAN Air Transport Working Group, supported by the ASEAN Senior Transport Officials Meeting, and endorsed by the ASEAN Transport Ministers. The ASEAN-SAM is expected to liberalise air travel between member-states in the ASEAN region, allowing ASEAN airlines to benefit directly from the growth in air travel, and also free up tourism, trade, investment, and service flows between member states. Since 1 December 2008, restrictions on the third and fourth freedoms of the air between capital cities of member states for <b>air</b> <b>passenger</b> services have been removed, while from 1 January 2009, full liberalisation of air freight services in the region took effect.
