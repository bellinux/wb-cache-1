5|$|St. Laurent had {{informed}} Diefenbaker that Parliament would be dissolved in April, for an election on June 10. A final parliamentary conflict was {{sparked by the}} suicide of Canadian Ambassador to Egypt E.H. Norman {{in the midst of}} allegations made by a United States Senate subcommittee that Norman had communist links. Pearson had defended Norman when the allegations became public, and defended him again after his death, suggesting to the Commons that the allegations were false. It quickly became apparent that the information released by the <b>Americans</b> <b>might</b> have come from Canadian intelligence sources, and after severe questioning of Pearson by Diefenbaker and the other parties' foreign policy critics, Pearson made a statement announcing that Norman had had communist associations in his youth, but had passed a security review. The minister evaded further questions regarding what information had been provided, and the discussion was cut short when Parliament was dissolved on April 12.|$|E
25|$|In the 2006 book Steel Drivin' Man: John Henry, the Untold Story of an American Legend, Scott Reynolds Nelson, an {{associate}} {{professor of history at the}} College of William & Mary, contends that the John Henry of the ballad was based on a different real person, the 20-year-old New Jersey-born African-American freeman, John William Henry. Nelson speculates that Henry, like many African <b>Americans</b> <b>might</b> have come to Virginia to work on the clean-up of the battlefields after the Civil War. Arrested and tried for burglary, he was among the many convicts released by the warden to work as leased labor on the C Railway.|$|E

25|$|The {{fear that}} the <b>Americans</b> <b>might</b> again attempt to conquer Canada {{remained}} a serious concern {{for at least the}} next half century, and was the chief reason for the retention of a large British garrison in the colony. From the 1820s to the 1840s, there was extensive construction of fortifications, as the British attempted to create strong points around which defending forces might centre in the event of an American invasion; these include the Citadels at Quebec City and Halifax, and Fort Henry in Kingston. The Rideau Canal was built to allow ships in wartime to travel a more northerly route from Montreal to Kingston; the customary peacetime route was the St. Lawrence River, which constituted the northern edge of the American border, and thus was vulnerable to enemy attack and interference.|$|E
25|$|Two {{settlers}} {{who were}} staying near Fort Antes {{were killed in}} June 1777. A party of four men and two women had left {{the safety of the}} fort and crossed the West Branch of the Susquehanna River to milk some cows that had been left there to pasture. Zephaniah Miller, Abel Cady, and James Armstrong left the riverbank and meadow to gather a cow who had wandered into the surrounding woods. These three men came under attack by a group of warriors who had been hiding in the woods. Sounds of fighting stirred the men at the fort. They crossed the river despite the objections of Colonel Antes who thought that the Native <b>Americans</b> <b>might</b> have set a trap. Upon reaching {{the other side of the}} river, the militiamen found Miller dead and Cady and Armstrong mortally wounded. Only Bouser and the women, one of them Cady's wife, survived the attack. This was just one of many attacks in the West Branch Valley that continued to make life more dangerous for the settlers, who were encroaching on tribal land.|$|E
25|$|The British advance {{was made}} by way of Lake Borgne, and the troops landed at a fisherman's village on December 23, 1814, Major-General Sir Edward Pakenham taking command there two days later (Christmas). An {{immediate}} advance on the still insufficiently-prepared defenses of the <b>Americans</b> <b>might</b> {{have led to the}} capture of the city; but this was not attempted, and both sides limited themselves to relatively small skirmishes and a naval battle while awaiting reinforcements. At last in the early morning of January 8, 1815 (after the Treaty of Ghent had been signed but before the news had reached across the Atlantic), a direct attack was made on the now strongly-entrenched line of defenders at Chalmette, near the Mississippi River. It failed disastrously with a loss of 2,000 out of 9,000 British troops engaged, among the dead being Pakenham and Major-General Gibbs. The expedition was soon afterwards abandoned and the troops embarked, under the command of John Lambert. Another engagement followed: a ten-day artillery battle at Fort St. Philip on the lower Mississippi River. The British fleet set sail on January 18 and went on to capture Fort Bowyer at the entrance to Mobile Bay.|$|E
60|$|I {{had thought}} Saul might strive {{to get even}} with Pierre by {{pointing}} out that the young French general was defeated where an <b>American</b> <b>might</b> have been victorious; but no, he held his peace concerning the nationality of the commander of the army, and seemed all afire with a desire to do something with his own hands that should be of benefit to the Cause.|$|R

During August-September 1958, she visited Crete and Turkey when the latter country was threatened. In 1959, she sailed 11 May for fleet replenishment {{in response to the}} heightened Berlin crisis, effectively showing <b>American</b> <b>might</b> and determination.

500|$|When war came, Davis, against Benjamin's advice, imposed {{an embargo}} on exports of cotton to nations {{that had not}} {{recognized}} the Confederate government, hoping to force such relations, especially with Britain and France. [...] As the Union was attempting to prevent cotton from being exported from Confederate ports by a blockade and other means, this played {{to a certain extent}} into the hands of Lincoln and his Secretary of State, William H. Seward. [...] Additionally, when the war began, Britain had a large surplus of cotton in warehouses, enough to keep the mills running at least part-time for a year or so. Although many prominent Britons believed the South would prevail, there was a reluctance to recognize Richmond until it had gained the military victories to put its foe at bay. [...] Much of this was due to hatred of slavery, though part of it stemmed from a desire to remain on good terms with the U.S. government—due to a drought in 1862, Britain was forced to import large quantities of wheat and flour from the United States. Also, Britain feared the expansionist <b>Americans</b> <b>might</b> invade the vulnerable Canadian colonies, as Seward hinted they might.|$|E
2500|$|The first Internet {{question}} {{came from}} a 78-year-old, as Brokaw pointed out, [...] "child of the Depression" [...] about sacrifices that <b>Americans</b> <b>might</b> have {{to make in the}} future.

2500|$|In Magic: The Untold Story of U.S. Intelligence and the Evacuation of Japanese Residents From the West Coast During World War II, David Lowman, {{a former}} National Security Agency (NSA) operative, argues that Magic ("Magic" [...] was the code-name for American code-breaking efforts) {{intercepts}} posed [...] "frightening specter of massive espionage nets," [...] thus justifying internment. Lowman contended that incarceration served {{to ensure the}} secrecy of U.S. code-breaking efforts, because effective prosecution of Japanese <b>Americans</b> <b>might</b> necessitate disclosure of secret information. If U.S. code-breaking technology was revealed {{in the context of}} trials of individual spies, the Japanese Imperial Navy would change its codes, thus undermining U.S. strategic wartime advantage.|$|E

2500|$|About {{three weeks}} after the {{publication}} of the Navy report, on February 19, 1942, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the War Department to create military areas from which any or all <b>Americans</b> <b>might</b> be excluded, and to provide for the necessary transport, lodging, and feeding of persons displaced from such areas. On March 2, 1942, the U.S. Army Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt, commander of the Western Defense Command, issued Public Proclamation No. 1, demarcating western military areas and the exclusion zones therein, and directing any [...] "Japanese, German, or Italian aliens" [...] and any person of Japanese descent to inform the U.S. Postal Service of any changes of residence. Further military areas and zones were demarcated in Public Proclamation No. 2.|$|E
2500|$|By April 1945, Germany faced {{its last}} days with 1.9 million German {{soldiers}} in the East fighting 6.4 million Red Army soldiers while 1 million German {{soldiers in the}} West battled 4 million Western Allied soldiers. While initial talk existed of a race to Berlin by the Allies, after Stalin successfully lobbied for Eastern Germany to fall within the Soviet [...] "sphere of influence" [...] at Yalta, no plans {{were made by the}} Western Allies to seize the city by a ground operation. Stalin still remained suspicious that western Allied forces holding at the Elbe River might move on the capital and, even in the last days, that the <b>Americans</b> <b>might</b> employ their two airborne divisions to capture the city.|$|E
2500|$|Historians {{agree that}} the Harpers Ferry raid {{escalated}} tensions that, a year later, led to the South's secession and Civil War. David Potter has said the emotional effect of Brown's raid was greater than the philosophical effect of the Lincoln–Douglas debates, and that it reaffirmed a deep division between North and South. Some writers, including Bruce Olds, describe him as a monomaniacal zealot; others, such as Stephen B. Oates, regard him as [...] "one of the most perceptive human beings of his generation". David S. Reynolds hails him {{as the man who}} [...] "killed slavery, sparked the civil war, and seeded civil rights" [...] and Richard Owen Boyer emphasizes that Brown was [...] "an American who gave his life that millions of other <b>Americans</b> <b>might</b> be free". [...] "John Brown's Body" [...] was a popular Union marching song during the Civil War and made him a martyr.|$|E
5000|$|Shurin's poetics {{might be}} {{described}} as a poetics of the voice in the tradition of Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson and of those who followed. Writes Shurin: [...] An <b>American</b> inheritance <b>might</b> include Whitman's polyglot impetus toward people speaking in their own voices, bringing poetic diction down from England's on high and into the streets (but that's an impulse already at least as old as Dante.)... An <b>American</b> inheritance <b>might</b> include Dickinson's fierce commitment to individual volition and despair, to her reworking of traditional forms to accept interruption and levels of psychic intuition.|$|R

2500|$|In May 1996, PC Graphics Report {{interviewed a}} Japanese {{executive}} associated with Bandai.

In particular, computer illiterate people did not know what an [...] "@" [...] sign was, as in @WORLD. Consumers in America could not grasp the idea of surfing the Internet using such a device. The executive could not understand how <b>Americans</b> <b>might</b> not be interested in surfing the Internet. Even among internet surfers, the Apple Pippin was not necessarily the console of choice. A July 1996 article in Electronic Gaming Monthly pointed out that the competing Sega Saturn and its separately sold Netlink device combined still cost under $400, making it a far less expensive internet option than the Pippin. And, any device that wasn't simple to use would be a failure in the U.S. market.|$|E
2500|$|After {{consulting}} with General Fulton, Colonel David concluded {{that if an}} operation was launched around Cam Son on 15 September, the <b>Americans</b> <b>might</b> {{be able to find}} the 514th Local Force Battalion. The plan was to attack the area in central Cam Son; previous operations had yielded evidence that it was the location of the communists' heaviest fortifications. In order to not alert the communists and give them time to escape, David decided to withhold preparatory and reconnaissance fire until the American assault craft passed a wide curve in the Rach Ba Rai referred to as [...] "Snoopy's Nose". Helicopter flights over the area were to be limited until the assault craft passed Snoopy's Nose. The movement of the 5th Battalion, 60th Infantry by ground vehicles into the Cam Son area from Cai Lậy was to be delayed until the 3d Battalion, 60th Infantry, and 3d Battalion, 47th Infantry, entered the Rach Ba Rai aboard armored troop carriers (ATCs). Finally, to provide a higher degree of flexibility in case the Vietcong was found, the 2d Battalion, 60th Infantry, 3d Brigade, was designated a reserve force by the 9th Division. If required, this battalion from the 9th Division would be employed by helicopter, staging from Đồng Tâm after moving from the battalion's base in Long An Province.|$|E
60|$|After lunch {{the flat}} shore at Cuxhaven was so near that the summer cottages {{of the little}} watering-place showed through the warm drizzle much like the summer cottages of our own shore, and {{if it had not}} been for the strange, low sky, the <b>Americans</b> <b>might</b> easily have fancied {{themselves}} at home again.|$|E
60|$|An {{incident}} in S. C. Hall's Ireland, {{of a stone}} cross, buried in Cromwell's time, to prevent its destruction by his soldiers.

60|$|And {{then there}} are the {{republicans}}--men of the real olden time, capable of sacrificing every thing that heart holds dear for a principle; such republicans as were our fathers in all, save their religion, and because lacking that, losing the chief element of popular control.

60|$|They were yet {{a hundred}} feet from the cottage when two American {{soldiers}} came rushing forth, guns in hand.

The films asserts such trends are being repeated in America today, {{and puts the}} recent gradual loss of civil liberties in the U.S. in a historical context. [...] "The average <b>American</b> <b>might</b> not be alarmed at AT&T selling our private information to the Bush administration, but when this action is {{seen as part of}} a larger series of erosions and events, a pattern emerges with unfortunate consequences that become disturbingly clear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Still," [...] rejoined Mr. Mountford, with a {{smile that}} Redclyffe fancied was dark and subtle, [...] "still, I should imagine that even an <b>American</b> <b>might</b> recall so much of {{hereditary}} prejudice as to be sensible of some earthly advantages in the possession of an ancient title and hereditary estate like this. Personal distinction may suit you better,--to be an Ambassador by your own talent; to have a future for yourself, involving the possibility of ranking (though it were only for four years) among the acknowledged sovereigns of the earth;--this is very good. But if the silver key would open the shut up secret to-day, it might be possible that you would relinquish these advantages." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>American</b> humor <b>might</b> also be {{distinguished}} by its {{most common type}} of humor, for example, more slapstick and physical comedy.
