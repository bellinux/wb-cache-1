40|$|Background and Purpose: Better {{processes}} in stroke care {{are assumed to}} lead to better stroke outcomes. We sought to test whether current measures of stroke process are related to measures of stroke outcome. Methods: This was a prospective study of consecutive patients with acute stroke admitted {{to each of the}} 3 general hospitals in 1 region who were followed up for 12 months after hospital discharge. Process was measured by use of the Royal College of Physicians Stroke <b>Audit</b> <b>Package,</b> and outcomes were measured with a range of disability, health status, handicap, and independence measures, as well as mortality. Results: One hundred eighty-one patients were recruited. There was evidence for a relationship between some process variables and outcomes at hospital discharge, but the relationships were generally weak. None of the process variables remained in regression models of functional outcomes at 12 months. The hospital with the best process scores had the worst case mix-adjusted outcomes. Conclusions: The link between stroke process and outcome, through the use of currently available measures of process such as the Royal College of Physicians Stroke <b>Audit</b> <b>Package,</b> is not straightforward. Ongoing work may clarify some of these issues and provide guidance to stroke clinicians on how best to improve existing services...|$|E

40|$|Background There are few data {{regarding}} {{the standard of}} stroke care in Ireland. Aim To investigate the level of documentation for 13 key areas of stroke management. Methods Using a validated stroke <b>audit</b> <b>package,</b> this study reviewed the medical records of 100 consecutive patients hospitalised with acute stroke. Results Documentation of stroke symptoms, risk factors, general examination and investigations (cranial computer tomography [CT] and carotid Dopplers) were satisfactory. Neurological documentation was variable, with power (87 %), sensation (70 %) and eye movements (63 %) being the most frequently recorded features, while cognition (3 %), visual fields (13 %), gait (7 %), incontinence (1 %) and swallowing (0 %) were infrequently recorded. Diagnostic formulation and an acute management plan were documented in {{less than half of}} patients, whereas cranial CT (93 %) and carotid Dopplers (93 %) were well documented. Secondary preventive measures were documented in two-thirds of patients at follow-up. Conclusions These results serve as a baseline from which to initiate and monitor improvements in the service at our hospital, including the involvement of neurologists in stroke care, and will also allow assessment of the impact of such changes...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the uptake and use by general {{practitioners}} of a free epilepsy audit protocol, and describe the care provided by practices which returned completed audits. A protocol for epilepsy audit in general practice was designed and described in the medical press. Practices were invited to reply. Responders were provided with the protocol. A total of 215 practices responded to the articles in the press. Questionnaires asking how they had used the audit protocol were sent to them 18 months later. One hundred and seventy (79 %) of the 215 responding practices returned the questionnaires. Forty-seven-(28 %) had collected {{some or all of}} the data. Twenty-two (13 %) submitted data of which 12 (7 %) matched the original protocol. Aggregated list sizes for these 12 practices was 75 689 and 502 (0. 66 %) patients were being treated. Of these, 60 % were seizure free and 11 % were having more than one seizure per month. Seventy-one were receiving monotherapy and only two patients were taking more than three drugs. Eighty-eight per cent of patients still having seizures had been seen by their GP for their epilepsy in the last 12 months. In 18 % of cases, information on epilepsy lifestyle issues had been given and noted.

40|$|This {{overview}} gives {{a summary}} of the research started 15 years ago in relation to the developments within the audit and governance environment. The developments focus on their impact on public sector audit activity and how these developments have been embedded in higher education (HE) programmes. The research and subsequent outputs have contributed to the introduction of innovative teaching methods that reflect contemporary developments in the audit profession. In introducing these developments the teaching approach for audit orientated modules has moved away from a didactic approach to experiential learning approach. This submission includes material from eight refereed published journal articles, one refereed paper presented at a conference and a chapter from a textbook. In addition, other journal publications and conference papers, which were presented at both national and international conferences, are mentioned as contributions to knowledge. At the time of submission of this work, one paper was under review for publication. While related areas of research were ongoing in respect of audit training within the profession and audit committees within Housing Associations. The period of research activity spans the years 1995 – to 2011. These outputs cover three key areas in terms of contribution to learning. The first area looks at the design and development of a case study as a teaching medium focusing on experiential (hands on) learning as the basis for a module on computer auditing. This was based on research into the practical audit approaches within the public sector. The public sector was the focus of the initial research as it had a requirement for the presence of an internal audit function. This focus on the public sector focus continued into subsequent research. The application of audit techniques to provide a better appreciation of auditing was introduced into module development {{as a consequence of the}} research findings. This specifically applied information technology (IT) as a tool for audit which was embedded in a case study, and more recently for forensic accounting purposes. The use of MS Office Excel as a teaching medium was used initially to replicate <b>audit</b> software <b>packages</b> and referred to as ‘Excel as an audit tool’. This was later replaced by commercial audit software using datasets. The second theme considers the impact of policies by government relating to aspects of accountability, value for money and performance measurement, again with an emphasis on the public sector audit function in verifying data used as indicators. The third area examines the working relationship between internal audit and the audit committee, with a focus on the influence of corporate governance codes on internal control requirements and risk management. All three areas identify the changing face of audit as a consequence of external pressures such as IT developments, accountability requirements, pressures on limited resources and government codes of best practice recommendations and guidelines. The integration of these developments in to HE focused initially on undergraduate modules within the BA (Hons) Accounting and Finance programme. The developments were later integrated into post graduate modules as well as acting as an information conduit for local government in Wales. The link between all three themes is that of the changes facing the audit profession and how these have been incorporated into the teaching of audit at HE level. These changes reflect the audit role in terms of the adoption of a proactive approach to responding, not only to the application of technology, but also to both public and government expectations in terms of indirect and direct requirements. This nexus between the themes is further enhanced by the use of audited information conveyed electronically for the purpose of performance verification of targets and the relationship between the efficient use of resources and good governance approaches. The recognition of the research output in the early stages was reinforced in 1998 by the award of Research Fellow from Grant Thornton and involvement with the Welsh Chief Auditors Group (WCAG) which resulted in the research focusing on Welsh local government. Further research has incorporated forensic auditing techniques and the internal audit function in the corporate arena. These were further utilised within the innovative and ground breaking development of the BA (Hons) Forensic Accounting programme. While the corporate governance work has taken the international route of comparing corporate governance codes of best practice and formed an important element within the post graduate programmes of MSc Accounting, MSc Forensic Accounting and MSc Management and Development of International Financial Systems. Funded consultancy work has produced professional body reports on the training of professional auditors in contrast to the academic development of teaching material with journal papers contributing to the knowledge of both the HE community and practitioners. Finally the research and development of lecture material has been utilised for a joint publication of a textbook on auditing entitled Auditing Fundamentals (Davies & Aston 2010). This document discusses the three themes by critiquing how the changing face of auditing influences the design and delivery of auditing modules within accounting programmes, in the context of higher education. The collection and analysis of data, and especially practitioner views, form part of the background to the research method adopted. The output and findings provide the basis of the contribution to knowledge which informs HE practice and the profession. The research output has contributed to enhancing both undergraduate and post graduate teaching material as well as reports to parties outside the higher education environment. The contribution to knowledge has been threefold, where the HE environment of undergraduate and postgraduate students have been exposed to current developments in auditing, along with an opportunity to learn via experiential learning techniques. Members of the profession have been enlightened on the issues affecting their working practices via conferences and training seminars. Finally management have capitalised on the research output and utilised this to make informed decisions. Further research opportunities have arisen as a direct result of research undertaken whilst other opportunities for disseminating knowledge and information have occurred via representations on various bodies and working parties including media interviews. ...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the push}} for reform in the Australian public sector audit has placed the Office of the Auditor-General (hereafter OAG) in a more {{contestable}} or market- like environment, where the OAG is accountable for an efficient and effective provision of public sector audit. The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare the cost efficiency of in-house and contract-out arrangements to deliver financial audits in the public sector. It empirically tests whether there are audit cost and audit fee differences between in-house providers (i. e., the OAG) and contractors (i. e., public accounting firms). The secondary aims of this study are to develop audit cost and fee models for the public sector. The unit of analysis is audit cost/fee at the audit engagement level. The data for this study is collected for a sample of financial statement audit engagements for year-end 1998, at the state level in Western Australia. The data is extracted from publicly available and private sources. The audit cost and fee models are used to test for the cost differences between in- house providers and contractors. Prior audit production and audit fee studies in the private and public sectors provide the basis for the development of the two models. The results indicate that agency size, complexity and risk are positively associated with audit costs and audit fees. In addition, the total advice provided to the agencies by the OAG and agency type are also significantly associated with audit costs and audit fees. Overall, by incorporating these factors into the models, the audit cost model explains 82 percent of the variance in audit costs, while the audit fee model explains 86 percent of the variance in audit fees. More importantly, the main findings suggest that contract-out audits are more costly than in-house audits. However, this finding is conditional on agency type. Further analysis reveals that the type of audit arrangement is significantly associated with audit costs for the statutory authority audits only. There is no significant difference in audit costs between contract-out and in-house arrangement for hospital audits. This analysis shows that the statutory authority audits are driving the significance of the interaction between type of audit arrangement and agency type. Specifically, the costs of contract-out audits are, on average, significantly higher than in-house audits. This result is attributed to the contractor 2 ̆ 7 s lack of expertise in auditing statutory authority as there is no equivalent of this agency type in the private sector. As such, the OAG bas the greater advantage of delivering a lower audit cost for statutory authority audits compared to the contractors. However, the non-significant interaction term in the audit fee model suggests that cost differences between in-house and contract-out audits for the statutory authority audits are not reflected in audit fees billed to agencies. Further analyses, using audit hours as the dependent variable, generally corroborate the findings from the audit cost and audit fee models. Sensitivity analyses on the OAG 2 ̆ 7 s supervision costs reveal that these costs have a significant effect on the interpretation of the cost efficiency results. By excluding supervision costs from contract-out audits, there are significant changes in the results for the total sample and the two sub-samples (partitioned by agency type). Generally, these changes favour the contract-out audits for all groupings, where contract-out audits are now more cost efficient than in-house audits for hospitals, and not significantly different in costs for statutory authority audits. Additional tests to investigate the determinants of the GAG 2 ̆ 7 s supervision costs in contract-out audits reveal that agency size, risk, reliance on internal control, total advice provided by the OAG and <b>packaged</b> <b>audits</b> (a single contract for two or more audits) are significantly associated with the supervision costs of contract-out audits. The main contribution of this study is to add to the growing literature on audit market efficiency (see Dopuch, Gupta, Simunic 2 ̆ 6 Stein, 2000; Knechel 2 ̆ 6 Payne, forthcoming). It provides evidence on the production function of different type of suppliers in the public sector and their relative efficiency in providing audit services. This study contributes to the recent discussions on the changing nature of public sector audit market towards a market-based provision of public sector audits. The evidence from this study allows researchers and policy-makers to compare the two types of audit arrangement to undertake public sector audits. In pan, this study also contributes to the line of inquiry that examines the difference between government auditors and public accounting firms in US municipalities (Copley, 1989; Dwyer 2 ̆ 6 Wilson, 1989; Rubin, 1992). The secondary contribution of this study is to develop and test the audit cost and fee models in the public sector and provide validity on the transferability of audit models from the private and public sectors. This study adds to the literature that examines the public sector audit market. More importantly, it is one of the few non-US studies that examine the public sector audit market and the findings from this study suggest that the public sector audit studies from the US are generalisable to Australia. These findings add to our understanding of the range of market conditions under which it is so far known to hold...|$|R
