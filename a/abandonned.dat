50|$|Unexploded {{ordnance}} (UXO, sometimes abbreviated as UO), unexploded bombs (UXBs), or explosive {{remnants of}} war (ERW) are explosive weapons (bombs, shells, grenades, land mines, naval mines, cluster munition, etc.) {{that did not}} explode when they were employed and still pose a risk of detonation, sometimes many decades after they were used or discarded. UXO does not always originate from wars, areas such as military training grounds can also hold significant numbers, even after the area has been <b>abandonned.</b> UXO from World War I {{continue to be a}} hazard, with poisonous gas filled munitions still a problem.

Delgado Chalbaud was twice a betrayer, but Venezuelan historians tend to speak well of him, analogously as they argue in America that John F. Kennedy would not have allowed the Vietnam War to escalate. But both positions are counterfactual, hence un-provable. What is often said is that Delgado Chalbaud was planning to restore Venezuelan democracy. If that was his intention, he did not get the chance to accomplish it. He was kidnapped and assassinated on 13 November 1950, by a group led by Rafael Simon Urbina and his nephew Domingo Urbina. The kidnapping took place in Caracas between the neighborhoods of Country Club and Chapellin, and his murder took place in Las Mercedes neigborhood, semi <b>abandonned</b> at this time.|$|E
50|$|A project {{feasibility}} {{study is a}} comprehensive report that examines in detail the five frames of analysis of a given project. It also takes into considerationits 4 Ps, its risks and POVs, and its contraints (calendar, costs, and norms of quality). The goal is {{to determine whether the}} project should go ahead, be redesigned, or else <b>abandonned</b> altogether.. The five frames of analysis are: the frame of definition; the frame of contextual risks; the frame of potentiality; the parametric frame and the frame of dominant and contigency strategies.The 4 Ps are traditionally defined as Plan, Processes, People and Power. The risks are considered to be external to the project (e.g. weather conditions) and are divided in eight categories: (Plan): financial and organizational (e.g, government structure for a private project); (Processes) environmental and technological; (People) marketing and sociocultural; and (Power) legal and political. POVs are Points of vulnerability: they differ from risks {{in the sense that they}} are internal to the project and can be controlled or else eliminated.The constraints are the standard constraints of calendar, costs and norms of quality that can each be objectively determined and measured along the entire project lifecycle. Depending on projects, portions of the study may suffice to produce a {{feasibility study}}; smaller projects, for example, may not require an exhaustive environmental assessment.|$|E

He moved back to London & in the early eighties taught in various institutions, such as the University of Maryland’s UK campuses, while expanding his career as a freelance writer and translator, reviewing, for instance, for the New Statesman, for which publication he also briefly wrote a “Letter from Paris,” and working as editor and writer for the Third World weekly al-Zahaf al-Akhdar. Relocating to Paris, Joris started working as author, commentator, actor & editor for France Culture, the National French radio station. During those years he would return annually to the U.S. for poetry readings and work with various collaborators on a range of translation projects. [...] In 1987, invited by the Iowa International Writing Program (the first Luxemburger to be thus invited) to spend the fall in Iowa City, he used the occasion to relocate to the US. He first moved from Iowa to Binghamton, N.Y., where he started a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature he was to complete in 1990; from there he moved to San Diego where he was active as visiting poet in the University of California, San Diego Literature Department. A range of projects started at this time: besides completing several collections of poems & a first volume of essays, Joris started a very fruitful collaboration with poet and anthologist Jerome Rothenberg. In 1993 the pair co-edited and co-translated pppppp : THE SELECTED WRITINGS OF KURT SCHWITTERS (Temple University Press) which received the 1994 Pen Center USA West Award for Translation, and the following year a Selected Poems of Pablo Picasso, under the title The Death of the Count of Orgaz & Other Writings. Joris and Rothenberg also began work on a two volume anthology of 20th Century Avant-Garde writings, POEMS FOR THE MILLENNIUM: A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BOOK OF MODERN & POSTMODERN POETRY, the first volume of which was published by UCP in 95 and the second in 98. [...] In 1992 Joris returned to the Mid-Hudson valley to take up a teaching post in the Department of English at SUNY-Albany, where he taught until his retirement in 2013. In 2009 he moved to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he lives with his wife Nicole Peyrafitte, a performance artist, painter & singer. The pair continue to collaborate in a range of ways, including performances with jazz musicians & co-teaching, for example in the summer sessions at the Jack Kerouac Institute at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado. Peyrafitte has also illustrated and created covers for most of Joris’ books since 1992.|$|E
