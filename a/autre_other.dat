5000|$|Following Derrida, John Caputo {{describes}} khôra as:neither present nor absent, active or passive, {{the good}} nor evil, living nor nonliving - but rather atheological and nonhuman - khôra {{is not even}} a receptacle. Khôra has no meaning or essence, no identity to fall back upon. She/it receives all without becoming anything, which is why she/it can become the subject of neither a philosopheme nor mytheme. In short, the khôra is tout <b>autre</b> <b>other,</b> very. [...] If, as one contributor concludes, KHÔRA means SPACE, it is an interesting space that [...] "at times appears to be neither this nor that, at times both this and that," [...] wavering [...] "between the logic of exclusion and that of participation." [...] (Derrida, The Name, 89).|$|E

5000|$|The 1984 International Games for the Disabled, canonically the 1984 Summer Paralympics {{were the}} seventh Paralympic Games to be held. They {{were in fact}} two {{separate}} competitions - one in Stoke Mandeville, United Kingdom for wheelchair athletes with spinal cord injuries and the other at the Mitchel Athletic Complex and Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, United States of America for wheelchair and ambulatory athletes with cerebral palsy, amputees, and les <b>autres</b> <b>others</b> (conditions as well as {{blind and visually impaired}} athletes). Stoke Mandeville had been the location of the Stoke Mandeville Games from 1948 onwards, seen as the precursors to the Paralympic Games.As with the 1984 Summer Olympics, the Soviet Union and other communist countries except China, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia boycotted the Paralympic Games.|$|R
50|$|Foucault's elaborations on heterotopias were {{published}} in an article entitled Des espaces <b>autres</b> (Of <b>Other</b> Spaces). The philosopher calls for a society with many heterotopias, {{not only as a}} space with several places of/for the affirmation of difference, but also as a means of escape from authoritarianism and repression, stating metaphorically that if we take the ship as the utmost heterotopia, a society without ships is inherently a repressive one, in a clear reference to Stalinism.|$|R
50|$|Wols' {{painting}} style, {{as early}} as 1946-47 (Untitled, 1946-47, Yellow Composition, 1946-7; Berlin, Neue N.G., It's All Over The City, 1947), was informal, gestural, with the paint applied in layers by means of dripping and with scratching into the surface. This new development in art proved influential, earning him the praise of artists such as Georges Mathieu and critics such as Michel Tapié, who coined the term Art <b>autre</b> (the <b>Other</b> Art) to describe the new style.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to focus on}} one of the main {{characteristics}} of Annie Ernaux's works, namely the blurring of boundaries between self and others. Basing my approach on Rimbaud's famous Je est un autre ("I is another person") as well as on Foucault's definition of transgression as a blurring of boundaries, I examine the various levels of transgression at work in Ernaux. My methodology includes a study of thematic and stylistic features, narrative strategies and identity, intextextuality, paratext and reader-response. My corpus includes not only Ernaux's works of fiction, semi-fiction or autobiography, but also various critical or journalistic pieces as well as interviews, including an unpublished interview with the writer. The structure of my thesis reflects the blurring of boundaries between the private and the public spheres in Ernaux's works. Starting with the divisions at work within the first person (chapter 1), I then examine a semi-private sphere- the world of characters inspired by real life and by fiction - in chapter 2. The last three chapters explore more public areas: reader-responses (chapter 3), the interactions between the first person and the critics (chapter 4), and finally the potential of journaux- diaries as well as journalistic writings- in Ernaux (chapter 5). In conclusion, I argue that the narrative voice in Ernaux is not only transpersonal, but also transgressive and trans-generic, and that the acts of reading and writing {{lie at the heart of}} the links between je (I) and les <b>autres</b> (<b>others)</b> ...|$|R

In 1150 the elder Tibors died and by her will left Raimbaut, then a minor, under the {{guardianship}} of her elder daughter and her son-in-law, the trobairitz' second husband, Bertran dels Baus. The younger sister, Tiburgette, was the recipient of a wedding gift from their father in that year (1150). In the will of her father, Guilhem, Tibors {{is referred to as}} <b>autre</b> Tiburge (the <b>other</b> Tibors), while her younger sister is given pre-eminence.|$|R
40|$|This book {{offers an}} {{investigation}} into the Christological ideas of three contemporary thinkers: Slavoj Zizek, Gianni Vattimo and Rene Girard. In the wake of Heidegger's announcement of the end of onto-theology and inspired by both Levinas and Derrida, many contemporary continental philosophers of religion search for a post-metaphysical God, a God who is often characterized as tout <b>autre,</b> wholly <b>other.</b> The Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek is an exception to this rule. First, he clearly has another source of inspiration: neither Heidegger, Levinas or Derrida, but Lacan and the great thinkers of German Idealism (Kant, Schelling, and Hegel). Moreover, he does not aim at tracing a post-metaphysical God. His 'turn' to Christianity is the result of his concern to 'save' the achievements of modernity from fundamentalism, post-modern relativism and religious obscurantism. The Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo is an intermediary. His sources (mainly Nietzsche and Heidegger) seem to indicate that he aligns with those philosophers whose works are inspired by Heidegger, Levinas and Derrida. Indeed, Vattimo is also searching for the God who comes after metaphysics, but he explicitly rejects the wholly-other God. With Zizek, Vattimo shares a Christological interest, an attention for the event of the Incarnation and the conviction that the Incarnation amounts to the end of God's transcendence. Both thinkers also defend the uniqueness of Christianity vis-a-vis natural religiosity. In this way, they seem to share at least some affinity with the views of the French-American literary critic and fundamental anthropologist Rene Girard, who has also defended the uniqueness of Christianity and claims that the latter broke away from the violent transcendence of the natural religions. The book will investigate the Christological ideas of these three contemporary thinkers, focussing on the topics of the relation between transcendence and the event of the Incarnation on the one hand, and the topic of the uniqueness of Christianity on the other. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to analyze the}} concepts of otredad &# 91;otherness&# 93; as defined by Octavio Paz, l’Autre et l’absolument <b>Autre</b> &# 91;the <b>other</b> and the absolute other&# 93;, by Emmanuel Lévinas and l’être en-soi, l’être pour-soi et l’être pour-autrui &# 91;being-in-itself, being-for-itself and being-for others&# 93;, by Jean-Paul Sartre in contemporary literature. The following books were analyzed: Paz’s El arco y la lira &# 91;The bow and the lyre&# 93; and La otra voz &# 91;The other voice&# 93;; Lévinas’s Autrement qu’être ou au-delà de l’essence &# 91;Otherwise than being: or beyond essence&# 93; and Sartre’s L’être et le néant &# 91;Being and nothingness&# 93;, in which the processes of surpassing the cognoscent subject by the Other (in different modes of action) are more intensely shown. Este ensaio busca rastrear os conceitos de otredad (Octavio Paz) outrem e absolutamente outro (Emmanuel Lévinas) e Em-si, Para-si e Para-outro (Jean-Paul Sartre) na literatura contemporânea a partir das reflexões desses pensadores no que se refere às diferentes formas de outramento pela palavra “literária” e “filosófica”. Para tanto, foram analisados, especialmente, os livros El arco y la lira e La otra voz (PAZ, 1986, 1990); Autrement qu’être ou au-delà de l’essence (LEVINAS, 1974) e O ser e o nada (SARTRE, 1997) nos quais se evidenciam, de forma mais intensa, os processos de ultrapassagem do sujeito cognoscente pelo Outro (em diferentes modalidades de atuação) ...|$|R
