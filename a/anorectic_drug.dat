50|$|Fenfluramine, {{a related}} drug, had been {{withdrawn}} from the market in 1997 after reports of heart valve disease, pulmonary hypertension, and development of cardiac fibrosis. This side effect is mediated by the metabolite norfenfluramine on 5HT2B receptors of heart valves (Rothman et al., Circulation 2000), leading to a characteristic pattern of heart failure following proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts on the tricuspid valve. Both fenfluramine and benfluorex form norfenfluramine as a metabolite.

25|$|The 5-HT2c {{receptor}} agonist Fenfluramine (market names Pondimin, Ponderax and Adifax) {{was discovered in}} 1972 {{as a result of}} research performed to identify anorectic compounds lacking the effects of psycho-stimulants and sympathomimetic agents (such as amphetamines). Prior to the discovery of fenfluramine, amphetamines were the primary form of <b>anorectic</b> <b>drugs</b> available, however the side effects made them difficult to use. Fenfluramine's anorectic effect is achieved through an increase in serotonin levels, imparting a sensation of fullness, which leads to a lower intake of food. Fenfluramine was sold as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, dexfenfluramine and levofenfluramine.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} two <b>anorectic</b> <b>drugs,</b> {{dexfenfluramine}} and phentermine, on food intake under different food-access conditions were examined. Experiment 1 compared {{the effects of}} these drugs on food intake under a progressive-ratio (PR) schedule and free-access conditions. Dexfenfluramine decreased food intake under both conditions, but the doses required to decrease intake under free-access conditions were higher than those required to reduce intake under the PR condition. Intermediate doses of phentermine sometimes increased breaking points, and higher doses decreased them. Phentermine decreased food intake at the same doses under both access conditions. Thus the potency of dexfenfluramine, but not phentermine, to decrease food-maintained behavior depended upon the food-access condition. Experiment 2 used a novel mixed progressive-ratio schedule of food delivery to study the duration of drug effects. Sessions consisted of five components separated by 3 -hr timeouts. The ratio requirement reset {{at the beginning of each}} component and a new breaking point was obtained. Both dexfenfluramine and phentermine dose-dependently decreased breaking points early in the session. In some rats, compensatory increases in breaking point were observed. That is, breaking points later in the session increased over control levels, resulting in no change in the total number of food pellets earned for the session compared to control. The present findings suggest that the effects of some <b>anorectic</b> <b>drugs</b> depend upon the access conditions for food; increasing the effort to obtain food may enhance their ability to decrease food-maintained behavior...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-controlled {{studies have}} noted a high {{prevalence}} of valvular regurgitation {{in patients with}} Chinese herb nephropathy; most of these patients had taken appetite suppressants. We aimed to determine the prevalence of valvular regurgitation {{and the role of}} appetite suppressants in patients with Chinese herb nephropathy. METHODS: This case-controlled echocardiographic study included 40 patients with end-stage renal failure due to Chinese herb nephropathy and 37 age-matched controls with end-stage renal disease due to nephropathy of other origin. Quantification of cumulative doses of appetite suppressants was performed. RESULTS: Aortic regurgitation was detected in 52. 5 % of patients with Chinese herb nephropathy, 72 +/- 1 months after stopping appetite suppressants, and in 21. 6 % of controls (P= 0. 009). No difference was found in the incidence of mitral or tricuspid regurgitation. A history of slimming medication was the only significant determinant for aortic regurgitation (P= 0. 009). Higher cumulative doses of Chinese herbs, (dex) fenfluramine and diethylpropion were observed in patients with Chinese herb nephropathy with, when compared to those without, aortic regurgitation. The dose-response relationship between the cumulative dose of drugs and the presence of aortic regurgitation was significant for fenfluramine only (chi-square= 5. 16, P= 0. 024). CONCLUSIONS: Six years after stopping appetite suppressants, aortic regurgitation remains highly prevalent among patients with end-stage Chinese herb nephropathy.

Besides, there is the pressure of society and the media for a slim look, and all these factors have led to an overuse of <b>anorectics</b> <b>drugs</b> with purely aesthetic purpose, without concerns for the danger of uncontrolled use. Thus, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of use of anorectics among scholars of both sexes enrolled at the first period of the courses {{in the area of}} health in a private institution of higher education in the city of Montes Claros - MG.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The International Narcotics Control Board {{released}} its 2005 annual report, highlighting the Brazil population {{as one of}} the largest consumers of anorectics. In Brazil, the National Health Surveillance Agency issued the resolution RDC 58 / 2007 in order to control the prescription and sale of such drugs. In Belém, the biggest city in the Brazilian Amazon region, this resolution came into force in 2008, leading to inspections of drugstores and magistral pharmacies. The aim of this work was to evaluate the consumption of psychotropic <b>anorectic</b> <b>drugs</b> and the impact of RDC 58 / 2007 on the prescription and dispensing of anorectics in drugstores and magistral pharmacies in Belém. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective quantitative and descriptive study was conducted of records from the Municipal Department of Health Surveillance of Belém, for 2005 to 2008. The differences in findings were regarded significant when p < 0. 05. RESULTS: A total of 1, 641 balance sheets of drugstores and magistral pharmacies were analyzed. Amfepramone was the most dispensed medication, followed by fenproporex and mazindol. The highest consumption of anorectics occurred in magistral pharmacies. In 2008, there was a significant reduction in dispensing of anorectics, in drugstores as well as in magistral pharmacies. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that there was a decrease in the dispensing of anorectics after RDC 58 / 2007 came into force, and that the magistral pharmacies dispensed more of these drugs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Obesity poses {{a serious}} health hazard and its {{treatment}} is often disappointing. This review describes the present status of pharmacological treatment of obesity in man. DESIGN: Obesity treatment may include drugs that reduce food intake, drugs that increase energy expenditure and drugs that affect nutrient partitioning or metabolism. The mode of action, efficacy {{and safety of}} each approach will be briefly discussed. RESULTS: All of the pharmacological possibilities have potential activities, but also serious limitations. While current anti-obesity pharmacotherapy essentially uses centrally-acting <b>anorectic</b> <b>drugs,</b> severe side-effects (more particularly pulmonary hypertension and valvular heart disease) have been reported, leading to the withdrawal of licensed fenfluramine and d-fenfluramine. New approaches have been recently proposed, such as sibutramine, an amine reuptake inhibitor which decreases food intake, and orlistat, an intestinal lipase inhibitor which decreases fat absorption. Obesity is a chronic disease and {{should be treated as}} such with reasonable expectations. Large-scale one-year placebo-controlled studies demonstrated that d-fenfluramine, sibutramine and orlistat significantly increased body weight loss by an average of 2 - 4 kg when compared to placebo and, more interestingly, multiplied by 2 - 3 the number of patients who succeeded in obtaining and maintaining a reduction of more than 10 % of initial body weight. Interestingly, some of these compounds may also exert favourable effects on other vascular risk factors, independently of weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: Even if all anti-obesity pharmacological approaches can be helpful, they also have important limitations so that other strategies including either combined therapies or new drugs (peptides) are currently under investigation.
