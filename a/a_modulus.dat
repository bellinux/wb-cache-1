25|$|When the {{appropriate}} conditions above are satisfied {{a system is}} said to be asymptotically stable; the variables of an asymptotically stable control system always decrease from their initial value and do not show permanent oscillations. Permanent oscillations occur when a pole has a real part exactly equal to zero (in the continuous time case) or <b>a</b> <b>modulus</b> equal to one (in the discrete time case). If a simply stable system response neither decays nor grows over time, and has no oscillations, it is marginally stable; in this case the system transfer function has non-repeated poles at the complex plane origin (i.e. their real and complex component is zero in the continuous time case). Oscillations are present when poles with real part equal to zero have an imaginary part not equal to zero.|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} the RSA public <b>modulus</b> N as <b>a</b> {{composite}} {{of at least two}} secret large primes was always considered as a major obstacle facing the RSA function sharing without the help of a trusted dealer. The incorporated parties must agree on <b>a</b> suitable RSA <b>modulus</b> with no information revealed to them about its prime factors. Enormous number of trials must be performed before <b>a</b> suitable <b>modulus</b> is established. According to the number theory, for two ell-bit primes modulus, the number of trials is in the order of cal{O}(ell^ 2). Efforts have been made to reduce the quadratic slowdown in the generation process, however, most of these protocols allow the joint generation of <b>a</b> multi-prime RSA <b>modulus</b> (<b>an</b> RSA <b>modulus</b> with at least three prime factors), which is a drift from standard. Other protocols require distributed primality tests over <b>a</b> shared secret <b>modulus</b> which is <b>an</b> extensive task. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet an efficient idea to allow two parties to jointly generate <b>a</b> two-prime RSA <b>modulus</b> with <b>a</b> running time complexity cal{O}(ell). In our protocol, the distributed primality test is performed over <b>a</b> public <b>modulus.</b> Consequently, the expected running time will be reduced from several days to only few minutes.

2500|$|Clearly, any {{sequence}} with <b>a</b> <b>modulus</b> of Cauchy convergence is a Cauchy sequence. The converse (that every Cauchy sequence has <b>a</b> <b>modulus)</b> {{follows from}} the well-ordering property of the natural numbers (let [...] be the smallest possible [...] {{in the definition of}} Cauchy sequence, taking [...] to be [...] ). However, this well-ordering property does not hold in constructive mathematics (it is equivalent to the principle of excluded middle). On the other hand, this converse also follows (directly) from the principle of dependent choice (in fact, it will follow from the weaker AC00), which is generally accepted by constructive mathematicians. Thus, moduli of Cauchy convergence are needed directly only by constructive mathematicians who (like Fred Richman) do not wish to use any form of choice.|$|E
