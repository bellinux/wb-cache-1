This system was utilized to direct one-quarter of all strike missions conducted by U.S. aircraft during the conflict. Combat Skyspot was complemented by expanding the radio-based LORAN system utilized by other strike aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the Smithsonian Institution {{commissioned}} {{aeronautical engineer}} Paul MacCready {{to build a}} half-scale working model of Quetzalcoatlus northropi. The replica was launched with <b>a</b> <b>ground-based</b> winch. It flew several times in 1986 and was filmed {{as part of the}} Smithsonian's IMAX film On the Wing. However, the model was not anatomically correct and embodied vertical and horizontal tail stabilizers that pterosaurs did not have. It also had a longer tail, changing the weight distribution.|$|E

5|$|Clyde Fenton, {{known for}} his {{exploits}} as a flying doctor in the Northern Territory before being commissioned as a pilot in the RAAF, served as an instructor at No.3 EFTS from mid-1940 to early 1942. King was posted to command No.5 EFTS at Narromine, New South Wales, in December 1940. By this time No.3 EFTS was reported as having graduated 200 pilots in the eight flying training courses it had run since its formation. One of its graduates was Nicky Barr, who become a fighter ace in the North African Campaign with twelve victories to his credit. No.3 EFTS began operating <b>a</b> <b>ground-based</b> Link Trainer on 17February 1941. The school started flying the recently introduced CAC Wackett Trainer in August 1941, but the type proved troublesome, delaying the training program. From September to November 1941, a detachment of personnel from No.11 EFTS also utilised training facilities at Essendon, after their home aerodrome at Benalla had been inundated by heavy rain. No.3 EFTS's instructors, students and Wackett Trainers were transferred to No.11 EFTS during April 1942, and the Essendon school was disbanded on 1May.|$|E

25|$|In February 2007, the US started formal {{negotiations}} with Czech Republic and Poland concerning construction of missile shield installations {{in those countries}} for <b>a</b> <b>Ground-Based</b> Midcourse Defense System. Government of the Czech Republic agrees (while 67% Czechs disagree and only about 22% support it) to host a missile defense radar on its territory while a base of missile interceptors {{is supposed to be}} built in Poland. The objective is reportedly to protect another parts of US National Missile Defense from long-range missile strikes from Iran and North Korea, but Czech PM Mirek Topolánek said the main reason is to avoid Russian influence and strengthen ties to US.|$|E
25|$|Tom Laliberty of Raytheon {{said that}} President Barack Obama {{was forced to}} shift from a land based missile defense system to a sea based one because of the {{difficulties}} of coordinating with partner nations. There is discussion {{about the effectiveness of}} this plan. Some critics say it is not as effective as <b>a</b> <b>ground-based</b> defense since the most advanced Standard missiles lack even half the range to hit ICBMs and even IRBMs arcing overhead. Also, the U.S. Defense Department has said it would be just one component of a wider defense which might also include ground-based facilities. There are some reports that SPY-1 radar systems onboard some individual warships are not being maintained properly.|$|E

The combination of two satellites and <b>a</b> <b>ground-based</b> repeater network was designed to provide gap-free coverage anywhere within the contiguous U.S., the southern tip of Alaska, and {{in the southern part of}} Canada. The signal could also be received in the Caribbean Islands and most of Mexico (reports have stated that areas north of Acapulco were able to receive a steady signal), however XM is not yet licensed for reception by paid subscribers living in these areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{balloons}} are maneuvered {{by adjusting}} their altitude {{in the stratosphere}} to float to a wind layer after identifying the wind layer with the desired speed and direction using wind data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Users of the service connect to the balloon network using a special Internet antenna attached to their building. The signal travels through the balloon network from balloon to balloon, then to <b>a</b> <b>ground-based</b> station connected to an Internet service provider (ISP), then onto the global Internet. The system aims to bring Internet access to remote and rural areas poorly served by existing provisions, and to improve communication during natural disasters to affected regions. Key {{people involved in the}} project include Rich DeVaul, chief technical architect, who is also an expert on wearable technology; Mike Cassidy, a project leader; and Cyrus Behroozi, a networking and telecommunication lead.|$|E
25|$|In July 2015, the Irish {{government}} revealed {{plans to}} purchase <b>a</b> <b>ground-based</b> long-range air surveillance radar {{system for the}} Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) and Defence Forces {{to keep track of}} covert aircraft flying in Irish-controlled airspace, including military aircraft that do not file a flight plan and have their transponders switched off. Minister for Defence Simon Coveney said the increased capability would give better coverage of the Atlantic airspace over which the IAA has responsibility. The long-range surveillance radar is reported to cost €10 million, and is seen as a priority purchase to provide the civilian and military authorities with an improved competency in monitoring aerial incursions. Ireland is not a member of NATO, and thus does not benefit from integrated European military radar systems nor NATO equipment. The Irish Air Corps lacks a dedicated air intercept capability, and previous air incursions have seen the Royal Air Force respond to and escort unwelcome aircraft out of Irish controlled airspace.|$|E

25|$|Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) and jujutsu came to {{international}} {{prominence in the}} martial arts community in the early 1990s, when BJJ expert Royce Gracie won the first, second and fourth Ultimate Fighting Championships, {{which at the time}} were single-elimination martial arts tournaments. Royce often fought against much larger opponents who practiced other styles, including boxing, wrestling, shoot-fighting, karate and taekwondo. It has since become a staple art and key component for many MMA fighters. BJJ and jujutsu are largely credited for bringing widespread attention to the importance of ground fighting. BJJ is primarily <b>a</b> <b>ground-based</b> fighting style that emphasizes joint locks and chokeholds, whereas jujutsu is a method of close combat that utilizes different forms of grappling techniques such as throws, holds and joint locks. As jujutsu may also involve the use of a short weapon, it cannot be used to its full potential in mixed martial arts which prohibits the use of such weapons. Current fighters who are known for their BJJ skills include Joe Lauzon, Ronaldo Souza, Demian Maia, Fabrício Werdum and Rafael Dos Anjos.|$|E
