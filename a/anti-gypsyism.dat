40|$|A ghostbuster is roaming around Europe: <b>anti-gypsyism.</b> <b>Anti-gypsyism</b> fights against Gypsies, but {{in order}} to fight them, it had to invent them first. <b>Anti-gypsyism</b> is based on an {{apparent}} paradox: it is battling with a ghost, "Gypsies", something which it has concocted by itself. <b>Anti-gypsyism</b> {{is one of the many}} ghostbusters that clouds a large number of collective European or Euro-descendant minds. Like all kinds of ghost-hunting and hallucinations, it requires material, tangible, flesh-and-blood scapegoats. Depending on the time and place, <b>anti-gypsyism</b> scapegoats have been, or still are, people known as Rom, Sinti, Manuš, Calons, Travellers, Romaničel, etc. From the very first meeting with these peoples, antigypsyism has been an ever-expanding cloud. <b>Anti-gypsyism</b> fights against this cloud, and loses, just like Don Quixote against windmills. However, when fighting the cloud actually involves the flesh and blood of its scapegoats, then the Rom, Sinti, etc, pay dearly. Sometimes they succumb, sometimes they flee. Now and then they adapt and sometimes they become stronger than ever. The earthly existence of many Rom, Sinti, etc. depends on self-defence and every day they are obliged to use their intelligence to contain the <b>anti-gypsyism</b> that pursues them. They have to invest both individual and collective energy which could be used much more beneficially. In fact, whenever <b>anti-gypsyism</b> allows them a truce, creativity blossoms in many and others find a serenity that finally turns them into ordinary citizens. This paper simply aims at shedding a little conceptual light. Since <b>anti-gypsyism</b> is a complex phenomenon with a varied history that has only been the object of recent study and comprehension, making a start by trying to explain the terms we use could perhaps be useful in putting a stop to it...|$|E
40|$|The Council of Europe {{definition}} of <b>anti-Gypsyism</b> {{focuses on the}} role of stereotypes and violent practices in the exclusion of the Roma. Research has shown that authorities have a tendency to embrace anti-Gypsyist attitudes and to implement overtly securitising policies that further entrench the exclusion of the Roma. Research has also shown that, besides established stereotypes, new ones are emerging. Drawing on our experience as observing participants in {{the development and implementation of}} Manchester City Council’s Roma Strategy, we will show how the strategy was aimed to prevent violent <b>anti-Gypsyism,</b> but how stereotypes nonetheless infiltrated its implementation and, finally, how the mobilisation of the Roma successfully challenged these stereotypes. The paper argues that current definitions of <b>anti-Gypsyism</b> are unable to capture instances of essentialist and pathologising discourses that inform interventions aiming at Roma inclusion but which may in fact perpetuate their marginalisation. The paper therefore challenges the notion that stereotypes only inform exclusionary or securitising interventions. The paper will show how academic research can be mobilised to dismiss stereotypes and to inspire the Roma to take action and challenge benevolent but nonetheless stereotyping interventions...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} ‘anti-Gypsyism’ aims to refocus public {{policies}} addressing Roma discrimination {{in order to}} place responsibility for combating structural, historically-embedded and systemic forms of racism, discrimination and exclusion towards Roma squarely on state institutions and actors. This report examines {{the ways in which}} policies and funding combat ‘anti-Gypsyism’ in the European Union and selected Member States and assesses the added value of the ‘anti-Gypsyism’ concept, with particular reference to its institutional forms. It explores ways in which these institutional forms could be combated by identifying some ‘promising practices or experiences’ found in five selected EU Member States (Germany, Romania, Spain, Sweden and the UK). These ‘promising practices’ include reactive and proactive measures organised around four main themes: i) national, regional and local institutional responses; ii) training and education activities; iii) access to justice and effective remedies; and iv) media, public attitudes and political discourse. The report further draws conclusions and provides a set of policy recommendations for EU and national policy-makers to effectively combat <b>anti-Gypsyism.</b> The authors highlight that discussions on antiGypsyism should focus not only on its definition, but on the actual outputs of current national and EU policies and a more robust application of EU rule of law and fundamental rights monitoring and reporting mechanisms. A key proposal put forward is to expand the scope of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies to become the EU Framework for National Roma Inclusion and Combating <b>Anti-Gypsyism</b> and to equip it with the necessary authority and means to tackle systematic and institutional manifestations of <b>anti-Gypsyism...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} the {{contemporary}} phenomenon of <b>Anti-Gypsyism</b> which diffused widely throughout social representations of the so called “Gypsies”. In Europe and especially in Italy, the media tends to reproduce racist stereotypes and prejudices through a xenophobic depiction of this ethnic group, often offering an ethnocentric point of view. From an anthropological perspective, Roma people are a minority group facing diasporic phenomena across Europe, produced by the host societies...|$|E
40|$|Hundreds of Roma {{have been}} murdered in hate crime attacks {{in recent years in}} several European states. Even though <b>anti-gypsyism</b> has many common characteristics, its {{expression}} can differ in different countries. Despite the Nordic countries having recently become a “migration hot spot”, when it comes to Roma, very few studies of hate crimes against Roma have been conducted in Scandinavia. This article, which is mostly based on in-depth interviews, is therefore an important contribution to the research field of hate crimes against Roma. The purpose of the article is to examine and exploit Roma experiences of everyday harassment, discrimination and hate crime and to discuss the usefulness of the hate crime concept in the work to combat <b>anti-gypsyism.</b> The interviewed Roma´s narratives clearly show that prejudices against and the discrimination of Roma are {{part and parcel of the}} everyday and influence their lives in many respects. Some of the interviews show that as a Traveller/Roma you are exposed to physical violence and death threats. Despite this many of the victims do not report such incidents. Thi...|$|E

40|$|The article {{develops}} a critical, applied and interdisciplinary perspective, to contrast <b>anti-Gypsyism.</b>   The {{research has been}} carried out within the “National Project for Inclusion and Integration of Roma children, Sinti and Caminanti”, realized during 2013 / 14 in the city of Milan.  The theoretical frame refers to different dimensions, respectively represented by the paradigm of contrast of <b>anti-Gypsyism,</b> the researches focused on educational policies towards Roma children and the inclusive education theory.  Within this framework, the article analyses the assumptions on which the whole intervention was based and will provide an ethnographic account of the training activities carried out with the contribution of the authors in two schools in Milan. Based on these data, the article highlights the elements of continuity and discontinuity in educational policy toward Roma children and their families implemented in the city in the last years. The article analyses eventually the results of the training that was carried out, highlighting the effects produced by the interaction between research and reality. The analysis aims at revealing that anti-Gypsysm is, paradoxically, necessary for the emergence of the opposite paradigm (“contrasting anti-Gypsyism”), within which discourses are produced, funds are allocated, and the projects and careers of “opponents to anti-Gypsyism” are advanced...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} project presented here emerges from my long-term {{interest in the}} meaning of security in relation to socially excluded localities. These places have become a hot spot in the Czech Republic, as their partly Romany populations are accused of the higher rates of criminality on the municipal level. To understand this recent wave of <b>anti-Gypsyism,</b> I offer a proposal of a {{research project}} based on securitization theory. There are suggested four dimensions that allow the process of saying and doing security to originate, that is, material, symbolic, territorial, and political-bureaucratic dimension. Last but not least, the possibilities to incorporate the findings from my ethnographic research in an excluded locality into the whole enterprise are outlined {{as well as several}} problems involved in this regard...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} divided into three parts. The first {{concerns}} the concept of Anti-Gypsyism; the second, the stereotypes and the research conducted by the author on the alleged kidnapping by Roma; concludes with a discussion about the link between <b>Anti-Gypsyism,</b> power and urban space. <b>Anti-Gypsyism</b> is a distinct type of racist ideology. It is, at the same time, similar, different, and intertwined with many other types of racism. Anti- Gypsyism is used to justify and perpetrate the exclusion and supposed inferiority of Roma and is based on historical persecution and negative stereotypes (see also V. Nicolae 2006). According to Herzfeld (1997) stereotypes can be used for trade or in situations of conflict in which questions of identity are played out. Individuals and social groups appropriate these collective imaginations and use them to reify their sense of collective self. The analysis of cases of alleged kidnapping clearly shows the “baby-stealing Gypsies” stereotype in action and exemplar in action and how it produces effects of reality. Drawing on an ethnographic study on the cases of alleged kidnapping of non-Romani children by Roma and Sinti adults in Italy, the research demonstrates how negative stereotyping which construct the Roma as dangerous nomadic people, foreigners from whom society must be protected, can affect their treatment by prosecutors, lawyers and judges in the Italian judicial system. The conflation of Romani identity with nomadic lifestyle features widely in Italian public discourse on the Roma and, as it has been validly pointed out in scholarly debate (Piasere 1991; Brunello 1996; Sigona 2002), has gone some way towards building differential treatment towards Romani groups in particular in relation to housing policies and the spread of ‘nomad camps’ (Sigona 2005) ...|$|E

For centuries Roma have been blamed and feared; their social identities constructed to fulfil a function to be the visible ‘other’. The Brexit debate offered fertile, but well-trodden, ground for negative discourse. Whilst the impact of the debate was perceived as hostile by GTR, there was a further effect of GTR embodying three key gripping anti-EU arguments: sovereignty of policy making, immigration control and potential cost savings of withdrawing from the EU. The research shows the felt hostility by GTR and suggests that the successful performance of the social construction of Roma in the debate was vital to the hegemonic, anti-EU, fear and blame discourse of Brexit...|$|E

40|$|This book {{considers}} {{the issue of}} free speech in transitional democracies focusing on the socio-legal developments in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. In showing how these Central and Eastern European countries have engaged with free speech models imported from the Council of Europe / EU and the USA, the book offers valuable insights into the ways States have responded to challenges associated with transformation from communism to Western democracy. The book first explores freedom of expression in European and American law looking particularly at hate speech, historical revisionism, and pornography. It subsequently enquires into the role and perspectives of those European (mandatory) and US-American (persuasive) models for the constitutional debate in Central and Eastern Europe. The study offers an original interpretation of the "European" model of freedom of expression, beyond the mechanisms of the Council of Europe. It encompasses the relevant aspects of EU law (judgments of the Court of Justice and the harmonised EU instruments) as mandatory standards for courts and legislators, including those in transitional countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The book argues for de-criminalisation of historical revisionism and pornography, and illuminates topics such as genocide denial, the rise of Prague and Budapest as Europe’s porno-capitals, anti-Semitism and <b>anti-Gypsyism,</b> religious obscurantism and homophobia, virulent Islamophobia, and the glorification of terrorism. The research methodology in this study combines a descriptive case law assessment (comparative constitutional, public international, and EU law) with a normative critique stemming from post-structuralist scrutiny, rhetoric, postmodern legal movements, legal history, history of ideas, and art criticism.

40|$|Dichiarazione dello stato di emergenza in relazione agli insediamenti di comunità nomadi nel territorio delle regioni Campania, Lazio e Lombardia”, “Strategia Nazionale di inclusione dei Rom, dei Sinti e dei Caminanti 2012 - 2020 ”, “Progetto Rom, Sinti e Caminanti” (Municipality of Milan), are {{examples}} of Italian national or local policies or practices that create and reproduce specific categories in which a multitude of persons, stories, origins, situations are subsumed, according to a supposed ethno-cultural similarity. Based on a categorical approach and on a deep-rooted <b>anti-gypsyism,</b> these policies could risk homogenizing, essentializing and making “gypsy” the identity of different people, separating them {{from the rest of}} the population. The paper deals with men and women, Romanian citizens, in majority Roma, migrated to Italy during the last ten-twelve years and mainly settled in makeshift camps on the northern outskirts of Milan. Immediately categorized as Roma or as Nomads, they are identified as a “social problem”, “marginal subjects”, needing the implementation of particular “integration” policies. It seems that to categorize these people as Roma or as Nomads could allow to avoid to wonder about political, economical and social causes of the existence of unauthorized settlements, and could allow not to consider these families’ mobility within the broader migratory movements from Romania. Considering the experiences of the last four years of ethnographic research and the first results of the European Research Project MigRom - The immigration of Romanian Roma to Western Europe: causes, effects and future engagement strategies, especially the attempt to map the presences of Romanian Roma in Italy, the paper aims to show flexible subjectivities, multiple and variable belongings, and people able to resist, through everyday life practices, to strict categorizations and to the violence produced by them. On one hand there are policies of “inclusion” that risk to create and exacerbate conflicts and discrimination, but on the other hand there are people able to resist moving inside these networks of power and among their different identities, in Italy and in Romania, in relation with gagé or with other Roma, bringing into question the so-called “Roma question” which has acquired new strength and an even greater weight at a political and media level, particularly since the arrival of Romanian migrants...|$|E
