5|$|After the {{processed}} antigen (peptide) is complexed to the MHC molecule, {{they both}} migrate together {{to the cell}} membrane, where they are exhibited (elaborated) as a complex that can be recognized by the CD 4+ (T helper cell)– a type of white blood cell. This is known as <b>antigen</b> <b>presentation.</b> However, the epitopes (conformational epitopes) that are recognized by the B cell prior to their digestion {{may not be the}} same as that presented to the T helper cell.

The DCA is described in detail, and its use as an anomaly detector is illustrated {{within the context of}} computer security. A port scan detection task is performed to substantiate the influence of signal selection on the behaviour of the algorithm.

Many mechanisms {{have been involved in}} the tumour escape from host immune surveillance. The tumour microenvironment has emerged as an important component contributing to dendritic cells (DCs) dysfunction.

5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{discovery}} of post-translational circular permutations and {{the suggestion of}} a possible genetic mechanism for evolving circular permutants, it was not until 1995 that the first circularly permuted pair of genes were discovered. Saposins are a class of proteins involved in sphingolipid catabolism and <b>antigen</b> <b>presentation</b> of lipids in humans. Chris Ponting and Robert Russell identified a circularly permuted version of a saposin inserted into plant aspartic proteinase, which they nicknamed swaposin. Saposin and swaposin were the first known case of two natural genes related by a circular permutation.|$|E
5|$|A second defence of {{vertebrates}} against viruses {{is called}} cell-mediated immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and, if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed by killer T cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells {{such as the}} macrophage are specialists at this <b>antigen</b> <b>presentation.</b> The production of interferon is an important host defence mechanism. This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present. Its role in immunity is complex; it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} for unfolding of globular proteins is necessarily general, but somewhat {{dependent on the}} amino acid sequence. Long sequences of alternating glycine and alanine {{have been shown to}} inhibit substrate unfolding, decreasing the efficiency of proteasomal degradation; this results in the release of partially degraded byproducts, possibly due to the decoupling of the ATP hydrolysis and unfolding steps. Such glycine-alanine repeats are also found in nature, for example in silk fibroin; in particular, certain Epstein–Barr virus gene products bearing this sequence can stall the proteasome, helping the virus propagate by preventing <b>antigen</b> <b>presentation</b> on the major histocompatibility complex.|$|E
40|$|The {{immune system}} can be thought as a complex network of {{different}} interacting elements. A cellular automaton, defined in shape-space, was recently shown to exhibit self-regulation and complex behavior and is, therefore, a good candidate to model the immune system. Using this model to simulate a real immune system we find good agreement with recent experiments on mice. The model exhibits the experimentally observed refractory behavior {{of the immune system}} under multiple <b>antigen</b> <b>presentations</b> as well as loss of its plasticity caused by aging.

40|$|Background: MHC-II {{restricted}} CD 4 + T {{cells are}} dependent on antigen presenting cells (APC) for their activation. APC dysfunction in HIV-infected individuals could accelerate or exacerbate CD 4 + T cell dysfunction and may contribute to increased levels of immunodeficiency seen in some patients regardless of their CD 4 + T cell numbers. Here we test the hypothesis that APC from HIV-infected individuals have diminished <b>antigen</b> processing and <b>presentation</b> capacity. Methodology/Principal Findings: Monocytes (MN) were purified by immuno-magnetic bead isolation techniques from HLA-DR 1. 01 + or DR 15. 01 + HIV-infected and uninfected individuals.

In West Africa an HLA class I antigen (HLA Bw53) and an HLA class II haplotype (DRB1*13OZ-DQB1*0501) are independently associated with protection against severe malaria.

The immunogenicity of host proteins naturally incorporated in retrovirus was hypothesized to impact the performance of retrovirus based vaccines. In this work, the capacity of engineered retrovirus like particles devoided of host protein CD 81 to display HCV envelope antigens was compared to non-engineered particles. A persistent inability of CD 81 negative VLPs to incorporate HCV E 2 protein as a result from the inefficient transport of HCV E 2 to the plasma membrane, was observed. This work enabled the identification of a CD 81 -mediated transport of HCV E 2 while stressing the importance of host proteins for the development of recombinant vaccines.|$|R

25|$|MHC {{molecules}} enable {{immune system}} surveillance {{of the population}} of protein molecules in a host cell, and greater MHC diversity permits greater diversity of <b>antigen</b> <b>presentation.</b> In 1976, Yamazaki et al demonstrated a sexual selection mate choice by male mice for females of a different MHC.

25|$|Diversity of <b>antigen</b> <b>presentation,</b> {{mediated}} by MHC classes I and II, is attained {{in at least}} three ways: (1) an organism's MHC repertoire is polygenic (via multiple, interacting genes); (2) MHC expression is codominant (from both sets of inherited alleles); (3) MHC gene variants are highly polymorphic (diversely varying from organism to organism within a species). Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection has been observed in male mice making mate choices of females with different MHCs and thus demonstrating sexual selection. Also, at least for MHC I presentation, there has been evidence of antigenic peptide splicing which can combine peptides from different proteins, vastly increasing antigen diversity.|$|E

40|$|Heat shock {{proteins}} (HSPs) are molecular chaperones {{that bind}} tumor antigens and mediate their uptake into antigen presenting cells. HSP–antigen complexes are then directed toward either the MHC class I pathway through <b>antigen</b> cross <b>presentation</b> or the conventional class II pathway, leading to activation of T cell subsets. Uptake of HSP-chaperoned polypeptides can involve both receptor-mediated and receptor-independent routes, and mechanisms of antigen sorting between the Class I and II pathways after uptake are currently under investigation. The {{processes involved in}} internalization of HSP–antigen complexes differ somewhat from the mechanisms previously determined for (unchaperoned) particulate and free soluble antigens. A number of studies show that HSP-facilitated <b>antigen</b> cross <b>presentation</b> requires uptake of the complexes by scavenger receptors (SR) followed by processing in the proteasome, and loading onto MHC class I molecules.

25|$|HSV evades {{the immune}} system through {{interference}} with MHC class I <b>antigen</b> <b>presentation</b> on the cell surface, by blocking TAP or the transporter associated with antigen processing induced by the secretion of ICP-47 by HSV. In the host cell, TAP transports digested viral antigen epitope peptides from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum, allowing these epitopes to be combined with MHC class I molecules and presented {{on the surface of}} the cell. Viral epitope presentation with MHC class I is a requirement for activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), the major effectors of the cell-mediated immune response against virally-infected cells. ICP-47 prevents initiation of a CTL-response against HSV, allowing the virus to survive for a protracted period in the host.|$|E
25|$|For example, it {{was useful}} {{to examine the}} {{functional}} relationship between TAP peptide transport and HLA class I <b>antigen</b> <b>presentation.</b> TAP is a transmembrane protein responsible for the transport of antigenic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum, where MHC them class I molecules can bind them and presented to T cells. As TAP does not bind all peptides equally, TAP-binding affinity could influence {{the ability of a}} particular peptide {{to gain access to the}} MHC class I pathway. Artificial neural network (ANN), a computer model was used to study peptide binding to human TAP and its relationship with MHC class I binding. The affinity of HLA-binding peptides for TAP was found to differ according to the HLA supertype concerned using this method. This research could have important implications for the design of peptide based immuno-therapeutic drugs and vaccines. It shows the power of the modeling approach to understand complex immune interactions.|$|E
25|$|T cells (thymus cells) and B cells (bone marrow- or bursa-derived cells) are {{the major}} {{cellular}} components of the adaptive immune response. T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, whereas B cells are primarily responsible for humoral immunity (relating to antibodies). The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize specific “non-self” antigens, during {{a process known as}} <b>antigen</b> <b>presentation.</b> Once they have identified an invader, the cells generate specific responses that are tailored to maximally eliminate specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells. B cells respond to pathogens by producing large quantities of antibodies which then neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. In response to pathogens some T cells, called T helper cells, produce cytokines that direct the immune response, while other T cells, called cytotoxic T cells, produce toxic granules that contain powerful enzymes which induce the death of pathogen-infected cells. Following activation, B cells and T cells leave a lasting legacy of the antigens they have encountered, in the form of memory cells. Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells will remember each specific pathogen encountered, and are able to mount a strong and rapid response if the same pathogen is detected again; this is known as acquired immunity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Activation of naïve B {{lymphocytes}} by extracellular ligands, e. g. antigen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CD 40 ligand, induces {{a combination}} of common and ligand-specific phenotypic changes through complex signal transduction pathways. For example, although {{all three of these}} ligands induce proliferation, only stimulation through the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) induces apoptosis in resting splenic B cells. In order to define the common and unique biological responses to ligand stimulation, we compared the gene expression changes induced in normal primary B cells by a panel of ligands using cDNA microarrays and a statistical approach, CLASSIFI (Cl uster Assi gnment f or Biological I nference), which identifies significant co-clustering of genes with similar Gene Ontology™ annotation. Results CLASSIFI analysis revealed an overrepresentation of genes involved in ion and vesicle transport, including multiple components of the proton pump, in the BCR-specific gene cluster, suggesting that activation of <b>antigen</b> processing and <b>presentation</b> pathways is a major biological response to antigen receptor stimulation. Proton pump components that {{were not included in the}} initial microarray data set were also upregulated in response to BCR stimulation in follow up experiments. MHC Class II expression was found to be maintained specifically in response to BCR stimulation. Furthermore, ligand-specific internalization of the BCR, a first step in B cell <b>antigen</b> processing and <b>presentation,</b> was demonstrated. Conclusion These observations provide experimental validation of the computational approach implemented in CLASSIFI, demonstrating that CLASSIFI-based gene expression cluster analysis is an effective data mining tool to identify biological processes that correlate with the experimental conditional variables.
