5|$|The {{complaint}} to Turkey had a desired effect locally, with an apology from the country's government and <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> breaking diplomatic ties to Germany if required. However, {{it failed to}} elicit a response from Germany. The Allies' request to the Spanish government was relayed to the Germans, but identified almost immediately as deception and misdirection.|$|E

5|$|As {{they travel}} together, Natalie {{questions}} Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly on relationships and love, but Ryan is adamant {{that he is}} more than happy with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message, and Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal to consider <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> Alex {{in spite of their}} obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterward they are both ordered back to Omaha to implement Natalie's program. On the test run, the earlier concerns Ryan raised prove valid; one laid-off person breaks down in tears before the camera, and Natalie is unable to comfort him.|$|E

5|$|Blamey was {{involved}} in discussions with the government over {{the size of the}} Army to be maintained. Now that the danger of invasion of Australia had passed, the government reconsidered how the nation's resources, particularly of manpower, should be distributed. Blamey pressed for <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> maintain three AIF divisions, as only they could legally be sent north of the equator where the final campaigns would be fought. He urged that the Empire Air Training Scheme be curtailed, and opposed MacArthur's proposal to use the Australian Army primarily for logistic support and leave combat roles principally to American troops.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{this loss}} of sponsorship, Davies {{completed}} his studies and graduated in 1913. His plans to enter the ministry were abandoned; he was {{an active member of}} the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and his religious vocation had been replaced by <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> working-class politics. In 1913, while still a student, he stood for election to Cardiff's Board of Guardians, as the ILP candidate in the Grangetown ward. This first foray into electoral politics ended in a narrow defeat, by 47 votes.|$|E

Geological disposal has been studied since 1985, and a permanent deep geological repository was required by law in 2003.

5|$|Lassie themes {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} boys and their dogs with the show helping to shape the viewer's understanding of mid-twentieth century American boyhood. Lassie {{was associated with the}} wholesome family values of its period but some parents' groups monitoring television content found cliffhanger plots showing children in danger too intense for very young viewers and objected to some of Timmy's actions which were believed to encourage children to disobey parents. However, Lassie was consistently depicted as caring, nurturing, and responsible with <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> family and community, often rescuing those in peril and righting wrongs. She was the perfect 'mother' within the American ideology of the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Mark Wahlberg as Captain Leo DavidsonA United States Air Force {{astronaut}} who accidentally opens {{a portal}} to another world inhabited by talking human-like apes and is captured by them. Leo leads a rebellion of the planet's humans. Wahlberg had {{backed out of}} <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> Ocean's Eleven to take this role in Planet of the Apes. (Matt Damon was eventually cast in the Ocean's Eleven role.) Whereas other actors contending for the Leo Davidson role {{wanted to see the}} script before signing a contract, Wahlberg signed on after a five-minute meeting with Burton. To avoid evoking associations with his previous work as an underwear model, Wahlberg did not wear a loincloth, even though Heston had worn one in the original film.|$|E

As part of Service to America, the BSA provided service projects in conjunction with the National Park Service (NPS).

5|$|Several travel guides have praised {{individual}} {{parts of}} the road, such as the section from Tyndrum to Glencoe across Rannoch Moor, as providing memorable driving experiences. Tourists find the A82 a popular route because of its scenery, and {{it serves as a}} main artery for commercial and heavy goods traffic. Transport Scotland have publicly declared <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> improve congestion and safety along the road. Parts of the A82 are occasionally closed for maintenance, which has resulted in strong protest from the local community, and the road has been criticised for its poor accident record.|$|E
5|$|The 2016–17 budget {{forecasts}} that defence expenditure will increase to $39.3 billion in 2019–20, which {{is estimated to}} represent 1.97% of GDP.

The 2016 Defence White Paper included <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> further increases in spending beyond this time, with nominal expenditure being projected to be around $58.8 billion in 2020–25; the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has estimated that this would represent about 2.16% of GDP.|$|E

Miliband's conference speech was criticised, particularly after he missed sections on the deficit and immigration, after attempting to deliver the speech without notes. At the conference, Miliband pledged to focus on six national goals for Britain until 2025, including boosting pay, apprenticeships and housing; a mansion tax and levy on tobacco companies to fund £2.5 billion a year 'time to care' fund for the NHS; <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> {{raise the minimum wage}} to £8 or more by 2020; and a promise to lower the voting age to 16 ready for elections in 2016.|$|E

Progress towards these goals, which were to be met by 2015, was ultimately uneven. The 2005 World Summit reaffirmed the UN's focus on promoting development, peacekeeping, human rights, and global security. The Sustainable Development Goals were launched in 2015 to succeed the Millennium Development Goals.|$|E

Port Charlotte's NJROTC program was established in the early 1990s; since then, it has grown significantly. The company of cadets are overseen and instructed by two retired United States Navy personnel, who are in turn overseen by the United States Navy itself through the form of Area Managers. Port Charlotte's unit is a member of NJROTC Area Seven, and is known for service to its community.|$|E
