[...] There's a grounded feel to player characters that make you another cog in the machine with the abilities and limitations of an ordinary soldier, not a supernatural saviour." [...] He praised the game's graphical enhancements, saying [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered looks and sounds like a fresh game on par with today's graphical and aural standards" [...] and calling it a [...] "ridiculously faithful remake", but wrote that the game still showed some slight signs of age, such as artificial intelligence problems and pacing issues. In short, he commended Raven Software [...] "for arguably delivering the most substantial, masterful remake we have ever experienced", and that [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered celebrates this legacy with updated visuals and sound that really go {{above and beyond the}} call of duty, sprucing up an old care package for a more modern age to near-perfection." ...|$|E

2500|$|Between 3 and 4 {{o'clock in}} the {{afternoon}} of the said 29th, it began to rain mud and ashes at Caysasay ( [...] from the volcano) and this rain lasted three days. The most terrifying circumstance was that the whole sky was shrouded in such darkness that we could not have seen the hand placed before the face, {{had it not been for}} the sinister glare of incessant lightnings. Nor could we use artificial light as this was extinguished by the wind and copious ashes which penetrated everywhere. All was horror those three days, which appeared rather like murky nights and we did not occupy ourselves with anything but see to it that the natives swept off the roofs the large quantities of ashes and stones which kept on accumulating upon them and threatened to bring them down upon us, burying us alive beneath their weight. But fearing that even these precautions might prove unavailing, we 3 Europeans – viz. Fr. Prior, the Alcalde, and myself – the only ones who were at the time in the Convento of Caysasay, took refuge on the landing of the stairs; as the safest place, and awaited there whatever God might dispose with regard to us. To all this was added incessant thunder and lightning, and it really looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> was going to pieces and its axis had been displaced.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{it to be}} land-telegraphs to-day, or {{submarine}} cables?" [...] inquired Madge, with as much {{gravity and}} earnestness <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world's</b> welfare depended on the decision.|$|R
50|$|The rule of marteloio has sailors plot routes {{by drawing}} plane triangles on a chart, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world's</b> surface were flat. While {{this might be}} {{practical}} enough for sailing confined to the compact latitudes of the Mediterranean Sea, it is quite misleading on a grander scale.|$|R
60|$|Foster groaned at this intimation, {{but made}} no remonstrance. The old woman assured Varney that Alasco had scarce eaten or drunken since her master's departure, living perpetually shut {{up in the}} laboratory, and talking <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world's</b> {{continuance}} depended on {{what he was doing}} there.|$|R
2500|$|The {{point of}} land on which Fort Caroline was {{situated}} is separated from the seacoast by an extensive swamp through which flows Pablo Creek, which rises {{a few miles from}} the head of North River. It was necessary for the Spaniards to go around this, for all of the creeks and rivers were full and the lowlands flooded owing to the continued rains. At no time was the water lower than up to their knees. No boats were taken along, so the soldiers swam the various creeks and streams, Menéndez taking the lead with a pike in his hand at the very first one they encountered. Those who could not swim were carried across on the pikes. It was extremely fatiguing work, for [...] "the rains continued as constant and heavy <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> was again to be overwhelmed with a flood." [...] Their clothes became soaked and heavy with water, their food as well, the powder wet, and the cords of the arquebuses worthless, and some of the men began to grumble, but Menéndez pretended not to hear. The vanguard selected the place for the night encampment, but it was difficult to find high ground on account of the flood. During their halts fires were built, but when within a day's march of Fort Caroline, even this was forbidden, for fear it would betray their approach to the enemy.|$|E
60|$|And {{they went}} on to talk {{newspaper}} just <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> was where it had always been.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never got}} tired {{of looking at the}} big wells when they lit them up," [...] said Christine. [...] "It seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> was on fire." ...|$|E

60|$|People talked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>World's</b> Fair was to {{make all}} nations friends; {{but it is not}} showing off their laces and their silks, their {{ironwork}} and brass, their pictures and statues, that can keep them at peace; and, only two years after the Great Exhibition, a great war broke out in Europe--only a year after the great Duke of Wellington had died, full of years and honors.|$|R
6000|$|... 38. 'So {{years had}} passed, when sudden {{earthquake}} rent The depth of ocean, and the cavern cracked With sound, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world's</b> wide continent [...] 3165 Had fallen in universal ruin wracked: And through the cleft streamed in one cataract The stifling waters--when I woke, the flood Whose banded waves that crystal cave had sacked Was ebbing round me, and my bright abode [...] 3170 Before me yawned--a chasm desert, and bare, and broad.|$|R
60|$|We sat silent after that; out {{of doors}} the light began to stir among the leaves. There were all kinds of {{rustling}} sounds, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> were turning over in bed.|$|E
6000|$|At {{these last}} words Herr Paul gave a start of real disgust. [...] "Hum!" [...] he muttered; it was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> were bent on being brutal to him. Mrs. Decie continued: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whereat Cousin Sophia put her {{handkerchief}} to {{her eyes}} pathetically <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> were indeed in terrible straits. As for Susan, Cousin Sophia was the salvation of her. She came to life with a jerk.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's a bargain! I {{do think}} {{people ought to}} see their own country before they go scooting off to foreign parts, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> new <b>world</b> wasn't worth discovering,' began Dan, ready to bury the hatchet.|$|R
60|$|And, {{even as he}} {{clung to}} his man, breathless, bruised, feeling <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all <b>the</b> <b>world</b> had {{dissolved}} in one vast explosion of dynamite, the door opened, banged to, and feet fled down the passage.|$|R
60|$|On that impenetrable background, obliterating {{the lofty}} {{mountains}} by the seaboard, {{she saw the}} slave of the San Tome silver, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> by an extraordinary power of a miracle. She accepted his return <b>as</b> <b>if</b> henceforth <b>the</b> <b>world</b> could hold no surprise for all eternity.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've asked Elbert Harvey and Mr. Mason also; I didn't {{want you}} to think I had no friends but doctors. It must seem to you <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is made up of doctors. But it isn't." ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{went back}} to the house the rain was {{beginning}} to fall; but there was no wind or sound in the air--only that dismal stillness, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> were holding its breath in expectation of a calamity.|$|E
6000|$|Polly {{held on to}} {{the back}} of Tom's chair, for a minute, for the news took her breath away, and she felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> was coming to an end, [...] "failed" [...] was such a vaguely dreadful word to her.|$|E
60|$|It was Mr Anon. The pony was reined back {{on to its}} haunches; {{the cart}} stood still. And my {{stranger}} and I were incredulously gazing at one another <b>as</b> <b>if</b> across eternity, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all <b>the</b> <b>world</b> beside were a dream that asked no awakening.|$|R
6000|$|And what a scene it was! Despite {{all that}} had been done, the hall might be {{described}} as waist-deep in letters! The fever had not yet abated. It seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>world</b> had concentrated its literary produce into one mighty avalanche on St. Martin's-le-Grand! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if it hasn't so shown"--and Lord Theign stared <b>as</b> <b>if</b> mystified--"what in <b>the</b> <b>world's</b> <b>the</b> {{meaning of}} this preposterous racket?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I am {{glad you}} didn't! It seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> swam round with wonder and happiness,' {{and she held}} his hand as if to steady herself, {{starting}} however as Annaple opened the door saying, 'We've been sending telegrams with the good news.' ...|$|E
6000|$|SAVVY. I just wont, Nunk. I {{shall have}} a vote when I am thirty; and I ought to have it now. Why are these two ridiculous people {{to be allowed to}} come in and walk over us <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> existed only to play their silly {{parliamentary}} game? ...|$|E
60|$|She went hastening on, gladdened {{by having}} met the grimy, lean {{man with the}} ragged moustache. He gave her a {{pleasant}} warm feeling. He made her feel the richness of her own life. Skrebensky, somehow, had created a deadness round her, a sterility, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> were ashes.|$|E
60|$|Then {{women and}} {{children}} were aiding in the work, for it was to save their homes from destruction that they labored, and foremost among them ever was George, struggling against <b>the</b> fire-fiend, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> everything <b>the</b> <b>world</b> held dear to him was in danger of destruction.|$|R
5000|$|... "Ecosystem {{services}} are the suite of benefits that ecosystems provide to humanity." [...] The natural species, or biota, are the caretakers of all ecosystems.

60|$|To Mike {{it seemed}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{everything}} in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> was standing still and waiting. He could hear nothing {{but his own}} breathing.|$|R
60|$|Clara {{was in my}} father's arms, {{her head}} lay on his shoulder, her face was as still in its heavenly calmness <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and the world's looks knew it no more, and the only light that fell on it now, was light from the angel's eyes. She had fainted.|$|E
60|$|Then {{they were}} both silent. He was here, in England, for six months. They had a space of six months between them. He waited. The same iron rigidity, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> were made of steel, possessed her again. It was no use turning with flesh and blood to this {{arrangement}} of forged metal.|$|E
6000|$|The girl paled with {{memory of}} it. [...] "It was terrible! I went all day without eating, {{and for two}} nights we were all too excited to sleep. It seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> were coming to an end. Mother cried because they wouldn't let her go with them. She didn't know father was leading the other army." ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{often have}} two sweeter women grown {{together}} on one stem. What were {{the men of}} Redlintie about? The sisters never asked each other this question, but there were times when, apparently without cause, Miss Ailie hugged Miss Kitty vehemently, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> challenging <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> and perhaps Miss Kitty understood.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. It has a sameness--a monotony {{that would}} drive me mad. It looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>world</b> {{had gone to}} wheat. It makes me think--oppresses me. All this means that we live by wheat alone. These bare hills! They're too open to wind and sun and snow. They look like the toil of ages." ...|$|R
6000|$|What is {{this that}} we sail through? What palpable obscure? What smoke and reek, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> whole {{steaming}} <b>world</b> were revolving on its axis, as a spit? ...|$|R
