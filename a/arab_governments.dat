5|$|Fatah {{dedicated}} {{itself to}} the liberation of Palestine by an armed struggle carried out by Palestinians themselves. This differed from other Palestinian political and guerrilla organizations, most of which firmly believed in a united Arab response. Arafat's organization never embraced the ideologies of the major <b>Arab</b> <b>governments</b> of the time, in contrast to other Palestinian factions, which often became satellites of nations such as Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria and others.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{some circles}} within the US State Department viewed Arafat as an able diplomat and {{negotiator}} {{who could get}} support from many <b>Arab</b> <b>governments</b> at once. An example of that, we find in March 1973 that Arafat tried to arrange for a meeting between the President of Iraq and the Emir of Kuwait in order to resolve their disputes.|$|E
5|$|As the {{conflict}} raged, other <b>Arab</b> <b>governments</b> attempted {{to negotiate a}} peaceful resolution. As part of this effort, Gamal Abdel Nasser led the first emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on 21 September. Arafat's speech drew sympathy from attending Arab leaders. Other heads of state took sides against Hussein, among them Muammar Gaddafi, who mocked him and his schizophrenic father King Talal. A ceasefire was agreed upon between the two sides, but Nasser died of a massive heart attack hours after the summit, and {{the conflict}} resumed shortly afterward.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the ouster}} of Faisal's <b>Arab</b> <b>government</b> from Syria in 1920, the group {{transferred}} its headquarters to Aleppo and Deir ez-Zor to continue to seek {{the establishment of an}} <b>Arab</b> <b>government</b> for Iraq. However, Faisal's collapse had greatly weakened the group, and its activities ceased soon after.|$|R

5|$|In {{accordance}} with his ideology, Arafat generally {{refused to accept}} donations to his organization from major <b>Arab</b> <b>governments,</b> in order to act independently of them. He {{did not want to}} alienate them, and sought their undivided support by avoiding ideological alliances. However, to establish the groundwork for Fatah's future financial support, he enlisted contributions from the many wealthy Palestinians working in Kuwait and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf, such as Qatar (where he met Mahmoud Abbas in 1961). These businessmen and oil workers contributed generously to the Fatah organization. Arafat continued this process in other Arab countries, such as Libya and Syria.|$|E
5|$|Britain, {{with its}} {{commitment}} to South Arabia and its base in Aden, considered the Egyptian invasion a real threat. Recognition of the republic posed a problem to several treaties Britain had signed with the sheiks and sultans of the South Arabian Federation. Saudi Arabia urged the British to identify themselves with the royalists. On the other hand, there were some in the British Foreign Office who believed Britain could buy security for Aden by recognizing the republic. However, Britain eventually decided not to recognize. Iran, Turkey and most of western Europe also withheld recognition. The republic did receive the recognition of West Germany, Italy, Canada and Australia, {{as well as the}} remaining <b>Arab</b> <b>governments,</b> Ethiopia and the entire communist bloc.|$|E
5|$|On 28 September 1961, secessionist army units {{launched}} a coup in Damascus, declaring Syria's secession from the UAR. In response, pro-union army units in northern Syria revolted and pro-Nasser protests occurred in major Syrian cities. Nasser sent Egyptian special forces to Latakia {{to bolster his}} allies, but withdrew them two days later, citing a refusal to allow inter-Arab fighting. Addressing the UAR's breakup on 5 October, Nasser accepted personal responsibility and declared that Egypt would recognize an elected Syrian government. He privately blamed interference by hostile <b>Arab</b> <b>governments.</b> According to Heikal, Nasser suffered something resembling a nervous breakdown after {{the dissolution of the}} union; he began to smoke more heavily and his health began to deteriorate.|$|E
50|$|In the October 1947 Arab League {{conference in}} Aley, the Arab states {{rejected}} {{the option of}} establishing an interim Palestinian <b>Arab</b> <b>government</b> and the Lebanese prime minister Riad Al Solh in particular told Hajj Amin al-Husseini that if a Palestinian <b>Arab</b> <b>government</b> will be established, he couldn't be part of it. Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam wanted that the Arab League will manage the Arab struggle in Palestine.|$|R
5|$|With the <b>Arab</b> <b>government</b> in Damascus {{destroyed}} and Faisal exiled, Hananu's rebels sought {{to compensate for}} the consequent loss of aid from the <b>Arab</b> <b>government.</b> In the period following the Arab defeat, the rebels began appointing administrators in their territory who oversaw the institution of taxes to support the revolt, monthly salaries for the fighters and supply services for the iṣābā. They also sought military training by Turkish officers.|$|R

5|$|He {{returned}} to Egyptian television in 1998, hosting the current affairs and press review talk show Ra'is el-Tahrir ("Editor-in-Chief"). The program {{became one of}} the most popular and respected in Egypt. After apparent trouble with the state censors, Qandil moved the show to Dubai TV in 2004 under the name Qalam Rosas ("Pencil.") The new program was highly watched throughout the Arab world. He was forced to quit Dubai TV after criticizing <b>Arab</b> <b>governments</b> and subsequently hosted the show on the Libyan channel Al-Libia for two months before the Libyan government cancelled it. He {{returned to}} Egypt and wrote for the Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper and then Al-Shorouk, but his association with the latter ended as a result of a libel suit brought on by then-Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit in response to a column critical of Egyptian foreign policy written by Qandil in May 2010. The case was later dropped following the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.|$|E
5|$|The Six-Day {{war began}} when Israel {{launched}} {{air strikes against}} Egypt's air force on 5 June 1967. The war ended in an Arab defeat and Israel's occupation of several Arab territories, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Although Nasser and his Arab allies had been defeated, Arafat and Fatah could claim a victory, in {{that the majority of}} Palestinians, who had up to that time tended to align and sympathize with individual <b>Arab</b> <b>governments,</b> now began to agree that a 'Palestinian' solution to their dilemma was indispensable. Many primarily Palestinian political parties, including George Habash's Arab Nationalist Movement, Hajj Amin al-Husseini's Arab Higher Committee, the Islamic Liberation Front and several Syrian-backed groups, virtually crumbled after their sponsor governments' defeat. Barely a week after the defeat, Arafat crossed the Jordan River in disguise and entered the West Bank, where he set up recruitment centers in Hebron, the Jerusalem area and Nablus, and began attracting both fighters and financiers for his cause.|$|E
5|$|Quwatli {{opposed the}} {{proposed}} partition of the British Mandate of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, {{arguing that the}} plan, which would allocate 56% of Palestine to the Jewish state, violated {{the rights of the}} Palestinian Arab majority. The proposal passed the UN vote and Syria made war preparations soon afterward, including co-founding the Arab Liberation Army (ALA). Quwatli had proposed the creation of the ALA as a volunteer force to attract fighters from throughout the Arab world and {{to take the place of}} Arab regular armies. The ALA's establishment was sponsored by the Arab League following the UN partition vote and Fawzi al-Qawuqji, a Syrian commander who played leading roles in the Great Syrian Revolt and the 1936 revolt in Palestine, was appointed its commander. Quwatli did not believe the armies of Syria and the Arab world were ready to successfully confront Jewish forces and as war drew near in early 1948, he petitioned Abdel Rahman Azzam, head of the Arab League, to not enter Arab armies into Palestine. Instead, Quwatli offered to provide local Palestinian Arab fighters arms and funding. Azzam was not swayed and continued his effort of rallying <b>Arab</b> <b>governments</b> to dispatch their armies. On 15 May, after the establishment of Israel was announced, Quwatli ordered the Syrian Army to enter Palestine immediately.|$|E

He went {{as far north as}} Turkish-held Urfa to gather tribal allegiance for the <b>Arab</b> <b>government</b> and support for Damascus's annexation of the regions near British-held Iraq. He received the support of several tribal sheikhs, but none agreed to accompany him back to Damascus to demonstrate their allegiance to Faisal, and many favored their regions becoming part of Iraq.|$|R

25|$|The Deir Yassin story did {{not much}} sway {{international}} opinion. It did increase not only support but pressure on <b>Arab</b> <b>governments</b> to intervene, notably Abdullah of Jordan, {{who was now}} compelled to join the invasion of Palestine after Israel's declaration of independence on 14 May.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, the WJC {{conducted}} {{negotiations with}} a number of <b>Arab</b> <b>governments,</b> notably in North Africa, and pleaded with them to allow their Jewish populations to leave their native countries. With the advance of Arab nationalism, especially during the 1950s, these efforts were increasingly complicated. In 1954, a WJC delegation visited Morocco, then still under French colonial rule.|$|E
25|$|These {{facilities}} {{enhanced the}} strategic importance of Palestine and of Haifa {{in particular in}} Britain's control of the eastern Mediterranean. The threat to British control of the region posed by the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in October 1935 and the deteriorating situation in Europe {{toward the end of}} the 1930s probably made British policy makers more willing to make concessions to <b>Arab</b> <b>governments</b> on the Palestine issue following the furore over the recommendations of the Peel Commission.|$|E
50|$|Hashem {{was born}} in Nablus and educated in Istanbul. In 1915 he joined the army and then the <b>Arab</b> <b>government</b> in Damascus.

50|$|France gained {{full control}} of Syria in 1920 after {{defeated}} the <b>Arab</b> <b>government</b> of King Faisal I in July 1920. During this time, guerrilla groups and political activists and dignitaries opposed to French rule launched a revolt against the French, known as the Hananu Revolt after its main political leader, Ibrahim Hananu. Faisal's <b>Arab</b> <b>government</b> had been the main financial backer of the revolt, but after its fall, Hananu and the rebels turned to Turkish guerrillas also fighting the French in southwestern Anatolia, which borders the Aleppo region. Jamil Ibrahim Pasha became a main liaison between the Syrian rebels and the Turkish guerrillas, who were led by Mustafa Kemal. Jamil Ibrahim Pasha met with Mustafa Kemal {{in the late summer}} of 1920 to finalize plans for a Turkish-Syrian military campaign against French forces. The Hananu revolt dissipated by the summer of 1921.|$|R

25|$|By October 2006, the US administration, Israel, many <b>Arab</b> <b>governments,</b> {{and much}} of Fatah – {{including}} most of Abbas’ key advisors still held the view that if Hamas does not unambiguously accept the Quartet’s conditions, it should and can be forced out of power through early elections, its dismissal and appointment of an emergency government or a popular referendum seeking Palestinian agreement to the Quartet’s conditions. The plan was also put forward by US President Bush in his meeting with Abbas on 20 September 2006.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Jewish {{actions by}} <b>Arab</b> <b>governments</b> in the 1950s and 1960s, {{in the context}} of the {{founding}} of the State of Israel, led to the departure of large numbers of Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East. 25,000 Mizrahi Jews from Egypt left after the 1956 Suez Crisis, led to the overwhelming majority of Mizrahim leaving Arab countries. They became refugees. Most went to Israel. Many Moroccan and Algerian Jews went to France. Thousands of Lebanese, Syrian and Egyptian Jews emigrated to the United States and to Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Al Jazeera was not {{the first}} such {{broadcaster}} in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 <b>Arab</b> <b>governments,</b> took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of Operation Desert Storm on CNN International underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.|$|E
