The natural <b>asphaltite,</b> employed to modify a petroleum-derived-bitumen, is mined in Albania. At a first time, penetration,ring ball temperature and rheological properties of both <b>asphaltite</b> and pure petroleum bitumen are determined. Then, the petroleum bitumen is mixed with 5, 10 and 15 % of natural bitumen and the penetration and ring ball temperature of the blends are assessed. In addition to this, rheological tests are performed on the 10 % blend.

Based on the experimental results and assuming that the material follows the time-temperature superposition principle (TTSP), master curves of complex modulus and of phase angle are constructed.

This evolution is explained by the physicochemical composition of the <b>asphaltite</b> which presents high asphaltene agglomerates content.

40|$|Analysis of 0. 25 - 5 μm {{reflectance}} spectra {{acquired by}} the Visible and InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) onboard Rosetta orbiter revealed that the surface of comet 67 P/CG is dark from the near-UV to the IR and is enriched in refractory phases such as organic and opaque components. The broadness {{and complexity of the}} ubiquitous absorption feature around 3. 2 μm suggest a variety of cometary organic constituents. For example, complex hydrocarbons can contribute to the feature between 3. 2 and 3. 5 μm and to the low reflectance of the surface in the visible. Relevance of natural macromolecular solids, such as solid oil bitumens (<b>asphaltites,</b> kerites, anthraxolites) and coals as spectral analogs for the hydrocarbon part of cometary refractory organics were discussed in detail in the literature. Fine-grained opaque refractory phases (e. g. iron sulfides, Fe-Ni alloys) are likely responsible for the low IR reflectance and low contrast of the 3. 2 μm absorption band. Other non-icy constituents that may contribute to spectral reflectance properties of the 67 P surface include amorphous and crystalline silicates. Here we report and discuss the 0. 3 - 5 μm reflectance spectra of relevant Fe-sulfides (meteoritic troilite and several terrestrial pyrrhotites) ground and sieved to various particle sizes. We report the results of the synthesis, analyses, and/or spectral reflectance measurements of Fe-free low-Ca pyroxenes (ortho- and clinoenstatites), forsterites, and a high-Ca pyroxene (diopside). We present reflectance spectra of intimate mixtures of powdered Fe-sulfides with kerite (as an example of a relevant macromolecular organic solid) and synthetic orthoenstatite. We investigate and discuss the ability of Fe-sulfides to suppress absorption bands of other cometary refractory components and to affect the spectral slopes and reflectance values of the 67 P/CG surface at different wavelengths from the near-UV to the IR. Finally, we discuss the evolution of organic absorption bands as a function of sulfide content in the mixtures and the possibility for detection of individual C-H stretching bands in the VIRTIS spectra of 67 P/CG. We show that spectral reflectance of the ubiquitous dark material on the surface of 67 P is mostly controlled by fine-grained opaques and organic refractories, while silicate components play a less significant role and are unlikely to contribute significantly to the VIRTIS spectra and to the observed spectral variations across the 67 P surface. We demonstrate that fine-grained Fe-sulfides (troilite and pyrrhotite) are effective darkening agents from the near UV to IR that can explain the very low IR reflectance of the 67 P nucleus. The shape of the VIRTIS spectra in the visible range is consistent with the presence of polyaromatic-rich organics together with Fe-sulfides. Fe-sulfides intimately mixed with other components significantly influence shapes and relative contrasts of absorption bands of other phases. If real, the fine structure in the VIRTIS spectra between 3. 2 and 3. 5 μm could be indicative of individual C-H absorption bands in aromatic structures, methyl and methylene groups. Further work is needed to clarify which species contribute to the broad complex 3. 2 -μm band in the VIRTIS spectra and to the spectral shape between 1. 5 and 2. 5 μm...|$|R

40|$|Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) and Centaurs show {{remarkable}} colour {{variations in}} the visual and near-infrared spectral regions. Surface alteration processes such as space weathering (e. g., bombardment with ions) and impact resurfacing may {{play an important role}} in the colour diversity of such bodies. Ion irradiation of hydrocarbon ices and their mixtures with water ice transforms neutral (grey) surface colours of ices to red and further to grey. Along with the ices, TNOs and Centaurs probably contain complex carbonaceous compounds, in particular, complex hydrocarbons. Unlike ices, such refractory organic materials have originally low visual albedos and red colours in the visible and near-infrared ranges. Here we present the first results of ion irradiation experiments on <b>asphaltite.</b> <b>Asphaltite</b> is a natural complex hydrocarbon material. The reflectance spectra of <b>asphaltite</b> in the 0. 4 - 0. 8 microns range have been recorded before irradiation and after each irradiation step. We demonstrate that irradiation of this red dark material with 30 keV H+ and 15 keV N+ ions gradually transforms its colour from red to grey as a result of carbonization. A moderate increase in the visual albedo has been observed. These results may imply that the surfaces of primitive red objects optically dominated by complex refractory organics may show a similar space weathering trend. Our laboratory results were compared with published colours of TNOs and Centaurs. A broad variety of spectral colours observed for TNOs and Centaurs may be reproduced by various spectra of irradiated organics corresponding to different ion fluences. However, such objects probably also contain ices and silicate components which show different space weathering trends. This fact, together with a lack of information about albedos, may explain difficulties to reveal correlations between surface colours within TNO and Centaur populations and their other properties, such as absolute magnitudes and orbital parameters...|$|E
