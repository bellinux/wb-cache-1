A patent was filed in 1934. The design was used in their console radios beginning in 1936. A loudspeaker enclosure based on the concept was proposed in October 1965 by Dr A.R. Bailey and A.H. Radford in Wireless World (p483-486) magazine. The article postulated that energy {{from the rear of}} a driver unit could be essentially absorbed, without damping the cone's motion or superimposing internal reflections and resonance, so Bailey and Radford reasoned that the rear wave could be channeled down a long pipe. If the acoustic energy was absorbed, it would not be available to excite resonances. A pipe of sufficient length could be tapered, and stuffed so that the energy loss was almost complete, minimizing output from the open end. No broad consensus on the ideal taper (expanding, uniform cross-section, or contracting) has been established.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} sound {{absorption}} effect of microperforated panels (MPPs) in small-scale enclosures, an effort {{stemming from the}} recent interests in using MPPs for noise control in compact mechanical systems. Two typical MPP backing cavity configurations (an empty backing cavity and a honeycomb backing structure) are studied. Although both configurations provide basically the same sound absorption curves from standard impedance tube measurements, their in situ sound absorption properties, when placed inside a small enclosure, are drastically different. This phenomenon is explained using a simple system model based on modal analyses.

A general procedure, comprising a Wavelet-Garlerkin formulation and a so-called vertex-driven shape optimization is proposed {{to deal with the}} general problem of internal sound field prediction and the optimization of the boundary shape. It is shown that, owing to the compactly supported orthogonal property and the remarkable fitting ability, Daubechies Wavelet {{can be used as a}} global basis to approximate the unknown sound field on a relatively large interval globally instead of piecewise approximation like most of element based methods do. This feature avoids meshing the boundary of the enclosure, although vertex points are needed to define the boundary shape, whose positions keep updating during the shape optimization process. A rectangular enclosure is used as benchmark to assess and validate the proposed formulation, by investigating the influence of some key parameters involved in the formulation. It was shown that the sound pressure along the entire boundary of the rectangular enclosure can be accurately approximated without meshing. The same enclosure with an inner rigid acoustic screen is then used to reduce the sound pressure level within a chosen area through optimizing the shape of the screen, which shows the remarkable potentials of the proposed approach as a shape optimal tool for inner sound field problems.

The scope of this work involved the modeling, simulation, construction, and implementation of these passive and active control concepts.

First a passive design methodology based on a parametrically defined FEM (finite element method) model, coupled to a BEM (boundary element method) acoustic model by the modal interaction model approach was developed.

Numerous control approaches were then simulated on the state space model of the 3 -D enclosure system. These simulations explored different algorithms, controller structures, and system arrangements to determine what approaches were best suited to the ASAC problem. Based on these simulations the required setups and control electronics hardware were designed and built.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} small, time-dependent, perturbations to geometric wave-equation domains is hardly existent. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>enclosures</b> are typical examples featuring locally reacting surfaces that {{respond to a}} pressure gradient or a pressure difference, alter the enclosure's volume and, hence, the boundary conditions, and do so locally through their vibrations. Accordingly, the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the acoustic wave equation lives in a temporally varying domain depending on the displacement of the locally reacting surface from equilibrium. The resulting partial differential equations feature nonlinearities and are coupled though the time-dependent boundary conditions. The solution to the afore-mentioned problem, as presented here, integrates techniques from differential geometry, functional analysis, and physics. The appropriate space is {{shown to be a}} (perturbation) fiber bundle. In the context of a systematic perturbation theory, the solution to the dynamical problem is obtained from a combination of semigroup techniques for operator evolution equations and metric perturbation theory as used in AdS/CFT. Duhamel's principle then yields a time-dependent perturbation theory, called geometric perturbation theory. It is analogous to, though different from, both Dirac's time-dependent perturbation theory and the Magnus expansion. Specifically, the formalism demonstrates that the stationary-domain approximation for vibrational acoustics only introduces a small error. Analytic simplifications methods are derived in the framework of the piston approximation. Globally reacting surfaces (so-called pistons) replace the formerly locally reacting surfaces and reduce the number of independent variables in the underlying partial differential equations. In this way, a straightforwardly applicable formalism is derived for scalar wave equations on time-varying domains. Comment: 121 pages and 16 figure...|$|R

A method called Energy Flow Analysis has been developed to predict the structural responses in homogenous systems such as rods, beams, plates, and acoustic spaces. Additional procedures have been built on these results to predict the responses in coupled systems consisting of rods, beams, and plates. In this research, a structural-acoustic coupling relationship is proposed for energy flow analysis of plates and acoustical spaces. The coupling relationship is derived in terms of plate radiation efficiency. Analytical expressions for radiation efficiency of simple models are readily available in the literature as a function of frequency, geometry, and material properties. ^ The structural-acoustic coupling relationship was implemented into an energy finite element model.
