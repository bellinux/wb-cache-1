500|$|Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{felt that}} the main story {{employed}} [...] "one of the show's most reliable running jokes". Furthermore, he felt that Michael softening to Toby was an interesting element to the episode, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> [...] "this was a one-time thing, or if Michael's treatment of Toby will be softened, even a little." [...] Sepinwall also felt that Pam's story was the stronger of the two subplots, and felt that an office controlled by her would be interesting. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode {{four out of five}} stars and called it [...] "pleasant". While he noted that each of the three stories [...] "weren't flat out funny", he wrote that they were all [...] "enjoyable". Furthermore, he positively commented on the main plot, noting that the Michael and Toby rivalry was fun.|$|E
500|$|On Saturday, 9 July 1720, London v Kent at White Conduit Fields was won by London. In this match, two London fielders {{were badly}} injured by {{a clash of}} heads. H. T. Waghorn noted a lull in the {{advertising}} and reporting of cricket after this game <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> that was due to a perception that the sport was dangerous. If there was a lapse in cricket at this time, the more likely causes would be either: (a) the South Sea Bubble which ruined many investors and so could have reduced cricket patronage; or (b), as Waghorn himself mentions, [...] "the (news)papers were small, and space limited, the advertising and reporting (of) matches ceased". The South Sea Bubble may have had an economic impact on investment and gambling as, when the South Sea Company {{was found to be}} insolvent, its crash in 1720 caused massive repercussions throughout the economy and many formerly prosperous investors were ruined. This could have included cricket patrons, while a potential impact on reporting was the application of stamp duty to newspapers as this increased their publication costs and probably caused publishers to reduce paper size with less room for sports coverage.|$|E

50|$|The scene {{moves to}} modern day Tokyo, where {{the protagonist of}} the story, Takakage Takasaka, wakes up {{realising}} {{he has had a}} wet dream. It confuses him a lot, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> it was only a dream or that really happened. He has breakfast with his stepsister, Maiko. He narrates the day she will join him at a certain University of Arts.|$|R
50|$|Back in Kōchi, {{the third}} year begins with Rikako making a friend, Yumi Kohama. Rikako hasn't {{returned}} Taku's money <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> she has forgotten. Out of the blue, a distressed Yumi calls Taku, explaining that Rikako had tricked her into coming to the airport on the pretence of a concert trip, {{only to discover that}} their real destination is Tokyo, tickets paid for with Taku's money. He races to the airport, sending Yumi home, saying that he will accompany Rikako.|$|R
60|$|STEVE. 'Oh, very well.' First {{he thinks}} there is {{something}} innocent about her request, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> 'innocent' is the right word. 'Well, your business, please?' he demands, like {{the man of the}} world he hopes some day to be.|$|R
6000|$|... “A {{sailing vessel}} of some sort,” {{answered}} Dave, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> {{it could be}} the Golden Eagle, coming back after the storm.|$|E
60|$|Before {{proceeding}} to this extremity, he listened intently. It must be near three o'clock, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> {{all the others}} had left.|$|E

50|$|Atmo and Suryo promised {{each other}} that when their {{respective}} wives gave birth, they would betroth their children to each other. Suryo has a son and names him Romeo, while Atmo has a daughter and names her Juminten. Romeo and Juminten grow up together {{in the village of}} Ngawi, where they spend their youth as friends, until one day Suryo receives a scholarship to a school in London. Being a devoted friend, Atmo volunteers to sell his land to help pay for Suryo and his family to make the move to London. The decision to go to London weighs heavily on Suryo, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> Romeo <b>and</b> Juminten will be given the chance to marry.|$|R
50|$|Jason Bourne takes {{a mission}} to rescue his only friend in the CIA, Martin Lindros, who {{disappeared}} in Africa while tracking shipments of uranium. Once safely back in America, Lindros persuades Bourne to help track the money trail of terrorists buying the nuclear material in Odessa. But once there, Bourne is hampered by confusing flashbacks of unfamiliar places <b>and</b> events <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> someone is brainwashing him in order to throw him off the trail, or worse, if the man he saved in Africa is really Martin Lindros. Now, Bourne must gather evidence while trying to stay {{one step ahead of}} the terrorists who won't let anyone stand in their way.|$|R
60|$|Down to {{the cliffs}} he went, and {{looked across the}} broad blue sea; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> his dream were true, and prayed in the {{bitterness}} of his soul.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it served}} him right," [...] {{answered}} Henry, {{but even as}} he spoke he had to shudder, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> the Indian was really dead or only partly choked to death.|$|E
60|$|Rollo, {{in the act}} of {{sipping a}} liqueur brandy, lowered his glass in surprise. His head was singing {{slightly}} as the result of some rather spirited Bollinger (extra sec), <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> he had heard aright.|$|E
5000|$|The Major-General is soaking {{his feet}} in a hot bath. He has never fought in battle, but remarks that he would perform heroic deeds if he were asked to do so. His wife, Leonora, has been gone all day, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> she is deceiving him. Woodpecker arrives and {{explains}} {{the aftermath of the}} Marchioness's concert. Bunthunder wonders why Woodpecker is telling him this irrelevant story. Woodpecker asks to see Bunthunder's wife. He says that she is [...] "not at home", but Woodpecker goes downstairs looking for her, putting up a screen around Bunthunder and his foot bath. Bunthunder shouts that he will go after Woodpecker as soon as he is dressed.|$|R
60|$|His {{thoughts}} ran swifter <b>and</b> swifter. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{should see}} Helen again. It seemed so unreasonable {{that he should}} not see her again. It must be a dream! Yet surely he would meet her. She at least was real. She was real. <b>He</b> would wake <b>and</b> meet her.|$|R
60|$|The {{suggestion}} {{which her}} words implied came to Jimmy {{as a distinct}} shock. He {{had never thought of}} Edith Hudson in the light of this suggestion, <b>and</b> now <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> there could be any such sentiment as it implied in Edith's heart, but finally he put the idea away with a shrug.|$|R
6000|$|Wilson's blood warmed a little, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> he {{had been}} played upon by those strangers; it {{certainly}} had something of that look. But what could they gain by it? He threw out that suggestion. Tom replied: ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{the very}} {{question}} Strether himself had put to Miss Gostrey, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> he had sounded like that. But HE at least could be more definite. [...] "I'm {{going to take you}} right down to London." ...|$|E
6000|$|Shelton {{turned to}} the window, and stared into the darkness; he would never quite {{understand}} this vagabond, so delicate, so cynical, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> Ferrand had been swallowing down the words, [...] "Why, even you won't be sorry to see my back!" ...|$|E

5000|$|A Jazz Singer parody which {{reverses the}} story by having musical guest Al Jarreau play a popular jazz singer {{who wants to}} become a cantor (hazzan). His father is a disapproving pop-music {{impresario}} played by Levys befuddled Sid Dithers. Hasidic Dithers, four feet tall and cross-eyed behind Coke-bottle glasses, speaks with a thick early vaudeville-style Yiddish accent ("San Fransishky? So how did you came: did you drove, or did you flew?"). The payoff of this parody makes for a classic SCTV moment: Jarreau has become a synagogue cantor, fulfilling his dream against his fathers wishes, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> his father will ever speak to him again, until, during the service, he is interrupted by a disco-clad Dithers standing in the doorway in dancing shoes, spangled jacket, and corn-rowed hair.|$|R
60|$|He mused {{for a few}} moments, {{with the}} spray {{whistling}} about him. He had three things at stake: Evelyn's favor; {{his interest in the}} Clermont Mine; <b>and</b> the timber <b>he</b> expected to find. Two of them were undoubtedly threatened, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> gloomily <b>if</b> <b>he</b> might be bereft of all. Then he drove the forebodings out of his mind.|$|R
60|$|Then, riding {{slowly up}} the hedge bordered road, his {{troubles}} once more assailed him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> {{there was not}} some spot upon the broad earth to which he could fly for retirement until the girls had left Elmhurst for good.|$|E
60|$|She {{was sitting}} on the edge of his desk, looking down at him. Still he did not look at her. All the will that was left him averted his head. And the seal of honor was upon his speech. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> man were ever more tempted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then the worst--we haven't faced that. I {{could face}} it, I believe, if I {{knew what you}} think it.

50|$|Juan is {{smitten with}} the {{beautiful}} Aurora, and thinks of her on retiring. At night, {{he walks into}} the hall, viewing the gallery of paintings. <b>He</b> hears footsteps, <b>and</b> sees a monk in cowl <b>and</b> beads. <b>He</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> it is a ghost, or just a dream. He does not see the monk's face, though <b>he</b> passes <b>and</b> repasses several times.|$|R
50|$|Carlos is unimpressed when {{he discovers}} Gabrielle {{has been taking}} off her wedding ring to flirt with male {{customers}} at her new job {{in order to get}} them to spend huge amounts of money. Gabrielle tells Carlos she's doing what she needs to do. She later treats him to a meal in a fancy restaurant <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> they can afford it, but Gabrielle tells him that he doesn't have to worry about it, as it's her treat. A male client of Gabrielle's turns up during the meal and Carlos becomes angry and leaves when Gabrielle refers to him as her brother. Later on, Carlos tells Gabrielle that he hates {{the fact that she is}} the one making the money and calling the shots but she tells him that he was the one who wanted to quit his job.|$|R
5000|$|A Day for Incantation (...) : In Seoul, winter, {{the present}} day. On {{his way to}} a {{screening}} of one of his films, struggling shorts director Nam Jin-gu (Lee Sun-kyun) is nagged by his wife Jang Su-yang (Seo Yeong-hwa) about his drinking, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> she is {{having an affair with a}} guy called Yeong-su. Nam's onetime professor at film school, Song (Moon Sung-keun), tells him that filmmaking as an art is now dead. Nam remembers his first meeting with his wife, then an impressionable amateur photographer, on a park bench. At a dinner with film-school staff, Nam gets drunk and into a quarrel with Song, about whom he's heard a disquieting rumor. Afterwards, at the Q&A for his film, Nam is asked by a member of the audience (Lee Chae-eun) whether it's true he was dating the actress at the time and is therefore responsible for ruining her life. Nam says he has quit directing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Empty for me?" [...] He {{remembered how}} Kate had held {{that she might}} propose marriage, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> this were the way she would {{naturally}} begin it. It would leave him, such an incident, he already felt, at a loss, and the note of his finest anxiety {{might have been in}} the vagueness of his reply. [...] "Oh well--!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{struck him}} as curious that he could run at all on feet so frozen {{that he could not}} feel them when they struck the earth and took the weight of his body. He seemed to himself to skim along above the surface and to have no {{connection}} with the earth. Somewhere he had once seen a winged Mercury, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> Mercury felt as he felt when skimming over the earth.|$|E
6000|$|Beside a charred pile of timbers the Abyssinians halted, and Tarzan, sneaking {{close and}} concealing himself in nearby shrubbery, watched them in wonderment. He saw them digging up the earth, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> they had hidden meat {{there in the}} past and now had come for it. Then he {{recalled}} how he had buried his pretty pebbles, and the suggestion that had caused him to do it. They were digging for the things the blacks had buried here! ...|$|E
60|$|Tracy's noble {{theories}} and high purposes {{were beginning to}} feel pretty damp <b>and</b> clammy. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> by any possibility {{he had made a}} mistake in throwing his own prosperity to the winds and taking up the cross of other people's unprosperity. But he wouldn't listen to that sort of thing; he cast it out of his mind and resolved to go ahead resolutely along the course he had mapped out for himself.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} Sheldon {{came in from}} the {{plantation}} to breakfast, to find the mission ketch, Apostle, at anchor, her crew swimming two mares and a filly ashore. Sheldon recognized the animals as belonging to the Resident Commissioner, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> immediately <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> Joan had bought them. She was certainly living up to her threat of rattling the dry bones of the Solomons, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was prepared for anything.|$|R
60|$|It did {{not hurt}} him now. A sort of apathy {{seemed to have}} fallen on him. The old days {{became more and more}} remote. Sometimes he doubted whether {{anything}} remained of her former love for him, <b>and</b> sometimes <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> still loved her. She was so different that {{it was almost as if}} she were a stranger. Once they had had everything in common. Now it seemed to him that they had nothing--not even Bill.|$|R
