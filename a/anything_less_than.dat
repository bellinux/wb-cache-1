5|$|The first {{station was}} a {{temporary}} terminus for the GWR {{on the west}} side of Bishop's Bridge Road, opened on 4 June 1838. The first GWR service from London to Taplow, near Maidenhead, ran from Paddington in 1838. After the main station opened, this became the site of the goods depot. Brunel did not consider that <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a grand terminus dedicated to the GWR would be acceptable, and consequently this was approved in February 1853.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} final round of games, both teams were equal on points with Spain, with Scotland ahead thanks to a {{superior}} goal difference; however, Spain's final game at home to Iceland was scheduled to be played two weeks after Wales and Scotland had played each other. With this in mind, a draw for Scotland would be sufficient to virtually guarantee second place in Group 7 and advance at the very least through to the two legged play-off against the winner of the Oceania qualifying tournament, while a win would likely see them top the group and qualify automatically. For Wales, <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a win would virtually end their hopes of qualification.|$|E
5|$|MacGregor was {{introduced}} to Maria Bowater, {{the daughter of a}} Royal Navy admiral, around 1804. Maria commanded a substantial dowry and, apart from her by-now-deceased father, was related to two generals, a member of parliament and the botanist Aylmer Bourke Lambert. Gregor and Maria married at St Margaret's Church, Westminster in June 1805 and set up home in London, at the residence of the bride's aunt. Two months later, having rejoined the 57th Foot in Gibraltar, MacGregor bought the rank of captain for about £900, choosing not to wait the seven years such a promotion might take without purchase. The 57th Foot remained in Gibraltar between 1805 and 1809. During this time MacGregor developed an obsession with dress, rank insignia and medals that made him unpopular in the regiment; he forbade any enlisted man or non-commissioned officer to leave his quarters in <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> full dress uniform.|$|E

5|$|Von der Tann {{also participated}} in the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, on 15–16December. The raid was another attempt to lure out {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet and destroy it, with the whole of the High Seas Fleet {{standing}} by in support. Von der Tann delayed the raid itself by several days, because Admiral Ingenohl was unwilling to send forth the IScouting Group at <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> full strength, and Von der Tann was undergoing routine repairs in early December. The I Scouting Group, along with the II Scouting Group, composed of the four light cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, and Graudenz, and two torpedo boat flotillas, left the Jade at 03:20. Hipper's ships sailed north, through the channels in the minefields, past Heligoland to the Horns Reef light vessel, at which point the ships turned westward, towards the English coast. The main battle squadrons of the High Seas Fleet left in the late afternoon of the 15th. During the night of 15 December, {{the main body of the}} High Seas Fleet encountered British destroyers, and fearing the prospect of a night-time torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{selected}} high-performance practices and working hours on work–life balance are analysed {{with data from}} national surveys of British employees in 1992 and 2000. Alongside long hours, which are {{a constant source of}} negative job-to-home spillover, certain ‘high-performance’ practices have become more strongly related to negative spillover during this period. Surprisingly, dual-earner couples are not especially liable to spillover — if <b>anything,</b> <b>less</b> so <b>than</b> single-earner couples. Additionally, the presence of young children has become less important over time. Overall, the results suggest a conflict between high-performance practices and work-life balance policies...|$|R

25|$|The {{prevalence}} of salarymen in Japanese society has {{given birth to}} many depictions by both the Japanese and American media. Some films in Japan about salarymen include Mr. Salaryman, Japanese Salaryman NEO (based on the TV series), and a drama series entitled History of a Salaryman. There is a certain expectation among {{the middle and upper}} classes for Japanese men to become salarymen. For many young Japanese men, accepting <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> becoming a salaryman and conforming to its ideal is considered a failure, not only of him, but of his parents.|$|E

First-year head coach Chris Petersen led this perennially strong non-BCS conference school to an undefeated 12–0 record. Some of the Broncos key wins this season came over Oregon State of the Pac-10 Conference, Hawaii and Fresno State. Boise State was the champion of the Western Athletic Conference.|$|E

25|$|Only Madrid and a {{few other}} strongholds {{remained}} for the Republican forces. On 5 March 1939 the Republican army, led by the Colonel Segismundo Casado and the politician Julián Besteiro, rose against the prime minister Juan Negrín and formed the National Defence Council (Consejo Nacional de Defensa or CND) to negotiate a peace deal. Negrín fled to France on 6 March, but the Communist troops around Madrid rose against the junta, starting a brief civil war within the civil war. Casado defeated them, and began peace negotiations with the Nationalists, but Franco refused to accept <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> unconditional surrender.|$|E

Now suppose you could amazingly do job A four times over, selling half your work on the market for cash just to pay your tax bill. The other half of the work you do for somebody who does job B twice over but he has to sell off half to pay his tax bill. You're left with one unit of job B, but only if you were 400% as productive doing job A!

We find significant (but not total) uniformity in patterns of income mobility and poverty dynamics across the seven countries. The key exception is Russia, where the economic transition has led to a much higher degree of mobility. Interestingly, the USA, which has the highest level of relative poverty among the rich nations, has a mobility rate which, if <b>anything,</b> is <b>less</b> <b>than</b> that of the other nations...|$|R
25|$|In 1866, {{following}} the Battle of Sadova and the Austrian {{defeat in the}} Austro-Prussian War, the Austro-Hungarian empire began to experience increased internal problems. In an effort to shore up support for the monarchy, Emperor Franz Joseph began negotiations for a compromise with the Magyar nobility to ensure their support. Some members of the government, such as the Austro-Hungarian prime minister Count Belcredi, advised the Emperor to make a more comprehensive constitutional deal {{with all of the}} nationalities that would have created a federal structure. Belcredi worried that an accommodation with the Magyar interests would alienate the other nationalities. However, Franz Joseph was unable to ignore the power of the Magyar nobility, and they would not accept <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> dualism between themselves and the traditional Austrian élites.|$|E

By the end of July {{it was clear that}} the continent was on the brink of hostilities, with Wilson being lobbied by Milner and the diplomat Eyre Crowe about Edward Grey’s reluctance to go to war. Wilson (1 August) called on de la Panouse (French Military Attache) and Paul Cambon (French Ambassador) to discuss the military situation. Wilson may well have been keeping the Conservative leadership informed of discussions between Cambon and Foreign Secretary Grey. The German invasion of Belgium provided a casus belli and Britain mobilized on 3 August and declared war on 4 August.|$|E
25|$|However, the Sultan's {{acceptance}} {{came too}} late to save Ottoman sovereignty over Greece. Buoyed by the Ottoman disasters on land and sea, and their own military successes, the Greeks refused to accept <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> full independence. Finally, at the London Protocol of 1830, the Allies dropped their policy of Ottoman suzerainty and accepted Greek independence, but insisted that the new state should be a monarchy not a republic. Later that year, the Sultan was forced by the Allied powers to sign the Treaty of Constantinople (1832) formally recognizing the new Kingdom of Greece as an independent state. The latter's territory, however, was restricted to just those regions from which Ottoman forces had been expelled, namely the Peloponnese, the Cyclades islands of the Aegean Sea and central Greece. Many regions with an ethnic-Greek majority (Thessaly, Epirus, part of Macedonia and Thrace, the remaining Aegean islands, Crete and Cyprus), remained under Ottoman rule.|$|E
