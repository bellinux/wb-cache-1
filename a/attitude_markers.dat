40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. KîîTharaka is a Bantu {{language}} spoken by a minority community in Kenya numbering about 120, 000. <b>Attitude</b> <b>markers</b> {{belong to the}} broad category of ‘residue’ elements in language commonly called ‘discourse markers’. Alternative terms for discourse markers are: Discourse particles, discourse/speech modifiers, pragmatic markers, pragmatic particles, or discourse operators. As the term ‘attitude’ markers itself suggests, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> may best {{be defined as a}} set of expressions in language which the speaker applies to clarify his or her feelings, emotions or views contained in the utterance being made. <b>Attitude</b> <b>markers</b> ‘amplify’ the speakers intended meaning. Moore (2001 : 5) observes that English speakers use expressive verbs to convey attitudes to or about a state of affairs e. g. ‘apologize’, ‘appreciate’, ‘congratulate’, ‘deplore’, ‘detest’, ‘regret’, ‘thank’, and ‘welcome’. It is such kind of expressions that are investigated in this research on KîîTharaka. This dissertation highlights on this linguistic phenomenon with the view that to ignore the role played by <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> in communicating meaning in KîîTharaka may reduce the accuracy of the speaker’s or the writer’s intended message. Bearing in mind that <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> are similar to discourse markers in that both {{are not part of the}} conceptual (i. e. the referential) information of the speaker’s utterance, the critical distinction to be made between discourse markers and <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> is that unlike discourse markers, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> do not function as connectives i. e. they do not primarily establish discourse cohesion...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master´s {{thesis is}} the {{contrastive}} analysis of discourse markers on a selected type of texts in Spanish and Czech language. The thesis is divided in two parts theoretical and practical part. Firstly, in the theoretical part of the thesis, is introduced the textual linguistic the field which studies discourse markers. For wholeness, are briefly mentioned all of the seven standards of textuality with profound focus on textual coherence. Other part of the thesis aims on terminology of discourse markers (especially on conectores), which is problematic, and various classifications according to Czech and Spanish authors. The {{last part of the}} theoretical part is dedicated to <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> the main theme of this thesis, their characteristics, functions and examples. The practical part of the thesis is introduced by contrastive analysis of <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> carried out on selected sample of texts. Firstly the <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> are identified and secondly described and classified. Also is mentioned the absolute and relative frequency and comparison of the contrasts and coincidences in both languages. The thesis is finally summarized in Spanish résumé...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} interpersonality in {{research}} article abstracts analysed {{in terms of}} interactional metadiscourse. The evolution {{in the distribution of}} three prominent interactional markers comprised in Hyland's (2005 a) model, viz. hedges, boosters and <b>attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> is investigated in three decades of abstract writing in the field of applied linguistics in the broad sense. On the basis of a quantitative corpus survey of abstracts in Journal of Pragmatics, two major points are made. One is that the distribution of hedges, boosters and <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> in abstracts, when compared with their distribution in research articles, supports the idea that abstracts are not just pale reflections of the full-length articles, but rather have a specific make-up, which can plausibly be linked to their function. The second point is that the use of interactional metadiscourse in abstracts has undergone interesting changes {{in the course of the}} past 30 years. On the whole, the degree of interpersonality realised by hedges, boosters and <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> diminishes over time, though notable differences exist with regard to the subcategories in the interactional domain. In the discussion section, we try to arrive at an explanation for the changes that have occurred, taking genre, discourse community, research practice and rhetoric strategy into account. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This study extends recent {{investigations}} of onscreen marking (OSM) in the Hong Kong public examination context. It examines whether <b>marker</b> <b>attitudes,</b> which have shown increasing acceptance of OSM {{since it was}} first introduced in 2007, continue to develop this acceptance in a different context. In 2012, all pubic examinations were marked onscreen. While previous studies investigated the <b>attitudes</b> of mature <b>markers</b> marking extended essay answers for single subjects (English and Liberal Studies), the current study examines the attitudes and perceptions of much younger markers when marking short, objective answer questions in the 2012 Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination Use of English. In addition, because the markers were younger than usual, {{the issue of whether}} their attitudes to OSM were affected by the ownership of a tablet computer was also investigated. The findings, which have implications for other examination jurisdictions, indicate a growing acceptance of OSM, especially by tablet owners...|$|R

However, most studies have been underpowered and demonstrate elements of a statistical 'fishing exercise', that is the carrying out of a huge number of analyses to find a hint of importance for a particular marker. RECENT FINDINGS: Recently some well powered analyses using separate development and validation datasets and multivariate statistics have been published and these are starting to change <b>attitudes</b> towards such <b>markers.</b> SUMMARY: Although there are very limited markers in standard clinical practice, we feel that there are now some that are ready to be translated into routine use or that at least deserve some further attention and 'service assessment'...|$|R
40|$|This article {{gives an}} {{overview}} of Flemish children’s books on World War I published between 1973 and 2014. It {{is based on a}} text analysis, focussing on the informative, divertive, emotional and moral functions. Information is in¬herent to the genre: the author takes the readers back into a period they are not familiar with. However, {{in order to keep the}} readers captivated, authors deploy the divertive function, with humour and suspense as the most important seducers. The analysis reveals how suspense is worked out in the stories. Dealing with the emotional function, the study identifies which means the authors use to enhance the chances of possible identification and empathy. Referring to the moral function, I studied the war ‘image’ or ‘frame’ constructed by the novels, analysing the selection of facts, the characters’ <b>attitudes</b> and linguistic <b>markers</b> or framing devices that reveal the author’s attitude or commitment to the topics dealt with in the text. In the conclusion constants and evolutions in the complex of functions are interpreted by situating them in a social-cultural context. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Vande Kopple’s (1985) {{classification}} for meta-discourse included textual {{and interpersonal}} main categories. Textual meta-discourse constituted text connectives, code glosses, validity markers, and narrators. Interpersonal meta-discourse also included illocution markers, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> and commentaries. Crismore et al. (1993) then provided a revised categorization of meta-discourse, including two major categories of textual and interpersonal. However, textual component was subdivided into textual markers (logical connectives, sequencers, reminders, and topicalizers) and interpretive markers (code glosses, illocution markers, and announcements). The interpersonal aspect was also reorganized into hedges, certainty markers, attributors, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> and commentary. Hyland (2005) also proposed a models which comprises two major categories, including interactive MDMs, which concern the writer’s awareness of {{and attention to}} his readers and interactional MDMs, which refer to writer’s attempts to make his views more explicit for the readers.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the features of}} stance in tweets downloaded from the English Twitter accounts of Boko Haram and Al Shabaab, referred to as ‘radicalist discourse’. Stance, referred to as ‘positioning’ or point of views of tweeters, is {{defined in terms of}} features such as hedges, boosters, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> self-mention and threats. These express commitment, attitude and judgement of writers on the issues being discussed. Applying mostly qualitative analysis, the study shows that self-mention and <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> are the most prevalent features of stance in radicalist discourse. Thus, stance is used to express triumph, satisfaction, anger and hate by the radical groups under study. The various expressions of attitude and self-mention in the data portray positive construction of in-group and negative evaluation of others (i. e. governments and institutions) referred to as infidels and apostates...|$|E
40|$|Writers {{can apply}} {{interpersonal}} metadiscourse markers to encode an interaction {{and build a}} relationship with their readers. In some particular genres, such as newspaper discourse, they can even be used as means of attaining persuasive goals. Initiated by the idea, the present writer attempts to explore the use of interpersonal metadiscourse markers in Indonesian newspaper opinion articles. This present study aims to investigate interpersonal metadiscourse categories and subcategories applied and most predominantly occuring {{in the type of}} newspaper article. For the data, eleven selected articles of an Indonesian newspaper were taken to analyze by using Dafouz’s (2008) classification of interpersonal metadiscourse markers. Results reveal that interpersonal metadiscourse categories (hedges, certainty markers, attributors, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> and commentaries) and subcategories (epistemic verbs, probability adverbs, deontic verbs, attitudinal adverbs, attitudinal adjectives, cognitive verbs, rhetorical questions, inclusive expressions, personalizations, and asides) were used in Indonesian opinion articles.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the role of}} two cognitive vulnerability factors, anxiety sensitivity and dysfunctional attitudes, in the prediction of the manifestation and onset of social anxiety disorder relative to specific phobia and relative to healthy controls. Women, aged between 18 and 24 years, were studied at baseline and 18 months later using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Lifetime-ADIS-IV-L and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-ASI and the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale-DAS. First, 52 women with current social anxiety disorder were compared to 97 women with current specific phobia and 1124 healthy controls (cross-sectional analysis). Second, 24 women with a first incidence of social anxiety disorder were compared to 55 women with a first incidence of specific phobia and 684 healthy controls (longitudinal analysis). Multiple logistic regression analyses, adjusted for baseline anxiety and depressive severity, revealed that a) dysfunctional attitudes were elevated in women with current social anxiety disorder versus healthy controls {{as well as women}} with current specific phobia in the cross-sectional analysis and b) dysfunctional attitudes were elevated in women who subsequently developed social anxiety disorder versus healthy controls in the longitudinal analysis. However, dysfunctional attitudes were not predictive for women who developed social anxiety disorder during the study relative to women who developed specific phobia. The results suggest that dysfunctional <b>attitudes</b> are a <b>marker</b> of severity for social anxiety disorder relative to other phobias and a risk factor for phobias more generally. Anxiety sensitivity seems not to contribute to the manifestation and onset of social anxiety disorders...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Aegean domain is a well-suited {{place to}} study the {{formation}} of metamorphic core complex (MCC) and to investigate the role of syn-tectonic granites on their development. In the northern Cyclades, the Mykonos-Delos-Rhenia MCC is characterised by the intrusion of a kilometer-scale Late Miocene pluton of I-type granitoids within a migmatitic gneiss dome. New combined AMS (Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility) and microstructural studies on the Mykonos granitoids together with recently published thermochronological data allow us to use the granitoids as strain markers. The Mykonos granitoids form a laccolith-like intrusion with a N 70 °E long axis. The laccolith is strongly asymmetric with an outlying root zone to the SW and a major body mainly developed to the NE. The laccolith construction is due to successive pulses of more or less differentiated magma that intruded the Cycladic Blueschist Unit. The <b>attitude</b> of stretching <b>markers</b> suggests an important (about 60 °) vertical-axis local rotation phenomenon in the cycladic upper crust during the exhumation of the Mykonos MCC. Structural data suggest a four-stage evolution of the Mykonos MCC: (i) a first stage characterized by flat shearing toward the N-NE and by {{the formation of a}} domal structure in migmatitic paragneisses with multi-scale generation of folds with axes either perpendicular or parallel to the regional stretching, {{as a result of the}} interplay between regional N 20 E°-directed extension and EW shortening; (ii) a second stage marked by the emplacement of the Mykonos laccolith at 13. 5 ± 0. 3 Ma at the top of the migmatitic paragneisses; (iii) the third stage corresponding to the development of protomylonitic foliations and lineations in the whole laccolith in high to medium temperature conditions; (iv) the late stage marked by an acceleration of the exhumation of the Mykonos MCC. This exhumation was accommodated by important rotations of upper crustal blocks. During the end of the exhumation processes, around 10 Ma, deformation localized at the top of the laccolith in semi-ductile conditions and then in brittle conditions in the major detachment plane. Our study shows that the Cycladic plutonism event had no role on the initiation of the MCC. However, the geometry of the Mykonos intrusion supports that the magmas are "sucked" into the direction of regional extension and that the intrusion of magmas has caused an acceleration of the last stages of the MCC development. This acceleration was marked by a very fast exhumation of the laccolith after its emplacement...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the tendency of Iranian and American writers for self-representation which is realized by means of writers’ explicit (first person self-references) and implicit self (imperative forms and <b>attitude</b> <b>markers)</b> in computer engineering research articles. In this study, 40 published research articles written in English by Iranian and American academics were analyzed to determine the distribution of first person pronouns, imperative forms and <b>attitude</b> <b>markers.</b> We have also examined the semantic references of plural pronoun ‘we’ as inclusive or exclusive according to their functions.

40|$|One of {{language}} features {{which can be}} applied to reach the persuasive goal is interpersonal metadiscourse. Although it has been frequently investigated in written texts, research on interpersonal metadiscourse in campaign speeches is still relatively hard to find, whereas a lot of features of interpersonal metadiscourse in campaign speeches are used as persuasive strategies. This study aims to explain the meaning of interpersonal metadiscourse markers applied in Barack Obama’s campaign speeches related to his persuasive strategy. The data are analyzed by using Dafouz’s (2008) theory of interpersonal metadiscourse markers categorization. The method used in this study is descriptive qualitative. The results reveal that all interpersonal metadiscourse markers categories, namely hedges, certainty markers, attributors, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> and commentaries, are used in Barack Obama’s campaign speeches. High frequency of use of <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> and commentaries shows that Obama in his campaign speeches tries to build emotional ties with his audience as his persuasive strategy...|$|E
40|$|Speakers {{use some}} {{interactional}} resources to convey their feelings or feedbacks to the prepositional content {{and attempt to}} build personal relationships with the listeners. Two of these resources are attitude and engagement markers and are used to express speakers’ attitudes to preposition and to build relationships with listeners, respectively. This study intended to analyze the use of attitude and engagement markers in native English student presentations. To this end, eleven student presentations were extracted from the MiCASE corpus and analyzed to ascertain the use of attitude and engagement markers using Hyland (2005) taxonomy. The results showed that students try more to engage listeners and build relationships with them to ensure they are attentive and follow the presentations. The most common engagement markers were “you” and “see”. These two markers engage speakers and listeners in an explicit manner. <b>Attitude</b> <b>markers</b> received less attention compared with engagement markers; the most common attitude marker found in the presentations was “interesting”. The {{results of this study}} could be included in instructions on how students should use interactive resources such as engagement and <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> in their presentations...|$|E

30|$|Besides, Hyland (2005, 2007) views {{interactional}} meta-discourse categories as {{markers of}} authorial stance. Stance {{is the way}} writers convey their attitudes, feelings, judgments, opinions, and commitments toward the propositional content. A similar {{way of looking at}} authorial stance is proposed by Vassileva (2000) but under the term authorial presence. She recognizes two types of linguistic means of authorial presence realizations: means of direct indication of authorial presence (first person pronouns) and means of indirect indications of presence and/or discourse depersonalization (passive constructions, hedges, the generic form one) (Vassileva, 2000, pp. 47 – 8). In this scheme, passive constructions and generic form are not mentioned in Hyland’s framework. Boosters and <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> are also absent in Vassileva’s framework. Thus, the proper authorial stance, which is established in academic writing, highly contributes to interpersonal functions of the RA.|$|E

Both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to analyse the texts in the corpora. The analysis revealed that there were some cultural differences in the amounts and types of metadiscourse. The incidence of evidential, endophorics, code glosses, boosters, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> self-mentions were fewer in Turkish students’ master thesis abstracts. However, Turkish students used metadiscourse transitions, frame markers and hedges more than USA students. Pedagogical implications were provided in light of empirical data...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{original}} {{impetus for}} this cross-linguistic study {{came from a}} need to explore the effect of cultural factors and generic conventions on the use and distribution of metadiscourse within a single genre. To this end, the study as a contrastive rhetoric research examined a corpus of 60 newspaper editorials (written in English and Persian) culled from 10 elite newspapers in America and Iran. Based on Hyland's (2005) model of metadiscourse, both interactive and interactional metadiscoursive resources were analysed. The results disclosed that genre conventions had a determining role in the writers’ choice of some metadiscourse resources that contributed to some similarities in the use and distribution of metadiscourse resources across English and Persian data. In addition, some {{differences were found between}} two sets of editorials which were attributed to cultural/linguistic backgrounds of both groups of editorialists. The interactional category and <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> proved to be, respectively the predominant metadiscourse category and subcategory in newspaper editorials genre.

40|$|The {{view that}} {{academic}} writing is purely objective, impersonal and informational, {{which is often}} reflected in English for Academic Purposes materials, has been criticized {{by a number of}} researchers. By now, the view of academic writing as embodying interaction among writers, readers and the academic community as a whole has been established. Following this assumption, the present study focused on how second/foreign language writers enact, construct, and invent themselves through writing. In this study, the theoretical stance on identity is grounded on Ivanič’s (1998) four interrelated aspects of writer identity, namely autobiographical self, discoursal self, authorial self, and possibilities for self-hood in the socio-cultural and institutional contexts. Hyland’s model of metadiscourse (2004 a) was used as the analytical tool for analyzing texts. Based on a corpus of 30 research articles, the overall distribution of evidential markers, hedges, boosters, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> and self-mentions were calculated across four rhetorical sections (Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Discussion and Conclusion) of the research articles. According to the results of this study, identity is a critical aspect of writing which should be brought into the mainstream of second/foreign language writing pedagogy through consciousness -raising or the specific teaching of certain features...|$|E

This academic genre has recently been the focus of increasing number of studies due to its evaluative and interactional nature. The present cross-cultural study aimed to explore how interpersonal metadiscourse was used in Turkish and English book reviews. The corpus used in this study consisted of 150 published book reviews from different disciplines in English and Turkish. In order to understand how writers engaged in their reviews and interacted with their readers, Hyland's (2000) metadiscourse model was used to identify interpersonal markers in book reviews. With a focus of five common features from this model, hedges, emphatics (boosters), <b>attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> relational markers, and person markers were used as categories to be investigated. Relying on a quantitative data analysis followed by qualitative analysis, {{it was found that the}} total number of interpersonal metadiscourse features was considerably higher in the English corpus than in the Turkish corpus.

This paper presents an approach for 3 D reconstruction from image sequences taken with a weakly calibrated camera with no need for approximations for position and <b>attitude,</b> <b>markers</b> on the ground, or even ground control. The generated 3 D reconstruction result is relative, i. e., the scale is not known, but Euclidean, that is, right angles are preserved. The paper shows that the approach allows to produce a 3 D reconstruction consisting of points, camera positions and orientations, as well as vertically oriented planes from image sequences taken with a Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) under challenging wind conditions and without navigation information. Finally, the paper discusses how sequences can be linked into networks, or also images into blocks, clarifying which image configurations exist {{and how they can}} be adequately treated when prior knowledge about them is available...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the misuses of two main categories of metadiscourse markers used by a group of university students. To this end, 50 EFL learners of intermediate language proficiency level were chosen by means of administering a TOEFL proficiency test. The participants were female junior students majoring in English literature at Kerman Azad University. These learners were regarded as intermediate ones scoring 400 - 550 in the proficiency test. Then, the learners were provided with an argumentative topic to write a 250 -word essay in 45 minutes. The number of misuses of metadiscourse markers were counted with regard to their use of textual and interpersonal markers of this kind, and the subcategories of textual (logical connectives, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, and code glosses), and the subcategories of interpersonal metadiscourse markers (hedges, emphatics, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> relational markers, and person markers). Moreover, different classifications of misuses were explored. The results of Chi-square analysis indicated that misuses of metadiscourse makers can be due to overuse of these markers (e. g. logical connective and person markers), punctuation,interlingua, and intralinguaerrors. Finally, using a Pearson correlation to investigate the correlation between the participants’ TOEFL score and essay score, it was concluded that language proficiency has a positive relationship with the uses of metadiscourse markers and essays quality...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} a corpus of ninety discussion sections of applied linguistics research articles, {{with the goal}} of analyzing different aspects of academic written discourse. Three types of texts were considered: English texts written by native speakers of English, English texts written by Iranians (as non-natives of English), and Persian texts written by Iranians. In order to understand the cultural differences between Persian and English-speaking researchers, the following metadiscourse sub-types adapted from Hyland's (2004) model were examined: transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, code glosses, hedges, boosters, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> engagement markers, and self-mentions. The first five comprise interactive metadiscourse, and the rest comprise interactional metadiscourse. After the detailed analysis of the metadiscourse types in question, chi-square tests were carried out to clarify the probable differences. The analysis revealed how academic writings of these groups differed in their rhetorical strategies using metadiscourse type because of their respective mother tongues. However, the different groups were found to use all sub-types of metadiscourse. Yet, some subcategories were used differently by the writers of these two languages. In addition, interactive metadiscoursal factors (those resources which help to guide the reader through the text such as transitions, frame markers, etc.) were used significantly more than interactional metadiscoursal factors (those resources involve the reader in the argument such as hedges, boosters, etc.) by both groups...|$|E
40|$|Building on {{previous}} studies that suggest notable differences between levels {{of writing and}} disciplines, this study investigates stance devices across two parameters: disciplinary differences and academic level of the writer. It investigates disciplinary differences in terms of writer-reader interactions {{in the domain of}} academic writing and how disciplinary communities employ stance markers in research articles. This study also examines what strategies student writers and academics employ in terms of identity within their own writing and how these writers convey their ideas and present themselves. Based on a corpus of 39 academic research articles, this comparative study, following Hyland 2 ̆ 7 s (2005 a) framework, explores whether four categories of stance features (hedges, boosters, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> and self-mentions) show any similarities and differences across the disciplines of Civil Engineering and Applied Linguistics and student and expert writing. The results showed that student writing featured more stance markers than those written by academics, although the differences were small. Moreover, the results revealed cross-disciplinary differences in terms of the frequency of stance markers. The Applied Linguistics research articles contained more stance markers than those in Civil Engineering with a large discrepancy particularly in the use of self-mentions. Findings from this research may help inform student writers and writing instructors about the use of stance markers in academic research articles and help particularly students promote their way of presenting their opinions and themselves in the text...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to describe}} rhetorical moves, metadiscourse types and resources used {{to accompany the}} moves in English abstract section of undergraduate students’ (thesis) article at STKIP PGRI Jombang. Moreover, this research also explains how the metadiscourse functions are applied {{in relation to the}} moves. The method of this study is qualitative research. The data collected using non-participant observation method and note taking techniques were analyzed with the theory of rhetorical moves in abstracts and metadiscourse. The results show that from 42 abstracts, only few abstracts from science belong to informational abstracts. Humanities tends to use three moves with the pattern PMR (Purpose, Method, Results); meanwhile, science andsocial science tend to use four moves with the pattern BPMR (Background, Purpose, Method, Results). On the whole, interactional metadiscourse is infrequently used. In terms of functions of metadiscourse in relation to moves, discourse goal (sub-type of frame markers) characterizes Move 2. Then, the resources of boosters which characterize move 4 are show, found, obtained, embodied, and revealed. Conclude (resources of frame markers sub-type—discourse stage) characterizes move 5. Some metadiscourse types related to the moves applied are evidentials, hedges, boosters, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> and self-mentions. There are also certain resources in certain metadiscourse types which exist in certain move such as the resource of transitions and code glosses. In conclusion, only few abstracts from science support support Day’s (1995) model. In the use of metadiscourse, the use of interactive metadiscourse is dominant. From 10 types of metadiscourse, transitions are frequently employed...|$|E
40|$|Metadiscourse is an {{appealing}} field of inquiry which {{plays an important}} role in organizing and producing persuasive writing, based on the norms and expectations of people involved. The fuzziness of the term Metadiscourse remains obscure as it is seen in the literature. Having based this work on Ken Hyland’s framework for Metadiscourse, the researchers applied his definition and classification of the term. Hyland describes Metadiscourse as the linguistic resources used to organize a discourse or the writer’s stance towards either its content or the reader. He has divided Metadiscourse into two broad groups: Interactive and Interactional. The former being subcategorized into: Transitions, Frame markers, Endophoric markers, Evidentials, and Code-glosses. And the later being divided into Hedges, Boosters, <b>Attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> Engagement markers, and Self-mentions (Hyland, 2005). Focusing on these categorizations, the researchers would try to shed light on the Metadiscourse features applied in “Alice in Wonderland”, selected from the ‘Complete Illustrated Lewis Carroll’, and see how and to what extent Lewis Carroll has applied these Metadiscourse markers to make his story more impressive and persuasive. Of course, Hedges have not been counted in this novel because of the many works done about this marker earlier. The results of the study showed that the frequencies in Interactive/Interactional Metadiscourse groups have no meaningful differences. However, the frequencies demonstrate that the author has been fully aware of the norms of writing. The results of the study have pedagogical implications for teaching English Literature for literature students and language learners at pre-, upper-, and high-intermediate levels of language learning courses...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the ways English native and Arab EFL student writers in a UK university from two disciplines (i. e. Linguistics and Literature) use language in their master’s dissertations to interact with readers. How they present themselves and convey judgements and opinions, and how they connect with readers and establish rapport were examined by the employment of Hyland’s (2005 b) model of stance and engagement, which encompasses nine categories: hedges, boosters, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> self-mentions, reader references, directives, asides, questions, and references to shared knowledge. The primary data used consisted of a corpus of 39 master’s dissertations and discourse-based semi-structured interviews with 15 of the writers. While a corpus analysis helped to reveal which features were overused and which ones were underused, interviews were conducted to discover more about {{how and why the}} writer participants used such features in their academic writing. The findings suggest that {{while it is true that}} both disciplinary community and cultural background are very likely to have an impact on the way writers position themselves and their readers, there are other factors related to the students’ conceptions of academic writing in general and their audience in particular which appear to have a more vital role in the writers’ use of stance and engagement markers. These include personality differences, stylistic preferences, previous education, and supervisors’ comments and advice. The thesis closes by exploring the implications of this study for both EAP writing pedagogy and dissertation supervision and proposing some new directions for future research...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{metadiscourse}} in the dissertation abstracts {{written by}} Native Speakers of Turkish (NST), Turkish Speakers of English (TSE) and Native Speakers of English (NSE) in the Social Sciences {{to determine how}} they make use of metadiscourse devices. It attempts to determine whether student writers from a shared cultural background (Turkish) tend to use similar rhetorical features to those of their mother tongue or harmonise themselves with the language (English) {{in which they are}} writing. Metadiscourse as a rhetorical device for the effective use of language facilitates writers in guiding their readers, conveying their ideas, establishing and determining the social distance of the reader-writer relationship, and creating an involved style of writer persona or a more remote stance. In that sense, interactive resources employed by writers help readers to find the information needed and interactional resources convey to readers the personality of the writers and their assertions. In addition, using ‘more personal’ resources is a way of keeping readers more intentionally within the text to interpret what is proposed by the writers personally and to judge them. The overall aim of the study is to compare and contrast 90 abstracts of dissertations produced by native Turkish speakers (30), native English speakers (30) and Turkish speakers of English (30) in the Social Sciences and to consider how writing in English (L 2) deviates from writing in Turkish (L 1) and becomes closer to the target language in terms of the metadiscourse elements, that is, interactive resources (transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials and code glosses) and interactional resources (hedges, boosters, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> engagement markers and self-mentions). ...|$|E
40|$|Discourse markers (henceforth DMs, also {{referred}} to as pragmatic markers or discourse particles) deal with units of conversation which have a connecting function, but which do not affect the truth-conditionality of the sentence. They are often associated with spoken language and have the tendency to appear initially (Schourup 1999). However, some DMs can also occur in written texts and in final position, which is admitted to be a rare position for DMs (Fraser 1999). The right periphery is the place where the stated message is accessible to both the speaker and the hearer: it is a strategic place to comment on the message and to express attitudes (Waltereit & Detges 2004). In the right periphery, DMs tend to have an interpersonal function (Brinton 1996), rather than an information-structuring one. The assumption of this paper is that DMs are essential for interaction. The hypothesis is that we should find DMs in all forms of languages based in communication, including communication with writing constraints. In this paper, I choose to analyse a corpus of text messages. Text messages belong to a wider and recent communication type: computer mediated communication (CMC). Some authors (among them Hård af Segerstad 2005) compared CMC to “transcribed” oral discourse. Texting is a quite spontaneous CMC type in which writing constraints are determined by the communication medium (space, cost, time, encoding) and by the communication situation. Based on a corpus of 25, 859 French text messages gathered in Belgium from French native speakers, this paper presents the three most frequent DMs that occur in right periphery, namely quoi, alors and donc. In addition, this paper shows how DMs, following the classification of Jucker and Ziv (1998) and Brinton (1996), present a range of interactional functions: intimacy signals, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> hedging devices, face savings devices, deference signals, confirmation requests, etc...|$|E
40|$|Theme: The Third International Symposium on Chinese Language and DiscourseThe Booklet can {{be viewed}} at: [URL] view of the {{increasing}} importance of the Chinese language internationally {{now and in the}} future, research published in Chinese will be receiving more attention, and how to write about research in this language is worth studying, including the writing of PhD dissertations. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to report on the findings of an analysis of the discourse of 60 Chinese PhD dissertations. These dissertations are from a leading comprehensive university in China, covering six disciplines – applied linguistics, public administration, business studies, computer science, electronic engineering and biology. The analysis was conducted from three perspectives. Firstly, the structures of these dissertations were identified, being the traditional-complex type (Introduction-Literature Review-Methodology-Results/Findings-Discussion –Conclusions) or topic-based (Introduction-Theme/Topic 1 -Theme/Topic 2 -Theme/Topic 3 -Conclusion) (Paltridge, 2003). Then the genetic moves in the Introduction chapter and the Conclusion chapter were analyzed using the genre approach (Swales, 1990). These moves include general background to the study, general review of the literature, and general introduction to the main study in the Introduction; summary of major findings, overall conclusions (and implications), and directions for future research in the Conclusion, albeit some are field-oriented while others are thesis-oriented. Finally linguistic devices employed by the authors to express stances were examined, including the use of hedges (eg. keneng [may], jianyi [suggest]), boosters (eg. xian’er yijian [obviously], shiji shang [in fact]), <b>attitude</b> <b>markers</b> (eg. ling ren chijing de shi [surprisingly], you yisi de shi [interestingly]), engagement markers (eg. zhuyi [note that], (duzhe/nin) keyi kanchu [you can see that]), and self-mentions (eg. wo [I] and wo’men [we]) (Hyland, 2004). These perspectives were then compared cross disciplines with a view to delineating the construction of disciplinary identities (Hyland, 2012). Being expandable to include a larger number of dissertations in more disciplines, this research will enrich the literature on academic writing in Chinese. It will also have useful implications for writing Chinese PhD dissertations as well as the teaching of it...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a mixed-method genre-based study which {{analyzes}} the Discussion section of {{qualitative and quantitative}} research articles {{in the field of}} Applied Linguistics. It is particularly focused on examining the generic structures and stance features of these two sets of articles. The study consists of two main parts. In the first part, 15 qualitative and 15 quantitative RAs’ Discussion sections were analyzed employing Swales’ (1990, 2004) move structure model. In {{the second part of the}} study, Hyland’s (1999, 2005, 2008) taxonomy of stance features – hedges, boosters, <b>attitude</b> <b>markers,</b> and self mention – was used to investigate stance features. This part of the study was conducted in two sections. In the first part, using WordPilot 2002, these four stance features were investigated in two specialized sub-corpora of 100 qualitative and 100 quantitative research articles’ Discussion sections. The corpus analysis gave insightful information about the overall frequency as well as forms of stance features in the qualitative and quantitative sub-corpora. In the second part, in order to identify in which parts of the Discussion section each of these stance features were clustered in, these features were investigated in various moves of the Discussion sections of 10 qualitative and 10 quantitative research articles. Identifying the main moves in which each of these stance features occurred more frequently, helped to justify and account for the differences identified in the frequency of these features in 200 research articles. It also helped to identify the main function of these features based on the communicative purpose of the moves that the stance features appeared more frequently in. After the text analyses were completed, interviews were carried out with four specialist informants to supplement them. The aim of conducting these interviews was to obtain the insiders’ views on the conventions of the field and to verify the findings. Overall, the analysis revealed similarities as well as interesting differences between these two sets of articles in terms of generic structure and stance features. The differences and similarities can be attributed to the disciplinary conventions, different methodologies, and in the case of stance features to generic structure of these two sets of articles...|$|E
