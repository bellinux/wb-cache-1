25|$|At the 1980 NBA All-Star Game, league owners {{voted to}} admit the new team, with the team's name coming from the 1957–1962 TV western Maverick; the name was chosen by the fans with 4,600 postcards received, beating Wranglers and Express. James Garner, who played the namesake character, {{was a member of}} the {{ownership}} group. The University of Texas at Arlington, who also uses the Mavericks nickname, had objections about a shared name, but did not attempt any legal action. They joined the Midwest Division of the Western Conference, where they would stay until the league went to six divisions for the 2004–05 season. Dick Motta, who had guided the Washington Bullets to the NBA Championship in 1977–78, was hired as the team's first head coach. He had a well-earned reputation of being a stern disciplinarian, but was also <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>teacher</b> of the game.|$|E
25|$|Some {{insights}} on Vladimir Becić {{can be derived}} from his self-portraits, which he painted from his youngest days until just before his death. They are especially remarkable as they cover his time in Munich, then Paris and finally Osijek. Compared to the contemporary self-portraits of Joseph Racic and Miroslav Kraljevic, the Becic self-portraits are simpler, but show a full and complete expression. His early paintings, above all, show an accurate observation of form, subject and body and their spatial relationships rendered by a trained and skilful hand. The style of his later work owes something to the widespread tendency in Europe to return to nature in all things cultural and artistic after the First World War, and the influence of post-cubism - emphasizing the importance of construction. For Becić, nature was not a shelter, but an incentive, <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>teacher</b> of life, order, organization.|$|E
25|$|In the Indian {{education}} system, a teacher’s {{success is}} loosely defined. It is either {{based on a}} student’s success or based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher’s skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, {{both of which are}} often not an indicator of a good teacher. This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>teacher</b> may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, {{there is a need to}} identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.|$|E

500|$|Dhumavati {{is said to}} {{manifest}} herself {{at the time of}} cosmic dissolution (pralaya) and is [...] "the Void" [...] that exists before creation and after dissolution. While Dhumavati is generally associated with only inauspicious qualities, her thousand-name hymn relates her positive aspects as well as her negative ones. She is often called tender-hearted and a bestower of boons. Dhumavati is described as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>teacher,</b> one who reveals ultimate knowledge of the universe, which is beyond the illusory divisions, like auspicious and inauspicious. Her ugly form teaches the devotee to look beyond the superficial, to look inwards and seek the inner truths of life.|$|E
500|$|Robert went to Melun in 1142 {{to direct}} a school, but {{returned}} to Paris in 1147. He {{took part in the}} condemnation of Gilbert de la Porrée at the Council of Rheims in 1148, working with Peter Lombard to secure Porrée's recantation. A small consistory court was held after the ending of the council's deliberations, and was attended by Bernard of Clairvaux and Suger of St Denis, along with Robert and Peter. This court forced Porrée to repudiate his views on the Trinity. A fellow scholar, Herbert of Bosham, described Robert as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>teacher,</b> who [...] "sent forth from himself, like rays of his light, a great and learned host of students".|$|E

Frawley says her outer appearance as poverty is deceptive and a mere illusion that hides the inner reality. She is [...] "the good fortune that comes {{to us in the}} form of misfortune". Dhumavati embodies the [...] "power of suffering". Through the negative aspects that Dhumavati represents rise the virtues of patience, persistence, forgiveness, and detachment. Without the revealing of this negativity of life, it cannot be transcended and the secret truths would remain hidden under the smoky veil of illusion.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Faculty renewal in Engineering Technology is a {{constant}} challenge. With continuous demands placed upon faculty {{in the areas of}} teaching, scholarship, and service, administrators frequently search for ways to keep their colleagues informed. The newly formed School of Technology at Western Carolina University recently engaged in a groundbreaking activity for the institution. <b>A</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Teachers</b> Retreat (GTR) was held for all members of the school. Although there have been many successful adaptations of the original <b>great</b> <b>teacher</b> model, none has particularly dealt with engineering faculties.

50|$|A related line {{of evangelical}} {{argument}} addresses {{the notion that}} Jesus Christ was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> philosopher and ethicist, but not God. It draws on the Trilemma as postulated by C. S. Lewis and others, which argues that Jesus claimed to be God, and either this claim was true and Jesus was in fact divine, or else he was a charlatan or a madman. Assuming the trilemma to be accurate, the argument proceeds in stating that neither a charlatan or a madman could be considered <b>a</b> <b>great</b> moral <b>teacher</b> and that therefore the possibility of Jesus being merely <b>a</b> <b>great</b> moral <b>teacher</b> is excluded.|$|R
500|$|The Baltimore Orioles signed Ripken in 1957. The scout {{who signed}} {{him to his}} first minor league contract, which was for $150 a month, {{did not have a}} pen and had to borrow one from a spectator. He began his 36-year tenure in the {{organization}} as the starting catcher for the Phoenix Stars of the Class C Arizona–Mexico League. Ripken recalled, [...] "At Phoenix, my manager was Bob Hooper, who also pitched. He was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>teacher</b> and threw the best stiff-wrist slider I ever saw. Bob used so much resin that after a game when I'd congratulate him, our hands would stick together." [...] Next year, he was promoted to the Wilson Tobs of the Class B Carolina League, where he played 118 games. In 1959, he split the season between the Pensacola Dons of the Class D Alabama–Florida League and the Amarillo Gold Sox of the Texas League. Most of his playing time came in 61 games with Pensecola; he only appeared in 30 games for Amarillo.|$|E
500|$|Another early {{influence}} was William Morris. In Vaughan Williams's words, [...] "It was now that Holst discovered {{the feeling of}} unity with his fellow men which made him afterwards <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>teacher.</b> A sense of comradeship rather than political conviction led him, while still a student, to join the Kelmscott House Socialist Club in Hammersmith." [...] At Kelmscott House, Morris's home, Holst attended lectures by his host and Bernard Shaw. His own socialism was moderate in character, but he enjoyed the club for its good company and his admiration of Morris as a man. His ideals were influenced by Morris's but had a different emphasis. Morris had written, [...] "I do not want art for a few any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few. I want all persons to be educated according to their capacity, not according {{to the amount of}} money which their parents happen to have". Holst said, [...] "'Aristocracy in art'—art is not for all but only for the chosen few—but the only way to find those few is to bring art to everyone—then the artists have a sort of masonic signal by which they recognise each other in the crowd." [...] He was invited to conduct the Hammersmith Socialist Choir, teaching them madrigals by Thomas Morley, choruses by Purcell, and works by Mozart, Wagner and himself. One of his choristers was (Emily) Isobel Harrison (1876–1969), a beautiful soprano two years his junior. He fell in love with her; she was at first unimpressed by him, but she came round and they were engaged, though with no immediate prospect of marriage given Holst's tiny income.|$|E

5000|$|I {{am trying}} here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish {{thing that people}} often say about Him: 'I'm ready to accept Jesus as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> moral <b>teacher,</b> but I don't accept his claim to be God.' That {{is the one thing}} we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> moral <b>teacher.</b> He would either be a lunatic - on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg - or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or {{something}} worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being <b>a</b> <b>great</b> human <b>teacher.</b> He has not left that open to us.

2500|$|It {{remains to}} risk a brief comment: that he was and remains <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>teacher</b> [...] [...] [...] who made sense of life and of the life to come; in whose {{presence}} insuperable difficulties became less daunting; who took endless troubles {{to help those who}} brought their problems to him; someone to whom the spiritual quest in prayer was the one thing needful, who by his own life demonstrated the validity and truth of traditional teachings; and that, however emasculated by modernism, these remain the only valid criteria for those who, as he would put it, have ears to hear. His life was a celebration of “The Marriage of Wisdom and Method”: which is the title of one of his essays.|$|E

Once some monks were making noise as they were sitting in the same building as the Buddha. Maudgalyāyana then shook the building, to teach the monks to be more restrained. But the most-quoted example of Maudgalyāyana's demonstration of psychic powers is his victory over the dragon (naga) Nandopananda, which required mastery of the jhānas (states in meditation).

2500|$|Williams {{notes that}} Muir's {{philosophy}} and world view rotated around his perceived dichotomy between civilization and nature. From this developed his core belief that [...] "wild is superior". His nature writings became a [...] "synthesis of natural theology" [...] with scripture {{that helped him}} understand {{the origins of the}} natural world. According to Williams, philosophers and theologians such as Thomas Dick suggested that the [...] "best place to discover the true attributes of deity was in Nature." [...] He came to believe that God was always active in the creation of life and thereby kept the natural order of the world. As a result, Muir [...] "styled himself as a John the Baptist," [...] adds Williams, [...] "whose duty was to immerse in 'mountain baptism' everyone he could." [...] Williams concludes that Muir saw nature as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>teacher,</b> [...] "revealing the mind of God," [...] and this belief became the central theme of his later journeys and the [...] "subtext" [...] of his nature writing.|$|E
2500|$|Edward Brass had no son and Lawrence's father James {{had died}} in 1918 so a deepened {{friendship}} between the young rancher and veteran cattleman became a strong business bond. When a buyer carrying a Brass and Meyers checkbook loaded them in 1929 with 14,000 head of Texas yearlings, Brass depended on Bixby to find the rangeland. The ranch leases that Bixby negotiated and held included 10,000 acres from Emmett Green, 10,000 acres at Spring Lake, a lease from Lester Hull on the Old Overton at 30,000 acres, the 19,000 acre Coffee Ranch on Leander Creek near Merriman and 20 sections on the Old Matador Ranch west of Kyle, South Dakota near Bear Creek. Edward Brass died in 1929, leaving Meyers in full control of the Sandhills corporation. In the late 1920s with Bixby running 12,000 head of Brass and Meyers hereford cattle, 3000 head of his own hereford's and a large draft and quarter remuda the ranch prospered but during the depression of the 1930s, Meyers reduced the company's total number of cattle and Bixby's 13-year relationship with the Sandhills Corporation ended in 1937. [...] "In the fall of 1937, I turned back 6,200 head of Sugar Bowl cattle. Ed Brass was dead, E.P. Meyers and Frank Wagoner were gone and the big Brass and Meyers deal was about over. We had 3,000 cows, 25,000 acres of the Spade and all I had to wonder was could I ever pay for it. Ed Brass was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>teacher</b> and cowman.
