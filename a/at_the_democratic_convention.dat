5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Kennedy was {{substantially}} behind Humphrey in convention delegate support, but many believe that Kennedy would have ultimately secured the nomination following his victory in the California primary. Only thirteen states held primaries that year, meaning that most delegates <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>convention</b> could choose a candidate based on their personal preference. Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., and others have argued that Kennedy's broad appeal and charisma would have been sufficiently convincing at the 1968 Democratic National Convention to give him the nomination. Historian Michael Beschloss believed, however, that Kennedy would not have secured the nomination. Humphrey, after a National Convention in Chicago marred by violence in the streets, was far behind in opinion polls but gained ground. He ultimately lost the general election to Republican Richard Nixon by the narrow popular vote margin of 43.4% to 42.7%. Nixon won by a more decisive 301-191 margin in the electoral vote.|$|E

25|$|Carlisle {{became a}} leader of the {{conservative}} Bourbon Democrats and was mentioned as a presidential candidate but the Democrats passed him over at their conventions for Winfield S. Hancock in 1880 and Grover Cleveland in 1884. Discomfort with nominating a southerner after the Civil War played a role in Carlisle's failure to win either nomination. In 1892 Carlisle was again proposed as a candidate for president <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>convention,</b> but this time Carlisle asked that he not be considered. It was reported at the time that Carlisle dropped out with the understanding that Cleveland, once nominated, would appoint him to his Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} as governor, Gray {{accomplished}} very little, as {{there were only three}} months remaining in the term. Gray and Landers lost the election, and Gray attempted one last move to stay in public office. He was able to use his friends in the Senate to have his name entered as the Democratic candidate for Senator in 1881, but was defeated in the vote 8162. He then returned to his law practice, but attempted a run for governor again in 1884 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>convention.</b> By then, resistance to him had dissipated somewhat, and he won the nomination.|$|E

25|$|Four years later, Spitzer again {{wanted to}} run for Attorney General and on May 6, 1998 he {{announced}} he would run for the office for a second time. On May 28, he emerged as the front-runner among the Democratic candidates, ranking first <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>convention</b> with 36% of the vote. He also had the most amount of money, with over $2 million. In September, he won the Democratic primary election with 42% of the vote. He defeated State Senator Catherine Abate (27%), Koppell (22%), and former Governor's Counsel Evan Davis (9%). In the general election Spitzer would face the incumbent, Dennis Vacco, a Republican.|$|E
25|$|When the {{conventions}} of the Democratic and Republican parties met in June, 1916, suffragists applied pressure to both. Catt was invited to express her views {{in a speech to}} the Republican convention in Chicago. An anti-suffragist spoke after Catt, and as she was telling the convention that women did not want to vote, a crowd of suffragists burst into the hall and filled the aisles. They were soaking wet, having marched in heavy rain for several blocks in a parade led by two elephants. When the flustered anti-suffragist concluded her remarks, the suffragists led a cheer for their cause. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>convention</b> a week later in St. Louis, suffragists packed the galleries and made their views known during the debate on suffrage.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic {{nomination}} for Lieutenant Governor was a three-way battle between businessman Chris Gabrieli, state representative John P. Slattery, and former State Senator Lois Pines. Gabrieli was the running mate of Shannon O'Brien while Slattery and Pines were {{not affiliated with}} any candidate. Stephen Lynch was a candidate for Lieutenant Governor, but {{dropped out of the}} race when Congressman Joe Moakley announced he was not running for reelection and Lynch decided to run to succeed him. State Senator Cheryl A. Jacques was also a candidate for Lieutenant Governor, but dropped out of the race to run in the special election in Massachusetts's 9th congressional district.

25|$|Robert Kennedy's death {{altered the}} {{dynamics}} of the race. Although Humphrey appeared the prohibitive favorite for the nomination, thanks to his support from the traditional power blocs of the party, he was an unpopular choice with many of the anti-war elements within the party, who identified him with Johnson's controversial position on the Vietnam War. However, Kennedy's delegates failed to unite behind a single candidate who could have prevented Humphrey from getting the nomination. Some of Kennedy's support went to McCarthy, but many of Kennedy's delegates, remembering their bitter primary battles with McCarthy, refused to vote for him. Instead, these delegates rallied around the late-starting candidacy of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, a Kennedy supporter in the spring primaries who had presidential ambitions himself. This division of the anti-war votes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Convention</b> made it easier for Humphrey to gather the delegates he needed to win the nomination.|$|E
25|$|Bush's {{greatest}} area {{of strength}} {{was in the}} South, where he won most states by wide margins. He also performed {{very well in the}} Northeast, winning Maine (where he had a residence), New Hampshire (at the time a Republican stronghold), Vermont (at the time a bastion of moderate Republicanism), and Connecticut (where his father Prescott Bush had been a senator). Bush lost New York by a margin of just over 4%. He also won Delaware, a swing state at the time. Despite the presence of Lloyd Bentsen on the Democratic ticket (and other Texans getting prominent roles <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>convention),</b> Bush won Texas by 12 points. He lost the Pacific northwestern states but kept California in the Republican column for the sixth straight time, however the margin was rather narrow as he won it by 3.57% a sign of the state moving more to the left. This was, to date, the last presidential election in which a Republican candidate won California.|$|E

Calhoun's Pakenham letter, and its identification with proslavery extremism, moved the presumptive Democratic Party nominee, the northerner Martin Van Buren, into denouncing annexation. Therefore, Van Buren, already not widely popular in the South, saw his support from that region crippled. As a result, James K. Polk, a pro-Texas Jacksonian and Tennessee politician, won the nomination. Daniel Howe claims that Calhoun's Pakenham letter was a deliberate attempt to influence {{the outcome of the}} 1844 election, writing: ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the general}} {{election}} season began, Nixon focused his efforts on the [...] "big seven" [...] states: California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. He hired Roger Ailes, whom he had first encountered during an appearance on The Mike Douglas Show, to produce one hour television programs to advertise the campaign in strategic regions. The campaign also continued to use televised town hall segments throughout the campaign, which aired live, featuring real voters whom were instructed to ask tough questions, following the campaign's belief that Nixon would respond well to such questions. Starting the ground campaign tour, during his first stop in Springfield, Illinois, he discussed the importance of unity, stating that [...] "America [...] needs to be united more than any time since Lincoln." [...] He then traveled to Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania before returning to New York, meeting with Governor Rockefeller. In those Gallup polls following the convention, Nixon led Humphrey 45% to 29% and topped McCarthy 42% to 37%. At {{the end of the}} month, Hubert Humphrey narrowly won Democratic presidential nominee over McCarthy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>convention,</b> which was filled with protest and riots. Analysts saw the Democrat's split, along with lacking [...] "law and order" [...] at the convention, positioning Nixon well. Shortly before the convention and throughout {{the general election}}, Nixon received regular briefings from President Johnson on developments in the Vietnam War. The President made it clear to Nixon {{that he did not want}} the war to be politicized, to which Nixon agreed, although questioning Humphrey's eventual compliance.|$|E
