5|$|Although both Susanna and Beale {{think they}} deserve full custody, {{their desire to}} keep Maisie is {{primarily}} to spite each other, and they <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> pawn her off onto the other parent when looking after her becomes inconvenient. Maisie's time is split between staying with each of her parents, though her primary caregivers become Lincoln and Margo as Susanna leaves on a tour and Beale disappears on business trips. With his relationship with Margo disintegrating, Beale eventually decides {{to move to the}} UK.|$|E
5|$|Complex nests {{are built}} by many ant species, but other species are nomadic {{and do not}} build {{permanent}} structures. Ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees. These nests {{may be found in}} the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter, and ants carefully select their nest sites; Temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> abandon established nests {{at the first sign of}} threats.|$|E
5|$|Sharon Hawkins (Michele Morgan) – Virgil's older sister, Sharon attends college, but {{she still}} lives at home. She volunteers at a hospital, and counsels young people at the Freeman Community Center. While they do argue frequently, Sharon and Virgil really do care about each other and <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> come to the other's defense {{if one of them}} is in danger. After their mother died, Sharon took it upon herself to act as the woman of the house after, mostly when it comes to doling out chores between her and her brother and the cooking (which, at least {{according}} to Virgil, Sharon is not good at).|$|E

5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific {{angelsharks}} <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> bite if touched, captured, {{or otherwise}} provoked, and can inflict severe lacerations. Commercial fisheries for this species exist off Baja California {{and to a}} lesser extent off California (see below); the meat is considered excellent and is sold fresh or frozen. This species is captured in limited numbers by recreational fishers using hook-and-line, spears, or even by hand, particularly off southern California. It is also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls operating in the Gulf of California, and processed into fishmeal. The capacity of this species to withstand a focused fishing effort is limited, due to its low rates of reproduction and movement.|$|E
5|$|Andalusian {{horses are}} elegant and {{strongly}} built. Members of the breed have heads of medium length, {{with a straight}} or slightly convex profile. Ultra convex and concave profiles are discouraged in the breed, and are penalized in breed shows. Necks are long and broad, running to well-defined withers and a massive chest. They have a short back and broad, strong hindquarters with a well-rounded croup. The breed tends to have clean legs, with no propensity for blemishes or injuries, and energetic gaits. The mane and tail are thick and long, but the legs do not have excess feathering. Andalusians tend to be docile, while remaining intelligent and sensitive. When treated with respect they <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> learn, responsive, and cooperative.|$|E
5|$|Where spotted hyenas and lions {{occupy the}} same {{geographic}} area, {{the two species}} occupy the same ecological niche, and are thus in direct competition with one another. In some cases, the extent of dietary overlap can {{be as high as}} 68.8%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. There exists a common misconception that hyenas steal kills from lions, but most often it is the other way around. Lions will readily steal the kills of spotted hyenas; in the Ngorongoro Crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas. Lions <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> follow the calls of hyenas feeding, a fact demonstrated by field experiments, during which lions repeatedly approached whenever the tape-recorded calls of hyenas feeding were played. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 metres until the lions have finished eating. In some cases, spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force lions off a kill. This mostly occurs during the nighttime, when hyenas are bolder. Spotted hyenas usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4:1. In some instances they were seen to have taken on and routed two pride males while outnumbering them 5:1. The two species may act aggressively toward one another even when there is no food at stake. Lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason; one male lion was filmed killing two hyenas on separate occasions without eating them, and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha. Spotted hyenas have adapted to this pressure by frequently mobbing lions which enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent.|$|E

25|$|These {{strategies}} shield slums {{from the}} risk of being noticed and removed when they are small and most vulnerable to local government officials. Initial homes tend to be tents and shacks that <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> install, but as slum grows, becomes established and newcomers pay the informal association or gang for the right to live in the slum, the construction materials for the slums switches to more lasting materials such as bricks and concrete, suitable for slum's topography.|$|E
25|$|Being {{alert and}} vigilant, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog {{is a good}} watchdog. They tend to notice {{everything}} in their surroundings and <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> sound alarm. Faced with a threat, they will stand their ground {{and put on a}} show that will intimidate those unfamiliar with the dog. Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are accepting of a non-threatening stranger. They are confident and comfortable in unfamiliar locations, and are stable around strange noises and unfamiliar people. They are accepting of other dogs and species, and are reluctant to bite.|$|E
25|$|Some large parrot species, {{including}} large cockatoos, amazons, and macaws, {{have very}} long lifespans, with 80 years being reported, and record ages of over 100. Small parrots, such as lovebirds, hanging parrots, and budgies, have shorter lifespans up to 15–20 years. Some parrot species {{can be quite}} loud, {{and many of the}} larger parrots can be destructive and require a very large cage, and a regular supply of new toys, branches, or other items to chew up. The intelligence of parrots means they <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> learn tricks and other behaviours—both good and bad—that get them what they want, such as attention or treats.|$|E

25|$|Humans are {{the primary}} predators on markhor. Because markhor inhabit very steep and {{inaccessible}} mountainous habitat, several strongholds of markhor populations have been rarely approached by man. Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) have been reported preying upon young markhor. Among wild carnivores, Himalayan lynx (Felis lynx), leopard cats (Felis bengalensis), snow leopards (Panthera uncia), wolves (Canis lupus), and black bears (Ursus thibetanus) are the main predators of markhor. Because of these threats, the markhor possess keen eyesight and {{a strong sense of}} smell to detect nearby predators. Markhor are very aware of their surroundings and are on high alert for predators. In exposed areas, they <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> spot and flee from predators.|$|E
25|$|Pakistani snacks {{comprise}} {{food items}} in Pakistan that <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> prepare, spicy, usually fried, and eaten {{in the evening}} or morning with tea or with {{any one of the}} meals as a side dish. A given snack may be part of a local culture, and its preparation and popularity can vary from place to place. These snacks are often prepared and sold by hawkers on footpaths, railway stations and other such places, although they may also be served at restaurants. Some typical snacks are Dahi Bhala, Aloo tikki, chaat & Samosa Chaat, Bun kebab, Chana Masala, Chapli kebab, Shami kebab, Seekh Kebab, Malai Tikka Kebab (Meat and Yogurt), Reshami Kebab, Pakora, and Papar. Others include Katchauri, pakoras—either neem pakoras or besan (chickpea) Pakoras, Gol Gappay, Samosas—vegetable or beef, Bhail Puri, Daal Seu, Panipuri, and egg rolls. Nuts, such as pistachios and pine nuts, are also often eaten at home.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{the jacket}} of a suit, between the outer fabric {{and the inner}} lining, there is a layer of sturdy {{interfacing}} fabric to prevent the wool from stretching out of shape; this layer of cloth is called the canvas after the fabric from which it was traditionally made. Expensive jackets have a floating canvas, while cheaply manufactured models have a fused (glued) canvas. A fused canvas is less soft and, if poorly done, damages the suppleness and durability of the jacket, so many tailors <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> deride fused canvas as being less durable, particularly since they may tend to permanently pucker along the jacket's edges after some use or a few dry cleanings. However, some selling this type of jacket claim that the difference in quality is very small. A few London tailors state that all bespoke suits should use a floating canvas.|$|E

They <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> defend their nests and may react aggressively {{even to a}} shadow {{crossing}} their nest. Wheeler (1922) describes the reaction of M. nigrocincta to the disturbance of their nest as [...] "they bound out of their small mound nest {{in a series of}} short hops like Lilliputian cavalry galloping to battle." [...] The ants aggressively defend their colony, causing multiple bites and wilingly sacrificing themselves to protect the queen and the colony.|$|E
500|$|For modern readers he is {{most famous}} for the Kitab al-I'tibar and his {{descriptions}} of life in Syria during the early crusades. The disjointed {{nature of the work}} has given him a reputation as a senile rambler, although it is actually written with an anthological structure, with humorous or moralistic tales that are not meant to proceed chronologically, as a true autobiography would. Since this style of literature, adab in Arabic, does not necessarily have to be factual, historians <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> point out that Usama's historical material cannot always be trusted. Usama's anecdotes about the crusades are sometimes obvious jokes, exaggerating their [...] "otherness" [...] to entertain his Muslim audience.

500|$|During {{the final}} struggle, which pits the patriarchal social {{structure}} of the Xeno team against Sandy's maternal element, it is not until Gary has half-suffocated in the toxic atmosphere that he is murdered. Wright argues that the sequence is reassuring from a male perspective despite its graphic content, since it implies that no woman, even one with superhuman strength, possesses the power to kill a man in cold blood. A murderer of colleagues of both sexes, that Sandy dies {{at the hands of}} Mark ultimately renders her an aid to the re-empowerment of the male sex, although the twin offspring <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> avenge her.
