5|$|Almost 100 {{people were}} {{beheaded}} in Halifax {{between the first}} recorded execution in 1286 and the last in 1650, but as {{the date of the}} gibbet's installation is uncertain, it cannot be determined with any accuracy how many were dealt with by the Halifax Gibbet.

The stone base was rediscovered <b>and</b> <b>preserved</b> in about 1840, and a non-working replica was erected on the site in 1974.

5|$|Bordering to {{the north}} of Blue Spring State Park is Hontoon Island State Park, {{accessible}} only by boat. In 1955 an extremely rare Timucua totem representing an owl was found buried <b>and</b> <b>preserved</b> in the St. Johns muck off of Hontoon Island. The figure may signify that its creators were part of the owl clan. Representing different clans of the Timucua, two more totems—in all, the only totems in North America to have been found outside of the Pacific Northwest—shaped like a pelican and otter were found in 1978 after being snagged by a barge {{at the bottom of the}} river. River otters (Lutra canadensis) can be found through the length of the St. Johns and its tributaries, living in burrows or in the roots of trees bordering waterways. They eat crayfish, turtles, and small fish, and are active usually at night, playful but shy of human contact.|$|E
