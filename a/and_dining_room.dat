The sanctuary floor was wood, with wood wainscoting and plaster walls.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the female}} {{claim to the}} {{principal}} rooms of the corps de logis, the library <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> were relocated to a secondary wing not built until much later. This secondary wing {{is linked to the}} west of corps de logis by a large arcaded loggia; originally open, it is now glazed and known as the Winter Garden. A later secondary wing, known as the Shuvalov wing (named after Vorontsov's son-in-law, Count Shuvalov) was not part of Blore's original plan and designed by his assistant, William Hunt.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1940, Governor-General Hans Frank {{issued a}} decree {{requiring}} all Kraków Jews {{to leave the}} city within the next two weeks. Only those who had jobs directly related to the German war effort would be allowed to stay. Of the 60,000 to 80,000 Jews then living in the city, only 15,000 remained by March 1941. These Jews were then forced to leave their traditional neighbourhood of Kazimierz and relocate to the walled Kraków Ghetto, established in the industrial Podgórze district. Schindler's workers travelled on foot to and from the ghetto each day to their jobs at the factory. Enlargements to the facility in the four years Schindler was in charge included the addition of an outpatient clinic, co-op, kitchen, <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> for the workers, in addition to expansion of the factory and its related office space.|$|E

More elaborate versions may include dishwashers, refrigerators, or sinks.|$|R
5|$|The Briarcliff Lodge was {{a luxury}} {{resort in the}} village of Briarcliff Manor, New York. It was a notable example of Tudor Revival architecture, {{and was one of the}} largest wooden {{structures}} in the United States. It was also the first hotel in Westchester County. Walter William Law had it built on his estate, and the Law family owned it until 1937. When the lodge opened in 1902, it was one of the largest resort hotels in the world. The lodge hosted presidents, royalty, and celebrities, and was the scene of numerous memorable occasions for visitors and local residents who attended weddings, receptions, and dances in the ballroom <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> For a long time, the lodge was situated among other businesses of Walter Law, including the Briarcliff Farms and Briarcliff Table Water Company.|$|E
5|$|The new wing has six dormers (three on a side), and six dormers {{were added}} to the old house in the 1913 {{renovation}} (four on the east side, two on the west). The windows {{on the first floor of}} the new wing matched the old windows, but the windows in the second story of the addition have twelve panes in the upper sash and eight in the lower. As part of the renovation work, four new windows were placed in the 1850s house: two just west of the new wing, and two on the east wall of the lower part of the L. A small porch was added in the corner where the west wall of the new wing meets the north wall of the old house, and all the old porches were restored. In the original house two chimneys were restored and two replaced, and new fireplaces were installed in the living room, library, <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> The house has a total of 28 rooms.|$|E
5|$|Under Abbot Edward Knowle (1306–1332), a major {{rebuilding}} of the Abbey church began despite financial problems. Between 1298 and 1332 {{the eastern part}} of the abbey church was rebuilt in the English Decorated Gothic style. He also rebuilt the cloisters, the canons' dining room, the King's Hall and the King's Chamber. The Black Death is likely to have affected the monastery and when William Coke became abbot in 1353 he obtained a papal bull from Pope Urban V to allow him ordain priests at a younger age to replace those who had died. Soon after the election of his successor, Henry Shellingford, in 1365 Edward III took control of the monsatery and made The 4th Baron Berkeley its commissioner to resolve the financial problems. In the late 14th and early 15th centuries Abbots Cernay and Daubeney restored the fortunes of the order, partly by obtaining the perpetual vicarage of several local parishes. These difficulties meant that little building work had been undertaken for nearly 100 years. However, in the mid-15th century, the number of Canons increased and the transept and central tower were constructed. Abbot John Newland, (1481–1515), also known as 'Nailheart' due to his rebus of a heart pierced by three nails, began the {{rebuilding of}} the nave, but it was incomplete at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539. Newland also rebuilt the cloisters, the upper part of the Gatehouse, the canons' dormitory <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> and the Prior's Lodging (parts of which remained until 1884 as they were built into Minster House).|$|E

50|$|As {{with all}} Prairie houses, Wright {{designed}} the light fixtures for the Robie House. Throughout the house, wall sconces {{can be found}} in the shape of a hemispherical shade suspended beneath a square bronze fixture. On the second floor living <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> <b>rooms,</b> spherical globes within wooden squares are integrated into the ceiling trim, further tying the two spaces together visually. Soffit lighting running the length of the north and south sides of the living <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> <b>rooms,</b> as well as soffit lighting in the prows of the living <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> <b>rooms,</b> are covered with Wright-designed wooden grilles, backed with translucent colored glass diffusers. Because these lights are all independently operable, different effects can be created within these spaces. Finally, a Wright-designed table lamp with an art glass shade stood on a Wright-designed library table in the living room.|$|R
