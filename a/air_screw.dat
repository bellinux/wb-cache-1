Recently new algebraic method was formulated to generate numerical grids for CFD calculation of twin screw machines with grids generated from outer casing boundaries [16, 18]. In this paper, the grids of Rotor to Casing and Casing to Rotor type are tested for performance calculation of a dry <b>air</b> <b>screw</b> compressor using ANSYS CFX solver and {{the results have been}} compared with measurements. Firstly the base-line grid of the Rotor to Casing grid type was used to obtain CFD results. A grid independent solution was obtained for this base-line grid. The size of the mesh thus obtained has been used with other grid variants for comparison. A set of successively refined Casing to Rotor grid type was tested by increasing the density of nodes on the rotor profile in the interlobe leakage region. A gradual improvement in the accuracy of flow prediction was achieved with successive refinement in the interlobe region. The third variant used for comparison is a Casing to Rotor grid type with a single rotor domain that has no interface between the rotor blocks. A significant improvement in the prediction of flow and internal pressure was achieved. These developments have also extended the capability of the deforming grids to be used with other CFD solvers like STAR-CCM+ and ANSYS FLUENT.

40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers {{insight into}} screw {{compressor}} designs beyond {{the capabilities of}} other conventional methods. It allows evaluation of local flow patterns which influence performance but are difficult or impossible to investigate experimentally. Implementation of CFD in these machines is challenging due to the physics of the flow, {{the properties of the}} working fluids and the complexity of flow passages which change size and position. This is additionally challenged by a lack of methodologies available to generate the meshes required for the full three dimensional transient simulations. Commercially available CFD solvers need to fully interact with customized grid generators to enable resolution of grid deformation during a flow solution. However, the factors that influence flow predictions are not only related to grids but also to the approach which CFD solvers use to calculate distribution of parameters such as pressure, velocities, temperatures, etc. In this paper, two approaches most commonly used in commercial CFD software are compared and analysed. The first is a segregated cell-centre based solver and the second is a coupled vertex-centre based solver. Both are pressure based finite volume solvers. Customized grid generation software is used for meshing of moving rotors and flow domains around the rotors in an oil free <b>air</b> <b>screw</b> compressor with ‘N’ rotor profile of 3 / 5 lobe combination. The deforming rotor grid is maintained as identical in both solvers. The performance predictions obtained by calculations with these two CFD models are compared with measurements obtained on the test compressor in the City University London test rig. The comparison includes pressure in the compressor chamber, mass flow rate, indicated power and the volumetric efficiency. The study reveals differences between the results obtained by two different solvers and the experimental results. Analysis presented in this paper provides a good basis for further consideration of differencing schemes and other characteristics and settings for different CFD solvers in order to achieve accurate predictions of flows in positive displacement machines...|$|E

Hasty growth of screw compressor field and variety of their constructions enables this wide use. A screw type compressor is one of the simplest mechanisms, which uses for production of the compressed <b>air.</b> <b>Screw</b> compressor is rotary positive displacement machine, which is compact and have few moving parts, and which operate at high efficiency over a wide range of speeds and pressure differences.

The rotors of screw type compressors are the most important details, which makes influence on running efficiency. Threadbare of rotors and change of material properties diminishes efficiency of action of compressor, and their lifetime. The task of this work is analysis and solutions for these problems.

Under load/unload conditions, to change the offline pressure with step of 0. 01 MPa, the power consumption floats {{up and down with}} the change of unloading and loading and then the screw compressor power consumption is simulated in MATLAB. The results shows that the optimal offline pressure exists at the given air consumption and meanwhile power consumption is minimal with the optimal offline pressure. It also reveals that the required optimal offline pressures will vary by air consumptions. Then, based on dynamic mechanical analysis for fluid motion in the pipe, considering that there is a causal relationship between pressure variation and gas flow variation, a method for measuring flow rate of one dimensional unsteady flow dynamically is proposed based on theory of linear approximation.
