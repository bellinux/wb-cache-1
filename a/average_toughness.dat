50|$|The {{cold-work}} {{tool steels}} include the O-series (oil-hardening), the A-series (air-hardening), and the D-series (high carbon-chromium). These are steels used to cut or form {{materials that are}} at low temperatures. This group possesses high hardenability and wear resistance, and <b>average</b> <b>toughness</b> and heat softening resistance. They are used in production of larger parts or parts that require minimal distortion during hardening. The use of oil quenching and air-hardening helps reduce distortion, avoiding the higher stresses caused by the quicker water quenching. More alloying elements are used in these steels, {{as compared to the}} water-hardening class. These alloys increase the steels' hardenability, and thus require a less severe quenching process and as a result are less likely to crack. They have high surface hardness and are often used to make knife blades. The machinability of the oil hardening grades is high but for the high carbon-chromium types is low.|$|E

The optimization technique by Cantor (1990) is employed which involves the identification of key process variables including screw speed, nip speed, bubble diameter, and frost-line height for analysis to optimize the merit function. The procedure is employed in the extrusion of a low-density polyethylene polymer, and the resulting optimized materials are toughness- and puncture-tested. Balloon toughness is optimized in the analytical relationship, and the process parameters are modified to attain optimal toughness.

40|$|AbstractThe {{significant}} petroleum {{reserve in}} the Arctic drives {{the need for}} offshore facilities in the Arctic made of ferritic structural steels. Such steel materials often exhibit a brittle fracture mode without noticeable prior plastic deformations. This paper presents a combined experimental and numerical investigation to assess the cleavage fracture failure for high-strength steels used in offshore applications. The experimental program includes a set of non-conventional, special single-edge notched bend, SSE(B) specimens, tested under a lower ambient temperature of - 90 °C. In contrast to the conventional through-thickness fracture specimens, which experience an approximately uniform crack driving force along the entire crack front, the specimens with a curved crack front indicates strong variations in both the crack driving forces and constraints along the crack front. This study therefore utilizes an <b>average</b> <b>toughness</b> value calculated from the η-approach to describe the scatter observed in the fracture toughness. This study also presents a numerical investigation using the local Weibull stress approach to estimate the probability of cleavage fracture in the fracture tests. A combination of the fracture initiation zone defined by the J-integral values with a local Weibull stress driving force predicts reasonably well the probability of fracture of the experimental specimens...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was the {{determination}} of fracture toughness of the presintered zirconia ceramic DC-Shrink using the indenter technique, along with a critical evaluation of this method for the determination of this important parameter of zirconia used for dental restaurations. The theoretical part {{of this study}} is an overview of destructive and non- destructive testing methods, which can or can't be used on dental ceramics. The actual testing was performed on 54 specimen bars. They were devided in 3 groups with 18 bars each group in 1, 5 mm, 2 mm, 2, 5 mm. They were sintered after manufacturer's instructions, 3 specimens of one hight at 1350 °C, 1400 °C, 1480 °C, 1500 °C, 1530 °C and 1580 °C. Afterwards threepoint- bending toughness was determined, elastic modulus was calculated and finally Vicker's hardness indents were made and measured with a light microscpe. The resulting parameters were used to calculate the fracture toughness. Additionally the specimen bars were thermal- etched in order to analyse the microstructure. The <b>average</b> <b>toughness</b> was 914 MPa with an ideal sintering temperature of 1480 °C. The average elastic modulus was calculated with 187. 738 MPa without any significant differences in sintering temperatures, but with an influence of the specimenhights. Fracture toughness was determined with 3, 43 MPa*√m in average and was significantly lower then expected from literature reseach (7 - 10 MPa*√m). Furthermore it showed that fracture toughness variies concerning sintering temperature and specimenhights. The results determined in this study lead to the conclusion, that DC-Shrink can be used for the indication given by the manufacturer. The results of this study for elastic modulus show that for presintered zirconia a steady elastic modulus of 210 GPa must not be expected. The dependence between sintering temperature and grain- size could not be doubtlessly proven, but a correlation between temperature, grain- size and material parameters was detectable...|$|E
40|$|Conventional heating methods offer limited {{opportunities}} in cycle time reduction {{due to the}} low thermal conductivity of polymer matrices. Microwaves can offer advantages in this sense, however past limitations in hardware, software and lack of suitable operating procedures led to inconsistent results and conclusions. In the present study 2. 4 mm, 4. 8 mm and 60 mm thick out-of-autoclave unidirectional carbon-epoxy composites were cured using a homogeneous microwave system at 2. 45 GHz. A methodology to measure the microwave penetration depth, and to cure carbon fibre reinforced polymer composites without arcing (thus producing reliable and consistent results) were proposed. The results of the curing methodology adopted was demonstrated by measuring the degree of crosslink, axial and transverse tension, axial compression, in-plane shear, indentation, mode I interlaminar fracture and fibre push-out testing. With a suitable microwave cure cycle, the axial tensile performance was similar to those cured using a conventional process. The transverse tensile and in-plane shear strength of microwave-cured samples were lower than those produced using conventional means. In axial compression tests, the microwavecured samples exhibited {{a significant increase in}} strength. In interlaminar fracture testing, conventional oven-cured samples showed lower fracture toughness values with little variation with crack propagation, whereas the microwave-cured samples showed an increasing trend with crack propagation, and a greater <b>average</b> <b>toughness</b> value. The fibre-matrix interfacial shear strength was also greater in the microwave-cured samples. The increase in fibre-matrix interfacial shear strength was proportional to the increase in the interlaminar fracture toughness. The changes in properties were due to a change at the microscopic level of the matrix, where the preferential microwave heating of the carbon fibres produced a microstructure where the epoxy closest to the fibres reached a higher degree of cure compared {{with the rest of the}} matrix, as well as an increased fibre-matrix interfacial bond. Away from the fibre the matrix was more rubbery, thus producing a multi-phase brittle-ductile region. The contribution to knowledge in the thesis was the conclusion of pragmatic studies, which now permits the manufacture of unidirectional composites cured using microwaves without the damage and inconsistencies that occurred using previous methodologies.

Alloy UNS S 31803 (EN 1. 4462 /UNS S 32205) combines high strength with good resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion. This grade is alloyed with nitrogen and has good weldability. For heavy-walled process piping intended for subsea sour service, the properties of the root pass are of high importance.

Fracture mechanical characterization was based on the three-point bending test which enables stable crack propagation to take place in small rectangular pieces of wheat endosperm. The crack length can be measured in situ by using an optical microscope with light illumination from the side of the specimen or from the back of the specimen. Two new techniques were developed and used to estimate {{the fracture}} toughness of wheat endosperm, a geometric approach and a compliance method. The geometric approach gave <b>average</b> fracture <b>toughness</b> values of 53. 10 and 27. 0 J m(- 2) for hard and soft endosperm, respectively. Fracture toughness estimated using the compliance method gave values of 49. 9 and 29. 7 J m(- 2) for hard and soft endosperm, respectively. Compressive properties of the endosperm in three mutually perpendicular axes revealed that the hard and soft endosperms are isotropic composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of the fracture surfaces and the energy-time curves of loading-unloading cycles revealed that there was a plastic flow during crack propagation for both the hard and soft endosperms, and confirmed that the fracture mode is significantly related to the adhesion level between starch granules and the protein matrix...|$|R

The three morphologies were a dispersion of spherulites, a structureless gel and a gel with spherulites. The <b>average</b> fracture <b>toughnesses,</b> K Ic, and fracture energies, G Ic, for those morphologies were 0. 83, 2. 3 and 1. 8 MPa m 1 / 2 and 240, 2000 and 1150 J m − 2, respectively.

The elastic moduli and yield strengths in compression for all three blend morphologies remained essentially unchanged from those of the cured epoxy without PBT, namely, 2. 9 GPa for the modulus and 115 MPa for the yield strength. The fracture surfaces of the cured spherulitic dispersion blends indicate the absorption of fracture energy by crack bifurcation induced by the spherulites. The fracture surfaces of the cured structureless gel blends indicate that fracture energy was absorbed by matrix and PBT plastic deformation and by spontaneous crack bifurcation. But phase transformation of the PBT and anelastic strain of the matrix below the fracture surfaces may account for most of the large fracture energy of the cured structureless gel blends...|$|R

Spheroidized microstructures are formed by proeutectoid and eutectoid carbide particles embedded in a ferrite matrix. The mean proeutectoid carbide particle size {{is larger than the}} mean eutectoid carbide particle size and is practically invariable with austenitizing temperature below 850 °C. Pearlitic microstructures exhibit prior austenite grain sizes and pearlite colony sizes which increase and interlamellar spacings which decrease as the austenitizing temperature increases above 850 °C. A proeutectoid carbide size distribution that remains basically constant with austenitizing temperature is also observed in these microstructures. Plane-strain fracture toughness of spheroidized and pearlitic UHCS- 1. 5 C materials do not vary significantly with austenitizing temperature, being the <b>average</b> fracture <b>toughness</b> of about 40 MPa m 1 / 2 and 30 MPa m 1 / 2, respectively. The constancy of fracture toughness with austenitizing temperature of the spheroidized microstructures is attributed to the constancy of the mean proeutectoid and eutectoid carbide size. Austenite grain size, pearlite colony size, interlamellar spacing and undissolved proeutectoid carbide size are evaluated for the influence of fracture toughness associated with pearlitic microstructures. It is found that proeutectoid carbide is the microstructural parameter that controls fracture toughness of pearlitic microstructures.

40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness of three new compositional variants of the Zr-Ti-Be-LTM (Late Transition Metal) family of bulk metallic glasses (BMG’s) are {{studied in the}} as-cast and annealed condition. Quaternary Zr-Ti-Cu-Be alloys consistently had linear elastic {{fracture toughness}} values greater than 80 MPa∙m 1 / 2, while Vitreloy 1, a Zr-Ti-Cu-Ni-Be alloy, had an <b>average</b> fracture <b>toughness</b> of 48. 5 MPa∙m 1 / 2 with {{a large amount of}} scatter. The addition of iron to Vitreloy 1 reduced the fracture toughness to 25 MPa∙m 1 / 2. The Zr-Ti-Cu-Be alloy, having fracture toughness K_Q = 85 MPa∙m 1 / 2 as cast, was annealed at various time/temperature combinations. When the alloy was annealed 50 C below Tg, the fracture toughness dropped to 6 MPa∙m 1 / 2, while DSC and X-ray showed the alloy to still be amorphous. Fracture surfaces were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. The tougher samples have shown evidence of highly jagged patterns at the beginning stage of crack propagation, and the length scale and roughness of this jagged pattern correlate well with the measured fracture toughness values. These jagged patterns, the main source of energy dissipation in the sample, are attributed to the formation of shear bands inside the sample. This observation provides a strong evidence of significant “plastic zone” screening at the crack tip. Unlike the unstable fracture behavior of monolithic BMG’s, ductile phase containing in-situ BMG composite shows stable crack growth behavior. Application of ductile BMG as a matrix for an in-situ composite with controlled microstructural characteristic length scales maximizes the toughening effect. In order to characterize this highly toughened BMG composite, the elastic-plastic fracture mechanics concept is introduced and the J-parameter is evaluated. A novel thermoplastic bonding concept is demonstrated based on the unique rheological behavior and pattern-replication ability of bulk metallic glass forming liquids. In this approach, the bulk metallic glass is heated above Tg to the “supercooled liquid” region while a small normal force is applied to the joint. This results in liquid reflow, wetting and a strong bond. Complete wetting between copper substrates and a layer of platinum based bulk metallic glass leads to an atomistically intimate void-free interface. ...|$|R

However, the <b>average</b> propagation fracture <b>toughness</b> GIC-PROP was 783 J/m 2 for the Quickstep specimens, which was 2. 6 times of that for the autoclave specimens. The mechanism of fracture occurred during delamination was studied under scanning electron microscope (SEM). Three types of fracture were observed: the interlayer fracture, the interface fracture, and the intralaminar fracture. These three types of fracture played different roles in affecting the delamination resistance curves during the crack growth. More fiber bridging {{was found in the}} process of delamination for the Quickstep specimens. Better fiber/matrix adhesion was found in the Quickstep specimens by conducting indentation-debond tests...|$|R

Experience has shown that sometimes these particles fail in operation. The fracture toughness (KIC) was measured at room temperature to determine the maximum internal pressure that the CVD SiC layer in TRISO-coated fuel particles can withstand without fracturing. The KIC was measured using the indentation fracture toughness method on the curved-surface and cross-section of the test piece. The most suitable test load for measuring the KIC and Vickers hardness (HV) values of the CVD SiC layer was 100 g. The Evans-Davis model for calculating the KIC of ceramic materials was found to be the most appropriate for the CVD SiC layer. The average curved-surface KIC value was 3. 47 MPa. √m, for the 51 mm test sample, which was tougher than the average cross-section KIC value of 3. 17 MPa. √m. The wall thickness values of the samples tested were 28, 36, 39 and 51 mm and their corresponding measured mean curved-surface KIC values were 3. 13, 3. 07, 3. 15 and 3. 47 MPa. √m, respectively, which were on par with values reported in literature. The corresponding minimum curved-surface KIC values were 1. 43, 1. 67, 1. 65 and 2. 52 MPa. √m, respectively. These values were obtained from the average curved-surface KIC values minus five sigma (KIC = μ- 5 σ). The internal pressure that the SiC shell can handle without failing will depend on the initial crack length and the value of KIC. The pressure that a particle can withstand assuming the leak-before-break (i. e. a particle with a crack that extends right through the shell) was also used. This represents a more conservative value for the maximum pressure allowable without fracture when the fracture toughness is known. In fact, there is a considerable wide distribution in the measured fracture <b>toughness.</b> Using the <b>average</b> fracture <b>toughness</b> (μ) minus five times the standard deviation (σ) represents a conservative approach. The calculated maximum allowable pressure represents an even more conservative approach when both the LBB condition and the μ- 5 σ requirement are assumed. This is probably representative for the operation of the PBMR. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015. tm 2015 Materials Science and Metallurgical EngineeringMScUnrestricte...|$|R

The effect of preheating temperature on the mechanical and fracture behavior, hardness, and the microstructure of slot welded pearlitic rail steel were studied. Railhead sections with slots were preheated to 200 ˚C, 300 ˚C, 350 ˚C and 400 ˚C before gas metal arc filling to simulate defects repair. Another sample, welded at room temperature (RT) with no pre-heat, was studied in comparison. The parent rail steel has ultimate strength, yield strength and strain to failure of 1146 MPa, 717 MPa and 9. 3 %, respectively. Optimum values of these properties for the welded rail steels {{were found to be}} 1023 MPa, 655 MPa and 4. 7 %, respectively, for the 200 ˚C preheat temperature. On this basis, the optimum weld effi-ciency was found to be 89. 2 %. The <b>average</b> apparent fracture <b>toughness</b> KI for the parent rail was 127 MPa. m 0. 5, while that for the optimum welded joint (200 ˚C preheat) was 116. 5 MPa. m 0. 5. In addition, the average hardness values of the weld, fusion zone, and heat affected zone (HAZ) were 313. 5, 332 and 313. 6 HB, respectively, while that for parent rail steel was about 360 HB.

40|$|Using {{experimentally}} measured temperature-process-dependent model parameters, {{the failure}} analysis and life prediction were conducted for Atmospheric Plasma Sprayed Thermal Barrier Coatings (APS-TBCs) and electron beam {{physical vapor deposition}} thermal barrier coatings (EB-PVD TBCs) with Pt-modified -NiAl bond coats deposited on Ni-base single crystal superalloys. For APS-TBC system, a residual stress model for the top coat of APS-TBC was proposed and then applied to life prediction. The capability of the life model was demonstrated using temperature-dependent model parameters. Using existing life data, a comparison of fitting approaches of life model parameters was performed. The role of the residual stresses distributed at each individual coating layer was explored and their interplay on the coating’s delamination was analyzed. For EB-PVD TBCs, based on failure mechanism analysis, two newly analytical stress models from the valley position of top coat and ridge of bond coat were proposed describing stress levels generated as consequence of the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) mismatch between each layers. The thermal stress within TGO was evaluated based on composite material theory, where effective parameters were calculated. The lifetime prediction of EB-PVD TBCs was conducted given that the failure analysis and life model were applied to two failure modes A and B identified experimentally for thermal cyclic process. The global wavelength related to interface rumpling and its radius curvature were identified as essential parameters in life evaluation, and the life results for failure mode A were verified by existing burner rig test data. For failure mode B, the crack growth rate along the topcoat/TGO interface was calculated using the experimentally measured <b>average</b> interfacial fracture <b>toughness...</b>|$|R
40|$|Pipelines are an {{essential}} part of the oil and gas offshore industry, for transporting unprocessed oil and gas from the seabed to the oil platform and to the mainland. The unprocessed oil and gas leaves a corrosive environment, which sets a demand for pipes with a corrosion resistant interior. Clad pipes meet this demand with a corrosion resistant, stainless steel interior and an outer carbon steel layer. There is of today no repair contingency for clad pipes. A knowledge basis needs to be established and the risk of hydrogen induced stress cracking (HISC) must be found. This thesis work has been divided into two parts; One part working on experimentally testing of the triple point in welded clad pipes. Focused on fracture resistance curves, fracture toughness and crack path, with and without hydrogen present. The second part was focused on modelling a FE-model that was able to simulate crack propagation in clad pipe interface samples, experimentally tested by Jemblie. Both with and without hydrogen present during testing. Fracture mechanical testing of welded clad pipe C(T) samples have been successfully conducted, in air and under cathodic protection (CP). The samples with Ni-interlayer showed almost no reduction in fracture toughness from tests in air to tests under CP, with an <b>average</b> fracture <b>toughness</b> reduction of 0. 13 %. The small fracture toughness reduction may be explained by the crack path going into the Ni-interlayer which is not much susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The samples without Ni-interlayer experienced a high decrease in fracture toughness tested under CP, with an average reduction in fracture toughness equal to 92 %. The crack path in the samples without Ni-interlayer was examined in a light optical microscope (LOM). The test done in air showed a crack path shifting between the base material and the clad. The crack propagated mainly in the clad in the sample tested under CP. Not enough samples were tested to establish the fracture resistance curves for the samples without Ni-interlayer. A 2 D FE-model with cohesive zone elements was successfully modelled. The FE-model was able to simulate crack propagation along the crack ligament, in a C(T) specimen, both with linear elastic and elastic-plastic materials. The FE-model was however not able to simulate the crack propagation observed in experimentally testing by Jemblie. This was not possible due to numerical problems occurring after a few cohesive elements had failed, when using sufficiently high cohesive element parameter values. For further work should more tests in both air and under CP be done on welded samples, with and without a Ni-interlayer. To establish the fracture resistance curves for both sample types. The microstructure on the samples without Ni-interlayer needs to be checked, to be sure that the samples are representative for welded clad pipes. The fractography must be studied and the cross section on multiply samples must be examined, on the samples without Ni-interlayer. To establish a more solid basis to explain the crack path and the hydrogen susceptibility on welded clad pipes. A deep root-cause investigation should be done on the FE-simulation, to explain and come up with a possible solution on the numerical crack propagation problem...|$|R

The rate sensitivities of mode-I and mode-II {{fracture}} toughness, in {{the form}} of GIc and GIIc of Toray T 800 S/ 3900 carbon unitape/epoxy, T 700 G/ 3900 Plain weave carbon fabric/epoxy, and Newport NB 321 / 7781 fiberglass/epoxy materials were investigated experimentally. Static and dynamic tests, with stroke rates ranging from 8. 33 × 10 - 4 in/s to 100 in/s, were conducted on double cantilever beam and end notch flexure specimens. Both [0 °] N and [± 45 °] N laminates were studied in this investigation. The rate sensitivities were characterized in terms of the initiation fracture toughness and crack growth resistance. The average mode-I initiation fracture toughness, GIc of NB 321 / 7781 [0 °] laminate was observed to decrease with stroke rate from 6. 5 lbf-in/in 2 to 4 lbf-in/in 2 and further increased to 6 lbf-in/in 2 over a range of 5 decades of crack opening displacement rates. The resistance tended to be constant with crack length for the low rate tests. At higher rates, the resistance decreased gradually. The tests data indicated ductile stable and brittle unstable behavior with a transition stick-slip behavior. The <b>average</b> mode-II fracture <b>toughness</b> of the NB 321 / 7781 [0 °] laminate was observed to increase from 12 lbf-in/in 2 to 17 lbf-in/in 2 over the entire range of 5 decades of shear displacement rates. The fracture behavior was observed to be brittle stable at all rates. The NB 321 / 7781 [± 45 °] laminate’s opening mode initiation toughness was observed to decrease from 9 lbf-in/in 2 to 3 lbf-in/in 2 and further increased to 4 lbf-in/in 2 over a range of 5 decades of crack opening displacement rates. The delamination resistance increased with crack length for the low rate tests. At higher rates, the resistance decreased gradually. The fracture behavior transitioned from ductile stable to brittle unstable. The opening mode initiation toughness of T 700 G/ 3900 [0 °] laminate decreased from 3. 5 lbf-in/in 2 to 2 lbf-in/in 2 and further increased to 3. 2 lbf-in/in 2 over a range of 5 decades of viii crack opening displacement rates. The delamination resistance indicated constant pattern irrespective of the stroke rates. The fracture behavior at low rates indicated transition stick-slip behavior, whereas brittle unstable behavior was evident at higher rates. The mode-II fracture toughness tended to be constant at 4. 5 lbf-in/in 2 over a range of 5 decades of shear displacement rates. Brittle stable fracture behavior was observed at all rates. The opening mode initiation toughness of T 700 G/ 3900 [± 45 °] laminate was observed to decrease from 2. 75 lbf-in/in 2 to 1. 8 lbf-in/in 2 and further increased to 2. 8 lbf-in/in 2 over a range of 5 decades of crack opening displacement rates. The delamination resistance tended to increase with crack length at lower rates, whereas it tended to decrease at higher rates. The fracture behavior indicated transition stick-slip behavior at lower rates, whereas brittle unstable behavior was evident at the highest rate tested. The T 800 S/ 3900 [0 °] laminate’s opening mode initiation toughness was observed to steadily decrease from 5 lbf-in/in 2 to 2. 5 lbf-in/in 2 over a range of 5 decades of crack opening displacement rates. The delamination resistance was observed to increase with crack length at lower rates, whereas it tended to decrease gradually at higher rates. Brittle stable fracture behavior was observed at all rates. Fiber bridging was prominent with an increase in test rates. The mode-II fracture toughness increased steadily from 9 lbf-in/in 2 to 20 lbf-in/in 2 over a range of 5 decades of shear displacement rates.
