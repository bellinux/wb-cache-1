50|$|Eight 0.5-in. (1.27-cm) {{diameter}} irradiation {{positions are}} located in the semipermanent reflector. The semipermanent reflector is made up of eight separate pieces of beryllium, four of which are referred to as control-rod access plugs. Each control-rod <b>access</b> <b>plug</b> contains two unlined irradiation facilities, designated CR-1 through CR-8. Each of these facilities accommodates an experiment capsule similar to those used in the small removable beryllium facilities. The vertical centerlines of all control-rod <b>access</b> <b>plug</b> irradiation facilities are located 12.68 in. (32.2 cm) from the vertical centerline of the reactor. Only non-instrumented experiments can be irradiated in these facilities. When not in use, these facilities contain beryllium plugs. A pressure drop of 10 psi (6.89 x 104 Pa) at full system flow is available to provide primary system coolant flow for cooling experiments.|$|E
40|$|Two MCNP models ({{detailed}} and approximated) of University of Maryland Training Reactor were created. The detailed model {{attempted to}} simulate the reactor according to engineering specifications while the simplified model eliminated all structural materials {{above and below the}} core. Neutron flux spectrum calculations for both models within the core showed that the results obtained from both models agreed within less than 0. 5 %. It was concluded that reactors equipped with standard TRIGA fuels enriched to 20 percent in uranium- 235 can be modeled with all structures above and below the core eliminated entirely from the model without increasing the error due to geometry modeling simplifications of the core. In TRIGA reactors supplied with standard TRIGA fuels enriched to 20 percent in U- 235, the graphite reflectors above and below the fuel act as "neutron energy regulators. " Neutrons reflected back into the core through the graphite reflectors quickly become thermalized even if their energies were altered due to the change in materials properties above and below the core. Both MCNP models results agree well with measured data. It was also found that simplification in the target geometry leads to substantial uncertainty in the calculated results. The neutron energy spectrum, thermal flux, and total flux were calculated at the thermal column <b>access</b> <b>plug</b> face; in the pneumatic transfer system rabbit, and on top and bottom sections of the most center fuel element. The thermal flux and the total flux at the thermal column <b>access</b> <b>plug</b> face both agreed with measured data within a 5 % uncertainty. The thermal flux, fast flux, and the total flux in the rabbit differ by 18. 8 %, 35 %, and 5. 7 % respectively, from the measured data. The relatively high uncertainty (in the neutron energy distribution but not the total neutron flux) was attributed to the use of air as the target irradiated inside the rabbit. For such a thin target (15 mg/cm 2), a precise neutron balance between reflection and absorption events is difficult to obtain; that will alter the thermal or fast flux values. The contribution of this work to the reactor users is that a virtual reactor model that compared well with experiment is created. Experiments utilizing the reactor experimental facilities (thermal column, through tube, pneumatic transfer system rabbit, and beam ports) can now be optimized before they are executed. The contribution of this work to the research reactor community at is that research reactors equipped with standard TRIGA fuels can be modeled with core geometry approximations, such as these adopted in this work, without affecting the precision and accuracy of the Monte Carlo calculations...|$|E

A chem-milled outer skin, an {{improved}} thermoelectric element adjustment and <b>access</b> <b>plug,</b> a flexible stainless steel-aluminum joint welded via ultrasoric techniques, a flexible hot shoe assembly, and thermal hydrauilc heat dump system {{were incorporated into}} {{the design of the}} environmental and ground test generators. Materials Analysis. Burnup studies on fuel forms were continued with CeF/sub 3 / and CeO/sub 2 /. SiC/sub 2 / appeared to be the most promising addition to CeO/sub 2 /. Tests showed that the Allegheny Ludlum alloy S- 818 alloy is resistant to attack by CeO/sub 2 / and CeF/sub 3 /, but is attacked by Ce metal. Hazards Analysis Analyses of launch abort impact zones for the open core and of aerodynamic burnup for near orbital injection on two types of Mo fuel cores continued. Manufacturing. Fabrication and assembly of the first electrically heated generator was completed. System and Component Test. It was found that lead telluride couples increased in resistivitg after heating to l 000 deg F and masked resistivity changes because of radiation. Inconel X cores were heated to approximately 15 O 0 deg and impacted on either granite or water tatgets. All of thr cerium-metal loaded cores ruptured. Cores loaded with lavite pellets were recovered intact. Heat transfer mockup teats were completed with a revised twolayer stainless steel heat shield. SNAP-III. The 3 MlG 3 thermoelectric generator was repaired and parametric testing resumed. The power output of ths second SNAP-III unit was measured and proof of thermoelectric generator operation for at least a period of a year wae demonstrated. SNAP-III. The performance characteristics of a second SHAP-IIIA generator of completely new design were only marginally better than the original. Tests were performed on metal-encased and ribbon-emitter types of tubes. A wire-wound ceramic heater and a tungsten-wire radiation heater were fabricated and tested. Work wse continued on the molybdenum collector used in conjunction with a Type B impregnated tungsten emitter. Low Power Thermionic Generator. Work on improved heat transfer between the emitter holder and the heat source revealed that a layer of Mo powder between the two surfaces gives a lower film drop and more consistent results. Creep tests on sapphire spacers (Al/sub 2 /O/sub 3 /) showed that some creep takes place above 1200 deg C, and above 1300 deg C, the strength of the sapphire falls off rapidly. A device for measuring the thermal expansion of CeO/ sub 2 / fuel pellets while in a hot cell was fabricated. Thermoelectric 2 - to 5 - Watt Generator. Altitude chamber tests of the generators were successfully completed. A shock-wave test proved the capsule can survive missile propellant detonation. Power output versus time plots were developed for both the cerium- and polonium-fueled systems. (M. C. G. ...|$|E

For example, polls {{have shown that}} more than half of homeowners in the United States have <b>access</b> to a <b>plug</b> to charge their cars. Also most driving is local over short distances which reduces the need for charging mid-trip. In the USA, for example, 78% of commutes are less than [...] round-trip. Nevertheless, longer drives between cities and towns require a network of public charging stations or another method to extend the range of electric vehicles beyond the normal daily commute. One challenge in such infrastructure is the level of demand: an isolated station along a busy highway may see hundreds of customers per hour if every passing electric vehicle has to stop there to complete the trip. In the first half of the 20th century, internal combustion vehicles faced a similar infrastructure problem.|$|R

5000|$|The first German {{jet engines}} built during the Second World War used a {{mechanical}} APU starting system {{designed by the}} German engineer Norbert Riedel. It consisted of a [...] two-stroke flat engine, which for the Junkers Jumo 004 design was hidden in the intake diverter, essentially functioning as a pioneering example of an auxiliary power unit for starting a jet engine. A hole in the extreme nose of the diverter contained a manual pull-handle which started the piston engine, which in turn rotated the compressor. Two spark <b>plug</b> <b>access</b> ports existed in the Jumo 004's intake diverter to service the Reidel unit's cylinders in situ, for maintenance purposes. Two small petrol tanks were fitted in the annular intake. The engine was considered an extreme short stroke (bore / stroke: 70 mm / 35 mm = 2:1) design so it could fit within the intake diverter of jet engines like the Jumo 004. For reduction it had an integrated planetary gear. It was produced by Victoria in Nuremberg {{and served as a}} mechanical APU-style starter for all three German jet engine designs to have made it to at least the prototype stage before May 1945: the Junkers Jumo 004, the BMW 003, and the prototypes (19 built) of the more advanced Heinkel HeS 011 engine, which mounted it just above the intake passage in the Heinkel-crafted sheetmetal of the engine nacelle nose.|$|R
40|$|Crowdsourcing enables programmers to {{incorporate}} “human com-putation ” as a building block in algorithms that cannot be fully automated, such as text analysis and image recognition. Simi-larly, humans {{can be used}} as a building block in data-intensive applications—providing, comparing, and verifying data used by applications. Building upon the decades-long success of declara-tive approaches to conventional data management, we use a similar approach for data-intensive applications that incorporate humans. Specifically, declarative queries are posed over stored relational data as well as data computed on-demand from the crowd, and the underlying system orchestrates the computation of query answers. We present Deco, a database system for declarative crowdsourc-ing. We describe Deco’s data model, query language, and our pro-totype. Deco’s data model was designed to be general (it can be instantiated to other proposed models), flexible (it allows methods for data cleansing and external <b>access</b> to be <b>plugged</b> in), and prin-cipled (it has a precisely-defined semantics). Syntactically, Deco’s query language is a simple extension to SQL. Based on Deco’s data model, we define a precise semantics for arbitrary queries involv-ing both stored data and data obtained from the crowd. We then describe the Deco query processor which uses a novel push-pull hybrid execution model to respect the Deco semantics while coping with the unique combination of latency, monetary cost, and uncer-tainty introduced in the crowdsourcing environment. Finally, we describe our current prototype, and we experimentally explore the query processing alternatives provided by Deco. 1...|$|R
