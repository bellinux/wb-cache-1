40|$|Approaches to {{biodiversity}} and catchment planning increasingly {{recognize the importance}} of the 'wider countryside' rather than the more site-specific focus of traditional environmental management programmes. Biodiversity depends on the viability of ecosystems across the whole countryside, and not only in designated reserves; equally, {{the quantity and quality of}} inland waters reflect overall conditions within river catchments, as well as the hydrological conditions of specific river channels. However, planning of these wider areas involves partnerships and agreements between a range of actors, which generally must be negotiated on a consensual basis and are vulnerable to subsequent dissent. This paper examines the actor-networks which have arisen in some innovative examples of 'wider countryside' planning and assesses their durability and contribution to the <b>attainment</b> <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEuropean {{fisheries}} management have adopted {{maximum sustainable yield}} (MSY) targets for fishing mortality on commercial species to maximise the provision of food. EU member states are also committed to reach Good Environmental Status by 2020 through the Marine Strategy Framework Directive which aims to protect all ecosystem services. So, how will {{fisheries management}} measures contribute to ecosystem functioning and the <b>attainment</b> <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> as measured by improvements in indicators of biodiversity and food webs? We model ecosystem effects of fishing in the North Sea using food web model projections incorporating fishing effort strategies consistent with MSY targets. Correlations between modelled indicators and survey data were significant (p≤ 0. 02). Reduced fishing effort led to increases in size-based indicators and biomasses of benthivores, planktivores and piscivores. However, predation by piscivores depressed bentho-piscivore biomass. Climate warming may also decrease biomasses of bentho-piscivores and piscivores, while planktivores, benthivores and state indicators of size and trophic level may increase. Fisheries management measures will benefit the biodiversity of the fish community in terms of size structure, but not necessarily the food web since decreases in relative biomass of some trophic guilds are expected...|$|E
40|$|Especially in {{environmentally}} sensitive agricultural landscapes, agriculture cannot define its aims by itself - {{it has to}} account {{for a number of}} demands of different groups of society. For example, agriculture is expected to produce food {{and at the same time}} contribute to the protection of cultural landscapes and to further ecological services. Land use concepts for ecologically particularly sensitive agricultural landscapes are often focussed on the attainment of specific environmental objectives in specific areas, neglecting both socioeconomic effects, in particular income effects, and the farmers' income-driven production responses outside these areas. The paper illustrates, on the basis of an empirical study, (1) that the farmers' objectives and production responses need to be integrated in land use concepts for agricultural landscapes because of their potentially counterproductive effects on the <b>attainment</b> <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives,</b> and (2) how multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) can be used to transform a primarily ecology-oriented concept for an ecologically very sensitive agricultural landscape into a more comprehensive one that makes due allowance for the farmers’ responses and society's socio-economic objectives. The authors show that the integration of socio-economic objectives can contribute to the maintenance of incomes and employment without overly harming the attainment of ecological goals. Finally, the paper discusses policy implications resulting from the implementation of land use concepts for agricultural landscapes, in particular in the field of agri-environmental policy, and raises some practical issues that come up if policy makers apply MCDA more widely in the design of such concepts. agricultural landscapes, land-use concepts, multi-criteria decision analysis, Land Economics/Use, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|E

The paper {{tried to make a}} contribution to our understanding <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> policy and policy processes within the Russia in general terms and to the nature <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> agenda setting in Pskov region in more specific terms. This thesis is therefore explores environmental agenda setting process in Russia taking into consideration contemporary trends in the analysis of policy- making, such as inclusion of non-state actors as well as role of ideas shaping actors attitudes and behaviour. The purpose of the thesis is to study the relationship between transnational forces and interactions, national policy and local political developments and the role of various agents and institutions in agenda setting <b>of</b> the regional <b>environmental</b> policy-making. The frame of reference is constituted by a theoretical combination of the agenda-setting model with constructivist approach in order to broaden our investigation of the implications <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> policy-making, impact <b>of</b> political culture upon construction <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> issues, and transformations in the public policy. By focusing on Pskov region case, the paper identifies and discusses a number <b>of</b> reasons why <b>environmental</b> issues are found on the margins of the political agenda. A central argument is that in the absence of effective governance in the Pskov region, international agents together with regional interest groups formulate environmental agenda. The paper concludes that, even though, the mentality of environmentalism is set through the foreign assistance, the processes of learning from international cooperation may contribute to <b>attainment</b> <b>of</b> regional <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives...</b>|$|R
40|$|Environment {{and society}} are {{increasingly}} affected by human activity. World society must constantly face many {{problems such as}} climate change, air, water and soil pollutions, resources overuse, human rights, child labor, social inequalities, health and safety. Since companies are the most responsible actors for these troubles, they are stimulated to develop and adopt policies of sustainable development. Practices of Corporate Sustainability and Responsibility are increasing within many businesses for reasons which go beyond the mere compliance with legislations and regulations. Nowadays, sustainable and responsible companies behave ethically for competitive reasons as well. The connections between sustainability and business strategy occurs through the pursuit of eco-socio-efficiencies, resources cost cutting, product-service differentiation, access to ethical funds, image and reputation, and the avoidance of fines, penalties and environmental taxes. Sustainability management occurs through a process that starts with identification of key stakeholders and the relative types <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> or social impacts generated. Then, strategy must be developed, and communicated to all level of the organization. Leadership and commitment of top management are fundamental in order to diffuse sustainability guidelines, support the organizational structure and spread the new culture. In addition, performance measurement and management systems should drive the <b>attainment</b> <b>of</b> sustainability <b>objectives.</b> <b>Environmental</b> and social accounting systems must provide meaningful data in order to monitor the accomplishment of strategy and, at the same time, disclose the sustainability reports addressed to stakeholders. One {{important aspect of the}} process above mentioned regards the connection between strategy and performance measurement system. In order to translate sustainability strategies into actions measurable through performance indicators, it must be emphasized the support of Balanced Scorecard (BSC). The multidimensional conception of the tool advises to integrate environmental and social aspects of business activity within the four traditional perspectives of management in the BSC (financial, customers, processes, learning and growth). Therefore, the emerging concept of Sustainability Balanced Scorecard (SBSC) is referred to the additional feature <b>of</b> considering the <b>environmental</b> and social issues connected directly or indirectly with the execution of the business processes and thus with economic success. Cause and effect relationships in the strategy map show the relations between better social and environmental performances with increasing competitiveness and profitability. The airline sector is facing many challenges of sustainable development. Hence the case developed about a real carrier can help to better understand the matter. The implementation of a Sustainability Balanced Scorecard in Lufthansa Passenger Airline consists in a simulation of the process that starts with the identification of stakeholders and related environmental and social impacts. Based on these exposures, sustainability strategies are developed and formalized as several strategic objectives belonging to the different perspectives of SBSC. Afterwards, for each sustainability objective, numerous key performance indicators are developed in order to monitor single operative aspects related to the achievement of objectives. Finally, the construction of strategy map makes clear how sustainability performances are connected with financial ones. In conclusion, the analysis <b>of</b> <b>environmental,</b> social and economic performances achieved by the German carrier and the comparison with direct European competitor Air France KLM and other minor competitors helps to identify the successes and criticisms deriving from sustainability purposes...|$|R

The paper illustrates, {{on the basis of}} an empirical study on the land use in the southern German region Bayerisches Donauried, (1) that the farmers' objectives and production responses need to be integrated in land use concepts for agricultural landscapes because of their potentially counterproductive effects on the <b>attainment</b> <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives,</b> and (2) how multi-criteria analysis (MCA) can be used to transform a primarily ecology-oriented land use concept for an ecologically very sensitive agricultural landscape into a more comprehensive one that makes due allowance for the farmers responses and society's socio-economic objectives. The authors show that such integration of socioeconomic objectives can contribute to the maintenance of incomes and employment without overly harming the attainment of ecological goals. As far as the MCA is concerned, two methods are applied: The linear-additive model, and the outranking model ELECTRE. The models serve to evaluate four different land use options. Nine criteria are used, derived from the relevant landscape functions. Weights are based on written interviews with major decision-makers, and stakeholders of the region. The major assumptions underlying the models are discussed. The authors interpret the results of each model on the basis of sensitivity analyses, and compare them. Finally, the paper discusses policy implications resulting from the implementation of land use concepts for agricultural landscapes, in particular the question of a regionalisation of agri-environmental policy, and raises some administrative and practical issues that come up if policy makers apply MCA more widely in the design of such concepts.

40|$|The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has {{established}} environmental flow standards in seven river systems {{through a process}} defined by the Texas Legislature in its 2007 Senate Bill 3 (SB 3). The environmental flow standards have been incorporated in the state?s water right permitting system with a priority date that corresponds to the date when the flow recommendations were received by the TCEQ. Therefore, all the environmental flow standards in the different systems are junior to the water rights previously granted in the state. This thesis first presents a comprehensive literature review <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> flow standards and {{an explanation of the}} process that led to the implementation <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> flow standards in Texas. Moreover, a comparative assessment regarding the structure <b>of</b> the <b>environmental</b> flow standards is presented to reveal the differences between the river systems defined by TCEQ.

This assessment revealed that none of the standards are met 100 % of the time due to the priority system that regulates surface water in the state. This system protects old water rights in the state, so environmental flow standards only affect water availability of future water rights. Because of this, this study included frequency analyses for unappropriated flows considering two scenarios for each system: (a) without including SB 3 standards and (b) including SB 3 standards.

40|$|Multi-objective {{optimization}} (MOO) {{is increasingly}} {{being used in}} a wide variety of applications to identify alternatives that balance several criteria. The energy sector is not an exception to this trend. Unfortunately, the complexity of MOO grows with the number <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives.</b> This limitation is critical in energy systems, in which several environmental criteria are typically used to assess the merits of a given technology. In this paper, we investigate the use of a rigorous dimensionality reduction method for reducing the complexity of MOO as applied to an energy system (i. e., a solar Rankine cycle coupled with reverse osmosis and thermal storage). Instead of using an aggregated environmental metric, a common approach for reducing the number <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>objectives</b> in MOO, we propose to optimize the system in a reduced search space of objectives that fully describe its performance and which results from eliminating redundant criteria from the analysis. Numerical results show that it is possible to reduce the problem complexity by omitting redundant environmental indicators from the optimization.
