The movement and attack ranges of enemies can be optionally displayed to players. While seventy-four units are accessible in-game by completing its chapters, only twelve can be taken into battle at any one time. When two units engage, a separate battle screen activates, and the battle plays out automatically. Enemy resistances to weapons are covered by the Weapon Triangle: lances are strong against swords, swords are strong against axes, and axes are strong against lances. Each unit gains experience points with each action, and when they accumulate 100 points, they level up and their stats are randomly raised.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{characterize}} antithrombin (<b>AT)</b> <b>levels</b> {{in normal}} pregnancy. MethodsWe performed secondary analyses {{with data from}} 3 studies. Using a single measurement from each subject in the first analysis (cross-sectional), we correlated <b>AT</b> <b>levels</b> with gestational age {{from the middle of}} the second trimester throughout the third trimester of pregnancy. Using serial measurements in a second analysis (cohort), we compared <b>AT</b> <b>levels</b> between the late first and second trimesters of pregnancy and baseline (the <b>level</b> <b>at</b> 6 weeks postpartum). Using serial measurements in a third analysis (cohort), we analyzed the pattern of change in <b>AT</b> <b>levels</b> in the immediate postpartum period. Assays of AT activity were performed using the Dade Behring (Siemens) Berichrom Antithrombin III Chromogenic Assay. <b>AT</b> <b>levels</b> were correlated with gestational age using the Pearson correlation coefficient and compared between the different time points using one-way ANOVA. ResultsOverall, <b>AT</b> <b>levels</b> were 20 % lower than baseline during pregnancy (p< 0. 01). There was no significant difference between <b>AT</b> <b>levels</b> obtained between late first trimester and late second trimester. From midtrimester to term, however, <b>AT</b> <b>levels</b> were negatively correlated with gestational age with a 13 % drop during this period of time (r=− 0. 26 [− 0. 39, − 0. 11]; p< 0. 01). Immediately after childbirth, <b>AT</b> <b>levels</b> fell precipitously to 30 % below baseline (p< 0. 05) and reached a nadir 12 hours postpartum before rising and returning to baseline by 72 hours postpartum. ConclusionIt appears that antithrombin (AT) is consumed at the time of delivery. Our findings have implications for AT replacement or even anticoagulation at the time of delivery...|$|R

5|$|Level Mountain can be ecologically {{divided into}} three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a largely {{destroyed}} Abies lasiocarpa forest on its flanks and a Picea glauca forest at its base.

5|$|Level Mountain has {{experienced}} volcanic eruptions sporadically {{for the last}} 15 million years, making it the most persistent volcano of the NCVP.

Such volcanism commonly occurs at hotspots, continental rifts and leaky transform faults. The existence of olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel xenocrysts in Level Mountain basalt suggest that volcanism at the massif originated from the upper mantle.

5|$|Like {{several other}} volcanoes in {{northern}} British Columbia, Level Mountain was volcanically active during past glacial periods. Its involvement with glaciation resulted in several interactions between magma and ice, affording multiple examples of glaciovolcanic processes. Evidence for contemporaneous volcanism and glaciation is widespread throughout the massif. This includes interlayered unconsolidated fluvioglacial and tuffaceous deposits, tills and glacial erratics {{at the base}} of tuffs and lava flows, lahars composed of till and agglomerate, tuyas on the uppermost surface of the shield and as outliers, till cemented by siliceous sinter and the presence of freshwater pillow basalts and volcano-glacial tuff breccias. It is possible that geothermal outputs <b>at</b> <b>Level</b> Mountain had an influence on dynamics of past ice sheets much like the modern Grímsvötn caldera is an important heat source beneath Vatnajökull in Iceland.

5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} it emphasizes justice {{to the exclusion of}} other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck <b>at</b> <b>level</b> 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E
