5|$|Blaine and Harrison {{wished to}} see American power and trade {{expanded}} across the Pacific and were {{especially interested in}} securing rights to harbors in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Pago Pago, Samoa. When Blaine entered office, the United States, Great Britain, and the German Empire were disputing their respective rights in Samoa. Thomas F. Bayard, Blaine’s predecessor, had accepted <b>an</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> three-party conference in Berlin aimed at resolving the dispute, and Blaine appointed American representatives to attend.

By 1884, they were meeting regularly, and in 1885, after an initial rejection, she agreed to marry him. The wedding took place at the Herron home on June 19, 1886. William Taft remained devoted to his wife throughout their almost 44 years of marriage. Nellie Taft pushed her husband much as his parents had, and she could be very frank with her criticisms. The couple had three children, of which the eldest, Robert, became a U.S. senator.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{toured the}} Philippines in July 1966, playing two {{shows at the}} Rizal Memorial Football Stadium in Manila. Epstein unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady Imelda Marcos when {{presented}} with <b>an</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> breakfast party. He had politely declined {{on behalf of the}} group, as it was their policy never to accept such official invitations. The Beatles and their entourage were ejected from their hotel on the same day and given a police escort to the airport, even though Epstein had publicly apologised for the misunderstanding in a televised statement, which was not seen or heard because of static. The entourage boarded the plane for home, but Epstein and Beatles' assistant Mal Evans were ordered off, both believing {{that they would not be}} allowed back on the plane. Epstein was forced to give the tax authorities £6,800 worth of Philippine peso notes earned from the Manila shows and to sign a tax bond verifying the exchange before being allowed back on the plane with Evans.|$|E

Judah I once invited him to a meal, and exceptionally he decided to accept the invitation; but on arriving at the house of the patriarch he noticed in the yard mules of a certain kind the use of which was forbidden by local custom on account of the danger in handling them. Thereupon he retraced his steps and did not return (Hul. l.c.).|$|E

25|$|Gibbs' squads {{struggled}} to build success off two moderately successful seasons, 1991 and 1993. In 1991, OU went 9-3, finished the season ranked No. 16 {{in the nation}} by the Associated Press, and soundly defeated Virginia in the Gator Bowl. In the 1992 follow-up campaign, however, OU finished 5-4-2, unranked and did not earn <b>an</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> post-season bowl. Further, OU dropped games to rivals Nebraska and Texas and tied Oklahoma State. The draw with the Cowboys {{marked the first time}} since 1976 OU did not beat OSU in the annual Bedlam game. Gibbs' Sooners rebounded with a 9–3 record, a No. 17 finish in the final Associated Press poll and a Sun Bowl victory in 1993. En route, OU beat then-fifth-ranked Texas A, 44–14, and recorded its only victory against Texas under Gibbs. The 1994 season proved to be another letdown, though, as OU finished 6–6. Gibbs announced his resignation prior to OU's losses to Nebraska in the regular-season finale and Brigham Young University in the Copper Bowl. Ultimately, it was his record against Oklahoma's major rivals that did him in. Gibbs went 2–15–1 against Texas, Nebraska and Colorado. In addition to his record, he was thought to be uncomfortable around alumni and the media, and with being a head coach in general. Gibbs' final record as head coach at OU was 44-23-2.|$|E

Other social events also turn sour: a lunch party with Mr Finsworth, the father of an old friend, is marred by some unfortunate comments by Pooter on the Finsworth family portraits. On another occasion they meet a loud and over-opinionated American, Mr Hardfur Huttle who, Pooter realises, is like a mature version of Lupin.|$|E

After hearing of Spivey from the publisher, who indicated a desire to have him attend the university, Wachs notified Kentucky's men's basketball coach, Adolph Rupp, who elected to have a scout watch Spivey play. Following positive feedback from the scout, Rupp gave Spivey <b>an</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> camp held at Alumni Gymnasium, where he would try out against other leading high school seniors.

500|$|Sellers's {{first film}} {{appearance}} of 1968 was a reunion with Blake Edwards for the [...] comedy The Party, {{in which he}} starred alongside Claudine Longet and Denny Miller. He appears as Hrundi V. Bakshi, a bungling Indian actor who accidentally receives <b>an</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lavish Hollywood dinner party. His character, according to Sellers's biographer Peter Evans, was [...] "clearly an amalgam of Clouseau and the doctor in The Millionairess". Roger Lewis notes that like a number of Sellers's characters, he is played in a sympathetic and dignified manner. He followed it later that year with Hy Averback's I Love You, Alice B. Toklas, playing an attorney who abandons his lifestyle to become a hippie. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars, remarking that Sellers was [...] "back doing what he does best", although {{he also said that}} in Sellers's previous films he had [...] "been at his worst recently".|$|E
