5|$|The MBTA {{installed}} platforms {{with yellow}} edge strips for the 1980 return of service, and later <b>added</b> <b>metal</b> shelters and platform fences to separate passengers from freight trains. No major upgrades {{to the station}} were made {{as part of the}} Fitchburg Line Improvement Project, though a 2005 report proposed combining Ayer and Shirley into a Devens station with additional parking capacity. The plan was unpopular with local residents, who preferred the stations close to the town centers, and the MBTA dropped the consolidation plan.|$|E

The park has since <b>added</b> <b>metal</b> detectors at the front gate, with additional security.|$|E
25|$|AM {{processes}} for metal sintering or melting (such as selective laser sintering, direct metal laser sintering, and selective laser melting) usually went {{by their own}} individual names in the 1980s and 1990s. At the time, all metalworking was done by processes that we now call non-additive (casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining); although plenty of automation was applied to those technologies (such as by robot welding and CNC), {{the idea of a}} tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal (rather than adding it), such as CNC milling, CNC EDM, and many others. But the automated techniques that <b>added</b> <b>metal,</b> which would later be called additive manufacturing, were beginning to challenge that assumption. By the mid-1990s, new techniques for material deposition were developed at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, including microcasting and sprayed materials. Sacrificial and support materials had also become more common, enabling new object geometries.|$|E

2500|$|In 1928, the Stromberg-Voisinet {{firm was}} the first company to sell an {{electric}} stringed instrument and amplifier package. However, musicians found that the amps had an [...] "unsatisfactory tone and volume, [...] dependability problems", so the product did not sell well. Even though the Stromberg-Voisinet amp did not sell well, it still launched a new idea: a portable electric instrument amp with a speaker, all in an easily transported wooden cabinet. In 1929, Vega electrics launched a portable banjo amplifier. In 1932, Electro String Instruments and amplifier (this {{is not the same}} company as Stromberg Electro Instruments) introduced a guitar amp with [...] "high output" [...] and a [...] "string driven magnetic pickup". Electro set out the standard template for combo amps: a wooden cabinet with the electronic amplifier mounted inside, and a convenient carrying handle to facilitate transporting the cabinet. 1n 1933, Vivi-Tone amp set-ups were used for live performances and radio shows. In 1934, Rickenbacker launched a similar combo amp that <b>added</b> <b>metal</b> corner protectors to keep the corners in good condition during transportation.|$|E
5000|$|The Owen-Cox House [...] "was {{originally}} {{an earlier}} one-story brick residence but wasremodeled into the Italianate style ca. 1875. The house was again remodeled inthe early 1900s with <b>added</b> <b>metal</b> columns." ...|$|E

50|$|The 1983 bombing {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of tightened security measures throughout the Capitol. The area outside the Senate Chamber, previously open to the public, was permanently closed.

50|$|Thermofluor pre-screens can be {{performed}} that sample {{a wide range of}} pH, ionic strength and additives such as <b>added</b> <b>metal</b> ions and cofactors.

50|$|Common {{oxidation}} {{states of}} gold include +1 (gold(I) or aurous compounds) and +3 (gold(III) or auric compounds). Gold ions in solution are readily reduced and precipitated as metal by adding any other metal as the reducing agent. The <b>added</b> <b>metal</b> is oxidized and dissolves, allowing the gold to be displaced from solution and be recovered as a solid precipitate.|$|E
50|$|In 1915 the Germans {{undertook}} {{an improvement}} {{program for the}} Liège positions, modifying entrances, adding concrete cover and <b>adding</b> <b>metal</b> decking under concrete ceilings.

50|$|Most current fully {{automatic}} trigger groups will not fit their semi-automatic firearm look-alike counterparts - the semi-automatic version is specifically constructed {{to reject the}} {{fully automatic}} trigger group by <b>adding</b> <b>metal</b> in critical places.

50|$|Purity is {{paramount}} in avoiding contamination. Purity {{can be achieved}} by blending pure gases under high heat or by purifying water vapor as it is generated. In either case, the piping and instrumentation must be carefully chosen to avoid <b>adding</b> <b>metals,</b> particles or other contaminants back into the water vapor.|$|R
5000|$|Urban {{locations}} are constantly {{at risk of}} being vandalized or abused. Skateboarders are often found riding along many surfaces of the built environment. Elements not designed for this purpose may be damaged in the process. Although skateboarding is illegal within many vicinities, signs are frequently ignored. Consequently, patrons can often be left feeling irritated and threatened. As a solution, designers have <b>added</b> <b>metal</b> protrusions to benches and other flat surfaces in order to prevent skateboarders from riding across these surfaces. [...] This method of prevention is now commonly seen in many outdoor locations within urban settings.|$|E
5000|$|Today, {{transverse}} [...] "simple system Irish" [...] flutes {{are being}} made for the playing {{of a variety of}} traditional musical styles. In the Irish tradition, the material used is most commonly wood, but also Delrin, PVC, and even bamboo is used - though wood is still by far the most popular material. These modern Irish flutes can vary in the number of <b>added</b> <b>metal</b> keys, or have no keys at all. Most are tuned using modern methods and are typically better in tune with modern instruments. All have the basic six hole diatonic design as in a tinwhistle.|$|E
50|$|The Godzilla suit {{itself was}} {{constructed}} by Kanji Yagi, Koei Yagi, and Eizo Kaimai, who used thin bamboo sticks and wire {{to build a}} frame for {{the interior of the}} suit and <b>added</b> <b>metal</b> mesh and cushioning over it to bolster its structure and finally applied coats of latex. Coats of molten rubber were additionally applied, followed by carved indentations and strips of latex glued onto the surface of the suit to create Godzilla's scaly hide. This first version of the suit weighed 100 kilograms (220 pounds). For close-ups, Toshimitsu created a smaller scale, mechanical, hand-operated puppet that sprayed streams of mist from its mouth to act as Godzilla's atomic breath.|$|E
50|$|The viaduct was {{the most}} {{substantial}} single structure on the line. It is sharply curved, necessitating the provision of a check rail in its active railway days. In 1953 extensive repair work was undertaken in which the opportunity was taken to raise the parapet and <b>add</b> <b>metal</b> railings on top.|$|R
25|$|Various design {{variations}} and amplification {{techniques have}} been used to make mandolins comparable in volume with louder instruments and orchestras, including the creation of mandolin-banjo hybrid with the louder banjo, <b>adding</b> <b>metal</b> resonators (most notably by Dobro and the National String Instrument Corporation) to make a resonator mandolin, and amplifying electric mandolins through amplifiers.|$|R
50|$|Bruce also <b>adds</b> <b>metal</b> gauntlets with {{scallops}} on the forearms, {{an innovation}} derived from {{his experience as}} a pupil of Ra's al Ghul's League of Shadows.
