Among the defeated incumbents were dissident leader Brown, the convicted Unwin, the expelled Barnes, and the Provincial Treasurer Low. Aberhart won re-election by running in Calgary; his replacement <b>as</b> <b>Social</b> Credit candidate in Okotoks–High River was soundly defeated.

5|$|An {{articulate}} {{expression of}} Greek republicanism {{can be found}} in the works of the revolutionary author Rigas Feraios. Feraios' execution in 1798 at the hands of the Ottomans gave an aura of heroism to these political ideas, which also visualized the liberation of Greece in the context of political reforms. In addition to Feraios' writings, other works in the same polemical style took on a sharper revolutionary character, <b>as</b> <b>social</b> contradictions in the Ottoman Empire grew.|$|E

The analyses indicate the main dimensions of stigmatization <b>as</b> a <b>social</b> process.

5|$|Dominican {{folk music}} is an oral tradition, learned informally through {{watching}} others perform. As of 1987, most performers of traditional music were either over 50 {{years old or}} under 35, which indicates an ongoing revival of previously declining traditions. Music is evaluated based on both characteristics of the music, such as complex syncopated rhythms, as well <b>as</b> <b>social</b> factors, {{such as the ability}} of the performers to improvise and respond to their surroundings and to keep the audience excited and participating in the music.|$|E

40|$|A vast body of {{research}} has shown information science to be a social science, but information science’s identity <b>as</b> both a <b>social</b> science and a non-social science has become all the more uncertain, or simply has been left to {{the discretion of the}} reader. Method. This paper traces the specifics of information science <b>as</b> a <b>social</b> science. The paper examines the background of the social sciences in the history of academic disciplines. The paper discusses the ways in which positivism and interpretativism, the leading traditions of the social sciences, assert themselves in information science <b>as</b> a <b>social</b> science. Conclusions. It is argued that received ideas about the social sciences impact how information science <b>as</b> a <b>social</b> science is perceived. It is also argued that information science <b>as</b> a <b>social</b> science can and should provide valid scientific explanations. This paper distinguishes <b>social</b> interaction <b>as</b> the defining feature of information science <b>as</b> a <b>social</b> science. To this end, the paper proposes global complexity not as a theory or solution, but as a metaphor for information science <b>as</b> a <b>social</b> science to address the pressing issues of our increasingly interconnected world...|$|R
5|$|Grunge fuses {{elements}} of punk rock and heavy metal, {{such as the}} distorted electric guitar used in both genres, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Like these genres, grunge typically uses electric guitar, bass guitar, a drummer and a singer. Grunge also incorporates influences from indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth. Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often addressing themes such <b>as</b> <b>social</b> alienation, apathy, concerns about confinement, and a desire for freedom.|$|E

5|$|A dance crew {{is a team}} {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time that the different dance moves within breaking developed organically. All styles of hip-hop are rooted in battling, and {{being a part of}} a crew {{was the only way to}} learn when these styles began because they were not taught in studios: they all started out <b>as</b> <b>social</b> dances. Forming and participating in a crew is how street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships. In breaking in particular, battling is how b-boys/b-girls improved their skill.|$|E
5|$|A diverse {{range of}} groups have raised issues, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), over the welfare of animals, {{governmental}} and social agencies over health issues and compliance with nutritional labeling laws, and unions and trade groups over labor relations and laws. These situations have touched on the concepts of animal rights, corporate responsibility and ethics, as well <b>as</b> <b>social</b> justice. While {{the majority of the}} disputes did not result in lawsuits, in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions, dealt with statutory compliance, or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties. The resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees or how it does business with the public.|$|E
40|$|Literacy <b>as</b> a <b>social</b> {{practice}} {{has a fundamental role}} in children’s lives {{especially in the}} early years context, in which social interactions are in the centre of knowledge achievement. Several pieces of research investigate the positive contribution of the arts in children’s literacy development in the early years settings. However, most of them focus on the aspect of emergent literacy and phonological awareness, with some indirect arguments about literacy <b>as</b> a <b>social</b> practice. Having this in mind and the importance of literacy <b>as</b> a <b>social</b> practice, this project was designed. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the effects of the arts in the development of literacy <b>as</b> a <b>social</b> practice in the early years settings. The intervention used the ‘Play and Learn through the Arts’ (PLA) programme for a full school year in a case study with 5 - 6 -year-old children in Greece. The outcomes were measured using authentic assessment techniques and a semi-structure interview. The findings showed the positive contribution of the arts in the development of literacy <b>as</b> a <b>social</b> practice in the early years setting...|$|R

In later seasons, Sesame Street addressed real-life disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} Indonesia in 1942, Santoso {{left her}} work as a teacher and found employment as legal assistant to Soepomo, who later became the country's first minister of justice. In 1945, with the Japanese preparing to withdraw from the Indies and the proclamation of independence looming, Santoso {{became a member of the}} Committee for Preparatory Work for Indonesian Independence. On 12 March 1946, Santoso became the first ever female cabinet member when she was selected as services minister in the Second Sjahrir Cabinet. Working quickly and efficiently, she found herself organising the return of internees from Japanese-run camps. She was kept on through the Third Sjahrir Cabinet, but when it dissolved on 26 June 1947, Santoso refused another term <b>as</b> <b>social</b> minister. She instead chose to work as head of prime minister Amir Sjarifuddin's secretariat. She kept this position into the First Hatta Cabinet. During Operation Kraai, a Dutch-led offensive on the city of Yogyakarta on 19 December 1948, her husband was killed outside Maguwo.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women in}} industrialised {{countries}} have narrowed {{the gender gap}} in life expectancy and now live longer than men, {{in many areas of}} health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes. Gender remains an important social determinant of health, since women's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, and family responsibilities. Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such <b>as</b> <b>social</b> and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including health care, and the greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater adverse impact on health.|$|E
