5|$|As {{time goes}} on, Shana and Yuji {{encounter}} several more Flame Haze, such as Margery Daw and Wilhelmina Carmel, and Denizens in Misaki City. An organization of Denizens called Bal Masqué discovers that Yuji possesses the Reiji Maigo {{and attempt to}} use the Treasure Tool on two separate occasions. Bal Masqué is led by three Lords called the Trinity: Hecate, Sydonay, and Bel Peol. They serve under a Crimson God known as the , who resides within the Reiji Maigo. When the Snake of the Festival emerges, it merges its consciousness with Yuji's, assuming command over Bal Masqué, and together they formulate an elaborate plan to create a parallel world called Xanadu, which {{will serve as a}} paradise for Denizens with unlimited Power of Existence. Shana, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Flame Haze around the world, oppose the creation of Xanadu, which would eventually cause a large-scale disruption in the human world, the Crimson Realm and Xanadu itself.|$|E

Tabitha is glad to be able to spend a few days with Lisa and says they will temporarily be sisters. Darrin is another of Larry's employees at advertising agency McMann and Tate. Darrin is trying to land a million-dollar account from Mr. Brockway (Parley Baer), who owns a toy company. Mr. Brockway visits the Stephens residence unannounced to find out if Darrin has any dark secrets. When Mr. Brockway arrives, Samantha is tending to Adam upstairs, so Lisa answers the door. When Lisa says her father works for McMann and Tate and that she is Tabitha's sister, Mr. Brockway leaves, saying he has seen enough.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 October 1916, a fire was {{discovered}} in the Imperatritsa Mariyas forward powder magazine while at anchor in Sevastopol, but it exploded before any efforts {{could be made to}} fight the fire. Sailors led by Engineer-Mechanic Midshipman Ignatyev, however, managed to flood the forward shell magazine before the explosion at the cost of their own lives. Their action probably prevented a catastrophic detonation <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> magazines were flooded as a precaution. About forty minutes after the first explosion, a second occurred {{in the vicinity of the}} torpedo compartment that destroyed the watertight integrity of the rest of the forward bulkheads. Imperatritsa Mariya began to sink by the bow and listed to starboard. She capsized a few minutes later, taking 228 sailors with her. The subsequent investigation determined that the explosion was probably the result of spontaneous combustion of the nitrocellulose-based propellant as it decomposed.|$|E

This was the last bombardment of 1916 as the monitors reverted to their role of supporting the Dover Barrage and making anti-destroyer patrols between Calais and The Downs. Lord Clive was given a refit at Southampton during October–November 1916.|$|E
25|$|Like other Neolithic societies, the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture {{had almost}} no {{division}} of labor.

Ben Ghedhahem found that he could not rally the tribes to resist, as the Bey's money had bought some of them off. The tribes started to quarrel - Ben Ghedhahem's own tribe was attacked by the Hamma tribe - and turned to unrestrained looting rather than concerted resistance.|$|E
25|$|In August 1965, {{elements}} of the 35th Infantry started their rotation into the Vietnam War, arriving in South Vietnam. The 1st and 2d battalions, along with the 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry, and the 2d Battalion, 9th Artillery provided the core combat units of the 3d Brigade, 25th Infantry Division and were deployed to the Central Highlands at Pleiku. Final units arrived by Christmas 1965. The battalions of the 35th Infantry were heavily engaged from January 1966 until 1972 throughout the I Corps and II Corps areas of operations (the Central Highlands and central coastal areas of Vietnam). In August 1967, operational control of the two battalions of the 35th Infantry <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> parts of the 3d Brigade were transferred from the 25th Infantry Division to the 4th Infantry Division (which had deployed to the Central Highlands in late 1966).|$|E

Contrary to popular belief, the Neolithic people experienced considerable abundance of food and other resources. This lack of competition for limited resources {{was probably one of the}} reasons that the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture (as with most of the other European Neolithic cultures) had no evidence of war throughout their entire existence. If the population of a community became too large, and began to outstrip the ability of the surrounding environment to support the inhabitants' needs, there were still vast, unexploited territories around them that a break-off group could easily travel to and start a new settlement without fear of encroaching on some other group's territorial lands. These settlements did indeed grow and divide; during its existence the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture's geographical region expanded immensely as the population increased and new communities were established.|$|E

500|$|These {{articles}} {{caught the}} attention of Otis Barton, an engineer who had long admired Beebe and who had his own ambition to become a deep-sea explorer. Barton was convinced that Beebe's design for a diving vessel would never be capable of withstanding the extreme pressure of the deep ocean, {{and with the help of}} a friend who arranged a meeting with Beebe, proposed an alternative design to him. Barton's design called for a spherical vessel, which was the strongest possible shape for resisting high pressure. Barton had the good fortune that years earlier, Theodore Roosevelt had proposed a similar idea to Beebe, and Beebe approved of Barton's design. Beebe and Barton made a deal: Barton would pay for the sphere <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> equipment to go with it. In return, Beebe would pay for other expenses such as chartering a ship to raise and lower the sphere, and as the owner of the sphere Barton would accompany Beebe on his expeditions in it. Beebe named their vessel the Bathysphere, from the Greek prefix bathy- meaning [...] "deep" [...] combined with [...] "sphere".|$|E
500|$|James Jesse Strang (March 21, 1813 – July 9, 1856) was an American {{religious}} leader, {{politician and}} self-proclaimed monarch.

Rigdon claimed leadership of the church as the senior member of the First Presidency and Young claimed it as senior member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles. Strang returned to Wisconsin and established his church headquarters there, excommunicating the apostles who did not support him, including Young. During his 12 years serving as Prophet, Seer and Revelator of his church, Strang reigned for six years as the crowned [...] "king" [...] of an ecclesiastical monarchy that he established on Beaver Island in the US state of Michigan.
