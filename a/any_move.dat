5|$|Except for <b>any</b> <b>move</b> of {{the knight}} and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is {{captured}} (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces {{it on its}} square (en passant is the only exception). The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game. The king can be put in check but cannot be captured (see below).|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} from other games were meant {{to have some of}} their moves changed or removed in order to balance them with KOF's new characters. However, designers focused in adjusting the imbalance of certain characters without removing <b>any</b> <b>move.</b> In the end, creators of the series noted that the Art of Fighting characters were the strongest ones in the game. Nevertheless, other characters such as Terry and Andy Bogard became the ones who got the designers' utmost attention and were given new moves.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, Montgomery {{organized}} another expedition {{against the}} British fort. In total, he had 1,400 men. He sent a naval component, with 1 schooner, 1 sloop, and 10 bateaux with 350 troops to counter <b>any</b> <b>move</b> by the British warship, Royal Savage. Montgomery took {{the rest of}} his force and sailed up the river, landing near St. Johns on September 17. The British garrison was 725 men commanded by Major Charles Preston, who just 3 years earlier had been Montgomery's superior officer in the British Army.|$|E

5|$|On {{learning}} {{that they had}} been outmanoeuvred, the allied commanders debated their options. They decided to march south to Tadcaster and Cawood, where they could both protect their own supply lines from Hull, and also block <b>any</b> <b>move</b> south by Rupert {{on either side of the}} Ouse. Their foot (infantry), ordnance and baggage set off early on 2 July, leaving the cavalry and dragoons, commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax, as rearguard. At about 9am, the allied generals learned that Rupert's army had crossed the captured bridge of boats at Poppleton, and was advancing onto Marston Moor. The Covenanter and Parliamentarian foot, some of whom had already reached Tadcaster, were hastily recalled.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his agent}} Milan Ćalasan's insistence {{that his client}} would not be playing in the lower divisions, Žigić {{underwent}} groin surgery in the close season and resumed his Birmingham career in September. He told the Mail {{that he would be}} happy to stay and that <b>any</b> <b>move</b> would depend on the club, which was in increasing financial difficulty, wanting to sell. His first Championship goal gave Birmingham a 1–0 win against Leeds United. Early in the Europa League group match at Braga, Birmingham were awarded a penalty. In the absence of regular penalty-taker Marlon King, Žigić took on the responsibility. His attempt was saved, Braga won the match 1–0, and Birmingham finished the group one point behind them and Club Brugge so failed to qualify for the knockout rounds. Away to Leeds, Žigić scored all four in a 4–1 win, and he finished the season with eleven in the league and one in the play-off semi-final as Birmingham lost on aggregate to Blackpool.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{remained}} in New York City until March, when the Continental Congress {{sent him to}} South Carolina; the defenses' construction was left to General William Alexander (Lord Stirling). Troops were in limited supply, so Washington found the defenses incomplete, but Lee had concluded {{that it would be}} impossible to hold the city with the British commanding the sea. He reasoned that the defenses should be located with the ability to inflict heavy casualties upon the British if <b>any</b> <b>move</b> was made to take and hold ground. Barricades and redoubts were established in and around the city, and the bastion of Fort Stirling across the East River in Brooklyn Heights, facing the city. Lee also saw that the immediate area was cleared of Loyalists.|$|E

50|$|On 1 September 2015, <b>Anier</b> <b>moved</b> on loan to Hibernian, {{initially}} for {{the remainder}} of the 2015-16 season, however he was recalled to Tannadice in January 2016 after making just three substitute appearances for Hibernian.|$|R
5|$|The {{allies were}} aware of Rupert's {{approach}} and had been hoping that reinforcements from the Midlands under Sir John Meldrum and the Earl of Denbigh could ward off this threat, but they learned that these forces could not intervene in time. The allied armies around York were separated from each other by rivers, and if Rupert attacked them in their siege lines he could destroy any one army before the other two could come to its aid. Therefore, they abandoned the siege {{on the night of}} 30 June, and concentrated their forces near the village of Hessay before taking position on Marston Moor, where they blocked Rupert's expected direct march to York (along the old Roman road named Ermine Street, the modern A59), and could easily move to their left to prevent Rupert making <b>any</b> <b>move</b> to the south via Wetherby.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Saraiva, Ouro Preto was {{a staunch}} monarchist who was {{determined}} to save the regime at any cost. His program of reforms was highly ambitious and aimed at resolving festering issues about which politicians had long been complaining. An item notably missing from his agenda was <b>any</b> <b>move</b> to address the military indiscipline and the urgent necessity of restoration of government authority over the corps. This {{would prove to be}} a fatal mistake. Among the reforms proposed were the expanding of voting rights by abolishing the income requisite, the end of lifelong senate tenures and, most important of all, increased decentralization which would turn the country into a full federation by allowing the election of town mayors and provincial presidents (governors).|$|E
5|$|Just before junior prom, Jesse returns, having flunked out of UCLA, and Rachel invites him to {{the prom}} with her, Sam and Mercedes (Amber Riley). Jesse and Finn are {{kicked out of the}} prom when Finn picks a fight with Jesse over his attentions to Rachel on the dance floor, which {{effectively}} ends Finn and Quinn's campaign for prom king and queen. Finn ultimately breaks up with Quinn when he realizes he has a deeper connection with Rachel, {{despite the fact that she}} and Jesse seem to be a couple again. At Nationals, as the New Directions are about to go on stage, Finn begs Rachel to get back together with him, but though she professes her love, she refuses, still torn between her love for New York and Broadway and her love for him. At the end of their duet—"Pretending", written by Finn—an enthusiastic audience falls silent when Rachel and Finn share an overlong, unscripted kiss; the glee club comes in twelfth. Back in Ohio, Finn reminds Rachel that she has a year until graduation and <b>any</b> <b>move</b> to New York; he kisses her, and their relationship resumes.|$|E

25|$|Prove {{whether the}} first player will win, lose or draw from the initial position, given perfect play on both sides. This can be a non-constructive proof (possibly {{involving}} a strategy-stealing argument) that need not actually determine <b>any</b> <b>moves</b> of the perfect play.|$|R

25|$|A player may pass on <b>any</b> <b>move.</b> Usually, passing is {{beneficial}} {{only at the}} end of the game, when all territory has been claimed and further moves would be useless, or even harmful to a player's position.|$|E
25|$|Some sports {{video games}} have {{a version of}} hot hands, where the player will hit <b>any</b> <b>move</b> {{as long as they}} keep scoring. An example of this is NBA Jam, where the ball catches fire during combo streaks.|$|E
60|$|The little cattleman, {{holding the}} men covered, backed {{them out of}} the room, Martin needing a plain, stern word to put him out entirely. I went out, too, for I did not want to miss <b>any</b> <b>moves</b> on the part of that gang.|$|R

25|$|In late March, Ribbentrop had the German chargé d'affaires in Turkey, Hans Kroll, start {{pressuring}} Turkey into {{an alliance}} with Germany. The Turks assured Kroll {{that they had no}} objection to Germany making the Balkans their economic sphere of influence, but would regard <b>any</b> <b>move</b> to make the Balkans into a sphere of German political influence as most unwelcome.|$|E
25|$|These flags never enjoyed much {{popular support}} {{due to the}} animosities {{lingering}} after the Anglo-Boer War. The Afrikaner descendants of the Dutch settlers from the former Boer Republics found the prominent position of the British Union Flag to be offensive while the English-speakers saw <b>any</b> <b>move</b> to remove it as an Afrikaner plot to deprive them of their imperial symbol.|$|E

25|$|Unlike Ferdinand and his Francophile circle, who desired a Romanian {{alliance}} with the Entente {{for the sake of}} union with Transylvania, Tzigara was opposed to <b>any</b> <b>move</b> against Germany. He represented the Germanophile lobby within the University of Bucharest, at the same junior level as another substitute professor, Constantin Litzica. For a while, he was also co-opted on the leadership committee of the Romanian Writers' Society, but lost his seat there in 1915 (probably owing to his presence among the minority of Germanophile writers).|$|E
25|$|In the 1850s, {{as large}} {{plantation}} owners outcompeted smaller farmers, more slaves were owned by fewer planters. Yet poor whites and small farmers generally accepted {{the political leadership}} of the planter elite. Several factors helped explain why slavery was not under serious threat of internal collapse from <b>any</b> <b>move</b> for democratic change initiated from the South. First, given the opening of new territories in the West for white settlement, many non-slaveowners also perceived a possibility that they, too, might own slaves {{at some point in}} their life.|$|E
25|$|The Indian kingdoms of Nagarkot, Thanesar, Kannauj, and Gwalior {{were all}} conquered {{and left in}} the hands of Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist kings as vassal states and he was pragmatic enough not to neglect making alliances and enlisting local peoples into his armies at all ranks. Since Mahmud never kept a {{permanent}} presence in the northwestern subcontinent, he engaged in a policy of destroying Hindu temples and monuments to crush <b>any</b> <b>move</b> by the Hindus to attack the Empire; Nagarkot, Thanesar, Mathura, Kannauj, Kalinjar (1023) and Somnath all submitted or were raided.|$|E
