500|$|In 2004, The Simpsons {{producers}} {{announced that}} one of their characters was {{going to come out of}} the closet.

Despite Matt Groening joking that it would be Homer, the Boston Herald calculated the odds of several characters being gay, with Smithers at a million to one. PlanetOut Inc. hosted an online poll in the weeks prior to the episode to determine based on [...] "cartoon gaydar" [...] who was gay on the Simpsons, with 97% of the respondents choosing Smithers.

Sallal arrested about 140 suspects, including Mohamed Ruwainy, the ex-Minister for Tribal Affairs, and Colonel Hadi Issa, former {{deputy chief of staff}} of the armed forces. Sallal accused Ruwainy and Issa of organizing a [...] "subversive network seeking to plunge the country into terrorism and panic" [...] and planning a campaign of assassination, financed by Saudi Arabia, Britain, Israel and the US. Ruwainy, Issa and five others were executed, while eight others received prison sentences ranging from five years to life.

It was a magnificent final. We knew that they could score goals but that we could also. We needed to keep going but after 63 games it was really difficult." [...] Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard also praised West Ham, stating: [...] "West Ham were brilliant, they gave us a really good game {{but we had a}} never-say-die attitude and we stuck in there, our best chance was on penalties <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not have any energy left." [...] Due {{to the nature of the}} comeback, the match has come to be regarded as The Gerrard Final, teammate Peter Crouch summed up the effect Gerrard had on the match: [...] "When the injury-time board went up we thought our chance had gone, but it is always good to have a player like Steven Gerrard in your team." [...] A BBC Sport poll in May 2015 deemed Gerrard's goal to be the best in an FA Cup Final from the past 50 years.|$|E

[...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "First thing I asked is how many cars on the lead lap, because I wanted to see how bad our day was going to be. I set a goal (of) top 15, and then it was top eight and then top six and, 'Holy cow, we can win this thing.' We just made a heck of a charge at the end."

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} onto eight track tape, which allowed various instruments to be overdubbed. Townshend used several guitars in the studio, but made particular {{use of the}} Gibson J-200 acoustic and the Gibson SG. As well as their usual instruments, Townshend played piano and organ and bassist John Entwistle doubled on french horn. Keith Moon used a new double bass drum kit owned by roadie Tony Haslam, after Premier had refused to loan him any more equipment due to continual abuse. Though Townshend wrote {{the majority of the}} material, the arrangements came from the entire band. Singer Roger Daltrey later said that Townshend often came in with a half-finished demo recording, adding [...] "we probably did as much talking <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> recording, sorting out arrangements and things." [...] Townshend asked Entwistle to write two songs ("Cousin Kevin" [...] and [...] "Fiddle About") that covered the darker themes of bullying and abuse. [...] "Tommy's Holiday Camp" [...] was Moon's suggestion of what religious movement Tommy could lead. Moon got the songwriting credit for suggesting the idea, though the music was composed and played by Townshend. [...] A significant amount of material had a lighter style than earlier recordings, with greater prominence put on the vocals. Moon later said, [...] "It was, at the time, very un-Wholike. A lot of the songs were soft. We never played like that." ...|$|E

[...] That evening, members of the audience accused Eminem of lip syncing, but others defended him of such accusations. The T in the Park performance of [...] "Not Afraid" [...] is included as the second track on the [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] CD single. Eminem performed [...] "Not Afraid" [...] for a small audience in a small room at the beginning of the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards; he performed the song once again at the Los Angeles Nokia Theatre, the main site of the ceremony, and performed [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] with Barbadian singer Rihanna.

500|$|As {{chair of}} the McGovern–Fraser Commission in 1969–70, McGovern instituted major changes in Democratic party rules that {{continue}} to this day and, to a large degree, were ultimately adopted by the Republican Party as well, with large institutional {{changes taking place in}} both. Among those was the centralization of decisions about the nominating process at the national party level, rather than with the states. His 1972 campaign fundamentally altered how presidential primary campaigns were waged. Within the Democratic Party, power shifted from the New Deal coalition to younger, more affluent, issue-oriented activists; the women's movement and gay rights movement found a place; skepticism about military buildups and foreign interventions took hold; and the 1960s [...] "New Politics" [...] found its culmination in McGovern's nomination. In turn, the overwhelming defeat of McGovern in the general election led to the liberal wing of the party's being stigmatized for decades to come and a turn in the party towards centrist directions. McGovern himself recognized the mixed results of his 1972 candidacy, saying, [...] "We made a serious effort to open the doors of the Democratic Party – and as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> half the Democrats walked out." [...] SUNY Albany political scientist Bruce Miroff wrote in 2007 that the McGovern campaign was the last time in presidential politics that liberals had [...] "their chance to speak of their goals with enthusiasm and their dreams with fire... Yet almost at the instant that the insurgents successfully stormed the heights of American politics, they found themselves on the brink of one of the worst free falls on record." ...|$|E

Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts.

When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen.
