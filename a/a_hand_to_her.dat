2500|$|Santos {{is head of}} the Touch A Heart Foundation, {{launched}} in 2004. Her helping hand extends to the indigenous people, which addresses the education and agriculture needs of a community of Aetas in Bataan and provides medical supplies for the hospital in Cuyo Island, Palawan. Bringing her advocacy to the small screen in 2001, she played as an Aeta in Mugu-mugu!'s Maalaala Mo Kaya episode, titled [...] "Basket", to further raise awareness about the plight of the Aeta groups in the country. When it comes to giving <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> colleagues in the business, Santos is a solid provider. Together with director Dante Nico Garcia, they launched the Ploning Foundation in February 2009 to inspire filmmakers to make quality projects intended for a global audience and to impart what the Ploning team learned during their Oscar campaign. It was also reported that Santos plans to work on a housing project to help revive the careers of veteran actors, small-time comedians and action film sidekicks. With so many people needing help in these times of economic hardship, Santos believes the country faces the challenge of leadership.|$|E
6000|$|Her ladyship {{staggered}} {{and flung}} <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> breast. But her recovery was almost immediate. [...] "'Twas a duel--" [...] she began stoutly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was meditating," [...] {{she replied}} coldly, as she {{smoothed}} down her skirts and mechanically put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> hair, lest a curl had gone astray.|$|E
60|$|He {{put forth}} <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> touch <b>her</b> arm, and she drew it {{back as if}} his fingers were of fire.|$|R
60|$|And ere ever a {{man might}} lift <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> stay <b>her</b> Groa glided past the high seat and was gone.|$|R
60|$|This inquiry was {{abruptly}} {{addressed to}} his mother, who, in response, glanced appealingly at Mary and raised <b>a</b> startled <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> smooth hair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I was not," [...] she answered, putting <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> head. [...] "Begin again, {{and let me}} look at {{something}} else. Stay! Now tell me." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{studied his}} face gravely. When {{he held out}} <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> she clung to it desperately and a shudder again shook her from head to foot.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Elizabeth in {{a strange}} voice, and with <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> forehead, {{speaking}} almost as one who repeats a lesson. [...] "No, I do not know him. I know--I do not know him." ...|$|E
6000|$|He sighed; he {{disengaged}} <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> stroke <b>her</b> face. [...] "I am happy," [...] he said, and {{strove to}} smile. [...] "Had I lived, who knows...?" ...|$|R
5000|$|On June 18, 2011, Caldwell was crowned [...] "Queen of Don't H8" [...] at Nashville Pride, <b>a</b> title <b>handed</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{in honor}} of her work with the LGBT community.|$|R
60|$|Even Mrs. Eppingwell's {{lips were}} at last {{set in a}} stony smile, and her eyes, seeing, saw not. Often she stopped, {{pressing}} <b>a</b> mittened <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> heart, gasping and dizzy.|$|R
60|$|He swung off his straw hat, {{and held}} it at his knee as he raised <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and though his {{deference}} was, perhaps, a trifle overdone, it was redeemed by its genuineness, and did not displease her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes.' She pressed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> eyes, {{as if to}} blot out {{the image}} of Stephen. A vivid scarlet spot now shone with preternatural {{brightness}} in the centre of each cheek, leaving the remainder of her face lily-white as before.|$|E
60|$|Cynthia did not faint, {{being made}} of sterner substance. Gently, but with that inexorable {{instinct}} of her kind which compels {{them to look}} for reliance within themselves even in the direst of extremities, Cynthia released herself from Susan's embrace and put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> forehead.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Tommy," [...] said Bax, quietly. [...] "Don't get excited, my lad; lend <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> raise <b>her</b> <b>a</b> bit out o' the water. Now, can {{you hold}} her there for one moment?" ...|$|R
60|$|Aileen's countenance {{assumed a}} troubled look <b>a</b> she <b>handed</b> it <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Be {{careful what}} you say,' replied Nicholas. 'For Heaven's sake be careful! I am left here alone, and those who could stretch out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> rescue <b>her</b> are far away. What {{is it that you}} mean?' ...|$|R
60|$|Left {{alone with}} her mother, Louisa saw her lying with an awful lull upon her face, like one who was {{floating}} away upon some great water, all resistance over, content to be carried down the stream. She put the shadow of <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips again, and recalled her.|$|E
6000|$|... "But--" [...] She stopped, and put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> throat; {{she looked}} as if she would stifle. She sank to her knees beside him, and caught his hand in both her own that were trembling. [...] "Oh, you can't believe it! Captain Tremayne is not the man to do a murder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is naught; it is past," [...] she said. But even as {{she spoke}} she put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> brow. [...] "I am {{something}} dizzy. My condition--" [...] She faltered on a trembling note of appeal that increased their compassion, and aroused in them a shame of their own harshness. [...] "Leave this security with me. I will subscribe it in the morning--indeed, as soon as I am sufficiently recovered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor mother! I'm afraid I'm a--a worry {{to you as}} well as Lorna," [...] he said, gently, with <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> going <b>to</b> <b>her</b> worn cheek. She said nothing, {{although}} her glance rested upon him with sad affection.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thar," [...] said she, {{gathering}} it up, {{and holding}} it, with <b>a</b> trembling <b>hand,</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mistress, [...] "don't {{never want to}} see nor hear on 't again. Jist as I knew 't would be,--sold, and murdered on dem ar' old plantations!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then she's a lying, {{deceitful}} hussy, and she's made {{a fool of}} all of us. I {{give you}} my word of honour that she told us she was married; I'll fetch you the letter.' Mrs Griffith rose from her chair, but Miss Reed put out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The lady's-maid, thus {{suddenly}} {{pulled up}} in a night forage after lovers, put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> forehead {{to show that there}} was no mistake about her having begun to meditate on receiving orders to that effect, and said at last, 'You once told me, ma'am, if you recollect, that when you were dressed, I was not to go staring out of the window after you as if you were a doll I had just manufactured and sent round for sale.' ...|$|E
60|$|Bostil waved <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and Lucy, evidently mistaking his action, came forward, leading {{one of her}} ponies. She wore a gray blouse with a red scarf, and a skirt over {{overalls}} and boots. She looked pale, but she was smiling, {{and there was a}} dark gleam of excitement in her blue eyes. She did not have on her sombrero. She wore her hair in a braid, and had a red band tight above her forehead. Bostil took her in all at a glance. She meant business and she looked dangerous. Bostil knew once she slipped out of that skirt she could ride with any rider there. He saw that she had become the center toward which all eyes shifted. It pleased him. She was his, like her mother, and as beautiful and thoroughbred as any rider could wish his daughter.|$|E
60|$|There was {{need for}} speed, and {{compliments}} were set aside by Garnache, who, at his best, was not felicitous with them. Valerie felt herself {{caught by the}} wrist, a trifle roughly she remembered afterwards, and hurried across the cobbles to the tethered horses, with which Rabecque was already busy. She saw Garnache raise his foot to the stirrup and hoist himself to the saddle. Then he held down <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> bade her set her foot on his, and called with an oath to Rabecque to lend her his assistance. A moment later she was perched in front of Garnache, almost on the withers of his horse. The cobbles rattled under its hooves, the timbers of the drawbridge sent up a booming sound, they were across--out of Condillac--and speeding at a gallop down the white road {{that led to the}} river; after them pounded Rabecque, bumping horribly in his saddle, and attempting wildly, and with awful objurgations, to find his stirrups.|$|E
60|$|He {{flashed a}} glance in the {{direction}} of the divan under the awning where the Basha slept. There all was still. Besides, the question had been asked in English. He rose and held out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> help <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> feet. Then he signed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> reenter the poop-house, and followed her within.|$|R
60|$|Soon the {{persistent}} girl heard a trampling overhead, then <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> beckoned <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and, following directions, {{she went out}} and crossed the inner paved court beyond the gatehouse, her knees trembling {{so that she could}} scarcely walk. One of her arms was out of its sleeve, and only covered by her shawl.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. BRENNAN (plucking at Carmody's elbow. He stands {{looking at}} Eileen helplessly, his mouth open, a guilty flush {{spreading}} over his face). Come out of here, you big fool, you! Is it {{to listen to}} insults to your livin' wife you're waiting? Am I to be tormented and you never raise <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>her?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|Nick forbore from {{delicacy}} to intimate to Biddy that {{he thought}} it a pity she couldn't care for Mr. Grindon; {{but he had a}} private sense that if she had been capable of such a feat it would have lightened a little the weight he himself had to carry. He bore her a slight grudge, which lasted till Julia Dallow came back; when the circumstance of the girl's being summoned immediately down to Harsh created a diversion that was perhaps after all only fanciful. Biddy, as we know, entertained a theory, which Nick had found occasion to combat, that Mrs. Dallow had not treated him perfectly well; therefore in going to Harsh the very first time that relative held out <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> so jealous a little sister must have recognised a special inducement. The inducement might have been that the relative had comfort for her, that she was acting by her cousin's direct advice, that they were still in close communion {{on the question of the}} offers Biddy was not to accept, that in short Peter's sister had taken upon herself to see that their young friend should remain free for the day of the fugitive's inevitable return. Once or twice indeed Nick wondered if Julia had herself been visited, in a larger sense, by the thought of retracing her steps--if she wished to draw out her young friend's opinion as to how she might do that gracefully. During the few days she was in town Nick had seen her twice in Great Stanhope Street, but neither time alone. She had said to him on one of these occasions in her odd, explosive way: [...] "I should have thought you'd have gone away somewhere--it must be such a bore." [...] Of course she firmly believed he was staying for Miriam, which he really was not; and probably she had written this false impression off to Peter, who, still more probably, would prefer to regard it as just. Nick was staying for Miriam only in the sense that he should very glad of the money he might receive for the portrait he was engaged in painting. That money would be a great convenience to him in spite of the obstructive ground Miriam had taken in pretending--she had blown half a gale about it--that he had had no right to dispose of such a production without her consent. His answer to this was simply that the purchaser was so little of a stranger that it didn't go, so to speak, out of the family, out of hers. It didn't matter, Miriam's retort that if Mr. Sherringham had formerly been no stranger he was utterly one now, so that nothing would ever less delight him than to see her hated image on his wall. He would back out of the bargain and Nick be left with the picture on his hands. Nick jeered at this shallow theory and when she came to sit the question served as well as another to sprinkle their familiar silences with chaff. He already knew something, as we have seen, of the conditions in which his distracted kinsman had left England; and this connected itself, in casual meditation, with some of the calculations imputable to Julia and to Biddy. There had naturally been a sequel to the queer behaviour perceptible in Peter, at the theatre, on the eve of his departure--a sequel lighted by a word of Miriam's in the course of her first sitting to Nick after her great night. [...] "Fancy"--so this observation ran--"fancy the dear man finding time in the press of all his last duties to ask me to marry him!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Lady Doverton put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> bosom. [...] "I had not {{considered}} {{the matter in}} that light," [...] she said.|$|E
50|$|Barda and Scott then {{reside in}} the suburbs of Connecticut and are active adventurers. Barda never hesitates to lend <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> friends when her power and {{expertise}} are needed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your trust, fule laddie!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Kennedy. [...] "Ane wad {{think the}} Queen speired of ye {{to carry a}} letter to Mendoza to burn and slay, instead of a bit scart of the pen to ask the good father for his prayers, or the like! But you are all alike; ye will not stir <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> aid <b>her</b> poor soul." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Vandemeyer complied. The brandy {{brought the}} colour back <b>to</b> <b>her</b> white cheeks, and revived {{her in a}} marvellous fashion. She tried to sit up--then fell back with <b>a</b> groan, <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> side.|$|R
6000|$|Doran Lyons in Conway's. She raised <b>a</b> gloved <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> hair. In came Hoppy. Having a wet. Drawing {{back his}} head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums. Clearly I can see today. Moisture about gives long sight perhaps. Talking of one thing or another. Lady's hand. Which side will she get up? ...|$|R
