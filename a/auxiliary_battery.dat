[...] Thus, if electrical power was lost on the ship in general, the wireless would also go down. [...] This happened on May when the engine room flooded. [...] The wireless operator, W.R. Keller, did not have time to send out a distress call before the main power was lost. [...] Thinking quickly, he ran down to the engine room, where the incoming water was by then waist deep. [...] Keller rigged an improvised electrical connection with the engine room telegraph battery, and using this was able to send out a wireless distress call before the engine room was completely flooded. [...] The message sent by Keller stated: “S.S. PRINCESS MAY SINKING SENTINEL ISLAND; SEND HELP.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Nissan Leaf employs an {{advanced}} telematics system called CarWings which originally was only available in Japan. The system sends and receives data via a built-in GPRS radio {{similar to the}} connectivity of mobile phones. [...] Carwings is connected any time the car is in range of a cell tower and it makes possible several user functionalities, such as position and possible range on a map and which charging stations are available within range. The system also tracks and compiles statistics about distance traveled and energy consumption and produces daily, monthly and annual reports of these and several other operational parameters. All information {{is available in the}} Leaf's digital screens. [...] Through a smart phone application or secure web page, owners can remotely turn on the air-conditioner or heater as well as reset charging functions even when the vehicle is powered down. This remote functionality can be used to pre-heat or pre-cool the car prior to use while it is still charging so that less energy from the battery is used for climate control. [...] An on-board timer can also be pre-programmed to recharge batteries at a set time such as during off-peak rates. The Leaf's SL trim has a small solar panel {{at the rear of the}} roof/spoiler that can trickle charge the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battery.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 25 January 2004, {{telemetry}} {{from the}} main battery was observed {{to go to an}} extremely low voltage by Stacey Mills (amateur radio call sign W4SM), a member of the Command Team. This caused the onboard Internal Housekeeping Unit (IHU) computer to cut power to the transponder payloads. Just prior to the loss of control of the satellite, the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battery</b> came online in parallel with the main battery. When the main battery failed, it effectively short-circuited the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battery,</b> killing the spacecraft. Many attempts were made to disconnect the main battery, but insufficient voltage was available to drive the relays. One day an open-circuit failure may occur in the main battery, in which case the spacecraft may come to life again. Though the command team believe that the main battery failure was probably a consequence of damage done during the event, and it is likely that similar damage was done to the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battery,</b> making an eventual recovery of AO-40 unlikely.|$|E
50|$|Now let us {{assume that}} the power outage hits at T+0.5. The RPS is on a float {{uninterruptable}} power supply, so it continues to function; its sensors, however, are not, and thus the RPS assumes {{that they are all}} detecting emergency conditions. Within less than a second from power outage, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>batteries</b> and compressed air supplies are starting the Emergency Diesel Generators. Power will be restored by T+25 seconds.|$|R
50|$|Silent {{watch is}} {{becoming}} an increasingly important combat vehicle application. It is a role that requires that all mission requirements be met while keeping acoustic and infrared signature levels to a minimum. For this reason, silent watch often requires the vehicle to operate without use of the main engine and sometimes even auxiliary engines. Many modern combat vehicles often have electronic equipment that cannot be supported solely with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>batteries</b> alone. <b>Auxiliary</b> fuel cells are a potential solution for covert operations.|$|R
5|$|The {{introduction}} of shell guns and steam {{ships in the}} 1840s created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast. In 1850, with {{the closure of the}} prison, seven 8-inch (22.3 cm) guns were mounted along the walls in brick emplacements, but there were concerns about the defences and two earthwork <b>auxiliary</b> <b>batteries</b> were built just alongside the castle to house additional guns. In 1856, {{at the end of the}} Crimean War, there was a large review of the fleet along the Solent, attended by Queen Victoria and numerous tourists. Naval gunboats launched a mock attack on the castle, which responded by firing a volley of forty 8-inch guns, causing chaos among the crowds watching around the base of the fortification.|$|R
50|$|Battery {{isolators}} {{are commonly}} used on recreational vehicles, boats, utility vehicles, airplanes, and large trucks where one battery is dedicated to starting and running the engine and another battery or batteries run accessory loads (e.g., winches, radar, instruments, etc.). A battery isolator helps {{to ensure that the}} starting battery has sufficient power to start the engine and recharge the batteries if, for example, loads on the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battery</b> (e.g., refrigerator or navigation lights) cause it to be drained, or if an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battery</b> fails. Isolators are also used in vehicles with large, high-power car stereos and off road vehicles to accommodate high current loads such as a recovery winch.|$|E

5000|$|In the mid-1990s, {{the outlook}} for the {{trolleybus}} system improved greatly, as a plan (known as the [...] "Husler Plan", after its editor, the Swiss engineer Willi Husler) was prepared for the reform of the entire system. It provided for upgrades and extensions, and the opportunity was taken to rebuild the system to the most modern dictates, by reconstructing the overhead wire to make it suitable for higher speeds, and increasing the voltage from 600 V to 750 V.All of these extensive works necessitated the suspension of all trolleybus service from 30 October 1995 until May 2000. In addition to the infrastructure upgrade and expansion, fleet improvements were also approved. ATCM placed an order for 10 new articulated, low-floor trolleybuses with Modena-based Autodromo (with MAN chassis), and also made plans to refurbish the 14 Socimi vehicles, which needed modification {{to enable them to}} operate at the planned higher voltage. The Socimi trolleybuses were also fitted with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>batteries</b> permitting limited movement away from the overhead trolley wiring. [...] The first Autodromo vehicle was delivered in spring 1999.|$|R
5000|$|A {{machinery}} compartment {{behind each}} cab housed auxiliary gear such as two motor generator sets, one of [...] {{and the other}} of , each coupled to a blower fan on its shaft for ventilating the main motors.

5000|$|To power their massive frames, {{they use}} {{internal}} batteries, an umbilical cable, or an S² engine. <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>batteries</b> can {{be attached to}} extend an Eva's unplugged endurance. The Evas are controlled through their psychic link to the pilot via a combination of hand controls in the entry plug and direct nerve impulses that link to the pilot's plug suit and interface headset. The pilot's link with the Eva is expressed in a [...] "synchronization ratio". The higher the synchronization, the greater the command over the Eva. A high synchronization permits direct feedback, including the ability for a pilot to directly experience pain induced by any damage against the Eva. This {{is the reason why}} the pilots often undergo routine synchronization tests, in order to measure how well the pilots are able to synchronize with the souls that are bonded within the Evas. The Evas can also be controlled by an autopilot system, the Dummy Plugs, which are based on the thought patterns of either Rei Ayanami or Kaworu Nagisa. Evas can also lose control in certain circumstances and go [...] "berserk", such as when the pilot is under extreme stress.|$|R

50|$|Flooded {{lead-acid}} {{batteries are}} the cheapest and in past most common traction batteries available. There {{are two main}} types of lead-acid batteries: automobile engine starter batteries, and deep cycle batteries. Automobile alternators are designed to provide starter batteries high charge rates for fast charges, while deep cycle batteries used for electric vehicles like forklifts or golf carts, and as the <b>auxiliary</b> house <b>batteries</b> in RV's, require different multi-stage charging. No lead acid battery should be discharged below 50% of its capacity, as it shortens the battery's life. Flooded batteries require inspection of electrolyte level and occasional replacement of water which gases away during the normal charging cycle.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the main battery, the Leaf also has an <b>auxiliary</b> 12-volt lead–acid <b>battery</b> that provides power to the car computer systems and accessories such as the audio system, supplemental restraint systems, headlights and windshield wipers.

50|$|Also {{starting}} with Apollo 14, a 400 Ah <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battery</b> {{was added to}} the SM for emergency use. Apollo 13 had drawn heavily on its entry batteries in the first hours after the explosion, and while this new battery could not power the CM for more than 5-10 hours it would buy time {{in the event of a}} temporary loss of all three fuel cells. Such an event occurred when Apollo 12 was struck twice by lightning during launch.|$|E
50|$|The Chairiot solo {{is powered}} twin hub motors rated at 3 kW each {{built into the}} rear wheels. A 48 volt AGM battery pack with a nominal {{capacity}} of 7.5 kW provides propulsive power; a 12 volt <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battery</b> is kept charged by the main pack and supplies power for the vehicle's electrical accessories. In {{the event of a}} motor failure, the Chairiot can continue to be driven on just one motor. The energy-efficient design provides a range of 40 to 50 miles on a full charge. During EPA urban cycle testing, the Chairiot solo achieved a fuel efficiency of 157 MPGe.|$|E
5000|$|In 1977 Jeffery [...] {{experimented with}} an {{oscillating}} aerofoil {{system based on}} a vertically mounted pivoting wing which flapped in the wind. Farthing discovered that this free flutter could automatically cease for high wind protection and developed floating and pile based models for pumping surface and well water as well as compressing air with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>battery</b> charging. McKinney and DeLaurier [...] in 1981 proposed a system called wingmill, based on a rigid horizontal airfoil with articulated pitching and plunging to extract energy from the flow. This system has stimulated Moores in 2003 to conduct further investigations on applications of such idea.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the concept of ‘‘more {{electric}} aircrafts” has established itself increasingly and the electri- cal power systems for aircrafts are in progress. In this context, fuel cells represent a valid source of elec- tric power for the advantages in terms of pollution emissions, noise reduction and fuel consumptions. In this study, the authors analyzed the feasibility, from the specific energy point of view, in using a PEM fuel cell power system as APU unit in a more electrical aircraft {{with respect to a}} battery system installa- tion. The proposed fuel cell system has a modular architecture and consists of fuel cell stacks, air com- pressors, heat exchangers, compressed hydrogen tanks and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>batteries.</b> The analysis has been performed by applying a design methodology based on an optimization proce- dure concerning the size and the efficiency of each power system component in order to reach the max- imum specific energy (higher than 500 W h/kg). Moreover, a ‘‘black-box”-type model of the power system has been developed to support the optimiza- tion methodology in the evaluation of its performance in terms of electric power production, heat pro- duction, auxiliary systems consumption and hydrogen consumption. Results pointed out the advantages of the PEM fuel cell application in a more electric aircraft; as a mat- ter of fact for assigned mission requirements, according to the specifications defined in the Long Endurance Demonstrator (LED) project promoted by CIRA (Italian Aerospace Research Centre), the speci- fic energy of the designed power system results to be equal to 0. 51 kW h/kg. This value is very interesting if compared to the specific energy of commercial LiPo batteries characterized by 0. 2 kW h/kg...|$|R
50|$|Unlike other hybrid {{models in}} the market, the Ioniq {{does not have a}} {{lead-acid}} <b>auxiliary</b> 12 V <b>battery,</b> resulting in an approximate 26 lb reduction in weight. With higher usage of lightweight components and a more compact build, the cargo-screen cover is about 25% lighter than the types used in other Hyundai models. The Ioniq uses aluminum in the hood and tailgate, reducing weight by 27 lb compared with conventional steel and no measurable disadvantages in noise or vibration.|$|R
30|$|Exciting of {{the phase}} current is a {{necessary}} starting step for the SRG. The excitation process produces an output current {{in proportion to the}} voltage of an <b>auxiliary</b> excitation <b>battery.</b> The output current is restrained by the maximum allowed current value. In order to fully utilize the SRG windings, it is important to maintain the winding current in the negative inductance slope region at all times. Further, in the proposed system, the SRG rotates with low velocity, so the electromotive force will be relatively small. In addition, the windings are used as part of the rapid charging circuit. In this situation, CCC is the best control method for the SRG. Current flowing in the conducting phase is restrained by the reference current, which determines the generator torque. Since the ability to capture wave energy is closely related to the electromagnetic torque, it is important to set an appropriate reference current to realize the system’s maximum power point tracking ability.|$|R
