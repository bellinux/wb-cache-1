5|$|Egypt {{invaded the}} newly {{declared}} State of Israel on May 15, 1948. Their strength was approximately one division, commanded by Major General Ahmed Ali al-Mwawi. Their advance was three-pronged: The main column moved north through what is today the Gaza Strip and <b>attacked</b> Kfar Darom, another column went east toward Beersheba, {{and a third}} <b>attacked</b> kibbutz Nirim. On May 17, a small force split off from Beersheba to link up with more Egyptian forces at Auja al-Hafir, on May 19 the main column <b>attacked</b> Yad Mordechai, and on May 20, the main force in Beersheba set out to link with the Jordanian Arab Legion in Hebron.|$|E

50|$|Two {{other type}} of battle system exist: duel battles and war battles. Both duel battles and {{strategic}} war battles are analogous to Rock, Paper, Scissors. In one-on-one duels, there are three commands: <b>attack,</b> defend and special. <b>Attack</b> beats defend, defend beats special and special beats <b>attack.</b> In strategic war battles, the four major groups are charge <b>attacks,</b> bow <b>attacks,</b> magic <b>attacks</b> and others. Charge <b>attacks</b> beat bow <b>attacks,</b> bow <b>attacks</b> beat magic <b>attacks</b> and magic <b>attacks</b> beat charge <b>attacks.</b> The 'other' command acts as a free special command enabling you to for example, learn what the enemy's next <b>attack</b> will be.|$|R
50|$|You {{can also}} <b>attack</b> your co-players towers using attack-cards. They {{can be one}} of {{throwing}} <b>attack,</b> hand <b>attack</b> and sneak <b>attack.</b> Throwing <b>attacks</b> can <b>attack</b> at any height. Hand <b>attack</b> can <b>attack</b> only at the same height as you are and sneak <b>attacks</b> is a catch-all for other types of <b>attacks.</b> The co-player can defend himself using defense-cards. There are also special-cards which can affect the game in various ways.|$|R
30|$|None of the <b>attacks</b> {{discussed}} in Section 2.3, nor the MX <b>attack,</b> are effective against the preprocessor.

5|$|In 1700 Sweden was <b>attacked</b> by a {{coalition}} of Saxony, Russia, and Denmark–Norway. Saxony, under Augustus II, invaded Swedish oversea dominions in Livonia and quickly <b>attacked</b> the city of Riga. Meanwhile, Frederick IV of Denmark <b>attacked</b> the Swedish allied duchies of Holstein and Gottorp in order to secure his rear, before commencing with the planned invasion of Scania, which had been previously annexed by Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. A short time later, Russia under Peter I swept into Swedish Ingria and besieged the strategic city of Narva. Unprepared for these developments, the Swedes were forced into a war on three fronts.|$|E
5|$|In May 227 BC, Aratus {{was once}} again elected strategos and <b>attacked</b> Elis.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the method}} of {{modeling}} <b>attack</b> using <b>attack</b> tree is researched. The main goal is effectively using <b>attack</b> tree to model and express multi-stage network <b>attacks.</b> We expand and improve the traditional <b>attack</b> tree. The <b>attack</b> nodes in traditional <b>attack</b> tree are redefined, and the <b>attack</b> risk of leaf node is quantified. On those basis, the mentality and method of building MLL-AT (Multi-Level & Layer <b>Attack</b> Tree) are proposed. The improved <b>attack</b> tree can model <b>attack</b> more accurately, in particular to multi-stage network <b>attacks.</b> And the new model {{can also be used}} to evaluate system's risk, to distinguish between varying system security threat degrees caused by different <b>attack</b> sequences...|$|R
50|$|The normal <b>attacks</b> roughly {{correspond}} to standard Toshinden <b>attacks.</b> There {{is a hard}} <b>attack,</b> light <b>attack,</b> low <b>attack</b> and either a medium or 360 degree <b>attack</b> (depending on the character).

Following the disqualification, Big Daddy V <b>attacked</b> CM Punk.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1920, Alexander {{was injured}} while {{walking through the}} grounds of the Tatoi estate. A {{domestic}} Barbary macaque belonging to the steward of the palace's grapevines <b>attacked</b> or was <b>attacked</b> by the king's German Shepherd Dog, Fritz, and Alexander attempted to separate the two animals. As he did so, another monkey <b>attacked</b> Alexander and bit him deeply on the leg and torso. Eventually servants arrived and chased away the monkeys, and the king's wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not cauterized. He did not consider the incident serious and asked that it not be publicized.|$|E

5|$|On 22 and 23 September {{small groups}} of soldiers, {{remnants}} of the Yildirim Army Group, were <b>attacked</b> by aircraft on the Shibleh to Beisan road near the Jordan River. Shortly afterwards a column of several thousand Ottoman soldiers were seen marching back under a white flag along the Wady el Fara road. Meanwhile, east of the Jordan River, three German Pfalz scout aircraft {{and a number of}} D.F.W. two–seater aircraft from Deraa aerodrome were <b>attacked</b> by three Bristol Fighters over Um es Surab. During the aerial fight a German two–seater was shot down near Mafrak, another aircraft was forced to land near the railway and an Ottoman outpost, while the third aircraft was chased back to Deraa. Deraa aerodrome was <b>attacked</b> in the early morning of 23 September, by aircraft flying from Ramle. It was <b>attacked</b> again that night by the Handley-Page, which ended the enemy's use of that aerodrome.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September, {{the first}} bombing {{formation}} <b>attacked,</b> expending {{large amounts of}} munitions on the retreating columns on the Es Salt to Amman road, returning about 07:00 when a rout resulted. Amman was <b>attacked</b> from the air {{during the day and}} retreating columns from Amman and another column moving from Es Salt to Amman were <b>attacked.</b> An Australian aircraft saw columns retreating from Deraa and Samakh, where trains appeared ready to leave for Damascus. By the afternoon of 24 September, virtually all the area west of Amman was clear of Ottoman soldiers but on 25 September a column moving from Amman was seen at Mafrak. The column was <b>attacked</b> between 6:00 and 08:00 by ten Australian aircraft, with attacks continuing throughout the day expending four tons of bombs and almost 20,000 machine gun rounds.|$|E
5|$|On February 6, 2014, Angle had a {{match against}} Magnus. However, he won by disqualification, when EC3 <b>attacked</b> him {{performing}} a leglock, which injured his knee.

30|$|<b>Attack</b> {{detection}} ratio: It is {{the rate}} at which the spoofing <b>attacks</b> and the flooding <b>attacks</b> are detected. When the network size increases the percentage of local IPDS increases which leads to the increase in <b>attack</b> detection ratio. Once the spoofing <b>attacks</b> are detected, the flooding <b>attacks</b> are detected easily in a timely manner. Figure 10 shows the <b>attack</b> detection ratio of the ColShield system with respect to the percentage of local IPDS in the WMN. The <b>attack</b> detection ratio calculates the percentage of spoofing <b>attack</b> detected by the system while running the bandwidth allocation process and the timer monitor protocol. The <b>attack</b> detection ratio also calculates the percentage of flooding <b>attacks</b> detected by the system while running the bandwidth monitor protocol. The <b>attack</b> detection ratio for spoofing <b>attack</b> and flooding <b>attack</b> is reasonably good which is the goal of the ColShield System.|$|R
