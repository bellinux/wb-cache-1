5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the battle for the Donets, as the spring rasputitsa (mud) season came to an end in 1943, both the German and Soviet commands considered their plans for future operations. The Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and some senior Soviet officers wanted to seize the initiative first and attack the German forces inside the Soviet Union, but they were convinced by a number of key commanders, including the Deputy Supreme Commander Georgiy Zhukov, to assume a defensive posture instead. This would allow the German side to weaken themselves in attacking prepared positions, after which the Soviet forces would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> with a counter-offensive.|$|E

5|$|In {{the city}} of Puerto Cabezas, {{population}} 60,000, meteorologists expected a direct hit. Local authorities announced a curfew to prevent looting. The government also cut off electricity throughout the small coastal city to prevent injuries. Evacuations were limited, and the most vulnerable of the population weathered the storm in poorly constructed shelters. To be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to an emergency following Beta, the government of Nicaragua requested relief supplies for 41,866 families which would last 15 days. These supplies consisted of 98,000lb (44,452kg) of cereals, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of beans, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of corn, 125,7200lb (57,025kg) of rice, 44,500lb (20,184kg) of sugar, 171,600lb (77,836kg) of salt, 4,929gal (18,658L) of cooking oil, 324,900lb (147,372kg) of milk and 21,264 blankets.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October, an NVA {{regiment}} attacked an Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) battalion at Song Be, {{capital of}} Phuoc Long Province. The North Vietnamese fought for several days, took casualties, and fell back.

5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and his entourage of chiefs should dismount and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he would {{have no way of knowing}} what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was likely in the gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E
5|$|The first cacti {{are thought}} to have been only {{slightly}} succulent shrubs or small trees whose leaves carried out photosynthesis. They lived in tropical areas that experienced periodic drought. If Pereskia clade A is a good model of these early cacti, then, although they would have appeared superficially similar to other trees growing nearby, they had already evolved strategies to conserve water (some of which are present in members of other families in the order Caryophyllales). These strategies included being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> rapidly to periods of rain, and keeping transpiration low by using water very efficiently during photosynthesis. The latter was achieved by tightly controlling the opening of stomata. Like Pereskia species today, early ancestors may have been able to switch from the normal C3 mechanism, where carbon dioxide is used continuously in photosynthesis, to CAM cycling, in which when the stomata are closed, carbon dioxide produced by respiration is stored for later use in photosynthesis.|$|E

5|$|A {{receptor}} for tomato systemin {{was identified}} as a 160KDa leucine-rich repeat receptor like kinase (LRR-RLK), SR160. After being isolated it was found that was very similar in structure to BRI1 from A. thaliana, the receptor that brassinolides bind to on the cell membrane. This was the first receptor which was found to be able to bind both a steroid and a peptide ligand and also to be involved in both defensive and developmental responses. Recent studies have found that the initial conclusion that BRI1 is the receptor for tomato systemin may be incorrect. In cu3 mutants of tomato, a null allele with a stop codon present in the extracellular LRR domain of BRI1 prevents the receptor from being localised correctly and it also lacks the kinase domain, required for signalling. These mutants are insensitive to brassinolide yet still respond to tomato systemin by producing protease inhibitors and causing an alkalisation response. This led Holton et al. to suggest that there is another mechanism by which systemin is perceived. Further investigation showed that binding of systemin to BRI1 does not cause the receptor to become phosphorylated, as when brassinolides bind, suggesting that it does not transduce a signal. When BRI1 is silenced in tomato, the plants have a similar phenotype to cu3 mutants yet are still <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> normally to systemin, strengthening the view that BRI1 is not the systemin receptor.|$|E
5|$|Since Deep Blue's {{victory over}} Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997, IBM {{had been on}} the hunt for a new challenge. In 2004, IBM Research manager Charles Lickel, over dinner with coworkers, noticed that the {{restaurant}} they were in had fallen silent. He soon discovered the cause of this evening hiatus: Ken Jennings, who was then {{in the middle of his}} successful 74-game run on Jeopardy!. Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions, mid-meal, to watch the phenomenon. Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM, Lickel passed the idea on, and in 2005, IBM Research executive Paul Horn backed Lickel up, pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing Jeopardy! with an IBM system. Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess, eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer. In competitions managed by the United States government, Watson's predecessor, a system named Piquant, was usually <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> correctly to only about 35% of clues and often required several minutes to respond. To compete successfully on Jeopardy!, Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds, and at that time, the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{withdrawal}} from Vietnam brought {{to an end}} the doctrine of 'forward defence' through involvement in Southeast Asian wars. Instead, the Australian military's new focus was on the defence of continental Australia against external attack. In line with this change, the SASR {{took the lead in}} developing the Australian Army's capability to conduct patrol operations in Northern Australia. It was later recognised that this role required dedicated units with the Army forming three Regional Force Surveillance Units in the early 1980s trained by the SASR. In July 1977 two SASR patrols were deployed to north Irian Jaya with the approval of Indonesian authorities to provide first aid to the survivors of an RAAF Iroquois helicopter which had crashed in the remote jungle during survey operations, and to secure the wreckage from possibly being captured by members of the OPM independence movement. During this time the SASR also continued to train overseas with other special forces units. On one such exercise in the Philippines, a US special forces C-130 Hercules crashed into the South China Sea shortly after take-off from Subic Bay on 26 February 1981, killing 23 passengers including three Australians from the SASR, {{as well as a number}} of Americans, Filipinos, and New Zealanders. Meanwhile, following the Sydney Hilton bombing in February 1978, the SASR was given responsibility for providing Australia's military counter-terrorism response force, for which 2 Squadron was raised again in 1982. In addition to being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to terrorist attacks in Australian cities, the SASR counter-terrorism unit was required to develop a capability to board ships underway and off-shore oil platforms together with clearance divers from the Navy Clearance Diving Branch. In May 1987 a squadron from the SASR was alerted for a possible deployment to Fiji as part of Operation Morris Dance, but did not leave Australia. The regiment was not involved in operations during the Gulf War in 1991 although two troops were again placed on standby for deployment at short notice, while other elements remained on high alert to respond to a terrorist incident in Australia if required.|$|E

5|$|With the Grande Armée in full retreat, another {{dangerous}} situation occurred on 29 October. With Bavaria now {{also in the}} camp of the Coalition, an Austro-Bavarian army of some 45,000 men, under General Karl Philipp von Wrede, who had fought {{under the command of}} the Emperor during the previous campaigns, tried to block the French retreat and delay the French force until the arrival {{of the rest of the}} Coalition forces. Wrede had the means necessary to achieve his goal, as he possessed a numerous artillery of about one hundred pieces and a powerful cavalry of 50 squadrons. In comparison, the French forces were much dispersed and only a few units remained cohesive and combat-capable. During the ensuing Battle of Hanau, Wrede placed his troops in front of the forest of Lamboi, through which he expected that the French would retreat. He also positioned almost all of his cavalry on the left, placing it under the command of Field Marshal-Lieutenant Spleny. Despite his numeric inferiority, Napoleon sent forward a part of his men against Bavarians deployed in the forest before him, but the intervention of the Foot Guards was soon required. The Bavarians had fought alongside the French in the past and the sight of the fearsome Bearskins of French Guardsmen shook their morale and they abandoned their position in the forest after a brief fight. But, with the fire of a Bavarian grand battery upon them, the French infantry soon had to stop. Napoleon positioned General Le Noury's artillery in battery and brought in support General Drouot with the horse artillery of the Guard, as well as other pieces, constituting a grand battery of some 50 pieces that was soon <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> adequately to the Austro-Bavarian cannonade. Nansouty, with the Guard Dragoons and Lancers, was instructed to protect this battery from the enemy and thus positioned his men behind the guns.|$|E
