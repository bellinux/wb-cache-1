The first types to go were non-clear (frosted) bulbs, which were taken off the market in September 2009. Also from September 2009 clear bulbs over 100 W were made of more efficient types.

2500|$|... "Retroreflectors" [...] (also [...] "reflex reflectors") produce {{no light}} of their own, but rather reflect {{incident}} light back towards its source, for example, another driver's headlight. They are regulated as <b>automotive</b> <b>lighting</b> devices, and specified {{to account for the}} separation between a vehicle's headlamps and its driver's eyes. Thus, vehicles are conspicuous even when their lights are off. Regulations worldwide require each vehicle to be equipped with rear-facing red retroreflectors. Since 1968 US regulations also require side-facing retroreflectors, amber in front and red in the rear. Sweden, South Africa and other countries have at various times required white front-facing retroreflectors.|$|E

2500|$|The {{incandescent}} light bulb was long the light source used in all <b>automotive</b> <b>lighting</b> devices. Many types of bulbs have been used. Standardized type numbers are used by manufacturers to identify bulbs with the same specifications.

Screw-base lamps are never used in automobile applications due to their loosening under vibration. [...] Signal lamps with internal or external coloured lenses use colourless bulbs; conversely, lamps with colourless lenses may use red or amber bulbs to provide light of the required colours for the various functions.|$|E
2500|$|As well {{as being}} sold in the North American market, third-generation models were {{imported}} to many other countries, in left and right-hand drive configurations. However, this action proved unsuccessful. Exported models wore Mercury Sable headlamps, a unique front bumper cover to conform to these countries' regulations regarding <b>automotive</b> <b>lighting.</b> Right-hand-drive versions used a hand-operated parking brake in the center console instead of a foot-operated parking brake as in North America. Australians tended {{to stay away from}} the cars, due to their high price; a well-equipped, larger-engined rear-wheel drive Ford Fairmont cost around the same amount. Australian buyers could only opt for a single-spec sedan, known as the Taurus Ghia. However, in New Zealand the Taurus was quite popular. Whereas Australia only saw the 1996 model, both the sedan and station wagon models were sold in New Zealand from 1996-1998.|$|E
2500|$|LEDs {{were first}} applied to <b>automotive</b> <b>lighting</b> in centre high-mount stop lamps (CHMSL), {{beginning}} with the 1984 Chevrolet Corvette. Adoption of LEDs for other signal functions on passenger cars is gradually increasing with demand for the technology and related styling updates. In North America, the 2000 Cadillac Deville was the first passenger car with LED taillights. The 2002 Kia Opirus/Amanti was an early adopter of LED front turn signals. The 2007 Audi R8 sports car uses two strips of optically focused high-intensity LEDs for its daytime running lamps. Optional on the R8 outside North America was the world's first LED headlamp, made by AL-Automotive Lighting. The low and high beams, along with the position (parking) lamp and front turn signal, are all realised with LEDs. [...] The Lexus LS 600h features LED low beam, position and side marker lamps in North America, and the 2009 Cadillac Escalade Platinum uses LEDs for the low and high beams, {{as well as for}} the position and side marker lamps. The Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) has no non-LED lamps at all, not even in the most basic trim level.|$|E

40|$|As the {{automotive}} industry becomes increasingly competitive, parts manufacturers are under extreme pressure {{to improve the quality}} of their parts, while at the same time reducing costs. The method currently used to detect failures in <b>automotive</b> <b>light</b> assemblies after vibration endurance testing involves manual inspection only after the test is completed. An adaptable, reliable and low cost real time monitoring and diagnostic system that would interrupt the testing operation at the first onset of a failure is desired. This thesis describes accelerometer based, microphone (single and dual-microphone) based and acoustic emission sensor based monitoring systems for <b>automotive</b> <b>light</b> assembly failure detection during endurance testing. Preliminary results from accelerometer based and dual-microphone based diagnostic systems show that significant differences between healthy and faulty fog light assemblies can be detected. Based on these initial testing results, subsequent testing and data analysis were conducted for accelerometer based and dual microphone based systems. Four data analysis methods have been used: (1) Averaging signals in the time domain, (2) FFT of time domain waveforms over a specified time, (3) Averaging frequency spectra, and (4) Statistical methods for time domain signals. Individual frequency spectra (from FFT) and the average of multiple frequency spectra have shown potential to distinguish between signals from faulty and healthy light assemblies. Statistical measures, such as, Arithmetic mean (µ) and Kurtosis (K) can also be used to differentiate healthy and faulty light assemblies. In general, this work has shown the good potential to develop methods for adaptable, reliable and low cost real time monitoring and diagnostic systems that would interrupt the testing operation at the first onset of a failure. i...|$|R
