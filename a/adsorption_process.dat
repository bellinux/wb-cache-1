40|$|Due to high {{regeneration}} energy {{demands for}} amine absorption processes for post-combustion CO 2 capture, alternative {{technologies such as}} <b>adsorption</b> <b>processes</b> using solid adsorbents have been considered. Other practical issues such as corrosion of equipment and loss of solvent can be avoided with <b>adsorption</b> <b>processes.</b> Fixed bed <b>adsorption</b> <b>processes,</b> in which CO 2 adsorption and adsorbent regeneration are performed successively in a vessel packed with adsorbent, {{are the most common}} <b>adsorption</b> <b>processes.</b> However, in fixed bed temperature swing <b>adsorption</b> (TSA) <b>processes,</b> large columns and long heating and cooling times would be needed. Fixed bed pressure swing <b>adsorption</b> (PSA) <b>processes</b> use electrical energy, which is more expensive than thermal energy in a power plant. Therefore, the feasibility of moving bed <b>adsorption</b> <b>processes</b> including fluidised-bed, co-current and counter-current systems is investigated. In these systems, the adsorbent continuously circulates from a CO 2 adsorber to a regenerator. The adsorbents considered are a supported amine adsorbent, activated carbon and zeolite 13 X. Numerical simulations of moving bed TSA cycles for CO 2 capture have been carried out. The effects of influential parameters in the process have been assessed via sensitivity analyses. It was found that counter-current beds with supported amine adsorbent give the best overall performance. Compared to an amine absorption process, it was found that a moving bed TSA process without heat integration requires the same heat consumption per unit mass of CO 2 captured. There is a potential for a lower heat consumption in moving bed TSA processes if, similarly to amine absorption processes, heat integration is carried out or if the CO 2 working capacity of the adsorbent can be increased...|$|R
25|$|Whereas the Iron–sulfur world {{identifies}} {{a circular}} pathway {{as the most}} simple, the thermosynthesis hypothesis does not even invoke a pathway: ATP synthase's binding change mechanism resembles a physical <b>adsorption</b> <b>process</b> that yields free energy, rather than a regular enzyme's mechanism, which decreases the free energy.

25|$|Similar {{to surface}} tension, {{adsorption}} {{is a consequence}} of surface energy. In a bulk material, all the bonding requirements (be they ionic, covalent or metallic) of the constituent atoms of the material are filled by other atoms in the material. However, atoms {{on the surface of the}} adsorbent are not wholly surrounded by other adsorbent atoms and therefore can attract adsorbates. The exact nature of the bonding depends on the details of the species involved, but the <b>adsorption</b> <b>process</b> is generally classified as physisorption (characteristic of weak van der Waals forces) or chemisorption (characteristic of covalent bonding). It may also occur due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E
2500|$|In {{subterranean}} arsenic removal (SAR), aerated groundwater is recharged {{back into}} the aquifer to create an oxidation zone which can trap iron and arsenic on the soil particles through <b>adsorption</b> <b>process.</b> The oxidation zone created by aerated water boosts {{the activity of the}} arsenic-oxidizing microorganisms which can oxidize arsenic from +3 to +5 state [...] No chemicals are used and almost no sludge is produced during operational stage since iron and arsenic compounds are rendered inactive in the aquifer itself. Thus toxic waste disposal and the risk of its future mobilization is prevented. Also, it has very long operational life, similar to the long lasting tube wells drawing water from the shallow aquifers.|$|E

50|$|The swing <b>adsorption</b> <b>process</b> {{in each of}} the two adsorbers {{consists}} of two stages running for a few minutes. At the adsorption stage oxygen, H2O and CO2 molecules diffuse into the pore structure of the adsorbent whilst the nitrogen molecules are allowed to travel through the adsorber-adsorbent-containing vessel.
