50|$|Place the flour, baking powder, {{salt and}} mace {{in a medium}} bowl. Stir with a wire whisk to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl of an {{electric}} mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs <b>and</b> <b>mix</b> <b>until</b> creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fastnachts.|$|E

50|$|Khoa {{is made by}} {{simmering}} full-fat milk in an iron karahi {{for several}} hours, over a medium fire. The gradual vaporization of its water content leaves coagulated solids in milk, which is khoa. The ideal temperature to avoid scorching is about 80 C.

30|$|Other {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to analyze the molecular weight distribution of the compounds solubilized in [C 2 mim][Cl]. After starting the treatment of cellulose with [C 2 mim][Cl] as described above, 125  μl of the reaction medium was withdrawn at a specified reaction time. To this sampled reaction medium, 125  μl of DMSO was added <b>and</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>until</b> homogeneous. The mixture was filtered through a 0.45 -μm filter, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was carried out on the filtrate. GPC conditions were column, Shodex SB- 803 HQ; flow rate, 0.3  ml/min; eluent, DMSO; detectors, refractive index detector (RID) and ultraviolet–visible (UV) detector set at 280  nm; column temperature, 60  °C.

The compounds solubilized in [C 2 mim][Cl] were also analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The samples for this analysis were prepared as follows: at a specified reaction time, 20  μl of the reaction medium was homogeneously mixed with 180  μl of distilled water and then filtered through a 0.45  μm filter.

30|$|Azide {{modification}} method {{based on}} the guidelines provided in APHA et al. (2005) is employed to measure the quantity of oxygen dissolved in the tank water. The reagents are prepared as per the directions given in APHA et al. (2005). Three representative samples of testing water are collected in 300 -mL BOD bottles: two samples containing the aerated water after running the aerator for 1  min, and other sample containing the testing water prior to each test run. The measurement procedure is started by adding 1  mL of MnSO 4 followed by 1  mL alkali-iodide-azide by using a pipette holding just above the sample surfaces. All the samples are thoroughly mixed after closing {{the lid of the}} bottles, and the precipitates are allowed to settle half the bottle volume. H 2 SO 4 is then added to each of the samples <b>and</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>until</b> proper dissolution. After this, 200  mL sample of the original samples is titrated in a conical flask using a burette of least count of ±[*] 0.1  mL containing sodium thiosulfate solution (Na 2 S 2 O 3) after adding few drops of starch indicator to the testing samples. The volume of the Na 2 S 2 O 3 solution utilized in titration is noted {{in order to determine the}} initial and final DO of the representative samples.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Boron carbide powder was {{synthesized}} by sol-gel polycondensation of {{boric acid}} with citric acid. The starting materials of Serbian origin were dissolved in water <b>and</b> <b>mixed</b> homogeneously <b>until</b> a precomposite gel was formed, which was converted into cryogels after freeze-drying. Pyrolysing and subsequent heat treatment of these cryogels resulted in boron carbide materials. Characterization by nitrogen adsorption {{showed that the}} precomposite cryogels and the composite powders were micro and mesoporous materials with large surface areas. Materials have been analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The Rietveld refinement was employed to get the structural information of the synthesized powder. The {{results show that the}} obtained carbide powder is composed of nearly equiaxed particles of narrow size distribution...|$|R
5000|$|Studio B was {{the primary}} {{recording}} <b>and</b> <b>mixing</b> space <b>until</b> 1981. It was originally designed by John Storyk. There were originally quad Westlake/601-style monitors oriented such that each looked like the iconic Bearsville Bear logo; the LF drivers as [...] "eyes", their ports as [...] "ears", the HF driver as a [...] "nose", and the horn as a [...] "mouth". In 1982, studio B underwent a major renovation. The acoustic concept was designed by George Augspurger. The Quad-Eight was removed and a Neve 8058 console took its place, along with many upgrades to equipment and facility. In 1985, Bob Clearmountain chose Bearsville Studios as his primary east coast recording facility. In response to Clearmountain's involvement, an SSL 4000E console was installed.|$|R
25|$|For {{large-scale}} {{preparation of}} mayonnaise where mixing equipment is being employed, the process typically {{begins with the}} dispersal of eggs, either powdered or liquid, into water. Once emulsified, the remaining ingredients are then added <b>and</b> vigorously <b>mixed</b> <b>until</b> completely hydrated <b>and</b> evenly dispersed. Oil is then added as rapidly {{as it can be}} absorbed. Though {{only a small part of}} the total, ingredients other than the oil are critical to proper formulation. These must be totally hydrated and dispersed within a small liquid volume, which can cause difficulties including emulsion breakdown during the oil-adding phase. Often, a long agitation process is required to achieve proper dispersal/emulsification, presenting one of the trickiest phases of the production process. Though, as technology in the food industry advances, processing has been shortened drastically, allowing roughly 1000 liters to be produced in 10 minutes.|$|R

25|$|Alternately {{attributed}} to the 16th and 17th centuries, Groote Wafelen from the Belgian Een Antwerps kookboek was published as the first recipe to use leavening (beer yeast): Take white flour, warm cream, fresh melted butter, yeast, <b>and</b> <b>mix</b> together <b>until</b> the flour is no longer visible. Then add ten or twelve egg yolks. Those {{who do not want}} them to be too expensive may also add the egg white and just milk. Put the resulting dough at the fireplace for four hours to let it rise better before baking it. Until this time, no recipes contained leavening and could therefore be easily cooked in the thin moule à oublies. Groote Wafelen, in its use of leavening, was the genesis of contemporary waffles and validates the use of deeper irons (wafelijzers) depicted in the Beuckelaer and Bruegel paintings of the time.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{montmorillonite}} (MMT) nanoclay reinforced {{epoxy resin}} {{was prepared to}} study the effect of nano filler on tensile and flexural properties of its nanocomposite. MMT was first sonicated for 2 hours with an acetone where the ratio was 50 mL acetone: 1 g clay. After being sonicated the clay was added to an epoxy resin matrix at 80 °C <b>and</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>until</b> the acetone was removed. Tensile and flexural tests were investigated to understand the effect of clay on the mechanical properties of MMT reinforced epoxy nanocomposite. In general, the mechanical properties of MMT/epoxy nanocomposites were slightly increased as the clay loading was increased up to 1 phr. However, {{for the amount of}} nanoclay more than 1 phr the result showed significantly decrease in mechanical properties. It was found that by adding the nanoclay up to 1 phr, the Young’s and flexural modulus increased around 6. 75 % and 6. 61 %, respectively. Since the nanoclay has higher elastic modulus as compared to epoxy resin, the addition of clay increased the modulus of its nanocomposites. On the other hand, at 2 phr of nanoclay the tensile strength, Young’s modulus, flexural strength and flexural modulus deceased around 44. 12 %, 17. 24 %, 17. 84 % and 10. 77 % respectively compared to pure epoxy. For more than 1 phr of filler the clay distributions might not be well dispersed and thus more agglomerations occurred in the composites. It can be concluded that, 1 phr of MMT filler was the optimum amount that can be reinforced with epoxy resin in term of tensile and flexural properties...|$|R
