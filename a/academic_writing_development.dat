40|$|LINK TO DIALOGUES: [URL] 29 June 2011, 280 delegates {{interested}} in the teaching, tutoring, research, administration and development of academic writing in higher education in Europe descended upon the University of Limerick to discuss {{the role of the}} student experience in shaping <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>development</b> in higher education. The EATAW 2011 conference invited all those {{interested in}} <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>development</b> in higher education to contribute to the discussion on enhancing the quality of the student experience through writing. Enhancing the student experience is central to the vision and mission of most higher education institutions in Europe and beyond. How students experience academic writing impacts upon their identities and on their participation in academic and disciplinary environments. Writing programmes and initiatives that actively engage students in the writing conventions and practices of their academic communities can enhance the quality of the student learning experience...|$|E

40|$|Supporting {{undergraduate}} students with their academic literacies {{has recently been}} a major focus in {{higher education in the}} UK. This paper explores the value of tutor mediation in the context of <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>development</b> among undergraduate business studies students in open and distance learning, following the dynamic assessment (DA) approach that has been developed within Vygotskian sociocultural theory of learning (Vygotsky, 1978). DA is an assessment approach that blends instruction and assessment. The data, which came from a pilot study of a larger research project, consisted of text-based interaction between a tutor–researcher and two business studies students across various drafts of two assignments in line with the DA approach. This interaction was mediated by computers mainly through emails. The analyses of such interaction suggest that DA can help to identify and respond to the areas that students need the most support in (in this study, managing information flow). Finally, we argue that a learning theory-driven approach such as DA can contribute to {{undergraduate students}}’ <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>development</b> by responding to their individual needs...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{shifts the}} {{traditional}} emphasis around <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> and <b>writing</b> <b>development</b> from students’ shortcomings as writers to {{an exploration of}} an under-researched aspect of the debate, namely lecturers’ perspectives of <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> (their own and students). It draws on a New Literacy Studies (NLS) approach that locates <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> and <b>writing</b> <b>development</b> in higher education, within a critical and situated theory of practice. The research is located within a postmodern, post-structural paradigm and involves a deliberate deconstruction of methodologies involved in traditional qualitative research (Stronach and MacLure, 1997). Foucault’s concept of ‘disciplinary power’, Lather’s suspicion of scientism (1986) {{and the work of}} feminist theorists like Pillow (2000), and Richardson (1997) are used to challenge traditional notions around qualitative research. Post-qualitative research methods and ideas (St. Pierre, 2011) are used to deterritorialise and reterritorialise traditional qualitative methodologies, with forms and ideas that speak in new ways about qualitative research practices and how researchers might handle qualitative data differently. Lecturers’ statements in the research setting are used to explore dominant epistemes and discourses circulating around <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> practices. The thesis proposes that lecturers and students are engaged in an inherently tense and problematic relationship around <b>academic</b> <b>writing,</b> described by Baynham and Prinsloo (2008) as a process of constant ‘recontextualisation’. Alongside the statements from research participants, autoethnography passages appear throughout the thesis (Ellis and Bochner, 2000). These passages reflect the multiplicity of relational and dynamic discourses that inform <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> practices in higher education. The assemblages and imaginaries offered in the final chapter are exercises in educational philosophy and reflection. They represent an attempt to write out/up/through my own subjectivity and respond to the statements made by the research participants which reflected how they lived, thought and worked with <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> practices in higher education...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} delivery of support for <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> skills <b>development.</b> The paper also presents {{a case study of}} such support on an undergraduate, part-time degree programme at University College Dublin (UCD). Elton (2010) suggests that the approach to <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> is discipline dependent and that neither specialists in <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> nor practising <b>academics</b> in a discipline can separately provide students with the necessary support to develop the ability to write. Three models of academic skills support are provided in the literature; bolt-on, build-on and build-up. These models provide a useful framework for conceptualizing the different approaches to skills <b>development</b> (<b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> in this case). The 2 ̆ 7 bolt on 2 ̆ 7 approach describes institutions that provide additional sessions to address <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> (Wingate, 2006). The 2 ̆ 7 build-in 2 ̆ 7 approach is where the provision of such support is embedded into the curriculum and usually occurs early in a student’s studies. Finally, the ‘build-up’ approach, first suggested by Dowling and Ryan (2007), is explored. In this approach, institutions provide supports embedded in the delivery of the curriculum and allow students to 2 ̆ 7 build-up 2 ̆ 7 their <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> skills, not only upon programme commencement, but throughout the duration of their studies. The paper asserts a greater likelihood of success in developing <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> skills where interventions are embedded within a broader framework of student support.

40|$|For {{students}} new {{to higher}} education the task of developing their <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> skills, and particularly the principles and practices of source-referencing, can be daunting. Although institutions and teachers can and do provide positive guidance on this score, all too often students veer into inadvertent plagiarism through lack of confidence and confusion. This case-study identifies opportunities through collaborative work to help students approach referencing with greater clarity and confidence. A project with first-year Arts students engaged in collaborative writing encouraged them to attend to their recording and writing-up of source references by using individual ‘reading and referencing’ logs and then passing on completed references to their group’s designated bibliographer. Checks on later, solo, assignments by these students {{indicated that they were}} less likely to stray into inadvertent plagiarism, whilst feedback from the students themselves pointed towards improved confidence in their <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> skills and <b>development</b> of study habits conducive to effective self-monitorin...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{assessment}} and feedback in Higher Education (HE) indicates there is lower student satisfaction regarding {{assessment and}} feedback than for {{other aspects of}} HE academic support (HEFCE, 2010). It is argued that assessment and feedback is conservative and monologic in HE (Nicol, 2010). Therefore, {{there is a need}} for further investigation of how assessment could be made more responsive to students’ needs and their learning. This study explored the nature of formative feedback provided in an open and distance learning undergraduate module that focused on academic literacy skills for business studies. Particularly, this study examined the relationship between the formative feedback provided by tutors and the extent to which students’ <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>development</b> did/did not improve over two assignments. The study followed a mixed methods approach in which the data were collected through a survey (n = 22), and student (n = 8) and tutor (n = 6) interviews. Additionally, student assignments (n= 16) and associated tutor feedback (n= 16) were collected from those students who were interviewed. While the survey data were statistically analysed, the interview data were thematically examined. The student assignments and the associated tutor feedback were analysed to explore any evidence of student learning (i. e., <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>development)</b> which may have been as a result of the tutor feedback. The findings suggest that there is some evidence of positive impacts of assessment materials and tutor feedback on student learning.

40|$|One of {{the aims}} of using Turnitin as a {{formative}} assessment tool centres on trying to shift habits of practice in respect of developing <b>academic</b> <b>writing.</b> The use of Turnitin is promoted {{as a means of}} shifting practice, for students and tutors, by challenging existing habits in respect of <b>academic</b> <b>writing.</b> Therefore we have investigated Turnitin as a support for the development of new approaches to engaging students with their writing. A significant aspect that emerged in our research was use of the software to promote its developmental advantages, and to shift student perceptions away from plagiarism detection toward supporting and developing their <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> skills. Also we found that the lack of understanding about the implications of originality and similarity reports has meant a need to engage in more discussion around student <b>writing</b> <b>development,</b> their responsibility for that writing and how the tool enables opportunities for formative feedback. In these respects it is useful to consider the use of Turnitin as a means to question particular habits of practice and develop a more student-focused tool to support and enhance <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> skills.

40|$|E-learning {{approaches}} {{employed in}} a variety of contexts, from instructional to collaborative and contested, currently support <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>development</b> (e. g. Goodfellow, 2005; Peretz, 2005; Brown et al., 2008). This paper is an early report on progress in developing a suite of six instructional e-learning modules on aspects of critical reading and writing at a research-intensive, science- and engineering-strong university. At this university, non-remedial <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>development</b> is supported by subject teaching staff, Royal Literary Fund Fellows, the English Language Centre and through information skills courses run by the Library. The current project seeks to complement the existing provision by providing undergraduates with guidance through e-learning modules that engage the students in learning tasks that can be completed independently or under the guidance of teaching staff in subject disciplines (shifting between more instructional to more cognitive-constructivist and social-constructivist approaches; Mayes and de Freitas, 2004). Strengths of the e-learning project include collaboration between staff from widely different backgrounds, including a professional writer and academic writing facilitator, a faculty librarian, and a teaching fellow. In addition, detailed feedback on each module’s learning efficacy and ease-of-use is being gathered systematically from students both during the module’s development and after its launch. In designing the e-modules, the researchers and developers have been driven by pedagogical imperatives (Mayes and de Freitas, 2004; Beetham and Sharpe, 2007; Biggs and Tang, 2007; Race, 2007) rather than wishing to be led or overly constrained by perceived limitations of online technologies. Among the challenges have been how to design online activities that facilitate deep learning (Marton and Säljö, 1976; Biggs, 1987) and how to create experiences that are relevant to students from a variety of disciplines. The paper will consider the extent to which such aspirations have been met...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{application}} of a formative assessment approach known as Dynamic Assessment (DA), as developed within the Vygotskian sociocultural theory of learning. DA blends instruction with assessment by targeting and further developing students' Zone of Proximal Development (ZPO). The study investigates whether, and if so. how DA enhances students' academic writing and conceptual development in business studies over time. DA and Hallidayan Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) informed the methodological design of this study. which employed a mixed methods approach in order to track learners' ZPDs regarding <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>development.</b> The use of SFL to provide linguistic evidence for student writing development (ZPD) is new in DA and thus an innovative feature of this study. The data consists of six undergraduate business studies students' three to four drafts of three assessments, which were analysed for textual and ideational meanings, as well as associated text-based interaction (mediation), complemented by student interviews and subject tutors' written comments. Whilst the mediation was analysed using categories derived from Poehner (2005). thematic analysis was used to examine the interviews and tutor comments. The findings suggest that DA, combined with SFL. provides insights into the learners' maturing writing abilities. which the tutor can nurture further to help the learners internalise them. This study also shows that DA students made more gains than their non-DA counterparts regarding their ability to write a case study analysis genre over time. Additionally, the findings suggest that students can transfer their academic writing and conceptual knowledge from one assessment task to another, albeit at a varying level. The study, though small in scale, thus, supports the view that targeted tutor support potentially enhances students' <b>academic</b> <b>writing</b> <b>development.</b> Implications arc drawn concerning formative writing assessment research and practice in higher education.

The weakness of the widely-used group-based institutional status approach is demonstrated with two distinct student-centered approaches, self-assessment and test scores, both of which highlight the within-groups variation that is hidden in group-based approaches. Between-texts variation is further explored through the comparison of self-assessment and text-centered approaches to classification such as test item (response) scores, and widely used measures of lexical variation and syntactic complexity.

40|$|Fail Better’ is an {{approach}} which supports first year students’ successful transition {{to higher education}} academic writing practices. ‘Fail Better’ uses a broadly academic literacies model of development to address students’ failure and struggle with writing. Rather than blaming students for ‘poor writing’, ‘Fail Better’ maintains that experiences of struggle and failure with academic writing {{are part of an}} inevitable and necessary process as students ‘write themselves’ into new disciplinary-based academic writing communities. The final part of the paper explores how subject lecturers, who are often not confident or willing writing developers, can, through the application of “Fail Better’ principles, offer their students a time-efficient, proactive and supportive model of writing development.
