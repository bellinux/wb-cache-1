40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} implementation of <b>a</b> solar-powered <b>hot</b> <b>tub.</b> The concept of this project was to design <b>an</b> independently-operated <b>hot</b> <b>tub</b> powered by <b>a</b> 12 V rechargeable battery, charged during the day by a single 400 W solar panel. For this purpose, <b>a</b> twenty-year-old name-brand <b>hot</b> <b>tub</b> was purchased, in used condition. The plumbing, AC electrical wiring, and mechanical pumps were all removed and replaced with new components to meet our design specifications. Additionally, a solar water-heater was designed and integrated into the system to directly apply the sun’s heat to water pumped {{in and out of}} the tub, which significantly reduced the power budget for the system. Furthermore, the tub structure was fitted with energy efficient LED lighting for night-time use. Lastly, a user-friendly control and display unit was designed and embedded into the tub’s mechanical structure to allow owners to adjust and set modes of operation, jet and heat cycle times, and lighting options. Our design allows an owner to continually power their <b>hot</b> <b>tub</b> at no additional cost every month. This project served as a channel through which much of our studies in microelectronic, embedded system, and power system design got put into practice...|$|R
