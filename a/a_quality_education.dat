5|$|Blackwell and {{her parents}} lived in Lula, until 1936 when she was three years old; Blackwell's father left the {{plantation}} on which he worked, and fled to Memphis, Tennessee, fearing for his life after he confronted his boss about speaking to his wife. Soon afterwards, Blackwell and her mother left the plantation to live with him. Blackwell's family traveled frequently in search of work. On June 20, 1938, Blackwell's parents separated due to religious differences. Blackwell and her mother went to West Helena, Arkansas, to live with Blackwell's great aunt so {{that she had the}} opportunity to receive an education. <b>A</b> <b>quality</b> <b>education</b> in Mississippi was not an option for Blackwell because the schools there were centered on the cultivation of crops and the plantation system. While living in West Helena, Blackwell often visited her father in Memphis. During the summer months she would leave West Helena and live with her grandfather and grandmother in Lula, where she helped plant and harvest cotton. Blackwell spent a majority of her early years chopping cotton in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee and peeling tomatoes in Florida. She was 14 when she finished the eighth grade, the final year of school at Westside, a school in West Helena for black children. Blackwell had to quit school to earn for her family.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, as {{a result}} of the efforts of Meister, the faculty, and the Parents Association, the school became co-ed, giving girls of New York equal {{opportunity}} to pursue <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>education</b> in a specialized high school, previously denied to them. This expansion to co-education preceded its rivals Stuyvesant (1969) and Brooklyn Tech (1970) by more than two decades.|$|E

500|$|Despite Glinka's {{international}} attention, {{which included}} the admiration of Liszt and Berlioz for his music and his heralding by the latter as [...] "among the outstanding composers of his time", Russian aristocrats remained focused exclusively on foreign music. Music itself was bound by class structure, and except for a modest role in public life was still considered a privilege of the aristocracy. Nobles spent enormous sums on musical performances for their exclusive enjoyment and hosted visiting artists such as Clara Schumann and Franz Liszt {{but there were no}} ongoing concert societies, no critical press and no public eagerly anticipating new works. No competent level of music education existed. Private tutors were available in some cities but tended to be badly trained. Anyone desiring <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>education</b> had to travel abroad. Composer and pianist Anton Rubinstein's founding of the Russian Musical Society in 1859 and the Saint Petersburg Conservatory three years later were giant steps toward remedying this situation but also proved highly controversial ones. Among this group was a young legal clerk named Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.|$|E
500|$|Having {{moved back}} to Adelaide, Gillard was {{appointed}} an honorary Visiting Professor of Politics at the University of Adelaide in 2013. In October of that year, she joined the Brookings Institution's Center for Universal Education as a nonresident senior fellow. In February 2014, Gillard was appointed chairwoman of the Global Partnership for Education, an international organisation focused on getting all children into school for <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>education</b> in the world's poorest countries. Later that year, in December, Gillard joined {{the board of the}} mental health organisation beyondblue, chaired by former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett. Kennett announced on 21 March 2017 that he would be stepping down from the position during the second–half of the year, almost 17 years after founding the organisation; Gillard succeeded him as chair of beyondblue on 1 July 2017, becoming the first former Prime Minister since Malcolm Fraser to head a mental-health organisation. Since February 2015 she has been the patron of the John Curtin Prime Ministerial Library at Curtin University in Perth. On 30 June 2015, she was conferred with a fellowship from Aberystwyth University in recognition of her [...] "significant contribution to political life". In September 2016 Gillard was appointed a visiting professor at King's College London, joining the King's Policy Institute and the Menzies Centre for Australian Studies.|$|E

2500|$|Aside from students, {{teachers}} and school staff also face their own obstacles in working with refugee students. They have concerns {{about their ability to}} meet the mental, physical, emotional, and educational needs of students. One study of newly arrived Bantu students from Somalia in a Chicago school questioned whether schools were equipped to provide them with <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>education</b> that met the needs of the pupils. The students were not aware of how to use pencils, which caused them to break the tips requiring frequent sharpening. Teachers may even see refugee students as different from other immigrant groups, {{as was the case with}} the Bantu pupils. Teachers may sometimes feel that their work is made harder because of the pressures to meet [...] state requirements for testing. With refugee children falling behind or struggling to catch up, it can overwhelm {{teachers and}} administrators.|$|E
2500|$|Native Hawaiians are {{eligible}} for an education from the Kamehameha Schools, established through the {{last will and testament}} of Bernice Pauahi Bishop of the Kamehameha Dynasty. The largest and wealthiest private school in the United States, Kamehameha Schools was intended to benefit indigents and orphans, with preference given to native Hawaiians. The Kamehameha Schools provides <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>education</b> to thousands of children of whole and part native Hawaiian ancestry at its campuses during the regular school year, and also has quality summer and off-campus programs that are not restricted by ancestry. Kamehameha Schools' practice of accepting primarily gifted students, in lieu of intellectually challenged children, has been a controversial topic amongst the native Hawaiian community. Many 'rejected' families feel that the gifted students could excel at any learning institution, public or private. Thus, the Hawaiian community may be better served by educating children from high-risk, high-crime districts so that a greater proportion of disadvantaged youths may grow up to be responsible community contributors.|$|E
2500|$|A week later, on February 23, the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee {{convened a}} meeting to invite Fluke to speak. Fluke offered {{testimony}} in support of President Obama's ruling that religiously affiliated institutions such as universities and hospitals should provide insurance plans that cover all costs for medicinal contraceptives. During her testimony, Fluke stated, [...] "We did not expect that women would be told in the national media {{that we should have}} gone to school elsewhere" [...] to receive contraception coverage. [...] "We refuse to pick between <b>a</b> <b>quality</b> <b>education</b> and our health," [...] she said. Fluke further stated that 40% of Georgetown Law School's female population suffered financial hardship as a result of birth control not being covered by the student health insurance plan, and that the lack of contraception coverage in the university insurance plans would induce many low-income students to go without contraceptives. She said that the women of Georgetown, other religious schools, and employees of religious institutions such as hospitals have endured [...] "financial, emotional and medical burdens because of this lack of contraceptive coverage". She mentioned friends affected by such policies, citing a friend with polycystic ovary syndrome. Fluke stated this friend needed contraceptive hormones costing over $100 per month to treat the disease, and that while PcOS was [...] "covered by Georgetown insurance", the insurance company repeatedly denied contraceptives because they suspected the purpose of the medication was for contraceptive uses.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide some insights for developing <b>a</b> high <b>quality</b> university through democratizing the contemporary university management practices. The high quality university has often the quality academic programs, quality teaching faculty members, and quality students for establishing high educational standards. The faculty of high quality universities engages in high quality research and produce high quality and quantity of new knowledge and publications. The graduates of high quality universities usually obtain high quality professional positions. They also generate the necessary physical and financial resources and endowments for supporting themselves. Those universities that develop these <b>quality</b> characteristics offer <b>a</b> high <b>quality</b> <b>education.</b> Democratization of the university management practices plays a key role for a university to develop <b>a</b> high <b>quality</b> <b>education</b> and become <b>a</b> high <b>quality</b> university. In this study, democratization process includes the ownership, the practice of sharing the authority and responsibility, group decision-making, horizontal network organizational structure and long term employment practices of university management. Those universities utilizing these practices together and acting collectively as a team are able to achieve <b>a</b> high <b>quality</b> <b>education</b> and become <b>a</b> high <b>quality</b> university. Democratization process will also help stakeholders of the university to establish close cooperation and relations with public and private institutions for financing the university...|$|R
