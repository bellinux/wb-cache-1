40|$|Ferroic {{transition}} metal oxides, which exhibit spontaneous elastic, electrical, magnetic or toroidal order, exhibit functional properties that find use in ultrastable solid-state memories to sensors and medical imaging technologies. To realize multifunctional behavior, where one order parameter can be coupled to the conjugate field of another order parameter, however, requires a common microscopic origin for the long-range order. Here, we formulate a complete theory for a novel form of ferroelectricity, whereby a spontaneous and switchable polarization {{emerges from the}} destruction of an antiferroelectric state due to octahedral rotations and ordered cation sublattices. We then construct a materials design framework based on crystal-chemistry descriptors rooted in group theory, which enables the facile design of <b>artificial</b> <b>oxides</b> with large electric polarizations, P, simultaneous with small energetic switching barriers between +P and -P. We validate the theory with first principles density functional calculations on more than 16 perovskite-structured oxides, illustrating it could be operative in any materials classes exhibiting two- or three-dimensional corner-connected octahedral frameworks. We show the principles governing materials selection of the "layered" systems originate in the lattice dynamics of the A cation displacements stabilized by the pervasive BO$_ 6 $ rotations of single phase ABO$_ 3 $ materials, whereby the latter distortions govern the optical band gaps, magnetic order and critical transition temperatures. Our approach provides the elusive route to the ultimate multifunctionality property control by an external electric field. Comment: 13 pages, 11 figure...|$|E

In this technique, one ion beam sputters Nb from a target, while the second ion beam directly bombards the growing film. The T c of these NbN films is typically 11 - 12 K when deposited on near-room temperature substrates. Preliminary results on tunneling through a native oxide barrier yield a superconducting energy gap for NbN of 1. 9 meV, for which 2 A/kT c = 3. 9. We have also studied oxidized overlayers of AI and Ta to produce an <b>artificial</b> <b>oxide</b> tunneling barrier.

Careful measurements of local current-voltage characteristics of the system Ni-Nb / NiNb oxide/Pt, were carried out in contact mode of an atomic force microscope. Native oxide showed n-type conductivity, while in the artificial one exhibited p-type one. The shape of current-voltage characteristic curves is unique in both cases and no analogical behavior is found in the literature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were used to detect chemical composition of the oxide films and the oxidation state of the alloy components. Detailed analysis of the XPS data revealed that the structure of natural Ni-Nb oxide film consists of Ni-NbOx top layer and nickel enriched bottom layer which provides n-type conductivity.

Based on a systematic first-principles density functional theory study of the magnetic and electronic properties of the (111) superlattices (ABO 3) 2 /(AB'O 3) 10 of 4 d and 5 d transition metal perovskite (B = Ru, Rh, Ag, Re, Os, Ir, Au; AB'O 3 = LaAlO 3, SrTiO 3), we demonstrate that due to quantum confinement, bilayers (LaBO 3) 2 (B = Ru, Re, Os) and (SrBO 3) 2 (B = Rh, Os, Ir) are ferromagnetic with ordering temperatures up to room temperature. In particular, bilayer (LaOsO 3) 2 is an exotic spin-polarized quantum anomalous Hall insulator, while the other ferromagnetic bilayers are metallic with large Hall conductances comparable to the conductance quantum. Furthermore, bilayers (LaRuO 3) 2 and (SrRhO 3) 2 are half-metallic, while bilayer (SrIrO 3) 2 exhibits peculiar colossal magnetic anisotropy. Our findings thus show that 4 d and 5 d metal perovskite (111) bilayers are a class of quasi-two-dimensional materials for exploring exotic quantum phases and also for advanced applications such as low-power nanoelectronics and oxide spintronics.

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of controlling the}} interfacial properties of <b>artificial</b> <b>oxide</b> heterostructures is still attracting researchers {{in the field of}} materials engineering. Here, we used surface sensitive techniques and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy to investigate the evolution of the surface spin-polarization and lattice strains across the interfaces between La 0. 66 Sr 0. 33 MnO 3 thin films and low-doped manganites as capping layers. We have been able to finely tune the interfacial spin-polarization by changing the capping layer thickness and composition. The spin-polarization was found to be highest at a critical capping thickness that depends on the Sr doping. We explain the non-trivial magnetic profile by the combined effect of two mechanisms. On one hand, the extra carriers supplied by the low-doped manganites that tend to compensate the overdoped interface, favouring locally a ferromagnetic double-exchange coupling. On the other hand, the evolution from a tensile-strained structure of the inner layers to a compressed structure at the surface that changes gradually the orbital occupation and hybridization of the 3 d-Mn orbitals, being detrimental for the spin polarization. The finding of an intrinsic spin-polarization at the A-site cation observed in XMCD measurements reveals also the existence of a complex magnetic configuration at the interface, different from the magnetic phases observed at the inner layers.

40|$|A review. In recent years, {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made in the computational design of functional artificial enzymes. When combined with directed evolution protocols, their efficiencies are comparable to those obtained with catalytic antibodies. In comparison, the in silico creation of artificial metalloenzymes remains challenging. This could be due to the difficulty in computing both the transition states for metal-catalyzed reactions and the corresponding entatic state for a metalloenzyme. In a recent study, structurally characterized a functional bacterial nitric oxide reductase within a myoglobin scaffold has been rationally designed. This ground-breaking study by Lu and coworkers has opened the way towards the rational design of artificial metalloenzymes for more challenging reactions. For the <b>artificial</b> nitric <b>oxide</b> reductase, several issues deserve further scrutiny: catalytic efficiency as well as detailed reaction mechanism. In a broader perspective, the use of more elaborate computational algorithms, combined with efficient directed-evolution protocols should enable the creation and optimization of highly versatile artificial metalloenzymes in a variety of protein folds.

The oxide barrier was either natural or <b>artificial</b> (aluminium <b>oxide).</b> The high junction quality allowed precise {{measurements of the}} differential conduction up to high bias-voltages of 120 mV.

40|$|The {{tremendous}} {{progress in}} thin-film processing {{has opened up}} an exciting new field of applications for ferroelectric materials in information and semiconductor technology today. Exemplarily, {{the development of the}} Ferroelectric Random Access Memory (FeRAM) was enabled, which uses the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric thin-films to store digital information non-volatile. Beyond, ferroelectric films are likewise employed due to their outstanding dielectric, piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties. The prospective success of any of these technologies will first and foremost depend on their potential to fulfill the markets requirement for ever growing integration densities. The scalability of ferroelectric materials however is still under discussion and therefore subject to various research projects. Size-effects in real systems are expected to be often rather extrinsically determined by technological issues like processing induced damage and boundary conditions than intrinsically. The general question arises, how ferroelectric nanostructures can be processed with Gbit integration densities for future devices without deteriorating their physical properties. In addition, electrical characterization of these structures is hampered as the electric charge to detect scales with lateral cell dimension. A surface charge of a 100 nm 2 capacitor that features a 30 µC/cm 2 polarization is compensated by merely 180 electrons for example. Hence, ferroelectricity of capacitors below 200 x 200 nm 2 in lateral dimensions was so far only shown qualitatively and indirectly via their piezoelectric properties. In the framework of this thesis, bottom-up grown ferroelectric lead titanate (PTO) nanoislands are studied in terms of their potential for integration and electrical characterization. The production method applied is based on Chemical Solution Deposition (CSD) which is especially suited as it features a non-destructive, parallel processing of smallest ferroelectric nanostructures. A new method, based on pre-defined <b>artificial</b> titanium <b>oxide</b> nucleation sites, is introduced to enable growth of the ferroelectric crystals with a precise arrangement and a uniform size distribution. Using this technique, the ferroelectric nanostructure arrays achieve integration densities up to 6. 4 ~Gbit/cm 2 – for the first time obtained in the field of well-ordered functional ferroelectric nanostructures. Regarding electrical characterization of the nanoislands, an integration method based on flowable oxide layers and Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) is presented. It is shown, that using the polishing step electrical contact can be provided to completely insulated, ferroelectric nanoislands of lowest heights (< 20 nm). A significant deterioration of the ferroelectric properties due to this processing method is not detected which is supported by direct electrical characterization of the embedded nanoislands. Electrical hysteresis measurements are facilitated by connecting the islands in parallel.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is a {{mediator}} of vascular smooth muscle tension that metabolises rapidly in blood. NO {{delivered by inhalation}} can therefore {{be used as a}} selective pulmonary vasodilator to relieve pulmonary hypertension or to improve oxygenation with no systemic effects. In <b>artificial</b> ventilation nitric <b>oxide</b> has been administered in inspiration gas as a continuous gas flow or to form constant inspired concentration. Homogeneous inspired gas mixture has been regarded essential for successful therapy and the therapy has been characterized by the mixture NO concentration. The response in oxygenation on NO therapy has, however, been variable. Administration of NO as a short pulse synchronously with inspiration has been suggested to improve the response. In this study the NO administration was examined theoretically and experimentally with the aim to relieve pulmonary hypertension and improve oxygenation during artificial ventilation. For the experimental study a system for the synchronized administration was developed. The effect on oxygenation was studied during equine anaesthesia where hypoxemia develops regularly secondary to left-to-right shunt caused by atelectasis. By administering the NO as a short pulse in early inspiration to well ventilated lung areas the oxygenation could be effectively improved. Delayed administration to low ventilated lung areas was found possible for a negative contribution on oxygenation, which reduces the improvement gained in the well-ventilated lung areas. When NO is delivered into the whole inspiration, the net effect on oxygenation is the sum of these negative and positive contributions, whereas with pulsed delivery to the early inspiration the negative contribution can be avoided. This finding may be the main explanation for the varying response in oxygenation detected in patients as a response to NO inhalation. When the NO therapy aimed for the relief of induced pulmonary hypertension in pigs, no difference was observed between NO delivery as a short pulse or given to the whole inspiration. Maximum vasodilatation was observed with 105 nmol/min delivery rate. A larger delivery rate only contributed to an abrupt increase in pulmonary pressure at cessation of the delivery. The NO uptake from alveoli to tissue depends on the alveolar NO partial pressure. In a simulation this partial pressure was shown to be independent of the administration mode. Also the relationship between the NO uptake and delivery setting was not explicit. With pulsed delivery, expired NO can be reduced which was confirmed by the experimental results. This is important when the NO therapy is given in rebreathing circuit...|$|R
