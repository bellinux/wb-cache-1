5|$|Eddy Raja {{is an old}} rival of Nathan Drake. Voiced by James Sie, he is a {{longtime}} rival of Drake {{and the leader of}} a group of pirates. Raja first met Drake before the events of Uncharted: Eye of Indra, where they worked together on a job. Drake double-crossed him, however, and Eddy continues to hold <b>a</b> <b>grudge.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, was {{of royal}} blood, he was {{commonly}} {{viewed as a}} criminal, prone to violence and stupidity. A proven enemy of the Nevilles, Exeter bore <b>a</b> <b>grudge</b> particularly against Warwick for displacing him from his hereditary role of Lord High Admiral in 1457. Nonetheless, when Warwick joined the Lancastrians, Exeter obeyed Margaret and served under the Earl during the invasion of England. Although he supported the Lancastrian cause, Exeter had family ties to the House of York; he was husband to Anne of York, Edward's sister.|$|E
5|$|It {{has never}} been fully {{explained}} what motivated the attack: the gunmen {{claimed to have been}} acting on their own initiative, and despite abundant conspiracy theories, no convincing evidence surfaced to suggest that any political leader or party was behind the attack. Nevertheless, the killings left a leadership void in the political establishment. Conspiracy theories immediately flourished that the gunmen had been acting on orders to sabotage a Karabakh peace deal, but a decade on, the available evidence still pointed to the leading gunman being a loner with <b>a</b> <b>grudge</b> against the Armenian political elite.|$|E

5|$|Keynes's {{economic}} thinking only {{began to}} achieve close to universal acceptance {{in the last}} few years of his life. On a personal level, Keynes's charm was such that he was generally well received wherever he went – even those who found themselves on the wrong side of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore <b>a</b> <b>grudge.</b> Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.|$|E
5|$|Knox played club {{water polo}} for the Queensland Breakers in the Australian National Water Polo League. She {{was with the}} team in 2007, 2008 and 2009. The annual match between the KFC Breakers and the Barracudas is {{considered}} by The Courier-Mail as <b>a</b> <b>grudge</b> match. She participated in the 2008 game with her team. In 2010, they played in the finals tournament, and she {{was named to the}} league finals' All Star team. , she plays for the Victorian Tigers in the same league.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{loosely based}} on {{professional}} wrestling games, but more closely resembles a beat-'em up. The game can be played in two modes: a tournament style single-player game or <b>a</b> <b>grudge</b> match where two players can interact. The matches take place in ten different detailed 3D locations from Springfield, such as the Simpsons' house, the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, the Kwik-E-Mart, and Moe's Tavern. Letters float around in the wrestling ring, and if a wrestler collects enough of them, they can taunt and temporarily become invincible. A round ends when one wrestler pins their opponent for a three count. Two rounds are needed to win a match.|$|E
50|$|Tess Brock and Culum Struan fell in {{love and}} married. The couple {{condemned}} their fathers' hatred. Tyler Brock disowned his little Tess, <b>a</b> <b>grudging</b> act that has terrible consequences.|$|R

25|$|The active {{principles}} {{on which}} the Highland and Island Emigration Society was founded, and which it consistently espoused, were a mixture of liberal political economy, ill-disguised racism and <b>a</b> <b>grudging</b> form of charity.|$|R
5|$|The general's objectivity, however, {{has often}} been questioned. Vlahogiannis, in his preface to the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his lack of objectivity and impartiality. While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds <b>a</b> <b>grudge</b> against people he had come into conflict with. He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis, while staying silent about the more questionable deeds of people he had a favourable opinion of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not stem from selfishness, but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Al Khawalid {{dates to the}} 1920s, when the Khalids opposed the British-led {{administrative}} reforms and launched a military crackdown on the Shia who supported the reforms. The perpetrators were later put before a court that sentenced them to exile. They gradually returned to Bahrain, where they were kept outside government despite developing personal relations with those in power. They regained some influence since the late 1960s, but remained outside the inner decision-making circle. During this period, {{senior members of the}} Khalids were critical of the ruling family, opposed political reforms and held <b>a</b> <b>grudge</b> against the British.|$|E
5|$|To {{accomplish}} this goal, Harle helps Lynx manipulate the Acacia Dragoons, the powerful militia governing {{the islands of}} El Nido. As the Dragoons maintain order, they contend with Fargo, a former Dragoon turned pirate captain who holds <b>a</b> <b>grudge</b> against their leader, General Viper. Though tussling with Serge initially, the Acacia Dragoons—whose ranks include the fierce warriors Karsh, Zoah, Marcy, and Glenn—later assist him when the militaristic nation of Porre invades the archipelago. The invasion brings Norris and Grobyc to the islands, a heartful commander of an elite force and a prototype cyborg soldier, respectively, as they too seek the Frozen Flame.|$|E
50|$|He {{comes to}} have <b>a</b> <b>grudging</b> respect for Amanda Waller and her tough ways. Afterwards, the United States {{government}} asks Major Victory {{to maintain his}} post with the Squad and report on Waller's activities.|$|R

5|$|Alderson's {{situation}} worsened at the Battle of Festubert in May 1915, {{when the}} Canadian Division {{failed to make}} any headway and suffered nearly 2,500 casualties. Another operation a month later, the Second Battle of Givenchy, cost 366 casualties for no appreciable gain. Again, Alderson was not solely at fault in these actions and he remained popular with British Army Headquarters, Prime Minister Borden and with his men, resulting in promotion to command the entire Canadian Expeditionary Force when a second Division arrived late in 1915. Despite this popularity, Sam Hughes continued to hold <b>a</b> <b>grudge</b> against Alderson and opposed him in political circles, taking offense at Alderson's refusal to accept promotions made by Hughes or Carson of untried Canadian officers and instead promoting veteran British officers in their place. The main area of argument {{between the two men}} however was again over the Ross rifle.|$|E
5|$|An {{earthquake}} and subsequent volcanic eruption separates Orion {{from his parents}} and siblings. Joe locates Orion and manages to rescue him, disappearing himself in the process, while Ōu soldier Sasuke gets separated from Rigel and others. With the Ōu Mountains in complete disarray, new threats arrive to exploit its weaknesses. Three sons of the Irish Wolfhound Kamakiri, a platoon leader for Hōgen, wish to avenge their father's death. Kurohabaki Masamune, {{the leader of the}} Kurohabaki Clan of ninja dogs, aims to take over Ōu and strengthen his army. He is the adoptive son of the former Kurohabaki leader, Terumune, and was previously denied leadership of the clan, despite his striving for approval. Instead, Terumune decided that his blood-related son Yamabiko, born after Masamune's arrival, would become leader. Thereafter, Masamune banished Terumune and took control of the clan. He holds <b>a</b> <b>grudge</b> against Yamabiko and plans to find and kill him. Meanwhile, members of the Kurohabaki clan roam Ōu, gathering recruits and killing those who resist.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time gay men were getting sick in the U.S., doctors in Paris, France, were {{receiving}} patients who were African or {{who had lived in}} Africa with the same symptoms as Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, Françoise Barre, Luc Montagnier, and doctor Willy Rozenbaum began taking biopsies of HIV-infected lymph nodes and discovered a new retrovirus. As a scientific necessity to compare it to the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute, where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of <b>a</b> <b>grudge</b> he had against the Pasteur Institute. Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year.|$|E

50|$|Gatewood is torn by <b>a</b> <b>grudging</b> {{respect for}} Geronimo and his people, and {{his duty to}} his country. Brigadier General George Crook (Gene Hackman), charged with {{overseeing}} the forced settlement of the Apaches on reservations has nothing but admiration for Geronimo.|$|R
50|$|Paula {{discovers that}} Nell's {{seemingly}} indecipherable language is English, based partly on her mother's aphasic speech after a stroke, and {{partly on the}} secret language she shared with her decades-deceased identical twin sister. Jerry and Paula begin <b>a</b> <b>grudging</b> friendship.|$|R
5|$|At Stockholm, Brundage {{finished}} {{sixth in}} the pentathlon and 16th in the decathlon. Far behind on points, after eight events {{he dropped out of}} the decathlon, which he always regretted. He later moved up one spot in the standings in each event when his fellow American, Jim Thorpe, who had won both events, was disqualified after it was shown that he had played baseball for money: this meant Thorpe was considered a professional, not an amateur as was required for Olympic participation. Throughout his tenure as president, Brundage refused to ask the IOC to restore Thorpe's medals despite advocacy by Thorpe supporters. The committee eventually did so in 1982, after the deaths of both men. Brundage's refusal led to charges that he held <b>a</b> <b>grudge</b> for being beaten in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Chapman and Vause get {{revenge on}} Doggett and trick her {{into believing that}} she has faith healing powers, {{eventually}} culminating in her {{being sent to the}} psychiatric ward. Although Chapman aids in Doggett's release from the psychiatric ward, Doggett still bears <b>a</b> <b>grudge</b> against her. Doggett's lawyer encourages her to evangelize to Chapman instead and this leads to Chapman 'converting' but then refusing to be baptized. Doggett sees this as disrespectful and expresses a wish to kill Chapman. The two have a confrontation {{at the end of the}} season's final episode. Doggett attacks Chapman with a shiv made from a wooden cross; Chapman throws Doggett to the ground and hits her repeatedly.|$|E
5|$|During {{a nature}} camp, Anju gets photographed in the {{bathroom}} by a hidden cell phone. The culprit, Varun (Roshan Basheer), {{is the son of}} police inspector general Geetha Prabhakar (Asha Sarath). Varun is accidentally killed by Rani and her daughter when he comes to blackmail them. They hide his body in a compost pit, which is witnessed by Anu. Rani tells Georgekutty about the incident and he devises a way to save his family from the law. He removes the broken cell phone and disposes of Varun's car, which is seen by Constable Sahadevan (Kalabhavan Shajon), who has <b>a</b> <b>grudge</b> against Georgekutty. Georgekutty takes them out on a trip to Thodupuzha to pray in a church, watch a movie and eat at a restaurant. Geetha, seeing that her son has gone missing, starts an investigation.|$|E
5000|$|Cotton had an {{antagonistic}} {{relationship with}} Peggy, whom he addressed as [...] "Hank's wife" [...] among other epithets. On rare occasions though, Cotton evinced <b>a</b> <b>grudging</b> respect for Peggy, as in [...] "To Spank With Love" [...] and [...] "Cotton's Plot." ...|$|R
60|$|To this {{suggestion}} the provost gave <b>a</b> <b>grudging</b> assent. The reward when the English spy was caught could be fought for later on. For the nonce he turned unceremoniously on his heel, and left Fleury cursing {{him for a}} meddlesome busybody.|$|R
50|$|Haber is a cultured German, {{who is the}} {{complete}} foil for Erskine's rough and ready character. They are also love rivals, and initially the bitterness is strong between the two.
