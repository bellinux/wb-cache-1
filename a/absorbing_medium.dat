25|$|Consider {{the case}} of using gold as the source (mp = 1063°C). In this technique, the current through the {{filament}} of the pyrometer is adjusted until the light intensity of the filament matches that of a black-body at the melting point of gold. This establishes the primary calibration temperature and can be {{expressed in terms of}} current through the pyrometer lamp. With the same current setting, the pyrometer is sighted on another black-body at a higher temperature. An <b>absorbing</b> <b>medium</b> of known transmission is inserted between the pyrometer and this black-body. The temperature of the black-body is then adjusted until a match exists between its intensity and that of the pyrometer filament. The true higher temperature of the black-body is then determined from Planck's Law. The <b>absorbing</b> <b>medium</b> is then removed and the current through the filament is adjusted to match the filament intensity to that of the black-body. This establishes a second calibration point for the pyrometer. This step is repeated to carry the calibration to higher temperatures. Now, temperatures and their corresponding pyrometer filament currents are known and a curve of temperature versus current can be drawn. This curve can then be extrapolated to very high temperatures.|$|E

Colour vision in New World primates {{relies on a}} single gene on the X-chromosome to produce pigments that <b>absorb</b> <b>medium</b> and long wavelength light, which contrasts with short wavelength light. As a result, males rely on a single medium/long pigment gene and are dichromatic, as are homozygous females. Heterozygous females may possess two alleles with different sensitivities within this range, and so can display trichromatic vision.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{rainwater}} and seawater on the permittivity of denim jean substrate {{and performance of}} an ultrawideband (UWB) eye-shaped textile antenna is investigated in this letter. For the simulated and measured reflection coefficients in dry condition, {{it was found that}} the antenna operates at 2. 4 – 10. 9 and 1. 6 – 12 GHz, respectively, with the simulated gain between 3. 2 and 5. 8 dBi from 2 to 12 GHz with efficiencies greater than 50 %. The antenna can operate at the entire range in dry conditions when 10 dB, but with limited performance under wet conditions. However, it cannot be used when immersed in rainwater and seawater. From the investigation, it can be shown that the permittivities of denim jean substrate under wet and immersed conditions are proportional to the permittivities of the <b>absorbed</b> <b>medium</b> (rainwater or seawater) at 2 – 12 GHz...|$|R
40|$|Application of {{activated}} zeolite (ZAA) as {{molecular sieve}} to separate compounds of coal tar from vaccum fractional distillation, have been done. The size of zeolite was 10 - 20 mesh {{and used as}} solid phase in column chromatography with length of 30 cm. The first step of the research was coal pyrolisis and the product (tar) was distillated by fractional column and vaccum system at reduced pressure 44 cmHg and maximum temperature at 200 oC. The distillate from this procedure was flowed to the column chromatography of zeolite (ZAA). The compound absorbed by zeolite was eluted with varying solvents, i. e: CCl 4, acetone and ethanol. Each fraction was then analyzed by gas chromatography. The results showed, zeolite have a capability to separate the compounds of tar and it tends to <b>absorb</b> <b>medium</b> hydrocarbon.

40|$|An {{approximate}} {{analytic model}} {{is presented to}} describe spatial structure of refracted electromagnetic field arising at oblique incidence of a Gaussian beam on a plane boundary of an <b>absorbing</b> homogeneous <b>medium.</b> The analytic solution is obtained by asymptotic approximation of a Fourier field integral under the condition of great beam width in comparison with a wavelength (the geometrical-optics approximation). This model can be used also for approximate simulation of refracted field {{in the cases of}} beam incidence near the critical angle on transparent or <b>absorbing</b> (amplifying) refracting <b>medium,</b> if one artificially introduces the additional absorption (amplification), whose value is proportional to the ratio of the wavelength and the effective beam width.

50|$|A basic TDLAS setup {{consists}} of tunable diode laser light source, transmitting (i.e. beam shaping) optics, optically accessible <b>absorbing</b> <b>medium,</b> receiving optics and detector/s. The emission wavelength of the tunable diode laser, viz. VCSEL, DFB, etc., is tuned over the characteristic absorption {{lines of a}} species in the gas {{in the path of}} the laser beam.

50|$|In natural optical activity, the {{difference}} between the LCP light and the RCP light is caused by the asymmetry of the molecules. Because of the handedness of the molecule, the absorption of the LCP light would be different from the RCP light. However, in MCD {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field, LCP and RCP no longer interact equivalently with the <b>absorbing</b> <b>medium.</b> Thus there is not the same direct relation between magnetic optical activity and molecular stereochemistry which would be expected, because it is found in natural optical activity. So, natural CD is much more rare than MCD.|$|E

5000|$|While {{outer space}} {{provides}} the most rarefied example of a naturally occurring partial vacuum, the heavens were originally thought to be seamlessly filled by a rigid indestructible material called aether. Borrowing somewhat from the pneuma of Stoic physics, aether came {{to be regarded as}} the rarefied air from which it took its name, (see Aether (mythology)). Early theories of light posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated. Additionally, the concept informed Isaac Newton's explanations of both refraction and of radiant heat. [...] 19th century experiments into this luminiferous aether attempted to detect a minute drag on the Earth's orbit. While the Earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected. In 1912, astronomer Henry Pickering commented: [...] "While the interstellar <b>absorbing</b> <b>medium</b> may be simply the ether, it is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous molecules are certainly there".|$|E
50|$|A urine sensor is a {{necessary}} part of any bedwetting alarm. A basic urine sensor consists of two electricity conductors separated by moisture absorbing insulating material. A low DC electric voltage, provided by batteries, is applied across these conductors. This low voltage is usually about 3 volts, {{so as not to be}} dangerous to the user. When this insulating material (frequently cotton cloth as in common briefs) absorbs urine, it allows electricity to pass through it and between the conductors, resulting in a small electric current in the conductors. The conductors are attached to an alarm device, which triggers an alarm when it senses this current. Most sensors and alarms are engineered based on this concept. Note that unless the urine reaches the sensor mechanism and adequately wets the briefs (or insulator between the conductors), the urine may not be sensed and the alarm will not activate. Sensors are usually classified in terms of their attachment mechanisms to the briefs or other urine <b>absorbing</b> <b>medium.</b> The major sensor attachment categories are mechanical clips, sticky tape or pads for flat surface sensors, magnetic attachment, and wiring sewed into special briefs.|$|E
50|$|Only a small {{fraction}} of the light incident on the ocean will be reflected and received by the satellite. The probability for a photon to reflect and exit the ocean decreases exponentially with length of its path through the water because the ocean is an <b>absorbing</b> <b>medium.</b> The more ocean a photon must travel through, the greater its chances of being absorbed by something. After absorption, it will eventually become part of the ocean's heat reservoir. The absorption and scattering characteristics of a water body determine the rate of vertical light attenuation and set a limit to the depths contributing to a satellite signal. A reasonable rule of thumb is that 90 percent of the signal coming from the water that is seen by the satellite is from the first attenuation length. How deep this is depends on the absorption and scattering properties of both the water itself and other constituents in the water. For wavelengths in the near infrared and longer, the penetration depth varies from a metre to a few micrometres. For band 1, the penetration depth will usually be between 1 and 10 metres. If the water has a large turbidity spike below 10 metres, the spike is unlikely to be seen by a satellite.|$|E
