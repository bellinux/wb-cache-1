40|$|The {{emergence}} of the Jewish community in Rome {{in the second century}} B.

Dissimilarity of the Jews made them incomprehensible to the pagans and a feeling of resentment <b>aroused</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lack of participation in worship or circumcision. For this reason Judaism was recognized as superstitio. Religious liberty granted to the Jews by Julius Caesar and Augustus began a long process of changing the way Judaism and its followers were perceived. However it did not mean immediate acceptance of the Jewish community, what was particularly evident during the reign of Tiberius, when he expelled them from Rome. In the following years manifestations of hostility towards Jews were especially visible in Alexandria, where a pogrom took place. Usually the action directed against the followers of Judaism occurred because of violations of order in the empire, just like during the first Jewish War. The main motive behind the decisions of the Roman authorities was the suppression of riots and not persecution because of religious differences. Subsequent Jewish revolts against Roman authorities also did not lead to depriving them of religious freedom. Moreover, while the Christian faith was banned during the reign of Trajan, the Jews had permission to practice their religion. Even during the persecution of Christians under Diocletian, the Jewish community was exempt from the obligation to participate in worship, which meant that Judaism was no longer considered dangerous to the old gods, and thus ceased to be superstitio...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} the self-interaction of a quasi-rigid {{classical}} particle with an arbitrary spherically symmetric charge distribution is completely solved up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first order in the acceleration. No ad hoc assumptions are made. It is shown {{that most of the}} puzzles that this problem has <b>aroused</b> are <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inertia of the negative pressure that equilibrates the electrostatic repulsion inside the particle. When the inertia of pressure is taken into account the dressed mass turns out <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> bare mass plus the electrostatic mass m=m_ 0 + m_e. It is shown that a proper mechanical behaviour requires that m_ 0 > m_e/ 3. This condition poses a lower bound on the radius that a particle of a given bare mass and charge may have. The violation of this condition is the reason why the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac formula for the radiation reaction of a point charge predicts unphysical motions that run away or violate causality. Provided the mass condition is met the solutions of the exact equation of motion never run away and conform to causality and energy and momentum conservation.

Anaphora resolution has been a subject of research in computational linguistics for more than 25 years. The interest it <b>aroused</b> was <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> importance that anaphoric phenomena play in the coherence and cohesiveness of natural language. A deep understanding of a text is impossible without knowledge about how individual concepts relate to each other; a shallow understanding of a text is often impeded without resolving anaphoric phenomena. In the larger context of anaphora resolution, pronoun resolution has benefited from a wide interest, with pronominal anaphora being one of the most frequent discourse phenomena. The problem has been approached in a variety of manners, in various languages. The research presented in this thesis approaches the problem of pronoun resolution in the context of multilingual NLP applications. In the global information society we are living in, fast access <b>to</b> information in <b>the</b> language of one’s choice is essential, and this access is facilitated by emerging multilingual NLP applications. As anaphora resolution {{is an integral part of}} many NLP applications, it necessarily has to be approached with the view of multilinguality in mind. The present project describes an original approach to bilingual anaphora resolution, for English and French. The method is based on combining hand crafted rules with automatic learning. Although only designed and tested for English and French, the approach has <b>the</b> potential <b>to</b> be extended <b>to</b> other languages. <b>The</b> steps preceding the practical development of the system consisted in an investigation of common and distinct features of English and French pronominal systems, while the evaluation of the system provided an interesting insight into specific problems relating to bilingual anaphora resolution. ii...|$|R

The results showed no differences between conditions (group vs. solitary) for retrospective emotion ratings; however, the number of validated chills did show a non-significant trend towards experiencing more chills in the solitary listening session. Also, skin conductance responses during chills were significantly higher during the solitary listening condition.

In this paper, a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) study was performed <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> mechanism of plume development over cooling towers, the subsequent moisture transport and the resultant impact on the buildings nearby in a hypothetical dense urban environment. The velocity of the cooling tower exhaust is kept constant under different prevalent wind speed. This configuration examines the velocity ratio (v r) at 0. 33, 0. 83, 1. 53 and 2. 17 for atmospheric condition of light air, light breeze, gentle breeze and moderate breeze respectively. When the v r is 0. 83 and 2. 17 (light breeze), the short-circuiting can occur, in which a representative moisture content can reach up to 17. 5 and 17. 73 gM/kgDA respectively at different distance ratio. This indicates that the discharge air re-enters the cooling tower as some is trapped within the alley. Whilst, as v r increases to 1. 53 (gentle breeze), short-circuiting of cooling tower is reduced to approximately {{by an average of}} 0. 5 gM/kgDA for the specified distance ratio. This is <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stronger upward draught that pushes the exhaust air further up yet still lingers within the alley. The CFD analysis shows that further increase in the prevalent wind speed suppresses the crosswind mixing of cooling tower exhaust, thus further reduces the chance of short-circuiting. This indicates the environment condition affects the severity of plume. More attention should be pay on the potential risk of public health. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} functionalization of endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) has <b>aroused</b> considerable interest <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{possibility of}} synthesizing new species with potential applications in materials science and medicine. Experimental and theoretical {{studies on the}} reactivity of endohedral metallofullerenes are scarce. To improve {{our understanding of the}} endohedral metallofullerene reactivity, we have systematically studied with DFT methods the Diels-Alder cycloaddition between s-cis- 1, 3 -butadiene and practically all X@I h-C 80 EMFs synthesized to date: X=Sc 3 N, Lu 3 N, Y 3 N, La 2, Y 3, Sc 3 C 2, Sc 4 C 2, Sc 3 CH, Sc 3 NC, Sc 4 O 2 and Sc 4 O 3. We have studied both the thermodynamic and kinetic regioselectivity, taking into account the free rotation of the metallic cluster inside the fullerene. This systematic study has been made possible through the use of the frozen cage model (FCM), a computationally cheap approach <b>to</b> accurately predicting <b>the</b> exohedral regioselectivity of cycloaddition reactions in EMFs. Our results show that the EMFs are less reactive than the hollow Ih-C 80 cage. Except for the Y 3 cluster, the additions occur predominantly at the [5, 6] bond. In many cases, however, a mixture of the two possible regioisomers is predicted. In general, [6, 6] addition is favored in EMFs that have a larger charge transfer from <b>the</b> metal cluster <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cage or a voluminous metal cluster inside. The present guide represents the first complete and exhaustive investigation of the reactivity of Ih-C 80 -based EMFsWe are grateful for financial support from the Spanish MICINN (projects CTQ 2011 - 23156 /BQU and CTQ 2011 - 25086 /BQU), the Catalan DIUE (projects 2009 SGR 637, 2009 SGR 528, and XRQTC), and the FEDER fund (grant UNGI 08 - 4 E- 003).

40|$|Tese de Doutoramento (Programa Doutoral em Tecnologias e Sistemas de Informação) The {{challenges}} {{involved in}} developing information systems (which {{are able to}} adapt to rapidly changing business and technological conditions) are directly related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> importance of their alignment with the business counterpart. These challenges comprise issues that cross management and information systems domains, relating and aligning {{them in order to}} attain superior performance for the organization, while identifying its strategy and tailoring its business processes. As this relation is increasingly intertwined its concepts are conducted to pragmatic methods, incorporating both management and information systems components, for how, when and where this alignment really matters. The related topics of the alignment between business and information systems comprise diverse paths of research, though with little common ground established inside the community, where problems <b>arouse</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fast moving business and technological environments. According <b>to</b> these circumstances, <b>the</b> process of developing information systems <b>to</b> support <b>the</b> alignment benefits from incorporating the use of structured and model-based approaches. So, as the development of evermore complex information systems presents a challenge for the currently available methods, the use of models <b>to</b> support <b>the</b> alignment with business stands as an increasingly important issue. Following those challenges, we set out to question how to develop solutions aligning information systems with business in a model-based approach. Accordingly, we support our research on <b>the</b> need <b>to</b> understand what are the perspectives involved in aligning information systems with business, and, moreover, to comprehend in what sense model adoption drives information systems development. So, the proposed goals for this thesis are: (1) set the basis for the elicitation of business requirements in order to support a well-grounded development of information systems; (2) provide for the generation of business models based on the business requirements, while assuring their alignment and traceability; and (3) arrange for the derivation of information system architectures from the business requirements, while attaining alignment and traceability for their mutual transformation and adaptation. Several issues surrounding these goals have already been described and approached in diverse ways by other researchers, where existing approaches and associated methods achieved good results. Nevertheless, these approaches are not without their shortfalls, sometimes failing to present a complete solution, others being unable to adapt to new challenges, or even incapable of reacting to recent trends. In order to tackle these issues we propose to build upon those approaches by adapting, evolving and innovating on solutions {{in each of the three}} proposed goals, respectively intertwining with perspectives from related standards and reference models. Answering the first goal, in what regards the main contributions of this thesis, we propose <b>to</b> broaden <b>the</b> elicitation of requirements by relating functional and nonfunctional requirements from business processes. So, we present a unified metamodel representation for those requirements, accompanied by a customizable method for their joint elicitation, based-on business-driven use-cases, goals and rules. This approach adopts the Rational Unified Process (RUP) development methodology and the Business Motivation Model (BMM) standard model language representation for business requirements. Moreover, the metamodel representation and method operationalization are accompanied by a prototype support tool that completes this first contribution. For the second goal, a more business-oriented one correlated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> higher-level requirements, we propose to generate business models directly from the inferred functional and nonfunctional requirements. So, we present a three-dimensional approach built on the relation of the referred requirements with the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) reference model, where an additional mapping <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Business Model Canvas (BMC) is also made available. This proposal provides an associated metamodel representation for the relation between the elements involved and a customizable method for their operationalization, all accompanied by a prototype support tool. On the third goal, focused on system architectures and connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower-level requirements, we propose to derive service-oriented participants from the functional requirements, while aligning the nonfunctional requirements with the quality characteristics of the solution to-be. First, we present an evolution of an existing method for the derivation of a logical architecture, in order to adapt it to a service-oriented approach (SOA). Then, following on the existing relation between the nonfunctional and functional side of the low-level requirements, our approach is able to associate these last with its related services on the derived architecture, in another three-dimensional approach. Additionally, a mapping of the nonfunctional requirements with the system quality characteristics (CISQ) is made available. Once more, an associated metamodel, a customizable method and a prototype support tool are also provided. The development of these three approaches is supported through the execution of tasks which originate artifacts and lead to publications associated to their respective research and development efforts, all according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Design Science Research (DSR) methodology. These are applied in ongoing projects involving experimental scenarios in industrial settings and associated to established research reference patterns, balancing the interests of both researchers and practitioners while focused both on technology and management audiences. The results obtained from their evaluation reflect the quality and depth of our findings, helping <b>to</b> validate <b>the</b> scientific contribution of this work. Os desafios implicados no desenvolvimento de sistemas de informação (que sejam capazes de se adaptar a condições tecnológicas e de negócios em rápida mutação) estão diretamente relacionados à importância do seu alinhamento com a contraparte do negócio. Esses desafios envolvem questões que cruzam os domínios da gestão e dos sistemas de informação, relacionando-os e alinhando-os com o intuito de alcançar um desempenho superior para a organização, ao mesmo tempo que identificam a sua estratégia e adequam os seus processos de negócio. Como esta relação está cada vez mais interligada, os seus conceitos são canalizados para métodos pragmáticos, incorporando ambos os componentes de sistemas de informação e de gestão, para saber como, quando e onde este alinhamento realmente interessa. Os tópicos relacionados com o alinhamento entre negócio e sistemas de informação abrangem diversos caminhos de pesquisa, embora com poucos alicerces em comum estabelecidos dentro da comunidade, onde os problemas surgem devido às rápidas mudanças nos negócios e nos ambientes tecnológicos. De acordo com estas circunstâncias, o processo de desenvolvimento de sistemas de informação para apoiar o alinhamento beneficia de incorporar o uso de abordagens estruturadas e baseadas em modelos. Assim, dado que o desenvolvimento de sistemas de informação cada vez mais complexos apresenta um desafio para os métodos atualmente disponíveis, o uso de modelos para apoiar o alinhamento com o negócio destaca-se como uma questão cada vez mais importante. Em linha com esses desafios, estabelecemos a questão de como desenvolver soluções para alinhar sistemas de informações com o negócio numa abordagem baseada em modelos. Neste sentido, apoiamos a nossa pesquisa na necessidade de compreender quais são as perspetivas envolvidas no alinhamento dos sistemas de informação com o negócio, e, além disso, de compreender em que sentido a adoção de modelos capacita o desenvolvimento desses sistemas. Assim, os objetivos propostos para esta tese são: (1) definir as bases para o levantamento de requisitos de negócio a fim de suportar um desenvolvimento bem fundamentado de sistemas de informação; (2) disponibilizar a geração de modelos de negócio baseados nos requisitos de negócio, garantindo o alinhamento e a rastreabilidade entre ambos; e (3) estruturar a derivação de arquiteturas de sistema de informação a partir dos requisitos de negócio, preservando o alinhamento e rastreabilidade para a sua mútua transformação e adaptação. Várias questões envolvendo estes objetivos foram já descritas e tratadas de diversas maneiras por outros investigadores, tendo as abordagens existentes e os métodos associados alcançado bons resultados. No entanto, essas abordagens têm as suas lacunas, umas vezes falham em apresentar uma solução completa, noutras são ineficientes ao se adaptarem a novos desafios, ou mesmo incapazes de reagir às novas tendências. Para lidar com estas questões, propomo-nos apoiar nessas abordagens, adaptando, evoluindo e inovando em soluções para cada um dos três objetivos propostos, intersetando-as, respetivamente, com perspetivas de modelos de referência e padrões relacionados. Relativamente ao primeiro objetivo, no que concerne aos principais contributos desta tese, propomos alargar o levantamento de requisitos, relacionando os requisitos funcionais e nãofuncionais dos processos de negócios. Assim, apresentamos um meta-modelo para a representação unificada desses requisitos, acompanhado por um método personalizável para o seu levantamento conjunto, baseada em casos-de-uso, metas e regras orientadas a negócio. Esta abordagem adota a metodologia de desenvolvimento do Rational Unified Process (RUP) e a representação padrão do modelo de linguagem do Business Motivation Model (BMM), para os requisitos de negócio. Além disso, a representação meta-modelo e a operacionalização do método são acompanhados por um protótipo de uma ferramenta de suporte que completa esta primeira contribuição. Quanto ao segundo objetivo, mais orientado ao negócio e correlacionado com os requisitos de nível superior, propomos gerar modelos de negócio a partir dos requisitos funcionais e não-funcionais inferidos. Assim, apresentamos uma abordagem tridimensional, construída sobre a relação dos referidos requisitos com o modelo de referência do Balanced Scorecard (BSC), em que um mapeamento adicional para o Business Model Canvas (BMC) é também disponibilizado. Esta proposta inclui um meta-modelo para representação da relação entre os elementos envolvidos e um método personalizável para a sua operacionalização, tudo acompanhado por um protótipo de uma ferramenta de suporte. No terceiro objetivo, focado em arquiteturas de sistema e ligado aos requisitos de nível inferior, propomos derivar participantes orientados-a-serviços desde os requisitos funcionais, alinhando os requisitos não-funcionais com as características de qualidade da solução a obter. Primeiro, apresentamos uma evolução de um método existente para a derivação de uma arquitetura lógica, adaptando-o a uma abordagem-orientada-a-serviços (SOA). Assim, prosseguindo a relação existente entre o lado não-funcional e funcional dos requisitos de baixo nível, a nossa abordagem associa estes últimos com os serviços relacionados na arquitetura derivada, numa outra abordagem tridimensional. Além disso, um mapeamento dos requisitos não-funcionais com as características de qualidade do sistema (CISQ) é disponibilizado. Mais uma vez, um meta-modelo associado, um método personalizável e um protótipo da ferramenta de suporte são disponibilizados. O desenvolvimento destas três abordagens é suportado pela execução de tarefas, as quais dão origem a artefatos e levam a publicações associadas aos seus esforços de pesquisa e desenvolvimento respetivamente, tudo de acordo com a metodologia DSR. Estas são aplicadas a projetos em andamento, os quais envolvem cenários experimentais em ambientes industriais e associados a padrões de investigação de referência, equilibrando os interesses de investigadores e profissionais assim como dos diferentes públicos de tecnologia e gestão. Os resultados obtidos na sua avaliação refletem a qualidade e a profundidade dos nossos resultados, ajudando a validar a contribuição científica deste trabalho...|$|R
