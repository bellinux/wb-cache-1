5|$|In {{the late}} 1790s, Paine fled from France to the United States, where he wrote Part III of The Age of Reason: <b>An</b> <b>Examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Passages in the New Testament, Quoted from the Old and Called Prophecies Concerning Jesus Christ. Fearing {{unpleasant}} and even violent reprisals, Thomas Jefferson convinced {{him not to}} publish it in 1802; five years later Paine decided to publish despite the backlash he knew would ensue.|$|E
5|$|On April 14, 2017, Representative Earl Blumenauer {{introduced}} the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act.

5|$|An {{attempt to}} open a sealed chamber using a Borazon drill fails to make progress. However, a few moments after the drill is stopped, a small hole is seen, though the drill operator, Sladden (Duncan Lamont), is certain it was not created by his machine. The hole widens to reveal the corpses of three-legged, insectoid creatures with horned heads. Roney and Judd work to {{preserve}} the bodies before they decay. <b>An</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creatures' physiology suggests {{they came from the}} planet Mars. Quatermass and Roney note the similarity between the appearance of the creatures and images of the Devil.|$|E

The blood stains found inside the Ford Corsair were of the AB blood group; the report concluded that this might have been a mixture of blood from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found inside the car.|$|E
5|$|During <b>an</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Son's body, Mulder discovers {{a tattoo}} for Club Tepes, a local vampire club. There, {{he comes across}} a young woman named Kristen Kilar who partakes in the {{consumption}} of blood. Mulder, having his suspicion aroused, follows Kristen after she and another club patron, David Yung, leave for an erotic liaison; he initially fears that Kristen is targeting Yung, but is beaten by Yung when he catches the agent spying on them. After Mulder leaves, Yung is murdered by the three killers, although the reason is not known.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, <b>an</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pylon {{attachment}} points revealed {{damage to}} the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched {{the shape of the}} pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed {{damage to the}} rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E

For the festival's first event, New York City high-school students interviewed robotics expert Cynthia Breazeal and physicist Leon Lederman on-stage, moderated by MTV's SuChin Pak. Another event was presented by the Disney Imagineers, who explored the science of special effects and amusement park technology, from roller coasters and fireworks to motion capture and artificial fog.|$|E
5|$|Passport to Pimlico {{explores the}} spirit and unity of wartime London in a post-war context and offers <b>an</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English character. Like other of the Ealing comedies, the film pits {{a small group of}} British against a series of changes to the status quo from an {{external}} agent. The story was an original concept by the screenwriter T. E. B. Clarke. He was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government so that when Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth, the baby was born on Dutch territory, and would not lose her right to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Russell replaces Mill's {{analysis}} with <b>an</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issue from four perspectives: {{the perspective of}} the governor, the citizen, the innovator, and the philosopher. The rational governor is always threatened by revolutionary activities, and can always be expected to ban speech which calls for assassination. Yet the governor would be advised to allow freedom of speech to prevent and diminish discontent among the subjects, and has no reason to suppress ideas which are unrelated to his governance, for instance the Copernican doctrine of heliocentrism. Relatedly, the citizen mainly understands free speech {{as an extension of the}} right to do peaceably that which could only otherwise be done through violence (Russell 1938:179–182).|$|E

5|$|The executioner was masked and disguised, {{and there}} is debate over his identity. The commissioners {{approached}} Richard Brandon, the common hangman of London, but he refused, at least at first, despite being offered £200. It is possible he relented and undertook the commission after being threatened with death, {{but there are others}} who have been named as potential candidates, including George Joyce, William Hulet and Hugh Peters. The clean strike, confirmed by <b>an</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king's body at Windsor in 1813, suggests that the execution was carried out by an experienced headsman.|$|E

Chafe, whose feet had become gangrenous after severe frostbite, had his toes removed by second engineer Williamson, with improvised tools. McKinlay and Munro risked their lives by travelling over the sea ice towards Herald Island, in a final effort to locate either of the missing parties.

The first of these, entitled South African Customs Union, was written in 1890 in competition for the JB Ebden prize offered by the University of the Cape of Good Hope. This essay, <b>an</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic relations of the colonies and states of South Africa, though 'Highly Commended' by the judges, failed to win the prize. Nevertheless, despite achieving only modest success, it is unsurpassed as a clear and authoritative statement of Smuts's political outlook at this time.|$|E

5|$|Witnesses near King at {{the moment}} of his death said that the shot came from another location.

However, Ray's fingerprints were found on various objects (a rifle, a pair of binoculars, articles of clothing, a newspaper) that were left in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from. <b>An</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rifle containing Ray's fingerprints also determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm {{at the time of the}} assassination.|$|E
