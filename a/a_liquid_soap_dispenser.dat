The functions of the entire <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> are almost same which is to dispense <b>a</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>soap.</b> The main objective of the project was to design and develop a multipurpose <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> prototype.

The process of development may be conducted based on several tools of idea and concept generation such as New Product Development (NPD) and Design for Manufacturing (DFM). The development was focused on the additional functions and performance of the product. Another wish was to increase consistency and reliability of the prototyped product. An initial pre-study gave insight in how to come out with multipurpose functions that can be adapted into the <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser.</b> A wide variety of <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> and the other hygiene care product were studied to obtain complete understanding.

Regardless of manufacture and design of a hand rub or <b>liquid</b> <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> the following requirements shall be met in healthcare facilities: Triggering the dispenser must be possible without using hands. Sensor- or elbow-operated dispensers both fulfill this requirement. Dispensers must be only refillable in a modality where the content, be it a hand rub or <b>liquid</b> <b>soap,</b> cannot be contaminated. This is achieved best by using replaceable cartridge systems. Refilling through “top-up” must not be possible. The disperser should allow usage of different types of cartridges made by different manufacturers. Dispensers must be operated and maintained such that a microbial contamination of the pump nozzle may easily be avoided. It must be possible to identify the products used in a dispenser easily and without any manipulation. Identifying the type of product, be it a hand rub or <b>a</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>soap,</b> as well as reading the product's name and critical manufacturers' warnings must be possible at any time. The disperser must allow identification of the level of the used product without any further manipulation at any time. The design of the dispenser must allow easy cleaning and disinfection the outside and inside of the dispenser. The manufacturer of the dispenser must provide the user with information on applicable chemicals and cleaning products. It must be possible to reprocess the dispenser and all of its permanent parts by applying machine based thermal disinfection at an A 0 -value of minimum 60 (e. g. 80 °C/ 1 minute). Automatically portioning dispensers shall not fail during 200 hubs. The maximal allowed failure rate shall not exceed 1 % (2 out of 200 consecutive hubs). A dispenser used for alcohol based hand rubs must allow keeping the alcohol concentration constant over a time period of 3 months. The maximum acceptable decrease in the concentration of the alcohol shall not exceed 5 %. <b>Liquid</b> <b>soap</b> and hand rub dispensers with single-use pumps, ideally already mounted on the cartridge and to be discharged with the empty cartridge, are preferable. If pumps are used on the next consecutive cartridge, the manufacturer must provide the user with a detailed introduction for cleansing and reprocessing before further use. Because of forensic reasons it is recommended to place a good readable sign on the dispenser indicating e. g. “Apply alcohol based hand rubs only on the hand! Do not drink, avoid spraying into the eye or application on mucous membranes”. It is regarded as an additional benefit, if the dispenser is able to document the consumption of hand rub or the frequency of hubs either mechanically or electronically...|$|R

Hence, the aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of <b>a</b> formulated <b>liquid</b> <b>soap</b> from this essence as a new hygienic/therapeutic product. Materials and methods : 0. 5 of the essence was extracted from the lavender plant and added to <b>a</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>soap</b> base prepared in preliminary studies, then the prepared product was evaluated in terms of the visual characteristics, color, odor, cleansing and foaming ability, ease of washing from the skin, skin softening ability, compatibility with the skin, PH, and total active determination of the product, determination of the volume and durability of the foam and mechanical and thermal stability. Results : The prepared product had a clear appearance. It was homogenous, with a suitable viscosity and free of suspended particles or sedimentation and possess a pleasant odor.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{exposure}} to mild irritants including cleansing and antiseptic products used for hand hygiene generates insults to the skin. To avoid unpleasant reactions, skin protection creams are commonly employed, but some fail to afford protection against {{a variety of}} xenobiotics. In this study, two skin protection creams were assayed comparatively looking for a protective effect if any against <b>a</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>soap</b> and <b>an</b> alcohol-based gel designed for hand hygiene in medical settings. Methods Corneosurfametry and corneoxenometry are two in vitro bioessays which were selected for their good reproducibility, sensitivity and ease of use. A Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test followed by the Dunn test was realized to compare series of data obtained. Results Significant differences in efficacy were obtained between the two assayed skin protection creams. One of the two tested creams showed a real protective effect against mild irritants, but the other tested cream presented an irritant potential in its application with mild irritants. Conclusion The differences observed for the two tested skin protection creams were probably due to their galenic composition and their possible interactions with the offending products. As a result, the present in vitro bioassays showed contrasted effects of the creams corresponding to either a protective or an irritant effect on human stratum corneum. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} that the organization of cells into columns in the mammalian epidermis may {{be a result of}} the close packing of these cells has been investigated in a model system involving the association of randomly produced soap bubbles into a stable truth. Upon floating to the surface of <b>a</b> <b>liquid,</b> <b>soap</b> bubbles have been found to spontaneously assemble into precise columns of interdigitating bubbles. The tetrakaidecahedral shape and the spatial configuration of these bubbles closely resemble those of stacked epidermal cells, although the columns of a froth were oriented at a 60 ° angle to their substratum rather than at right angles as occurs in the epidermal cell columns. These observations lend support to the theory that the organization of the cells in the epidermis into columns is due to the assumption of the keratocytes of a minimum surface-close packing array. Such an organizing mechanism would be independent of both positional control of the underlying mitoses and active guidance of the cells as they become superficially displaced within the epidermis. The observation that a high rate of cell turnover is incompatible with the epidermal column structure {{may be related to the}} finding that rapidly produced soap bubbles do not, at least initially, assemble into a columnar array...|$|R
