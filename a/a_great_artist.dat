5|$|Elvis Presley is {{a supreme}} figure in American life, one whose presence, {{no matter how}} banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons.... The {{cultural}} range of his music has expanded {{to the point where}} it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues.... Elvis has emerged as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>artist,</b> a great rocker, a great purveyor of schlock, a great heart throb, a great bore, a great symbol of potency, a great ham, a great nice person, and, yes, a great American.|$|E
25|$|I {{am deeply}} {{saddened by the}} death of my close friend and colleague, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, whose death today at his home deprives us all of <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>artist</b> and an even greater human being. Almost every tribute paid to Sir Alfred in the past by film critics and historians has {{emphasised}} his continuing influence in the world of film. It is that continuing influence, embodied in the magnificent series of films he has given the world, during the last half-century, that will preserve his great spirit, his humour and his wit, not only for us but for succeeding generations of film-goers.|$|E

She becomes <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>artist</b> and eventually has a daughter who she decided to name Mai; Mai, the sister, eventually meets her {{in the future and}} at first mistakes her for Konami. When Mai, the sister, returns to be with Konami after meeting with Konami, she asks Konami to teach her daughter that both of them enjoyed their friendship and never resented the other for leaving, hoping to change the personality of Mai. Konami is voiced by Miki Haruse in the visual novel, by Tomoko Kawakami in the Japanese anime, and by Tabitha St. Germain in the English anime.|$|E

25|$|Ernő Zórád {{ended his}} {{professional}} relationship with Tibor Cs. Horváth and wrote his own comic scripts. Luckily Zórád {{was not just}} <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>artist,</b> but also a talented storyteller: these comics came {{much closer to the}} medium's own language. He also made experimental collage comics in the early seventies attracting international attention. These works were invited to the Salone Internazionale del Comics festival in 1970 but his portfolio – due to Hungarian bureaucracy – has arrived late. Furthermore, the works has been stolen from the festival. By the late seventies the classic trio of Hungarian comics creators disappeared: Korcsmáros died in 1975, Sebők died in 1980 and Zórád retired temporarily. Since young talents were not introduced during the preceding three decades (except for Attila Fazekas), many mark these years the end of Hungarian comics' golden age.|$|E

500|$|The {{perceived}} lack {{of respect}} shown to one of England's leading artists led to some outcry, and attacks in the press upon the then very unpopular Albert; William Makepeace Thackeray wrote in 1845: [...] "Think of the greatest patronage in the world giving forty pounds for pictures worth four hundred—condescending to buy works from humble men who could not refuse, and paying for them below their value! Think of august powers and principalities ordering the works of such <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>artist</b> as Etty to be hacked out of the palace-wall!

500|$|Despite Morello, Wilk and Commerford's {{involvement}} in Prophets of Rage, Commerford confirmed {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone that Rage Against the Machine has not split up, explaining, [...] "We just do things our own way. Throughout our career, we never did what anyone wanted us to do. We never made the records people wanted us to make. We never played by the rules people wanted us to play by. And here we are, 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But where are they now? They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm sure will be fantastic—he's <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>artist</b> in his own right.

500|$|Under {{the heading}} [...] "Transcendental Mediocrity", Jim Miller of Rolling Stone called Dark Horse a [...] "disastrous album" [...] {{to match the}} [...] "disastrous tour", and a [...] "shoddy piece of work". According to Miller, the musicians were [...] "merely {{competent}} studio pros" [...] and Harrison's guitar playing was [...] "rudimentary". In contrast with the praise that the same publication had lavished on Harrison for Living in the Material World the year before, Rolling Stones reviewer described Dark Horse as a [...] "chronicle of a performer out of his element, working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver new 'LP product'", and stated: [...] "In plain point of fact, George Harrison has never been <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>artist...</b> the question becomes whether he will ever again become a competent entertainer." [...] The NMEs Bob Woffinden derided Harrison's songwriting, production and vocals, particularly on two tracks dealing with his troubled personal life, [...] "Simply Shady" [...] and [...] "So Sad". Woffinden concluded: [...] "I find Dark Horse {{the product of a}} complete egoist – no one, you see, is in my tree – someone whose universe is confined to himself. And his guru... I'll repeat that this album is totally colourless. Just stuff and nonsense." [...] Writing in The Village Voice in January 1975, Robert Christgau bemoaned the album's [...] "transubstantiations" [...] and particularly derided the lyrics to [...] "Māya Love", [...] "in which 'window-pane' becomes 'window brain.' Can this mean that pain (pane, get it?) is the same as brain? For all this hoarse dork knows ..." ...|$|E
500|$|When President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva {{took office}} in January 2003, he chose Gil as Brazil's new Minister of Culture, only the second black person {{to serve in the}} country's cabinet. The {{appointment}} was controversial among political and artistic figures and the Brazilian press; a remark Gil made about difficulties with his salary received particular criticism. Gil is not a member of Lula's Workers' Party and did not participate in creating its cultural program. Shortly after becoming Minister, Gil began a partnership between Brazil and Creative Commons. As Minister, he has sponsored a program called Culture Points, which gives grants to provide music technology and education to people living in poor areas of the country's cities. Gil has since asserted that [...] "You've now got young people who are becoming designers, who are making it into media and being used more and more by television and samba schools and revitalizing degraded neighborhoods. It's a different vision of the role of government, a new role." [...] Gil has also expressed interest in a program that will establish an Internet repository of freely downloadable Brazilian music. Since Gil's appointment, the department's expenditures have increased by over 50percent. In November 2007 Gil announced his intention to resign from his post due to a vocal cord polyp. Lula rejected Gil's first two attempts to resign, but accepted another request in July 2008. Lula said on this occasion that Gil was [...] "going back to being <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>artist,</b> going back to giving priority to what is most important" [...] to him.|$|E
