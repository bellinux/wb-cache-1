It {{tends to be}} located {{at the back of}} the head, either on the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of <b>all</b> <b>cases</b> of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E

The table does not differentiate between types of DCS, or types of symptom.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{credited}} with divine power himself, the pharaoh, as a sacred king, was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of maat.
