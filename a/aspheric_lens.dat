50|$|In some cases, more {{aesthetic}} <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> designs can be fitted, reducing Scotoma {{associated with}} lenticulars.|$|E
5000|$|An {{ophthalmic}} [...] "aspheric lens" [...] specifically {{refers to}} a subclass of <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens.</b> Designs referring to [...] "flatter" [...] curves are trading off optical quality for cosmetic appearance. An <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> attempts to correct the error induced by flattening the lens by using a non-spheric lens shape. Typically the design focuses on reducing the error (OAE) across the horizontal and vertical lens axis edges. This can be primarily beneficial to farsighted individuals, whose lenses have a thick center.|$|E
50|$|Like other lenses for vision correction, <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> can be {{categorized}} as convex or concave.|$|R
5000|$|While in {{principle}} aspheric surfaces {{can take a}} wide variety of forms, <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> are often designed with surfaces of the form ...|$|R
50|$|In lens systems, {{the effect}} can be {{minimized}} using special combinations of convex and concave lenses, as well as using <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> or aplanatic lenses.|$|R
5000|$|Aspherical — <b>Aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> elements. Also Hybrid used: Thin molded {{aspheric}} elements {{coupled to}} a conventional glass element. This designation appears in specifications but not lens names.|$|E
50|$|An atoric lens design {{refers to}} a lens with more complex <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> design. An atoric lens design can address error over more corners of the lens, not just the {{horizontal}} and vertical axis.|$|E
50|$|An <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> or asphere is a lens whose surface {{profiles}} are not {{portions of}} a sphere or cylinder. In photography, a lens assembly that includes an aspheric element {{is often called}} an aspherical lens.|$|E
50|$|Von Rohr {{is usually}} {{credited}} with {{the design of the}} first <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> for eyeglasses. He invented the eyeglass lens designs that became the Zeiss Punktal lenses.|$|R
5|$|Ibn Sahl (ca. 940–1000) {{discovered}} {{the law of}} refraction known as Snell's law. He used the law to produce the first <b>Aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> that focused light without geometric aberrations.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method for}} {{producing}} <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> is by depositing optical resin onto a spherical lens {{to form a}} composite lens of aspherical shape. Plasma ablation has also been proposed.|$|R
50|$|Alternative {{methods of}} diamond {{machining}} in practice also include diamond fly cutting and diamond milling. Diamond fly cutting {{can be used}} to generate diffraction gratings and other linear patterns with appropriately contoured diamond shapes. Diamond milling {{can be used to}} generate <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> arrays by annulus cutting methods with a spherical diamond tool.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem with}} {{aspheric}} lenses {{is that they}} are a broad category. A lens is made of two curved surfaces, and an <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> is a lens where one or both of those surfaces is not spherical. Further research and development is being conducted to determine if the mathematical and theoretical benefits of aspheric lenses can actually lead to better vision correction.|$|E
5000|$|As camera phone {{technology}} has progressed over the years, the lens design {{has evolved from}} a simple double Gauss or Cooke triplet to many molded plastic <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> elements made with varying dispersion and refractive indexes. The latest generation of phone cameras also apply distortion (optics), vignetting, and various optical aberration corrections to the image before it is compressed into a [...]jpeg format.' ...|$|E
50|$|In 1982, Cosina {{began to}} {{manufacture}} lenses {{in a variety}} of SLR manufacturers' lens mounts. In 1991, it started to produce glass molded <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses,</b> and in 1996 plastic molded aspherical lenses. Cosina began producing digital cameras in 1997.|$|R
40|$|The {{controllability}} of {{stiffness of}} bonnet tool polishing large <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> was studied, aiming {{to ensure the}} high stability and uniform removal rate of bonnet tool in polishing process. After analyzing the force situation of bonnet tool when polishing large <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses,</b> the stiffness of the bonnet tool was calculated, and then influencing factors of stiffness of bonnet tool and the effects brought by stiffness of bonnet in polishing process were discussed. After that, control algorithm of bonnet tool was designed and simulated experiments were carried out, the results revealed that the controllability of stiffness of bonnet tool in polishing process could be achieved, which verified the correctness of the control algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Four {{types of}} {{commercial}} <b>aspheric</b> aphakic <b>lenses</b> were assessed {{with respect to}} mass, spectacle magnification, off-axis power errors, and peripheral distortion. The <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> have better distortion and off-axis imagery properties than spherical flat back lenses, but the improvement in distortion properties is small for those lenses whose design form specifies a flattish back surface. The claims concerning the distortion properties of these lenses are exaggerated. The shape (bending) of lenses has a large effect on spectacle magnification, peripheral distortion, and off-axis imager...|$|R
5000|$|The world's first commercial, mass-produced <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> element was {{manufactured}} by Elgeet {{for use in}} the Golden Navitar 12 mm [...] normal lens for use on 16 mm movie cameras in 1956. (See Image sensor format.) This lens received a great deal of industry acclaim during its day. The aspheric elements were created by the use of a membrane polishing technique.|$|E
50|$|The optical {{quality of}} a lens system can be tested in an optics or physics {{laboratory}} using bench apertures, optic tubes, lenses, and a source. Refractive and reflective optical properties can be tabulated {{as a function of}} wavelength, to approximate system performances; tolerances and errors can also be evaluated. In addition to focal integrity, <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> systems can be tested for aberrations before being deployed.|$|E
50|$|Spherical {{aberration}} occurs due to {{the increased}} refraction of light rays that occurs when rays strike a lens, or a reflection of light rays that occurs when rays strike a mirror near its edge in comparison with those that strike nearer the center. This {{is dependent on the}} focal length of a spherical lens and the distance from its center. It is compensated by designing a multi-lens system or by using an <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> {{are also}} {{sometimes}} used for eyeglasses. <b>Aspheric</b> eyeglass <b>lenses</b> allow for crisper vision than standard [...] "best form" [...] lenses, mostly when looking in other directions than the lens optical center. Moreover, {{the reduction of}} the magnification effect of a lens may help with prescriptions that have different powers in the 2 eyes (anisometropia). Not related to the optical quality, they may give a thinner lens, and also distort the viewer's eyes less as seen by other people, producing better aesthetic appearance.|$|R
25|$|More complex are <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses.</b> These are lenses {{where one}} or both {{surfaces}} have a shape that is neither spherical nor cylindrical. The more complicated shapes allow such lenses to form images with less aberration than standard simple lenses, but they are more difficult and expensive to produce.|$|R
40|$|Movement {{modeling}} and control for bonnet tool polishing large axisymmetrical <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> is present. The intersection {{point of the}} spin axis and the bonnet is selected to be object, after analyzing the structure of bonnet tool and process feature of large axisymmetrical <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> polishing; a base coordinate is set up with the centre of bonnet to be its origin point. As the included angle of the spin axis of bonnet tool and the local normal is fixed in continuous precession polishing, a corresponding coordinate is set up to get the position parameters of the intersection point of the spin axis and the bonnet when polishing a random point, the position parameters of the intersection point of the spin axis and the bonnet in base coordinate are got according to space coordinate conversion; Movement model is obtained by space matrix transformation, based on the surface equation of large axisymmetrix <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses,</b> processing control model and the position parameters got in last step; Finally, most efficiency algorithm {{is added to the}} movement model, and precession motion curve is got by simulation. The correctness of movement model and control algorithm is confirmed through simulating the trend of spin axis of bonnet follows the local normal and comparing the simulated value of precession angle with the actual value of precession angle. 漏 2012 Journal of Mechanical Engineering...|$|R
50|$|A Schmidt {{corrector}} {{plate is}} an <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> {{which is designed}} to correct the spherical aberration in the spherical primary mirror it is combined with. It was invented by Bernhard Schmidt in 1931, although it may have been independently invented by Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä in 1924 (sometimes called the Schmidt-Väisälä camera). Schmidt originally designed it as part of a wide-field photographic catadioptric telescope, the Schmidt camera, and is also used in other telescope designs, camera lenses and image projection systems.|$|E
50|$|The non-spherical {{curvature}} of an <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> {{can also be}} created by blending from a spherical into an aspherical curvature by grinding the curvatures off-axis. Dual rotating axis grinding {{can be used for}} high index glass that isn't easily spin molded, as the CR-39 resin lens is. Techniques such as laser ablation {{can also be used to}} modify the {{curvature of}} a lens, but the polish quality of the resulting surfaces is not as good as those achieved with lapidary techniques.|$|E
50|$|The typical SAF setup {{consists}} of a laser line (typically 450-633 nm), which is reflected into the <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> by a dichroic mirror. The lens focuses the laser beam in the sample, causing the particles to fluoresce. The fluorescent light then passes through a parabolic lens before reaching a detector, typically a photomultiplier tube or avalanche photodiode detector. It is also possible to arrange SAF elements as arrays, and image the output onto a CCD, allowing the detection of multiple analytes.|$|E
25|$|With {{properly}} polished single-mode fibers, the emitted beam has {{an almost}} perfect Gaussian shape—even {{in the far}} field—if a good lens is used. The lens needs to {{be large enough to}} support the full numerical aperture of the fiber, and must not introduce aberrations in the beam. <b>Aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> are typically used.|$|R
50|$|The {{dimensions}} of the optical elements that can be moulded depend {{on the size of}} the moulding machine.The precision glass moulding process is not limited to small optics. For the right element geometry, it can enable economical production of <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> up to 60 mm in diameter and more than 20 mm thick.|$|R

50|$|In {{comparison}} to telephoto lenses, shorter focal length objectives benefit less from low-dispersion elements, as their chief problem is spherical aberration instead of chromatic aberration. The spherical aberration {{introduced by the}} LD elements can be corrected with <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> elements. The increased sharpness provided by SLD elements allows using lower f-numbers and therefore faster shutter speed. This is critical, e.g., in sports photography and wildlife photography. The shallow depth of field provided by a telephoto lens also allows {{the subject of the}} photography to stand out better against the background.|$|E
5000|$|His boldness lies in {{realizing that}} he could {{eliminate}} the spherical aberration by placing a thin, very weakly curved <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> (now called the [...] "Schmidt corrector plate") at the same center of curvature as the apertured diaphragm. This <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> has a complex curve that is convex near its middle and concave near its periphery that creates the opposite spherical aberration of the spherical mirror it is paired with, canceling out the mirror's spherical aberration. In this way, very neatly and simply he could construct a large camera of f/1.75 or even faster, that would give sharp images across a field more than 15 degrees in diameter, {{making it possible to}} image large swathes of sky with short exposures (on the order of a few minutes versus an hour or more with a conventional reflector). His first camera had an aperture of about 360mm or 14.5" [...] in diameter, and a focal ratio of f/1.75. It is now housed in a museum at the Hamburg Observatory. Schmidt's combining of diverse optical elements (a special mirror, a diaphragm at a particular location, and a [...] "correction plate") into a simple catadioptric system, based on reasoning from first principles, was epoch making. In particular, the [...] "correction plate" [...] was like nothing ever seen before in telescope design. After Schmidt a flood of new catadioptric designs appeared in the subsequent decades.|$|E
50|$|The asphere's {{more complex}} surface profile can reduce or {{eliminate}} spherical aberration and also reduce other optical aberrations such as astigmatism, compared to a simple lens. A single <b>aspheric</b> <b>lens</b> can often replace a much more complex multi-lens system. The resulting device is smaller and lighter, and sometimes cheaper than the multi-lens design. Aspheric elements {{are used in the}} design of multi-element wide-angle and fast normal lenses to reduce aberrations. They are also used in combination with reflective elements (catadioptric systems) such as the aspherical Schmidt corrector plate used in the Schmidt cameras and the Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes. Small molded aspheres are often used for collimating diode lasers.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} manufacture of controlled bonnet polishing system used for large <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> polishing. Kinematics simulations of the designed structure show that, the workspace of the spin axis of bonnet tool can meet the requirement of large <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> polishing with continuous precession processing. A polishing experiment on the circular flat workpiece with a radius of 320 mm has been carried out. The profile accuracy of the workpiece is fine after 24 -hour polishing. The surface roughness reduces from 0. 272 位 to 0. 068 位, and the peak-to-valley value reduces from 1. 671 位 to 0. 905 位. The results of the experiment show that the controlled bonnet polishing system is featured with high precision and high stability, meeting the design requirements, and the system can improve the profile accuracy of workpieces effectively...|$|R
50|$|Excavations at the Viking harbour town of Fröjel, Gotland, Sweden {{discovered}} in 1999 the rock crystal Visby lenses, produced by turning on pole lathes at Fröjel in the 11th to 12th century, with an imaging quality {{comparable to that}} of 1950s <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses.</b> The Viking lenses were capable of concentrating enough sunlight to ignite fires.|$|R
50|$|With modern {{computer-controlled}} design, grinding {{and polishing}} techniques, good vision corrections can be achieved for even wider angles of view by allowing certain deviations from the toric shape. This is called an atoric lens (literally, non-toric lens). They are related to toric lenses {{in the same way}} that <b>aspheric</b> <b>lenses</b> are related to spherical lenses.|$|R
