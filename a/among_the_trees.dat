5|$|On 12 October, French troops {{backed by}} tanks, {{artillery}} and aerial support launched an operation to surround and eliminate al-Kharrat's rebels in the al-Zur forest. Al-Kharrat's men were forewarned of the French deployment by the peasants of al-Malihah. Positioned <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> the rebels used sniper fire against the French troops. The latter {{were unable to}} lure the rebels out and retreated.|$|E
5|$|With the {{darkness}} and fog, Mexican soldiers could not estimate how many men had surrounded them. They withdrew 300 yards (meters) to a nearby bluff. At about 6am, Texians emerged from the trees and began firing at the Mexican soldiers. Lieutenant Gregorio Pérez counterattacked with 40 mounted soldiers. The Texians fell back to the trees and fired a volley, injuring a Mexican private. According to some accounts, the cannon {{fell out of the}} wagon upon the shot. Unable to safely maneuver <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> the Mexican horsemen returned to the bluff.|$|E

Many fine houses are located <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> of the city's Town Belt, which snakes around the slopes of the crest which surrounds much of the inner city. Unlike neighbouring hill suburbs like Roslyn, Maori Hill was not served by a cable car, possibly underlying its greater degree of exclusivity. Maori Hill's 2001 population was 1,956. Prospect Park, a small suburb centred on the park of the same name, is sited at the northern end of the ridge which runs through the hill suburbs south to Lookout Point, overlooking the broad canyon of the Leith Valley.|$|E
25|$|German {{infantry}} massing for a counter-attack {{during the}} afternoon at the higher end of the valley between Polderhoek and the Gheluvelt Spur was easily seen and a Stokes mortar was moved to Jericho. The crew opened rapid fire, which sent the German troops running for cover, casting away rifles and equipment. Very few of the Germans reached Gheluvelt, no attack followed and German stretcher-bearers under a Red Cross flag were allowed off the Menin road to rescue wounded for several hours. During the evening {{a large number of}} German reinforcements came up to the château and some were shot down by Lewis gunners. Braithwaite wanted another attack after dark, possibly an enveloping movement from the Reutelbeek but the German reinforcements, the vigilance of the château garrison and the doubtful situation on the New Zealand left led to caution. The only troops available were the reserve companies and parties from the support companies. If these troops attacked, the New Zealand positions would be vulnerable to a repulse on the left flank. During the night the area on the left flank south of the Reutelbeek was consolidated but the full moon came up and illuminated the ground. New Zealand stretcher-bearers searched the shell holes <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> under machine-gun fire and got the wounded away by first light.|$|E

Located on {{what was once a}} 36,000-square-meter estate, Tropicana has ample room for two complete sets of stages, table areas and dance floors, in addition to well-tended grounds extending beyond the night club proper. Tall trees rising over the tables and through the roof in some spots lend the proper tropical atmosphere which blends well with the ultra-modern architecture of the night club. Shows include a chorus line of 50 and the dancers often perform on catwalks <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> Rhythms and costumes are colorfully native, with voodooism a frequent theme.

[...] By using roughly textured, earth-toned blocks, he sought to blend {{the house with the}} color and form of the trees and hillside. [...] While the design was in most ways a departure from Wright's prior work, it was consistent with his lifelong love of natural materials and his belief that buildings should complement their surroundings.

He continued the attack in this manner till prevented by darkness, killing many of the enemy, taking some of them prisoners, and finally driving them from the field. He then collected his own wounded, and securing them with many of the enemy's packs, he brought his prisoners and booty safe into camp. The next day the rest of the baggage was brought in, thus securing the entire baggage and ammunition of the French army. In this brilliant affair, Folsom lost only six men, but McGennis was mortally wounded, and died soon after. The loss of the French was very considerable".|$|E
