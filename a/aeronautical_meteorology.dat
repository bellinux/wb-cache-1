40|$|Today, modern {{computers}} {{are based on}} digital technology. However, during the decades after 1940, digital computers were complemented by the separate technology of analog computing. But what was analog computing, what were its merits, and who were its users? This thesis investigates the conceptual and technological history of analog computing. As a concept, analog computing represents the entwinement of a complex pre-history of meanings, including calculation, modelling, continuity and analogy. These themes are not only landmarks of analog's etymology, but also represent the blend of practices, ways of thinking, and social ties that together comprise an `analog culture'. The {{first half of this}} thesis identifies how the history of this technology can be understood in terms of the two parallel themes of calculation and modelling. Structuring the history around these themes demonstrates that technologies associated with modelling have less representation in the historiography. Basing the investigation around modelling applications, the thesis investigates the formation of analog culture. The second half of this thesis applies the themes of modelling and information generation to understand analog use in context. Through looking at examples of analog use in academic research, oil reservoir modelling, <b>aeronautical</b> design, and <b>meteorology,</b> the thesis explores why certain communities used analog and considers the relationship between analog and digital in these contexts. This study demonstrates that analog modelling is an example of information generation rather than information processing. Rather than focusing on the categories of analog and digital, it is argued that future historical scholarship in this field should give greater prominence to the more general theme of modelling.

40|$|The {{first half}} of the 20 th century was an era of {{weathering}} heights. As the development of powered flight made the free atmosphere militarily and economically relevant, meteorologists encountered new kinds of weather conditions at altitude. Pilots also learned to weather heights, as they struggled to survive in an atmosphere that revealed surprising dangers like squall lines, fog, icing, and turbulence. <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>meteorology</b> evolved out of these encounters, a heterogeneous body of knowledge that included guidelines for routing aircraft, networks for observing the upper air using scientific instruments, and procedures for synthesizing those observations into weather forecasts designed for pilots. As meteorologists worked to make the skies safe for aircraft, they remade their science around the physics of the free atmosphere. The dissertation tracks a small group of Scandinavian meteorologists, the “Bergen School,” who came to be the dominant force in world meteorology by forecasting for Arctic exploration flights, designing airline weather services, and training thousands of military weather officers during World War II. After the war, some of these military meteorologists invented the TV weather report (now the most widely consumed genre of popular science) by combining the narrative of the pre-fight weather briefing with the visual style of comic-illustrated training manuals. The dissertation argues that <b>aeronautical</b> <b>meteorology</b> is representative of what I call the “infrastructural sciences,” a set of organizationally intensive, purposefully invisible, applied sciences. These sciences enable the reliable operation of large technological systems by integrating theory-derived knowledge with routine environmental observation. The dissertation articulates a set of characteristics for identifying and understanding infrastructural science, and then argues that these culturally modest technical practices play a pervasive role in maintaining industrial lifeways. It concludes by noting that while meteorology successfully helped aviation become a reliable, taken-for-granted part of the transportation system, the interests of aviation created a meteorology that centered on the needs of pilots, to the detriment of fields like agricultural climatology. ...|$|E
40|$|The systematical {{problem of}} the {{cloudiness}} occurs in all the globe, being more intense in tropical and mountainous regions. In Brazil, especially in Alagoas, some areas exist where the cloudiness is constant and extreme during all the year, for which occurrence maps do not exist that they supply trustworthy information. The comment of clouds and {{the conditions of the}} sky allows the pilots, many times, to delineate the atmospheric conditions that go to find during the flights. The clouds are constituted basically by small water drops or ice crystals, depending on the height where if they develop.

40|$|Supercooled {{liquid water}} (SLW) in the {{atmosphere}} is responsible for aircraft icing which can cause severe accidents. To date, the microphysics scheme in {{the model of the}} Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) for the European scale (COSMO-EU; due to be replaced by ICON-EU in 2015) has been optimised to forecast precipitation on the ground but not the water phase {{in the atmosphere}}. As a consequence, prediction of SLW is rather poor, as was shown in a series of case studies by the <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Meteorology</b> department at DWD. ADWICE – the tool used by the DWD to predict aircraft icing – therefore does not rely on COSMO model SLW output, but predicts SLW by itself using a simple parcel method. In an effort to improve ADWICE it has been found that this algorithm has its limits and that it should be replaced by SLW prediction from a 3 D weather prediction model. To this end it is necessary to improve the SLW prediction in the COSMO model. In this paper we analyse the microphysics scheme of COSMO-EU with respect to SLW production and depletion and present modifications that greatly improve SLW prediction. As reference for two case studies we use radar-lidar-radiometer products from the Meteorological Observatory Lindenberg to verify the change in SLW prediction...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} April 2006, {{people who}} had {{previous}} contacts with the General Office for Meteorology (Ufficio Generale per la Meteorologia, or UGM) of Italy received a short note on the letterhead of Aerial Squadron Command-General Office for Meteorology of the Italian Air Force. The subject of this note, signed by Gen. Massimo Capaldo, {{the head of the}} UGM, was the constitution of a new General Office for Aerial Space and Meteorology (Ufficio Generale Spazio Aereo e Meteorologia, or USAM) starting on 1 May 2006. Gen. Capaldo did not explain the reason for the change. The note also stated that starting on the same day the UGM was terminated, the personnel of UGM transferred to the new office. The purpose of USAM is to support the Italian Air Force (Aeronautica Militare Italiana) chief of staff with technical direction and development of meteorological techniques. USAM also represents Italy in international organizations like the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The purpose of the new office was therefore very similar to the old UGM, but the personnel was significantly reduced to about one-third (from 70 to about 20 people), so the change seemed dictated at least in part by economic factors. Indeed, the operational meteorology branch, the National Center for <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Meteorology</b> and Climatology (Centro Nazionale di Meteorologia e Climatologia Aeronautica, or CNMCA), has remained as before, with more than 850 employees. Among the tasks of this center are the dissemination Marzanoof forecasts for the air force and for national civil protection and to safeguard life at sea. In analyzing the meaning of this change from UGM to USAM, we will try to give an overview of both current and possible future scenarios of meteorology in Italy...|$|E
40|$|Visibility {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parameters for meteorological observation and numerical weather prediction (NWP). It is also an important factor in everyday life, mainly for surface and air traffic especially in the <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Meteorology.</b> The visibility decides the taking off and landing of aircraft. If the airport visibility is lower than requirement for aircraft taking off stipulated by International Civil Aviation Administration, then the aircraft must be parked at the airport. So the accurate measurement of visibility is very important. Nowadays, many devices can be measured the visibility or meteorological optical range (MOR) such as Scatterometers, Transmissometers and visibility lidar. But there is not effective way to verify the accuracy of these devices expect the artificial visual method. We have developed a visibility testing system that can be calibration and verification these devices. The system consists of laser transmitter, optical chopper, phase-locking amplifier, the moving optic receiving system, signal detection and data acquisition system, atmospheric aerosol simulation chamber. All of them were placed in the atmosphere aerosol simulation chamber with uniform aerosol concentration. The Continuous wave laser, wavelength 550 nm, has been transmitted into the collimation system then the laser beam expanded into 40 mm diameter for compressing the laser divergence angle before modulated by optical chopper. The expanding beam transmitting in the atmosphere aerosol cabin received by the optic receiving system moving in the 50 m length precision guide with 100 mm optical aperture. The data of laser signal has been acquired by phase-locking amplifier every 5 meter range. So the 10 data points can be detected in the 50 meters guide once. The slope of the fitting curve can be obtained by linear fitting these data using the least square method. The laser extinction coefficient was calculated from the slope using the Koschmieder formula, then it been divided by 3 is MOR. The aerosol concentration in chamber can be changed by adjusting aerosol generator that producing variety of visibility atmospherical environment. The experiment has been carried out and the measurement accuracy of atmospheric transmittance is 0. 3 ‰ Corresponding to the accuracy of MOR 4. 9 % at the 2 km visibility environment. So this system can be calibrated and validated the other visibility measuring devices...|$|E
40|$|The EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on {{support to}} Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) was {{established}} by the EUMETSAT Council on 3 July 2005, starting activity on 1 September 2005. The Italian Meteorological Service serves as Leading Entity on behalf of twelve European member countries. H-SAF products include precipitation, soil moisture and snow parameters. Some products are based only on satellite observations while other products {{are based on the}} assimilation of satellite measurements/products into numerical models. In addition to products development and generation, H-SAF includes a product validation program and a hydrological validation program that are coordinated, respectively, by the Italian Department of Civil Protection and by the Polish Institute of Meteorology and Water Management. The National Center of <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Meteorology</b> and Climatology (CNMCA) of the Italian Air Force is responsible for operational product generation and dissemination. In this paper we describe the H-SAF precipitation algorithms and products, which have been developed by the Italian Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (in collaboration with the international community) and by CNMCA during the Development Phase (DP, 2005 - 2010) and the first Continuous Development and Operations Phase (CDOP- 1, 2010 - 2012). The precipitation products are based on passive microwave measurements obtained from radiometers onboard different sun-synchronous low-Earth-orbiting satellites (especially, the SSM/I and SMMIS radiometers onboard DMSP satellites and the AMSU-A - AMSU-B/MHS radiometer suites onboard EPS-MetOp and NOAA-POES satellites), as well as on combined infrared-passive microwave measurements in which the passive microwave precipitation estimates are used in conjunction with SEVIRI images from the geostationary MSG satellite. Moreover, the H-SAF product generation and dissemination chain and independent product validation activities are described. Also, the H-SAF program and its associated activities that currently are being carried out or are planned to be performed within the second CDOP phase (CDOP- 2, 2012 - 2017) are presented in some detail. Insofar as CDOP- 2, it is emphasized that all algorithms and processing schemes will be improved and enhanced so as to extend them to satellites that will be operational within this decade – particularly the geostationary Meteosat Third Generation satellites and the low-Earth-orbiting Core Observatory of the international Global Precipitation Measurement mission. Finally, the role of H-SAF within the international science and operations community is explained...|$|E
