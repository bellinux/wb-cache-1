5|$|The Glazers' {{shareholding}} increased {{gradually to}} 76.2% by 23 May, {{when they made}} their final offer of 300 pence per share, with a deadline of 3p.m. on 13 June. On 26 May, the Manchester United board wrote to the remaining shareholders indicating their intention to sell their own shares and advising the others to follow suit; in the same letter, chairman Sir Roy Gardner and non-executive directors Ian Much and Jim O'Neill offered their resignations. Despite the board's encouragement, the Glazers' share in the club had only reached 97.3% by 14 June, short of the 97.6% threshold required for a compulsory buyout of all remaining shareholders, prompting them to extend the deadline on their offer to purchase the remaining shares until 27 June. A statement released on 28 June said that Red Football's shareholding had reached 98% (259,950,194 shares), prompting <b>a</b> <b>squeeze</b> out of the remaining shareholders. The final valuation of the club was almost £790million (approximately $1.5billion at the exchange rate at the time).|$|E
5|$|The club {{went public}} in 1990 and {{was the subject of}} {{takeover}} bids from property trader Michael Knighton and Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB corporation before Malcolm Glazer's stake was announced in September 2003. By the end of the year, Glazer had increased his shareholding from 3.17% to around 15%, which he almost doubled in the year up to October 2004. His acquisition of John Magnier and J. P. McManus's 28.7% stake in May 2005 pushed his own up to around 57%, well over the 30% threshold that would force him to launch a takeover bid. A few days later, he took control of 75% of the club's shares, allowing him to delist the company from the stock exchange, and within a month, the Glazers took 98% ownership of the club via their Red Football parent company, forcing <b>a</b> <b>squeeze</b> out of the remaining 2%. The final purchase price of the club totalled almost £800million.|$|E

5|$|Several basic {{offensive}} tactics {{come into}} play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating {{a gap in the}} infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even {{at the expense of the}} batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as <b>a</b> <b>squeeze</b> play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.|$|E

25|$|Another type of punch, {{traditionally}} served {{before the}} departure of a hunting party in England, but now served {{at a variety of}} social events such as garden parties, cricket, tennis matches, and picnics, cups are generally lower in alcohol content than other punches and usually use wine, cider, sloe gin, or liqueurs as the base.

25|$|The cost of {{breathing}} gas containing a high fraction of helium {{is a significant}} part of the cost of deep diving operations, and can be reduced by recovering the breathing gas for recycling. A reclaim helmet is provided with a return line in the diver's umbilical, and exhaled gas is discharged to this hose through a reclaim regulator, which ensures that gas pressure in the helmet cannot fall below the ambient pressure. The gas is processed at the surface in the helium reclaim system by filtering, scrubbing and boosting into storage cylinders until needed. The oxygen content may be adjusted when appropriate. The same principle is used in built-in breathing systems used to vent oxygen-rich treatment gases from a hyperbaric chamber, though those gases are generally not reclaimed. A diverter valve is provided to allow the diver to manually switch to open circuit if the reclaim valve malfunctions, and an underpressure flood valve allows water to enter the helmet to avoid <b>a</b> <b>squeeze</b> if the reclaim valve fails suddenly, allowing the diver time to switch to open circuit without injury.|$|E
25|$|After his {{impressive}} rookie season, Vander Meer had {{a disappointing}} 1939 season, {{when he fell}} ill during spring training, and then suffered an injury when he slipped on a wet pitching mound in Pittsburgh. He posted a record of only five wins with nine losses and an earned run average of 4.67. Early in the 1940 season, he began to experience problems controlling the accuracy of his pitches. In June, the Reds released {{him back to the}} minor leagues where he played for the Indianapolis Indians and produced 6 wins against 4 losses. He returned to the major leagues in September and posted a 3-1 record, including a 12 inning victory against Philadelphia on September 18, that clinched the National League pennant for the Reds. In the 13th inning, Vander Meer hit a double, advanced to third base on a sacrifice fly, then scored the winning run on <b>a</b> <b>squeeze</b> bunt. In the 1940 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, Vander Meer made only one appearance when he entered Game 5 in the fifth inning with the Reds trailing by a score of 7-0. He pitched three scoreless innings as the Reds lost the game by a score of 8-0. The Reds {{went on to win the}} series in seven games.
