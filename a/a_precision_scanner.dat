40|$|In {{this work}} the digital {{photonic}} production of corundum components by a selective laser induced etching process (SLE) is investigated. Initially, {{the generation of}} 2 D corundum components using ultra short pulsed laser radiation and adjacent etching is investigated and optimized. Based on the generated knowledge {{the transfer of the}} process for the generation of 2 1 / 2 D and 3 D components is shown. In addition, <b>a</b> <b>precision</b> <b>scanner</b> with large numerical aperture (μScanner) is developed. The μScanner’s development leads to a decrease in irradiation time during the photonic production of corundum components. The development of the μScanner enables faster and flexible laser irradiation of customized components, driving prototype development and promoting affordable small series production.

40|$|The unique {{ability of}} the {{classical}} Josephson Voltage Standard (JVS) to generate and transfer high precision voltages up to 11 Vdc with uncertainties down to 5 ppb has created a growing market for those primary voltage standards throughout the metrological community. The goal of this project was to develop new hard- and software components in addition to commercially available equipment thus establishing a highly automated system which can be operated by well trained technicians. PREMA developed the PC-controlled JVS Control unit, including a current/voltage source biasing the Josephson array, a GUNN-supply for the microwave generation and <b>a</b> <b>precision</b> <b>scanner.</b> The WINDOWS based software allows complete system control via mouseclick together with data sampling, analysis and report. The 5 ppb uncertainty of a ZENER voltage reference calibration is documented. Commercializing this new PREMA JVS will help to further spread this technique of maintaining the SI volt throughout national metrology and industry laboratories worldwide. (orig.)

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{dissertation}} is the investigation of optical waveguides in crystals written with ultrashort laser pulses. The writing process of light guiding structures in Pr:YLiF 4 and Al 2 O 3 is analysed and optimized.

40|$|Robotically guided knee {{arthroplasty}} systems generally {{require an}} individualized, preoperative 3 D {{model of the}} knee joint. This is typically measured using Computed Tomography (CT) which provides the required accuracy for preoperative surgical intervention planning. Ultrasound imaging presents an attractive alternative to CT, allowing for reductions in cost {{and the elimination of}} doses of ionizing radiation, whilst maintaining the accuracy of the 3 D model reconstruction of the joint. Traditional phased array ultrasound imaging methods, however, are susceptible to poor resolution and signal to noise ratios (SNR). Alleviating these weaknesses by offering superior focusing power, synthetic aperture methods have been investigated extensively within ultrasonic non-destructive testing. Despite this, they have yet to be fully exploited in medical imaging. In this paper, the ability of a robotic deployed ultrasound imaging system based on synthetic aperture methods to accurately reconstruct bony surfaces is investigated. Employing the Total Focussing Method (TFM) and the Synthetic Aperture Focussing Technique (SAFT), two samples were imaged which were representative of the bones of the knee joint: a human-shaped, composite distal femur and a bovine distal femur. Data were captured using a 5 MHz, 128 element 1 D phased array, which was manipulated around the samples using a robotic positioning system. Three dimensional surface reconstructions were then produced and compared with reference models measured using <b>a</b> <b>precision</b> laser <b>scanner.</b> Mean errors of 0. 82 mm and 0. 88 mm were obtained for the composite and bovine samples, respectively, thus demonstrating the feasibility of the approach to deliver the sub-millimetre accuracy required for the application...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} system that enables a surgeon to acquire precise {{information}} about {{the shape of a}} bone part intraoperatively and without the use of 3 D imaging Using a navigation system, we track the position of the bone part and the position of a spatula with a known geometry. After initially creating a binary voxel-volume around the bone piece, we remove all voxel where the spatula was moved through. When the spatula is moved along the surface of the bone, we can iteratively create a model of the bone surface from the remaining voxels. This is done interactively with visual feedback to the user. We used three plastic bone replicas in order to access the system's accuracy. We compared the carved model with <b>a</b> high <b>precision</b> laser <b>scanner</b> model. The mean distance of 4. 2 Mio measured surface points was 0. 57 mm, standard deviation 0. 39 mm, the maximum distance was 3. 03 mm, 95 % of all measured points were closer than 1. 34 mm to the reference surface. We tested the applicability of the system during an intervention showing that the system can be used in clinical routine.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to provide {{practical}} guidelines {{for the design of}} welded joints of steel truss for encased composite steel–concrete beams. The results of experimental tests are presented and interpreted. The steel truss is made of a steel plate acting as the bottom chord, made of S 355 structural steel, coupled with steel rebars which form the upper chord, and steel inclined web rebars (V-reverse) welded to the two chord elements, both of them made of steel B 450 C. Butt welded joints of web bar to bottom steel plate and fillet welding joints of inclined web bars to top chord bars were tested, as they are different from the ones which are normally used due to the coupling of different steel types and complex geometry. For the prediction of strength of fillet welding joints, two analytical expressions are derived: the first is based on a local failure criterion and the second on a limit domain of the welding section. Comparison with experimental data proves the equivalence and reliability of the proposed indications. Guidelines for choosing the effective dimensions of the fillet weld able to ensure a required strength are provided. For validation of the suggested guidelines, <b>a</b> high <b>precision</b> digital <b>scanner</b> is used to determine the geometrical characteristics of the fillet weld...|$|R

40|$|Accurate 3 D data is of high {{importance}} for indoor modeling for various applications in construction, engineering and cultural heritage documentation. For {{the lack of}} GNSS signals hampers use of kinematic platforms indoors, TLS is currently the most accurate and precise method for collecting such a data. Due to its static single view point data collection, excessive time and data redundancy are needed for integrity and coverage of data. However, localization methods with affordable scanners are used for solving mobile platform pose problem. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate what level of trajectory accuracies can be achieved with high quality sensors and freely available state of the art planar SLAM algorithms, and how well this trajectory translates to a point cloud collected with a secondary scanner. In this study high <b>precision</b> laser <b>scanners</b> were used with a novel way to combine the strengths of two SLAM algorithms into functional method for precise localization. We collected five datasets using Slammer platform with two laser scanners, and processed them with altogether 20 different parameter sets. The results were validated against TLS reference.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{incidence of}} aircraft component failures as motivated a reassessment of the NDE methods applied to assure fleet airworthiness. In the past, eddy current testing {{has been limited}} {{by the presence of}} spurious signals, operator error and the lack of permanent test results. An eddy current system using portable <b>precision</b> <b>scanners</b> and signal analysis techniques developed in the nuclear industry has been applied to aircraft inspections. Using custom designed probes, multifrequency mixing, and digital signal processing, the detection criteria of 10 % loss of wall on the interior faying surface and cracks 60 mils (1. 5 mm) in length have been accomplished. The subtle nature of these flaw conditions and the presence of interfering signals prompted the need for signal processing techniques. To achieve this objective, real time signal processing that requires a minimum of computation has been implemented in an eddy current C-scan imaging system. The signal processing produces spatial displays of amplitude (in phase or quadrature), magnitude, phase of spatial derivatives of these parameters. Permanent images that are more easily interpretable for flaw detection are thus produced...|$|R
