5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of <b>a</b> <b>node,</b> (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to <b>a</b> <b>node</b> (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E

50|$|In a parse tree, each <b>node</b> {{is either}} <b>a</b> root <b>node,</b> <b>a</b> branch <b>node,</b> or <b>a</b> leaf <b>node.</b> In the above example, S is <b>a</b> root <b>node,</b> NP and VP are branch nodes, while John, ball, the, and hit are all leaf nodes.|$|R
50|$|The segment {{protection}} {{scheme is}} another way to protect multicast connections. A segment in a multicast tree is defined as the sequence of edges from the source or any splitting <b>node</b> (on <b>a</b> tree) to <b>a</b> leaf <b>node</b> or to <b>a</b> downstream splitting <b>node.</b> <b>A</b> destination <b>node</b> is always considered as <b>a</b> segment end <b>node</b> because it is either <b>a</b> leaf <b>node</b> in <b>a</b> tree or <b>a</b> splitting <b>node.</b>|$|R
5|$|The number 1 (expressed as a {{fraction}} 1/1) is {{placed at the}} root of the tree, and the location of any other number a/b can be found by computing gcd(a,b) using the original form of the Euclidean algorithm, in which each step replaces the larger of the two given numbers by its difference with the smaller number (not its remainder), stopping when two equal numbers are reached. A step of the Euclidean algorithm that replaces the first of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from <b>a</b> <b>node</b> to its right child, and a step that replaces the second of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from <b>a</b> <b>node</b> to its left child. The sequence of steps constructed in this way does not depend on whether a/b is given in lowest terms, and forms a path from the root to <b>a</b> <b>node</b> containing the number a/b. This fact can be used to prove that each positive rational number appears exactly once in this tree.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's orbit intersects {{with the}} {{ecliptic}} {{at the two}} nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, the new moon occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months (173.3 days) apart, known as eclipse seasons, and {{there will always be}} at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to <b>a</b> <b>node</b> during two consecutive months to eclipse the Sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses. This means that, in any given year, there will always be at least two solar eclipses, and there can be as many as five.|$|E
5|$|Cracks are linear {{openings}} {{that form}} in materials to relieve stress. When an elastic material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks meet at <b>a</b> <b>node.</b> Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form {{to relieve the}} stress. Further stress {{in the same direction}} would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.|$|E
30|$|In this trust {{measurement}} model, we need {{to compute}} service reliability, feedback effectiveness and recommendation credibility for one <b>node.</b> According to <b>a</b> <b>node’s</b> service reliability, the computational complexity is O(l), where l represents that this node has provided services for l nodes ever before. According to <b>a</b> <b>node’s</b> feedback effectiveness, the computational complexity is O(m), where m indicates that m nodes provided feedbacks for this <b>node.</b> According to <b>a</b> <b>node’s</b> recommendation credibility, the computational complexity is O(n), where n represents that n nodes were recommended by this node before. Therefore, the computational complexity of <b>a</b> <b>node’s</b> global trust is O(l+m+n). The proposed trust measurement model can be computed in polynomial time, thus it is computationally efficient.|$|R
30|$|There are {{two kinds}} of nodes in the entire OBC network, validating peer and non-validation peer.

Therefore, to {{evaluate}} the message sent by <b>a</b> variable <b>node</b> to <b>an</b> adjacent factor <b>node</b> along the connecting link, {{the product of the}} incoming messages along all of the other links is taken simply. In addition, <b>a</b> variable <b>node</b> can send <b>a</b> message to <b>a</b> factor <b>node</b> after it has received incoming messages from all other neighboring factor <b>nodes.</b> <b>A</b> message from <b>a</b> variable <b>node</b> to <b>a</b> factor <b>node</b> is the product of incoming messages and is illustrated in the middle and right parts of Figure 13.|$|R
5|$|The {{controller}} {{is central}} to the correct function of an Xgrid, as this node is responsible for the distribution, supervision and coordination of tasks on agents. The program running on the controller can assign and reassign tasks to handle individual agent failures on demand. The number of tasks assigned to an agent depend on two factors: the number of agents on an Xgrid and the number of processors in each node. The number of agents on an Xgrid determines how the controller will assign tasks. The tasks may be assigned simultaneously for a large number of agents, or queued for a small number of agents. When <b>a</b> <b>node</b> with more than one processor is detected on an Xgrid, the controller may assign one task per processor; this only occurs if the number of agents on the network is lower than the number of tasks the controller has to complete.|$|E
5|$|Ants of this genus are {{considered}} to be the most primitive within the family Formicidae. The body presents a wasp-like structure but with several ant-like characteristics. These ant-like characteristics, however, are primitive compared to more modern ants, and thus it is intermediate with other primitive ants and aculeate wasps. The presence of the metapleural gland, the nodiform (a structure resembling <b>a</b> <b>node,</b> which is a segment found between the mesosoma and gaster, the bulbous posterior portion of the metasoma), the structure of the petiole and its general physical appearance of an ant concludes Sphecomyrma species are ants rather than wasps; the absence of the metapleural gland would mean that it is most likely a wasp instead of an ant. It is not exactly known which group of wasps are the descendants of Sphecomyrma, but members of the family Tiphiidae, particularly those in the genus Methocha are strikingly similar with Sphecomyrma. Wilson placed the genus closest to the Tiphiidae among extant wasps, but a later study published in 1975 derives the ants from a later clade and not to the Tiphiidae.|$|E

The degree can be interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of <b>a</b> <b>node</b> for catching whatever is flowing through the network (such as a virus, or some information). In the case of a directed network (where ties have direction), we usually define two separate measures of degree centrality, namely indegree and outdegree. Accordingly, indegree is a count of the number of ties directed to the node and outdegree is the number of ties that the node directs to others. When ties are associated to some positive aspects such as friendship or collaboration, indegree is often interpreted as a form of popularity, and outdegree as gregariousness.|$|E
