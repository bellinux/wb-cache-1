5|$|During {{a reunion}} tour in summer 2008, The Kids in the Hall comedy troupe decided {{they would like}} to work {{together}} again. Since their 1996 movie Brain Candy, during which they had a falling out over creative differences, they had only worked together on live comedy tours and had not appeared on television together since the end of their show in 1995. Bruce McCulloch pitched a television story idea which {{the rest of the group}} liked. They spent <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>days</b> together brainstorming and developing characters. The storyline resolved into a murder mystery miniseries – partly inspired by the British comedy series The League of Gentlemen. McCulloch described it as Corner Gas meets Twin Peaks. The format diverged from their typical sketch comedy style by following a continuous narrative – though side-stories explore characters further. Along with producer Susan Cavin in fall 2008, they pitched the concept to CBC executive Fred Fuchs who greenlit the project.|$|E
25|$|On May 11, Brewers manager Ned Yost {{announced}} Gagné {{would be}} removed from the closer's role for a while, after 3 blown saves in 6 attempts. But after <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>days</b> Gagné said he was ready to go, and <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>days</b> later got his 10th save. However, Gagné continued to struggle as the team's closer and ultimately became the set-up man after losing his closer job to the veteran Salomón Torres. Gagné's struggles continued out of the bullpen, however. He eventually lost his set-up job to Guillermo Mota, and he finished the season as a middle relief pitcher, a role in which he still struggled.|$|E

25|$|In January 1941, the Soviet Union demanded {{control of}} the Petsamo mining area.

On 18 December 1940, Hitler officially approved Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. He expected both Finland and Romania to join the German campaign. Two days earlier, Finnish Major General Paavo Talvela had met German Colonel General Franz Halder and, <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>days</b> later, Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, in Berlin.

[...] Phelps passed him in the third 50-meter stretch, but Tarwater held off the rest of the field until the final 25 meters when both Bollier and Tyler Clary surged ahead, dropping Tarwater to fourth.

500|$|On November9, a {{cold front}} {{moved into the}} {{northwest}} Caribbean Sea, shortly before an abnormally strong high-pressure system entered in the area. The front then became nearly stationary and interacted with several tropical waves over the next week. The Intertropical Convergence Zone became active, causing monsoonal southwesterly flow to enter the system from the eastern Pacific Ocean. On November13, surface weather analysis indicated a weak low-pressure area had developed north of Colombia. Despite a well-defined low-level circulation, the system {{did not meet the}} criteria for a tropical cyclone because convective activity was not organized or concentrated within the vicinity of the center. Several small, weak centers of low pressure formed in the general area, and the entire system drifted northward for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>days.</b> In combination with a high-pressure area over the United States, the system produced gale-force winds on Florida, Cuba, the Bahamas and the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
