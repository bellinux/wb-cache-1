These contract exchanges have greatly benefited both their participants and the public at large, but participation was long limited to <b>a</b> wealthy <b>few.</b> <b>A</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago,</b> however, Internet websites, including Hotwire and Priceline, brought the power of contract exchanges directly to consumers, allowing regular people to flex their collective bargaining power to obtain low prices on travel services. Even more recently, other such 2 ̆ 2 consumer contract exchanges, 2 ̆ 2 including Prosper and MoneyAisle, have organized vibrant markets for small loans and certificates of deposit {{to the benefit of}} consumer borrowers and investors. Modern contract law usually bends over backwards to protect consumers, so one would surely expect it to be supportive of or at least not hostile to, these developments. Surprisingly, however, one strand of common law doctrine [...] the rules that pertain to so-called 2 ̆ 2 contracts of adhesion 2 ̆ 2 [...] actually stifles the development of consumer contract exchanges by undermining the reliable enforceability of the contracts they generate. Courts should therefore clarify that while exchange-traded consumer contracts fit the formal definition of contracts of adhesion, they should be enforced as if they were ordinary, negotiated agreements. This Article makes four novel contributions. First, it defines contract exchanges and enumerates their necessary institutional attributes. Second, it theorizes and recognizes a new form of contract exchange [...] the consumer contract exchange. Third, it suggests that the doctrine of adhesion hinders the further development of consumer contract exchanges. And fourth, it offers a common law solution to this common law problem...|$|R

With the importance of computing from the 80 ’s onwards, fixed telecommunication systems have been rapidly changing its emphasis from voice to data transfer (e. g. ISDN, ATM etc.). Historically, mobile telecommunication systems focused almost entirely on voice in both their design and structure. New areas, 3 rd generation mobile telecommunication systems undergoing standardisation are primarily focusing on high speed data over voice {{in an attempt to}} support users wish for mobile data access. At the beginning of the standardisation process, it was unknown if sufficient data services existed to justify the introduction of such a system. However, both the explosions in the internet activity and peoples love of mobility (e. g. mobile phones, PDA’s) has seemingly guaranteed the success of the 3 rd generation mobile concept. In essence, mobile systems have evolved from been primarily voice services based to voice and data, where data may be the primary service. The data services described for these new generation systems are primarily data transfer services, e. g. email, internet applications and web. In light of the evolutionary nature of telecommunications it would be unwise to conclude that n...|$|R
40|$|Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) {{has been}} the focus of much {{attention}} because it is used in large amounts and was reportedly relatively recalcitrant to bioreme-diation or natural attenuation. Beginning with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> papers <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago,</b> evidence has been presented that, in fact, under suitable conditions it is amenable to bioremediation. Many species from widely disparate microbial genera are able to consume it either as a sole carbon source or as a cometabolite. Optimal conditions differ from site to site. Both aerobic and anaerobic conditions may permit MTBE degradation, with a range of electron acceptors, from oxygen through Fe(III), Mn(IV), sulfate, nitrate, and methanogenesis. MTBE metabolism in the vadose zone can be highly active. The published literature suggests that natural populations are adapting to MTBE, and reported rates of biodegradation appear to be larger in the more recent literature. Plants may serve as efficient conduits to withdraw MTBE from the wet subsurface, releasing it to the atmosphere or the vadose zone, where it may be metabolized or diffuse into the atmosphere where it is quickly photodegraded. The major remaining issues are the time required to attain specified criteria of cleanup or whether augmentation is necessary for ef...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} features of rape historically {{was the fact that}} not all incidents of forced intercourse constituted this crime. An incident could be excluded from the definition of rape due to the relation between the parties, such as marriage (until <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> <b>ago</b> wives were nearly universally excluded, and in many countries they continue to be so) or due to the background of the victim (in many cultures forced sex on prostitute, slave, war enemy, member of a racial minority, etc., was not rape). For instance, in 17th century Scandinavia, Christian V's law of 1687 stipulated that rape could only be committed on three categories of women: somebody else's wife, a widow, or an honest virgin. Women who did not fit in any of these categories were not considered legal victims of the crime of rape.|$|E
40|$|Just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> short <b>decades</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>an</b> area {{explicitly}} called feminist psychology did {{not exist}} (Stewart & Dottolo, 2006). Psychol-ogy of women courses and the materials needed to teach them did not appear until the early 1970 s, and as Unger (2010) has shown, some of these earliest materials were not particularly feminist. Although today’s students may not realize it, even the increased presence {{of women in the}} discipline is a fairly recent phenomenon. In 1960, only 17. 5 % of all doctoral degrees in psychology in the United States were awarded to women. By the year 2004, the proportion of women receiving doctorates in the field had risen to 67. 4 % (Women’s Pro-grams Office, American Psychological Association, 2006). Female students are now the majority in most psychology classrooms in North America. However, despite this shift, in the increasingly antifeminist, neoliberal environment that surrounds us, the future of courses and programs on women and gender, especially feminist ones, is at risk. Given this context, it seems especially important to educate students about the short history, but long past, of women and feminism in psychology. Even though feminist psychology did not coalesce until the 1970 s, women (many of whom identified as feminists) have long been active and important contributors to psychology. Their voices and stories went largely undocumented until the 1970 s when feminist activism brought their contributions to light. Psychology’s Feminist Voices (www. fe ministvoices. com) is a unique multimedia digital archive that we have developed to highlight both the history and the current status of women and feminism in psychology. It is an advocacy tool for feminist psychology as well as an educational resource for instructors who want to include contextualized material about gender and feminism in their courses. Here, we give a brief history of the project and then present the teaching resources we have developed to help bring Psychology’s Feminist Voices into the classroom...|$|R

The rights {{of women and men}} to have equal pay and equal benefits for equal work were openly denied by the British Hong Kong Government up to the early 1970s. Leslie Wah-Leung Chung (鍾華亮, 1917–2009), President of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' Association 香港政府華員會 (1965–68), contributed to the establishment of equal pay for men and women, including the right for married women to be permanent employees. Before this, the job status of a woman changed from permanent employee to temporary employee once she was married, thus losing the pension benefit. Some of them even lost their jobs. Since nurses were mostly women, this improvement of the rights of married women meant much to the nursing profession. In some European countries, married women could not work without the consent of their husbands until <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> <b>ago,</b> for example in France until 1965 and in Spain until 1975.

[...] The Grosser Aletsch Glacier is the largest glacier in Switzerland and has been studied since the late 19th century. Aletsch Glacier retreated [...] from 1880 to 2009. This rate of retreat has also increased since 1980, with 30%, or , of the total retreat occurring in the last 20% of the time period. The Morteratsch Glacier in Switzerland has had one of the longest periods of scientific study with yearly measurements of the glacier's length commencing in 1878. The overall retreat from 1878 to 1998 has been [...] with a mean annual retreat rate of approximately [...] per year. This long-term average was markedly surpassed in recent years with the glacier receding [...] per year during the period between 1999–2005. Similarly, of the glaciers in the Italian Alps, only about a third were in retreat in 1980, while by 1999, 89% of these glaciers were retreating. In 2005, the Italian Glacier Commission found that 123 glaciers in Lombardy were retreating. A random study of the Sforzellina Glacier in the Italian Alps indicated that the rate of retreat from 2002 to 2006 was much higher than in the preceding 35years. To study glaciers located in the alpine regions of Lombardy, researchers compared a series of aerial and ground images taken from the 1950s through the early 21st century and deduced that between the years 1954-2003 the mostly smaller glaciers found there lost more than half of their area. Repeat photography of glaciers in the Alps indicates that there as been significant retreat since studies commenced.|$|E
