5|$|Although Du Bois {{attended}} <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Congregational {{church as}} a child, he abandoned organized religion while at Fisk College. As an adult, Du Bois described himself as agnostic or a freethinker, {{but at least one}} biographer concluded that Du Bois was virtually an atheist.Lewis, p. 550 (agnostic, atheist).Johnson, passim (agnostic). However, another analyst of Du Bois's writings concluded that he had a religious voice, albeit radically different from other African-American religious voices of his era, and inaugurated a 20th-century spirituality to which Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, and James Baldwin also belong.|$|E
5|$|In {{taking control}} of the studio, General Tire {{restored}} RKO's links to broadcasting. General Tire had bought the Yankee Network, <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> regional radio network, in 1943. In 1950, it purchased the West Coast regional Don Lee Broadcasting System, and two years later, the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, owner of the WOR TV and radio stations in New York City. The latter acquisition gave General Tire majority control of the Mutual Broadcasting System, one of America's leading radio networks. General Tire then merged its broadcasting interests into a new division, General Teleradio.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{returns to}} his {{teaching}} position at <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> college, where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents. They inform him that the Nazis are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the University of Chicago. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant – the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark, their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra {{is the key to}} finding the Well of Souls, a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried.|$|E

5|$|Mount Washington {{has been}} the subject of several famous paintings, part of <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> school of art known as White Mountain art. Inspired by the Hudson River School of {{landscape}} painting, a number of artists during the Victorian era ventured into the White Mountains in search of natural subjects. Train service in the area spurred increased tourism and the construction of the Glen House where Albert Bierstadt and his photographer brother (Bierstadt Brothers) stayed. John P. Soule, John B. Heywood and the Kilburn Brothers also produced stereographic images of scenery in the area.|$|E
5|$|On April 14, 1775, Gage {{received}} {{instructions from}} Secretary of State William Legge, Earl of Dartmouth, to disarm the rebels and to imprison the rebellion's leaders, but Dartmouth gave Gage considerable discretion in his commands. Gage's decision to act promptly {{may have been}} influenced by information he received on April 15, from a spy within the Provincial Congress, telling him that although the Congress was still divided on the need for armed resistance, delegates were being sent to the other New England colonies to see if they would cooperate in raising <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> army of 18,000 colonial soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Welsh Quakers, Baptists and Methodists {{settled in}} the Welsh Tract of Pennsylvania. While some Welsh colonists like Roger Williams, left to found Rhode Island, Anne Hutchinson founded a seed {{settlement}} in New York. Rhode Island was not initially counted as part of New England, having been excluded from the New England Confederation, but later joined the Dominion of New England. Thus, {{the definition of the}} Middle Colonies sometimes changed and overlapped with Rhode Island's colonial boundaries. After joining the Dominion of New England, however, Rhode Island was permanently thought of as <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> colony. New York's initial possession of parts of Maine ensured a close relationship with other New England colonies like Vermont and a continuing New England influence in the colony.|$|E

5|$|On 14 October 2005, Knox {{appeared}} at <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Championship Wrestling (NECW) event in Framingham, Massachusetts, where she competed in a four-way match that was won by Violet Flame. Later that month, Knox participated in All Pro Wrestling (APW)'s third ChickFight tournament in Hayward, California, {{in which she}} defeated Morgan {{in the first round}} on 28 October, but lost to eventual winner Mariko Yoshida in the second round later that night. The following night, she teamed with Cheerleader Melissa and Tiffany in a losing effort to Rain, Morgan and Hailey Hatred in a six-woman tag team match at an APW show. She also appeared for the AWA Pinnacle promotion on 21 January and 26 February 2006, with the first being when she acted as the referee in a match between Caden Matthews and Christopher Ryseck, helping Ryseck to win by hitting Matthews with a chair. On 26 February, she and Ryseck were defeated by Matthews in a handicap match in Pacific, Washington.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September 1932, Holden was {{travelling}} as {{a passenger}} aboard <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Airways DH.80 Puss Moth from Sydney to Brisbane when it crashed at Byron Bay in northern New South Wales, killing him instantly. The other occupants, pilot Ralph Virtue {{and the joint}} owner of the Canberra, Holden's schoolfriend Dr George Hamilton, also perished. Investigations determined that the Puss Moth, VH-UPM, had gone down {{as a result of}} wing failure caused by aileron flutter. A crowded memorial service for Holden and Hamilton took place at Sydney Church of England Grammar School on 20 September; they were cremated that afternoon at Rookwood Cemetery, where eighteen aircraft piloted by friends and associates of the pair overflew the chapel. Holden was survived by his wife and children. His father Hubert carried on operating Holden's Air Transport Services, floating it as a public corporation and serving as chairman. Les Holden, George Hamilton, and one of their schoolmates who had also recently died, Henry Braddon, were commemorated with a memorial stained-glass window at the Sydney Church of England Grammar School chapel in 1934. Holden was also honoured by Holden Street, built in the Sydney suburb of Maroubra in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Stone called <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> Woman’s Rights Convention in Boston on June 2, 1854, {{to expand}} her petitioning efforts. The {{convention}} adopted her resolution for petitioning all six New England legislatures, {{as well as}} her proposed form of petition, and it appointed a committee in each state to organize the work. In a speech before the second New England Woman’s Rights Convention, held in June, 1855, Stone urged that one reason women needed suffrage was to protect any gains achieved, reminding them that “the next Legislature may undo all that the last have done for women.” The convention adopted a resolution calling the ballot “woman’s sword and shield; the means of achieving and protecting all other civil rights” and another urging the national convention to make suffrage petitioning its priority.|$|E

5|$|The Jets {{began the}} 2002 season 1–4, but then put {{together}} a six-game winning streak. On {{the final day of}} the season, the Jets beat the Packers following <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> victory over Miami. This gave the Jets a 9–7 record, their second post-merger division title, and a playoff berth. Chad Pennington had an outstanding day against the Packers and finished the season the top-rated passer in the league. The Jets began the playoffs against the Indianapolis Colts at home, and defeated them 41–0. The Jets then played the Raiders, who again defeated them in Oakland, 30–10. The Jets lost a number of key players to free agency in the offseason. Four signed with the Washington Redskins, including kicker Hall, wide receiver Laveranues Coles, kick returner Chad Morton, and offensive lineman Randy Thomas. During a preseason game against the Giants, Pennington sustained a serious wrist injury, and required surgery. The aging Testaverde stepped in as starter, but led the Jets to only a 2–6 record, including losses to the Redskins and the Dallas Cowboys. The Jets split their remaining games and finished 6–10.|$|E
5|$|The ice trade {{began in}} 1806 {{as the result}} of the efforts of Frederic Tudor, <b>a</b> <b>New</b> <b>England</b> entrepreneur, to export ice on a {{commercial}} basis. In New England, ice was an expensive product, consumed only by the wealthy who could afford their own ice houses. Nonetheless, icehouses were relatively common amongst the wealthier members of society by 1800, filled with ice cut, or harvested, from the frozen surface of ponds and streams on their local estates during the winter months. Around the neighbouring New York City area, the hot summers and rapidly growing economy had begun to increase local demand for ice towards the end of the 18th century, creating a small-scale market amongst farmers who sold ice from their ponds and streams to local city institutions and families. Some ships occasionally transported ice from New York and Philadelphia for sale to the southern U.S. states, in particular Charleston in South Carolina, laying it down as ballast on the trip.|$|E
