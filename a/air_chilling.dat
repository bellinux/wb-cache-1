40|$|The {{scope of}} the current {{experiments}} was to superchill a selection of fresh food by two superchilling methods followed by extensive storage studies and monitoring of quality during superchilled storage. Several methods for superchilling have been implemented at fish processing sites, but to a very limited extent and not adjusted to automated production lines. The current study presents measurements of the efficiency and precision of two methods for superchilling (liquid CO 2 injection and <b>air</b> <b>chilling)</b> {{as well as their}} applicability for the expected development towards automated production lines in fresh food manufacturing. Secondly, as a precision index, the effect of the amount of ice caused by superchilling was investigated with respect to prolonged shelf-life and end product quality.

Analyses of drip loss, liquid loss and microbiological quality during storage showed that superchilling improved the shelf life of salmon and chicken fillets significantly- being an important contribution to food safety of fresh food. However, within the tested boundaries for ice fraction, the level of ice stored inside the fillets did not seem to considerably influence on the physical and microbiological quality of the products. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Air blast {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{employed}} industrial chilling methods. It can be enhanced, i. e., increasing heat transfer and reducing cooling time, by superficial evaporative phenomena. This work reports a methodology, including experimental setup and mathematical modelling, to quantify the <b>air</b> <b>chilling</b> enhancement by wetting the surface of the object to be chilled. A spherical metal model was covered by a cotton tissue (wet or dry) and placed into a cold chamber. The effective heat transfer coefficient was determined at different temperature, air velocity, and relative humidity from time-temperature profiles into the sphere. Under the same air conditions, the effective coefficient between sphere and air was increased three-fold by moistening the cotton tissue on the sphere surface. Furthermore, comparing a dry and wet surface showed that evaporative cooling resulted in much shorter chilling times. The proposed approach was able to assess evaporative heat transfer by measuring only the time-temperature profile, and is suitable for industrial applications...|$|E

This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of postmortem electrical stimulation (ES) on tenderness, absorbance ratio (r-value), pH, and drip loss of breast fillets following <b>air</b> <b>chilling.</b> In each of four replications, eight birds were electrically stimulated and twelve birds were used as controls. The ES birds were stimulated at the head in a l% saline bath(45 OV,. 45 A, 2 son/lsofffor 7 pulses). After evisceration the carcasses were air chilled in a cooler at 1 - 20 C with an average relative humidity of 9 1 % and an air speed of 43. 9 m 3 /minute. Pre-chill and post-chill carcass weights were measured to determine drip loss. Breast fillets were harvested at 2 and 4 h postmortem from both ES and control carcasses and also at 8 h postmortem from control carcasses. Fillets were aged on ice while the fillet tips were excised and frozen for later measurement of pH and r-value. Although there was no significant ES effect on shear value at 2 h postmortem, the ES fillets had a significantly (P< 0. 05) lower shear value mean than the control fillets at 4 h postmortem. There {{was no significant difference between}} the shear value means of the ES 4 h fillets and the control 8 h fillets. ES accelerated the normal postmortem decline in pH at both 2 and 4 h postmortem. The r-value means for the control and ES samples were similar at 2 h postmortem, but the r-value mean of the ES samples was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than the control at 4 h postmortem.

Two plants of commercial beef slaughterhouse located in Goiânia and fiscalized by the Federal Inspection Service were used to develop the research. The spray-chilling treatment was accomplished in an intermittent way, commanded by a controlled logical program, with cycles of 90 seconds, in intervals of 30 minutes, during the first 4 hours of the chilling process. Physico-chemical and bacteriological analysis were made in spray-chilled water and carcasses samples, according to recommendation of the effective legislation. The average values of carcasses weight loss of treatment group were lower to the ones verified for the control group, in both plants, A and B, (P < 0, 001), showing a high economic potential. As a conclusion of physico-chemical and bacteriological analysis results of water and meat samples, it is clear that the technology of chilling beef carcasses in the conventional system associated to spraying did not interfere in the quality of meat, and it can become an analysis object on part of official organs for sanitary regulation and fiscalization, for its definitive adoption...|$|E
40|$|The {{decontamination}} {{of poultry}} carcasses is gaining {{increased interest in}} Europe, especially because poultry is implicated as a risk factor in human campylobacteriosis. Thus we appraised the antibacterial activity of interventions applied on poultry carcasses. Physical interventions included water-based treatments, irradiation, ultrasound, <b>air</b> <b>chilling,</b> or freezing. Especially hot water, steam, electrolyzed water (EW), and irradiation effectively reduced the bacterial load. Reductions obtained by hot water, steam, and EW mainly ranged from 0. 9 to 2. 1, 2. 3 to 3. 8, and 1. 1 to 2. 3 orders of magnitude, respectively. However, hot water or steam might exert an adverse impact on the carcass appearance. Chemical interventions primarily comprised organic acids, chlorine-based treatments, or phosphate-based treatments. Thereby, acetic and lactic acid, acidified sodium chlorite, and trisodium phosphate mainly yielded reductions {{in the range from}} 1. 0 to 2. 2 orders of magnitude. Besides, some combination treatments further enhanced the reductions. However, organic matter often reduces the antimicrobial activity of chemicals. Furthermore, biological interventions (e. g. bacteriophages) constitute promising alternatives, but further investigations are required. Although the mentioned interventions reduced the bacterial loads on poultry carcasses to some extent, decontamination treatments always must be considered part of an integral food safety system...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of a dry-AC method on shear force and water-holding capacity (WHC) of broiler breast meat deboned 4 h postmortem compared to hot-boned (no chill) or immersion-chilled meat. Ready-to-cook broiler carcasses were hot-boned, chilled by ice water immersion (0. 3 °C, 50 min) or chilled by cross-flow cold, dry air (0. 7 °C, 150 min). Pectoralis (p.) major and p. minor were removed from the bone at 4 h postmortem. Shear force was measured using a Warner-Bratzler (WB) method and WHC was estimated using cooking yield, drip loss, amount of bound water (filter paper method) and water uptake (swell/centrifugation method). Regardless of muscle type, the WB shear force value of AC samples was significantly lower than that of hot-boned samples; however, there was no difference in the shear force between AC and IC. Regardless of measurement methods, there were no differences (P > 0. 05) in WHC between the three treatments. These results demonstrate that when compared to no chill, AC followed by 4 h postmortem deboning can lead to a difference in WB shear values while WHC properties can be retained. For broiler breast meat deboned 4 h postmortem, AC does not result in any significant differences in shear force and WHC when compared to IC...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of chilling method on broiler carcass skin color, moisture retention, breast fillet quality, and functionality. One hundred fifty eviscerated broiler carcasses were removed from a commercial processing line before chilling, transported to the laboratory, weighed, and chilled by dry air or immersion in ice water. Postchill carcasses were weighed for moisture uptake or loss and held on ice at 4 °C for 24 h. Carcass skin color was measured immediately after chilling and after storage. After storage, fillets were deboned, marinated, and cooked. Fillet color was measured on the medial surface before marination and after cooking. Cooked fillet shear values were determined using an Allo-Kramer multiple blade. After 150 min of <b>air</b> <b>chilling,</b> carcasses lost 2. 5 % of prechill weight, and weight loss ranged from 2. 2 to 3. 5 %. Moisture uptake during immersion averaged 9. 3 % of the prechill weight but varied widely with a range of 3. 4 to 14. 7 %. Immediately after chilling, breast skin for immersion-chilled carcasses was significantly lighter (higher L*), less red (lower a*), and less yellow (lower b*) than the breast skin color for air-chilled carcasses. Storage time improved appearance (lighter skin color) of air-chilled carcasses. Raw and cooked fillet color, fillet marination pickup, and cooked fillet tenderness were not affected by chilling method.

A finite element scheme, using 1, 600 linear triangular elements with 861 nodes, was implemented in Matlab 6. 5 to solve the model. The model considered a variable initial temperature distribution and combined convective, radiative, and evaporative boundary conditions. Predicted values agreed well with experimental data collected in actual processing conditions. Validation of model performance resulted in maximum deviations of 2. 54 °C and 0. 29 % for temperature and weight loss histories, respectively. The maximum temperature deviation (2. 54 °C) occurred at the surface; however, for center temperature, the maximum deviation was lower (1. 59 °C). The validated model {{was used to assess}} the extent of deviations from stabilization performance standards established by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) caused by unexpected equipment failure or electrical power outage. A total of 48 simulations were also carried out to establish critical product sizes and operating conditions for compliance with FSIS performance standards. It was concluded that, for cured meat products, small processors should be able to meet the stabilization requirements for any typical commercially available product size, under all simulated chilling conditions. Conversely, for non−cured meats, products should have a maximum weight of 2. 25 kg (with typical dimensions of: major axis = 21. 2 cm, minor axis = 13. 9 cm) in order to comply with FSIS standards, particularly to meet the criteria of cooling between 54. 4 °C to 26. 6 °C.

40|$|Meat {{carcasses}} must be chilled {{to below}} 7 °C {{before leaving the}} slaughterhouse. Typically this is done by passing cold air over the surfaces of eviscerated and de-hided carcasses. This surface cooling can take many hours to reduce centre temperatures to below 7 °C. In vascular perfusion chilling (VPC), a cold fluid is circulated through the intact vascular system, offering significant reductions in cooling time. This paper describes a small feasibility study to evaluate vascular perfusion techniques for rapid chilling of lamb carcasses using a proprietary Flo-ice(™) system. This produces pumpable ice slurries containing very fine ice particles, suitable for circulating through vascular systems. VPC {{was found to be}} capable of rapid initial reduction of carcass temperatures in comparison with <b>air</b> <b>chilling</b> (mean times to 20 °C in deep legs were reduced from 2. 6 to 1. 3 h, which was significantly different at P< 0. 05). In all cases however, uptake of perfusate into the carcasses occurred. This limited the duration of the perfusion treatment and as a result restricted the period of enhanced cooling. Samples from carcasses treated with VPC were lighter (P< 0. 05, with mean measured L value increasing from 43. 4 to 46. 8) and more yellow (P< 0. 05, with mean measured b value increasing from 6. 7 to 7. 9) than samples from conventionally chilled carcasses, and had lower shear force values when cooked (P< 0. 05, with mean force reducing from 10. 0 to 6. 8 kg). This was most probably due to the added water in the meat. Microbial quality of the meat was not significantly affected by the perfusion treatments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ultrasound is a {{relatively}} new method that has been used in the food industry for enhancing unit operations such as drying, extraction and freezing. Sonication, despite a small invasiveness, has an effect on various physical, chemical and biochemical changes in the treated materials. Freezing is a widely used process in the food industry for extending the shelf-life of the products due to decreasing the food temperature. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate a 30 -minute ultrasound treatment on the freezing process of carrot juices (9, 12 and 21 °Bx) from two producers. Freezing was conducted by immersion and <b>air</b> <b>chilling</b> method at- 30 °C medium temperature. The study examined how ultrasound effects the ex-tract, density of juices, the specific freezing time, freezing point, Moreover, the freezing curves were evaluated. It was observed that 30 -minute ultrasonic treatment did not affect physical properties of tested juices, only in the case of higher concentrated juices, the in-crease of tested parameters was seen. There was no difference in the shape of freezing curves, regardless of the freezing method, concentration of the juice and its producer and the applica-tion of sonication either. Regardless the concentration or the US pre-treatment, it has been observed that the specific time required to freeze the product in the immersion method was shorter than in the shock freezing. Along with the increase of concentrations of carrot juice the freezing point decreased, regardless of the producer. The freezing point of carrot juices, after the application of the US, slightly decreased. Research in this study confirms the reports of the reduced freezing time after the application of ultrasound in case of carrot juices...|$|E
40|$|James et al. (2006) have {{reviewed}} {{previous studies}} {{related to the}} chilling of fresh products. The goal of chilling is always to limit the growth of pathogenic and food spoilage microorganisms. It has been proved that chilling reduces the number of both types of microorganisms {{on the surface of}} fresh products. In Europe dry air is the preferred chilling method. This method is believed to have clear microbiological advantages but James et al. (2006) show that the published data do not support this belief and direct contact chilling methods might even have larger microbiological advantages. However, in a continuous production line, chlorination or other additive is needed to prevent accumulation of micro-organisms. This is not acceptable in Europe. The rate of chilling has some influence on the taste, texture and appearance of the fresh product. Very rapid chilling will generally lead to robust structure while very slow chilling can produce soft texture. Pederson (1979) has compared the costs of different chilling methods in Denmark. When only energy costs were considered, the cost of a countercurrent water immersion chilling system was one fifth that of an <b>air</b> <b>chilling</b> method. Slush ice is often preferred in immersion systems since cooling takes place without freezing damage of the product while the heat removal takes place at a low temperature. For 70 % slush ice content of the slurry, the cooling time is lowest while with 35 % slush ice the highest weight gain is attained (around 5 %). When air is used, short chilling times require low air temperatures and high air velocities. James et al. (2006) report for a specific product a chilling time (38 to 4 oC) 150 minutes with 0. 75 m/s and 1 oC, 60 minutes with 4. 1 m/s and - 7 oC, and 17 minutes with - 40 oC. Short chilling times impose low air temperatures and so low evaporating temperatures and high energy consumption of the primary refrigeration cycle. In this paper the immersion of fresh products in melting carbon dioxide hydrate crystals, produced at + 8 oC and 30 bar, is proposed for rapid chilling of fresh products. First the chilling time of a specific fresh product from 30 to 4 oC making use of a â€œshock freezer (2 m/s air velocity, air at - 10 oC) and applying a slurry of CO 2 hydrate crystals is compared. Also the effect of these two methods on the weight loss of the product is compared. Then the chilling of chicken products making use of the proposed method is experimentally verified. Also the microbiologic contamination of samples chilled using high speed dry air, immersion in melting water and immersion in CO 2 hydrate slurry are compared. Finally the economic advantages and practical applicability of the proposed method are evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Foods of bovine origin {{have been}} implicated as the {{principle}} vehicle in disease outbreaks of pathogenic Escherichia coli, hence the increasing interest {{in understanding the}} behaviour of this pathogen on carcasses during processing and handling. In the absence of rapid and noninvasive methods to determine the microbiological safety of meat carcasses, predictive modelling has been suggested as a strategy to estimate the consequences of processing and handling procedures on the fate and numbers of microorganisms. This thesis reports two contributions in realising the potential of predictive modelling {{for use in the}} food industry: development and extensive validation of a growth model for E. coli and advances in characterisation of bacterial lag phase duration. A modified square-root model for predicting E. coli growth was developed and its reliability assessed against a variety of data. The bias and accuracy factors formed the basis of the model evaluations and provided an objective summary of model performance. The model performed well when compared to data generated in liquid growth media, ground beef and for data collated from the literature. The model performed as well as, or better than other published models for E. co/i growth. In particular, the model predicted growth in meat and meat products better than other models. Evaluation of predictive models in industry is considered the most rigorous test of model performance. The deliberate introduction of potential pathogens in abattoirs is precluded in Australia, thus the E. co/i growth model could not be validated by trials on carcasses during normal commercial processing. Instead, a predictive growth model for a surrogate organism, Klebsiella oxytoca, was developed and evaluated against data for the growth of K. oxytoca on carcasses during normal chilling operations. Those studies suggest that predictive modelling can be used to predict the average changes in numbers of bacteria on a carcass resulting from temperature and water activity changes caused by <b>air</b> <b>chilling</b> processes. Lag times have long been considered an uncontrollable variable in food microbiology. Studies were undertaken to describe the effects of environment and physiological history of the cell on lag times. Abrupt temperature, pH and osmotic shifts of cultures were found to induce lag phases in a variety of foodborne bacteria, highlighting the prospect of inducing lags by manipulating the rate and extent of change of environmental conditions. Variability in bacterial lag times was reduced by using the concept of relative lag times or "generation time equivalents", i. e. the ratio of lag time to generation time (RLT). The physiological history of the cell, including growth phase and habituation, affect the magnitude of the RLT response. In general, environmental downshifts induce larger RLTs than equivalent upshifts. These observations support the hypothesis that lag time can be understood in terms of the amount {{of work to be done}} to adjust to new environmental conditions and the rate at which that work is done. The results in this thesis demonstrate that careful interpretation of RLT responses under very stressful environmental conditions is required due to potential changes in growth curve shapes. Additionally a normal physiological range for water activity is proposed. Characterisation of bacterial lag times using RLT simplifies their inclusion in growth predictions, thus increasing the utility of predictive models. Results in this thesis support those of Ross (1999) who observed a common pattern of distribution of relative lag times for a wide range of species across a wide range of conditions in the range of 4 to 6 generation time equivalents...|$|E
