5|$|Bell {{explained}} that he, Jed Whedon, and Tancharoen supervise {{all of the}} series' creative decisions, often consulting with Loeb. When the showrunners <b>are</b> <b>writing</b> the series, one person can write a script while the other two break stories, so that a story can be broken every few weeks. If the executive producers sign off on a story, {{a member of the}} series' writers room then produces an outline, gets notes on it from the showrunners, writes a full script, gets notes on it from ABC and the production crew, and then goes to set to produce the episode.|$|E
5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they <b>are</b> <b>writing.</b> The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E

25|$|In {{the letter}} Gates {{mentions}} they <b>are</b> <b>writing</b> APL for the 8080 and 6800 microprocessors. The APL programming language was in vogue with some computer {{scientists in the}} 1970s. The language uses a character set based on the Greek alphabet that required special terminals. Most hobbyist terminals did not display lower case letters much less Greek symbols. Gates was enamored with APL but Allen did not think they could sell this product. Interest in the APL project faded and the software was never completed.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of whether such symbols <b>are</b> <b>writing,</b> primitive or proto-writing, or merely non-writing symbols or signs for other purposes such as identification is a highly controversial one, and the debate still continues today. Proponents of the view that they are early Chinese writing tend to see evidence in comparisons of individual signs with individual oracle bone script characters. Others believe that Neolithic signs {{are part of an}} incipient semiotic system that eventually {{led to the development of}} mature Chinese writing.|$|E

25|$|HD DVD-RW is the rewritable disc {{variant of}} HD DVD with equal storage {{capacity}} to an HD DVD-R. The primary advantage of HD DVD-RW over HD DVD-R {{is the ability}} to erase and rewrite to an HD DVD-RW disc, up to about 1,000 times before needing replacement, making them comparable with the CD-RW and DVD-RW standards. This is also of benefit if there <b>are</b> <b>writing</b> errors when recording data, as the disc is not ruined and can still store data by erasing the faulty data.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly, {{writing is}} a {{critical}} part of learning in English Language Arts and all content areas, and the ability to write effectively is a requirement for success at all levels of education, from elementary school through high school and in university and adult education classes. Studies of dialogue journal writing have shown that students (and the teachers, classroom helpers, or prospective teachers they <b>are</b> <b>writing</b> with) increase their sense of engagement with each other, learn to express themselves for an audience, and experience an atmosphere of openness and expression. Students also develop writing fluency over time.|$|E
25|$|Chinese bronze inscriptions, also {{commonly}} referred to as Bronze script or Bronzeware script, <b>are</b> <b>writing</b> in a variety of Chinese scripts on Chinese ritual bronzes such as zhōng bells and dǐng tripodal cauldrons from the Shang dynasty to the Zhou dynasty and even later. Early bronze inscriptions were almost always cast (that is, the writing was done with a stylus in the wet clay of the piece-mold from which the bronze was then cast), while later inscriptions were often engraved after the bronze was cast. The bronze inscriptions are one of the earliest scripts in the Chinese family of scripts, preceded by the oracle bone script.|$|E

25|$|The Chinese {{family of}} scripts <b>are</b> <b>writing</b> systems {{descended from the}} Chinese Oracle Bone Script and used {{for a variety of}} {{languages}} in East Asia. They include logosyllabic systems such as the Chinese script itself (or hanzi, now in two forms, traditional and simplified), and adaptations to other languages, such as Kanji (Japanese), Hanja (Korean), Chữ nôm (Vietnamese) and sawndip (Zhuang). More divergent are Tangut, Khitan large script, and its offspring Jurchen, as well as Yi script and possibly Korean Hangul, which were inspired by Chinese although not directly descended from it. The partially deciphered Khitan small script may be another. In addition, various phonetic scripts descend from Chinese characters, of which the best known are the various kana syllabaries, the zhuyin semi-syllabary, nüshu, and some influence on hangul.|$|E
25|$|The meaning (if any) of {{the symbols}} is unknown, and their nature {{has been the}} subject of much debate. Scholars who {{conclude}} that the inscribed symbols <b>are</b> <b>writing</b> base their assessment on a few assumptions which are not universally endorsed. First, the existence of similar signs on other artifacts of the Danube civilization suggest that there was an inventory of standard shapes used by scribes. Second, the symbols are highly standardized and have a rectilinear shape comparable to that manifested by archaic writing systems. Third, the information communicated by each character was specific, with an unequivocal meaning. Finally, the inscriptions are sequenced in rows, whether horizontal, vertical or circular. If they do comprise a script, it is not known what kind of writing system they represent. Some archaeologists who support the idea that they do represent writing, notably Marija Gimbutas, have proposed that they are fragments of a system dubbed the Old European Script.|$|E

500|$|On the contrary, one of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of his philosophical outlook was an unwavering insistence on a series of points that may seem obvious but which are nevertheless all-too-frequently neglected: that moral or ethical thought is part of human life; that in writing about it, philosophers <b>are</b> <b>writing</b> about something of genuine importance; that {{it is not easy to}} say anything worth saying about the subject; that what moral philosophers write is answerable to the realities of human history, psychology, and social affairs; and that mere cleverness is indeed not the relevant measure of value." ...|$|E
