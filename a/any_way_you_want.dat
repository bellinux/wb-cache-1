2500|$|There {{was great}} public {{demand for a}} Beatles reunion during the 1970s. For example, in September 1976, American {{promoter}} Sid Bernstein, who had booked many of the Beatles' historic American appearances in 1964-1966, published a full-page ad in the New York Times publicly requesting the group to reunite and offering millions of dollars. On April 24, 1976, [...] Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels parodied such offers with an on-air announcement that he would pay the Beatles $3,000 if they would perform on his program together. He joked, [...] "divide [...] up <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> If {{you want to give}} less to Ringo, that's up to you."

2500|$|In March 1972 Alison MacCallum issued {{her first}} solo single, [...] "Superman", [...] on RCA Records {{which was written}} by Harry Vanda and George Young (both ex-The Easybeats). It reached No.12 on Go-Sets National Top40 and No.8 on the Kent Music Report. The B-side was a Ted Mulry ( [...] Martin Mulry) {{composition}} [...] "Take Me Back". Also that month she released her debut solo album, Fresh Water, a reference to her former band. It was produced by United Kingdom producer Simon Napier-Bell, {{who had worked with}} The Yardbirds and T.Rex. John Tait described Napier-Bell's work as re-invigorating Vanda & Young's songwriting career [...] "Ted Albert assigned him the task of finding artists to record some of the songs Harry and George were sending over from London. The most notable of these demos was a rock tune called 'Superman' ... matched the song up with the soaring voice of session singer Alison MacCallum, added some brass to the original arrangement and suddenly they had a hit on their hands". Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, noted Fresh Waters [...] "mix of rock, jazz and blues material proved to be a fine showcase for her expressive voice". In March 1974 it was re-released as, <b>Any</b> <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> Me.|$|E
2500|$|On The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' year-end list in 2011, [...] "Countdown" [...] {{was ranked}} at number two.

Charles Aaron of Spin magazine placed [...] "Countdown" [...] at number two on his list of the 20 Best Songs of 2011, writing: [...] "'Countdown' is Beyoncé's gangsta throwdown as an artiste, bumping and grinding and skipping and skating and caressing and catcalling and bearing witness all over the beat like nobody since MJ [...] — full stop. The Afro brass blasts, the minimalist synth boop boop, the jazzy Boyz II Men breakdown, the syncopated shiftiness back-to-front. A masterpiece, with legs for days." [...] Rolling Stone ranked the song at number eight on its list of the 50 Best Singles of 2011, writing {{that it is a}} triumphal love song, [...] "slathered in crazy sauce; marching-band drums, backward-counting backup singers, honking horns", and praising its hook. Additionally, Rob Sheffield ranked the song at number 3 on his list of The Top 25 Songs of 2011 writing, [...] "The harder she tries to come on crazy, the less crazy she sounds. She might be the most aggressively sane pop diva ever, even when she's boofing her boof boof." [...] Consequence of Sound's staff placed [...] "Countdown" [...] at number four on their list of the Top 50 Songs of 2011 and wrote, [...] "Beyoncé has transcended the traditional confines of pop diva status ... Queen B has built an empire of love songs and tributes to her boo(s), but none, be it on this album or the three before, come off as easily and thoroughly as they do here. We dare anyone to resist falling under the spell of the chorus, ... the sing-along-ability, the bombastic nature, and the beat...

2500|$|Blake’s {{internally}} braced hollow wooden surfboards {{were eventually}} superseded by laminated boards with an interior layer of balsa, then by foam-and-fiberglass designs, but {{another of his}} innovations remains a fixture of modern surf- and paddleboards, the [...] "skeg" [...] or fin. Traditional surfboards were flat-bottomed, but in 1935, Blake experimented by tearing the keel off an old speedboat and attaching it {{to the bottom of}} a surfboard. Blake later remembered, [...] "I finally put the fin on the board and went out in the surf, paddled out. In paddling out, the board had an entirely different feeling with the skeg on it, it wasn't entirely a likable feeling... But I got a pretty good wave and right away found the remarkable control you had over the board with the skeg on it. It didn't spin out, it steered easy, because the tail held steady when you put the pressure on the front. You could [...] turn it <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> it.

[...] The Everly Brothers also released it as a single in 1969, under the variant title [...] "Carolina on My Mind", but it failed to chart; this was later collected on their 1994 box set Heartaches and Harmonies.
