Shiller was the only alderman who did not cast {{a vote on the}} passage of the Big Box Ordinance, which required large retailers to pay <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>wage.</b> Target sent a letter to Mayor Daley and alderman indicating that if the ordinance were not overturned, they would not proceed on projects in Chicago. Shiller voted to sustain Daley's veto.|$|E

5|$|Articles 41–43 mandate the State to {{endeavour}} to secure to all citizens the right to work, <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>wage,</b> social security, maternity relief, and a decent standard of living. These provisions aim at establishing a socialist state as envisaged in the Preamble. Article 43 also places upon the State the responsibility of promoting cottage industries, {{and the federal government}} has, in furtherance of this, established several Boards for the promotion of khadi, handlooms etc., in coordination with the state governments. Article 39A requires the State to provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are available to all citizens irrespective of economic or other disabilities. Article 43A mandates the State to work towards securing the participation of workers in the management of industries. The State, under Article 46, is also mandated to promote the interests of and work for the economic uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and protect them from discrimination and exploitation. Several enactments, including two Constitutional amendments, have been passed to give effect to this provision.|$|E

5|$|Since 1863, Verne {{had been}} under {{contract}} with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, who published each of his novels, beginning with Five Weeks in a Balloon (1863) and Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and continuing {{through the rest of}} his books to form the novel sequence Hetzel called the Voyages Extraordinaires. The arrangement gave Verne prominence as a novelist and a certain amount of financial stability, but {{under the terms of the}} contract Verne's profits barely earned him <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>wage.</b> Verne's fortunes changed markedly in 1874, when the stage adaptation of his novel Around the World in Eighty Days was a smash hit, running for 415 performances in its original production and quickly making Verne wealthy as well as famous as a playwright. Adapted with the collaboration of the showman d'Ennery, the play invented and codified the pièce de grand spectacle, an extravagant theatrical genre that became intensely popular in Paris throughout the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Verne and d'Ennery went on to adapt two other Verne novels, The Children of Captain Grant and Michael Strogoff, as similarly spectacular plays.|$|E

25|$|Asda {{has signed}} up to the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) which respects workers' rights for freedom of {{association}} and <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>wage.</b> Implementing this initiative is difficult, however, because the concept of <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> varies by country and the buying strategies of a major importer like Asda have an indirect impact on national minimum wages by obliging governments to set them low enough to stop businesses from going elsewhere. Industry pressure groups such as Labour Behind the Label and War on Want have argued that Asda and other budget retailers use unethical labour practices {{in the developing world}} to keep UK prices low.|$|E
25|$|The Mexican Revolution of 1910–1920 {{produced}} the Constitution of 1917, which contained Article 123 that gave workers {{the right to}} organise labour unions and to strike.

50|$|Halfon {{has talked}} {{about the need to}} reduce tax for workers, arguing that <b>a</b> near <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> could be {{achieved}} if the Government reintroduced the 10p band of income tax or increased the National Insurance threshold, citing this {{as an alternative to the}} <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> which he says could damage small, local businesses.|$|R
25|$|The Industrial Revolution brought many {{concerns}} about the deteriorating working and living conditions of urban workers. Influenced by the German Bishop Wilhelm Emmanuel Freiherr von Ketteler, in 1891 Pope Leo XIII published the encyclical Rerum novarum, which set in context Catholic social teaching in terms that rejected socialism but advocated the regulation of working conditions.

25|$|Traditionally, {{workers in}} 3D professions are well paid, {{due to the}} undesirability of the work, and the {{resulting}} need to pay higher wages to attract workers.

This concept proves itself in the economic theory of quantity supplied and quantity demanded (see Quantity adjustment), the wages paid to these workers is higher due to the undesirable nature of their professions.|$|E

Specifically the proposed act will guarantee that workers in large developmental projects will receive a wage of at least $10.00 <b>an</b> hour. The <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> will get indexed so that it keeps up with cost of living increases. Furthermore, the act will require that employees who do not receive health insurance from their employer will receive an additional $1.50 an hour to subsidize their healthcare expenses.
