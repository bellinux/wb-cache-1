Extra chairs had been brought into the great drawing-room, and in all there must have been two hundred Philomaths that sat down to hear Ernest. They were truly lords of society. I amused myself with running over in my mind the sum of the fortunes represented, and it ran well into the hundreds of millions. And the possessors were not of the idle rich. They were men of affairs who took most <b>active</b> <b>parts</b> <b>in</b> industrial and political life.|$|R

5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{consists of}} setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game– for example, {{where to place}} different pieces– while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These {{two parts of the}} chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play. A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take a more <b>active</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.|$|E

Gbongan fought as an ally of Ibadan in the Modakeke war of 1881-86, and this was why almost all Modakeke moved en-masse to settle in Gbongan on March 27, 1909 before Ode Omu was founded in 1910 for those Modakeke who chose to settle in a separate town.|$|R

5|$|Lord Hailsham {{left his}} {{position}} in 1938 due to his failing health, {{and was replaced by}} Lord Maugham, who was appointed on 15 March. His appointment was done on Schuster's advice and was considered quite a surprise as he had no real political experience; even Maugham himself admitted he had not expected to be offered the job. Schuster and Maugham had a difficult relationship, especially after the start of the Second World War in 1939, due to their differing political opinions. Schuster did not play an <b>active</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> policy decisions in this period, partially because of his disagreements with Maugham and partially because Maugham preferred to work on legislation and policy changes himself. Schuster later said that he got on with all of his Lord Chancellors except one—Maugham.|$|E

In May of that year, Reitz took an <b>active</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the peace negotiations with the British, {{and he was one of}} the signatories of the Treaty of Vereeniging, signed in Pretoria on 31 May 1902.|$|E
5|$|The Grodno Sejm, held in {{the fall}} of 1793, {{nominated}} him for a membership in a military commission; this caused him to be viewed with suspicion by the majority of the dissatisfied military, and he {{was not included in the}} preparations for the upcoming uprising. Thus he was taken by surprise when the Kościuszko Insurrection erupted, and his own brigade mutinied. He declared his support for the insurgents after the libation of Warsaw, and from then on took an <b>active</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the uprising, defending Warsaw and leading an army corps in support of an uprising in Greater Poland.
