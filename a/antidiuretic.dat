5|$|Very severe {{hypothyroidism}} and myxedema coma are characteristically {{associated with}} low sodium {{levels in the}} blood together with elevations in <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone, as well as acute worsening of kidney function due {{to a number of}} causes.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located at}} the base of the brain, and intimately connected with the hypothalamus. It consists of two lobes: the posterior pituitary, which consists of nervous tissue branching out of the hypothalamus, and the anterior pituitary, which consists of hormone-producing epithelium. The posterior pituitary secretes <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone, which regulates osmolarity of the blood, and oxytocin, which causes contractions of the uterus in childbirth and participates in breastfeeding.|$|E
5|$|<b>Antidiuretic</b> hormone (ADH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} the syndrome of diabetes insipidus (unrelated to diabetes mellitus): inability to concentrate the urine, leading to polyuria (production of large amounts of clear urine) that is low in solutes, dehydration and—in compensation—extreme thirst and constant need to drink (polydipsia), as well as hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood). ADH deficiency may be masked if there is ACTH deficiency, with symptoms only appearing when cortisol has been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the type}} of tumor, paraneoplastic phenomena—symptoms not due to the local {{presence}} of cancer—may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, these phenomena may include hypercalcemia, syndrome of inappropriate <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic ACTH production, or Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to autoantibodies). Tumors {{in the top of the}} lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to Horner's syndrome (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the brachial plexus.|$|E
5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E
5|$|Hyponatremia, {{an unusually}} {{low level of}} sodium in the blood that may cause {{confusion}} and seizures, is found in 40% of cases. This {{may be caused by}} low cortisol levels or by inappropriate release of <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the subacute phase. 50% have a deficiency in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to undersecretion of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. 75% develop a deficiency to gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which control the reproductive hormone glands. This leads to a disrupted menstrual cycle, infertility and decreased libido.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome depends on findings such as rapid development of muscle paralysis, absent reflexes, absence of fever, and a likely cause. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (through a lumbar spinal puncture) and nerve conduction studies are supportive investigations commonly {{performed in the}} {{diagnosis of}} GBS. Testing for antiganglioside antibodies is often performed, but their contribution to diagnosis is usually limited. Blood tests are generally performed to exclude the possibility of another cause for weakness, such as {{a low level of}} potassium in the blood. An abnormally low level of sodium in the blood is often encountered in Guillain–Barré syndrome. This has been attributed to the inappropriate secretion of <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone, leading to relative retention of water.|$|E
5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering {{the products of the}} effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and estradiol for female hypogonadism (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). <b>Antidiuretic</b> hormone {{can be replaced}} by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E
25|$|Cortisol {{inhibits}} secretion of <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol {{has been}} known to {{mitigate}} the production of <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone, which is a hormone that acts on the kidney to favour water reabsorption in the kidneys during filtration. This occurs because alcohol confuses osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which relay osmotic pressure information to the posterior pituitary, the site of <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone release. Alcohol causes the osmoreceptors to signal that there is low osmotic pressure in the blood, which triggers an inhibition of the <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone. As a consequence, one's kidneys are no longer able to reabsorb as much water as they should be absorbing, leading to creation of excessive volumes of urine and the subsequent overall dehydration.|$|E
25|$|Stimulation of the {{posterior}} pituitary to release vasopressin (<b>antidiuretic</b> hormone, ADH) also acts on the kidneys to increase water retention. If ADH production is excessive in heart failure, Na+ {{level in the}} plasma may fall (hyponatremia), {{and this is a}} sign of increased risk of death in heart failure patients.|$|E
25|$|Any sign of low blood sodium (hyponatremia) or {{weakness}} {{should be}} treated {{with the addition of}} hematin, heme arginate, or even tin mesoporphyrin, as these are signs of impending syndrome of inappropriate <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone (SIADH) or peripheral nervous system involvement that may be localized or severe, progressing to bulbar paresis and respiratory paralysis.|$|E
25|$|The kidney {{participates in}} whole-body homeostasis, {{regulating}} acid-base balance, electrolyte concentrations, extracellular fluid volume, and blood pressure. The kidney accomplishes these homeostatic functions both independently and {{in concert with}} other organs, particularly those of the endocrine system. Various endocrine hormones coordinate these endocrine functions; these include renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone, and atrial natriuretic peptide, among others.|$|E
25|$|Baroreceptors in low {{pressure}} receptor zones (mainly in the venae cavae and the pulmonary veins, {{and in the}} atria) result in feedback by regulating the secretion of <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone (ADH/Vasopressin), renin and aldosterone. The resultant increase in blood volume results in an increased cardiac output by the Frank–Starling law of the heart, in turn increasing arterial blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Maintaining {{water and}} salt {{level of the}} body. Any {{significant}} rise in plasma osmolality is detected by the hypothalamus, which communicates directly with the posterior pituitary gland. An increase in osmolality causes the gland to secrete <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone (ADH), resulting in water reabsorption by the kidney {{and an increase in}} urine concentration. The two factors work together to return the plasma osmolality to its normal levels.|$|E
25|$|DDAVP (desmopressin) tablets are a {{synthetic}} replacement for <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone, the hormone that reduces urine production during sleep. Desmopressin is usually {{used in the}} form of desmopressin acetate, DDAVP. Patients taking DDAVP are 4.5 times more likely to stay dry than those taking a placebo. The drug replaces the hormone for that night with no cumulative effect. US drug regulators have banned using desmopressin nasal sprays for treating bedwetting since the oral form is considered safer.|$|E
25|$|Tolvaptan and conivaptan antagonize {{the effects}} of <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone (vasopressin), thereby {{promoting}} the specific excretion of free water, directly ameliorating the volume overloaded state, and counteracting the hyponatremia that occurs due {{to the release of}} neuroendocrine hormones in an attempt to counteract {{the effects of}} heart failure. The EVEREST trial, which utilized tolvaptan, showed that when used in combination with conventional therapy, many symptoms of acute decompensated heart failure were significantly improved compared to conventional therapy alone although they found no difference in mortality and morbidity when compared to conventional therapy.|$|E
25|$|The first {{ability is}} a hormone cycle {{that reduces the}} body's urine production. At about sunset each day, the body {{releases}} a minute burst of <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone (also known as arginine vasopressin or AVP). This hormone burst reduces the kidney's urine output well into the night so that the bladder does not get full until morning. This hormone cycle is not present at birth. Many children develop it {{between the ages of}} two and six years old, others between six and the end of puberty, and some not at all.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of oxytocin {{is very similar}} to that of the vasopressins: It is also a nonapeptide with a disulfide bridge and its amino acid sequence differs at only two positions (see table below). The two genes are located on the same chromosome separated by a relatively small distance of less than 15,000 bases in most species. The magnocellular neurons that secrete vasopressin are adjacent to magnocellular neurons that secrete oxytocin, and are similar in many respects. The similarity of the two peptides can cause some cross-reactions: oxytocin has a slight <b>antidiuretic</b> function, and high levels of AVP can cause uterine contractions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} types of DI, each with a {{different}} set of causes. Central DI (CDI) is {{due to a lack of}} the hormone vasopressin (<b>antidiuretic</b> hormone). This can be due to damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland or genetics. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) occurs when the kidneys do not respond properly to vasopressin. Dipsogenic DI is due to abnormal thirst mechanisms in the hypothalamus while gestational DI occurs only during pregnancy. Diagnosis is often based on urine tests, blood tests, and the fluid deprivation test. Diabetes mellitus is a separate condition with an unrelated mechanism, though both can result in the production of large amounts of urine.|$|E
25|$|Vasopressin receptors {{activated}} by vasopressin are {{found on the}} basolateral membrane of the cells lining the collecting ducts of the kidneys. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage(aSAH) results in hyponatremia which leads to water retention and <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone release causing increase in intracranial pressure and formation of cerebral edema. This can be prevented by administration of conivaptan, a safe FDA approved drug that treats euvolemic hyponatremia. Through the process of aquaresis, conivapten which is a vasopressin receptor antagonist improves serum sodium concentration while eliminating free water without having any negative effect on systolic blood pressure and pulse rate. Since it can decrease cerebral volume and ICP, it has a potential to treat many forms of cerebral edema.|$|E
25|$|Diabetes insipidus* in dogs can be central, {{caused by}} a lack of <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone (ADH), or nephrogenic, {{caused by a}} lack of {{response}} of the kidneys to ADH. Neither form is common. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is usually idiopathic, but can also be caused by head trauma or tumors of the brain. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) can be primary (hereditary) or secondary (caused by a variety of metabolic and renal diseases, including Cushing's syndrome and pyometra). Because the disease is characterized by an inability to concentrate urine, the most common sign is increased drinking and urinating. Treatment of CDI is to use desmopressin, a synthetic analog of ADH. Treatment of NDI is to treat the underlying cause, if any.|$|E
25|$|Syndrome of Inappropriate <b>Antidiuretic</b> Hormone {{secretion}} (SIADH) in turn can {{be caused}} by a number of problems. Some forms of cancer can cause SIADH, particularly small cell lung carcinoma but also a number of other tumors. A variety of diseases affecting the brain or the lung (infections, bleeding) can be the driver behind SIADH. A number of drugs has been associated with SIADH, such as certain antidepressants (serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants), the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, oxytocin (used to induce and stimulate labor), and the chemotherapy drug vincristine. It has also been associated with fluoroquinolones (including ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin). Finally, it can occur without a clear explanation. Hyponatremia can be treated pharmaceutically through the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} {{hyponatremia}} are typically classified by a person's body fluid status into low volume, normal volume, or high volume. Low volume hyponatremia can occur from diarrhea, vomiting, diuretics, and sweating. Normal volume hyponatremia {{is divided into}} cases with dilute urine and concentrated urine. Cases in which the urine is dilute include adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and drinking too much water or too much beer. Cases in which the urine is concentrated include syndrome of inappropriate <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone secretion (SIADH). High volume hyponatremia can occur from heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure. Conditions {{that can lead to}} falsely low sodium measurements include high blood protein levels such as in multiple myeloma, high blood fat levels, and high blood sugar.|$|E
500|$|Doctors {{who treated}} a 15-year-old female {{suffering}} from mephedrone intoxication suggested in The Lancet that, like MDMA, mephedrone may promote serotonin-mediated release of <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone, resulting in hyponatraemia and an altered mental state. In another case, a 19-year-old male {{was admitted to}} hospital suffering from inflammation of the heart, 20 hours after taking one gram of mephedrone. The doctors treating the patient stated it was caused by either a direct toxic effect of mephedrone on the heart muscle, or by an immune response. One case of acquired methaemoglobinaemia, where a patient had [...] "bluish lips and fingers", has also been reported, after the user snorted one gram of mephedrone. The patient started to recover after arriving {{at the hospital and}} it was not necessary to administer any medication.|$|E

2500|$|Syndrome of {{inappropriate}} secretion of <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone (SIADH) — a potentially fatal reaction to certain medications that {{is due to}} an excessive release of <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone — a hormone that prevents the production of urine by increasing the reabsorption of fluids in the kidney — this results {{in the development of}} various electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hyponatraemia , hypokalaemia , hypocalcaemia [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Desmopressin is a {{synthetic}} analog {{of the natural}} <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone vasopressin. [...] Its overuse can lead to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia with consequent convulsion.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the common}} ostrich is in a {{dehydrated}} state plasma osmolality, [...] Na+, K+, and Cl- ions all increase, however, K+ ions returned to controlled concentration. The common ostrich also experiences {{an increase in}} haematocrit, resulting in a hypovolemic state. Two <b>antidiuretic</b> hormones, Arginine vasotocin (AVT) and angiotensin (AII) are increased in blood plasma {{as a response to}} [...] and hypovolemia. AVT triggers <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone (ADH) which targets the nephrons of the kidney. ADH causes a reabsorption of water from the lumen of the nephron to the extracellular fluid osmotically. These extracellular fluids then drain into blood vessels, causing a rehydrating effect. This drainage prevents loss of water by both lowering volume and increasing concentration of the urine. Angiotensin, on the other hand, causes vasoconstriction on the systemic arterioles, and acts as a dipsogen for ostriches. Both of these <b>antidiuretic</b> hormones work together to maintain water levels in the body that would normally be lost due to the osmotic stress of the arid environment.|$|E
2500|$|By {{action of}} the urea {{transporter}} 2, some of this reabsorbed urea eventually flows back into the thin descending limb of the tubule, through the collecting ducts, and into the excreted urine. [...] The body uses this mechanism, which {{is controlled by the}} <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone, to create hyperosmotic urine—i.e., urine with a higher concentration of dissolved substances than the blood plasma. This mechanism [...] is important to prevent the loss of water, maintain blood pressure, and maintain a suitable concentration of sodium ions in the blood plasma.|$|E
2500|$|Normal volume hyponatremia, {{wherein the}} {{increase}} in ADH is secondary to either physiologic but excessive ADH release (as occurs with nausea or severe pain) or inappropriate and non-physiologic secretion of ADH, that is, syndrome of inappropriate <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone hypersecretion (SIADH). [...] Often categorized under euvolemic is hyponatremia due to inadequate urine solute (not enough chemicals or electrolytes to produce urine) as occurs in beer potomania or [...] "tea and toast" [...] hyponatremia, hyponatremia due to hypothyroidism or central adrenal insufficiency, and those rare instances of hyponatremia that are truly secondary to excess water intake.|$|E
2500|$|Vasopressin, {{also named}} <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone (ADH), [...] {{arginine}} vasopressin (AVP) or argipressin, is a hormone synthesized as a peptide prohormone in neurons in the hypothalamus, and {{is converted to}} AVP. It then travels down the axon of that cell, which terminates in the posterior pituitary, and is released from vesicles into the circulation in response to extracellular fluid hypertonicity (hyperosmolality). AVP has two primary functions. First, it increases the amount of solute-free water reabsorbed back into the circulation from the filtrate in the kidney tubules of the nephrons. Second, AVP constricts arterioles, which increases peripheral vascular resistance and raises arterial blood pressure.|$|E
2500|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a disease}} in which the beta cells of the endocrine pancreas either stop producing insulin or can no longer produce it in enough quantity for the body's needs. The condition is commonly divided into two types, depending {{on the origin of}} the condition: Type 1 diabetes, sometimes called [...] "juvenile diabetes", is caused by destruction of the beta cells of the pancreas. The condition is also referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes, meaning exogenous insulin injections must replace the insulin the pancreas is no longer capable of producing for the body's needs. Dogs can have insulin-dependent, or Type 1, diabetes; research finds no Type 2 diabetes in dogs. Because of this, there is no possibility the permanently damaged pancreatic beta cells could re-activate to engender a remission as may be possible with some feline diabetes cases, where the primary type of diabetes is Type 2. There is another less common form of diabetes, diabetes insipidus, which is a condition of insufficient <b>antidiuretic</b> hormone or resistance to it.|$|E
