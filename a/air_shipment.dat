50|$|Indeed, {{a limited}} {{view of the}} role of {{long-range}} air transportation in World War II persisted for some months after the USA became an active belligerent. Not until the late spring and summer of 1942, when large backlogs of supplies awaiting <b>air</b> <b>shipment</b> to the front began to build up at ports of embarkation and {{when it became clear that}} almost unlimited demands would be made in future for the rapid movement of urgently needed materials and personnel, did the idea of air transport as a major instrument of logistics begin to take shape.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{technique}} in APEC <b>Air</b> <b>shipment</b> of live and fresh fish and seafood guidelines {{is described as}} follows: [...] "A cut is made {{toward the front of}} the flatfish severing the major artery and the spinal cord. Placement of the cut is made to preserve the greatest amount of flatfish flesh. This paralyzes the flatfish. A second cut is made in the tail to hasten the removal of blood. Flatfish are then chilled slowly to maintain circulation and facilitate the bleeding process. After the flatfish have been bled, they are transferred to a salt/ice water slurry and chilled to 12°C." ...|$|E
5000|$|By air: Over {{five percent}} of the global fish {{production}} is transported by air. Air transport needs special care in preparation and handling and careful scheduling. Airline transport hubs often require cargo transfers under their own tight schedules. This can influence when the product is delivered, and consequently the condition it is in when it is delivered. The <b>air</b> <b>shipment</b> of leaking seafood packages causes corrosion damage to aircraft, and each year, in the US, requires millions of dollars to repair the damage. Most airlines prefer fish that is packed in dry ice or gel, and not packed in ice.|$|E

50|$|Gordon Blythe had {{convinced}} MacRobertson Miller Airlines (MMA) to do a trial <b>air</b> <b>shipment</b> in May 1947 when four carcasses were slaughtered and {{left at the}} station at 2am, arriving in Perth in good condition at 3pm the same day. The trial being considered a success, a company Air Beef Ltd. was established as {{a joint venture between}} the Blythes, MMA and Australian National Airways (ANA), with each party putting up one quarter of the capital and the Western Australian Government (through the North West Development and Advisory Committee, which was headed by Russell Dumas), assisting and providing a loan for the remaining quarter. It was hoped that the scheme would spawn a network of inland abattoirs throughout northern Australia, however this did not eventuate; plans for a similar facility at Fitzroy Crossing were shelved.|$|E

50|$|On 7 July 1942 the Air Intransit Depot No. 6, {{staffed by}} {{experienced}} freight handlers of the Air Service Command {{was set up}} at the airport. The depot saved much cargo space by repackaging. A {{large proportion of the}} freight arriving at Miami at that time was packed in heavy wooden crates or other materials suitably designed for rail or water shipment but excessively heavy for <b>air</b> <b>shipment.</b> At one period during 1942, repacking was required on an estimated 40 per cent of the cargo arriving at Miami, with results calculated at a 30 per cent reduction in weight. The weight saved on some items was almost fantastic. A shipment of P-39 air scoops arriving at Miami weighed 128 pounds per unit, a figure reduced by repacking to 17 pounds. On another occasion, the depot received a package of four elevator assemblies having a total weight in excess of 1,000 pounds. When repacked in packages, each package weighed 108 pounds for a total saving of 588 pounds.|$|E
40|$|Romania {{successfully}} completed the world’s first <b>air</b> <b>shipment</b> of {{spent nuclear fuel}} transported in Type B(U) casks under existing international laws and without shipment license special exceptions when the last Romanian highly enriched uranium (HEU) spent nuclear fuel was transported to the Russian Federation in June 2009. This <b>air</b> <b>shipment</b> required the design, fabrication, and licensing of special 20 foot freight containers and cask tiedown supports to transport the eighteen TUK 19 shipping casks on a Russian commercial cargo aircraft. The new equipment was certified for transport by road, rail, water, and air to provide multi modal transport capabilities for shipping research reactor spent fuel. The equipment design, safety analyses, and fabrication were performed in the Russian Federation and transport licenses were issued by both the Russian and Romanian regulatory authorities. The spent fuel was transported by truck from the VVR S research reactor to the Bucharest airport, flown by commercial cargo aircraft to the airport at Yekaterinburg, Russia, and then transported by truck to the final destination in a secure nuclear facility at Chelyabinsk, Russia. This shipment of 23. 7 kg of HEU was coordinated by the Russian Research Reactor Fuel Return Program (RRRFR), {{as part of the}} U. S. Department of Energy Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI), in close cooperation with the Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation and the International Atomic Energy Agency, and was managed in Romania by the National Commission for Nuclear Activities Control (CNCAN).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn October 2015, the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) implemented {{a new global}} shipping performance assessment method. USTRANSCOM assesses shipping lane performance by analyzing {{the distribution of the}} start-to-finish shipping time for all requisitions during a given time period and comparing the 85 th quantile to an established time standard for the lane. The command assesses overall network performance using the total number of shipping lanes that perform better than the standard. Previously, USTRANSCOM grouped shipping lanes according to shipping method and destination with no consideration given the origin. The new method includes the origin information. Using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests and data analysis techniques, we show that the addition of requisition origin information enables more accurate analysis of the shipping network. Optimization provides node improvement recommendations. We find that focusing improvement on commercial air and military <b>air</b> <b>shipments</b> provide the greatest overall network performance increase. Captain, United States Arm...|$|R

Motivated by an industrial problem where planning decisions are independent of the scheduling decisions, we investigate the benefits of integrating the two sets of decisions. We develop sequence of mathematical models to address the planning and scheduling decisions. Preliminary computational results indicate improved performance of the integrated approach over some of the existing policies used in real-life situations. Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA...|$|E
40|$|We model {{supply chain}} of an {{industry}} solution equipment manufacturer, where the merchandise is sold worldwide, but suppliers are mostly located in Asia. The preferred shipment of supply is the ocean shipment, and it takes about 5 weeks. Premium <b>air</b> <b>shipment</b> {{can be used to}} ex-pedite delivery, but it costs substantially higher. To hedge against variability of demand and to satisfy customer ser-vice level, a certain level of safety stock is needed but in-ventory carrying cost can be high. Therefore, a careful ful-fillment strategy is very important to balance serviceability and cost. A supply chain simulation model is developed to analyze the order fulfillment and supply planning process for the business to identify efficient supply chain strategy. The model simulates and evaluates three key performance metrics; serviceability, inventory costs and premium trans-portation costs, and their interactions. ...|$|E
