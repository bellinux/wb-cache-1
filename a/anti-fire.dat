50|$|A {{large part}} of Whyte Avenue's {{popularity}} is the historical character of its buildings, {{many of which are}} one hundred years old. The oldest building is the Strathcona Hotel, built by the railway when it arrived in 1891. Early construction used mostly wood, but this changed in 1902 when the Town of Strathcona passed a bylaw requiring brick buildings in the downtown core to prevent a major fire. Many of the current brick buildings were erected during the 1910-1912 boom that brought thousands of settlers from eastern Canada, Britain and continental Europe, U.S. {{and other parts of the}} world. Whyte Avenue in the early 1890s was dominated by primitive shack homes and quickly-built pioneer stores. These early structures were soon replaced by more substantial wood-frame two-storey buildings or, in the case of the Ross Block, by a brick building even before the town's <b>anti-fire</b> bylaw.|$|E

40|$|A fire {{on board}} a ship {{presents}} special challenges. It requires not only special <b>anti-fire</b> devices but well-trained teams of firefighters. Since crews rotate periodically, {{there is a need}} for ongoing personnel training and not all crew members have the same amount of training. A significant problem is how to assess the effectiveness of a team of firefighters with different skills in a real situation. A team should work together efficiently and follow standard procedures correctly if it is to successfully extinguish the fire within a reasonable period of time and with minimum damage. The question is: What skills are of most importance to a successful team of firefighters? It is difficult to carry out physical experiments without risking human lives and material losses.

Secondly, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis on the urban fire risk from the respects of risk of fire accidents in urban areas, urban vulnerability and urban <b>anti-fire</b> capability.

40|$|Asbestos is {{a generic}} name given to six fibrous {{minerals}} (chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, anthophyllite, tremolite and actinolite asbestos), {{widely used in}} commercial products. Asbestos fibers are characterized by high tensile strength, flexibility, resistance to chemical attack and thermal degradation, large surface area and ability to be woven.

The aim of this work is to characterize asbestos fibers using image analysis as in previous work (Inoue et al., 1999), it is carried out in four steps: (i) image acquisition from airborne fibers samples; (ii) fibers identification by image segmentation; (iii) fibers analysis and features extraction, by dimension, shape, color and texture measurements; (iv) fibers classification...|$|E

In the field of materials, <b>anti-fire</b> properties opens up new perspectives. The difference between polyesters and polyphosphoesters in terms of synthesis and properties will be highlighted.
