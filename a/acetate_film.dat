500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Little Ferry facility spurred an interest in fire safety as an aspect of film preservation. Unlike previous large nitrate film fires, the spontaneous combustion of decomposing film stock {{was determined to be}} responsible. Investigators suggested that the older nitrocellulose film stored in the archive was of lower quality than then-current film and thus more prone to instability. The Society of Motion Picture Engineers's Committee on Preservation of Film, three months after the vault fire, cited [...] "recent and rather extensive film fires" [...] as evidence that existing preservation efforts had failed to adequately address the [...] "fire problem". More heavily reinforced film vaults were suggested, to prevent fires in a single vault from destroying entire archival facilities. Film storage cabinets with ventilation and cooling systems were also proposed, as was further research into improving the quality of cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>film</b> to encourage its use as a safer replacement for nitrate film.|$|E
2500|$|An early special type {{of plastic}} film {{capacitors}} were the cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>film</b> capacitors, also called MKU capacitors. The polar insulating dielectric cellulose acetate was a synthetic resin {{that could be}} made for metallized capacitors in paint film thickness down to about 3µm. [...] A liquid layer of cellulose acetate was first applied to a paper carrier, then covered with wax, dried and then metallized. During winding of the capacitor body, the paper was removed from the metallized film. The remaining thin cellulose acetate layer had a dielectric breakdown of 63V, enough for many of general purpose applications. The very small thickness of the dielectric decreased the overall dimensions of these capacitors compared to other film capacitors of the time. MKU film capacitors are no longer manufactured, because polyester film capacitors can now be produced in the smaller sizes that were the market niche of the MKU type.|$|E

5000|$|Cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>film</b> was {{introduced}} in 1934 {{as a replacement for}} the cellulose nitrate film stock that had previously been standard. When exposed to heat or moisture, acids in the film base begin to deteriorate to an unusable state, releasing acetic acid with a characteristic vinegary smell, causing the process to be known as [...] "vinegar syndrome." [...] <b>Acetate</b> <b>film</b> stock is still used in some applications, such as camera negative for motion pictures. Since the 1980s, polyester film stock (sometimes referred to under Kodak's trade name [...] "ESTAR Base") has become more commonplace, particularly for archival applications. <b>Acetate</b> <b>film</b> was also used as the base for magnetic tape, prior to the advent of polyester film.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results obtained}} on the preparation of films composed of linter cellulose and the corresponding acetates. The acetylation was carried out in the LiCl/DMAc solvent system. Films were prepared from a LiCl/DMAc solution of cellulose acetates (degree of substitution, DS 0. 8 – 2. 9) mixed with linter cellulose (5, 10 and 15 wt %). Detailed characterization of the films revealed the following: (i) they exhibited fibrous structures on their surfaces. The strong tendency of the linter cellulose chains to aggregate in LiCl/DMAc suggests that these fibrous elements consist of cellulose chains, as can be deduced from SEM images of the film of cellulose proper; (ii) the cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>films</b> obtained from samples with DS 2. 1 and 2. 9 exhibited microspheres on the surface, whose formation seems to be favored for acetates with higher DS; (iii) AFM analysis showed that, in general, the presence of cellulose increased both the asperity thickness and the surface roughness of the analyzed films, indicating that cellulose chains are at least partially organized in domains and not molecularly dispersed between acetate chains; and (iv) the films prepared from cellulose and acetates exhibited lower hygroscopicity than the <b>acetate</b> <b>films,</b> also suggesting that the cellulose chains are organized into domains, probably due to strong intermolecular interactions. The linter and sisal acetates (the latter from a prior study), and their respective films, were prepared using the same processes; however, the two sets of films presented more differences (as in humidity absorption, optical, and tensile properties) than similarities (as in some morphological aspects), most likely due to the different properties of the starting materials.
