5|$|Admiral Scheer and Admiral Graf Spee {{had some}} {{improvements}} in armor thickness. The barbettes, 100mm thick in Deutschland, became 125mm {{for the two}} sisters.

The armored deck was improved as well, and some places had up to 70mm thickness.|$|E

In addition, during the early 1980s, plans were proposed for the reactivation of the U.S. Navy's Iowa-class battleships that entailed the removal of each ship's aft turret and the installation of a flight deck for operating V/STOL aircraft; in the end <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> modest conversion, lacking the flight deck, was carried out.|$|E

5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|Hospices: While late {{referral}} to hospice is <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> prevalent problem than early referral, some hospice providers will hesitate to admit patients to hospice (or they may de-certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients {{deemed to be}} on hospice too long. After a patient has been on hospice for six months, Medicare is more aggressive in auditing the hospice for inappropriate payment of services. For some hospices this is simply not worth the trouble, and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of stelae {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the Maya region, displaying a wide stylistic variation.

5|$|In 2004, an R-rated director's cut of Daredevil was released, reincorporating {{approximately}} 30 {{minutes of}} the film, including a subplot involving a character played by Coolio, and it received slightly more acclaim from critics than the theatrical version.
