25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and I asked for permission to take him out. But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused my request. John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. Just call Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like <b>an</b> <b>asshole.</b> He was too embarrassed even to ask me for help.|$|E

500|$|Vincent D'Onofrio's {{character}} in [...] "Subway" [...] partially inspired {{the creation of}} the antagonist played by Bryan Cranston in [...] "Drive", a sixth season episode of The X-Files, which first aired on November 15, 1998. In the episode, Cranston's character is unpleasant and anti-semitic, but he is dying throughout the episode, and screenwriter Vince Gilligan intended for the audience to sympathize with him despite his unlikeable qualities. Gilligan said that this was influenced by [...] "Subway", which he called an [...] "amazing episode". He said of D'Onofio's character: [...] "The brilliant thing they did in this episode, the thing that stuck with me, was this guy's <b>an</b> <b>asshole,</b> the guy really is unpleasant, and yet at the end (you) still feel his humanity." [...] The casting of Cranston in this role directly led Gilligan to eventually cast him as the lead in his television series Breaking Bad.|$|E
500|$|After the tour, Ocean was {{slated to}} perform at several music festivals, {{including}} Lollapalooza, where he headlined {{the second day of}} the festival. During an August performance at Øyafestivalen in Norway, Ocean lost his voice and ended his set early. He later withdrew from his European tour dates altogether, including English rock band Coldplay's Mylo Xyloto Tour, on which he would have been the opening act during the tour's European leg in August and September. Although he did not specify his reason, Ocean issued a statement to organizers of the Way Out West Festival in Sweden, saying that [...] "Let me start by saying I feel like <b>an</b> <b>asshole</b> right now, but a tough decision had to be made in regard to my schedule over the next months ...

500|$|The {{episode was}} written to humanize Sawyer {{and set up}} the love {{triangle}} between him, Kate and Jack. Kate was meant to look at Sawyer in a new way, and, according to Lindelof, think, [...] "wow, this guy is not just a belligerent." [...] The episode also shows the moral ambiguity of some characters by revealing more of their personalities, with the ones introduced as protagonists doing things that are generally not viewed as protagonist-like– an example being Jack beating Sawyer and eventually asking Sayid to torture him; and an antagonistic character, Sawyer, proving not to be solely antagonist-like– an example being his backstory and flashback, which show that he is not exclusively evil. Lindelof explained that he wanted Sawyer to [...] "come out of his shell a little, and say to the audience, 'you're supposed to like this guy'", further explaining, [...] "the root of him being <b>an</b> <b>asshole</b> is that these horrible things happened to him {{when he was a little}} kid, and he's really really angry." ...|$|E

500|$|With the film's success, it was {{immediately}} decided to finish Superman II. Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler {{did not ask}} Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film's publicity phase. Donner commented in January 1979, [...] "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as {{he has nothing to}} say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then they need to go out and find another director, it sure as shit ain't gonna be me." [...] Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a cameo appearance for Superman III, and not a main supporting role. Jack O'Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, [...] "It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big <b>an</b> <b>asshole</b> as the Salkinds." [...] Two more films, Superman III (1983) and [...] (1987), were produced. Superman Returns was released in 2006.

500|$|Between 2013 and 2016, Sheen {{starred in}} and {{produced}} Showtime's Masters of Sex. He and Lizzy Caplan portrayed the 1960s human sexuality pioneers Masters and Johnson; the series chronicled [...] "their unusual lives, romance and pop culture trajectory, which saw them {{go from a}} Midwestern teaching hospital to the cover of Time magazine and Johnny Carson's couch". David Sims of The Atlantic described Sheen's portrayal of Masters as [...] "an intensely honest and unsympathetic one" [...] while Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club said Sheen played the role [...] "so seamlessly it's hard to remember that there's a British actor there who has played flamboyant news personalities and prime ministers." [...] Sean T. Collins of The Observer described Masters as [...] "a singularly unappealing figure": [...] "It's not that Michael Sheen is bad in the role. On the contrary! Sheen's skill in playing Masters as <b>an</b> <b>asshole</b> who oscillates between headache-inducing self-repression and volcanic rage renders him unpleasant {{to spend more than}} two minutes with at a time." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter remarked: [...] "Masters has never been very likable. In fact, it's a testament to Sheen's performance — and Caplan's nuanced Johnson offsetting Masters — that anyone still cares what happens to Masters on a personal level." [...] He received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in late 2013.|$|E

Veteran critic Pål Bang-Hansen, who saw the film at Cannes Film Festival, enthusiastically exclaimed: [...] "Bjørn Floberg is the foremost villain of Norwegian film. In this film he is more of <b>an</b> <b>asshole</b> than ever". Dagbladets Inger Bentzrud commended the actors, but noted that all of Cleve Broch, Floberg, and Ahmed Zeyan played similar roles in Uno.

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the 2004 election, the {{character}} was fully developed.

[...] Head writer Allison Silverman reiterated this trait in a later interview, commenting, [...] "There is an essential innocence to his character." [...] Colbert initially felt the character might not be sustainable in a longer format. Despite this, The Colbert Report was designed {{as an extension of the}} satiric goals of The Daily Show, combining it with general silliness and character-driven humor. To make sure there was no overlap in subject matter with The Daily Show, Karlin made trips between the studios during the show's early days to supervise scripts. For the first several years of the program, Colbert made an appearance at the end of each Daily Show in split-screen, having a short discussion with Stewart preceding his show.|$|E
