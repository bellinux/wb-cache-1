50|$|The victorious Battle of Doliana was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> morale <b>boost</b> for the {{irregular}} Greek army.

25|$|I {{was playing}} good golf, {{but it really}} wasn't {{that big a deal}} to me one way or the other. And then my father died and I sort of {{realized}} that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>boost.</b>|$|E
25|$|The third quarter-final {{featured}} a storied and contentious rivalry. Russia played against Canada in {{a repeat of}} the quarter-finals at the 2010 Olympics, in which Canada embarrassed the Russians 7–3. The opening period was a dead heat until a late goal by Maxim Afinogenov. Russia, still undefeated at the tournament, immediately overtook Canada in the second period, and led {{at one point in the}} third period by 4–0.

50|$|It {{should be}} noted that the IT {{industry}} in Jordan in the year 2000 and beyond got <b>a</b> very <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> after the Gulf War of 1991. This boost came from a large influx of immigrants from the Gulf countries to Jordan, mostly from Jordanian expatriates from Kuwait, totaling few hundred thousands. This large wave impacted Jordan in many ways, and one of them was on its IT industry.|$|R
5000|$|Sony Music Entertainment President Tommy Mottola {{suggested}} that Vandross record Songs, {{an album of}} cover versions. Featuring Vandross' versions of songs like Stephen Stills' [...] "Love the One You're With", Heatwave's [...] "Always and Forever", and Roberta Flack's [...] "Killing Me Softly", the album was {{shaping up to be}} a major career accomplishment. To give the album <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>boost,</b> Mottola's then-wife, Mariah Carey, {{came up with the idea}} to remake [...] "Endless Love" [...] as a duet with her. Lionel Richie and Diana Ross had originally recorded [...] "Endless Love" [...] in 1981, and the song spent nine weeks at number 1. Although Luther's album was already set to contain one Lionel Richie composition, [...] "Hello", it was obvious that having the most-popular female singer on the Sony label singing on the album would be a benefit.|$|R
25|$|Following a punt {{from each}} team, Brooks' 7-yard punt return gave the Packers {{the ball on}} their 49-yard line, where they {{proceeded}} to drive to a Jacke 28-yard field goal at the 5:35 mark to make it 16–10. Once again the Lions got <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> from their special teams unit, this time a 27-yard return by Eric Lynch that gave them a first down on the Packers 49. Detroit subsequently drove to the Green Bay 11, including a 3-yard sneak by Krieg on fourth down and 1. But {{over the next three}} plays, Sanders gained two yards, Krieg threw an incomplete pass, and then he was sacked by linebacker Bryce Paup for a 6-yard loss. On fourth down and 14 from the 17-yard line, Detroit wide receiver Herman Moore caught Krieg's pass {{at the back of the}} end zone, but came out of bounds past the end line, causing a turnover on downs. Afterwards, Green Bay ran out the rest of the clock, giving up an intentional safety when punter Craig Hentrich ran out of the end zone on the last play of the contest.|$|E
2500|$|The show got <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> in viewership {{when the}} Battlefield 1 first-person shooter video game {{developed}} by EA DICE {{and published by}} Electronic Arts was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on October 21, 2016.

25|$|Baum {{hoped that}} the movie would be a success, and provide <b>a</b> <b>big</b> {{publicity}} <b>boost</b> to the Scarecrow novel to follow in 1915. Things did not quite work out as the optimistic author hoped; the film did not earn enough to cover its costs. The first edition of the novel sold around 14,300 copies, only a couple hundred more than its predecessor, Tik-Tok of Oz—though {{in the long run}} The Scarecrow of Oz {{would be one of the}} more popular installments in the Oz series.|$|R
2500|$|Winfrey {{selected}} {{a total of}} four of Morrison's novels over six years, giving Morrison's novels <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> sales <b>boost</b> than they got from her Nobel Prize win in 1993. The novelist also appeared three times on Winfrey's show. Winfrey said, [...] "For all those who asked the question 'Toni Morrison again?'… I say with certainty {{there would have been no}} Oprah's Book Club if this woman had not chosen to share her love of words with the world." [...] Morrison called the book club a [...] "reading revolution." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nelson became editor - in - {{chief of}} the trade {{magazine}} Publishers Weekly in January 2005. It was a powerful position since the magazine is traditionally regarded as a standard bearer for mainstream critical opinion regarding books. A positive review from Publishers Weekly can bring <b>a</b> <b>big</b> sales <b>boost</b> to <b>an</b> unknown title, and the editor - in - chief's opinion about new books has considerable weight in the publishing industry. New York Times reporter Edward Wyatt suggested that the top job at Publishers Weekly in 2005 involved facing [...] "many challenges".|$|R
2500|$|Later that year, Remington {{received}} {{a commission to}} do eighty-three illustrations for a book by Theodore Roosevelt, Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail, to be serialized in The Century Magazine before publication. The 29-year-old Roosevelt had a similar Western adventure to Remington, losing money on a ranch in North Dakota the previous year but gaining experience which made him an [...] "expert" [...] on the West. The assignment gave Remington's career <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> and forged a lifelong connection with Roosevelt.|$|E
2500|$|The {{creation}} of the International Yacht Racing Union and the International Rule in 1907 provided <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> to yacht building {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, and prior to World War I, the British yachting fleet had grown to around 3,900. [...] The emergence of a group of talented Clyde yacht designers such as William Fife III, George Lennox Watson, Alfred Mylne, James McGruer and David Boyd in the first half of the 20th century firmly established the pre-eminent position of Clyde yachts on the high seas. The River Clyde became, like Cowes and Kiel, a centre for yachting.|$|E

5000|$|Former President Bill Clinton {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} the state for the Clinton campaign saying on March 11 at an event in Western Pennsylvania that [...] "If she wins <b>a</b> <b>big,</b> big victory in Pennsylvania, I think it’ll give her <b>a</b> real <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> going into the next primaries... I think she’s got to win <b>a</b> <b>big</b> victory in Pennsylvania. I think if she does, she can be nominated, but it’s up to you." [...] This was a repetition of his tactic before March 4, warning supporters that his wife {{might not be able to}} continue if she did not win Ohio and Texas. Hillary Clinton emphasized that Pennsylvania was something of a home state for her, as her father came from Scranton, Pennsylvania, she and her brothers were christened there and had vacationed near there each summer, and her brothers still maintained the family cottage near there.|$|R
50|$|The victory {{turned out}} to be <b>a</b> <b>big</b> {{confidence}} <b>boost</b> for the athlete. After going to Ghana to help her country's relay team set a new national record of 43.28 on 8 July in Cape Coast, Marie-Josée Ta Lou flew to Formia, in Italy, for a series of European meets and her final preparation camp before the Olympic Games. Lined up in Monaco on 15 July, she false started after feeling one of her competitors move in the blocks. Three days later in Szekesfehervar in Hungary, she finished second behind Blessing Okagbare in a wind assisted 10.95 (+2.6m/s).|$|R
2500|$|In 1971, the James G. Blaine Society got <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> when Governor Tom McCall invited {{tourists}} to visit Oregon, but then added [...] "but for heaven's sake don't stay." [...] This public remark got national press coverage, {{and was even}} aired on the CBS Evening News. [...] The governor's remarks also created a demand for Oregon ungreeting cards, which were popular for many years. [...] The most famous ungreeting card read: [...] "Governor Tom Lawson McCall, {{on behalf of the}} citizens of the Great State of Oregon, cordially invites you to visit ...Washington, California, Idaho, Nevada, or Afghanistan…" [...] The sale of bumper stickers with phrases like [...] "Don't Californicate Oregon" [...] also became popular across the state in the 1970s. [...] The governor's [...] "come visit, but don't stay" [...] remark as well as the ungreeting cards and bumper stickers articulated the values of the James G. Blaine Society.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985 Dykstra, deemed {{ready for}} the major leagues, was {{promoted}} to the Mets when the team's starting center fielder, Mookie Wilson, {{was placed on the}} disabled list. The rookie's play and energy was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> to a Mets team that surged to a 98-win season and narrowly missed out on the NL East crown. The following season, Dykstra was first intended to be platooned in center field with Wilson, but when Mookie suffered a severe eye injury during spring training Dykstra took over the position as outright starter and leadoff hitter. Later that season, the Mets released left fielder George Foster and moved Wilson to left. Mets fans soon nicknamed Dykstra [...] "Nails" [...] for his hard-nosed personality and fearless play. In 1986, he even posed shirtless for a [...] "beefcake" [...] poster under the [...] "Nails" [...] nickname. Dykstra and #2 hitter Wally Backman were termed [...] "the Wild Boys" [...] for their scrappy play as spark plugs for the star-studded Met lineup.|$|E
2500|$|Dion {{organized}} and hosted the First International Conference on Federalism in Mont Tremblant in October 1999 to foster {{international support for}} the cause of federalism in Canada. Quebec sovereigntist leaders were granted a prominent role in the conference and used their floor time to denounce Canadian federalism to an international audience to the great annoyance of their federalist host. But Dion's views got <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> during the closing speech by United States President Bill Clinton. Clinton appeared to echo the Supreme Court Reference, warning that [...] "when a people thinks it should be independent {{in order to have a}} meaningful political existence, serious questions should be asked.... Are minority rights as well as majority rights respected? How are we going to co-operate with our neighbours?". Clinton argued that federalism allows peoples seeking recognition of their identity a way to do so without isolating themselves in a nation-state. The speech laid to rest any doubts about the U.S. position on the legality and desirability of unilateral secession in Quebec.|$|E
50|$|Famously Redmond campaigned in {{his army}} uniform {{and wearing a}} black armband.

Although he retained his seat {{in the general election}} of December that year, he did not take part in the First Dáil.|$|R
50|$|They {{made the}} playoffs as a {{wildcard}} and advanced against the Jaguars and Chiefs and defeated the Steelers in the 1997 AFC Championship Game. They then won Super Bowl XXXII against the Packers 31-24, only the second team since the NFL/AFL merger in 1970 to ever win a Super Bowl as a wildcard, and the first AFC team to win the title since the Los Angeles Raiders in Super Bowl XVIII following the 1983 season. The win was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> morale <b>boost</b> to Denver and the Broncos, who had suffered through four previous Super Bowl losses, and especially Elway, who had led three of those defeats.|$|R
5000|$|Rob Copsey from Official Charts Company called Ghost Town [...] "a triumphant return...the kind of {{song that}} {{forces you to}} sit up and take notice." [...] Lipshutz from Billboard commented that [...] "the track could use <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> energy <b>boost,</b> {{although}} the dark house beats suit Lambert well". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called it [...] "perhaps his best single to date... Lambert becomes a house diva, singing with precision and ambition but in service of the song." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy commented [...] "it's a mood perfect for Adam's balance of glam rock image, soulful vocal and today's house music-dominated landscape." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the US, Hot Pursuit {{was ranked}} number seven on NPD's sales charts for November 2010, outselling Sony's racing juggernaut Gran Turismo 5, which {{launched}} {{about a week}} later. On 10 December 2010 GamesIndustry reported that Hot Pursuit managed to sell 417,000 units in the US in just two weeks. Cowan and Company reported that despite the positive sales figures were not enough to pick up EA's year on year sales figures. The analytical firm stated that the year on year sales figures for November were still down 25 percent for EA. Gamertell stated that [...] "Hot Pursuits success is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> for a genre that has taken some hits in 2010, {{as well as a}} franchise that has been searching for its identity. After several 'reinventions', EA turned to Criterion Games, the studio famous for the Burnout series, to right this racer. Criterion took the series back to the high-octane formula of cops chasing racers. Unlike actual illegal street racers, Hot Pursuit fans seem happy to see the police." [...] Hot Pursuit was placed number ten on NPD's sales charts for December 2010 with sales of 906,000 units for the month.|$|E
2500|$|Now down 17-0, New York had a {{good chance}} {{to get back in the}} game when Mark Gastineau forced a fumble from Ferguson on the Bills next drive. Gastineau got to the ball before anyone else, but wound up accidentally {{knocking}} the ball forward twice while trying to pick it up, and Buffalo lineman Ken Jones ended up recovering it. Following a missed 37-yard field goal attempt by Mike-Mayer after the fumble recovery, Todd led the Jets to the Bills 38-yard line, only to throw another interception, this one to linebacker Phil Villapiano, who returned it 18 yards to the 40. The Bills converted this turnover into a 24-0 lead as Ferguson completed a 28-yard pass to running back Joe Cribbs before hooking up with Lewis for a 26-yard scoring completion. However, New York got <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> from receiver Kurt Sohn, who returned the kickoff 28 yards to the 48-yard line. [...] From there, Todd led the team 52 yards in five plays to score on his 30-yard touchdown pass to tight end Mickey Shuler, Shuler's first reception of the season. After a pair of punts, Jets linebacker Greg Buttle returned an interception from Ferguson 29 yards to the Bills 14-yard line, setting up's Leahy's 26-yard field goal that cut the score to 24-10 at the end of the half.|$|E

The Nür model featured an improved RB26DETT based on the N1 racing engine.
