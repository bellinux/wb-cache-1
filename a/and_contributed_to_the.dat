5|$|A Red Cross shelter at Seldon Park, Brunswick, Georgia, {{opened for}} two days {{following}} the storm to temporarily house those whose houses were flooded.

5|$|From the 5th to the mid-9th centuries {{the art of}} the Picts is {{primarily}} known through stone sculpture, and a smaller number of pieces of metalwork, often of very high quality.

5|$|In 1753 the French began {{expanding}} their military control into the Ohio Country, a territory already {{claimed by the}} British colonies of Virginia and Pennsylvania. These competing claims led to {{a war in the}} colonies called the French and Indian War (1754–62) <b>and</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> start of the global Seven Years' War (1756–63). By chance, Washington became involved in its beginning.|$|E

5|$|Set against this, the purges of the Red Army leadership, {{in which}} Molotov participated, {{weakened}} the Soviet Union's defence capacity <b>and</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military disasters of 1941 and 1942, which were mostly caused by unreadiness for war. The purges {{also led to}} the dismantling of privatised agriculture and its replacement by collectivised agriculture. This left a legacy of chronic agricultural inefficiencies and under-production which the Soviet regime never fully rectified.|$|E
5|$|The Normandy {{landings}} (codenamed Operation Neptune) {{were the}} landing operations on Tuesday, 6 June 1944 (termed D-Day) of the Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II.
