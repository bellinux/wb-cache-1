5|$|A: Rules at {{the time}} of the first three ceremonies allowed for a {{performer}} to receive a single nomination which could honor their work in more than one film. Greta Garbo and Norma Shearer were both nominated for two different roles in the same category. Current Academy rules forbid this from happening.

5|$|Compounding matters was {{the fact}} that the {{supposedly}} deceased actors had signed contracts with the production which ensured that they would not appear in any type of media, motion pictures, or commercials for one year following the film's release.

5|$|Physicians: There are {{multiple}} aspects <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>why,</b> financially, hospice care {{may be difficult}} to access. The first would relate to physician reluctance. As stated previously, when enrolled in hospice, the patient transitions from their primary insurance to having most of their care managed directly by the hospice. As hospices typically have a limited budget, expensive care may not be permitted by the hospice. Additionally, reimbursement for physician visits can be complicated and result in non-payment to physicians. Therefore, difficulty in authorizing expensive treatments and lack of payment for visits can be reasons for non-referral from a physician.|$|E
