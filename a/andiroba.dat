50|$|As of 2003 {{there was}} {{a low level of}} deforestation, largely due to the {{isolation}} of the forest from urban centers.As of 2006 there were 359 families with an estimated total of 2,154 people in the forest, living in 30 communities along the three main rivers.There were 124 families in 11 communities along the Tefé, 74 families in 8 communities along the Bauana and 171 families in 11 communities along the Curumitá de Baixo.The residents are mainly engaged in family farming, cultivating small fields of cassava to make flour.The surplus is marketed in the city of Tefé either directly or through middlemen.Other activities include artisan fishing and extraction of nuts, açaí, <b>andiroba,</b> copaiba and wood.|$|E
50|$|The Mura have {{traditionally}} used the park {{as a source}} of wood for their homes and boats, and of Brazil nuts, lianas, copaiba and <b>andiroba</b> oils, açaí, buriti, bacaba, patauá and honey.They have also used it for fishing, and have acted as guides for sports fishing tourists.Creation of the park has caused a drop by almost 50% of tourism revenue.There was no legal precedent in Brazil for allowing indigenous people to use the resources of a state park, but Colombia and Peru had defined relevant principles. To avoid ongoing conflicts and to recognise the conservation role of the Mura people, the management plan recognised the Indigenous Special Use Zone (ZUEI) in the park, basically consisting of land along the major rivers and streams upstream from the indigenous territory.|$|E

ResultsAndiroba oil and its limonoid-rich fraction inhibited the growth of W 2 clone in 100 %, between 24 and 72 h, at concentrations of 8. 2 μg/mL and 3. 1 μg/mL, respectively. Under the same conditions, the parasitaemia of Dd 2 clone provoked by the <b>andiroba</b> oil showed inhibition of 31 % (IC 50 > 82 μg/mL) with a time-dependent relationship of 24 h and inhibition of 88 % (IC 50 8. 4 μg/mL) after 72 h, while for the limonoid-rich fraction the inhibition of Dd 2 clone was 56 % (IC 50 2. 8 μg/mL) at 24 h and 82 % (IC 50 0. 4 μg/mL) after 72 h. <b>Andiroba</b> oil in acute toxicity test with a fixed dose (LD 50 > 2000 mg/kg) was not toxic The limonoids identified in the oil were gedunin, 6 α-acetoxygedunin, 7 -deacetoxy- 7 -oxogedunin, 7 -deacetylgedunin, 1, 2 -dihydro- 3 β-hydroxy- 7 -deacetoxy- 7 -oxogedunin and andirobin.

The aim of this work was therefore to investigate the hematotoxicity, genotoxicity and mutagenicity of <b>andiroba</b> oil using the comet and micronucleus assays, and to assess its antioxidant properties and lipidome {{as a means of}} addressing safety issues. For the experiments, <b>andiroba</b> oil was administered by gavage for 14 consecutive days in nulliparous female Swiss mice randomly distributed in four groups: negative control and three doses of oil (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day).

Do extrato hexânico do pericarpo da mesma espécie foram isolados os limonoides angolensato de metila e 6 -hidroxi-angolensato de metila (inédito na espécie). Para fins de comparação, um método foi desenvolvido em CLAE/DAD para quantificar os limonoides isolados nas amostras de extratos obtidos das diferentes partes dos frutos das duas espécies. Duas amostras comerciais de óleo de <b>andiroba</b> produzidos de forma tradicional também foram analisadas. O resultado das análises nas amostras dos extratos obtidos das duas espécies indica o acúmulo de quase todos os limonoides isolados no óleo das amêndoas e que o limonoide 7 -desacetilgedunina pode ser utilizado como marcador químico para a diferenciação entre as espécies. A análise das amostras dos óleos de <b>andiroba</b> tradicionais comercializados pelo método desenvolvido em CLAE/DAD mostrou diferenças em termos de concentrações dos limonoides analisados.

A soroterapia neutraliza os efeitos sistêmicos do veneno, mas não os efeitos locais; portanto, são necessárias pesquisas sobre inibidores naturais dos efeitos locais do envenenamento. A <b>andiroba</b> (Carapa guianensis Aublet, 1775) é uma planta de florestas tropicais e equatoriais, cujas sementes fornecem um óleo com propriedades medicinais, com atividades antiinflamatória, cicatrizante e anti-séptica, além de ser um ótimo repelente. Com o objetivo de avaliar a atividade do óleo de <b>andiroba</b> na inflamação local induzida por venenos de serpentes amazônicas, foram estudados experimentalmente os efeitos farmacológicos gerais do óleo de <b>andiroba</b> e sua atividade sobre o processo inflamatório local, induzido em camundongos pelos venenos de serpentes Bothrops atrox ou Crotalus durissus ruruima, serpentes de importância epidemiológica na região da Amazônia. A cinética inibitória do edema em camundongos foi avaliada pela medição do diâmetro do edema das patas dos camundongos e por métodos histopatológicos. Após o tratamento com o óleo de <b>andiroba,</b> obteve-se uma inibição significativa no infiltrado inflamatório de 87, 03 % e 82, 10 %, às 3 e 12 horas respectivamente, nas patas experimentais induzidas com o veneno de Bothrops atrox. Com o veneno de Crotalus durissus ruruima a inibição atingiu 89, 37 % e 75, 60 %, às 3 e 6 horas, respectivamente, pós-tratamento. Quanto ao edema avaliado pela medição do diâmetro das patas dos camundongos, foi observada uma diminuição significativa em 37, 67 % no edema induzido pelo veneno de Bothrops atrox e em 42, 41 % no edema induzido pelo veneno de Crotalus durissus ruruima, a partir da primeira hora após a administração desses venenos nos grupos tratados com o óleo de <b>andiroba.</b> A redução dos edemas progrediu até 50, 64 % (para Bothrops atrox) e 82, 37 % (para Crotalus durissus ruruima) às 3 horas pós-tratamento.

With the objective of evaluating {{the activity of the}} <b>andiroba</b> oil on the local inflammation induced by Amazonian snakes, an experimental study was done on the general pharmacological effects of the <b>andiroba</b> oil and on the inflammatory process induced in mice by the venoms of Bothrops atrox and Crotalus durissus ruruima, two snakes species of epidemiological importance in the Amazon region. The inhibitory kinetics of the edema in mice was evaluated by measuring the paw edema diameter and by histopathological methods. There was a significant inhibition in the inflammatory infiltrate of 87, 03 % and 82, 10 % after 3 and 12 hours respectively, after treating with <b>andiroba</b> oil the paws induced with the venom of Bothrops atrox. With the venom of Crotalus durissus ruruima inhibition reached 89, 37 % and 75, 60 % after 3 and 6 hours respectively, after treatment with <b>andiroba</b> oil. There was significant reduction in the kinetics of the edema induced by the venom of Bothrops atrox (37, 67 %) and of Crotalus durissus ruruima (42, 41 %) as early as the first hour of treatment with <b>andiroba</b> oil. This reduction progressed to 50, 64 % (for Bothrops atrox) and 82, 37 % (Crotalus durissus ruruima) after three hours after treatment. Histologically, it was observed a reduction of the edema induced by Bothrops atrox venom by 29, 18 % after 3 hours. With the venom of Crotalus durissus ruruima the reduction of the edema was 30, 87 % after 3 hours. Neither haemorrhagy nor myonecrosis were reduced or inhibited by <b>andiroba</b> oil administrated intraperitoneally. It is suggested that the inhibitory activity of Carapa guianensis could be related to leucocitary migration reductio...|$|E
