5|$|Throughout {{its history}} Goofus and Gallant has been {{interpreted}} as an effective didactic comic. It {{has been used in}} several studies as a stimulus to prompt children to identify kind and unkind actions, and the characters of Goofus and Gallant, <b>as</b> <b>archetypes</b> of badness and goodness, have been referenced in several works by philosophers.|$|E
5|$|The {{concepts}} of Goofus and Gallant have {{also appeared in}} contexts divorced from the comic. Philosopher Theodore Sider used the characters in an argument against {{the notion of a}} binary Heaven or Hell conception of the afterlife. Sider conceived of Goofus and Gallant as near-equals, with Gallant only marginally better than Goofus, in arguing that sending the former to Heaven and the latter to Hell is antithetical to God's justice. Other philosophers such as Matthew Konieczka and Casey Swank have also called upon Goofus and Gallant <b>as</b> <b>archetypes</b> of bad and good when formulating arguments.|$|E
25|$|According to Martin Kramer, the Quran {{speaks of}} Jews in a {{negative}} way and reports instances of Jewish treachery against the Islamic prophet Muhammad. However, Islam didn't hold up those Jews who practiced treachery against Muhammad <b>as</b> <b>archetypes</b> nor did it portray treachery as the embodiment of Jews in all times and places. The Quran also attests to Muhammad's amicable relations with Jews.|$|E

25|$|For {{thousands}} of years, male homosexuality {{was referred to}} in literature by alluding to two semi-legendary figures from the early Zhou Dynasty. The first was Mizi Xia and the half-eaten peach which he shared with his lover, the actual historical figure, Duke Ling of Wei. The second was Lord Long Yang, who convinced an unnamed King of Wei to remain faithful to him by comparing himself to a small fish which the King might throw back if a larger fish came along. While both Mizi Xia and Lord Long Yang may have actually existed, nothing is known about them beyond their defining stories, and their presence in Chinese literature was very much that of legendary characters who served <b>as</b> <b>archetypes</b> of homosexual love.|$|E
500|$|In the Church's mythology, Jehovah1 had {{intended}} for Dobbs {{to lead a}} powerful conspiracy and brainwash individuals to make them work for a living. Dobbs refused to support the group; instead, he infiltrated it and organized a counter-movement. Church leaders teach {{that he was a}} very intelligent child and, as he grew older, studied several religious traditions, including Sufism, Rosicrucianism, and the Fourth Way. Another key event in his life occurred when he traveled to Tibet; there he learned vital truths about topics including Yetis. The Church teaches that Yetis exist, and that SubGenius members have descended from them. The only relative of Dobbs that the Church identifies is his mother, Jane McBride Dobbs—Church leaders cite his lack of resemblance to his mother's husband as the reason for not revealing his father. Dobbs is married to a woman named Connie; SubGenius leaders identify the couple <b>as</b> <b>archetypes</b> of the genders in a belief that resembles Hindu doctrines about Shiva and Parvati. Church literature has variously described Dobbs' occupation as [...] "drilling equipment" [...] or fluoride sales, and accounts of his life generally emphasize his good fortune rather than intelligence. SubGenius leaders believe that he is capable of time travel, and that this ability results in occasional changes to doctrine, deemed the [...] "Sacred Doctrine of Erasability" [...] by the Church. Consequently, members attempt to follow Dobbs by eschewing unchangeable plans.|$|E
2500|$|Sheldrake {{has also}} noted {{similarities}} between morphic resonance and Carl Jung's collective unconscious, {{with regard to}} collective memories being shared across individuals and the coalescing of particular behaviours through repetition, described by Jung <b>as</b> <b>archetypes.</b> However, whereas Jung assumed that archetypal forms were transmitted through physical inheritance, Sheldrake attributes collective memories to morphic resonance, and rejects any explanation of them involving what he terms [...] "mechanistic biology".|$|E

2500|$|In various {{editions of}} On the Natural Variety of Mankind, Blumenbach {{expanded}} on Meiners' popular idea and defined five human races based on color, using popular racial {{terms of his}} day, justified with scientific terminology, cranial measurements, and facial features. He established Caucasian as the [...] "white race", Mongoloid as the [...] "yellow race", Malayan as the [...] "brown race", Ethiopian as the [...] "black race", and American as the [...] "red race". In the 3rd edition of his On the Natural Variety of Mankind, Blumenbach moved skin tone to second-tier importance after noticing that poorer European people (such as peasants) whom he observed generally worked outside, often became darker skinned ("browner") through sun exposure. He also noticed that darker skin of an [...] "olive-tinge" [...] was a natural feature of some European populations closer to the Mediterranean Sea. Alongside the anthropologist Georges Cuvier, Blumenbach classified the Caucasian race by cranial measurements and bone morphology in addition to skin pigmentation, and thus considered {{more than just the}} palest Europeans ("white, cheeks rosy") <b>as</b> <b>archetypes</b> for the Caucasian race.|$|E

They leased the inn where they were joined by Oakley's mother, Green's parents, and Henrietta Cozens, who managed the gardens and inn.

3000|$|Machine {{perception}} {{deals with}} designing machines that can sense and interpret their environment. For restricted and well-known environments, {{they can be}} already achieved, quite promising results. However, the situation changes when shifting to the so-called real-world environments with a seemingly infinite number of possible occurring objects, events, and situations. The problems that scientists are currently confronted with here show that this research area {{is still in its}} infancy [43]. In contrast, it is well accepted that humans are equipped with a preceptory system that enables them to apprehend their environment within reasonable time and accuracy [10]. This inspired several research groups to use biology <b>as</b> <b>archetype</b> for perceptual model development [44]. Success of most existing approaches, however, has been limited so far. One reason might be that in many cases, engineers just [...] "grab" [...] some fancy sounding terms and concepts from biology for model development without considering the overall functioning of the biological system taken <b>as</b> <b>archetype</b> [17]. In contrast to this, one quite promising approach to human-like machine perception, which actually sticks to neuroscientific and neuropsychological research findings about the structural organization and function of the perceptual system of the human brain, was made by the work in [45]. The basic idea of this approach will briefly be sketched in the following.|$|R
