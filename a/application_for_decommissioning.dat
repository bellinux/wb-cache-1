50|$|Two {{weeks later}} the DB started a closure {{process for the}} line. It sought to abandon the {{passenger}} service between Ebersberg and Wasserburg town {{as well as the}} infrastructure of the Ebersberg-Forsting and the Wasserburg station-Wasserburg town sections. The <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>decommissioning</b> was approved by the DB Management Board on 19 December 1988.|$|E
50|$|The Federal Ministry of Transport {{rejected}} DB’s <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>decommissioning</b> on 23 February 1994. This was justified, inter alia, by {{the interest}} of third parties in taking over the line and its operations. TAG Tegernsee Immobilien und Beteiligung had offered several times since 1989, under certain conditions—including investment in the track and rolling stock amounting to about 40 million marks—to take over responsibility for the line.|$|E
40|$|Up to 11 kW of CW {{laser power}} at a {{wavelength}} of 1. 3 µm {{has been successfully}} coupled into a 20 meter long optical fiber. The present experiment aimed at the evaluation of COIL <b>application</b> <b>for</b> the <b>decommissioning</b> of nuclear installations was performed using the existing COIL facility at the DLR Lampoldshausen site. This facility is briefly {{described in terms of}} its main components and operating parameters. A customer designed optical system by the HighYag company is presented: it enables the propper coupling of the 1. 3 µm radiation into a 1000 µm fiber and the appropriate delivery of the laser beam onto the workpiece. The transmission losses of the COIL radiation range between 15 and 20 % as deduced from online measurements. Cutting examples in stainless steel, concrete, and other materials are given and discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAbrasive {{water jet}} {{has been used}} for more than thirty years. It quickly became one of the core non-conventional {{technologies}} for cutting operations of various materials, ranging from soft and easy to cut materials, through ductile metal materials to brittle, hard to cut ceramics and metals. Abrasive water suspension jet (AWSJ) did not gain much popularity in machining industry in the beginning as opposed to abrasive water injection jet, but has found niche applications where its advantages were put to use. In this study a review of recent development in the eld of AWSJ is presented. Micro-machining, as a potential <b>application</b> <b>for</b> AWSJ, is discussed at the beginning, followed by several advances in the AWSJ technology. At the end, typical <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> AWSJ as <b>decommissioning</b> and dismantling of structures or rock drilling are presented...|$|R
30|$|In the {{building}} industry, 4 D building information modeling (BIM) {{has been used}} to simulate the construction or demolition plan. Using 4 D BIM, different plans can be compared by visualizing the work sequences and duration of each task. Unreasonable logic in the sequence and task duration can be detected by professional project managers and engineers. Previous efforts have studied the application of 4 D BIM for the monitoring of construction operations (Han & Golparvar-Fard 2015), for reconstruction (Kacprzyk & Kępa 2014), for construction progress measurement (Hu et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2013), for workspace conflict visualization (Moon et al. 2014) and for safety analysis (Hu et al. 2008; Zhou et al. 2013). However, 4 D BIM <b>application</b> <b>for</b> OOGP <b>decommissioning</b> is understudied. The advantages of 4 D BIM have been shown from {{the building}} industry, almost no studies talked about 4 D BIM application in OOGP decommissioning. The differences in 4 D BIM application between OOGP decommissioning and the building industry may be the reason. For example, the components and structures are different in the two industries, and multi-trucks can be used in building industry to carry the removed elements, while only one heavy lift vessel is usually used during OOGP decommissioning, requiring carefully planning.|$|R
50|$|On July 12, 2006 it was {{announced}} that the plant would be sold to Entergy. On April 11, 2007, the plant was sold to Entergy for $380 million. The plant's original licensee was due to expire on March 24, 2011. An <b>application</b> <b>for</b> 20-year extension was filed in 2005 with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{complications}} {{in terms of}} uncertainty and calculations provisions {{for oil and gas}} decommissioning costs are not easy to be understood and interpret by users of no accounting and finance background. Furthermore, due to their significant sizes, cash outflow effect and importance for decision making disclosing more detailed information seem to be ideal requirement to simplify these complications. This study raises, almost for the first time, queries about compliance, sufficiency, uniformity and fairness of oil and gas companies' disclosure practices with regard to provisions <b>for</b> <b>decommissioning</b> costs. In order to provide answers to the research quires, annual reports of 69 oil and gas companies listed in the UK were analysed and thirteen interviews with different professionals were conducted. Our results reveal that whilst there is sufficient standards to regulate accounting <b>for</b> provisions <b>for</b> <b>decommissioning</b> costs there seems to be lack of compliance with requirements of international accounting standards in terms of disclosing information on provisions <b>for</b> <b>decommissioning</b> costs. In many cases, and probably due to their sensitive nature, we found that oil and gas companies tend to disclose a minimum amount of information about provisions <b>for</b> <b>decommissioning</b> costs...|$|R
