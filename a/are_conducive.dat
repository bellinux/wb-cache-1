5|$|The {{history of}} the Auxois is closely tied to its homeland, {{for which it is}} named. The rich {{pastures}} of the Auxois area, including the French Gold Coast, parts of Yonne, the Saône-et-Loire and northern Nièvre, <b>are</b> <b>conducive</b> to the breeding of large draft horses. The recognition of the Auxois dates back to the early 20th century, making it relatively new compared to other French draft breeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{geography}} of mountain ranges bordering the Mediterranean <b>are</b> <b>conducive</b> for severe weather and thunderstorms, with the sloped nature of mountainous regions permitting {{the development of}} convective activity. Although the {{geography of}} the Mediterranean region, {{as well as its}} dry air, typically prevent the formation of tropical cyclones, when certain meteorological circumstances arise, difficulties influenced by the region's geography are overcome. The occurrence of tropical cyclones in the Mediterranean Sea is generally extremely rare, with an average of 1.57forming annually and merely 99recorded occurrences of tropical-like storms discovered between 1948 and 2011 in a modern study, with no definitive trend in activity in that period. Few medicanes form during the summer season, though activity typically rises in autumn, peaks in January, and gradually decreases from February to May. In the western Mediterranean region of development, approximately 0.75such systems form each year, compared to 0.32in the Ionian Sea region.|$|E

25|$|Wines {{produced}} {{in the region of}} Barsac, such as Premiers Crus Château Climens and Château Coutet are allowed to be labeled either with the commune name or with Sauternes. The intense sweetness {{is the result of the}} grapes being affected by Botrytis cinerea, a fungus that is commonly known as noble rot. In the autumn, the Ciron river produces mist that descends upon the area and persists until after dawn. These conditions <b>are</b> <b>conducive</b> to the growth of the fungus which desiccates the grape and concentrates the sugars inside. The three main grapes of this area are Sémillon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle.|$|E
25|$|Christmas Island, due to {{its close}} {{proximity}} to Australia's northern neighbours, falls within many of the satellite footprints throughout the region.

John Patchett established the Napa Valley's first commercial vineyard in 1858. In 1861 Charles Krug established another of Napa Valley's first commercial wineries in St. Helena.

The wine industry in Napa Valley recovered, and helped {{by the results of}} the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, came to be seen as capable of producing the best quality wine – equal to that of Old World wine regions. Napa Valley is now a major enotourism destination.|$|E
25|$|Cycling in Melbourne is {{a popular}} pastime, as one {{can tell from the}} bevy of cyclists and paths that lie all {{throughout}} the city, as well as a spectator sport. Melbourne's flat terrain and extensive off-road paths in green wedges <b>are</b> <b>conducive</b> to riding. Beach Road combines with the Nepean Highway to form a 90-kilometre stretch from Port Melbourne to Sorrento, incorporating the Bayside Trail. It is the city's most popular training route and attracts cyclists from around the world. Thousands of commuters cycle the roads, bike lanes and bike paths daily. Bicycle Victoria's annual events, Around the Bay in a Day and Ride to Work Day, attract tens of thousands of Melburnians. Other events such as the Herald Sun Tour begin and end in the Melbourne area and there are many local cycling events of varying grades all year round.|$|E
25|$|Most modern {{dairy farms}} divide the animals into {{different}} management units {{depending on their}} age, nutritional needs, reproductive status, and milk production status. The group of cows that are currently lactating, the milking herd, is often managed most intensively {{to make sure their}} diet and environmental conditions <b>are</b> <b>conducive</b> to producing as much high quality milk as possible. On some farms the milking herd is further divided into milking strings, which are groups of animals with different nutritional needs. The segment of the adult herd that are in the resting period before giving birth to their next calf are called dry cows because they are not being milked. All female animals that have yet to give birth to their first calf are called heifers. They will grow up {{to take the place of}} older animals in the milking herd and thus are sometimes generally referred to as the replacement herd.|$|E

25|$|When {{conditions}} <b>are</b> <b>conducive</b> to stomatal opening (e.g., high {{light intensity}} and high humidity), a proton pump drives protons (H+) from the guard cells. This {{means that the}} cells' electrical potential becomes increasingly negative. The negative potential opens potassium voltage-gated channels and so an uptake of potassium ions (K+) occurs. To maintain this internal negative voltage so that entry of potassium ions does not stop, negative ions balance the influx of potassium. In some cases, chloride ions enter, while in other plants the organic ion malate is produced in guard cells. This increase in solute concentration lowers the water potential inside the cell, which results in the diffusion of water into the cell through osmosis. This increases the cell's volume and turgor pressure. Then, because of rings of cellulose microfibrils that prevent {{the width of the}} guard cells from swelling, and thus only allow the extra turgor pressure to elongate the guard cells, whose ends are held firmly in place by surrounding epidermal cells, the two guard cells lengthen by bowing apart from one another, creating an open pore through which gas can move.|$|E
