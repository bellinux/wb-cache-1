5|$|In Serbia, the {{government}} was again favourable towards the Bulgarian revolutionaries' <b>aspirations</b> <b>and</b> allowed them to establish in Belgrade the Second Bulgarian Legion, an organisation similar to its predecessor and its goals. Levski was a prominent member of the Legion, but between February and April 1868 he suffered from a gastric condition that required surgery. Bedridden, he could {{not participate in the}} Legion's training. After the Legion was again disbanded under political pressure, Levski attempted to reunite with his compatriots, but was arrested in Zaječar and briefly imprisoned. Upon his release he went to Romania, where Hadzhi Dimitar and Stefan Karadzha were mobilising revolutionary detachments. For various reasons, including his stomach problems and strategic differences, Levski did not participate. In the winter of 1868, he became acquainted with poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev and lived with him in an abandoned windmill near Bucharest.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} music of South India {{is known as}} Carnatic music, which includes rhythmic and structured music by composers like Purandara Dasa, Kanaka Dasa, Tyagayya, Annamacharya, Bhakta Ramadasu, Muthuswami Dikshitar, Shyama Shastri, Kshetrayya, Mysore Vasudevachar and Swathi Thirunal. The main instrument that is used in South Indian Hindu temples is the nadaswaram, a reed instrument played along with thavil, a type of drum instrument to create an ensemble. The motion picture industry has emerged as an important platform in South India over the years, portraying the cultural changes, trends, <b>aspirations</b> <b>and</b> developments experienced by its people. South India is home to several distinct dance forms such as Bharatanatyam, Kathakali, Kerala Natanam, Koodiyattam, Kuchipudi, Margamkali, Mohiniaattam, Oppana, Ottamthullal, Theyyam, Vilasini Natyam and Yakshagana. The dance, clothing and sculptures of South India exemplify {{the beauty of the}} body and motherhood.|$|E
5|$|Destiny's Child {{went to a}} hiatus, {{following}} the release of their third studio album Survivor (2001), allowing {{each member of the}} group to release solo material. As each member had success with their individual projects, questions arose by the public whether they would record again as a group. However, group members Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams reunited again to work on their fourth studio album Destiny Fulfilled. The album was released in late 2004 and the group further embarked on a worldwide tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It the following year as part of its promotion. During a concert the group had at the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona, Spain on June 11, 2005, Rowland announced to the audience that the tour would be Destiny's Child last together, revealing their formal disbandment. It was announced that after their final North American leg, the group would part ways, with each member continuing their music career as a solo act. During an interview, they explained that their disbandment was planned during the making of Destiny Fulfilled as they discussed their individual <b>aspirations</b> <b>and</b> realized that remaining as a group would prevent them in pursuing those interests. However, it was acknowledged that the album would not be their last album together.|$|E

5|$|The Scottish {{education}} system underwent radical change and {{expansion in the}} 20th century. In 1918 Roman Catholic schools were brought into the system, but retained their distinct religious character, access to schools by priests and the requirement that school staff be acceptable to the Church. The school leaving age was raised to 14 in 1901, and although plans to raise it to 15 in the 1940s were never ratified, increasing numbers stayed on beyond elementary education and it was eventually raised to 16 in 1973. As a result, secondary education was the major area {{of growth in the}} inter-war period, particularly for girls, who stayed on in full-time education in increasing numbers throughout the century. New qualifications were developed to cope with changing <b>aspirations</b> <b>and</b> economics, with the Leaving Certificate being replaced by the Scottish Certificate of Education Ordinary Grade ('O-Grade') and Higher Grade ('Higher') qualifications in 1962, which became the basic entry qualification for university study. The centre of the {{education system}} also became more focused on Scotland, with the ministry of education partly moving north in 1918 and then finally having its headquarters relocated to Edinburgh in 1939. After devolution, in 1999 the new Scottish Executive set up an Education Department and an Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department, which together took over its functions. One of the major diversions from practice in England, possible because of devolution, was the abolition of student tuition fees in 1999, instead retaining a system of means-tested student grants.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{the need}} for new leadership, in {{what became known as the}} Polish October, the Politburo chose Gomułka, who had been {{released}} from prison and reinstated in the party, and the Central Committee's 8th Plenum elected him without a Soviet approval the new first secretary of the PZPR. Subsequently, Gomułka convinced the Soviet leaders that he would preserve the Soviet influence in Poland. Gomułka's elevation was preceded by ominous Soviet military moves and an arrival of Soviet high-level delegation led by Khrushchev, which flew into Warsaw to witness and influence the upheaval in the Polish party. After the sometimes confrontational encounters and negotiations, they soon returned to Moscow, where the Soviet leader announced on 21 October that the idea of an armed intervention in Poland should be abandoned. This position was soon reinforced by the pressure from communist China, which expressed its great power <b>aspirations</b> <b>and</b> demanded that the Soviets leave the new Polish leadership alone. On 21 October in Warsaw Gomułka's return to power was accomplished, giving rise to the era of national communism in Poland. Gomułka pledged to dismantle Stalinism and in his acceptance speech raised numerous social democratic-sounding reformist ideas, giving hope to the left-wing revisionists and others in Polish society that the communist state was, after all, reformable. The revisionists replaced and claimed to represent the worker movement, recently defeated in Poznań. The main goals in pursuit of which they engaged were political freedom and self-management in state enterprises. However, the end of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe was nowhere in sight. On 14 May 1955, the Warsaw Pact was signed in the Polish capital, to counteract the earlier establishment of NATO.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Foreign body <b>aspiration</b> <b>and</b> {{ingestion}} {{foreign body}} is usually seen in childhood but can occur at any age. When {{the diagnosis of}} foreign bodies are delayed, this may lead important complications. Complet or partial obstruction of the main bronchial system produces different findings. Death may occur if emergency treatment is not given. The nine interesting foreign body <b>aspiration</b> <b>and</b> ingestion cases in our clinic were evaluated. Material and Method: In our study, 9 foreign bodys <b>aspiration</b> <b>and</b> ingestion cases were treated with interesting clinical and radiological findings were reviewed for the last 1. 5 years. The distribution of age of the patients ranged from 9 months- 54 years. 5 male patients, 4 were female. The period between <b>aspiration</b> <b>and</b> ingestion and treatment varied from 1. 5 hour and 20 years. Results: All patients underwent broncoscopy or esophagoscopy. In five cases broncoscopy or esophagoscopy were insufficient and thoracotomy or VATS was performed. In all cases, foreign bodies were removed. Mortality was not observed. Discussion: The definite diagnosis of foreign body <b>aspiration</b> <b>and</b> ingestion is confirmed by esophagoscopy or broncoscopy. History, physical examination and radyological findings {{is very important for}} diagnosis of foreign body aspiration. Othervise, the morbidity and mortality may be unavoidable...|$|R

JHWGA provided an intensive week of activities in career planning, self-concept improvement, and study skills. Specific research questions were: a) did participation in this program increase career readiness, self-concept, productive study habits, <b>aspiration,</b> <b>and</b> motivation to prepare for college? b) what {{percent of the variance}} in <b>aspiration</b> to <b>and</b> motivation for college in early adolescents could be explained by career readiness, self-esteem, and study habits? Using survey research, a questionnaire was developed with five scales (career readiness, self-esteem, study habits, <b>aspiration,</b> <b>and</b> motivation). Questionnaires were sent to 301 West Virginia students in Grade 8 who had been JHWGA applicants in 1996. The 265 (88 %) who responded were divided into two groups: a participant group consisting of 104 students who participated in the 1996 program and a comparison group consisting of 161 students who did not attend the 1996 program.
