5|$|Electrons inside {{conducting}} solids, {{which are}} quasi-particles themselves, when tightly confined at temperatures close to absolute zero, behave <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they had split into three other quasiparticles: spinons, orbitons and holons.

50|$|Hypothesized {{treatment}} options {{include the use}} of antioxidants, cognitive behavior therapy, erythropoietin and stimulant drugs such <b>as</b> methylphenidate, <b>though</b> <b>as</b> the mechanism of PCCI is not well understood the potential {{treatment options}} are equally theoretical.|$|R
5|$|Mrs. Tittlemouse {{is a tale}} {{in which}} no humans play a part and one in which events are treated <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they have {{occurred}} since time immemorial and far from human observance. It is a simple story, and one likely to appeal to young children.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear wheel}} is {{prevented}} from precessing {{as the front}} wheel does by friction of the tires on the ground, and so continues to lean <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were not spinning at all. Hence gyroscopic forces do not provide any resistance to tipping.|$|E
5|$|According to Hossein Nasr, the {{earliest}} European literature often refers to Muhammad unfavorably. A few learned circles of Middle Ages Europeprimarily Latin-literate scholarshad access to fairly extensive biographical material about Muhammad. They interpreted the biography through a Christian religious filter; one that viewed Muhammad {{as a person}} who seduced the Saracens into his submission under religious guise. Popular European literature of the time portrayed Muhammad <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he were worshipped by Muslims, similar to an idol or a heathen god.|$|E

5|$|At about 2:00p.m., the American {{military}} authorities, who {{had arrived}} in the city, ordered that the bodies be taken down and delivered to the city morgue for autopsies to be carried out. A US army cameraman took photographs of the bodies for publication, including one with Mussolini and Petacci positioned in a macabre pose <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they were arm-in-arm.|$|E

5|$|During the pre-dawn {{coup and}} {{throughout}} the day, there was little reaction by the public who went about their daily life <b>as</b> <b>though</b> nothing had happened. Many appeared unaware that a coup had occurred {{while they were still}} sleeping. There was no disruption to road traffic or the media, and although flights were halted in the morning, they resumed in the afternoon. There were plans to enact a curfew but this was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Fertility {{control is}} a {{non-lethal}} method of population management that is usually viewed as the most humane treatment, and its use {{is supported by the}} RSPCA. While it appears <b>as</b> <b>though</b> these treatments are effective in the breeding season immediately following injection, the lasting effects are debated. Because it is costly and difficult to treat animals repeatedly, this method, despite being ideal, is not widely implemented.|$|E
5|$|Gallium-67 salts such as gallium citrate and gallium nitrate {{are used}} as {{radiopharmaceutical}} agents in the nuclear medicine imaging known as gallium scan. The radioactive isotope 67Ga is used, and the compound or salt of gallium is unimportant. The body handles Ga3+ in many ways <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were Fe3+, and the ion is bound (and concentrates) in areas of inflammation, such as infection, and in areas of rapid cell division. This allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 the Belgian, Romain Maes, {{appeared}} to win but judges declared Frenchman Georges Speicher the winner and Maes second. Shouting {{began in the}} stands {{and for a moment}} it looked <b>as</b> <b>though</b> fighting would start, but calm returned and the result was upheld. A Belgian may not have won but there were seven Belgians in the first ten.|$|E

While Damiano Cunego had broken away from the field with 15 kilometers left to race to win the event, Brajkovič won a sprint over 's Rigoberto Urán for second, and reacted <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he won the race. Chris Horner was also highly placed in the event, finishing seventh.|$|E

Though many designs for a miniaturised type B connector appeared on many peripheral devices, conformance to the USB 1.x standard was fudged by treating peripherals that had miniature connectors <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they had a tethered connection (that is: no plug or socket at the peripheral end). There was no known miniature type A connector until USB 2.0 (rev 1.01) introduced one.|$|E
