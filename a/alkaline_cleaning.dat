Once extracted from the wood these components have to be separated and purified from co-extracted compounds. Membrane filtration can be used to achieve this separation and is believed {{to play an important role}} in biorefineries. Fouling is the single greatest obstacle to the introduction of membrane processes in biorefineries. Fouling affects membrane performance in several ways: it reduces flux, alters separation properties and necessitates frequent cleaning which shortens membrane life-time. Cleaning, used to recover flux, needs to be optimized in order to reduce downtime costs. As a rule of thumb, <b>alkaline</b> <b>cleaning</b> agents are used to remove organic matter and acid cleaning agents are used to remove inorganic scalants. The complex nature of process streams in biorefineries complicates the choice of cleaning agents in these applications. Lignin, extractives, polysaccharides and inorganics are all potential foulants. This work illustrates the importance of choosing the right cleaning agent, and the right sequence of cleaning agents when multistep cleaning is used. A combination of microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) was used to isolate hemicelluloses in thermomechanical pulp (TMP) mill process water. Suspended and colloidal matter was removed in the MF stage and hemicelluloses were concentrated and purified in the UF stage.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this dissertation, copper {{bimetallic}} corrosion and its inhibition in cleaning processes involved in interconnect fabrication is explored. In microelectronics fabrication, post chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) cleaning is required to remove organic contaminants and particles left on copper interconnects after the CMP process.

In this study, different azole compounds are explored and pyrazole is found out to be a potentially superior Cu corrosion inhibitor, compared to the most widely used benzotriazole (BTA), for tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) -based post CMP cleaning solutions at pH 14.

In the second part, a novel technique built in-house called multiple internal Reflection Infrared Spectroscopy (MIR-IR) was explored as a characterization tool for characterization of different low-k structures. In leading edge integrated circuit manufacturing, reduction of RC time delay by incorporation of porous ultra low-k interlayer dielectrics into Cu interconnect nanostructure continues to pose major integration challenges. The main challenge is that porous structure renders interlayer dielectrics mechanically weak, chemically unstable and more susceptible to the RIE plasma etching damages. Besides the challenge of handling weak porous ultra low-k materials, a lack of sensitive metrology to guide systematic development of plasma etching, restoration and cleaning processes is the major stumbling block. We explored Multiple Internal Reflection Infrared Spectroscopy and associated IR techniques as a sensitive (sub- 5 nm) characterization tool to investigate chemical bonding modification across fluorocarbon etch residues and low-k dielectric interface after plasma etching, ashing, UV curing and post-etch cleaning. The new insights on chemical bonding transformation mapping can effectively guide the development of clean-friendly plasma etch for creating ultra low-k dielectric nanostructures with minimal dielectric damages...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{understand}} and analyse the issues of grey water generation and disposal in peri-urban areas of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and to propose a suitable solution to which includes designing a treatment system for grey water (water from shower, washing and kitchen). The purification will eliminate the sanitation issues that are brought by exposing untreated grey water to the environment as well save freshwater. This will be implemented with regard to local conditions in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Water-borne and vector-borne diseases are mainly brought by untreated grey water, which sadly enough causes thousands of death cases every year in Tanzania. The year between 2004 - 2005, 154551 cases of dysentery were reported with 170 deaths. It was also reported, 863488 cases of typhoid with 1167 deaths and {{last but not least}} 12923 cases of cholera from with 350 deaths. Deaths that were caused by diarrhoea were also reported, whereby, 90 % of them are children. According to the interviews that were conducted, people would not want to recycle the grey water for example for washing due to socio-cultural context where water is considered dirty even after treatment. They had difficulties in believing that the same dirty grey water can be purified and reused again for various domestic activities. The conducted characterisation of grey water showed the tested grey water has relatively high levels of BOD, basic pH, higher than average values of TSS, relatively low levels of DO, increased salinity and average level of FC. The analyses were performed on the most polluted grey water from every source. The volume of household produced grey water varies strongly, depending on socio-economic situation of the household and type of access to water supply. From estimation, the volume varies approximately between 60 - 160 l/day and household for a low income household. Living wall was proposed as grey water treatment system, because of its suitability to the peri-urban settlement and tropical climate. The system consists of concrete boxes placed over each other, filled with inner porous material and planted with plants. The system purifies grey water as it percolates through it {{and at the same time}} provides a vertical space for growing plants. The plants for the treatment system were chosen to Typha latifolia and Scirpus species. The plants are growing in Tanzania and are being used for wastewater treatment purposes. The plants are tolerant to increased salinity and can grow in <b>alkaline</b> soil. The <b>cleaning</b> effectiveness of the system was not tested, but only roughly estimated with help of values from a similar treatment system build in Gotland, Sweden. Hence, the reuse of grey water in this geographical location suits best for irrigation in rural and peri-urban areas with potential for agriculture as well as groundwater recharge in the peri-urban and urban areas. Recharging groundwater with treated grey water has a potential to be observed as an indirect and long term reuse of the water as it reconnects in the hydrological cycle...|$|R
40|$|Over the years, megasonic {{energy has}} been widely used in the {{semiconductor}} industry for effective particle removal from surfaces after chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) processes. As a sound wave propagates through a liquid medium, it generates two effects, namely, acoustic streaming and acoustic cavitation. Acoustic streaming refers to time independent motion of liquid due to viscous attenuation, while cavitation arises from the bubble activity generated due to {{the difference in the}} pressure field of the propagating wave. Cavitation can be classified into two categories, (1) stable and (2) transient cavitation. When a bubble undergoes continuous oscillations over repeated cycles it is known to exhibit stable cavitation, while a sudden collapse is referred to as transient cavitation. Due to the rapid implosion of the transient cavity, drastic conditions of temperature (5, 000 - 10, 000 K) and pressure (hundreds of bars) are generated within and surrounding the bubble. If this phenomenon occurs close to the substrate, it causes damage to the sub-micron features. In this study, emphasis has been laid on understanding acoustic cavitation as it is critical to achieving high cleaning efficiency without any feature damage. The research work described in this dissertation has been divided into three sections. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, the development of a novel sono-electrochemical technique for removal of sub-micron (300 nm) silica particles from conductive surfaces (Ta) has been discussed. The technique employs megasonic field at low pulse time and duty cycle in conjunction with an applied electrical field for achieving superior particle removal efficiency (PRE). In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the sono-electrochemical technique, cleaning studies were conducted using 300 nm silica particles both in the presence and absence of an applied electrical field in air and argon saturated solutions. In the presence of the megasonic field (0. 5 W/cm², 10 % duty cycle, 5 ms pulse time) alone, about 55 % PRE was observed in Ar saturated DI water, while in the presence of the sono-electrochemical field (- 1. 5 V vs Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl)), about 80 % PRE was measured. The enhancement in particle removal efficiency was attributed to oscillating hydrogen bubbles formed from water reduction in close vicinity of the tantalum surface, that grow to a resonant size under suitable acoustic conditions and likely cause removal of particles. Interestingly, increasing the applied potential to - 2 V (vs Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl)) enhanced the particle removal efficiency to about 100 %. Investigations were also performed in solutions containing 10 mM potassium chloride (KCl). The results revealed that even at low applied potentials of - 1. 5 V, almost complete particle removal was achieved. This improvement in PRE was attributed to a combined effect of microstreaming and electro-acoustic forces. The results revealed that almost complete removal of particles could be achieved at low power density and duty cycle when a sound field at 1 MHz is used in conjunction with electrochemistry. The second study focuses on the effect of acoustic frequency and transducer power density for the development of a damage-free megasonic cleaning process. Here, an effort was made to characterize cavitation activity at acoustic frequencies of 1, 2 and 3 MHz by means of electrochemical, acoustic emission and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. Studies conducted with a microelectrode using ferricyanide as an electroactive species showed that at 1 MHz and 2 W/cm², current peaks with a rise and fall time of about 30 - 50 ms and 80 - 120 ms were observed, respectively, which were indicative of transient cavitation behavior. Interestingly at higher frequencies (3 MHz), symmetric and oscillatory behavior in the current was observed. The rise and fall times were about 3 orders of magnitude lower at about 50 µs. This oscillatory behavior in the current at 3 MHz was attributed to the presence of stable cavities. Furthermore, hydrophone studies supported the microelectrode studies as they showed a reduction of about two orders of magnitude in the intensity of transient cavitation as frequency was increased from 1 to 3 MHz. Hydroxyl radical (OH*) capture measurements using terephthalate dosimetry corroborated the above results as they illustrated an order of magnitude decrease in OH* generation rate at 3 MHz compared to 1 MHz. These studies suggest that the use of higher megasonic frequencies may be more suitable for damage-free and effective cleaning of patterned surfaces in the semiconductor industry. In the last part of the dissertation, we investigate the effect of solution parameters on cavitation characteristics using a bicarbonate based <b>alkaline</b> chemical <b>cleaning</b> formulation that has been previously demonstrated to be beneficial in achieving effective megasonic cleaning and low damage. The results of this study revealed that in the presence of ammonia (NH₃) or carbonate/bicarbonate ions at concentrations greater than 75 mM or 200 mM respectively, the measured rate of generation of hydroxyl radicals at 1 MHz and 2 W/cm² was significantly reduced. The lower rate of OH· was attributed to scavenging of radicals in these solutions and additionally due to reduced transient cavitation in ammonia solutions. Hydroxyl radical measurements at higher power density of 8 W/cm² showed that carbonate ions were better scavengers of hydroxyl radicals than bicarbonate ions. The study on the effect of bulk solution temperature illustrated that the rate of generation of OH· increased with increase in temperature from 10 to 30 °C suggesting enhanced transient cavitation at higher temperatures (in the investigated range). The use of optimum concentration of ammonia or carbonates ions in cleaning formulation and bulk solution temperature would likely provide desired cleaning with minimum damage...|$|R

The results of mass balance suggested that a small fraction of DOC was responsible for membrane fouling caused by adsorption.

40|$|Although {{pre-treatment}} of membranes {{is often}} used to ensure the reliability of experimental data, it also has the potential to improve many aspects of membrane performance. This study investigates the influence of chemical pre-treatment and wetting on membrane flux and retention. The results show that chemical pre-treatment, with either a phosphate buffer or <b>alkaline</b> <b>cleaning</b> agents, enhances the flux and lowers the retention. Wetting at 40 degrees C after membrane cleaning increased the flux and retention, whereas wetting at 50 degrees C decreased the flux and increased the retention. No effect of pre-treatment with NaOH, at pH 9. 8 or 10. 4, was observed. The influence of NaCl on flux and surface contact angle was also evaluated, and pre-treatment with 0. 20 M NaCl(aq) was shown to increase the flux but to have no effect on surface contact angle. The origin of the positive effect of chemical pre-treatment on membrane flux appears to lie in the ion-membrane interactions within the membrane, where time and temperature are of importance. This would explain our finding that some of the positive effects of cleaning agents and NaCl on membrane flux are quickly lost after increasing the processing temperature during pure water flux measurements...|$|E
40|$|High {{pressures}} can {{be employed}} in shear-enhanced nanofiltration (NF) process {{in order to obtain}} large permeate flux, and under this extreme hydraulic condition, membrane fouling behavior may be different and need to be investigated. In this study, a rotating disk laboratory module capable of very high shear rates and pressure was used to treat model dairy wastewater with a NF 270 membrane. The presence of lipids had a negligible effect on flux profile and permeate quality, although it slightly increased adsorption fouling. Higher shear rates decreased concentration polarization and produced higher permeate fluxes with lower permeability loss. After the flux remained stable for several hours, adsorption fouling and subsequent cake layer formation occurred. The surface adsorption of small foulants such as lactose and calcium ions caused a slow flux decline, {{and in the absence of}} chemical cleaning, it induced cake fouling and severe flux decline. Inorganic ions such as calcium and phosphate engaged with milk proteins in micelles or aggregates, and thus inorganic scaling was negligible and <b>alkaline</b> <b>cleaning</b> could remove most surface fouling. We concluded that, with suitable chemical cleaning, a high and stable flux could be obtained for a long time in dairy wastewater treatment by NF under shear-enhanced extreme hydraulic conditions.

40|$|Copper {{surfaces}} {{can become}} contaminated by slurry particles and organic residues during {{chemical mechanical planarization}} (CMP). Silica particles are widely used as abrasives, while benzotriazole (BTA) is widely used as corrosion inhibitor, in copper CMP slurries. The contaminated copper surface needs to be cleaned by using an effective cleaning solution. These material contaminate the copper surface during CMP {{and need to be}} removed by using an effective cleaning solution. The objectives of this work were to develop a non-amine-based <b>alkaline</b> <b>cleaning</b> solution and characterize the solution based on the benzotriazole (organic residue) removal and particle removal efficiency. Cesium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide were used as cleaning agents and ethylene glycol was used as a corrosion inhibitor. Ethylene glycol acts as a chelating agent as well in the cleaning composition. BTA removal was characterized using contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The corrosion protection ability of the cleaning solutions was quantified by potentiodynamic polarization studies. Both potassium hydroxide- and cesium hydroxide-based solutions exhibited high BTA and silica particle removal. When compared to a potassium hydroxide based cleaning solution, cesium hydroxide based cleaning solutions were found to be more effective in terms of low surface roughness and low etch rate...|$|E
40|$|Titanium hexafluoride pretreatments {{are known}} to improve paint {{adhesion}} and function as a barrier between the coating and the hot dip galvanized (HDG) steel surface. Interactions at the zinc/pretreatment interface are of utmost importance {{for the formation of}} pretreatment layers and the corrosion resistance of color coated hot dip galvanized steels. Removal rate of inert aluminum oxide from HDG steel samples by chemical dissolution was studied. XPS measurements showed that the surface Al 2 O 3 layer thickness decreased rapidly already at mild <b>alkaline</b> <b>cleaning,</b> while complete removal of Al required severe etching. Low reactivity of an Al 2 O 3 -rich surface was confirmed by impaired formation of a titanium hexafluoride pretreatment layer. Grain boundaries and deformation twinnings were shown to be of importance for the reactivity of the HDG surface and for the precipitation of the pretreatment chemical. Helium ion microscopy images and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) of a pretreated sample showed accumulation of the pretreatment chemical at the grain boundaries. Al removal rate was fast at the deformation twinnings at the grain plateaus. Slow Al removal was observed at dendritic valleys and grain boundaries. The results increase understanding of the reactivity of hot dip galvanized steel surface...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} reports an optimum NaOH concentration for the <b>alkaline</b> <b>cleaning</b> of whey deposits or gels; at NaOH concentrations higher than this optimum, cleaning proceeds much more slowly. Although {{this phenomenon is}} of great importance in the cleaning of dairy equipment, no conclusive physical explanation has yet been presented. In this study, we present strong evidence that the dissolution rate {{is affected by the}} equilibrium-swelling ratio in β-lactoglobulin (βLg) gels. The swelling ratio is greatly reduced in the presence of salts due to the polyelectrolyte screening effect of the cations. This has been observed in free-swelling βLg gels using gravimetrical analysis and in the uniaxial swelling of WPC gel deposits using fluid dynamic gauging. At high dissolution pH (> 13. 3), the high Na+ concentration reduces swelling in spite of the high surface charge of the protein. It is proposed that the reduction of the free volume inside the gel impedes the transport of the protein aggregates out of the NaOH penetration zone. We have also observed that the final dissolution rate of gels pre-soaked in 1 M NaOH or NaCl is similar, despite the difference in pH, and much lower than for untreated gels: the high Na+ concentration in the soaked gels hinders swelling, inhibiting the disentanglement of the protein clusters regardless of the high p...|$|E
40|$|Scaling and (bio) fouling {{phenomena}} can severely {{alter the}} performance of the reverse osmosis process during desalination of seawater. Pretreatments must be applied to efficiently remove particles, colloids, and also precursors of the organic fouling and biofouling. Ceramic membranes offer a lot of advantages for micro and ultrafiltration pretreatments because their initial properties can be recovered using more severe cleaning procedure. The study focuses on the interaction between metal oxides and marine organic matter. Experiments were performed at laboratory scale. The first series of experiments focus on the filtration of different fractions of natural organic matter and model compounds solutions on flat disk ceramic membranes (47 mm of diameter) characterized with different pore size and composition. Direct filtration experiments were conducted at 0. 7 bar or 2 bars and at room temperature (20 ± 0. 5 °C). The efficiency of backflush and <b>alkaline</b> <b>cleaning</b> were eval, and titanium oxides. Each metal oxide corresponds to a specific pore size for the disk ceramic membranes: 80, 60, and 30 nm. Different sizes of metal oxide particles are used to measure the impact of the surface area on the adsorption of the organic matter. Seawaters from the Arabian Gulf and from the Red Sea were collected during algal blooms. Cultures of algae were also performed in the laboratory and in cooperation with woods hole oceanographic institute. Solutions of algal exudates were obtained after a couple of weeks of cultivation followed by sonication. Solutions were successively filtered through GFF (0. 7 lm) and 0. 45 lm membrane filters before use. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of final solution was between 1 and 4 mg/L and showed strong hydrophilic character. These various solutions were prepared with the objective to mimic the dissolved organic matter composition of seawater subjected to algal bloom. Characterization of the solutions of filtration experiments (feed water, permeate water, and back-washes) and batch experiments (raw solution and supernatant solutions) included fluorescence, UV, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and Liquid Chromatography - Organic Carbon Detection measurements. In comparison to seawater under normal condition, seawa- ters collected during algal bloom and algal exudates solutions led to very severe fouling of all ceramic membranes (with some DOC removal of 10 - 20 %). It is important to indicate that algal exudate permeates still exert fouling properties when filtered through similar new (virgin) membrane. These results indicate that both size exclusion and adsorption phenomena occur (on surface, inside pores). In all cases, the backflush (performed with MilliQ [MQ]) showed minor or no effect and the cleaning backwash was not able to recover the initial flux (30 - 60 %). Analyses performed on the backflush solution (performed with MQ) and on the <b>alkaline</b> <b>cleaning</b> solution revealed the retention of both high and low molecular organics on the different metal oxides. Unfortunately, analyses of membrane surface using imaging various tools are not providing informative results in term of foulant/adsorbed material composition. © 2013 Desalination Publications.

40|$|Membrane {{technologies}} grow {{rapidly in}} the world and were applied in many industrial processes as an efficient separation technique and for the purpose of wastewater treatment. Membrane separation process was used to replace the conventional method to reduce time of operation, reduce space requirement for downstream process and increase the productivity. There are several types of membrane separation used in the industries which are ultrafiltration, microfiltration, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis. These membrane separations used different types of membrane such as flat sheet, hollow fiber and other. Even though membrane separation has many advantages, it also has a problem which is membrane fouling that resulting in reduces permeate flux and increase the production cost. This study is undertaken to identify and determine the resistances that lead membrane fouling by using Resistance-In-Series Model and Darcy’s Law. A cross-flow filtration with polysulfone hollow fiber membrane of molecular pore size 0. 2 μm was used to separate the buffer solution containing Escherichia coli. From the data obtained, the weak adsorption resistance was explored as the main factor resulting membrane fouling in this study. For the membrane recovery, the <b>alkaline</b> <b>cleaning</b> can recover the fouled membrane about 99. 8 % and it could help increasing the permeate flux for separation process. E. coli K- 12 strain was identified which can give high permeate flux compared to E. coli B strain. Thus, E. coli K- 12 can be retained by membrane in the separation of succinic acid from fermentation broth...|$|E
30|$|Aluminum and its alloys {{are known}} as the second largest {{attractive}} materials next to iron. AA is currently being used in {{a broad range of}} applications due to its low cost, light weight, high thermal and electrical conductivity, aerospace, construction, and electrical power generation. A very good characteristic of AA is its high corrosion resistance behavior toward a wide variety of corrosive environments, because of the formation of a protective, tightly adhered invisible oxide film on the metal surface. But alkaline solution is the most dangerous medium for the corrosion of aluminum among several corrosive media. However, corrosion data are less readily available in this environment [1]. It is therefore desired to study the corrosion inhibition effect on aluminum in alkaline medium. Alkaline solutions are generally used for the removal of undesirable scale and rust in several industrial processes, and metal loss occurs in this medium. The corrosion behavior of AA in alkaline medium has also been extensively studied {{in the development of the}} aluminum anode in aluminum-air cell. Self-corrosion is not only responsible for the lower utilization efficiency of aluminum but also for the battery explosion due to severe hydrogen evolution [2]. To improve the efficiency in devices (Al alkaline battery) and various industrial processes such as <b>alkaline</b> <b>cleaning,</b> pickling, and etching, a plenty of organic and inorganic corrosion inhibitors have been used previously [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. But using the compound as an inhibitor is a major drawback because some of them are synthetic chemicals, expensive, and hazardous to the environment.|$|E
