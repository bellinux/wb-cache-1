5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} in Ohio {{and raised in the}} Lutheran faith. He moved to Kansas when he was 18 and embraced Seventh-day Adventism.

Eventually, Beilhart came to believe that it was more important to put faith into practice helping others so he left preaching to study nursing and work in a sanitarium. He returned to Ohio in 1899 to start the Spirit Fruit Society, an intentional community based on his experiences, learning, <b>and</b> <b>views.</b> Beilhart led the group for nine years before he died of appendicitis and peritonitis in 1908.

5|$|Choe's diary {{accounts}} of his travels in China became widely {{printed in the}} 16th century in both Korea and Japan. Modern historians also refer to his written works, since his travel diary provides a unique outsider's perspective on Chinese culture in the 15th century and valuable information on China's cities and regional differences. The attitudes and opinions expressed in his writing represent in part the standpoints <b>and</b> <b>views</b> of the 15th century Confucian Korean literati, who viewed Chinese culture as compatible with and similar to their own. His description of cities, people, customs, cuisines, and maritime commerce along China's Grand Canal provides insight into the daily life of China and how it differed between northern and southern China during the 15th century.|$|E

Both men, former cricket players at the ICY, believed baseball was another outlet for African Americans to promote social reform and prove their right for full citizenship. In the spring of 1866, White and Catto established the Philadelphia Pythians, a baseball club composed mainly of men from the Knights of Pythias fraternal organization. Catto, a hard-hitting shortstop and second baseman, was the de facto captain on the field, while White became the team's secretary, responsible for scheduling games, arranging festivities, and recording statistics. Soon, Pythian games became a popular fixture of the black community.|$|E

Catherwood never published any drawings of the site and Stephens reported that the locals had plundered the stone at the site {{for many years in}} order to use it for building materials in Tecpán.

5|$|Wisemore's {{character}} introduces {{feelings about}} the London community and criticises various problems.

Merital, in response to Wisemore, believes that Wisemore's philosophical inclinations are foolish.

5|$|According to Sarma, Gandhi {{recruited}} {{women to}} participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as political shield. When women insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions <b>and</b> <b>views,</b> Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in a manner Gandhi inspired.|$|E
5|$|During {{the era of}} the {{collodion}} process, {{before the}} arrival of less demanding photographic technology (the gelatin silver process, photographic film, and smaller cameras) and the consequent rise of amateur photography, commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events <b>and</b> <b>views.</b> In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more significant because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated that about half of all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.|$|E
5|$|Felice Beato (1832 – 29 January 1909), {{also known}} as Felix Beato, was an Italian–British photographer. He {{was one of the}} first people to take {{photographs}} in East Asia and one of the first war photographers. He is noted for his genre works, portraits, <b>and</b> <b>views</b> and panoramas of the architecture and landscapes of Asia and the Mediterranean region. Beato's travels gave him the opportunity to create images of countries, people, and events that were unfamiliar and remote to most people in Europe and North America. His work provides images of such events as the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the Second Opium War, and represents the first substantial body of photojournalism. He had an impact on other photographers, and his influence in Japan, where he taught and worked with numerous other photographers and artists, was particularly deep and lasting.|$|E
