THE EFFECT OF THE VARIATION OF CORE THICKNESS ON BENDING CHARACTERISTIC OF CANTULAS’ FIBER SANDWICH COMPOSITE WITH THE TYPE COMBINATION C-FLUTE AND <b>A-FLUTE</b> OF CARDBOARD HONEYCOMB CORE. Thesis: Faculty of Teacher Training and Education Science Sebelas Maret University Surakarta, October, 2013. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the effect of the variation of core thickness on strength bending characteristic of cantulas’ fiber sandwich composite with the type combination C-Flute and <b>A-Flute</b> of cardboard honeycomb core. Cantulas’ fiber is used to make the skin by applied it in the same way and get alkali (2...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze for {{resonant}} frequency, vibration transmissibility and damping ratio of multi-layered corrugated structures using a random vibration test. Methods: The random vibration test was performed by the ASTM D 4728 specifications using two paperboards (S 120, K 180) and two types of flutes (A/F, B/F). Damping ratio of the multi-layered corrugated structures was estimated using a theoretical equation derived from the measured resonant frequency and transmissibility. Results: The resonant frequency and vibration transmissibility of the multi-layered corrugated structures of K 180 and B-flute were higher than those of S 120 and <b>A-flute,</b> respectively; however, the damping ratio of each sample had the opposite tendency. The resonant frequency was inversely proportional to the sample thickness and static stress; vibration transmissibility and damping ratio were not correlated with sample thickness and static stress. In addition, we developed a mathematical model of the resonant frequency with variables of sample thickness and static stress. Conclusions: Results of this study can be useful for environment-friendly and optimal packaging design sinc...|$|E
