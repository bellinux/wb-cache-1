5|$|Hafnium {{reserves}} {{have been}} infamously estimated to last under 10 years by one source {{if the world}} population increases and demand grows.

5|$|Members of the Cucurbitaceae include gourds, melons, pumpkins, and squashes. Seeds {{from these}} plants are noted for their oil content, but little {{information}} is available on methods of extracting the oil. In most cases, the plants are grown as food, with dietary use of the oils as <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> using the seeds as food.|$|E
5|$|The {{price for}} pure bismuth metal has been {{relatively}} stable {{through most of the}} 20th century, except for a spike in the 1970s. Bismuth has always been produced mainly as <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> lead refining, and thus the price usually reflected the cost of recovery and the balance between production and demand.|$|E

40|$|We compute {{commutativity}} {{degrees of}} wreath products A o B of finite Abelian groups A and B. When B is fixed of order n the asymptotic commutativity degree of such wreath products is 1 /n 2. This answers a generalized {{version of a}} question posed by P.

2500|$|Antimatter {{is likely}} to be {{produced}} as <b>an</b> industrial <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of megascale engineering processes (such as the aforementioned star lifting) and, therefore, could be recycled.|$|R
5|$|Whereas bismuth is most {{available}} {{today as a}} byproduct, its sustainability is more dependent on recycling. Bismuth is mostly <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> the smelting of lead, and also of tungsten and copper production. Recycling bismuth is difficult in many of its end uses, primarily because of scattering.|$|E
5|$|According to the United States Geological Survey, {{the world}} mining {{production}} of bismuth in 2014 was 13,600 tonnes, {{with the major}} contributions from China (7,600 tonnes), Vietnam (4,950 tonnes) and Mexico (948 tonnes). The refinery production in 2010 was 16,000 tonnes, of which China produced 13,000, Mexico 850 and Belgium 800 tonnes. The difference reflects bismuth's status as <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> extraction of other metals such as lead, copper, tin, molybdenum and tungsten.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a minor {{component}} in most zinc ores and is <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is cadmium telluride solar panels.|$|E

5|$|Indium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> zinc refinement. It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass. Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{could be}} {{considered}} {{one of the founders of}} modern Germany. After dissolving the Holy Roman Empire, he reduced the number of German states from 300 to less than 50, prior to the German Unification. <b>A</b> <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> the French occupation was a strong development in German nationalism. Napoleon also significantly aided the United States when he agreed to sell the territory of Louisiana for 15 million dollars during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson. That territory almost doubled the size of the United States, adding the equivalent of 13 states to the Union.|$|E
5|$|Other {{noble gases}} would be equally {{suitable}} {{for most of}} these applications, but argon {{is by far the}} cheapest. Argon is inexpensive, since it occurs naturally in air and is readily obtained as <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> cryogenic air separation in the production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen: the primary constituents of air are used on a large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except helium) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful by far. The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.|$|E

5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aspirin {{is classified as}} an esterification reaction. Salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride, an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's hydroxyl group into an ester group (R-OH â†’ R-OCOCH3). This process yields aspirin and acetic acid, which is considered <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> this reaction. Small amounts of sulfuric acid (and occasionally phosphoric acid) are almost always used as a catalyst. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium occurs {{naturally}} in about 65 different minerals and in fossil fuel deposits. It {{is produced in}} China and Russia from steel smelter slag; other countries produce it either from the flue dust of heavy oil, or as <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> uranium mining. It is mainly used to produce specialty steel alloys such as high-speed tool steels. The most important industrial vanadium compound, vanadium pentoxide, {{is used as a}} catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|A later model {{suggested}} that confinement {{resulted from a}} co-rotational eccentricity resonance (CER). The model {{takes into account the}} finite mass of the Adams ring, which is necessary to move the resonance closer to the ring. <b>A</b> <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> this theory is a mass estimate for the Adams ringâ€”about 0.002 of the mass of Galatea. A third theory proposed in 1986 requires an additional moon orbiting inside the ring; the arcs in this case are trapped in its stable Lagrangian points. However Voyager 2s observations placed strict constraints on the size and mass of any undiscovered moons, making such a theory unlikely. Some other more complicated theories hold that a number of moonlets are trapped in co-rotational resonances with Galatea, providing confinement of the arcs and simultaneously serving as sources of the dust.|$|E
50|$|Spanish {{surnames}} {{are still}} prevalent on Guam, and {{the custom of}} women keeping their maiden names after marriage is <b>a</b> both <b>byproduct</b> <b>of</b> Spanish culture on these islands {{as well as the}} matrilineal structure of indigenous Chamorro culture.|$|R
40|$|Using vertex {{operator}} {{we study}} Macdonald symmetric functions of rectangular shapes and their {{connection with the}} q-Dyson Laurent polynomial. We find a vertex operator realization of Macdonald functions and thus give a generalized Frobenius formula for them. <b>As</b> <b>byproducts</b> <b>of</b> the realization, we find a q-Dyson constant term orthogonality relation which generalizes a conjecture due to Kadell in 2000, and we generalize Matsumoto's hyperdeterminant formula for rectangular Jack functions to Macdonald functions.
