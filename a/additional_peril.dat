Rather, the Article raises the possibility that many of the concerns associated with FSHCs’ activities could be addressed through a greater governance focus on one constituency, in particular: those who seek out, and benefit from, FSHCs’ traditional and foundational business operations—namely, clients and customers...|$|E
