40|$|The Companies Amendment Act 37 of 1999 {{brought about}} a major change to the South African company law, the Amendment Act {{introduced}} share buyback provisions to our company law. The legislature had finally responded to numerous calls for amendments to our company law, particularly amendments that would make share buyback by a company of its own shares and share buyback by subsidiary company of shares in its holding company possible. The Amendment Act operated in a statutory scheme to which the capital maintenance doctrine was applicable, it was thus necessary that the Companies Act 61 of 1973 be overhauled and this was done through {{the enactment of the}} Companies Act 71 of 2008. On 1 st May 2011, the Companies Act 71 of 2008 finally came into effect. This study is principally about the provisions governing a company’s <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> in terms of the new Companies Act. I will first give an exposition of the evolution of our Companies Act from capital maintenance to solvency and liquidity. I will then contrast the share buyback provisions of the 1973 Companies Act with the current Companies Act, I will also discuss and analyse the provision governing distributions in general and those pertaining to <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> in terms of section 48 of the Companies Act 71 of 2008.

Market equilibrium {{is regarded as}} a dynamic equilibrium characterized by a time-invariant probability distribution over microfinancial states, marginal redistributions of portfolios are regarded as indistinguishable, and real and fiat assets are regarded as essentially distinct.

40|$|Text in AfrikaansThe Companies Act, 1973 ("the Act") {{contains}} no specific provision {{dealing with the}} relationship between a nominee shareholder and its principal, the beneficial shareholder. The Act merely contains a variety of references to this unique relationship without specifying the content thereof or elaborating {{on the rights of the}} beneficial shareholder. It is clear from the Act that no legal connection exists between the company and the beneficial shareholder and a company is only obliged to recognise its registered members. It has become apparent that beneficial shareholders need more protection than is currently afforded to them in terms of our common law. Currently beneficial shareholders have a common law right to claim return of their shares from any person (even bona fide third parties) in the event of the misappropriation of such shares by their nominee shareholders. Beneficial shareholders are unprotected if their nominee shareholders were to act contrary to their instructions, for example by not voting at the general meeting in accordance with the instructions of the beneficial shareholders. Having regard to the fact that the relationship between the beneficial shareholder and the nominee shareholder is based on agency or trusteeship, the beneficial shareholder will be entitle to compel its nominee to transfer the shares to another person. This may, however, have stamp duty implications and if the nominee refuses to give its cooperation in respect of such transfer, costly legal action may be the only solution for the beneficial shareholder. In deciding which section of the Act should be adapted to include the rights of beneficial shareholders, the following sections have been considered: Section 266 (statutory derivative action), section 252 (statutory remedy in the event of prejudice), section 440 K (compulsory <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> of minorities) and section 344 (h) (liquidation on grounds of equity). The only one of these sections which provides the court with a wide enough discretion to afford the required protection is section 252. An important point in this regard is that section 252 cannot effectively be extended to beneficial shareholders unless they also acquire the right to have access to the same company information as the members of the company would receive. In an attempt to create a balance between the needs to greater protection of beneficial shareholders and the avoidance of unnecessary cumbersome administrative obligations on companies, it is suggested that a register of beneficial shareholders be created and that companies be obliged to inform all beneficial shareholders appearing on such register of the same company information as is provided to registered members. The Act must make it clear that : • a beneficial shareholder can only be recorded in the register with the assistance of its nominee shareholder; • the relevant nominee shareholder must satisfy the company secretary that the person which is recorded in the register is in fact its principal; • the only two instances where the company secretary will be entitled to remove the beneficial shareholder is in the first instance where the beneficia] shareholder consents to such removal and secondly where the shares held by the registered member is transferred. The latter ground will avoid continued provision of company information to persons not involved with the company. No duty will be placed on companies to ensure that the names and addresses of beneficial shareholders are correct. This will be the responsibility of beneficial shareholders. The improved flow of company information will facilitate the improved awareness by beneficial shareholders of relevant events and together with the appropriate extension of section 252, will go a long way in improving the much needed protection of beneficial shareholders.
