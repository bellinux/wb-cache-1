25|$|As {{technology}} {{continues to}} advance, {{more can be}} added onto the controller to give the player a more immersive experience when playing different games. There are some controllers that have presets so that the buttons are mapped a certain way to make playing certain games easier. Along with the presets, a player can sometimes custom map the buttons to better accommodate their play style. On keyboard and mouse, different actions in the game are already preset to keys on the keyboard. Most games allow the player to change that so that the actions are mapped to different keys that are more to their liking.

Once his car returned to parc fermé, it failed post-race scrutineering, and was found to have a modified front wing, leading to his disqualification. This meant that Jérôme d'Ambrosio was handed his first Formula E victory, moving him into fifth place in the drivers' championship. Nelson Piquet, Jr. recovered from his [...] "dismal" [...] qualifying performance to finish an eventual fourth, taking the championship lead. While e.dams Renault retained their lead in the teams' championship, the strong result for the Dragon Racing squad meant they moved up into second. The Abt team decided not to appeal the decision against Di Grassi, while emphasizing that the front wing did not lead to a performance advantage. Di Grassi himself responded on Twitter, writing: [...] "They <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> me win this championship in the hard mode.

Taylor and Marley's wife sustained serious injuries, but later made full recoveries. Bob Marley received minor wounds in the chest and arm. The attempt on his life was thought to have been politically motivated, as many felt the concert was really a support rally for Manley. Nonetheless, the concert proceeded, and an injured Marley performed as scheduled, two days after the attempt. When asked why, Marley responded, [...] "The people who <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this world worse aren't taking a day off. How can I?"

500|$|Pavelić and his {{followers}} intended to create an [...] "ethnically pure" [...] Croatia through the mass murder and deportation of Serbs, Jews and other non-Croats. Only about {{fifty percent of the}} NDH's 6.2 million inhabitants were Croat. Nearly two million Serbs, about one-third of the NDH's total population, now found themselves within the borders of the newly formed state. In addition, Serb-majority areas covered between 60 and 70 percent of the NDH's total landmass. [...] "The Croatian state cannot exist if 1.8 million Serbs are living in it and if we have a powerful Serbian state at our backs," [...] Croatia's future Foreign Minister Mladen Lorković explained. [...] "Therefore, we <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the Serbs disappear from our regions." [...] Dido Kvaternik, a senior Ustaše official, was entrusted with [...] "cleansing" [...] Bjelovar and its surroundings. The younger Kvaternik recalled: [...] "When we triumphantly returned home from abroad and when Pavelić decided that I should take over the implementation of the measures against Serbs and Jews, I obeyed immediately and without hesitation because I knew that this question had to be resolved {{for the future of the}} Croatian people and state, and that someone had to make the sacrifice so that these odious but necessary measures could be carried out." [...] Pavelić's orders for the extermination of non-Croats in and around Bjelovar were likely delivered orally to ensure that no written evidence remained.|$|E
