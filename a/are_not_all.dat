5|$|According to Keller's conjecture, any tiling of {{the plane}} by {{congruent}} squares must include two squares that meet edge-to-edge. None of the squares in the Pythagorean tiling meet edge-to-edge, but this fact does not violate Keller's conjecture because the tiles have different sizes, so they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> congruent to each other.|$|E
5|$|Deformed matrices, {{consisting}} of randomly oriented nanochannels in a spongelike keratin matrix, create the diffuse non-iridescent blue colour of Ara ararauna, the blue-and-yellow macaw. Since the reflections <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> arranged {{in the same}} direction, the colours, while still magnificent, do not vary much with angle, so they are not iridescent.|$|E
5|$|In the synoptics, the {{ministry}} of Jesus takes a single year, but in John it takes three, as evidenced by references to three Passovers. Events <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> in the same order: {{the date of the}} crucifixion is different, as is the time of Jesus' anointing in Bethany, and the cleansing of the temple occurs in the beginning of Jesus' ministry rather than near its end.|$|E

There were many nationalities among them: Greek, Latvian, Jewish, Russian, Georgian, Armenian and Azerbaijani.|$|R

5|$|The {{effect of}} {{diffusion}} damping is greatly augmented by the finite {{width of the}} surface of last scattering (SLS). The finite width of the SLS means the CMB photons we see were not all emitted at the same time, and the fluctuations we see <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> in phase. It also means that during recombination, the diffusion length changed dramatically, as the ionisation fraction shifted.|$|E
5|$|Effects <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> negative; for example, {{wind farms}} produce {{renewable}} energy, helping {{to mitigate the}} single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones can kill many birds in collisions. For example, at the Altamont Pass in California, the golden eagle has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area. Thus, there is a trade-off in the siting of any wind farm.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} the Forgotten Realms setting is the {{continent}} of Faerûn, part of the fictional world of Abeir-Toril, usually called simply Toril, an Earth-like planet with many real-world influences. Unlike Earth, the lands of the Forgotten Realms <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> ruled by the human race: the planet Toril is shared by humans, dwarves, elves, goblins, orcs, and other peoples and creatures. Technologically, {{the world of the}} Forgotten Realms is not nearly as advanced as that of Earth; in this respect, it resembles the pre-industrial Earth of the 13th or 14th century. However, the presence of magic provides an additional element of power to the societies. There are several nation states and many independent cities, with loose alliances being formed for defense or conquest. Trade is performed by ship or horse-drawn vehicle, and manufacturing is based upon cottage industry.|$|E

These <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> manifolds, but (in high dimension) can be analyzed by surgery theory similarly to manifolds, and failure to be a manifold is a local obstruction, as in surgery theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{reserve is}} a very {{important}} habitat for native fauna, particularly small mammals, reptiles and amphibians. Southern brown bandicoots, swamp wallabies, echidnas, and brushtail and ringtail possums are present but are often hard to find as they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> active during the day.

25|$|Perhaps {{the easiest}} face vise to install is the {{self-contained}} iron vise, {{sometimes called the}} 'quick-action' vise (except they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> quick-action). This tool comes already assembled and only has to be mounted to the bench. Usually, auxiliary wooden jaws are added. The quick-action feature makes setting it much quicker and is quickly taken for granted. Not only are these vises easy to install and use, they are also robust. Their main drawback is the relatively high cost.|$|E
