40|$|Aim: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between gross regional product (GRP) per capita and prehospital management, in-hospital quality of care and functional outcome after stroke. Methods: The study {{was based on the}} China National Stroke Registry between 2007 and 2008. Based on the <b>average</b> <b>GRP</b> per capita in 2008, provinces in China were divided into developed and underdeveloped areas. Two variables and ten performance measures were used as quality indicators for prehospital management and in-hospital care, respectively. Good functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 2 at discharge. A composite measure was calculated by using an opportunity-based score. A generalized estimation equation was performed to adjust for confounders. Results: For ischemic stroke (acute ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack), compared with patients in the underdeveloped area (n = 7573), those in the developed area (n = 8516) received better prehospital management (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1. 03; 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 04; p < 0. 001) and a higher quality of in-hospital care (adjusted OR: 1. 02; 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 1. 03; p < 0. 001). Higher GRP per capita was significantly associated with better functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 2) at discharge after ischemic stroke (adjusted OR: 1. 11; 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 20; p < 0. 001). A similar association between GRP per capita and prehospital management (p < 0. 001) and primary outcome (p < 0. 001) was found for hemorrhagic stroke (subarachnoid hemorrhage/intracranial hemorrhage). Conclusion: Higher GRP per capita was associated with better prehospital, in-hospital quality of stroke care and functional outcome at discharge after acute stroke. © 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.

30|$|The Moran scatterplot {{shows the}} spatial lag (i.e. the <b>average</b> of the <b>GRP</b> effects for the neighbors) on the {{vertical}} axis {{and the value}} at each governorate on the horizontal axis.

40|$|The {{character}} of energy {{consumption in the}} regions is connected with the patterns of economic growth and sectoral structure of GRP. In modern economic literature the regions are divided into raw-material, manufacturing, budget-dependent, agriculturalbioresource, raw material, trading-financial and differentiated. However, there is no generally accepted procedure for this classification, moreover such division is purely statistical, the GRP structure is changeable {{in the course of}} time. For that reason, development of general methods of regional grouping according to their GRP structure is of scientific and practical interest for monitoring the implementation of state energy efficiency policy to compare energy intensity indexes of different territorial entities of the Russian Federation. The present article outlines the method of the Russian regions grouping that is based on distinguishing the homogenous groups of regions from the totality, these groups are characterized by the predominance of one sector in the sectoral structure of their GRP (in comparison with the national average. The method is based on the following principles: formation of enlarged GRP sectors, application of k-means cluster analysis and follow-up monitoring modified criterion of forming regions’ groups homogeneity. Applying this method, five intercrossing groups of regions are formed according to the production profile type. In addition, the group of diversified regions with structure close to the national average is subjoined. The territorial entities of the Russian Federation are grouped according to GRP structure basing on the official data of the Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat). The inbetween-groups comparison of <b>average</b> indexes of <b>GRP</b> energy intensity is carried out. It has been established that despite the obvious importance of structural factor it is not sufficient for analysis of regional economics energy intensity. The reasons are given for possible application of the proposed method in the dynamic multiple classification analysis of regional energy efficiency...|$|R
