He played a thief in Man on the Train, which starred Donald Sutherland. Filmed in Orangeville, Ontario, Canada, Man on the Train was released in 2011. The following year, {{it was announced that}} Mullen would appear in his second film, <b>A</b> <b>Thousand</b> <b>Times</b> Goodnight, starring Juliette Binoche. On 3 September 2013 the film won Special Grand Prix of the Jury at Montreal World Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which the Solar System ends and {{interstellar}} space begins is not precisely defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the solar wind's influence is roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun; this heliopause, the outer boundary of the heliosphere, is considered the beginning of the interstellar medium. The Sun's Hill sphere, the effective range of its gravitational dominance, is thought to extend up to <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> farther and encompasses the theorized Oort cloud.|$|E

5|$|An Inconvenient Truth is a 2006 American {{documentary}} film directed by Davis Guggenheim about former United States Vice President Al Gore's campaign to educate citizens {{about global warming}} via a comprehensive slide show that, by his own estimate made in the film, he has given more than <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>times.</b> The idea to document his efforts came from producer Laurie David, who saw his presentation at a town-hall meeting on global warming, which coincided {{with the opening of}} The Day After Tomorrow. Laurie David was so inspired by Gore's slide show that she, with producer Lawrence Bender, met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film.|$|E
5|$|The German-born British {{physicist}} Arthur Schuster expanded upon Crookes' experiments {{by placing}} metal plates {{parallel to the}} cathode rays and applying an electric potential between the plates. The field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that the rays carried negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of current, in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the charge-to-mass ratio of the ray components. However, this produced a value {{that was more than}} <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.|$|E
5|$|The solar wind, {{a stream}} of charged {{particles}} flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is {{the point at which}} pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out {{to the edge of the}} scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|Although entries of meteoroids into Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{are very}} common, recording a similar flight through the upper {{layers of the}} atmosphere is quite rare. Probably the first one reliably verified happened on 20 July 1860 above the American state of New York. The Czechoslovak–Polish fireball is sometimes compared to the 1972Great Daylight Fireball above Utah, the United States, and Alberta, Canada, {{which is the first}} scientifically observed and studied event of this type. The 1972 fireball was more than <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> as massive and it got 40km closer to Earth's surface. Observational data from both of them helped to develop a method for computing the grazing trajectories of such bodies, which was later used when calculating the trajectory of another Earth-grazing meteoroid, observed on 29 March 2006 above Japan.|$|E
5|$|If, in {{the famous}} garden and {{cemetery}} scenes the dialogue of the two lovers, Juliet's asides, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons are numerous and easy to comprehend. First, and this alone would be sufficient, it is a symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature have been handled vocally <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression. It is also because the very sublimity of this love made its depiction so dangerous for the musician {{that he had to}} give his imagination a latitude that the positive sense of the sung words would not have given him, resorting instead to instrumental language, which is richer, more varied, less precise, and by its very indefiniteness incomparably more powerful in such a case.|$|E

50|$|The {{luminosity}} of RV Tau variables {{is typically}} <b>a</b> few <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> the sun, which places {{them at the}} upper end of the W Virginis instability strip. Therefore, RV Tau variables along with W Vir variables are sometimes considered a subclass of Type II Cepheids. They exhibit relationships between their periods, masses, and luminosity, although not with the precision of more conventional Cepheid variables. Although the spectra appear as supergiants, usually Ib, occasionally Ia, the actual luminosities are only <b>a</b> few <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> the sun. The supergiant luminosity classes are due to very low surface gravities on pulsating low-mass and rarefied stars.|$|R
50|$|Giant {{stars have}} radii up {{to a few}} hundred times the Sun and luminosities between 10 and <b>a</b> few <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> that of the Sun. Stars still more {{luminous}} than giants {{are referred to as}} supergiants and hypergiants.|$|R

50|$|In a {{globular}} cluster 65 million light years from Earth evidence is accumulating {{that a black}} hole, one <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> more massive than the sun, has caused {{the destruction of a}} white dwarf star. It appears that the white dwarf is heating up as it falls toward the black hole. This event creates an intense stellar astrophysical X-ray source, called an ultraluminous X-ray source. The indication of this type of strong X-ray source means that it is more luminous than any known stellar X-ray source, but less luminous than the X-ray intensity of supermassive black holes, which places it in the range of theorized intermediate black holes. Their exact nature of ULXs has remained a mystery, but one suggestion is that some ULXs are black holes with masses between about a hundred and <b>a</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>times</b> that of the Sun.|$|R
25|$|The {{apparent}} {{brightness of}} Mercury {{as seen from}} Earth is greatest at phase angle 0° (superior conjunction with the Sun) when it can reach magnitude −2.6.

25|$|Because quasars are distant objects, {{any light}} which reaches the Earth is redshifted {{due to the}} metric {{expansion}} of space.
