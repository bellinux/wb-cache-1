40|$|When a {{residential}} property, {{being used for}} commercial purposes is sold to a buyer that intends to operate a professional practice from the premises {{and one of the}} vendors is registered for GST, what happens when the registered vendor deregisters from GST ten days before settlement? The purchaser expects to be able to claim the GST included in the price as an input tax credit but on settlement is not given a tax invoice. The purchaser then lodges the Business <b>Activity</b> <b>Statement</b> (BAS) claiming an input tax credit without a tax invoice. The purchaser believed that the Commissioner of Taxation would exercise his discretion under s 29 - 70 (2) or under s 29 - 10 (10) of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth), (GST Act) and treat the contract for sale as a tax invoice.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAn {{impact of}} regular {{physical}} activity on the abdominal muscles may be significant when comparing various symptomatic groups. However, there is lack comprehensive information in this field. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the lateral abdominal wall at rest and during abdominal drawing-in manoeuvre in adolescent physically active girls in different body positions. MethodsFemale students, 13 – 17 years of age, participated in the study. Participants were divided into two groups based on a physical <b>activity</b> <b>statement.</b> Measurements of the thickness of the abdominal muscles at rest and during abdominal drawing-in manoeuvre were made in the supine and standing positions by ultrasound imaging. ResultsCompared to the control group, activities of the obliquus internus and transversus abdominis muscles were higher in the {{regular physical activity}} group by 8. 9 % (95 %CI 3. 10 – 14. 7) and 36 % (95 %CI 19. 1 – 47. 5), respectively. In the regular physical activity group, the transversus abdominis preferential activation ratio was greater by 0. 03 (95 %CI 0. 01 – 0. 04), and the contraction ratio was greater by a mean value of 0. 35 (95 %CI 0. 18 – 0. 46). ConclusionRegular physical activity does not have any effect on the resting thickness of the abdominal muscles in the supine and standing positions.
