40|$|Average {{velocities}} of Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers (West Antarctica) {{were measured}} {{for the time}} periods between 1992 and 1994 by tracking ice-surface patterns. Velocities of the central flow of the Pine Island glacier range from 1. 5 km/yr <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounding</b> line (separating <b>the</b> <b>grounded</b> from <b>the</b> floating parts of a glacier) to 2. 8 km/yr near the terminus; velocities of the central Thwaites glacier range from 2. 2 km/yr <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounding</b> line to 3. 4 km/yr at the limit of measurements on the tongue. Both glaciers show an increase in velocity of about 1 km/yr where they cross their <b>grounding</b> lines. <b>The</b> velocities derived from ERS- 1 images are higher than those previously derived from Landsat images, perhaps reflecting acceleration of the glaciers.

5|$|Davis {{started a}} {{pineapple}} plantation on Key Biscayne; six acres (two-and-a-half hectares) {{had been cleared}} and planted in pineapples in 1893–94. Davis also directed his caretaker to plant one-half to one acre (two-tenths to four-tenths of a hectare) of bananas. By 1898, {{a great variety of}} tropical fruit trees had been planted on the island. Davis also had a large dwelling built for his use. It was a two-story cottage with five bedrooms and verandas on three sides, raised ten feet <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> on pilings to protect against storm surges.|$|E

5|$|Pied currawongs are {{generally}} tree-dwelling, hunting and foraging some metres <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and thus {{able to share}} territory with the ground-foraging Australian magpie. Birds roost in forested areas or large trees at night, disperse to forage {{in the early morning}} and return in the late afternoon. Although often solitary or encountered in small groups, the species may form larger flocks of fifty or more birds in autumn and winter. On the ground, a pied currawong hops or struts.|$|E

40|$|Ice thickness, {{computed}} {{within the}} fjord region of Byrd Glacier on the assumptions that Byrd Glacier is in mass-bahnee equilibrium and that ice velocity is entirely due to basal sliding, are on average 400 m less than measured thicknesses along a radio-echo proffie. We consider four explanations for these differences: (1) active glacier ice {{is separated from}} a zone of stagnant ice near {{the base of the}} glacier by a shear zone at depth; (2) basal melting rates are some 8 m/yr; (3) internal shear occurs with no basal sliding in much of <b>the</b> region <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounding</b> zone; or (4) internal creep and basal sliding contribute to the flow velocity in varying proportions <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounding</b> zone. Large gradients of surface strain rate seem to invalidate the fu'st explanation. Computed values of basal shear stress (140 to 200 kPa) provide insufficient frictional heat o melt the ice demanded by the second explanation. Both the third and fourth explanations were examined by making simplifying assumptions that prevented a truly quantitative valuation of theix merit. Nevertheless, there is n...|$|R
