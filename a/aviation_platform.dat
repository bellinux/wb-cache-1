40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere {{is a critical}} shortfall in dedicated special operations aviation support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organizations (NATO) special operations forces (SOF). One way this shortfall can be addressed is through the procurement and sustainment of an organic NATO SOF Air Wing. In 2006, NATOs Heads of State and Governments endorsed the NATO Special Operations Forces Transformation Initiative, creating what would eventually become the NATO Special Operations Headquarters (NSHQ). NSHQ coordinates, trains, and employs NATOs special operations forces. These forces have proven invaluable in fighting asymmetric threats due to their light, lean, and agile construct, and their versatile projection of high-impact tactics, techniques, and procedures that create strategic effects. The research in this study examines NSHQs requirement for an organic Air Wing and proposes the optimal mix of <b>aviation</b> <b>platforms</b> to support NATO SOF. This optimal mix contains rotary-wing and fixed-wing <b>aviation</b> <b>platforms,</b> as well as intelligence, surveillance, targeting, and reconnaissance aircraft. This research also examines NSHQs training and readiness organizational structure, and proposes changes based {{on the development of}} an organic Air Wing. Dedicated special operations aviation support to NATO special operations forces will greatly enhance the capabilities and mission success of NATO SOF in addressing emerging security challenges.

Analogy can be used when an impasse is reached to extend the deductive closure of EBL’s domain theory.

This advantage addresses a problem which represents a dearth in the current literature. Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) literature has thus far been concerned with the architectural considerations. This paper seeks to address the impact of hardware changes on the controllers within an IMA architecture.

40|$|Includes {{supplementary}} material. This report {{outlines the}} results of a two quarter Total Ship Systems Engineering (TSSE) Capstone design project undertaken by the students at the Naval Postgraduate School. The project was under the direction of Professors C. N. Calvano and R. Harney. Currently, no system exists that provides a sea-based distributed <b>aviation</b> <b>platform</b> capability. The emergence of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) / Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles (UCAVs), the continued U. S. Navy focus on the littorals, the desire for force distribution, the need for operational cost reductions, and the advent of Network Centric Warfare (NCW) all continue to support the requirement to re-evaluate how littoral operations will be conducted in the future. Given this background, a bottom-up design of a ship supporting a primarily UAV/UCAV air wing in a low to medium threat environment is of significant interest. SEA ARCHER meets this interest. This report outlines a design that meets the future needs for distributed aviation with a high-speed, highly automated platform. Large gains in reduced manning through automated systems for both operation and damage control helpmeet the demanding needs {{for the future of the}} Navy at reduced operational costs. The report will outline both the Mission Needs Statement (MNS) and Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the ship that was developed. The analysis of alternatives that was conducted to determine relative size requirements for the ship in presented in the next section.

Their success on battlefields in Afghanistan, Iraq, and around the globe has driven demand {{for a variety of}} types of unmanned vehicles. Their proven value consists in low risk and low cost, and their capabilities include persistent surveillance, tactical and combat reconnaissance, resilience, and dynamic re-tasking. This research evaluates past, current, and possible future operating environments for several UAV platforms to survey the changing dynamics of combat-aviation tactics and make recommendations regarding UAV employment scenarios to the Turkish military. While UAVs have already established their importance in military operations, ongoing evaluations of UAV operating environments, capabilities, technologies, concepts, and organizational issues inform the development of future systems. To what extent will UAV capabilities increasingly define tomorrow's missions, requirements, and results in surveillance and combat tactics? Integrating UAVs and concepts of operations (CONOPS) on future battlefields is an emergent science.

30|$|In conclusion, {{recent studies}} [33, 34] {{proposed}} that doping oxide nanoparticles into a molten salt eutectic can induce salt molecules {{to form a}} fractal-like nanostructure on a nanoparticle and thus enhance the effective specific heat of the molten salt eutectic. This {{is due to a}} unique feature of molten salt eutectics since salt molecules are likely to electrostatically interact with oxide nanoparticles and settle down on their surfaces to form a nanostructure. Hence, such nanostructural formation can occur only in molten salt media, and thus, such specific heat enhancement of fluid is only naturally possible in molten salt media. In this study, we demonstrated that such nanostructures can be mimicked through in situ formation of fabricated superstructures, constructed by nanoparticles coated with pre-fabricated nanostructures (i.e., hydroxy-ended poly (polyethylene-block-poly) (MW ca. 1400), termed as “PBP”). We first applied this approach to polyalphaolefin (PAO), which is a well-known non-polar thermal fluid in <b>aviation</b> <b>platforms</b> and radar systems. A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was employed to characterize specific heat. Since these structure formations can also increase thermal conductivity and viscosity like nanofluids, these properties were also investigated. Results showed 44.5, 19.8, and 22.5 % of specific heat, thermal conductivity, and viscosity enhancement, respectively, in comparison with pure PAO. In addition, the enhancements in specific heat and thermal conductivity can improve the PAO’s heat storage and transfer performance. However, the viscosity increase may increase the pumping power (negative effect), and thus, it is necessary to evaluate the effect of the proposed in situ synthesis of superstructure in PAO {{whether or not it is}} useful in thermal fluid applications. Hence, we evaluate its heat storage and transfer performance by using generalized figure of merit analyses. Results show that heat storage and transfer performances can be enhanced by ~ 166 – 177 % and ~ 75 – 98 %, respectively. This is the first demonstration of enhanced specific heat by in situ formation of nanostructure and may provide a new approach to organic molecule modification to the materials science community.|$|R

Total costs throughout a realistic operation and support life cycle and applying a notional scenario to the newest calculator demonstrate a range of cost estimating methods. Our conclusions support previous analysis that air refueling contributes significantly to logistics support costs and that investment in fuel conservation technologies and platform endurance can be a strategic opportunity for the Department of Defense and the Department of the Navy.
