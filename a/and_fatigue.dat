40|$|Abstract. There are coupled {{cases of}} high-cycle <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> low-cycle <b>fatigue</b> in torsion shaft of {{military}} tracked vehicles. To accurately analyze the stochastic fatigue reliability of torsion shaft, {{a new kind}} of decoupling method for high-cycle <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> low-cycle <b>fatigue</b> was firstly put forward. Probability fatigue accumulation damage theory and nominal stress method were combined to analyze high-cycle fatigue. Random response surface method was adopted to fit the life distribution function for low-cycle fatigue. To obtain the high-cycle <b>and</b> low-cycle stochastic <b>fatigue</b> reliability, probability fatigue accumulation damage theory and local stress and strain method were used. Then, composite damages of torsion shaft under high-cycle <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> low-cycle <b>fatigue</b> could be achieved based on probability fatigue accumulation damage thoery. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the influences of load carriage <b>and</b> muscular <b>fatigue</b> on ground reaction forces and ground reaction loading rates during walking. Eighteen healthy males performed the following tasks in order: unloaded and unfatigued walking, loaded <b>and</b> unfatigued walking, <b>fatiguing</b> exercise, loaded <b>and</b> <b>fatigued</b> walking, <b>and</b> unloaded <b>and</b> <b>fatigued</b> walking. The fatiguing exercise consisted of a series of metered step-ups and heel raises with a 16 -kg rucksack. Loaded walking tasks were performed with a 32 -kg rucksack. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variances were used to determine the effects of <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> load carriage on ground reaction forces and loading rates. Muscular fatigue has a significant influence on peak vertical ground reaction force and loading rate (p 3 ̆c 0. 01). Load carriage has a significant influence on peak ground reaction forces and loading rates (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). As both muscular <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> load carriage lead to large increases of ground reaction forces and loading rates, the high incidence of lower extremity overuse injuries in the military may be associated with muscular <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> load carriage...|$|R

Following the SPD process, samples were subjected to heat treatment (HT), hard anodizing (HA), and a combination of HT and HA. Rotating–bending fretting fatigue tests were performed to explore the samples’ response to the fretting condition. From the experimental <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> fretting <b>fatigue</b> tests, {{it was apparent that}} the SPD treatment had a positive effect on enhancing the <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> fretting <b>fatigue</b> lives of the samples at low and high-cyclic loads compared with the HT technique by 78 and 67 pct, and 131 and 154 pct respectively. The results also indicate that the SPD + HT technique significantly increased the <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> fretting <b>fatigue</b> lives of the samples at high and low cycles by 15. 56 and 8. 33 pct, and 14. 4 and 5. 1 pct respectively, compared with the SPD method. HA of AA 6063 increased the <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> fretting <b>fatigue</b> lives of SPD + HT-processed samples at low cycle by 15. 5 and 18. 4 pct respectively; however, at high cycle, HA had reverse effects, whereby the <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> fretting <b>fatigue</b> lives of SPD + HT-processed samples decreased by 16. 7 and 30 pct, respectively.

5|$|Air {{compression}} on {{the outer}} surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch {{by the end of}} the flight. Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the nose, due to aerodynamic heating. The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02. Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical <b>and</b> <b>fatigue</b> modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing. The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.|$|E

5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, <b>and</b> <b>fatigue</b> common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
