500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done.

[...] He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E

40|$|Extract] In {{the past}} decade, {{two-thirds of the}} world's forest {{elephants}} – which live only in Africa's equatorial rainforests – have been slaughtered by poachers for their ivory tusks. Why? One reason is that poachers are now armed with far more lethal technologies than they once had. Instead of arrows and spears, they now have powerful rifles and cable snares. But <b>an</b> even <b>bigger</b> <b>reason</b> is that, since the year 2000, more than 50, 000 kilometres of roads have been bulldozed into the Congo Basin, mostly by industrial loggers, opening up the region to waves of commercial and subsistence hunters. The elephants simply have nowhere left to hide. This scene of ecological invasion is being repeated over and over, all around the world.

40|$|The use and {{sustainability}} of miombo woodlands under community management was studied in north eastern Zimbabwe using Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) methods. The study especially focussed on benefits obtained from miombo woodlands, their seasonal variability and long-term changes of woodland {{resources in the}} Mangwende communal area so as to assess the sustainability of communal management of forest land in the study area. Like farmers everywhere in Southern Africa, people in the study region are largely dependent on resources found on communal and state owned lands. In the study area, communal woodlands were found to provide a large variety of benefits for local people, especially important during dry seasons, e. g. poles, fibre and thatching grasses, firewood, fodder and traditional medicines. Despite the rich variety of products, the availability of woodland resources has dramatically diminished during the last 30 years. This trend, {{which is expected to}} continue, has forced people to use manufactured substitutes, e. g. for medicinal, nutritional and heating purposes. Most of the few forested areas left in the region are heavily degraded, but still continuously under over-utilisation. Based on the collected data, it was evident that community management has not helped the environment to survive the increased land use pressure brought about by a growing population in the study area. It is, however, too simplistic to assume that community management has directly caused environmental degradation. In the case of forest cover loss, for example, population pressure has probably been <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>reason</b> for deforestation than failures in land management...|$|R

5000|$|Due {{to their}} win over USC, {{it was widely}} assumed UCLA would get the Rose Bowl berth.

This vote deprived Prothro of being the first coach to earn three consecutive Rose Bowl berths and UCLA athletic director J.D.

If there was still a tie, the Rose Bowl berth would go to the team that had not played in the Rose Bowl the longest. But it was too late for UCLA.
