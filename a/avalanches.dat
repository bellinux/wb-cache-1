Uniform practices for evaluation of <b>avalanche</b> risk and facility planning should result in reduced loss oflife and property damage. Risk determination under the Canadian Guidelines includes <b>avalanche</b> return period, the probable consequences of an <b>avalanche</b> and probable exposure to the <b>avalanche.</b> Consequences are defmed by predicted <b>avalanche</b> impact pressure or destructive potential based on the five part Canadian system for classifying <b>avalanche</b> size...|$|R

5|$|Wet snow <b>avalanches</b> are a low-velocity {{suspension}} {{of snow and}} water, with the flow confined {{to the surface of}} the pathway.

Securing the equipment compatibility of <b>avalanche</b> search devices is another focus. Furthermore, the ICAR <b>Avalanche</b> Rescue Commission played a dominant role in the unification of the European <b>avalanche</b> danger scale. Currently, these efforts are extended to harmonize the European <b>avalanche</b> danger scale with the North American systems.The ICAR <b>Avalanche</b> Rescue Commission also provides information on <b>avalanche</b> accidents. The average number of annual <b>avalanche</b> accident fatalities in the Alps is 106. This is calculated from a 20-year record of fatal <b>avalanche</b> accidents in the alpine countries. Adding the number of the fatal accidents in North America, the average is 138. Most victims released the <b>avalanche</b> themselves during skiing or hiking in backcountry terrain. However, a significant number of people died while they were skiing or snowboarding off-piste or snowmobiling in the backcountry. For the latter groups, the annual numbers of fatal accidents are slightly increasing.There are two technical sub-commissions within the ICAR <b>Avalanche</b> Rescue Commission: Dog-Handlers and Prevention.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In any country, {{the process}} of {{establishing}} a community aimed at <b>avalanche</b> safety and {{the characteristics of the}} community are influenced a great deal by the social system, the culture, the business practice in the local recreation industry and the characteristic of the users.

In that process, JAN launched its own information sharing system on the internet, “Snow BBS (snow condition bulletin board), ” and have utilized the system as a tool for information sharing and <b>avalanche</b> education.

25|$|When a slab <b>avalanche</b> forms, {{the slab}} disintegrates into {{increasingly}} smaller fragments {{as the snow}} travels downhill.

When sufficiently fine particles are present they can become airborne and, given a sufficient quantity of airborne snow, this portion of the <b>avalanche</b> can become separated from the bulk of the <b>avalanche</b> and travel a greater distance as a powder snow <b>avalanche.</b> Scientific studies using radar, following the 1999 Galtür <b>avalanche</b> disaster, confirmed the hypothesis that a saltation layer forms between the surface and the airborne components of an <b>avalanche,</b> which can also separate from the bulk of the <b>avalanche.</b>|$|R

5|$|Since I Left You is {{the debut}} studio album by the <b>Avalanches.</b> They started {{recording}} in 1999 and {{had used the}} working title of Pablo's Cruise. The duo primarily worked with a Yamaha Promix 01 and Akai S2000 samplers. The band's members, Darren Seltmann and Robbie Chater, spent hours sampling music from vinyl records to create the songs on the album: Chater estimates that there are over 3,500 samples. After sampling and arranging, the pair would swap their tapes, listen to each other's ideas and expand on whatever they had heard. Despite working separately, both Chater and Seltmann had nearly identical studio set-ups.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Snow <b>avalanche</b> danger {{assessment}} for <b>avalanche</b> paths threatening a highway or a residential area is usually related to new snow depth. Given the extensive protection {{work in the}} Alps, the <b>avalanche</b> control service (also called <b>avalanche</b> commission) responsible for danger assessment will usually monitor the <b>avalanche</b> situation throughout the winter, but only become active {{in case of a}} major snow fall. Related safety concepts describing the procedures and measures to be taken in a given danger situation are therefore typically based on threshold values for new snow. By analysing the <b>avalanche</b> occurrence of a major <b>avalanche</b> path, we show that the return period of an <b>avalanche</b> to, for example, the road is about 5 years, whereas the return period for the corresponding new snow depth is substantially smaller, in our case slightly less than 2 years. Similar proportions were found for a number of other <b>avalanche</b> paths with different snow climate. The return period of the critical new snow depth is typically about 2 - 5 times smaller than the return period of the <b>avalanche.</b> This proportion is expected to increase with increasing return period. Hence, based on the return period of an <b>avalanche</b> path a first estimate for the critical new snow depth can be made. With a return period of the critical new snow depth of 1 - 2 years, <b>avalanche</b> prediction for individual <b>avalanche</b> path becomes very challenging since the false alarm ratio is expected to be high...|$|R

Recent instrumentation developments now provide rich-documented in situ measurements of <b>avalanche</b> flow. 20 cm-resolution vertical profiles of pressure and velocity get inside into the internal structure of snow flows with a time sampling rate of 3 kHz. In complement to this Eulerian measurement, the Lagrangian velocity of the <b>avalanche</b> front is measured along the track by digital high-speed stereo-photogrammetry. This remote sensing system also provides the initial surface and volume conditions in the starting zone.
