5|$|We love, obviously, to do provocative imagery... {{we always}} try to {{definitely}} push the limits... I think because, in the end, it's not really at all <b>about</b> <b>domestic</b> violence. It's really just about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and that definitely plays a part, but I think it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting that out of her life. The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot of harm.|$|E

25|$|Carmel Jackson (also Roberts) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Judith Jacob from 5 June 1986 to 24 August 1989. Carmel, a Health Visitor, was initially introduced in a recurring, minor role in 1986. Producers saw {{potential in the}} character, and script writers were asked to develop more prominent storylines, and Carmel became a regular character. She is portrayed as a well-meaning, caring individual who is forever getting everyone's problems dumped on her. She is featured in storylines <b>about</b> <b>domestic</b> violence and various family and career upsets. Jacob remained in the role until 1989, when she opted to leave.

25|$|Domestic {{violence}} in Chile {{is a serious}} issue affecting {{a large percentage of}} the population, especially among lower income demographics. The Intrafamily Violence Law passed in 1994 was the first political measure to address {{violence in}} the home, but because the law would not pass without being accepted by both sides, the law was weak in the way it addressed victim protection and punishment for abusers. The law was later reformed in 2005. A 2004 SERNAM study reported that 50 percent of married women in Chile had suffered spousal abuse, 34 percent reported having suffered physical violence, and 16 percent reported psychological abuse. According to another study from 2004, 90 percent of low-income women in Chile experience some type of domestic violence. Due to the high prevalence of domestic violence, many Chilean women accept it as normal. The legalization of divorce in 2004 won the approval of women throughout the country, especially those concerned <b>about</b> <b>domestic</b> violence, as women were previously unable to escape abusive relationships due to the divorce laws.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, contradictions {{have arisen}} in the {{discussion}} of King's criticisms. The author once suggested that he disliked the film's downplaying of the supernatural; King had envisioned Jack as a victim of the genuinely external forces haunting the hotel, whereas King felt Kubrick had viewed the haunting and its resulting malignancy as coming from within Jack himself. In October 2013, however, journalist Laura Miller wrote that the discrepancy between the two was almost the complete opposite: the Jack Torrance of the novel was corrupted by his own choices – particularly alcoholism – whereas in Kubrick's adaptation the causes are actually more surreal and ambiguous:King is, essentially, a novelist of morality. The decisions his characters make — whether it’s to confront a pack of vampires or to break 10 years of sobriety — are what matter to him. But in Kubrick’s The Shining, the characters are largely in the grip of forces beyond their control. It’s a film in which domestic violence occurs, while King’s novel is <b>about</b> <b>domestic</b> violence as a choice certain men make when they refuse to abandon a delusional, defensive entitlement. As King sees it, Kubrick treats his characters like “insects” because the director doesn’t really consider them capable of shaping their own fates. Everything they do is subordinate to an overweening, irresistible force, which is Kubrick’s highly developed aesthetic; they are its slaves. In King’s “The Shining”, the monster is Jack. In Kubrick’s, the monster is Kubrick.|$|E
25|$|While Njegoš was in Vienna and Russia in 1833, Vukotić took {{advantage}} of the vladikas prolonged absence to increase his own power. Njegoš quickly moved to push Vukotić aside, installing his own brother Pero as senate leader and their cousin Đorđije—who had recently returned from Saint Petersburg—as Pero's deputy. Vukotić and Vučićević were exiled to Russia. There, they spread countless rumours about Njegoš in an attempt to tarnish his reputation. While their actions threatened to ruin his image abroad, Njegoš was far more concerned <b>about</b> <b>domestic</b> discontent with his tax policies. He reasoned that his pious and overly superstitious citizens would not protest taxation as fiercely if the Petrovićes boasted a saint who was of the same bloodline. Hence, he arranged for the canonization of the late Petar I on the fourth anniversary of his death, in October 1834. With a saint in his family, Njegoš could now threaten any Montenegrin who challenged his authority with spiritual sanctions. Most Montenegrins were greatly enthusiastic about Petar's canonization, and many flocked to his tomb in Cetinje to celebrate the event. While Njegoš was now in a more stable position than he was two years earlier, he still encountered several challenges to his rule. He was criticized for allegedly misappropriating the funds given to him by the Russians, and a tribal rebellion in Crmnica and Riječka nahiya erupted in response to the demands of tax collectors and chronic food shortages. The revolt was crushed by Njegoš's cousins Đorđije and Stanko, but the allegations of fund misappropriation further tarnished his reputation among the Russians.|$|E

[...] He went on to criticize it for its tone, noting [...] "An episode like this only works if the bits of comedy surrounding the serious plot create contrast to the darker main story, but they weren't here." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard {{admitted}} {{his initial}} {{fears of the}} portrayal because {{he felt it was}} a taboo subject. He had difficulties portraying it initially, this was because he was not familiar with the subject. [...] "The storyline had not been tackled in British soap opera before and Richardson felt Ste was [...] "making television history". He then explained how the storyline differs from other soap operas because [...] "Ste doesn't question his sexuality and it's not about a struggle — it's <b>about</b> <b>domestic</b> abuse in a gay relationship." [...] Richardson also stated because of the plots dark nature, he hoped viewers would be [...] "drawn into it". He branded the storyline as unpredictable because viewers never know if Brendan was going kiss or hit Ste.|$|E

500|$|The poem's seventy {{lines of}} blank verse are {{presented}} as a dramatic monologue. Scholars disagree on how Ulysses' speech functions in this format; {{it is not necessarily}} clear to whom Ulysses is speaking, if anyone, and from what location. Some see the verse turning from a soliloquy to a public address, as Ulysses seems to speak to himself in the first movement, then to turn to an audience as he introduces his son, and then to relocate to the seashore where he addresses his mariners. In this interpretation, the comparatively direct and honest language of the first movement is set against the more politically minded tone of the last two movements. For example, the second paragraph (33–43) about Telemachus, in which Ulysses muses again <b>about</b> <b>domestic</b> life, is a [...] "revised version [...] for public consumption": a [...] "savage race" [...] is revised to a [...] "rugged people".|$|E
500|$|Stewart {{approached}} the project with gusto, remarking that he [...] "wrote an adaptation from {{a novel that}} tells about the fascist mice who are nibbling away at our country while we're busy fighting a good war". Stewart believed Hollywood had punished him for years for his political views, and felt vindicated by the assignment, declaring that [...] "here was my compensation for the sabotage of my radical attempt to do my bit...". The script was the proudest moment of his entire career. Stewart, however, had extensive problems adapting the novel for the screen, and filming—originally due to begin in June 1942—was delayed for several months while {{he worked on the}} screenplay. He consulted with the Bureau of Motion Pictures in the U.S. Office of War Information, an agency of the federal government created in June 1942 to promote patriotism and warn the public <b>about</b> <b>domestic</b> spying.|$|E
