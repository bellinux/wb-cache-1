I examine the political and economic factors in source countries that generate refugees and asylum seekers. Particular attention is given to the rising trend of asylum applications up to the 1990 s, and the policy backlash that followed. I consider the political economy of restrictive asylum policies, especially in EU countries, as well as the effectiveness of those policies in deterring asylum seekers. The paper concludes with an outline of the <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>refugees</b> in host country labour markets. Refugees; Asylum Migration; Asylum Policy...|$|E
40|$|We {{argue that}} spatial {{dispersal}} policies on refugees and asylum seekers influence labour market <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>refugees</b> through two mechanisms: first, the local job offer arrival rate and, second, place utility. Our partial search model with simultaneous job and residential location search {{predicts that the}} reservation wage for local jobs decreases with place utility. We argue that spatial dispersal decreases average place utility of refugees which decreases the transition rate into first job due to large local reservation wages. We investigate both mechanisms empirically and test the predictions of the theoretical model by evaluating the employment effects of the Danish spatial dispersal policy carried out 1986 - 1998.

40|$|The <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>refugees</b> {{into their}} host {{community}} economic structures is often problematic. The paper investigates {{the ability of}} refugees in rural South Africa to accumulate assets over time relative to their host community. Bayesian spatial temporal modeling was employed to analyze a longitudinal database that indicated the asset accumulation rate of former refugee households was similar to their host community, however, {{they were unable to}} close the wealth gap. A series of geo-statistical wealth maps illustrate that there is a spatial element to the higher levels of absolute poverty in the former refugee villages. The primary reason for this is their physical location in drier conditions that are established further away from facilities and infrastructure. Neighboring South African villages in close proximity, however, display lower levels of absolute poverty suggesting that the spatial location of the refugees only partially explains their disadvantaged situation. In this regard, the results indicate that the wealth of former refugee households continues to be more compromised by comparatively by higher mortality levels, poorer education and less access to high return employment opportunities. The long term impact of low initial asset status appears to be perpetuated in this instance by difficulties in obtaining legal status in order to access state pensions, facilities and opportunities. The usefulness of the results is that they can be used to sharpen the targeting of differentiated policy in a given geographical area for refugee communities in rural Africa. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|This thesis empirically investigates three {{different}} aspects of immigration policies in Germany. In Chapter 2, I analyze whether the economic <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>refugees</b> differs from the assimilation of economic immigrants. To create and implement effective immigration policies, {{it is necessary to}} understand the heterogeneity of different immigration groups. As a large part of low-skilled immigrants in the OECD originates from asylum seekers and low-skilled immigrants are a main target of immigration policies, a deeper understanding of that group is of high relevance. Moreover, immigration via the asylum system will most likely present an important channel for immigration in the future, given events like the recent refugee crisis in the European Union. If immigration policy tries to improve the economic integration of refugees, the peculiarities of the group of refugees should be taken into account designing policy measures. Chapters 3 and 4 analyze the effects of a particular policy instrument, the acquisition of citizenship. Naturalization grants an immigrant the citizenship of the host country by giving the immigrant the equal rights as the native population. It is predominantly directed to immigrants who have spent several years in the host country and requires specific criteria to be met. The third chapter which is joint work with Christina Gathmann investigates the effect of citizenship acquisition on the economic integration of immigrants. Making use of a novel identification strategy which is based on two policy reforms, we identify the causal effect of citizenship on various economic outcomes. An earlier version of this paper was circulated in the IZA Working Paper series (Gathmann and Keller, 2014). The fourth paper which is joint work with Christina Gathmann and Ole Monscheuer broadens the scope on the effects of citizenship acquisition and analyzes the impact of naturalization on the social integration of immigrants. In particular, we investigate the effects of naturalization on fertility and marriage patterns of immigrants. Despite the primary interest in the labor market effects of immigration policies, these policies might also have significant impact on other dimensions of integration. Previous research has shown that attitudes of natives toward immigrants and immigration in general are not only shaped by their economic impacts (i. e., on wages and taxes), but also on social and cultural differences (e. g., Card et al., 2012; Dustmann and Preston, 2007). Thus, the effects of immigration policies on social integration outcomes are also highly relevant, especially for policy makers which are confined by the public perception of immigration in general...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the Palestinian refugees’ {{experience}} in Lebanon since 1948, to critically engage with Agamben’s theory of exception. Agamben conceives of the ‘camp’ as the space where the normal juridical order and the inhabitants’ rights are suspended, the hidden matrix of the modern where the sovereign confronts nothing but bare life. Refugees are framed as the ultimate embodiment of bare life, a life stripped of rights and protection and {{at the mercy of}} state authorities. This research critiques this understanding in three ways. Firstly, by disenfranchising the concept of sovereign power from statehood, I adopt a multiscalar approach to uncover the complex network of sovereigns and decisions impacting upon the Palestinian life. From the international level (UN and humanitarian organisations) to the regional level (Arab states and Lebanon), I discuss the roles and responsibility of multiple actors in the production of Palestinian bare life showing the global scope of sovereign power. Secondly, by disengaging the concept of power from political institutions, I include the Palestinian refugees’ agency in the chessboard of power relations. Focusing on lived experiences and critically engaging with state-centric and law-centric perspectives, the thesis uncovers the micropolitics on the ground constituted by multiple forms <b>of</b> resistance that <b>refugees</b> adopt in their ongoing struggles for survival and recognition. The recognition of this agency and political significance of refugees’ lives is paramount if a just solution to the Palestinian refugee question is to be found. Finally, this study interrogates and problematises the uncritical <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> camps to spaces of exception. By looking at the evolution <b>of</b> Shatila <b>refugee</b> camp and its relation to the city of Beirut, I discuss the formation of a new spatial model that I call ‘campscape’. As social and spatial boundaries increasingly blur, the ‘campscape’, which includes the refugee camp and informal settlements around, is the space in which the refugee meets the other outcasts of the Lebanese political and economic system. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the educational attainment of Southeast Asian immigrants, specifically Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Hmong, to explicate their diversity within the racial category, “Asian American”. Over 1 million Hmong refugees and immigrants {{arrived in the}} United States from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos {{following the end of}} the Vietnam War. This broad pan-ethnic label is particularly detrimental to Southeast Asian ethnic minorities because of the model minority stereotype ascribed to them. This stereotype renders ethnic groups categorized under the “Asian American” identity term from being considered for social and educational programs that they may otherwise benefit from (Hurh 2 ̆ 6 Kim, 1989, S.

Studies have examined the educational attainment of Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Hmong students but none have used empirical evidence with Bourdieu’s cultural capital theory to explain the disparity of educational attainment among varying Asian ethnicities.
