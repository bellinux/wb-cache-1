25|$|Higher {{education}} in Ontario includes postsecondary education and skills training {{regulated by the}} Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities and provided by universities, colleges of applied arts and technology, and private career colleges. The minister is Reza Moridi. The ministry administers laws covering 22 public universities, 24 public colleges (21 Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology (CAATs) and three Institutes of Technology and Advanced Learning (ITALs)), 17 privately funded religious universities, and over 500 private career colleges. The Canadian constitution provides each province with the responsibility for higher education {{and there is no}} corresponding national federal ministry of higher education. Within Canadian federalism the division of responsibilities and taxing powers between the Ontario and Canadian governments creates the need for co-operation to fund and deliver higher education to students. Each higher education system aims to improve participation, access, and mobility for students. There are two central organizations that assist with the process of applying to Ontario universities and colleges: the Ontario Universities' Application Centre and Ontario College <b>Application</b> <b>Service.</b> While application services are centralized, admission and selection processes vary and are the purview of each institution independently. Admission to many Ontario postsecondary institutions can be highly competitive. Upon admission, students may get involved with regional student representation with the Canadian Federation of Students, the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance, or through the College Student Alliance in Ontario.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the OSIRIS middleware (Open Service Infrastructure for Reliable and Integrated process Support) which allows combining different distributed services into processes, thereby implementing flexible digital library applications. In OSIRIS, we distinguish between system <b>services</b> and <b>application</b> <b>services.</b> System services are used internally for coordinating {{the execution of}} processes in a distributed way, without relying on a central execution engine/scheduler. In addition, the distributed architecture of OSIRIS allows for reliable peer-to-peer process management and sophisticated failure handling according to the transactional process model {{and is able to}} balance the load among several providers of the same <b>service.</b> For <b>application</b> <b>services,</b> we distinguish between loosely coupled and tightly coupled services. Usually, a part of the distributed OSIRIS middleware (called OSIRIS layer) runs on each host providing <b>application</b> <b>services.</b> These <b>application</b> <b>services</b> are considered as tightly coupled since, in case information on their transactional properties like compensation or re-invocation (retriability) is available, dedicated transactional guarantees for processes can be provided. Loosely-coupled <b>application</b> <b>services</b> are those that have to be called remotely, without a local ORISIS layer available. The integration/invocation is done via WSDL for service description and SOAP for invocation. The core of OSIRIS has bee...|$|R

2500|$|In February 2007, MMC hit {{a crisis}} {{caused by the}} abject failure of its online job-matching component: the Medical Training <b>Application</b> <b>Service</b> (MTAS). This led to loud {{criticism}} from within the medical profession that culminated in senior surgeons in Birmingham refusing to interview candidates recommended to them by MTAS. In response, the Department of Health announced an urgent review led by the Vice-Chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, Professor Neil Douglas. But when the review group declared that MTAS should continue, it triggered mass demonstrations by junior doctors; the London protest march was addressed by the Leader of the Opposition at the time, David Cameron, who described MTAS as [...] "an utter shambles". Over the following weeks and months, there was a flurry of resignations of senior doctors associated with MMC, MTAS and the Douglas Review itself.|$|E
2500|$|Poor speech {{habits and}} other {{problems}} such as heavy foreign accents and mumbling complicate the process for both the MT and the recognition software. An MT can [...] "flag" [...] such a report as unintelligible, but the recognition software will transcribe the unintelligible word(s) from the existing database of [...] "learned" [...] language. The result is often a [...] "word salad" [...] or missing text. Thresholds can be set to reject a bad report and return it for standard dictation, but these settings are arbitrary. Below a set percentage rate, the word salad passes for actual dictation. The MT simultaneously listens, reads and [...] "edits" [...] the correct version. Every word must be confirmed in this process. The downside of the technology is when the time spent in this process cancels out the benefits. The quality of recognition can range from excellent to poor, with whole words and sentences missing from the report. Not infrequently, negative contractions and the word [...] "not" [...] is dropped altogether. These flaws trigger concerns that the present technology could have adverse effects on patient care. Control over quality can also be reduced when providers choose a server-based program from a vendor <b>Application</b> <b>Service</b> Provider (ASP).|$|E
