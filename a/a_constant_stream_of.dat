5|$|Patrolling by the Australians {{continued}} {{in order to}} prevent the Chinese from harassing their forward positions. Small clashes occurred on the nights of 15/16, 21/22, 22/23 and 23/24 July, suggesting that the Chinese were preparing for a major attack. Aerial reconnaissance subsequently detected a build up of Chinese forces and supplies west of the Samichon River. In response the Australians and US Marines stepped up their defensive preparations, {{while at the same time}} rumours from the peace talks started to spread of a ceasefire. Regardless, Chinese harassing artillery and mortar fire intensified, causing <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> casualties among the Australians. Intense Chinese shelling struck Hill 121 and The Hook on the night of 19/20 July, with more than 300 rounds wounding four members of C Company, 2 RAR and further damaging the defences. That night the US Marines were driven off the Berlin and East Berlin features on the left flank, further exposing The Hook, which became a salient. Yet on 21 July an expected Chinese assault in the US 5th Marine Regiment sector failed to occur, while sightings of Chinese troops across the US 1st Marine Division front declined as the fighting entered a lull.|$|E

However, severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the cofferdam {{and all of}} the construction site's bridges, putting work a month behind schedule. Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of impervious material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered <b>an</b> almost <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> dirt and rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate of one and a half feet (0.5 m) per day.

25|$|Grant faced two Confederate armies in his campaign: the Vicksburg garrison, {{commanded}} by Maj. Gen. John C. Pemberton, and forces in Jackson, {{commanded by}} Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, the overall theater commander. Rather than simply heading directly {{north to the}} city, Grant chose to cut the line of communications (and reinforcement) between the two Confederate armies. His army headed swiftly northeast toward Jackson. Meanwhile, Grant brought with him a limited supply line. The conventional history of the campaign indicates that he cut loose from all of his supplies, perplexing Pemberton, who attempted to interdict his nonexistent lines at Raymond on May 12. In reality, Grant relied on the local economy to provide him only foodstuffs for men and animals, but there was <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> wagons carrying ammunition, coffee, hardtack, salt, and other supplies for his army.|$|E

There are several pilgrimage narratives that chronicle the journey to Mount Sinai, most notably those of John Mandeville and Friar Felix Fabri. However, the monastery at Mount Sinai was the best-known site of Catherine pilgrimage, but was also {{the most difficult to}} reach. The most prominent Western shrine was the monastery in Rouen that claimed to house Catherine's fingers. It was not alone in the west, however, accompanied by many, scattered shrines and altars dedicated to Catherine, which existed throughout France and England. Some were better known sites, such as Canterbury and Westminster, which claimed a phial of her oil, brought back from Mount Sinai by Edward the Confessor. Other shrines, such as St. Catherine's Hill, Hampshire were the focus of generally local pilgrimage, many of which are only identified by brief mentions in various texts, rather than by physical evidence.|$|E

In order to assure survival, these companies show a rapid product innovation. However, for commodity derivatives the risk of failure is considerable. This paper presents a new and integrative approach towards commodity derivatives management, which makes it easier to gain insight into the viability of new commodity derivatives before introduction, to assess and improve the viability of existing commodity derivatives and to provide the managers of the financial services industry with information about the tools they can use in the product development process of commodity derivatives. published or submitted for publicationnot peer reviewe...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{extensive}} restrictions, limitations, and hardships, Decembrists {{believed that}} they could improve their situation through personal initiative. <b>A</b> <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> petitions came out of Petrovsky Zavod addressed to General Leparskii and Emperor Nicholas I. Most of the petitions were written by Decembrists’ wives who had nobly cast aside social privileges and comfort to follow their husbands into exile. These wives joined {{under the leadership of}} Princess Mariia Volkonskaia, and by 1832, through relentless petitions, managed to secure for their men formal cancellation of labor requirements, and several privileges, including the right of husbands to live with their wives in privacy. Decembrists managed to gain transfers and allowances through persuasive petitions as well as through the intervention of family members. This process of petitioning, and the resultant concessions made by the tsar and officials, was and would continue to be a standard practice of political exiles in Siberia. The chain of bureaucratic procedures and orders linking St. Petersburg to Siberian administration was often circumvented or ignored. These breaks in bureaucracy afforded exiles a small capacity for betterment and activism.|$|E

The experimental tests were conducted using an innovative hydraulic satellite motor, that is dedicated to work with different liquids, including water.
