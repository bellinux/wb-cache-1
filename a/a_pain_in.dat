He died in Beirut on 30 June. According to Syrian historian Sami Moubayed, Quwatli died after learning of the defeat of the Syrian and Arab armies. The Ba'athist-dominated government refused to allow Quwatli's body to be buried in Damascus and only relented after diplomatic pressure from King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. An honorary funeral organized by the state was held for him on 1 July.|$|E

It included a song from Poventud Una Pena en La Navidad. (<b>A</b> <b>Pain</b> <b>in</b> Christmas).|$|E

25|$|Early {{symptoms}} are malaise and lethargy. Even earlier might be <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> {{a section of}} the gums which interferes with digestion. After 1–3 months, patients develop shortness of breath and bone pain. Myalgias may occur because of reduced carnitine production. Other symptoms include skin changes with roughness, easy bruising and petechiae, gum disease, loosening of teeth, poor wound healing, and emotional changes (which may appear before any physical changes). Dry mouth and dry eyes similar to Sjögren's syndrome may occur. In the late stages, jaundice, generalized edema, oliguria, neuropathy, fever, convulsions, and eventual death are frequently seen.|$|E
25|$|At {{his first}} {{competition}} of the season, Skate Canada Autumn Classic International, he received 112.72 points for his short program. Hanyu cleanly executed the quadruple Salchow, the triple Axel and the quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop combination, breaking {{the world record}} he had set previously at the 2015-16 Grand Prix Final (110.95). In this competition, due to <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> his right knee, the quadruple loop jump {{was replaced by the}} quadruple Salchow. During the free skating, Hanyu popped the opening jump into a single Lutz and fell on a triple Axel, which was uncharacteristic for him. He also had troubles with other jumps and his quadruple toe loop was downgraded for a two-footed landing. He got a score of 155.52 points, and was surpassed by Fernández.|$|E

You'd think after 13 years, at the age they are [...] and the amount of bullshit they've been through, they would have learned something! They'd probably have a very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better. [...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you if I thought she was <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> the ass, although sometimes she is <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> the ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E

[...] PedroII wrote in his journal on 28 December 1889: [...] "Hearing the Empress complain I went to see what it was. She is cold with <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> her sides; but she does not have any fever."

500|$|Moore doubletracked his vocals, but {{apart from}} {{occasional}} use of delay did not use any effects on his vocals. He used an Elektron Monomachine and a Minimoog Voyager with computer software to produce the keyboard sounds on the album. Matheos detuned his guitars to C# and sometimes B instead of using a seven-string guitar because he prefers {{the sound of a}} detuned guitar: [...] "To me, they sound totally different if you have those nice loose, floppy strings," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real bitch to keep them in tune, stopping every couple measures, retuning and punching back in. Especially for [...] song that's in B, or even C# is a problem sometimes, especially if you're doing a lot of fast moving around or high up on the neck.

500|$|In 1984, while {{promoting}} the film This Is Spinal Tap, Shearer, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean had a performance on Saturday Night Live. All three members were offered {{the chance to}} join to the show in the 1984–1985 season. Shearer accepted because he was treated well by the producers and he thought the backstage environment had improved but later stated that he [...] "didn't realize that guests are treated better than the regulars." [...] Guest also accepted the offer while McKean rejected it, although he would join the cast in 1994. Dick Ebersol, who replaced Lorne Michaels as the show's producer, said that Shearer was [...] "a gifted performer but <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> the butt. He's just so demanding on the preciseness of things and he's very, very hard on the working people. He's just a nightmare-to-deal-with person." [...] In January 1985, Shearer left the show for good, partially because {{he felt he was}} not being used enough. Martin Short said Shearer [...] "wanted to be creative and Dick [...] wanted something else. [...] I think he felt his voice wasn't getting represented on the show. When he wouldn't get that chance, it made him very upset." ...|$|E
500|$|Bruce MacVittie {{auditioned for}} the role of Larry Biedron by mailing a tape of himself {{performing}} to the show's producers. Yoshimura had previously seen MacVittie perform on the New York City stage and thought that he was a [...] "wonderful, wonderful actor". After watching his rehearsal tape, Yoshimura settled on MacVittie for the part based not only on his acting, but also on his short physical stature. Yoshimura said, [...] "I'm watching this tape and I'm thinking, 'Yeah, this little guy! Who would suspect this little guy to have these murderous kinds of tendencies. Laura MacDonald was also cast as Lange's girlfriend Sarah Flannigan based on an audition tape she sent to the show. Wendee Pratt was cast as emergency medical technician Joy Tolson, who works to help Lange throughout the episode but does not get along with him. Yoshimura said that he particularly enjoyed Pratt's performance [...] "because she's not playing at all sympathetic. This guy's <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> her ass." [...] Shari Elliker, a WBAL (AM) disc jockey from the Baltimore area, made a cameo appearance as a witness in the subway.|$|E

They later called the character [...] "a really nasty piece of work" [...] and when he stole from his father, they questioned if Jack would [...] "see what he's really like". Inside Soaps Peter Griffiths referred to Darren {{as one of the}} serial's [...] "reliable stalwarts", saying it was a [...] "relief" [...] when he appeared and added that Darren was one of the characters who can [...] "be relied upon to deliver". He added that the [...] "tried-and-tested" [...] characters helped the show through its rough patches and that they should be given the storylines they deserved. Griffiths' colleague Sarah maintained that Darren was {{the only part of the}} show that held her interest. The Press and Journal described Darren's time on the soap, saying: [...] "He languished in prison for helping his father fake his own death, has battled a crippling gambling addiction and has been known to steal people's girlfriends and break up relationships".|$|E

500|$|In November 1988, Guns N' Roses {{released}} the stopgap album G N' R Lies, which {{sold more than}} five million copies in the U.S. alone. The band – and Rose in particular – were accused of promoting racist and homophobic attitudes with the song [...] "One in a Million", in which Rose warns [...] "niggers" [...] to [...] "get out of my way" [...] and complains about [...] "faggots" [...] who [...] "spread some fucking disease". During the controversy, Rose defended {{his use of the}} racial slur by claiming that [...] "it's a word to describe somebody that is basically <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> your life, a problem. The word nigger doesn't necessarily mean black." [...] In 1992, however, he conceded that he had used the word as an insult towards black people, stating, [...] "I was pissed off about some black people that were trying to rob me. I wanted to insult those particular black people. I didn't want to support racism." [...] In response to the allegations of homophobia, Rose stated that he considered himself [...] "pro-heterosexual" [...] and blamed this attitude on [...] "bad experiences" [...] with gay men, citing an attempted rape in his late teens and the alleged molestation by his biological father. The controversy led to Guns N' Roses being dropped from the roster of an AIDS benefit show in New York organized by the Gay Men's Health Crisis.|$|E
500|$|Writing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall cited [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] as {{the best}} future-set episode of The Simpsons since the first one, [...] "Lisa's Wedding". He noted that it was [...] "the {{emotional}} side of things" [...] that made the episode successful, such as the dissatisfaction Bart and Lisa feel because of their disconnection with the children, and also Homer's transformation into a [...] "very wise, sweet guy after somehow surviving into old age." [...] Sepinwall particularly praised {{the scene at the}} cryonics facility where Homer encourages the children to give Bart another chance as [...] "really sweet", and he described the idea of a frozen Grampa as [...] "a clever variation on the very familiar joke of how Homer and the family neglect [...] because he's such <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> the ass." [...] Sepinwall also commended the episode for its jokes about the future, highlighting the scenes revolving around air travel as well as the scenes showing Krusty as [...] "the Andy Rooney of 2041" [...] and Ralph Wiggum as [...] "an endless series of stupid clones who keep killing one another." [...] In February 2012, [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] was listed by Matt Zoller Seitz of New York magazine as one of [...] "Nine Latter-Day Simpsons Episodes That Match Up to the Early Classics".
