40|$|This paper assesses whether {{perceived}} punishment severity changes discontinuously when {{an individual}} becomes an adult {{in the eyes of}} the courts. I find that the perceived chance of jail increases by 5. 2 percentage points at the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>majority,</b> which is over and above the general effect of aging. The magnitude of this subjective change in the chance of jail at the age of majority appears to be substantially smaller than that found in objective data. Finally, a reduced-form analysis of whether self-reported criminal behavior changes discontinuously at the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>majority</b> finds little consistent evidence of deterrence.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{a number of}} states have {{expanded}} the jurisdiction of their juvenile courts by increasing the maximum age to 18. Proponents argue that these expansions reduce crime by increasing access to the beneficial features of the juvenile justice system. Critics counter that the expansions risk increasing crime by reducing deterrence. In 2010, Illinois raised the maximum age for juvenile court for offenders who commit a misdemeanor. By examining the effect of this law on juvenile offenders in Chicago, this paper provides the first empirical estimates of the consequences of recent legislative activity to raise the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>majority.</b> Applying a difference-in-differences design with multiple control groups, we find little evidence of an effect. Our results suggest that—contrary to the expectations of both advocates and opponents—increasing the maximum age for juvenile court does not affect juvenile recidivism...|$|E
40|$|Nationwide, the 1990 s saw an {{increase}} in the rate of violent crimes committed by individuals under the age of 18. States responded to this rise with various policies including the lowering of the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>majority,</b> the age at which juveniles fully enter the adult criminal and judicial systems. This paper tests whether this policy caused a decrease in crime among the juveniles whose jurisdiction changed. I find that it did not. This conclusion is important since it sheds light {{on the question of whether}} juveniles respond rationally to heightened criminal sanctions. It is also an important conclusion in light of the social costs imposed by stiffer sanctions on juvenile crime including lower high school completion rates, higher recidivism rates, and higher expenses for taxpayers. This paper differs from prior research by using panel data and several applications of a difference-in-differences design to estimate this policy?s causal effect. In particular, this model tracks the crime rate over time of youths in Wisconsin and Wyoming whose jurisdiction changes from the juvenile to the adult system. The model compares the crime rates of each of these treatment groups to rates in various control groups in the same or a different state which do not undergo the same jurisdictional change. The results show that any deterrent effect of this policy change is too small?both in the long-term and the short-term?to be detected by these methods...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo {{principal}} deste trabalho foi investigar o julgamento moral de estudantes do ensino médio e de licenciaturas sobre pena de morte e redução da maioridade penal. Para tanto, utilizou-se como suporte teórico e empírico a tipologia do desenvolvimento moral de Lawrence Kohlberg. Participaram deste estudo 200 estudantes que responderam, além de uma lista que solicitava informações de alguns dos seus dados biodemográficos, a questões relacionadas à pena de morte e à redução da maioridade penal. De um modo geral, os participantes opinaram favoravelmente pela pena de morte e pela redução da maioridade penal, e, em defesa de suas opiniões, utilizaram, sobretudo, argumentos típicos dos estágios hierarquicamente inferiores da tipologia kohlberguiana, havendo, contudo, algumas diferenças entre as respostas em função do grau de escolaridade. Esses resultados foram discutidos com base na teoria kohlberguiana e em estudos empíricos que tratam dos temas pena de morte e redução da maioridade penal.

40|$|The <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> {{responsibility}} <b>of</b> {{children is}} important because of its relevance to children life.

40|$|This Dissertation {{consists}} of three empirical applications on the economics of crime and law enforcement. Chapter 1 uses over 200, 000 patrol stops conducted by the Oakland Police Department to estimate differences in policing behavior among black, white, Hispanic, and Asian officers. In contrast to previous studies which consider average differences at the city or state level, this study uses individual officers' patrol assignments and the exact date, time, and geographic coordinates of each stop to identify between-officer differences. The data indicate little to no differences across officer race on average, but substantial differences within neighborhoods. In general, minority officers less intensely police all races in minority neighborhoods, but more intensely police all races in white neighborhoods relative to their white officer peers. A model of police behavior with imperfect information offers one explanation for this result. In the model, an unbiased officer with relatively high ability to interpret suspect behavior polices with relatively low intensity. The observed outcomes are then consistent with officers possessing neighborhood-specific informational advantages in policing, {{particularly with respect to}} their own race. That is, minority officers better interpret suspect behavior in minority neighborhoods, while white officers better interpret suspect behavior in white neighborhoods. Simulation results suggest that small differences in interpretative ability (modeled as noise in signals observed by the officer) can generate the observed magnitudes. Chapter 2, which is coauthored with Justin McCrary, presents evidence from six data sets on the participation of youth in crime near the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>majority.</b> The evidence suggests smooth behavior through the transition to adulthood, despite substantial changes in punitiveness, and is consistent with small deterrence effects of long prisons sentences for young offenders. Chapter 3 reconsiders the empirical analysis of Knowles, Persico, and Todd (2001). Knowles, Persico, and Todd (2001) presents a model of police and motorist behavior in the context of vehicle searches, and tests it using data from Maryland. The main implication of the Knowles et al. model is that in the absence of racial discrimination, the proportion of searches yielding drugs (or ''hit rate'') will be equated across races. A relatively low hit rate for any group suggests that police may improve their overall hit rate by shifting resources away from that group, and is thus evidence toward discrimination. Using data on vehicle searches by Maryland State Police, they find no bias against blacks relative to whites, but significant bias against white females and particularly Hispanics. However, while their study focused on searches occurring along Interstate 95, this study considers all vehicle searches in Maryland, both for the time period studied in Knowles, Persico, and Todd (2001) (1995 [...] 1999) and in more recent years (1995 [...] 2006). The main results suggest substantially lower hit rates for blacks for searches occurring off Interstate 95, though almost no difference for searches on Interstate 95...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the tension between {{government}} protestations that youth justice policy is evidence-led and what the evidence implies in the context <b>of</b> the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> responsibility. Design/methodology/approach – The paper takes the form of a conceptual analysis of government policy and the evidence base. Findings – The paper concludes that the current low <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> responsibility in England and Wales can be understood as a manifestation of the influence of underclass theory on successive governments. Research limitations/implications – The paper is not based on primary research. Practical implications – The arguments adduced help to explain the reluctance of government to countenance any increase in the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> responsibility. Social implications – The analysis might help inform approaches adopted by youth justice policy makers, practitioners and academics with an interest in seeking a rise in the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> responsibility.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the minimum <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> capacity (which is currently set at 10 years {{in terms of the}} Child Justice Act 75 of 2008). It deals in particular with {{the question of whether the}} minimum <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> capacity should be raised and if so, whether the presumption of doli incapax should be retained. A consideration of the relevant international instruments shows that the situation as it currently stands in South African law is not internationally acceptable. South Africa is failing to comply with the obligations which it incurred through the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and with the current international practice pertaining to the minimum <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> capacity. The current minimum <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> capacity is simply too low. The question of whether the presumption of doli incapax should be retained is also dealt with. The problems that are being experienced by its application in practice (inter alia the difficulties in the assessment <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> capacity by mental health professionals and the possibility of an over reliance on prosecutorial discretion) leads to the conclusion that the “protective mantle” which the presumption was intended to provide no longer exists.
