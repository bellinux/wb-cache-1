2500|$|In January 1998, Senior Chief Petty Officer Timothy R. McVeigh (not to be {{confused}} with convicted Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy J. McVeigh) won a preliminary injunction from a U.S. district court that prevented his discharge from the U.S. Navy for [...] "homosexual conduct" [...] after 17 years of service. His lawsuit did not challenge the DADT policy, but asked the court to hold the military accountable for adhering to the policy's particulars. The Navy had investigated McVeigh's sexual orientation based on his AOL email <b>account</b> <b>name</b> and user profile. District Judge Stanley Sporkin ruled in McVeigh v. Cohen that the Navy had violated its own DADT guidelines: [...] "Suggestions of sexual orientation in a private, anonymous email account did not give the Navy a sufficient reason to investigate to determine whether to commence discharge proceedings." [...] He called the Navy's investigation [...] "a search and destroy mission" [...] against McVeigh. The case also attracted attention because a navy paralegal had misrepresented himself when querying AOL for information about McVeigh's account. Frank Rich linked the two issues: [...] "McVeigh is as clear-cut a victim of a witch hunt as could be imagined, and that witch hunt could expand exponentially if the military wants to add on-line fishing to its invasion of service members' privacy." [...] AOL apologized to McVeigh and paid him damages. McVeigh reached a settlement with the Navy that paid his legal expenses and allowed him to retire with full benefits in July. The New York Times called Sporkin's ruling [...] "a victory for gay rights, with implications for the millions of people who use computer on-line services".|$|E
50|$|VS/9 {{controlled}} access {{through the use}} of an <b>account</b> <b>name</b> and a user name. The <b>account</b> <b>name</b> was a 1 to 7 character identifier, and the user name was also a 1 to 8 character identifier. Identifiers for account names and user names could only be letters and numbers. The <b>account</b> <b>name</b> was the equivalent of a directory name under Unix-style user accounts, with the note that the user name indicated which person sharing that account was the party using it. Thus, for example, if there was an <b>account</b> <b>name</b> of S0103, if there were two users, whose name were Pat and Leslie in that account, they would have a complete identifier of S0103,PAT and S0103,LESLIE. All of their files would be stored in the directory S0103 and thus, they could not create files with the same name. Note that if there was an <b>account</b> <b>name</b> of, say, PA5, if there was a user named Pat, their identifier would be PA5,PAT and would be completely unrelated to any other user named Pat.|$|E

In addition to moving tokens from one place to another, Steem is also a text content and metadata database that applications or websites can connect to.

Instead of using cryptographic hashes as addresses like many blockchains do, user-chosen alphanumeric <b>account</b> <b>names</b> are used. With human readable <b>account</b> <b>names,</b> transactions can be made directly from an identity to an identity, making them easier to understand than hexadecimal hashes.|$|R

Avoid this by removing the text including the brackets and replacing with another category if desired. The only exception to this is an opening balance transaction, identified by 'Opening Balance' in the 'P' field (POpening Balance). In this case, the brackets need to be left in place, and the <b>account</b> <b>name</b> between the brackets must exactly match the <b>account</b> <b>name</b> in the 'N' field.|$|E

50|$|The {{lack of an}} {{apostrophe}} in {{the official}} title of the organisation stems from the requirement that {{the name of a}} financial institution account needs to exactly match the name of an organisation as it appears in its incorporation documents. Furthermore, the <b>account</b> <b>name</b> input fields of financial institutions don't accept the apostrophe as a valid character, causing deposits to bounce if the entered name does not match the <b>account</b> <b>name.</b> Hence for practical reasons the apostrophe remains omitted in spite of the grammatical error.|$|E
