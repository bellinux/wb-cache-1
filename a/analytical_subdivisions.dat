40|$|Goal: To {{detect the}} state of {{communications}} between municipal authorities and the population; to devise recommendations on creating public information system to improve communications between municipal authorities and the population. Methods: The study {{is based on the}} results of opinion poll ‘Information Needs of the Population of Gubkinskiy Urban District ’ conducted in Gubkinskiy urban district in 2010, which included:- a questionnaire survey (a representative sample, based on three criteria – type of settlement, sex, age, n= 600 of respondents, standard sampling error did not exceed 4. 5 %);- a survey of experts (the group of experts included municipal employees, who work with public information system, n= 50 respondents). Results: The author suggests a model of public information system for managing a municipal entity and improving communications between the authorities and the population. Scope of application: The results can be used by <b>analytical</b> <b>subdivisions</b> of local authority departments; in special-purpose programmes to improve public information systems of municipal government; in designing academic courses for university students majoring in State and Municipal Management...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} and methodology of cassava research are discussed. Research {{on the potential}} world demand for the crop was divided into different components: the country was {{the unit of analysis}} and the market, the 2 nd level of <b>analytical</b> <b>subdivision</b> where individual markets were assumed to be independent; the potential demand in each market was analyzed separately (market size, growth prospects, and price of competition with main substitutes). In Asia, a multiple cassava market system is already well developed. Growth markets exist for cassava to the point that production is not keeping up with demand. However, little improved production technology has reached the farm level. Declining costs of production could accelerate the diversification of markets in Asia, especially into the animal feed market. The existing market structure could absorb significant increases in production, without drastic inclines in prices. A range of benefits could be attained, including simultaneous improvements in the welfare of the low- income consumer and in the income of small-scale farmers in upland areas. On the other hand, traditional food markets continue to dominate the overall demand for cassava in Latin America; only in Brazil do traditional dried cassava products dominate in overall cassava demand. The major potential growth in demand for cassava exists in the market for animal feed components. Integrated cassava development projects have proved to be good initial interventions. (CIAT...|$|R
40|$|The chronostratigraphical {{subdivision}} of the Pliocene and Early Pleistocene {{as applied}} in terrestrial deposits of Central and NW-Europe largely {{relies on the}} pollen <b>analytical</b> investigations. This <b>subdivision</b> is almost entirely based on the interpretation of quantitative changes of the vegetational cover as recorded by the pollen content of fluvial deposits in the Lower Rhine Embayment. The Early and Middle Pliocene stages are originally defined in the type areas near Susteren and Brunssum along the southern border of the roer valley graben (RVG). Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene stages have been defined in the Venlo-Tegelen area on the Peel Block, {{just north of the}} RVG. A critical review of existing data has been carried out considering lithostratigraphical data, provenance studies and palaeogeography in comparison especially with the interpretation of palynological results. As a result, it is concluded that the existing subdivision of the Pliocene into stages and substages defined by pollen assemblages has not been executed correctly. As a consequence, the application of this subdivision in geological reconstructions and modelling reveals many problems and pitfalls. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA...|$|R
