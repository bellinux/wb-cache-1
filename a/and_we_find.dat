2500|$|Note {{that not}} every {{continuous}} function on the boundary {{can be used to}} produce a function inside the boundary that fits the given boundary function. For instance, if we put the function, defined for |z|=1, [...] into the Cauchy integral formula, we get zero for all points inside the circle. In fact, giving just the real part on the boundary of a holomorphic function is enough to determine the function up to an imaginary constant – there is only one imaginary part on the boundary that corresponds to the given real part, up to addition of a constant. We can use a combination of a Möbius transformation and the Stieltjes inversion formula to construct the holomorphic function from the real part on the boundary. For example, the function [...] has real part [...] On the unit circle this can be written [...] Using the Möbius transformation and the Stieltjes formula we construct the function inside the circle.

2500|$|We {{possess an}} {{important}} {{law of the}} Bavarians, whose duchy was situated in the region east of the river Lech. Parts of this law have been taken directly from the Visigothic law of Euric and from {{the law of the}} Alamanni. The Bavarian law, therefore, is later than that of the Alamanni. It dates unquestionably from a period when the Frankish authority was very strong in Bavaria, when the dukes were subjects of the Frankish kings. The law's compilation is most commonly dated between 744 and 748, by the following argument; Immediately after the revolt of Bavaria in 743 the Bavarian Duke Odilo (died 748) was forced to submit to Pippin the Younger and Carloman, the sons of Charles Martel, and to recognize Frankish suzerainty. A little earlier, in 739, the church of Bavaria had been organized by St. Boniface, and the country divided into several bishoprics; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> frequent references to these bishops (in the plural) in the law of the Bavarians. On the other hand, we know that the law is anterior to the reign of Duke Tassilo III (749-788). The date of compilation must, therefore, be placed between 744 and 748. [...] Against this argument, however, it is very likely that Odilo recognized Frankish authority before 743; he took refuge at Charles Martel's court that year and married one of Martel's daughters. [...] His [...] "revolt" [...] may have been in support of the claims of Pippin and Carloman's half-brother Grifo, not opposition to Frankish rule per se. [...] Also, {{it is not clear that}} the Lex Baiuvariorum refers to multiple bishops in the duchy at the same time; when a bishop is accused of a crime, for instance, he is to be tried by the duke, and not by a council of fellow bishops as canon law required. [...] So, it is possible that the Bavarian law was compiled earlier, perhaps between 735 (the year of Odilo's succession) and 739.|$|E

But by the 10th century the rule was commonly set aside, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> frequent complaints of abbots dressing in silk, and adopting sumptuous attire. [...] Some even laid aside the monastic habit altogether, and assumed a secular dress. With the increase of wealth and power, abbots had lost much of their special religious character, and become great lords, chiefly distinguished from lay lords by celibacy. [...] Thus we hear of abbots going out to hunt, with their men carrying bows and arrows; keeping horses, dogs and huntsmen; and special mention is made of an abbot of Leicester, c. 1360, who was the most skilled of all the nobility in hare hunting. [...] In magnificence of equipage and retinue the abbots vied with the first nobles of the realm. [...] They rode on mules with gilded bridles, rich saddles and housings, carrying hawks on their wrist, followed by an immense train of attendants. [...] The bells of the churches were rung as they passed. [...] They associated on equal terms with laymen of the highest distinction, and shared all their pleasures and pursuits. [...] This rank and power was, however, often used most beneficially. [...] For instance, we read of Whiting, the last abbot of Glastonbury, judicially murdered by Henry VIII, that his house was a kind of well-ordered court, where as many as 300 sons of noblemen and gentlemen, who had been sent to him for virtuous education, had been brought up, besides others of a lesser rank, whom he fitted for the universities. His table, attendance and officers were an honour to the nation. He would entertain as many as 500 persons of rank at one time, besides relieving the poor of the vicinity twice a week. He had his country houses and fisheries, and when he travelled to attend parliament his retinue amounted to upwards of 100 persons. [...] The abbots of Cluny and Vendôme were, by virtue of their office, cardinals of the Roman church.|$|E
