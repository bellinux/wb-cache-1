The current paper reviews 23 studies reporting {{the occurrence of}} posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and associated predictors of these outcomes in <b>adolescent</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> adult {{cancer survivors}}. Results indicate considerable variability among prevalence estimates of PTSD (0 %– 34. 8 %) and PTSS (4. 4 %– 78 %). Measurement inconsistencies limiting the ascertainment of reliable prevalence and risk estimates {{are discussed in the}} context of the reviewed literature. Specifically, differences in assessment measures utilized, the timing of assessment relative to diagnosis, the criteria used to define the outcome, and identification of the precipitating traumatic event may account for discrepancies in prevalence and risk estimates across studies. The application of specific PTSD diagnostic criteria to a survivorship population is discussed.

25|$|Venlafaxine is {{contraindicated}} in children, <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> adults. According to the FDA {{analysis of}} clinical trials venlafaxine caused {{a statistically significant}} 5-fold increase in suicidal ideation and behaviour in persons younger than 25. In another analysis, venlafaxine was no better than placebo among children (7–11 years old), but improved depression in adolescents (12–17 years old). However, in both groups, hostility and suicidal behaviour increased in comparison to those receiving a placebo. In a study involving antidepressants that had failed to produce results in depressed teenagers, teens whose SSRI treatment had failed who were randomly switched to either another SSRI or to venlafaxine showed an increased rate of suicide on venlafaxine. Among teenagers who were suicidal {{at the beginning of}} the study, the rate of suicidal attempts and self-harm was significantly higher, by about 60%, after the switch to venlafaxine than after the switch to an SSRI.|$|E
500|$|Motor vehicle crashes were a {{major factor}} {{that led to the}} {{development}} of emergency medicine in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and they are {{a major factor}} leading countries to develop their own emergency medical systems today. Such crashes represent a leading cause of death for <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> <b>young</b> adults, with the majority of deaths occurring in the developing world. In recent decades, while traffic fatalities have declined in industrialized nations, they have been on the rise in developing ones. Furthermore, developing nations tend to have a higher proportion of fatalities per number of vehicles for various reasons, including lower safety standards for vehicles. The lack of available emergency care in many developing countries only serves to exacerbate this problem. This higher rate of accident mortality per vehicle exists despite the fact that there are fewer cars in Asia and Africa than in the West. Odero et al. argue that this shows a need to improve emergency medical care.|$|E
