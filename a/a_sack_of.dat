5|$|On July 27, 2013, Schofield was claimed off waivers by the Seattle Seahawks. He posted <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> Cam Newton in {{his debut}} with the 2013 Seahawks against the Carolina Panthers.

However, the deal was called off due to a problem with his physical. He re-signed with the Seahawks on May 2, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Sherlock Holmes Baffled is a {{very short}} American silent film created in 1900 with {{cinematography}} by Arthur Marvin. It is the earliest known film to feature Arthur Conan Doyle's detective character Sherlock Holmes, albeit in a form unlike that of later screen incarnations. The inclusion of the character also makes it the first recorded detective film. In the film, a thief who can appear and disappear at will steals <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> items from Sherlock Holmes. At each point, Holmes's attempts to thwart the intruder end in failure.|$|E

5|$|The Hokies {{were forced}} to punt again, and Brent Bowden's 50-yard punt stuck the Eagles deep in their own territory. The drive began with a five-yard penalty against Boston College and culminated two plays later in a six-yard loss on <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> Matt Ryan by Hokie defender Barry Booker. Boston College punted, but the kick by Johnny Ayers {{traveled}} just 34yards before sailing out of bounds.|$|E
5|$|Geisel Library's {{collection}} of over 200,000 books originated in <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> books brought by Father Hugo Paff, O.S.B. from Saint Mary's Abbey in Newark, New Jersey; these books {{are still in}} the library and date back to the mid- to late-19th century. The college's first library, shaped around this initial collection, was situated {{on the first floor of}} Alumni Hall. During the early years of the college, Benedictines served as librarians on an ad hoc basis, but by 1929, Saint Anselm had its first official librarian, Father Cuthbert Redmond, O.S.B. New books were purchased under Father Edwin Davitt, O.S.B. By 1937, Saint Anselm could boast 8,000 books in several mini-libraries, as well as the main repository, by this time located on the second floor.|$|E

Back at the police station, Mooney is innundated with calls from townspeople reporting incidents with the klowns, but he dismisses all of them. Soon after, a klown arrives at the station and Mooney arrests it, believing it to be a teen prankster. Dave returns to the station to find two prisoners encased in cocoons, and the now escaped klown using a deceased Mooney as a ventriloquist's dummy. Dave shoots the klown several times before destroying its nose, which causes it to spin wildly and explode.|$|E

The last two sieges were fierce and the capture of Bredevoort even led to <b>a</b> <b>sacking</b> <b>of</b> the city. Maurice then moved on the city of Enschede where the place surrendered soon afterward.|$|R
5|$|On {{the first}} play of the drive, Rix {{completed}} a 42-yard pass to Craphonso Thorpe. On the next play, the Seminoles advanced the ball 11 more yards on a running play. From the Tech 18-yard line, the Seminoles were stopped for no gain, endured <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> Rix, then committed a five-yard false start penalty. After being pushed back to the Tech 34-yard line, the Seminoles were unable to get a first down and elected to try a long field goal kick. Florida State placekicker Xavier Beitia entered the game to attempt a 50-yard kick. The kick was successful, and with 1:27 remaining in the first half, Florida State extended its lead to 103.|$|E
5|$|Other methods {{commonly}} practised in Europe included severing the tendons at {{the knees}} or placing poppy seeds, millet, or sand {{on the ground at}} the grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied all night by counting the fallen grains, indicating an association of vampires with arithmomania. Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampire-like being came across <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> rice, it would have to count every grain; this is a theme encountered in myths from the Indian subcontinent, as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.|$|E
5|$|The free kick {{following}} the intentional safety {{was returned to}} near midfield, and Davis passed for a first down. Following the second down, Davis was sacked for a loss, but then scrambled for a first down to the Tech 25-yard line. From there, however, Boston College's offense began to struggle. During the four plays that followed, the Eagles were able to gain just one yard and turned the ball over on downs again. The final Boston College play was <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> Davis, and Virginia Tech proceeded to run out the clock by kneeling on the ball after taking the field on offense.|$|E

5|$|After Auburn's kickoff, Virginia Tech {{started its}} first drive {{of the second}} half at its 20-yard line. Down by 16 points, Tech needed to score. The Hokies gained a quick first down, but a five-yard penalty and <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> Bryan Randall {{prevented}} Tech from gaining another. The Hokies were forced to punt, and Auburn took over at its 44-yard line. Despite having good field position, the Tigers went three and out. Following the punt, Virginia Tech reciprocated by also going three and out. With 3:47 remaining in the quarter, Auburn began an offensive drive from its 35-yard line. From the beginning of the drive, however, the Tigers had problems. The first play of Auburn's drive was a 10-yard penalty against the Tigers. The second resulted in a one-yard loss by Ronnie Brown, who attempted to rush through the middle of the defensive line. On the third play, Virginia Tech cornerback Jimmy Williams intercepted an errant pass by Jason Campbell. Though Williams was unable to advance the ball, the Hokies still took over on offense, and with 2:38 remaining in the quarter, had their best field position since the first half.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Cincinnati 28-yard line, and the Bearcats' offense began its first possession of the second quarter. Pike threw an incomplete pass, then connected on a 10-yard throw for a first down. That gain was countered on the next play by a 10-yard holding penalty against the Bearcats. Cincinnati was unable to regain the yardage lost to the penalty and punted. Following the kick, Virginia Tech was similarly stymied by consecutive penalties and <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> Taylor by Cincinnati's Terrill Byrd. Tech punted, and the kick {{was returned}} by Cincinnati wide receiver D.J. Woods to the Virginia Tech 45-yard line. Despite starting in Virginia Tech's half of the field, Cincinnati was unable to capitalize and went three and out. The Bearcats' punt was downed at the Virginia Tech three-yard line, and the Hokies' offense returned to the field.|$|E

AlenÃ§on's smaller force made an attack on the besieging positions commanded by Lord Shrewsbury, the larger force against the south of the besieging lines where Lord Herbert commanded. Both attacks were designed to act as diversions in order that the stradiots be able to reach ThÃ©rouanne with supplies. Each stradiot had a side of bacon at his saddlebow and <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> gunpowder behind him.|$|E
25|$|Linebacker NaVorro Bowman led {{the defense}} with eleven tackles. Defensive tackle Jared Odrick made a career-high six stops, with 2.5 tackles for loss, but his biggest play {{occurred}} with 4:39 {{remaining in the}} third quarter when he sacked Michigan quarterback Nick Sheridan, who was playing in place of the injured Steven Threet, in the end zone for a safety and Penn State's first lead of the game, 19â€“17. Aaron Maybin finished with four tackles, including <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> Threet that forced a fumble, which was recovered by Abe Koroma and led to a Penn State touchdown.|$|E

25|$|The army {{also used}} {{scorched}} earth tactics {{as a means}} to intimidate the enemy and to secure easier future victories. The ruthless sacks of Martaban in 1541 and Prome in 1542 served to secure the fealty of Lower Burma to the upstart regime of Tabinshwehti of Toungoo. Threatened by Bayinnaung's army of <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> their capital Ayutthaya, the Siamese duly surrendered in 1564. When the Siamese changed their mind in 1568, the city was brutally sacked in 1569. Two hundred years later, the army's brutal sack of Pegu in 1757 secured the subsequent tribute missions of Chiang Mai, Martaban and Tavoy to Alaungpaya's court. Indeed, the brutal 1767 sack of Ayutthaya has been in a major sore point in the Burmese-Thai relations to the present day.|$|E
25|$|An {{exchange}} of three punts brought the game {{into the second}} quarter, where Morris ran for 34 yards on the second play of a Patriots drive {{to put them in}} the Broncos' red zone yet again. Four plays later, on 4th-and-1 from the Broncos' 4-yard line, Morris ran for a 4-yard touchdown that gave the Patriots a 13â€“0 lead. The Broncos' next drive ended with Meriweather intercepting a deep throw by Cutler, setting up the Patriots' next series at their own 16-yard line. After <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> Cassel put the Patriots even deeper into their own territory, a facemask penalty on Cassel on third down by Broncos linebacker Jamie Winborn gave the Patriots a new set of downs. Five plays later, on another 4th-and-1, Morris ran for 29 yards to give the Patriots a first down from the Broncos' 13-yard line; he ran for a total of 138 yards on 16 carries. On the next play, Moss caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from Cassel to extend the Patriots' lead to 20â€“0. The Broncos' next drive began with backup Patrick Ramsey replacing Cutler at quarterback. On the fourth play, defensive lineman Mike Wright sacked Ramsey and forced a fumble, which undrafted free agent linebacker Gary Guyton caught to give the Patriots the ball at midfield. Cassel suffered his fifth sack on the next play, the final of the first half.|$|E
