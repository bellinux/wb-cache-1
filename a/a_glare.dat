5|$|But if {{you were}} here, my father, you'd tell me to stand by my job and not to desert Mr. McClure in this crisis. It would mean such a serious loss to him in money and {{influence}} {{not to have the}} March article come outâ€”Everyone would think he was beaten and scared out, for the articles are under such <b>a</b> <b>glare</b> of publicity and such a fire of criticism. I {{had nothing to do with}} the January article remember, my work begins to appear in February. Mr. McClure is ill from worry and anxiety...|$|E
500|$|The Mahabharata {{describes}} him thus: Kabandha was [...] "as {{big as a}} mountain, dark as a black cloud, with pointed hairs {{all over}} his body and looked fierce with a voice as loud as thunder. He had an eye on his stomach, round and yellow, emitting <b>a</b> <b>glare</b> like a fire-name. Looking wicked he thrust his big tongue out of his huge mouth licking the sides." [...] The Ramayana presents a similar description of Kabandha. Kabandha had a broad chest and was without a head or neck. He had only one eye {{on his chest and}} a mouth on his belly. He used his long arms to draw his prey closer. Kabandha is often depicted as a tree.|$|E
500|$|Macaulay's bowling {{action was}} relaxed and effortless, being admired by his contemporaries. Kilburn wrote: [...] "His run-up was half-shambling, his steps short and his {{shoulders}} swaying, but {{his feet were}} faultlessly placed and his aim was high at the instant of delivery". However, critics and team-mates more widely knew him as passionate, hostile and fiery when bowling. Kilburn said that batsmen were Macaulay's [...] "mortal enemies". He knew many tricks to dismiss or unsettle them, including the tactic of bowling the ball straight at their head without pitching, which was usually considered dangerous and unfair. Kilburn observed that [...] "should the batsman survive he would be rewarded with <b>a</b> <b>glare</b> of concentrated venom calculated to stagger any but the stoutest heart... Every scrap of his heart and soul went into every ball he bowled. He never gave up and his persistence was invariably triumphant sooner or later". The Yorkshire Post, after his death, observed: [...] "Macaulay will always be remembered for the fierceness of his enthusiasm {{when there was a}} fighting chance of victory".|$|E

2500|$|Any {{planet is}} an {{extremely}} faint light source compared to its parent star. For example, a star like the Sun is about a billion times as bright as the reflected light {{from any of the}} planets orbiting it. In addition to the intrinsic difficulty of detecting such a faint light source, the light from the parent star causes <b>a</b> <b>glare</b> that washes it out. For those reasons, very few of the extrasolar planets reported [...] have been observed directly, with even fewer being resolved from their host star.|$|E
60|$|It {{was high}} noon at Tres Pinos. The three pines {{from which it}} gained its name, in the dusty road and hot air, seemed to smoke from their balsamic spires.
