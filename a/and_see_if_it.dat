Some members of parliament suggested that Verdonk's stern actions were a result of her political ambitions in the 2006 VVD leadership elections. The result of the debate was that Verdonk promised to have another look at the case <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was possible for Hirsi Ali keep her citizenship.|$|E

500|$|Suganami {{was deeply}} {{invested}} in Alien Soldier and devoted {{a lot of}} personal time to developing it. He began developing the game himself as the sole designer and programmer. At the time, Mega Drive games typically required two designers and two programmers, but Suganami wanted to challenge himself <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was possible to create the game himself. He originally had ambitious plans for a large backstory, but in order to make their deadline of 3 January 1995, the majority of it was cut from the game. As the deadline approached, he came to realize {{he would not be able}} to complete Alien Soldier himself, and so additional staff were added to provide him support. He worked overtime during the New Years holidays in order to complete the game while the market for the Mega Drive was quickly shrinking. Only about half of the team's original ideas were completed in time for release. They originally planned to create 100 bosses, but this was cut much shorter due to the time constraints. One of the bosses that was included, [...] "Seven Force", was originally featured in Gunstar Heroes.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Indie Journal, Joseph said that when writing music he prefers {{to concentrate on the}} melody first, stating, [...] "Basically, I write from a two-person standpoint. [...] First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener." [...] This same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the Government Television Network with Joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody. [...] Then he would let it rest and come back to it <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> feels right. [...] Then he would start [...] "building around it", [...] like putting a car together - start with a frame and then start building things around it. Musically, he tries to connect a common bridge between such exhilarating feelings as performing at the Acropolis, to the emotions each and every one feels every day. [...] "In the end, a good melody will always stand the test of time", says Joseph.|$|E

[...] The men rode to a nearby location to wait <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> would be safe to return to the Alamo. [...] After several days, Dimmitt concluded that the wait was in vain and he and Noble left the area.|$|E

The latter purpose breaks Valve's tradition of employing experienced developers, as the company is not good at [...] "teaching people straight out of school".|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} BioShock {{received some}} criticism from PlayStation 3 owners, {{who found the}} port from the native Windows and Xbox 360 developed by a separate studio, Digital Extremes, to be lackluster. To address this, Irrational Games has stated that the PlayStation 3 version of Infinite {{would not be a}} port, as that version is being developed in-house simultaneously with the Windows and Xbox 360 versions. In addition, the PlayStation 3 version of the game will support stereoscopic 3D. BioShock Infinite will support the PlayStation Move motion controller. Though some reports believed that a new Move controller would be produced for the game based on information from Sony, 2K Games debunked these stories, stating that no new hardware is being developed for the game. The North American PlayStation 3 version of the game will include a copy of the original BioShock. Levine has expressed interest in a Wii U version of Infinite in light of what abilities the touchscreen controller can offer, but contends that the decision to develop for that platform is [...] "really a discussion that the business people have <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> makes sense for Nintendo, if it makes sense for Take Two". Aspyr helped to port Infinite to the OS X platform and was released on August 29, 2013.|$|E
