5|$|In its {{broadest}} definition, mimicry {{can include}} non-living models. The specific terms masquerade and mimesis are sometimes used when the models are inanimate.

Many animals bear eyespots, which are hypothesized to resemble the eyes of larger animals.

5|$|As {{attorney}} general, Crittenden issued {{only one}} notable opinion. The plaintiff {{in the case}} was an individual whose property had been damaged during Andrew Jackson's invasion of {{what would become the}} Florida Territory in 1818. The case was still being adjudicated in 1841. A Florida court found in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the federal government to compensate him for the damages and to pay him interest on his claim from the time the damages were incurred. Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing asked Crittenden whether the court had the authority to award interest <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> it should be paid. Crittenden opined that it did not, and Ewing did not pay the interest. Crittenden's opinion was used as a precedent in similar cases by future attorneys general.|$|E

5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of a person {{suffering}} from depression, and the story centers on their daily life, including encounters at work and their relationship with their girlfriend. The story also features various treatments for depression. Players are periodically faced with choices that alter the course of the story. To make a choice, the player must click on the corresponding hyperlink. However, choices are often crossed out and cannot be clicked on, a mechanism that Depression Quest uses to portray the character's mental state and the fact that logical decisions may not be available to them. Beneath the choices presented to the player are a set of statements about the character, indicating their level of depression, {{whether or not they are}} in therapy, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> they are currently on medication.|$|E

The Bruins were sold by Storer Broadcasting in August 1975 and the new Jacobs ownership group had to promise to keep Orr {{as a condition of}} the purchase. The Bruins and Orr reached a verbal agreement with the Jacobs during the summer of 1975, including a controversial agreement for Orr to take an 18.5% share of the Bruins after his playing days were over.

5|$|The {{zoning plan}} for the station was passed in 1998 and demands for {{accessibility}} were laid down in 2003, causing a contrast between these goals and the curved platforms. This would particularly be a challenge for the Class 70 trains, which would have a wide gap. Part of the dispute centered on the Vollsveien Bridge, {{whether or not it}} had a heritage status <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> its demolition would allow for a straight station. Minister of Transport and Communication Torild Skogsholm stated that she laid the blame on director of the National Rail Administration, Steinar Killi. Her successor, Liv Signe Navarsete, announced in July 2006 that the construction would continue following the curved design, though minor functional changes would be made.|$|E
5|$|Theobald {{also had}} a dispute with St Augustine's Abbey over {{the right of the}} {{archbishop}} to receive annual payments, and whether those payments were for sacraments performed by the archbishop, which would have been uncanonical, or were for other reasons. The dispute was eventually settled by a compromise in which St Augustine's continued to make the payments but they were specifically stated not to be for sacraments. Another dispute with St Augustine's concerned the right of the archbishops to have a say in the election of new abbots <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the abbots would make a profession of obedience to the archbishops. This was eventually settled by a papal mandate of 1144 instructing the abbots to profess obedience.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the end of}} the legislative session, Beshear called for a special legislative session to consider a way to meet the state's Medicaid obligations <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to raise the minimum dropout age. In the special session, legislators also approved raising the minimum dropout age to 18 during the special session. Following the session, the National Education Association honored Beshear with its America's Greatest Education Governor Award for 2011, citing his advocacy for raising the minimum dropout age and his consistent refusal to cut education funding. Both houses also approved a plan that allowed Beshear to move the funds from the second year of the budget, but triggered automatic spending cuts if the managed care plans did not generate sufficient savings. The bill also called for the hiring of an independent accounting firm to assess the savings achieved by the managed care plans. Beshear then used his line-item veto to strike the spending cuts and the savings assessment provisions, per a previous arrangement with Democratic lawmakers. By eliminating these provisions, the version of the bill signed by Beshear was essentially the plan he had proposed during the regular session. The House adjourned the session March 24, but the Senate remained in session until April 6, voting to override Beshear's vetoes, but without concurrence from the House, the override votes were ineffective.|$|E

5|$|In {{between the}} time Scott {{released}} Alien in 1979 {{and returned to the}} franchise with Prometheus in 2012, he directed another notable science fiction film concerning artificial intelligence, Blade Runner, in 1982. Contrary to the white-blooded androids of Alien that emulate emotions and recognize a disconnect with humanity, Blade Runner features the replicants- enhanced biorobotic humanoids that may only be identified by their lacking emotions. In order to maintain control, the replicants' human creators install false memories that detail entire lives that give them a sense of identity. Blade Runner, a largely influential film, has prompted a slew of philosophical questions concerning artificial intelligence <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> an android could truly be considered alive. The film specifically questions whether thoughts, a sense of identity, emotions and consciousness in general, may be something genuine when applied to artificial intelligence. Due to David identifying himself as a living entity - similar to the replicants - film critics in 2012 would come not to only question if Prometheus was a direct prequel to Alien, but if the film had a relation to Blade Runner.|$|E
5|$|Israeli Arab {{historian}} Mustafa Kabha {{wrote that}} Egyptian and other Arab historians did not attribute as much {{importance to the}} battle as Israeli ones. They ask what the Egyptian objective was, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> it was wise to advance without securing their lines of communication. Abdullah el Tell, commander of the Jordanian Legion in Jerusalem, thought that the Egyptians did not consider the Legion's needs. Aware of their weaknesses, they did not let anything distract them from reaching Tel Aviv. The Egyptian war log, from 19:00 on May 28, 1948, showed concern over the lines of communication. Muhammad Nimr al-Hawari wrote that while the Egyptians publicly declared that the target was Tel Aviv, they never actually meant to advance farther than their Isdud fortifications. As evidence, he cited the Egyptian refusal to take the undefended Yibna despite the villagers' repeated cries for help. Bahjat Abu-Gharbiyeh, one of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni's deputies and commander of the Beit Jibrin area, wrote that the Egyptians never had a clear plan, because their leadership were not really interested in a war. Therefore, their efforts were improvised. Kabha concludes that Arab historiography considers the battle the successful realization of a tactical move, designed to serve {{the actions of the}} badly coordinated Arab armies.|$|E
5|$|The {{main points}} of historiographical dispute {{about the battle}} are {{whether or not the}} Egyptians were {{planning}} to advance northward toward Tel Aviv, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the battle was one of the turning points of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. On June 18, after the first truce of the war took effect, Nahum Sarig said in a staff meeting, attended by the Minister of Defense, that at the time the Egyptian plans were not clear, but that now their plans were to penetrate the Negev. Ben Gurion, on the other hand, noted in his diary that the Egyptians were set on taking Tel Aviv and advancing north. In 1958, Major General Yitzhak Rabin addressed the issue; he felt that the Egyptian stop at Isdud was the result of technical difficulties, following fifteen days of continuous movement, including battles along the way. This, Rabin thought, along with ground and aerial counterattacks, eventually delayed their drive on Tel Aviv. Later, he said, the Egyptians tried to make contact with the Jordanian forces at Latrun and, after a failed pincer movement, tried to cut the Negev off from Israel. According to Israeli historian Reuven Aharoni, the battle's glorification and idealization suited the sentimental needs of the Israeli people. He believes that there is still no definite {{answer to the question of}} whether or not the Egyptians planning to drive on to Tel Aviv.|$|E
