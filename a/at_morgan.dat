5|$|By 1972, Pink Floyd had {{recorded}} the soundtracks to the films The Committee (1968) and More (1969), and to part of Zabriskie Point (1970). On {{the back of}} Mores success, its director Barbet Schroeder asked the band to record the soundtrack of his next major project as and when it arrived. The new film, La Vallée, featured two travellers on a spiritual quest in New Guinea, and Schroeder thought Pink Floyd would be suitable to provide the music. The group had already started working on another album, The Dark Side of the Moon, including some basic recording and live performances, but took two breaks to Strawberry Studios, Château d'Hérouville, France, {{either side of a}} Japanese tour, to write and record music for the film. The album was then mixed from 4–6 April <b>at</b> <b>Morgan</b> Sound Studios in London.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{started in}} December 1971 <b>at</b> <b>Morgan</b> Studios, London. Unlike {{previous}} albums, where Anderson had generally written songs in advance, only the initial {{section of the}} album had been worked out when the band went into the studio. The remainder of the suite was written during the recording sessions. To compensate {{for a lack of}} material, Anderson got up early each morning to prepare music {{for the rest of the}} band to learn during that day's session. The lyrics were written first, with the music constructed to fit around them. Anderson recalls the album took about two weeks to record and another two or three for overdubs and mixing. The final work spanned the entire length of an LP record, split over two sides.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Baltimore {{was home to}} several African American classically {{oriented}} music institutions which drew on a rich tradition of symphonic music, chamber concerts, oratorios, documented {{in large part by}} the Baltimore Afro-American, a local periodical. Inspired by A. Jack Thomas, who had been appointed conductor of the city's municipally supported African American performance groups, Charles L. Harris led the Baltimore Colored Chorus and Symphony Orchestra from 1929 to 1939, when a strike led to the company's dissolution. Thomas {{had been one of the}} first black bandleaders in the U.S. Army, was director of the music department <b>at</b> <b>Morgan</b> College, and was the founder of Baltimore's interracial Aeolian Institute for higher musical education. Charles L. Harris, as leader of the Baltimore Colored City Band, took his group to black neighborhoods across Baltimore, playing marches, waltzes and other music, then switch to jazz-like music with an upbeat tempo, meant for dancing. Some of Harris' musicians also played in early jazz clubs, though the musical establishment at the time did not readily accept the style. Fred Huber, Director of Municipal Music for Baltimore, exerted powerful control over the repertoire of these bands, and forbade jazz. T. Henderson Kerr, a prominent black bandleader, emphasized in his advertising that his group did not play jazz, while the prestigious Peabody Institute debated whether jazz was music at all. The Symphony Orchestra produced renowned pianist Ellis Larkins and cellist W. Llewellyn Wilson, also the music critic for the Afro-American. Harris eventually replaced Harris as conductor of the Orchestra and has since become a city musical fixture who is said to have, at one point, taught every single African American music teacher in Baltimore.|$|E
