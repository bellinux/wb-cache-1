5|$|Judith Fingeret Krug (March 15, 1940– April 11, 2009) was an American librarian, {{freedom of}} speech proponent, <b>and</b> <b>critic</b> of censorship. Krug became {{director}} of the Office for Intellectual Freedom at the American Library Association in 1967. In 1969, she joined the Freedom to Read Foundation as its executive director. Krug co-founded Banned Books Week in 1982.|$|E

5|$|Rufus Wilmot Griswold (February 13, 1815 – August 27, 1857) was an American anthologist, editor, poet, <b>and</b> <b>critic.</b> Born in Vermont, Griswold {{left home}} when he was 15 years old. He worked as a journalist, editor, <b>and</b> <b>critic</b> in Philadelphia, New York City, and elsewhere. He built up a strong {{literary}} reputation, {{in part due to}} his 1842 collection The Poets and Poetry of America. This anthology, the most comprehensive of its time, included what he deemed the best examples of American poetry. He produced revised versions and similar anthologies for the remainder of his life, although many of the poets he promoted have since faded into obscurity. Many writers hoped to have their work included in one of these editions, although they commented harshly on Griswold's abrasive character. Griswold was married three times: his first wife died young, his second marriage ended in a public and controversial divorce, and his third wife left him after the previous divorce was almost repealed.|$|E

This edition is now out of print, but in 2013 the DVD was re-released with new cover art by 101 Films, which also included the commentary by Kneale and Newman. It was also included in a two-disc edition with the BBC's Ghostwatch programme from 1992.|$|E
5|$|Ebert was a {{recovering}} alcoholic, having quit drinking in 1979. He {{was a member}} of Alcoholics Anonymous and had written some blog entries on the subject. He was a longtime friend of, and briefly dated, Oprah Winfrey, who credited him with persuading her to syndicate The Oprah Winfrey Show, which became the highest-rated talk show in American television history. He was also friends with film historian <b>and</b> <b>critic</b> Leonard Maltin and considered the book Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide (final update in 2014) to be the standard of film guide books.|$|E
5|$|Ezra Weston Loomis Pound (30 October 1885– 1 November 1972) was an {{expatriate}} American poet <b>and</b> <b>critic,</b> {{as well as}} a major {{figure in}} the early modernist movement. His contribution to poetry began with his development of Imagism, a movement derived from classical Chinese and Japanese poetry, stressing clarity, precision and economy of language. His works include Ripostes (1912), Hugh Selwyn Mauberley (1920) and the unfinished 120-section epic, The Cantos (1917–1969).|$|E

5|$|Lowell {{believed}} that the poet {{played an important role}} as a prophet <b>and</b> <b>critic</b> of society. He used poetry for reform, particularly in abolitionism. However, his commitment to the anti-slavery cause wavered over the years, as did his opinion on African-Americans. He attempted to emulate the true Yankee accent in the dialogue of his characters, particularly in The Biglow Papers. This depiction of the dialect, as well as his many satires, was an inspiration to writers such as Mark Twain and H. L. Mencken.|$|E
5|$|Sarah Trimmer (née Kirby; 6January 1741 – 15December 1810) was {{a writer}} <b>and</b> <b>critic</b> of 18th-century British children's literature, {{as well as an}} {{educational}} reformer. Her periodical, The Guardian of Education, helped to define the emerging genre by seriously reviewing children's literature for the first time; it also provided the first history of children's literature, establishing a canon of the early landmarks of the genre that scholars still use today. Trimmer's most popular children's book, Fabulous Histories, inspired numerous children's animal stories and remained in print for over a century.|$|E
5|$|Sir John Frederick Neville Cardus, CBE (3 April 188828 February 1975) was an English writer <b>and</b> <b>critic.</b> From {{an impoverished}} home background, and mainly self-educated, he became The Manchester Guardians cricket {{correspondent}} in 1919 and its chief music critic in 1927, holding the two posts simultaneously until 1940. His contributions {{to these two}} distinct fields {{in the years before}} the Second World War established his {{reputation as one of the}} foremost critics of his generation.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{companies}} that he recorded for at this stage in his career reduced Hope's dignity, in the view of musician <b>and</b> <b>critic</b> Robert Palmer. One album was entitled High Hope! (1961), and another, released as Sounds from Rikers Island (1963) in reference to a New York City jail complex, featured performances exclusively by musicians who had at some point been imprisoned for drug-related crimes. Between these two sessions as leader, Hope was briefly in prison again for drug offenses. These and other album releases in the early 1960s did little to develop a wider awareness of Hope.|$|E
5|$|The Italian artist <b>and</b> <b>critic</b> Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) {{first used}} the term rinascita {{retrospectively}} in his book The Lives of the Artists (published 1550). In the book Vasari attempted to define {{what he described as}} a break with the barbarities of gothic art: the arts (he held) had fallen into decay {{with the collapse of the}} Roman Empire and only the Tuscan artists, beginning with Cimabue (1240–1301) and Giotto (1267–1337) began to reverse this decline in the arts. Vasari saw antique art as central to the rebirth of Italian art.|$|E
5|$|The Lives did not attract enough {{critical}} {{attention to}} become a bestseller. A fair number were printed and sold, however, and far more copies of the Lives circulated than of Shelley's novels. Some of the volumes were illegally copied in the United States, where they were praised by the poet <b>and</b> <b>critic</b> Edgar Allan Poe. Not reprinted until 2002, Mary Shelley's biographies have until recently received little academic appreciation.|$|E

5|$|The {{tower was}} built for William Thomas Beckford, a rich novelist, art {{collector}} <b>and</b> <b>critic,</b> to designs by Henry Goodridge and completed in 1827. Beckford {{used it as a}} library and a retreat, with the cupola at the top acting as a belvedere providing views over the surrounding countryside. The Italianate building {{at the base of the}} tower housed drawing rooms and a library. Extensive grounds between Beckford's house in Lansdown Crescent were landscaped and planted to create Beckford's Ride.|$|E
5|$|Two {{approaches}} have dominated {{explanations of the}} story of the green children: that it is a folktale describing an imaginary encounter with the inhabitants of another world, perhaps subterranean or even extraterrestrial, or it is a garbled account of a historical event. The story was praised as an ideal fantasy by the English anarchist poet <b>and</b> <b>critic</b> Herbert Read in his English Prose Style, published in 1931. It provided the inspiration for his only novel, The Green Child, written in 1934.|$|E
5|$|A modernist painter, Bellette was {{influential}} in mid-twentieth century Sydney art circles. She frequently painted scenes {{influenced by the}} Greek tragedies of Euripides and Sophocles and the epics of Homer. The only woman to have won the Sulman Prize more than once, Bellette claimed the accolade in 1942 with For Whom the Bell Tolls, and in 1944 with Iphigenia in Tauris. She helped found the Blake Prize for Religious Art, and was its inaugural judge. Bellette married artist <b>and</b> <b>critic</b> Paul Haefliger in 1935. The couple moved to Majorca in 1957; although she visited and exhibited in Australia thereafter, she did not return there to live, and became peripheral to the Australian art scene.|$|E

50|$|Similarly {{to that of}} Mao, Chiang is {{regarded}} as a controversial figure; supporters credit him with playing a major part in the Allied victory of the Second World War; detractors <b>and</b> <b>critics</b> denounce him as a dictator at the front of an authoritarian autocracy who suppressed and purged opponents <b>and</b> <b>critics</b> <b>and</b> arbitrarily incarcerated those he deemed as opposing to the Kuomintang among others.|$|R
5|$|According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center {{has long}} labored to legalize its monopolistic {{position}} of the Main expert institution of the country. The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center {{to get in touch}} over the telephone with the judges and explain to them who is who and what is the guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have {{turned out to be a}} considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions. Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer <b>and</b> <b>critic</b> of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs. Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{literary}} critics Maman S. Mahayana, Oyon Sofyan, and Achmad Dian, Hasan's psychological struggles reflect Sigmund Freud's theories on psychoanalysis. Teeuw notes that Hasan {{comes across as}} being disappointed that his traditional religious upbringing {{is not enough to}} overcome the temptations of the modern world. Poet <b>and</b> <b>critic</b> of Indonesian literature Muhammad Balfas writes that Hasan's conflict arises from being torn intellectually between the teachings of his ultra-religious father and the Marxist Rusli, {{while at the same time}} being emotionally victimised by the ever self-confident Anwar. Balfas notes that three versions of Hasan are made apparent to the reader: Hasan's view of himself, the narrator's view of Hasan, and the narrator's reconstruction of Hasan.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} {{her mother had}} died, and Bryher had {{divorced}} her husband, only to marry H.D.'s new male lover, Kenneth Macpherson. H.D., Bryher, and Macpherson lived together and traveled through Europe as what the poet <b>and</b> <b>critic</b> Barbara Guest termed in her biography of H.D. as a 'menagerie of three.' Bryher and Macpherson adopted H.D.'s daughter, Perdita. In 1928, H.D. became pregnant but chose to abort the pregnancy in November. Bryher and Macpherson set up the magazine Close Up (to which H.D. regularly contributed) as a medium for intellectual discussion of cinema. In 1927, the small independent film cinema group POOL or Pool Group was established (largely funded with Bryher's inheritance) and was managed by all three. Only one POOL film survives in its entirety, Borderline (1930), which featured H.D. and Paul Robeson in the lead roles. In common with the Borderline novellas, the film explores extreme psychic states {{and their relationship to}} surface reality. As well as acting in this film, H.D. wrote an explanatory pamphlet to accompany it, a piece later published in Close Up.|$|E
