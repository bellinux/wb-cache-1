30|$|CubeSats {{offer the}} {{potential}} to accelerate the development of quantum technologies in space by offering reliable and cost-effective platforms for conducting in-orbit technology demonstrations. The cost-effectiveness of CubeSats {{is derived from the}} standard containers used to ship and deploy CubeSats. This has led to the ability to share launch costs between a large number of users. At the same time, advances in micro-electronics and RF communication have enabled many advanced experiments to be operable remotely, using only COTS components. Together, these advances have made in-orbit experiments <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> <b>university</b> groups and consortia that were not space users, even a decade previously.|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: Corporate {{members have}} {{important}} legal rights that {{are incorporated into}} the statutory and common law of Australia. These members’ rights serve as a protective mechanism against abuse and mismanagement by those that govern corporate business. Australian universities are statutory corporations, {{some of which have}} statutory member provisions in their enabling legislation. Universities are being forced to venture further into commercial operations to survive and in some instances are undertaking unacceptable risks in their commercial activities. Some universities are experiencing difficult financial times and the following question is raised: What avenues do <b>university</b> <b>members</b> have <b>to</b> protect themselves where their university’s commercial ventures threaten to undermine the core purpose of higher education? The presentation will discuss some legal characteristics of Australian public universities as they relate <b>to</b> <b>university</b> <b>members</b> and members rights...|$|R
