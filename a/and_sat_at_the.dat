25|$|In September 1951 Clapp {{resigned}} {{for health}} reasons but continued {{to act as a}} consultant to the Department of Shipping and Transport. On 14 July 1952 the first of the B class diesel electric locomotives, which were to revolutionise train operations in Victoria, was delivered to the VR and travelled from NSW to Melbourne's Spencer Street Station under its own power. The elderly Harold Clapp climbed into the cab of locomotive B 60 <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> controls, and was honoured by having the new locomotive named after him.|$|E
25|$|To date Carlisle United {{have played}} 82 {{seasons in the}} Football League, their relegation in 2004 and {{reinstatement}} the following year remains the only departure from the Football League since the club was first admitted in 1928 (excluding wartime). United are currently the only club to have reached {{the final of the}} Football League Trophy on six occasions. This, this alongside their two wins, makes them the most successful club in the competition's history. The club's highest achievement outside of cup competitions came in 1974 when the club was promoted to the first tier of English football <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of the league there for short time. Carlisle still remains the smallest location in England, by local population, to have had a resident top-flight football team since 1906.|$|E
500|$|John Hay {{was sworn}} in as Secretary of State on September 30, 1898. He needed little {{introduction}} to Cabinet meetings, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> President's right hand. [...] Meetings were held in the Cabinet Room of the White House, where he found his old office and bedroom each occupied by several clerks. Now responsible for 1,300 federal employees, he leaned heavily for administrative help on his old friend Alvey Adee, the second assistant.|$|E

2500|$|Later, in the All Party negotiations, {{he led the}} UUP {{delegation}} <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{table with}} Sinn Féin, though in the eight months of the negotiations he never spoke directly to their leader, Gerry Adams. [...] The talks were successful, culminating in the Belfast Agreement of 10 April 1998, which resulted in power-sharing with Nationalists. On 22 May 1998, voters in Northern Ireland approved the agreement, with 71 per cent in favour.|$|E
2500|$|The {{commission}} {{began its}} work on 1 October. Amongst the first tasks was a hearing from two {{representatives of the}} miners who asked for a two-week postponement, which was rejected by Farlam. He also took a personal tour of {{the site of the}} protests. On the first day, he toured the site of the shootings hearing from the forensic expert who had examined the site <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> koppie (hill) where the miners hid from police. On the second day, he went to see the miners' dormitories—including where families can stay and an informal settlement. Al Jazeera's Tania Page said that the site had been cleaned since the incident and that the commission's challenge would be [...] "to see the truth and find an objective balance when all the parties involved have had time to cover their tracks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the report}} of Tamar in [...] "She sat in the gate of Enaim," [...] Rabbi Alexander taught that Tamar went <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{entrance}} of the place of Abraham, the place to which all eyes ( [...] , einaim) look. Alternatively, Rav Hanin said {{in the name of}} Rav that there is a place called Enaim, and it is the same place mentioned in [...] when it speaks of [...] "Tappuah and Enam." [...] Alternatively, Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani taught that the place is called Enaim because Tamar gave eyes ( [...] , einaim) to her words; that is, Tamar gave convincing replies to Judah's questions. When Judah solicited her, he asked her if she was a Gentile, and she replied that she was a convert. When Judah asked her if she was a married woman, she replied that she was unmarried. When Judah asked her if perhaps her father had accepted marriage proposals on her behalf betrothals (making her forbidden to Judah), she replied that she was an orphan. When Judah asked her if perhaps she was ritually unclean (because she was a menstruant, or niddah, and thus forbidden to Judah), she replied that she was clean..|$|E

60|$|Slowly old Jolyon got {{up out of}} his chair, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{table to}} eat his dinner.|$|R
60|$|He {{broke off}} with a vague gesture, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> others vacantly with his lean face furrowed.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{were they}} very merry, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table a long time, talking of many things. Then {{said the old}} gentleman, My good landlord, while we are {{cracking}} your nuts, if you please, do you open this riddle:[234] ...|$|E
60|$|He moved cheerfully {{about the}} room, and {{she watched him}} all the time with almost pathetic earnestness. Presently he brought the breakfast things over to her side <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> foot of her couch while the water boiled. He took her hand and held it caressingly.|$|E
6000|$|... "The sun sank; {{the short}} {{twilight}} came and went. I had some tea, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table thinking and dreaming over it. When I roused myself {{and went back}} to the window, the moon was up; but the quiet sea was as quiet as ever.|$|E
60|$|And as the Seer spoke, {{the awful}} Presence glided out of Nothingness, <b>and</b> <b>sat,</b> sphinx-like, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{feet of the}} Alchemist.|$|R
60|$|Kramer {{went into}} the control room <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> control board. Looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> useless {{apparatus}} made him feel strange.|$|R
60|$|Dinner-time came, <b>and</b> Emily <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> drawing-room {{window with}} Claude and Lilias, lamenting her cousin's bad habits. 'Nothing will ever make him punctual,' said she.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{went to his}} head. He took {{a bedroom}} in Pall Mall <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window with an {{electric}} rifle picking them off on the door-steps of the clubs. It was a noble idea, {{but of course it}} imperilled the very existence of the society. He was a curate." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{attendant}} {{did as she}} was told: {{shaking her}} head meanwhile, to intimate that the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she resumed her seat {{by the side of}} the other nurse, who had by this time returned. The mistress, with an expression of impatience, wrapped herself in her shawl, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> foot of the bed.|$|E
60|$|The King {{had moved}} into the Council Chamber, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table with an open {{telegraph}} dispatch before him. Baron Doxis, the President of the House of Laws, was {{on one side of}} him, and Brand on the other. Effenden Pascha knew very well what was coming. The King looked at him, and there was an added sense of power in the grave, soldierly face.|$|E
60|$|Christian rose, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> writing-table. A whisper startled her. It {{came from}} Dominique, {{who was holding}} {{out a pair of}} boots.|$|R
60|$|So {{she went}} away, and Catherine took her work <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window. Suddenly the door burst open, and in came her Destiny.|$|R
60|$|Walthew {{pulled up}} his mule <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> gazing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> town. He had been riding beside Blanca, while Father Agustin {{and two others}} {{followed}} at some distance.|$|R
60|$|When the fooling was ended {{all hands}} made {{a raid on}} Joe's big coffee- pot by the fire for a Java nightcap. Ranse watched the new knight {{carefully}} {{to see if he}} understood and was worthy. Curly limped with his cup of coffee to a log and sat upon it. Long Collins followed and sat by his side. Buck Rabb went <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other. Curly--grinned.|$|E
60|$|There came {{in three}} peasants {{in the black}} and white costume, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> middle table. They kept on their {{stocking}} caps. And queer they looked, coming in with slow, deliberate tread of these elderly men, and sitting rather remote, with a gap of solitude around them. The peculiar ancient loneliness of the Sardinian hills clings to them, and something stiff, static, pre-world.|$|E
60|$|All {{night there}} were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places {{instead of to}} London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now pigs, now men,--never horses. Fantastic {{failures}} of journeys occupied me until the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and partly dressed, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window to take a last look out, and in taking it fell asleep.|$|E

60|$|For {{a moment}} or two he seemed quite lost in contemplating the pace of this ideal timepiece, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> boy as if his face were the dial.|$|R
60|$|Then he shut <b>the</b> box <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{table to}} think, opening the {{sluice-gates}} {{of his mind}} and letting the sea of misery flow in, as it were.|$|R
60|$|Three {{feet from}} their table was the {{telephone}} booth. Kernan went inside <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> instrument, leaving the door open. He found a {{number in the}} book, took down the receiver and made his demand upon Central. Woods sat still, looking at the sneering, cold, vigilant face waiting close to the transmitter, {{and listened to the}} words that came from the thin, truculent lips curved into a contemptuous smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{say that}} I have any," [...] he admitted. [...] "It was Kendricks who took me. He is showing me Paris--Paris {{from his own}} point of view. He took me first to a restaurant, where we dined for two francs <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same table with those people to whom he is now making himself so agreeable. Kendricks has {{democratic}} instincts. His latest fad {{is to try and}} instil them into me." ...|$|E
60|$|Kitty {{rose and}} dressed herself, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window, {{and watched the}} morning come into the garden below: first, a tremulous flush of the heavens; then a rosy light on the silvery roofs and gables; then little golden aisles among the lilacs and hollyhocks. The tiny flower-beds just under her window were left, with their snap-dragons and larkspurs, in dew and shadow; the small dog stood on the threshold, and barked uneasily when the bell rang in the Ursulines' Chapel, where the nuns were at matins.|$|E
60|$|His joy was boundless. When he {{returned}} from combing his hair in <b>the</b> bedroom <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> small table opposite her, he paused with knife and fork in hand.|$|R
60|$|Archie felt stimulated. Not {{even the}} advent of his father-in-law, who came {{in a few moments}} later <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other end of the room, could depress his spirits.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they went}} down to the water and took barge, and laid the corpse therein; and Godiva <b>and</b> Hereward <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead lad's head; and Winter steered the boat, and Gwenoch took the stroke-oar.|$|R
