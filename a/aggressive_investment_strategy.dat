5000|$|During 1999, Enron {{initiated}} EnronOnline, an Internet-based trading operation, {{which was}} used by virtually every energy company in the United States. Enron {{president and chief operating}} officer Jeffrey Skilling began advocating a novel idea: the company didn't really need any [...] "assets". By promoting the company's <b>aggressive</b> <b>investment</b> <b>strategy,</b> he helped make Enron the biggest wholesaler of gas and electricity, trading over $27 billion per quarter. The corporation's financial claims, however, had to be accepted at face value. Under Skilling, Enron adopted mark to market accounting, in which anticipated future profits from any deal were tabulated as if currently real. Thus, Enron could record gains from what over time might turn out to be losses, as the company's fiscal health became secondary to manipulating its stock price on Wall Street during the so-called Tech boom. But when a company's success is measured by undocumented financial statements, actual balance sheets are inconvenient. Indeed, Enron's unscrupulous actions were often gambles to keep the deception going and so increase the stock price. An advancing price meant a continued infusion of investor capital on which debt-ridden Enron in large part subsisted (much like a financial [...] "pyramid" [...] or [...] "Ponzi scheme"). Attempting to maintain the illusion, Skilling verbally attacked Wall Street Analyst Richard Grubman, who questioned Enron's unusual accounting practice during a recorded conference telephone call. When Grubman complained that Enron was the only company that could not release a balance sheet along with its earnings statements, Skilling replied [...] "Well, thank you very much, we appreciate that ... asshole." [...] Though the comment was met with dismay and astonishment by press and public, it became an inside joke among many Enron employees, mocking Grubman for his perceived meddling rather than Skilling's offensiveness. When asked during his trial, Skilling declared that industrial dominance and abuse was a global problem: [...] "Oh yes, yes sure, it is." ...|$|E

We briefly review the basic demographic and economic trends that motivate {{the establishment of}} the Fund. We consider the pitfalls facing the operation of the Fund and argue that a complete ban on domestic investment would minimise the politicisation problem. At least initially, the Fund should adopt an <b>aggressive</b> <b>investment</b> <b>strategy,</b> with a large equity allocation. We further argue that asset allocation should take into account the co-variation of returns with domestic macroeconomic and fiscal variables.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a time-continuous goal-based portfolio selection model with cumulative prospect theory preferences and satisficing behavior, where investors optimally split their wealth among several investment goals at different horizons. The paper extends {{the model of}} Berkelaar, Kouwenberg and Post (2004) to account for multiple-goals. We show that when the discounted values of all target wealths is not too high relative to the initial wealth (i. e., goals are not too ambitious), investors mainly invest to reach short-term investment goals and adopt safe <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> for this purpose. However, when goals are very ambitious, they put {{a high proportion of}} their wealth in long-term goals and adopt <b>aggressive</b> <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> with high leverage to reach short-term goals and the overall <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> also displays high leverage.

The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to test empirically whether this holds good, when all background risks are taken into account. I use a unique data on premium pension portfolio choices for 11 000 individuals, eligible in a new public defined-contribution pension system that was initiated in Sweden in 2000, matched with the Swedish Household Survey on Income for 1999. Unlike previous studies, the current data does not suffer from any particular job/occupational selection, and it covers a wider range of income distribution. Further, I use a more refined definition of risk (which is commonly defined as the share of stocks), namely the average standard deviation of a fund’s performance for the three preceding years. Thus the risk measure used here is more accurate, as well as taking into account that, even with a low share of stocks, funds can be considerably risky. The findings of this paper suggest that almost all individuals chose a fairly <b>aggressive</b> <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> with almost the whole portfolio invested in stock funds.

40|$|The declining cost of {{information}} technology (IT) over time provides the later entrant in information-intensive industries a cost advantage. On the other hand, the earlier entrant {{has the potential to}} build and retain its market share if consumers incur a cost in switching to the later entrant. We investigate the impact of a decline in the IT cost and the switching cost on IT investment strategies of firms. We find that a declining IT cost always hurts the early entrant's profit. The early entrant may assume an <b>aggressive</b> <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> or a defensive investment strategy in response to a decline in the IT cost, depending on whether the switching cost relative to the extent of decline in the IT cost is high or low, respectively. A decline in IT cost also hurts the later entrant's profit if the switching cost is high. A surprising result is that when the decline in the IT cost is higher than a critical value, a higher switching cost increases consumer surplus. When firms control the switching cost, the early entrant increases its investment in quality and switching cost and maintains its quality and its market-share leadership irrespective of the extent of decline in the IT cost.

40|$|In {{the early}} 50 's, Markowitz {{introduced}} the modern portfolio selection theory which, {{to this very}} day, constitutes the basis of many investment decisions. Given different correlated assets, how does an investor create a portfolio maximizing the expected utility? Markowitz's contribution was to show that an investor might do very well, relying only on the means and variances/covariances of the assets, which simplifies the portfolio selection tremendously. The validity of the mean-variance approximation to exact utility maximization has been verified, {{but only in the}} unrealistic case of choosing among 10 - 20 securities. This paper examines how well the quadratic approximation works in a larger allocation problem, where investors characterized by different utility functions can choose among nearly 120 securities.

First, intergenerational fairness is imposed by requiring that the pension fund is driven towards a steady state.

For a simple contract approximate analytical results are available and accurate, whereas for a more involved contract Monte Carlo methods must be applied {{to pick out the}} best design. The main insights are (i) <b>aggressive</b> <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> are disastrous for the clients; (ii) in most cases it is optimal to gear the bonus reserve; and (iii) the results are far less sensitive to the agent's risk aversion than in the classical case of Merton (1969), and as opposed to Merton horizon matters even with constant investment opportunities (because of the serial dependence between bonuses). ...|$|R
40|$|This work explores whether <b>aggressive</b> {{accounting}} <b>investment</b> <b>strategies,</b> {{when applied}} to firms, are able to generate abnormal stock returns for investors. Metrics based on accruals, leverage and capital expenditures {{have been developed to}} build trading rules. Empirical results show that such accounting-information based trading rules can bring about positive abnormal returns which are relatively stable from buy-and-hold strategies as well as from hedging strategies. Also, industry affiliation exists in terms of aggressive accounting. High accruals, leverage and capital expenditure have both favourable aspects which can lead to positive abnormal returns, and unfavourable aspects which can result in negative abnormal returns. The conflicting driving elements work under different conditions. Thus, the empirical results from this paper suggest that there is no clear monotonic relationship between levels of aggressive accounting and abnormal returns...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Marikana {{incident}} in 2012, {{as well as}} the protracted strikes by platinum miners, metal and postal workers in 2014 suggest that not all is well in the South African labour market. Even though those in employment are better off than the unemployed poor, macroeconomic data indicates that labour’s share in Gross Value Added has declined significantly during the first two decades following the first democratic election in 1994. A falling share of labour in income also means, by definition, that average labour productivity growth outstrips real wages growth. Data for South Africa suggests that productivity has indeed increased faster than wages in South Africa. This article argues that financialisation and more <b>aggressive</b> returns-oriented <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> applied by for instance large investment institutions translated into higher required rates of return on capital, which in turn caused an increased implementation of capital-augmenting labour-saving technology that reduces labour’s share in income...|$|R
40|$|The era of {{globalization}} has produced previously unimaginable economic benefits by spurring linkages between countries through trade and foreign investment. This new found interconnectivity, however, also raises national security concerns for countries, {{such as the}} United States, that welcome foreign investment {{in the form of}} mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers. Part II highlights one such threat stemming from the rise of China and its <b>aggressive</b> foreign <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> to acquire American companies in industries critical to national security. In response to the growing threat of economic espionage from foreign investors, the United States created the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) —a national security review process for foreign mergers and acquisitions. Part III analyzes the evolution of CFIUS, while Part IV introduces China’s freshly minted model for analogous national security reviews. Given the rise of these dueling frameworks in the world’s two largest economies, critics contend that such national security reviews inject non-transparency, uncertainty, and politics into viable investment opportunities.

We then simulate hedge fund returns from this joint density in order to compute CVaR, CDaR and Omega, which {{are used in the}} optimization process. We compare the semi-parametric approach with the standard, non-parametric approach, in which the quantiles of the marginal density of portfolio returns are estimated empirically and used to compute CVaR, CDaR and Omega. We report two main findings. The first is that the CVaR, CDaR and Omega models offer a significant improvement in terms of risk-adjusted portfolio performance over the mean-variance model. The second is that semi-parametric estimation of the CVaR, CDaR and Omega models offers a very substantial improvement over non-parametric estimation.
