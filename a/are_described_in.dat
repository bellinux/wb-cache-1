5|$|In later medieval prayers, Elves {{appear as}} a threatening, even demonic, force. For example, there are prayers which invoke God's help against noctural attacks by Alpe. Correspondingly, in the early modern period, elves <b>are</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> north Germany doing the evil bidding of witches; Martin Luther {{believed}} his mother to have been afflicted in this way.|$|E
5|$|Many {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed for animal navigation: there is evidence {{for a number of}} them.

5|$|After {{a series}} of {{political}} and military machinations conducted by the U.S., the Pathet Lao, and the North Vietnamese in Laos that <b>are</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> the History of Laos since 1945, a Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos was signed in Geneva, Switzerland on 23 July 1962. The agreement, an attempt to end a civil war between the Communist-dominated (and Hanoi-directed) Pathet Lao, neutralists, and American-backed rightists, included provisions that required the removal of all foreign military forces and precluded the use of Lao territory for interfering {{in the internal affairs}} of another country – a blatant effort to shut down North Vietnam's growing logistical corridor through southeastern Laos that would become known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E

30|$|A {{clustering}} {{based on}} weight of link or edge connecting event pair as has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [89]. A MMHP (Marked Multivariate “Hawkes” Process) algorithm utilizes textual information cluster for activation of events into different clusters and the HTM (“Hawkes” Topic Model) algorithm models {{the evolution of}} textual information with Correlated Topic Model (CTM) through cascade of topics as has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [90]. A concept of role of macro action has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [91] where this macro action satisfies a sub-goal. The clustering of documents based on shared aspect or topic or event or sub-topic, or sub-event has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [18, 92 – 94].|$|R
30|$|The {{issues of}} trust and {{provenance}} have <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [37, 38] where {{every state in the}} provenance graph has been associated with an activity. The security or access restrictions or storage constraints of data base access and the concept of associating cost with trust has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [3]. The use of information cascades for tracing the path associated with a piece of news has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [6]. A news article has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> as having <b>been</b> influenced or transformed with edit activities which define the path of provenance to the final version of news as <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [7].

The situation trust values which have been averaged over all situations to determine the trust in an agent of interest as has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [44]. A provenance system has been defined [4, 45] on collection of subjects s, objects o, and attributes a. A subject s 1 with attribute set a 1 performs an action. A migration policy decision has been taken based on input object o 1 and attribute set a 1 associated with subject s 1 and the state reached as a result of migration.

5|$|Many English villages {{were given}} their shape in this period, {{and almost all}} <b>are</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> some detail in the {{eleventh}} century Domesday Book.

5|$|Notable {{figures in}} the center of the painting, to the left of Małachowski, include other {{supporters}} of the Constitution. Priest Hugo Kołłątaj (11) is the most prominent, gesturing in disdain at Suchorzewski. Several other {{figures in the}} vicinity <b>are</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> sources, but their precise location is unclear, or the sources contradict one another. The priest holding the Bible (12) is probably Feliks Turski, although some identify him as Tymoteusz Gorzeński. The figures to the right of Kołłątaj represents the Grand Lithuanian Marshal, Ignacy Potocki (13), and perhaps Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski (14) (although some sources identify Czartoryski elsewhere in the painting, in the vicinity of Kościuszko). Surrounding Kołłątaj are likely the priest Scipione Piattoli (15) and Tadeusz Matuszewicz or Matusiewicz (16).|$|E

30|$|The {{process of}} {{adapting}} classifier {{to the situation}} of change has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [120]. A concept drift can happen if prior probabilities of classes defined on target variables change, or if conditional probabilities associating the target class variable and input variable changes, with a corresponding impact of change on posterior probabilities [120]. The ensemble learning methods produce models that are either homogenous or heterogeneous. Homogenous algorithms which use the same algorithm with different parameter either by introducing randomness or by manipulating input attributes, model outputs or training instances with a process of “bagging” or “boosting” as has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [121]. The explore vs exploit strategies for selecting actions has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [120]. Reinforcement learning algorithm has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> as where all state action pairs have been observed and top updated Q values have been retained for future processing as has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [122]. The reward function values impact distance measures used by the clustering algorithm [122]. The three heuristics for credit assignments [27] have <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [123]. Constraint Satisfaction and Emerging Algorithm based on Set Covering Problem Solutions have <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [124]. A survey of set covering problem solutions has been provided in [33]. A combination of partitioning and agglomerative clustering algorithm has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [35] where the data points have been partitioned and then clustered maintaining {{the total number of}} identified partitions. A method of merging models using agglomerative clustering approach where models have been merged based on a maximum classification likelihood measure has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [36].
