5|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> term of {{negotiations}} between the parties, IUPAC decided to allow the name seaborgium for element 106 and changed the name of element 102 to flerovium after Georgy Flerov following the recognition by the 1993 report that the element had been first convincingly synthesized in Dubna. However, this compromise was also rejected by the American scientists and the decision was retracted. The name flerovium was later used for element 114.|$|E
5|$|Following their defeat, straggling gendarmes retreated {{back into}} Angola. Tshombe began {{planning}} {{to use them}} to stage an invasion of the Congo, but this was cut short by his imprisonment in 1967. They reconstituted themselves as the Front de Libération Nationale Congolaise and made two attempts retake Katanga in the 1970s. Both failed, but secessionist insurgency activity continued. Hostilities resurfaced in 2006 <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> national constitution, which promulgated the division of Katanga into four new provinces, was adopted.|$|E
5|$|Hawaiian volcanoes {{follow a}} {{well-established}} {{life cycle of}} growth and erosion. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> volcano forms, its lava output gradually increases. Height and activity both peak when the volcano is around 500,000 years old and then rapidly decline. Eventually it goes dormant, and eventually extinct. Erosion then weathers the volcano until it again becomes a seamount.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the oath, the monarch may take {{what is known as}} the Accession Declaration if he or she has not yet made it.

5|$|On March 8, 2000 – {{the year}} <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{constitution}} {{was introduced in}} Venezuela – it was decreed that the Metropolitan District of Caracas would be created, {{and that some of}} the powers of El Hatillo Municipality would be delegated to the Alcaldía Mayor, which would also govern the Baruta, Libertador, Sucre and Chacao municipalities. Each of the five municipalities is divided into parishes; El Hatillo has only one, the Santa Rosalía de Palermo Parish, sometimes called Santa Rosalía de El Hatillo Parish or simply El Hatillo Parish.|$|E
5|$|The {{seat of the}} {{municipal}} government is El Hatillo Town, founded in 1784 by Don Baltasar de León, who {{was instrumental in the}} area's development. Although the town had its origins during the Spanish colonisation, {{the municipal}}ity was not established until 1991. In 2000 – the year <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> constitution was enacted in Venezuela – some of the municipality functions were delegated to a consolidated mayor's office called Alcaldía Mayor, which also has some authority over the other four municipalities of Caracas.|$|E

5|$|Aarhus has {{increasingly}} been investing in environmental planning and, {{in accordance with}} national policy, aims to be CO2 neutral and independent of fossil fuels for heating by 2030.

In 2015, the municipality took over three private straw-fired heating plants and the year <b>after,</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> 77 MW {{combined heat and power}} biomass plant at Lisbjerg Power Station was completed while Studstrup Power Station finished a refit to move from coal to wood chips. In conjunction with the development of the Docklands district there are plans for a utility scale seawater heat pump which will take advantage of fluctuating electricity prices to supply the district heating system.|$|E
5|$|Compulsory {{education}} or grunnskóli (lit. “basic school”), is {{the period of}} education which is compulsory for all. The legislation concerning compulsory education was passed in 2007, and in 1996 municipalities took over the running of compulsory education. It comprises primary and lower secondary education, which often {{takes place at the}} same institution. The law states that education is mandatory for children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 16. The school year lasts nine months, and begins between August 21 and September 1, ending between May 31 and June 10. The minimum number of school days is 170, but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> teachers’ wage contract, this will increase to 180. Lessons take place five days a week.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1955 cricket season, Headley {{was invited}} to become a {{national}} coach, a post created by the Jamaican government, which involved working mainly with young people. Headley and his second son travelled back to Jamaica, {{while the rest of}} the family remained in England. Headley had a heavy workload, particularly in rural areas; together with his assistant Dickie Fuller his role involved encouraging school children to watch and play cricket, and trying to improve standards and facilities throughout the country. Headley became involved in the selection of teams, taking some of them overseas. At this time, he discovered the future West Indian Test player Roy Gilchrist and future Jamaican cricketer Henry Sewell. However, critics in the 1960s complained that there were not enough Jamaicans in the Test side and blamed Headley and Fuller, although the government remained supportive of their performance. In 1961, Headley coached for six months in Nigeria and earned praise from the Nigerian Cricket Association. His official coaching role in Jamaica ended <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> government withdrew funding for coaching in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{planning}} of the segment between Barkåker and Tønsberg considered 13 different initial route proposals. However, no analysis for possible rights-of-way south of Tønsberg or north of Barkåker were considered. In September 1999, the government presented their proposal for National Transport Plan 2002–11, which included three segments on the Vestfold Line: Holm–Nykirke, Barkåker–Tønsberg and Farriseidet–Porsgrunn. When Parliament passed {{the plan in}} February 2001, the Barkåker–Tønsberg segment was prioritized second on the Vestfold Line, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> passing loop at Nykirke. National Transport Plan 2002–11 proposed that construction start in 2005, but by November 2002, the National Rail Administration delayed the plans, following investment cuts by Bondevik's Second Cabinet. In response, Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm stated that she was considering financing the project as a public–private partnership paid through a surcharge on tickets fares.|$|E

At around the same time, teams that had been observing the West Side Boys' base for four days reported that they had seen no sign of the captive soldiers in that time. There were also concerns that an assault would become more dangerous if the West Side Boys moved the hostages. The combination of these factors led COBRA to order an extraction mission.|$|E

5|$|The {{base of the}} Conn Smythe Trophy {{has been}} {{expanded}} twice {{over the years to}} accommodate more winners.

Following the 2000 Stanley Cup Finals, the 20 nameplates on the new tier were filled up, so the first nine winners' nameplates were moved up to the remaining three sides of the foundation tier, with the remaining nameplates shifted accordingly to keep the winners in chronological order. Due to the cancellation of the 2004-05 season, the trophy wasn't filled up again until , after which a new tier was added, making room for 24 more names.|$|E
5|$|The dam {{was built}} by the Alaska-Gastineau Mining Company to meet the {{electrical}} energy needs for mining operations. The dam continues to be fully functional for hydroelectric generation, {{as one of the}} drinking water sources to Juneau city and for aquaculture and fishing. When built, adoption of the constant arch design for the dam reduced costs by 20% because less concrete was needed to construct the dam. Of the two hydroelectric power stations built at the initial stage (one at the upper level and the other at the lower level) – the latter one is still in use <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> powerhouse was built adjoining the old one – it produces the inexpensive electricity in Alaska while meeting 10% of the energy needs of Juneau city. When built, the dam and its two power plants were considered engineering wonders. Both are operated and maintained by the Alaska Electric Light & Power (AEL).|$|E

Club records announced in November 2012 revealed that gross debt had fallen to £359.7million after the share sale paid off £62.6million of bonds.
