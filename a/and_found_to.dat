5|$|A {{review of}} spectacled warbler records was {{initiated}} in 1984. This review {{resulted in the}} species being removed from the British list; of the three accepted records, one, at Spurn, Yorkshire in 1968, was re-identified as a first-year female subalpine warbler, while descriptions of the other two, at Porthgwarra, Cornwall in October 1969 and on Fair Isle in June 1979, were not considered sufficiently watertight to permit their continued acceptance. Spectacled warbler has since been re-added to the British list following an individual at Filey, Yorkshire in 1992, {{and there have been}} further subsequent records. In the late 1990s, BBRC reviewed some of the accepted records of moustached warbler, and concluded that one, from Sussex in 1979, was unacceptable, but that one other, from Buckinghamshire in 1965, should stand. Two further records, from Hampshire in 1951 and Kent in 1952, were reviewed as part of the 1950–1957 review (see below), <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be unacceptable. Following these rejections, the Buckinghamshire record, and the remaining record, a breeding pair in Cambridgeshire in 1946, previously accepted as Britain's first, were scrutinised by the BOURC <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be unacceptable, leading to the removal of moustached warbler from the British list; it has not re-occurred.|$|E

Pigments, including a type of yellow pigment rarely found after 1600, were appropriate for the 16th century.

5|$|Deep Impact {{observed}} Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1) from February 20 to April 8, 2012, {{using its}} Medium Resolution Instrument, {{through a variety}} of filters. The comet was 1.75–2.11 astronomical units (AU) (2.62–3.16×108 km) from the Sun and 1.87–1.30 AU from the spacecraft. It was found that the outgassing from the comet varies with a period of 10.4 hours, which is presumed to be due to the rotation of its nucleus.

5|$|In {{identifying}} the remains {{as those of}} Palaeoscincus, Broom initially classified Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, a statement backed {{by the research of}} Coombs in the 1970s.

In 1981, the genus was reviewed with modern taxonomy, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be a valid genus of stegosaurid. However, a more recent 2008 review of Stegosauria could only identify one distinguishing feature, and while that study still referred it to Stegosauridae based on similarity, no diagnostic features of the family could be identified in Paranthodon.|$|E
