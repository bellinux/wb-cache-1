Before the dancing, our {{problems}} were really heavy to bear. Dancing takes our minds away from our problems. Our bodies became more healthy. As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help our case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E

Among those are 1,068 convicted war criminals, 14 {{of whom are}} A-Class (leading to the Yasukuni controversies). Another memorial at the Honden building commemorates anyone who died on behalf of Japan, but includes Koreans and Taiwanese who served Japan at the time.

25|$|The use of {{advanced}} triage may become necessary when medical professionals {{decide that the}} medical resources available are not sufficient to treat <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> need help. The treatment being prioritized can include the time spent on medical care, or drugs or other limited resources. This has happened in disasters such as terrorist attacks, mass shootings, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, and rail accidents. In these cases some percentage of patients will die regardless of medical care because {{of the severity of}} their injuries. Others would live if given immediate medical care, but would die without it.|$|E

25|$|Following the film's completion, Led Zeppelin had {{a falling}} out with Peter Clifton. Suspecting {{that he had}} 'stolen' negatives of the film, Grant ordered that his house be searched. They did find some footage, but {{this turned out to}} be a {{collection}} of the best 'home movie' footage which Clifton had intended to give to the band members as a gift. Clifton was also annoyed at the decision to remove from the film's credits the names of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had worked on editing, make up and effects. Unlike Massot, however, Clifton was invited to both the New York and London premieres of the film.|$|E

25|$|Hidalgo was {{met with}} an outpouring of support. Intellectuals, liberal priests and many poor people {{followed}} Hidalgo {{with a great deal}} of enthusiasm. Hidalgo permitted Indians and mestizos to join his war in such numbers that the original motives of the Querétaro group were obscured. Allende was Hidalgo's co-conspirator in Querétaro and remained more loyal to the Querétaro group's original, more creole objectives. However, Hidalgo's actions and the people's response, meant he would lead and not Allende. Allende had acquired military training when Mexico established a colonial militia; Hidalgo had no military training at <b>all.</b> <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> followed Hidalgo also had no military training, experience or equipment. Many of these people were poor who were angry after many years of hunger and oppression. Consequently, Hidalgo was the leader of undisciplined rebels.|$|E
25|$|The P.A.B.C. {{initiative}} (Public Art Building Communities), {{has allowed}} me to make a bridge between the community, the Restaurant Mama Ayesha’s, the arts and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have made this mural a reality. This could not be done without the support of all the community and the help of the DC Commission and the Restaurant and all the entities who funded the project. I hope that this mural will become a teaching tool of the History of the Presidents for schools, children and the public in general. This is a gift to the City of Washington DC to celebrate this historical moment in American History and will remain open to the public to see for generations to come. This is fulfilling the idea that mural art is available for the public and for the masses.|$|E

25|$|Limited atonement is {{contrasted with}} the view popularly termed {{unlimited}} atonement, which is advocated by Arminian, Methodist, Lutheran, Messianic Jewish, and Roman Catholic theologians (among others) and which says Christ's work makes redemption possible for all but certain for none. (This doctrine {{should not be confused}} with concepts of universal reconciliation, in which God saves his entire creation.) Though Lutherans and Catholics share a similar doctrine of the nature of the atonement with Calvinists, they differ on its extent, whereas Arminians and Methodists generally accept an alternate theory of the nature of the atonement such as the moral government theory. The elect in such models are <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> choose to avail themselves of God's gracious offer of salvation through Christ, not a pre-determined group. Thus, these systems place a limit on the efficacy of the atonement rather than on its extent, like Calvinists.|$|E
25|$|The Simpsons win a free spa weekend. At the spa, Homer {{is nearly}} {{killed when a}} mysterious person locks him into an {{incredibly}} hot steam room with a spanner. Fortunately for Homer, Krusty the Clown unlocks the door, letting an unconscious yet alive Homer out. This prompts Homer and Marge to see Chief Wiggum, who suggests that they seek help from someone who can understand a murderer's twisted mind– Sideshow Bob, who is released from prison, much to Bart's discomfort. To ensure Bart's safety, Wiggum places a shock bracelet on Sideshow Bob's ankle to keep his murderous urges at bay {{when he comes to}} live at the Simpson house. Sideshow Bob asks Homer to list <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> may want him dead, and decides to follow Homer around to investigate who the mystery assailant could be. During their day, they end up at a repair shop, where Homer chastises the mechanic, Junior.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of the term Mestizo (lit. mixed) has changed over time. The word was originally used in the colonial era to refer to individuals who were of half-Spanish and half-indigenous American ancestry. It {{was one of the}} many extant castes used to classify individuals. Once Mexico achieved its independence, the casta system was abandoned and mestizo was used to refer to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were mixed race. After the Mexican Revolution, the term became cultural and was used to refer to the segment of the Mexican population who did not speak indigenous languages. The term mestizo thus became a cultural identity that grouped racially mixed people (including African and Asian ancestry) and unmixed individuals with a mestizo culture. This change of definition was the product of an ideology known as “mestizaje” which was promoted by the early post-Revolution government, seeking to create a unified Mexican identity with no racial distinctions. The advent of DNA sequencing since then has allowed for the study of Mexico's mestizo population.|$|E
50|$|The Inca {{referred}} to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>who</b> were not under their empire as puruma auca. Because these Picunche tribes {{were successful in}} defending their territory against the Inca Empire in the Battle of the Maule, they were given this distinctive name. In an effort to transliterate the word into Spanish phonetics, the Spanish {{referred to}} them as the Purumaucas or Promaucaes. The early Spanish in the area knew their region as the province of Promaucae and its inhabitants were called Promaucaes.|$|R

500|$|Another {{method of}} {{peaceful}} protesting was {{demonstrated in the}} formation of Camp Solidarity which was located {{in the center of the}} protesting, in southern Virginia. Supporters came from all over the country to show their outrage against the actions of Pittston but there was no place that they could stay. Although many people in the local towns would offer shelter, they could not provide enough beds and food for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> came. Union member supporters found a solution to the problem. [...] A local recreational park near Castlewood, Virginia was turned into a campground where these supporters could stay. A small shelter equipped with bunk beds was built and an already existing snack bar was opened to provide food for the people staying at Camp Solidarity. Because the location was a recreational park, there was plenty of space for others to bring campers and tents into the area.|$|E

The video ends with a message that reads, [...] "This video is dedicated to the memory of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> died at [...] Pompeii." [...] The Beastie Boys claimed in interviews that the song and the video came about from their desire to progress from being a straightforward hip hop group and add vintage instruments and old sound equipment to their repertoire.|$|E

NMEs John Mulvey commented that Olivia's [...] "ruthlessness rather than her vocabulary" [...] was the standout, especially in the lyric: [...] "Shoulda known what you missed at home / Now you're all alone with no-one to bone".
