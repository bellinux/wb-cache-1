5|$|Peter Padfield's Hess, Hitler and Churchill (2013) {{explores the}} mystery of Hess's flight to Britain.

5|$|Although {{earmarked}} for operations <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, Luftflotte 2 {{remained in the}} west until May 1941. This was partly as a deception measure, and partly because new airbases in Poland could not be completed by 1 June 1941 target date, although they were made ready {{in time for the}} actual commencement of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941. Kesselring established his new headquarters at Bielany, a suburb of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|By early 1985, Reagan's anti-communist {{position}} {{had developed}} into a stance known as the new Reagan Doctrinewhich, in addition to containment, formulated an additional right to subvert existing communist governments. Besides continuing Carter's policy of supporting the Islamic opponents of the Soviet Union and the Soviet-backed PDPA government in Afghanistan, the CIA also sought to weaken the Soviet Union itself by promoting Islamism in the majority-Muslim Central Asian Soviet Union. Additionally, the CIA encouraged anti-communist Pakistan's ISI to train Muslims {{from around the world}} to participate in the jihad <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|E

The game was also costly for the Americans off-ice, as defenseman Jack O'Callahan pulled a ligament in his knee; however, Brooks kept O'Callahan on the roster which meant virtually playing with only 19 players throughout the tournament. O'Callahan would eventually return for <b>the</b> game <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> playing limited minutes.|$|R

They reunite in Berlin, with Hohenegg revealing to Max how he saved his life by convincing doctors at Stalingrad to operate on him and transport him back to Germany, rather than leaving him for dead. He is depicted at different points in the book.|$|E
5|$|In Moscow, Kennan again {{felt that}} his {{opinions}} were being ignored by Harry S. Truman and policymakers in Washington. Kennan tried repeatedly to persuade policymakers to abandon plans for {{cooperation with the}} Soviet government {{in favor of a}} sphere of influence policy in Europe to reduce the Soviets' power there. Kennan believed that a federation needed to be established in western Europe to counter Soviet influence in the region and to compete <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> stronghold in eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Planning for the {{operation}} started in December 1940. Erich Buschenhagen, {{chief of staff of}} Army of Norway visited Finland and drew up a plan which would determine Finland's role in the war, including the first draft of German-Finnish joint operations <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. On 8 December 1940 Hitler issued Directive No. 21, which detailed his plan for Operation Barbarossa as whole and included the targets for proposed German-Finnish cooperation. The detailed operational plan was created by Nikolaus von Falkenhorst with Army of Norway staff in January 1941.|$|E

Sborul and Smeul survived World War II, having been transferred to the Soviet Black Sea Fleet in late August 1944 after Romania changed sides and joined the Allies, serving as Musson and Toros respectively.|$|E
5|$|Upon retirement, Plante took a {{job with}} Molson as a sales {{representative}} but remained active in the NHL. In 1965, Scotty Bowman asked Plante {{to play for the}} Montreal Jr. Canadiens in a game <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> National Team. Honoured to represent his country, Plante agreed, and after receiving permission from both the Rangers (who owned his rights) and Molson, he began practicing. The Canadiens won 2–1, and Plante was named first star of the game.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} World War II, Soviet troops {{occupied}} the easternmost part of Denmark, and the Soviet Union wrote to the Danish government accusing Olga and a Danish Catholic bishop of conspiracy <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> government.

5|$|A {{small number}} of Ju 87s were also {{retained}} for anti-shipping operations in the Black Sea, a role it had proved so successful in when operating in the Mediterranean. In October 1943, this became evident again when StG 3 carried out several attacks <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Black Sea Fleet. On 6 October 1943 the most powerful flotilla in the fleet comprising the Leningrad class destroyers Kharkov, Besposhchadny and Sposobny were caught and sunk by dive -bombing. After the disaster, Josef Stalin decreed that no more ships were to pass within range of German aircraft without his personal permission.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{was chosen}} to {{participate}} in the 1984 Canada Cup. The roster included eight of Anderson's teammates from the Edmonton Oilers. Canada advanced to the finals and defeated Sweden 2–0 in a best of three series to win the Cup. Anderson scored five points during the tournament. The 1987 Canada Cup also saw Anderson participate. Once more, Canada reached the finals, but this time they were up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. The finals required all three games as Canada defeated the Soviet Union. All three games needed overtime and had a final score of 6–5. Anderson recorded three points during the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{exposed by}} Rolling Thunder was the unpreparedness of the Air Force for the {{operations}} it was undertaking. Its aircraft {{had been designed}} and its pilots trained for strategic operations <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union – for nuclear, not conventional war. The new campaign exposed years of neglect in conventional tactics, while aircraft capabilities and armament were ill-suited to the task at hand. The Air Force was also embarrassed {{by the fact that}} the Navy was better prepared. It possessed the only all-weather bomber in the U.S. inventory in the new A-6 Intruder and was also responsible for the development of the F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber, which became ubiquitous during the Vietnam War.|$|E
