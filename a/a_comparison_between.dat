5|$|As of 2008, {{there has}} been little {{response}} to Pozdniakov's approach. However, Sproat (2007) believes that the results from the frequency distributions are nothing more than an effect of Zipf's Law, and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language, so that <b>a</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> them is unlikely to be enlightening.|$|E
5|$|Tracy Flick {{has been}} a {{frequent}} point of comparison in commentary on real-world political figures. Hillary Clinton has more than once been compared to the character. In a January 2008 video mashup produced by Slate, campaign footage of Clinton was combined with clips from Election to draw <b>a</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> Clinton's and Tracy's feelings about the inferiority of their opponents. The video was widely circulated and praised.|$|E

5|$|Peter Donovan criticises the language-games {{approach}} {{for failing to}} recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such <b>a</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> beliefs is impossible. Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the apologetics of some, demonstrates that they {{interact with each other}} and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.|$|E
5|$|While Maud is {{described}} in the book as an attractive young woman, not a deformed monster, Uncle Silas is carefully written and plotted, and it is almost certain that Le Fanu explicitly intended <b>a</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> Maud's situation and {{the legend of the}} wealthy woman living in isolation and desired only for her money. Le Fanu spent his entire life in Dublin and was editor and proprietor of the Dublin University Magazine, and would certainly have been familiar with the legends of the pig-faced woman, and in particular the case of Griselda Steevens.|$|E
5|$|Greatschools.com {{awarded the}} school a perfect ten {{out of ten}} score, based on <b>a</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> the school's {{standardized}} test scores and those statewide; {{it is one of}} the few schools in California to be distinguished as such. In 2009, Dougherty had an Academic Performance Index rank of 905 out of a possible 1000, growing from the 2008 base score of 891. The school was the highest ranked high school in the SRVUSD, the 27th highest high school in the state, and the 744th highest school in the country by API score. In 2011, Dougherty Valley improved by 12 points the previous year with an API score of 921, making it the third highest high school in Contra Costa County as well as the top high school in SRVUSD. Dougherty Valley further improved with an API score of 937 in 2012.|$|E

25|$|Commenters on {{the ethnic}} or {{national}} origins of shanties, {{writing in the}} 19th century when shanties were still in wide use, generally supposed the genre to originate in America and recognized parallels to African-American singing—as opposed to earlier English traditions from Britain.
