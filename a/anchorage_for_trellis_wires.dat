40|$|Production Methods: In New York, both summer-bearing and fall-fruiting red {{raspberries}} are grown. For summer-bearing berries, {{the root}} system is perennial and plants {{are capable of}} living for several years. Their growth habit is to produce vegetative primocanes the first year, that then become flowering and fruiting floricanes the second year, which then die. Each established field will contain both primocanes and floricanes at the same time. Under ideal soil conditions and good cultural maintenance, a planting may remain productive for 10 or more years. Fall-fruiting or "everbearing " red raspberries produce fruits on the growing tips of primocanes. When the primocanes reach {{a certain number of}} nodes of growth, the apical meristem (growing tissue {{at the tip of the}} cane) changes from a vegetative to a reproductive state. Flower bud initiation continues from the top to the bottom of the cane. A raspberry field is established by planting certified, nursery grown rootstock. Plants are set 30 inches apart within rows, 9 to 10 feet between rows, and 1 inch deeper than they were grown in the nursery. The first year planting produces vegetative canes only (primocanes). In the fall, these primocanes are trained to a single <b>trellis</b> <b>wire</b> about 5 ft. from the ground. In mid-summer of the following season, these overwintering canes (now called floricanes) will flower and produce fruit. A new flush of primocanes begins to emerge from the root crown area every spring beginning in late March. Floricanes are cut out each fall after harvest, and the remaining primocanes are tied to the <b>trellis</b> <b>wire...</b>|$|R
40|$|Block {{codes are}} viewed from a formal {{language}} theoretic perspective. It is shown that properties of <b>trellises</b> <b>for</b> subclasses of block codes called rectangular codes follow naturally from the Myhill Nerode theorem. A technique termed subtrellis overlaying is introduced with the object of reducing decoder complexity. Necessary and sufficient conditions <b>for</b> <b>trellis</b> overlaying are derived from {{the representation of the}} block code as a group, partitioned into a subgroup and its cosets. The conditions turn out to be simple constraints on coset leaders. It is seen that overlayed trellises are tailbiting <b>trellises</b> <b>for</b> which decoding is generally more efficient than that <b>for</b> conventional <b>trellises.</b> Finally, a decoding algorithm <b>for</b> overlayed <b>trellises</b> is described, and the results of some simulations are presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The slope is the {{asymptotic}} {{growth rate}} of the active distances which are of particular interest {{for the design of}} trellis coded modulation schemes and concatenated codes. The higher the slope (growth rate) of the active burst distance, the better the error correcting capability of the code. In this paper we introduce the slope as a new parameter <b>for</b> <b>trellis</b> coded modulation and present a matrix based method for its computation. The example of a trellis code based on asymmetric 4 ASK will be used to illustrate the computation and the optimization of the slope. Simulation results confirm the improved error correcting capability <b>for</b> <b>trellis</b> codes with high slope. I...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{the concept}} of active distances, {{originally}} introduced for binary convolutional codes, was extended {{to the case of}} nonlinear trellis coded modulation. These distance measures allow an improved evaluation of the error correcting capability <b>for</b> <b>trellis</b> codes. Typically, the larger the slope of the active distances the better the performance of the <b>trellis</b> code <b>for</b> low 	. Moreover, these distance measures are of particular interest for the design of concatenated coding schemes, with respect to the choice of the inner trellis code as well as the interleaver. In this paper we present a matrix based method to compute the active distances <b>for</b> <b>trellis</b> codes in Euclidean space, encoded by an -state finite state machine. The computation is based on a simplified version of the distance generating matrix, which is well known from the calculation of the distance spectrum of trellis codes. In general the distance generating matrix is of size. We show that <b>for</b> <b>trellis</b> codes, encoded by an -state FSM, the distance generating matrix can always be reduced to fiffflffi !"ff. Finally, simulation results are presented that confirm the importance of the active distances. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Tail-biting <b>trellises</b> <b>for</b> block codes have {{considerably}} fewer {{number of}} states than conventional trellises and hence have potential for greatly improving the decoder performance. Although the formal theory <b>for</b> constructing such <b>trellises</b> is currently being worked out, a few tail-biting <b>trellises</b> <b>for</b> some linear block codes are available. Minimal tail-biting <b>trellis</b> <b>for</b> (15, 11) Reed Solomon code which belongs to a class of codes known as Maximum Distance Seperable(MDS) codes has been constructed based upon existing theorem. An efficient maximum likelihood soft-decision decoding algorithm <b>for</b> tail-biting <b>trellises</b> is proposed. Experiments indicate that the decoding algorithm is considerably more efficient than the traditional Viterbi algorithm run on the conventional trellis...|$|R
