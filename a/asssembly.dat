40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{two major}} projects in virtual reality, one involving a haptic interface {{and the other}} a locomotion interface. The Sarcos Dextrous Arm Master has been interfaced to a mechanical CAD system, to allow contact and manipulation forces with design artifacts to be reflected. The Sarcos Treadport locomotion interface comprises a special treadmill in a CAVE visual display. Locomotion rendering issues are discussed. 1 A Haptic Interface to a Mechanical CAD System The Sarcos Dextrous Arm Master has been interfaced to an advanced mechanical CAD system, Utah's Alpha 1. The goal is to add a sense of contact and manipulation to the usual visual displays of design artifacts. This includes tracing along surfaces while feeling realistic surface properties such as friction and hardness, grasping objects, performing <b>asssemblies,</b> and manipulating mechanisms. The benefits are projected to include an enhanced appreciation of a design, qualification of assembly forces, and ergonomics o [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Materials are {{manufactured}} from casting, forging and extrusion processes have higher typical dimension tolerences {{due to its}} producing ability. So machining processes were introduced for close tolerence <b>asssembly</b> and improve the product working efficiencies. In response, now a day’s lot of machining processes are available such as turning, milling, drilling and grinding to overcome these problems. Milling operation is playing vital role on making the components with high accuracy and higher productivity. Subsequently, face milling operation is utilized for planning the surface of workmaterial with improved surface texture. It {{is one of the}} important milling processes to achieve high flatness and low roughness. The work enlights the parameters influence on Material Removal Rate(MRR) and Surface Roughness (SR) in aluminium as a work piece material. In fact, aluminium alloy has the most significant in automobile and automation industries because of its inherent properties such as low weight to strength ratio. The selection of milling parameters such as spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut are essential for improving the productivity and part quality. This work formulates the relationship between input and response variables for improving the face milling performances. The Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is utilized for making the relationship between independent and dependent variables. Finally, the selection of the best parameter is important to the manufacturing industries in order to improve the productivity and product quality through scientific approach. The performance of RSM models show the developed empirical relationship and it has the best agreement with experimental results. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to select the optimal machiningparameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{computational}} {{design of}} new and interesting inorganic materials is still an ongoing challenge. The motivation of these efforts is to aid the often difficult task of crystal structure determination, to rationalize different but related structure types, or to help limit the domain of structures that are possible in a given system. Over the past decade, simulation methods have continuously evolved towards the prediction of new structures using minimal input information in terms of symmetry, cell parameters, or chemical composition. So far, this task of identifying candidate structures through {{an analysis of the}} energy landscape of chemical systems has been particularly successful for predominantly ionic systems with relatively small numbers of atoms or ions in the simulation cell. After an introductory section, the second section of this work presents the historical developments of such simulation methods in this area. The following sections of the work are dedicated to the introduction of the building unit concept in simulation methods: we present simulation approaches to structure prediction employing both primary (aggregate of atoms) and secondary (aggregate of coordination polyhedra) building units. While structure prediction with primary units is a straightforward extension of established approaches, the AASBU method (automated <b>asssembly</b> of secondary building units) focusses on the topology of network-based structures. This method explores the possible ways to assemble predefined inorganic building units in three-dimensional space, opening the way to the manipulation of very large building units (up to 84 atoms in this work). As illustrative examples we present the prediction of candidate structures for Li 4 CO 4, the identification of topological relationships within a family of metalphosphates, ULM-n and MIL-n, and finally the generation of new topologies by using predefined large building units such as a sodalite or a double-four-ring cage, for the prediction {{of new and}} interesting zeolite-type structures...|$|E
40|$|The cruise is a {{contribution}} to SEAFO resulting from a co-operation between SEAFO, the EAF-Nansen project, and the FAO Deep-sea programme. The aim is to facilitate activities {{in support of the}} efforts by RFMOs to meet objectives in relation to the United Nations General <b>Asssembly</b> (UNGA) resolution 61 / 105 and the associated FAO Guidelines on Bottom Fisheries in the high seas. Furthermore, the southeastern Atlantic ABNJ was selected by the recently initiated GEF-sponsored FAO ABNJ programme (“Common Oceans”) as an area of particular attention, involving the relevant RFMO with competent to regulate bottom fishing in that region is the Southeast Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO). Despite a shortage of data on the occurrence of ‘vulnerable marine ecosystems’ (VMEs, as defined in the FAO Guidelines), SEAFO has introduced comprehensive measures to protect such ecosystems from significant adverse impacts within the convention area. The convention area consist of agreed limited ‘existing fishing areas’, i. e. areas were fisheries were conducted within a recent reference period, and more extensive ‘new fishing areas’ where this was not the case. Commercial harvesting is essentially restricted to the ‘existing fishing areas’, but further regulated by other measures such as species-specific TACs, gear restrictions and other measures aimed to conserve e. g. sharks. To conduct exploratory fisheries in ‘new fishing areas’ parties need to submit a notification and detailed plan and report to the Organization for approval. SEAFO has furthermore closed 10 subareas of the convention area to all fishing activity, a regulation most recently revised in 2011. Best available bathymetry data were compiled to locate subareas recognised in the FAO guidelines as VME features, essentially primarily seamounts. As fishing is restricted to the upper 2000 m of any feature, a map of areas shallower than 2000 m was the basis of further selection. In SEAFO such areas are seamounts or seamount complexes of various sizes and shapes. The spatial distribution of VME indicators such as corals and sponges (i. e. as given in FAO guidelines) is not well known in SEAFO, but the benthic and pelagic biogeographical patterns have been described. It was therefore decided to close 10 potential fishing areas that represented the range of features and the major biogeographical zones of the region. Some of these were actual fishing areas; others were either not fished or lightly fished. The end result was the set of ten closures with various shapes and sizes, ranging from single seamounts to rather wider areas comprising several seamounts or mid-Atlantic Ridge segments. While SEAFO took significant steps to ensure conservation of VMEs, the shortage of information on the distribution patterns of VME indicators remains unsatisfactory. Some new data were acquired by recent fishing experiments in existing and new fishing areas, and by Spanish-Namibian research activity on the Valdivia Bank. However, even within the relatively restricted actual fishing areas, the documentation remains scattered and limited. Similarly, the Scientific Committee of SEAFO struggles with data shortage on the fish resources actually harvested in the convention area, primarily Patagonian toothfish, pelagic armourhead, alfonsino, deep-sea red crab, and associated bycatch species. Stock assessments are generally highly uncertain and fully dependant on fisheries-generated data, hence conservation measures implemented by SEAFO remain largely precautionary rather than tuned to good estimates of abundances and productivity. Catches currently remain rather limited, i. e. collectively less than 1000 t, but some species are valuable and tend to attract interest from fishing parties that would value not only enhanced opportunities but also management based on more reliable stock assessments. This project thus aims to supplement and extend knowledge and databases on VME indicators as well as fisheries resources and will accordingly conduct targeted investigations in the currently used fishing areas of the convention area, primarily on the Walvis Ridge. In addition, some of the fishing closures will be visited to document presence-absence of VME indicators and describe distribution patterns. New data from these targeted studies will enhance the quality of fish stock assessments and help analyse the appropriateness of VME closures currently implemented solely based on feature characteristics and biogeographical affinity. Main conclusions: VMEs indicators were located in all seamounts prospected but differences in structure and development state were observed. In some seamounts coral rubble, sediment-clogged, mostly dead coral framework and living coral framework were observed from the base to the summit all along the slope. Current system associated to each seamount, depth and probably other depth-dependent environmental factors driven the presence and development of deep-water reefs. Continuous research efforts are needed to increase knowledge about biodiversity and structure. Understanding their dynamics will improve effective management and conservation of this vulnerable ecosystems. FAO, EAF-Nansen project / Deep-sea Norway projec...|$|E
