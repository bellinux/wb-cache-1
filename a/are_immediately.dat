5|$|Topoisomerases {{introduce}} both single- and double-strand {{breaks in}} the course of changing the DNA's state of supercoiling, which is especially common in regions near an open replication fork. Such breaks are not considered DNA damage because they are a natural intermediate in the topoisomerase biochemical mechanism and <b>are</b> <b>immediately</b> repaired by the enzymes that created them.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, Lois {{is given}} the welfare check by the mail lady and storms at Peter for lying to her. Peter decides to return {{the money to the}} taxpayers by dumping it from a blimp during Super Bowl XXXIII while Brian accompanies him.

The dressing <b>is</b> <b>immediately</b> removed from the ear to ascertain {{the existence of a}} hematoma, which then <b>is</b> <b>immediately</b> evacuated. If the surgical wound is infected, antibiotic therapy helps avoid the occurrence either of abscess or of perichondritis (inflammation).|$|R

Ellaria states that his people have become dissatisfied with Doran's inaction against the Lannisters. As Doran dies, he pleads for his son's life, but Ellaria vows that weak men will never rule Dorne again.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that {{there exists a}} problem if a {{government}} minister simply needs to state that a national security interest {{is involved in a}} matter, upon which the rules of natural justice <b>are</b> <b>immediately</b> compromised. Thio Li-ann has commented that when important constitutional rights such as the freedom to religion are curtailed by legislation, it may be advisable for the court to impose a duty on a public authority to give reasons establishing that an order imposed by the authority is objectively valid.|$|E
5|$|Students earn demerit {{points for}} poor behaviour. Accumulated demerit points can affect final grades and {{eligibility}} for certain awards, scholarships and overseas trips. The student handbook states that, for serious offences, male students at Hwa Chong Institution may be punished with detention, suspension, caning or expulsion. Only the Principal or Discipline Master may administer corporal punishment, {{which consists of}} a maximum of five strokes of the cane. Students found smoking <b>are</b> <b>immediately</b> caned or suspended or both. Caning may also be given for integrity-related offences (e.g. cheating), uncivilized behaviour (e.g. defiance), and criminal offences (e.g. fighting).|$|E

5|$|After Cameron retires, Keating hires Roark, whom Francon soon fires {{for refusing}} to design a {{building}} in the classical style. Roark works briefly at another firm, then opens his own office but has trouble finding clients and closes it down. He gets {{a job in a}} granite quarry owned by Francon. There he meets Francon's daughter Dominique, a columnist for The New York Banner, while she is staying at her family's estate nearby. They <b>are</b> <b>immediately</b> attracted to each other, leading to a rough sexual encounter that Dominique later calls a rape. Shortly after, Roark is notified that a client is ready to start a new building, and he returns to New York. Dominique also returns to New York and learns Roark is an architect. She attacks his work in public, but visits him for secret sexual encounters.|$|E
5|$|Confronting Joyce {{about the}} story, Lois {{questions}} her intentions, with Joyce revealing {{that the two}} attended high school together, where she was known as Joyce Chevapravatdumrong. She also reveals that Lois humiliated {{her in front of}} the entire school, by placing a hotdog in her mouth and pulling down her pants while blindfolded (revealing her pink underwear), and has sought revenge ever since. At church the next day, Lois and her family enter, and <b>are</b> <b>immediately</b> demanded to leave by the preacher. Becoming extremely depressed, Lois is eventually coaxed by Brian to face her mistake by showing it to the church. The porno causes the church to reaccept her and admit the Griffin family back into their congregation due to a positive opinion of the film, much to Joyce's anger. Stewie in the meantime develops suspicions of having been conceived through the creation of the porno, heightened when he sees that one of the actors has a football-shaped head like his.|$|E
5|$|Entering {{the main}} building, the ticket office and ticket {{machines}} <b>are</b> <b>immediately</b> ahead, and the route from Temple Quay and the ferry {{is on the}} left; a bookshop is on the right, next to the platform entrance. Customer Information System screens by the entrance show arrival and departure information for all platforms, as do displays {{on each of the}} platforms. All platforms are signalled for trains in either direction and the flexible layout means that trains on any route can use any part of the station. Platforms with odd numbers are at the east end, even numbers at the west end (geographically the south, due to the curvature of the platforms).|$|E

5|$|Guitar Hero 5 allows {{players to}} start in a Band Lobby from where they can then launch {{into any of the}} game's modes, add other local and remote players to a party, and switch between the game modes without having to leave the party or lobby, a {{significant}} change in response to the difficulties players found in World Tour. The game supports a Career mode (described below), a Quickplay mode, where players can create a set list of numerous songs and play through them. All songs on disc and through downloadable content <b>are</b> <b>immediately</b> available to play in this mode. The game also carries over the competitive modes from previous Guitar Hero games.|$|E
5|$|Musical notes {{return in}} Banjo-Tooie, but are now used {{to learn new}} moves from Bottles' brother, the drill {{sergeant}} Jamjars, who assumes Bottles' role from the first game. All of Banjo and Kazooie's moves from the first game <b>are</b> <b>immediately</b> accessible in Banjo-Tooie, and the player can acquire several new moves such as first-person aiming, new egg types, {{and the ability to}} play as Banjo and Kazooie separately, with each gaining moves they can only use while on their own. Mumbo Jumbo also returns, this time as a playable character who can venture out into each world and use specific magic spells to help Banjo and Kazooie proceed. Taking over Mumbo's previous role of transforming the duo into different forms is Humba Wumba, a Native American woman who acts as Mumbo's rival.|$|E
5|$|Niko and Roman <b>are</b> <b>immediately</b> {{forced to}} flee to Bohan after their {{apartment}} and taxi company are destroyed by Dimitri's men in arson attacks. However, things go poorly as well in Bohan: Dimitri's men kidnap Roman in a failed bid to lure out Niko, who rescues Roman. Furthermore, Niko's girlfriend Michelle reveals she is a government agent and entraps Niko into working for her company, known only by its cover: United Liberty Paper. Niko kills several known or suspected terrorists for the agency {{in exchange for the}} file of the numerous crimes the police have on him and the promise of assistance in finding the traitor of his unit.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} ant {{are known to}} capture {{termites}} {{to use as a}} fresh food source later on, rather than killing them. For example, Formica nigra captures termites, and those who try to escape <b>are</b> <b>immediately</b> seized and driven underground. Certain species of ants in the subfamily Ponerinae conduct these raids although other ant species go in alone to steal the eggs or nymphs. Ants such as Megaponera analis attack the outside the mounds and Dorylinae ants attack underground. Despite this, some termites and ants can coexist peacefully. Some species of termite, including Nasutitermes corniger, form associations with certain ant species to keep away predatory ant species. The earliest known association between Azteca ants and Nasutitermes termites date back to the Oligocene to Miocene period.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese sleeper ray has {{an almost}} {{circular}} pectoral fin disc wider than long. Two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{under the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. The small, protruding eyes <b>are</b> <b>immediately</b> followed by larger spiracles with prominently raised, smooth rims. The nostrils are small and placed close together, and between them is a curtain of skin that overlaps the mouth. The protrusible mouth forms a short, transverse line and is surrounded by a deep groove. There are fewer than 25 tooth rows in each jaw, arranged into bands; the teeth are small with oval bases and pointed crowns. Five pairs of short gill slits are located on the underside of the disc.|$|E
5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores <b>are</b> <b>immediately</b> displayed to the audience.|$|E

5|$|The {{guinea pig}} {{is able to}} breed year-round, with birth peaks usually coming in the spring; {{as many as five}} litters can be {{produced}} per year. The gestation period lasts from 59–72 days, with an average of 63–68 days. Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and eggplant-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies. Unlike the offspring of most other rodents, which are altricial at birth, newborn pups are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws, and partial eyesight; they <b>are</b> <b>immediately</b> mobile, and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to suckle. Litters yield one to six pups, with an average of three; the largest recorded litter size is 17. The guinea pig mother only has two nipples, but she can readily raise the more average-sized litters of 2 to 4 piglets.|$|E
5|$|The on-disc soundtrack {{contains}} 93 mixes, each featuring {{one or two}} songs. These {{are arranged}} across 24 setlists, ordered roughly by difficulty of the mix, with more difficult mixes appearing later in the game. To access later tiers, the player must earn a pre-set number of stars on previous mixes at any difficulty. All mixes <b>are</b> <b>immediately</b> available {{to play in the}} Quickplay and competitive modes. The table below lists the mixes in the game, including the two songs that contribute to their mix as well as their individual artists; the mix artist that created the mix; whether the song is playable in the game's DJ vs Guitar mode; and the career tier in which the song is located.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the bluespotted ribbontail ray is oval in shape, around four-fifths {{as wide as}} long, with a rounded to broadly angular snout. The large, protruding eyes <b>are</b> <b>immediately</b> followed by the broad spiracles. There is a narrow flap of skin between the nares with a fringed posterior margin, reaching past the mouth. The lower jaw dips at the middle and deep furrows are present at the mouth corners. There are 15–24 tooth rows in either jaw, arranged into pavement-like plates, and two large papillae {{on the floor of}} the mouth. The pelvic fins are narrow and angular. The thick, depressed tail measures about 1.5 times the disc length and bears one or two (usually two) serrated spines well behind the tail base; there is a deep fin fold on the ventral surface, reaching the tip of the tail, and a low midline ridge on the upper surface.|$|E
