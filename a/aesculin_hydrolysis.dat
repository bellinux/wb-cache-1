40|$|A {{collection}} of 308 clinical isolates of beta-haemolytic Lancefield group C streptococci was assembled from laboratories in England, Nigeria and New Zealand. Of these, 276 isolates were Streptococcus equisimilis, 23 S. milleri and nine S. zooepidemicus. Isolates of S. equisimilis in the African collection, though few, gave {{higher rates of}} lactose and raffinose fermentation, <b>aesculin</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> and positive alpha-galactosidase reactions than those from elsewhere. Erythromycin resistance was found in 1. 9 % of the English isolates of S. equisimilis. Strains from superficial infections accounted for 88 % of the collection and were most commonly isolated from the upper respiratory tract, skin or wounds. Amongst the 36 patients yielding isolates from deep sites S. equisimilis was found in septicaemia, cellulitis, abscess, peritonitis, septic arthritis, pneumonia, mycotic aneurysm and acute epiglottitis, S. milleri was found in abdominal abscesses, peritonitis, pleural empyema and osteomyelitis and S. zooepidemicus was found in septicaemia, pneumonia, meningitis and septic arthritis. Within the collection an unselected general catchment of 214 isolates of group C streptococci from the laboratories in Yorkshire showed the following species: from 199 superficial infections 94 % S. equisimilis, 5 % S. milleri and 1 % S. zooepidemicus and 15 patients with deeper, more aggressive infections 67, 27 and 6. 7 % of these species respectively...|$|E

The isolate was a Gram-negative rod that {{was able to}} grow at 15 – 36 6 C and pH 5. 5 – 8. 0. Strain DC- 186 T was positive in tests for catalase, oxidase and b-galactosidase activities and <b>aesculin</b> <b>hydrolysis.</b> The predominant fatty acids were the summed feature C 16 : 1 /iso-C 15 : 0 2 -OH (42 %) and iso-C 15 : 0 (26 %), the major respiratory quinone was menaquinone- 7 and the genomic DNA G+C content was 42 mol%. 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis and phenetic characterization indicated that this organism belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and revealed its affiliation to the family Sphingobacteriaceae. Of recognized taxa, strain DC- 186 T was most closely related to Sphingobacterium daejeonense (90 % sequence similarity) based on 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The low 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity with other recognized taxa and the identification of distinctive phenetic features for this isolate support {{the definition of a}} new genus within the family Sphingobacteriaceae.

30|$|Regarding Proteus genus, P. hauseri {{belonged to}} the family of Enterobacteriaceae, is a gram-negative Proteobacterium, but not well {{characterized}} like P. mirabilis. Recent findings indicated that P. hauseri was capable of promising bioelectricity generation and textile dye decolorization for redox-mediating applications (Chen et al. 2010). The genus of Proteus was first classified by Professor Hauser in 1885 to characterize this kind of dimorphic strains. As indicated, exploration of Proteus genus has been implemented for more than one century. Up to now, Proteus genus at least contains five species of P. vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. penneri, P. hauseri, and P. myxofaciens (Pearson et al. 2008, 2011; Poore and Mobley 2003). Regarding classification, Brenner-introduced P. vulgaris was a heterogeneous group with at least three biogroups via DHA-hybridizations. The biogroup 1 was separated from P. vulgaris and the nomenclature of P. penneri was distinguished by negative reactions for indole production, salicin fermentation, and <b>aesculin</b> <b>hydrolysis.</b> Biogroup 2 was positive for reporter reaction of salicin and aesculin, while biogroup 3 was negative for salicin and aesculin, respectively. According to O’Hara, biogroup 3 could be composed of four distinct DNA groups, further assigned as biogroups 3, 4, 5, and 6. The new biogroup 3 was identified as P. hauseri due to l-rhamnose fermentation, DNase, lipase production, and Jordan’s tartrate utilization (O’Hara et al. 2000). Regard to the other biogroups, they are still remained open to be further classified via characterization of other biofunctions.|$|E
40|$|A {{bacterial}} strain named BSTT 44 T was {{isolated in the}} course of a study of endophytic bacteria occurring in stems and roots of potato growing in a soil from Salamanca, Spain. The 16 S rRNA gene sequence had 99. 7 % identity with respect to that of its closest relative, Pseudomonas psychrophila E- 3 T, and the next most closely related type strains were those of Pseudomonas fragi, with 99. 6 % similarity, Pseudomonas deceptionensis, with 99. 2 % similarity, and Pseudomonas lundensis, with 99. 0 % similarity; these results indicate that BSTT 44 T should be classified within the genus Pseudomonas. Analysis of the housekeeping genes rpoB, rpoD and gyrB confirmed its phylogenetic affiliation and showed identities lower than 92 % in all cases with respect to the above-mentioned closest relatives. Cells of the strain bore one polar–subpolar flagellum. The respiratory quinone was Q- 9.

40|$|Infection {{caused by}} Nocardia spp. Is unusual and {{presents}} {{with a variety}} of clinical manifestations in both immunocompromised patients and in immunocompetent hosts. The diagnosis of Nocardia is often difficult, and further hampered by the absence of specific clinical symptoms. A man, 63 years old, caring for about a month from multiple erosions of the oral cavity and Inca intergluteale associated with blisters and erosions scattered in the face, scalp and trunk. The routine laboratory tests, including serological testing for HIV and the determination of circulating CD 4 lymphocytes, were negative. The chest X-ray was also negative. Due to the diagnostic suspicion of Pemphigus vulgaris (PV), therapy with methylprednisolone and azathioprine was initiated. After 15 days the patient’s condition worsened and it became necessary hospitalization in intensive care. A CT scan found: pleural empyema, abscess, and paravertebral muscle abscess. The cultural examination of pleural fluid and synovial fluid gave positive results for Nocardia asteroides. On this basis, sulphamethoxazole was administered in association with trimethoprim for 2 months, with a complete remission of the symptoms. At a median follow up of 2 years the patient’s general condition was excellent, without residual signs of infection. The cultured samples from pleural and synovial fluids gave a clear positivity after 5 days of incubation at 37 ° C on blood agar and chocolate agar plates; the colonies showed chalky and thin filaments, slide as branched Gram-positives and appeared partially acid-alcohol resistant by modified Kinyoun staining (1 % H 2 SO 4). The presumptive identification of Nocardia spp. was additionally confirmed by biochemical tests for the identification of species with the following results: catalase test positive, oxidase test negative, <b>aesculin</b> <b>hydrolysis,</b> reduction of nitrite to nitrate and urease test positive. Given the low incidence of Nocardia spp. infection, and the non-typical clinical manifestations, microbiological diagnosis of this infection is critical for the selection of an appropriate antibiotic therapy that should be prolonged for several months...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} by phenotypic and molecular tools the antibiotic resistance profile and the virulence markers of 100 environmental Escherichia coli strains isolated from marine water in Constanta, Romania. The antibiosusceptibility testings were performed by disk diffusion method (CLSI, 201, including the phenotypic screening of beta-lactamases. The presence of different antibiotic resistance markers was correlated with the plasmidial pattern of the analyzed strains. Eleven (11) virulence factors were tested by using specific culture media. PCR was performed for the following antibiotic resistance and virulence genes: sul 1, 2, 3, aggR, EAST- 1, AAFI/II. The tested strains exhibited high susceptibility to imipenem, ceftriaxone, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin (99 %), tobramycin (98 %), cephtazidime (97 %), gentamycin and amikacin (96 %), ciprofloxacin (93 %), nalidixic acid and chloramphenicole (92 %) sulphametoxazole (89 %) and high resistance levels to ampicillin (94 %). The tested strains exhibited between 1 and 8 antibioresistance markers, the most frequent associations being: MP+SXT (10 %), AMP+C (9 %), AMP+CIP (8 %) and AMP+NA (7 %). Morevoer, the tested strains exhibited tolerance to heavy metals, i. e. to Zn (72 %), Mn (98 %), Cu (98 %), Co (95 %), and Ni (99 %). 43, 6 % strains exhibiting resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics proved to be positive for the presence of beta-lactamases when tested by nitrocephine rapid test.

The colony-forming unit (CFU) from fifth time serial dilution (10 − 5) {{was selected for}} colony counting. Gram staining also was done to identify Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Catalase test was done to identify Gram-positive bacilli. API kit (Biomerieux) API 20 E and API 20 NE were used to identify Gram-negative bacteria. Incubation box, tray and lid were prepared for the strip preparation. For the inoculum preparation, an ampule of API NaCl 0.85  % (2  ml) was selected and 1 – 4 colonies of bacteria were picked up using inoculation loop from the agar plate and then suspension was prepared with the turbidity equivalent to 0.5 McFarland. For the API 20 NE strip inoculation, test nitrate reduction (NO 3) and p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside hydrolysis (PNPG) were inoculated by distributing the saline suspension into the tubes using Pasteur pipette. API AUX medium was added to approximately 200  µl of the remaining suspension into the ampule and was homogenized well. Tubes and cupules of test glucose fermentation (GLU) and Phenyl-acetate assimilation test (PAC) were filled with the suspension. Mineral oil {{was added to the}} cupules of 3 tests (GLU), arginine hydrolysis (ADH), and urea hydrolysis (URE) until convex meniscuses formed. The incubation box was closed and incubated at 29  ±  2  °C for 24  h. After the incubation period, the strips were read by referring to the reading table. The reactions for (GLU, ADH, URE, <b>aesculin</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> test (ESC)), gelatine hydrolysis (GEL) and (PNPG) were recorded on result sheet. For NO 3 test, 1 drop of NIT 1 and 1 drop of NIT 2 reagents were added to NO 3 cupule. For tryptophan deaminase test (TRP), 1 drop of JAMES reagent was added and immediate reaction took place. NIT 1, NIT 2 and JAMES reagents were removed using pipette and test NO 3 and TRP were covered with mineral oil. Kit was reincubated at 29  ±  2  °C for 24  h and all tests were read again except for NO 3, TRP and underlined GLU, which were only read once at 24  h. Identification is obtained with the numerical profile.
