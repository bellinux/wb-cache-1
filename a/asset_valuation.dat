This last point was important because without it all disputes would have to be passed back either to the Local Government Board or the House of Commons.

We address this question by examining how survey data on investor sentiment relates to i) long-horizon returns, and ii) <b>asset</b> <b>valuations.</b> If excessive optimism drives prices above intrinsic values, periods of high sentiment should be followed by low returns as market prices revert to fundamental values. We find this to be the case for the overall stock market at horizons of two to three years. The relation is strongest for large-capitalization, low book-to-market (growth) portfolios. We also examine the relation between sentiment levels and deviations from intrinsic value. Using errors from an independent pricing model, we find sentiment is positively related to valuation errors using a variety of tests. All of our results are robust to the inclusion of other factors that have been shown to forecast stock returns, including past returns...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} whether fund valuations {{produced by}} private equity managers are biased predictors of future discounted cash flows (DCF). Our research {{is based on}} an extensive set of timed cash flows and reported net asset values (NAVs) that relates to 483 funds spanning 1988 - 2011.

This result is particularly interesting to investors for whom unbiased <b>asset</b> <b>valuations</b> are important in keeping portfolios optimally allocated. In addition, findings indicate that although NAVs generally are more conservative in the first half of our sample period, NAVs for venture capital funds tend to overstate economic value after 1999 following the bursting of the tech bubble. We also find some evidence that private equity managers of funds that perform less well use their discretion over <b>asset</b> <b>valuations</b> to keep <b>asset</b> values high during fundraising periods, as well as at the end of the fund life, which can result in higher management fees...|$|R

In years after the acquisition, operating earnings will be reduced as increased <b>asset</b> <b>valuations</b> are amortized or depreciated. Disclosure requirements contained in the revised standard provide financial statement readers with new insights into why firms are able to effect acquisitions at less than fair value. In reviewing 71 acquisitions, we find several reasons {{for the existence of}} such bargain purchase gains, ranging from financial distress of the target, to special characteristics of the acquiring firm, to flaws in the bidding process. These findings have implications for investors, who must analyze bargain purchase transactions, for CFOs and other corporate managers, who must implement the new standardâ€™s provisions, and for regulators, who must determine whether the new standard is being properly applied...|$|R
