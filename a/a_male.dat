40|$|Both intra- and inter-sexual {{selection}} may crucially determine <b>a</b> <b>male's</b> fitness. Their interplay, {{which has}} rarely been experimentally investigated, determines <b>a</b> <b>male's</b> optimal reproductive strategy and thus is of fundamental importance {{to the understanding of}} <b>a</b> <b>male's</b> behaviour. Here we investigated the relative importance of intra- and inter-sexual selection for male fitness in the common lizard. We investigated which <b>male</b> traits predict <b>a</b> <b>male's</b> access to reproduction allowing for both selective pressures and comparing it with a staged mating experiment excluding all types of intra-sexual selection. We found that qualitatively better males were more likely to reproduce and that sexual selection was two times stronger when allowing for both selective pressures, suggesting that inter- and intra-sexual selection determines male fitness and confirming the existence of multi-factorial sexual selection. Consequently, to optimize fitness, males should trade their investment between the traits, which are important for inter- and intra-sexual selection...|$|R

5|$|A female P. labiata {{that sees}} <b>a</b> <b>male</b> may {{approach}} slowly or wait. The male then walks with erect and displaying by waving {{his legs and}} palps. If the female does not run away, she gives a propulsive display first. If the male stands his ground and she does not ran away or repeat the propulsive display, he approaches and, if she is mature, they copulate. If the female is sub-adult (one moult from maturity), <b>a</b> <b>male</b> may cohabit in the female's capture web. Portias usually mate on a web or on a dragline made by the female. P. labiata typically copulates for about 100seconds, while other genera can take several minutes or even several hours.|$|E
5|$|After mating, {{the female}} washes her vulva thoroughly. If <b>a</b> <b>male</b> {{attempts}} {{to mate with}} her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.|$|E

40|$|Hamilton and Zuk’s {{influential}} {{hypothesis of}} parasite-mediated sexual selection proposes that exaggerated secondary sexual ornaments indicate <b>a</b> <b>male’s</b> additive genetic immunity to parasites. However, genetic correlates of ornamentation and immunity have rarely been explicitly identified. Evidence supporting Hamilton and Zuk’s hypothesis has instead been gathered {{by looking for}} positive phenotypic correlations between ornamentation and immunity; such correlations are assumed to reflect causal, additive relationships between these traits. We show that in song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, <b>a</b> <b>male’s</b> song repertoire size, a secondary sexual trait, increased with his cell-mediated immune response (CMI) to an experimental challenge. However, this phenotypic correlation could be explained because both repertoire size and CMI declined with <b>a</b> <b>male’s</b> inbreeding level. Repertoire size therefore primarily indicated <b>a</b> <b>male’s</b> relative heterozygosity, <b>a</b> non-additive genetic predictor of immunity. Caution may therefore be required when interpreting phenotypic correlations as support for Hamilton and Zuk’s additive model of sexual selection. However, our results suggest that female song sparrows choosing males with large repertoires would on average acquire more outbred and therefore more heterozygous mates. Such genetic dominance effects on ornamentation are likely to influence evolutionary trajectories of female choice, and should be explicitly incorporated into genetic models of sexual selection...|$|R
40|$|Free-ranging {{adult male}} baboons give loud two-syllable ‘wahoo’ calls during dawn choruses, {{interactions}} between groups, when chasing females, and in aggressive interactions with other males. Previous {{research has shown}} that the rate and duration of these contest wahoos are correlated with <b>a</b> <b>male’s</b> competitive ability: high-ranking males call more often, call at faster rates, and call for longer bouts than do low-ranking males. Here we report that acoustic features of wahoos also reveal information about male competitive ability. High-ranking males give wahoos with higher fundamental frequencies (F 0) and longer ‘hoo’ syllables. Within-subject analyses revealed that, as males fall in rank, the hoo syllables tend to shorten within a period of months. <b>As</b> <b>males</b> age and continue to fall in rank, F 0 declines, hoo syllables shorten, and formant dispersion decreases. Independent of age and rank, within bouts of calling F 0 declines and hoo syllables become shorter. Because wahoos are often given while males are running or leaping through trees, variation in these acoustic features may function as an indicator of <b>a</b> <b>male’s</b> stamina. The acoustic features of contest wahoos thus potentially allow listeners to assess <b>a</b> <b>male’s</b> competitive ability...|$|R
