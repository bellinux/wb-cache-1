The final ship of the British line, Culloden under Troubridge, sailed too close to Aboukir Island in the growing darkness and became stuck fast on the shoal.

25|$|Surfing is {{a surface}} water sport {{in which the}} wave rider, {{referred}} to as a surfer, rides on the forward or deep face of a moving wave, which is usually carrying the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or in rivers {{in the form of a}} standing wave or tidal bore. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> created in artificial wave pools.|$|E
25|$|The {{assumption}} that the free field is identically zero {{is the core of}} the absorber idea. It means that the radiation emitted by each particle is completely absorbed by all other particles present in the universe. To better understand this point, it may be useful to consider how the absorption mechanism works in common materials. At the microscopic scale, it results from the sum of the incoming electromagnetic wave <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> generated from the electrons of the material, which react to the external perturbation. If the incoming wave is absorbed, the result is a zero outgoing field. In the absorber theory the same concept is used, however, in presence of both retarded and advanced waves.|$|E
25|$|Cnut the Great (Old Norse: Knútr inn ríki; c. 995 – 12 November 1035), {{also known}} as Canut—whose father was Sweyn Forkbeard (which gave him the patronym Sweynsson, Old Norse: Sveinsson)—was King of Denmark, England and Norway; {{together}} {{often referred to as}} the North Sea Empire. With the deaths of his heirs within a decade of his own, and Norman conquest of England in 1066, this legacy was mostly forgotten. He is popularly invoked in the context of the legend of King Canute <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>waves,</b> which usually misrepresents him as a deluded monarch believing he has supernatural powers, contrary to the original legend which portrays a wise king who rebuked his courtiers for their fawning behaviour.|$|E

25|$|By {{combining}} the two concepts, {{both of these}} problems could be eliminated. Since phase comparison is generally more accurate at low frequencies, taking accurate fixes {{would be based on}} this technique. But instead of broadcasting a continuous signal, {{as in the case of}} Decca, the signal would be in the form of pulses. These would be used to make a rough fix using the same technique as Gee or LORAN, positively identifying the lane, and then a phase comparison would be used to take a more accurate measurement. The only problem from a development standpoint would be selecting frequencies that allowed reasonably accurate pulse envelopes while still having measurable waveforms within the pulses, as well as developing displays capable of showing both the pulses as a whole, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> within them.|$|E

He held this record until 2016 when Jamala from Ukraine won with a record 534 points (but {{because of the new}} scoring system with separate sets of televotes and jury votes, the results are not comparable with each other). His average score of 9.4 points from every voting nation was the highest since the wide use of televoting began in 1998. Rybak received sixteen scores of 12 points, also a new record, surpassing the previous record of ten held by Katrina <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Waves</b> (1997) and Helena Paparizou (2005); this record was surpassed in 2012, by Loreen, who received eighteen.|$|E
25|$|The first {{classification}} {{is a type}} 1 jetty. This type of jetty {{is significantly}} longer than the surf zone width <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> break at the shore end of the jetty. The effect of a Type 1 jetty is sediment accumulation in a wedge formation on the jetty. These waves are large and increase in size as they pass over the sediment wedge formation. An example of a Type 1 jetty is Mission Beach, San Diego, California. This 1000-meter jetty was installed in 1950 {{at the mouth of}} Mission Bay. The surf waves happen north of the jetty, are longer waves, and are powerful. The bathymetry of the sea bottom in Mission Bay has a wedge shape formation that causes the waves to refract as they become closer to the jetty. The waves converge constructively after they refract and increase the sizes of the waves.|$|E

25|$|The first rescue {{attempts}} were made {{on the following day}} when two tugboats tried to turn the stern of Sampo towards open water together with the icebreaker's own engine and rudder. However, the task was deemed impossible and the tugboats evacuated the pilot and the women working in the icebreaker's kitchen to Mäntyluoto. On 8 January Sampo was further damaged when the wind pushed a large ice floe {{against the side of the}} icebreaker <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> began pounding her hull against the rocks. Both engine rooms flooded and the pumps stopped. In the following night Sampo slowly settled in the bottom, listing the partially submerged icebreaker approximately 20 degrees starboard. The remaining crew members were evacuated in heavy weather and freezing temperatures on the following day. The salvaging Sampo was awarded to the Finnish salvage company Neptun Oy, but the task was deemed impossible in the presence of ice.|$|E
