40|$|Abstract Background One of the {{greatest}} challenges facing the early land vertebrates was the need to effectively interpret a terrestrial environment. Interpretation was based on ocular adaptations evolved for an aquatic environment millions of years earlier. The <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish</b> Neoceratodus forsteri is thought to be the closest living relative to the first terrestrial vertebrate, and yet nothing is known about the visual pigments present in lungfish or the early tetrapods. Results Here we identify and characterise five visual pigments (rh 1, rh 2, lws, sws 1 and s ws 2) expressed in the retina of N. forsteri. Phylogenetic analysis of the molecular evolution of lungfish and other vertebrate visual pigment genes indicates a closer relationship between lungfish and amphibian pigments than to pigments in teleost fishes. However, the relationship between lungfish, the coelacanth and tetrapods could not be absolutely determined from opsin phylogeny, supporting an unresolved trichotomy between the three groups. Conclusion The presence of four cone pigments in <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish</b> suggests that the earliest tetrapods would have had a colorful view of their terrestrial environment. </p...|$|R
40|$|Autoradiographic {{analysis}} of the primary retinofugal projections in the <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish</b> reveals contralateral retinal projections to a ventral portion of the periventricular preoptic nucleus, throughout its rostrocaudal extent, and to 4 distinct terminal fields in the thalamus. Only one of these thalamic fields (t 4) likely receives dendrites soley from dorsal thalamic neurons. Thalamic terminal field 1 probably receives dendrites from both dorsal and ventral thalamic neurons, and fields 2 and 3 from only ventral thalamic neurons. Contralateral retinofugal fibers terminate in the pretectum and in the superficial and central tectal zones. The central tectal terminal field is restricted to the medial one-third of the tectum. At pretectal levels a contralateral basal optic tract arises from the marginal optic tract and terminates along the lateral edge of the tegmentum, {{as a series of}} glomerular puffs, and in the rostral pole of a superficial isthmal nucleus. The <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish,</b> unlike the African and South American lungfish, possesses ipsilateral retinal projections to all of the nuclei that receive contralateral retinal input...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the brains}} of the three extant {{lungfish}} genera have been previously described, the spatial relationship between the brain and the neurocranium has never before been fully described nor quantified. Through the application of virtual microtomography (μCT) and 3 D rendering software, we describe aspects of the gross anatomy {{of the brain and}} labyrinth region in the <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish,</b> Neoceratodus forsteri and compare this to previous accounts. Unexpected characters in this specimen include short olfactory peduncles connecting the olfactory bulbs to the telencephalon, and an oblong telencephalon. Furthermore, we illustrate the endocast (the mould of the internal space of the neurocranial cavity) of Neoceratodus, also describing and quantifying the brain-endocast relationship in a lungfish for the first time. Overall, the brain of the <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish</b> closely matches {{the size and shape of}} the endocast cavity housing it, filling more than four fifths of the total volume. The forebrain and labyrinth regions of the brain correspond very well to the endocast morphology, while the midbrain and hindbrain do not fit so closely.

40|$|The {{visual system}} of the <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish</b> N. forsteri has {{more in common with}} {{terrestrial}} vertebrates such as reptiles and birds, than with both sharks and bony fish. Features such as coloured oil droplets and multiple visual pigments indicate their phylogenetic allegiance with tetrapods, and suggest that the terrestrial trend for colour vision on land, with narrowly tuned spectral sensitivities, started in water. New aspects of the visual system and visual environment of N. forsteri are presented enabling a visual ecology for this species to be described for the first time. Using microspectrophotometry and spectrophotometry we describe: five visual pigment types (four cones with maximum sensitivities at 620 nm, 557 nm, 479 nm, and 374 nm, and a rod at 543 nm), the absorbance of two oil droplets (red and clear) and an ellipsoidal inclusion (yellow), ocular media absorbance (cornea and lens), spectral sensitivities which result from these observa- tions, the light environment in rivers inhabited by N. forsteri, the colours of the fish, and the colours of some of their immediate surroundings.

40|$|Haploid genomes {{greater than}} 25, 000 Mb are rare, within the animals only the {{lungfish}} {{and some of}} the salamanders and crustaceans are known to have genomes this large. There is very little data on the structure of genomes this size. It is known, however, that for animal genomes up to 3, 000 Mb, there is in general a good correlation between genome size and the percent of the genome composed of repetitive sequence and that this repetitive component is highly dynamic. In this study, we sampled the <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish</b> genome using three mini-genomic libraries and found that with very little sequence, the results converged on an estimate of 40 of the genome being composed of recognizable transposable elements (TEs), chiefly from the CR 1 and L 2 long interspersed nuclear element clades. We further characterized the CR 1 and L 2 elements in the lungfish genome and show that although most CR 1 elements probably represent recent amplifications, the L 2 elements are more diverse and are more likely the result of a series of amplifications. We suggest that our sampling method has probably underestimated the recognizable TE content. However, {{on the basis of the}} most likely sources of error, we suggest that this very large genome is not largely composed of recently amplified, undetected TEs but may instead include a large component of older degenerate TEs. Based on these estimates, and on Thomson's (Thomson K. 1972. An attempt to reconstruct evolutionary changes in the cellular DNA content of lungfish. J Exp Zool. 180 : 363 - 372) inference that in the lineage leading to the extant <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish,</b> there was massive increase in genome size between 350 and 200 mya, after which the size of the genome changed little, we speculate that the very large <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish</b> genome may be the result of a massive amplification of TEs followed by a long period with a very low rate of sequence removal and some ongoing TE activity. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} {{temporal}} order of tooth addition in the <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish</b> where timing of tooth induction is sequential {{in the same}} pattern as osteichthyans along the lower jaw. The order of tooth initiation in Neoceratodus starts from the midline tooth, together with left and right ones at jaw position 2, followed by 3 and then 1. This is the pattern order for dentary teeth of several teleosts and what we propose represents a stereotypic initiation pattern shared with all osteichthyans, including the living sister group to all tetrapods, the <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish.</b> This is contrary to previous opinions that the lungfish dentition is otherwise derived and uniquely different. Sonic hedgehog (shh) expression is intensely focused on tooth positions at different times corresponding with their initiation order. This deployment of shh is required for lungfish tooth induction, as cyclopamine treatment results in complete loss of these teeth when applied before they develop. The temporal sequence of tooth initiation is possibly regulated by shh and is know to be required for dentition pattern in other osteichthyans, including cichlid fish and snakes. This reflects a shared developmental process with jawed vertebrates {{at the level of}} the tooth module but differs with the lack of replacement teeth. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish,</b> Neoceratodus forsteri, is {{the only}} {{vertebrate}} that possesses a complete spiral valve intestine with pre-pyloric coiling. This study describes the anatomy and histology of the spiral valve intestine in juvenile N. forsteri and compares it to a previous study of adult N. forsteri, thus providing a broader picture and {{better understanding of the}} intestine of the <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish.</b> Not surprisingly, most features of the spiral valve intestine in juvenile and adult N. forsteri are similar. However, our study goes further to show that, unlike most other vertebrates, the stomach (pre-pyloris) is non-distensible (lacks rugae). Rugae are confined to the post-pyloric duodenum. The epithelium of the pyloric fold, between foregut and midgut, is ciliated and the presence of lymphoid tissue in the pyloric fold implies the involvement of this region in the immune system. Lymphoid tissue is also present around the posterior spleen in the medial axis, which indicates a broader gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in juvenile Neoceratodus than has been previously recognized in adult Neoceratodus. This study also found some node-like structures in the epithelium of the mucosal tissue, which resemble the Peyer’s patches of other more advanced vertebrates. Furthermore, a previously unreported parasite was found in the spleen encased in fibrous tissue, indicating an immune response had been mounted by the host against it. These latter observations suggest that a thorough investigation of GALT in Neoceratodus is warranted. 24 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{well-established}} role of neurohypophysial hormones in osmoregulation {{of terrestrial}} vertebrates, lungfishes are a key group for study of the molecular and functional evolution of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system. Here {{we report on the}} primary structure of the precursors encoding vasotocin (VT) and [Phe 2]mesotocin ([Phe 2]MT) of the <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish,</b> Neoceratodus forsteri. Genomic sequence analysis and Northern blot analysis confirmed that [Phe 2]MT is a native oxytocin family peptide in the <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish,</b> although {{it has been reported that}} the lungfish neurohypophysis contains MT. The VT precursor consists of a signal peptide, VT, that is connected to a neurophysin by a Gly-Lys-Arg sequence, and a copeptin moiety that includes a Leu-rich core segment and a glycosylation site. In contrast, the [Phe 2]MT precursor does not contain a copeptin moiety. These structural features of the lungfish precursors are consistent with those in tetrapods, but different from those in teleosts where both VT and isotocin precursors contain a copeptin-like moiety without a glycosylation site at the carboxyl terminals of their neurophysins. Comparison of the exon/intron organization also supports homology of the lungfish [Phe 2]MT gene with tetrapod oxytocin/MT genes, rather than with teleost isotocin genes. Moreover, molecular phylogenetic analysis shows that neurohypophysial hormone genes of the lungfish are closely related to those of the toad. The present results along with previous morphological findings indicate that the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system of the lungfish has evolved along the tetrapod lineage, whereas the teleosts form a separate lineage, both within the class Osteichthyes...|$|R
40|$|The {{timing and}} pattern of cranial neural crest cell {{emergence}} and migration in the Mexican axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum, are assessed using {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). Cranial neural crest cells emerge and begin to migrate {{at the time of}} neural fold closure and soon form three distinct streams. The most anterior (mandibular) stream emerges first, {{at the level of the}} mesencephalon. Cells in this stream migrate rostroventrally around the optic vesicle. The second (hyoid) and third (branchial) streams emerge in close succession at the level of the rhombencephalon and extend ventrolaterally. Cells forming the hyoid stream migrate rostral to the otic vesicle, whereas the branchial stream divides into two parallel streams, which migrate caudal to the otic vesicle. At later stages (stage 26 onwards) the cranial neural crest cells disperse into the adjacent mesoderm and can no longer be followed by dissection and SEM. The pattern of cranial neural crest emergence and migration, and division into migratory streams is similar to that in other amphibians and in the <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish</b> (Neoceratodus forsteri). Emergence of crest cells from the neural tube, relative to the time of neural tube closure, occurs relatively late in comparison to anurans, but much earlier than in the <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish.</b> These results establish a morphological foundation for studies in progress on the further development and fate of cranial neural crest cells in the Mexican axolotl, as well as for studies of the role of cranial neural crest in cranial patterning.

40|$|Background: The fish-tetrapod {{transition}} {{was one of}} {{the major}} events in vertebrate evolution and was enabled by many morphological changes. Although the transformation of paired fish fins into tetrapod limbs has been a major topic of study in recent years, both from paleontological and comparative developmental perspectives, the interest has focused almost exclusively on the distal part of the appendage and in particular the origin of digits. Relatively little {{attention has been paid to}} the transformation of the pelvic girdle from a small unipartite structure to a large tripartite weight-bearing structure, allowing tetrapods to rely mostly on their hindlimbs for locomotion. In order to understand how the ischium and the ilium evolved and how the acetabulum was reoriented during this transition, growth series of the <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish</b> Neoceratodus forsteri and the Mexican axolotl Ambystoma mexicanum were cleared and stained for cartilage and bone and immunostained for skeletal muscles. In order to understand the myological developmental data, hypotheses about the homologies of pelvic muscles in adults of Latimeria, Neoceratodus and Necturus were formulated based on descriptions from the literature of the coelacanth (Latimeria), the <b>Australian</b> <b>Lungfish</b> (Neoceratodus) and a salamander (Necturus). Results: In the axolotl and the lungfish, the chondrification of the pelvic girdle starts at the acetabula and progresses anteriorly in the lungfish and anteriorly and posteriorly in the salamander. The ilium develops by extending dorsally to meet and connect to the sacral rib in the axolotl. Homologous muscles develop in the same order with the hypaxial musculature developing first, followed by the deep, then the superficial pelvic musculature. Conclusions: Development of the pelvic endoskeleton and musculature is very similar in Neoceratodus and Ambystoma. If the acetabulum is seen as being a fixed landmark, the evolution of the ischium only required pubic pre-chondrogenic cells to migrate posteriorly. It is hypothesized that the iliac process or ridge present in most tetrapodomorph fish is the precursor to the tetrapod ilium and that its evolution mimicked its development in modern salamanders. 19 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We {{determined}} the complete nucleotide sequences (16403 and 16572 base pairs, respectively) of the mitochondrial genomes of the South American lungfish, Lepidosiren paradoxa, and the <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish,</b> Neoceratodus forsten (Sarcopterygii, Dipnoi). The mitochondrial DNA sequences {{were established in}} an effort to resolve the debated evolutionary positions of the lungfish and the coelacanth relative to land vertebrates. Previous molecular phylogenetic studies based on complete mtDNA sequences, including only the African lungfish, Protopterus dolloi, sequence were able to strongly reject the traditional textbook hypothesis that coelacanths are the closest relatives of land vertebrates. However, these studies were unable to statistically significantly distinguish between the two remaining scenarios: lungfish as the closest relatives to land vertebrates and lungfish and coelacanths jointly as their sister group (Cao et al. 1998; Zardoya et al. 1998; Zardoya and Meyer 1997 a). Lungfish, coelacanths, and the fish ancestors of the tetrapod lineage all originated within a short time window of about 20 million years, back in the early Devonian (about 380 to 400 million years ago). This short divergence time makes the determination of the phylogenetic relationships among these three lineages difficult. In this study, we attempted to break the long evolutionary branch of lungfish, {{in an effort to}} better resolve the phylogenetic relationships among the three extant sarcopterygian lineages. The gene order of the mitochondrial genomes of the South American and <b>Australian</b> <b>lungfish</b> conforms to the consensus gene order among gnathostome vertebrates. The phylogenetic analyses of the complete set of mitochondrial proteins (without ND 6) suggest that the lungfish are the closest relatives of the tetrapods, although the support in favor of this scenario is not statistically significant. The two other smaller data sets (tRNA and rRNA genes) give inconsistent results depending on the different reconstruction methods applied and cannot significantly rule out any of the three alternative hypotheses. Nuclear protein-coding genes, which might be better phylogenetic markers for this question, support the lungfish-tetrapod sister-group relationship (Brinkmann et al. 2004). 15 page(s...|$|R
