40|$|Introduction In {{the last}} two decades, {{wireless}} communication systems such as cordless phones, paging systems, wireless data networks, satellite-based and cellular mobile systems have been steadily increasing in both popular importance and technological sophistication. The first-generation wireless systems were developed in the late 1970 's and 1980 's and were based on analog technology (such as the <b>Advance</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Phone</b> <b>Service</b> (AMPS) by AT&T and Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) by Ericsson). As demand increased and digital technology matured in the 1980 's and 1990 's the second-generation digital wireless systems were designed (such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) in Europe and Digital AMPS in North America). These systems, currently in use, offer higher system capacity and improved quality of service. Third-generation systems, referred to as personal communication systems (PCS), are currently under development and expected to be deployed {{at the beginning of}} the 21...|$|R

The worst-case condition is {{considered for the}} downlink analysis. Moreover, the effect of sidelobes outside the FDSS principal spectrum is considered. The downlink and uplink capacity of both systems are given using a model of 25 cells. Results show that the uplink is the link that limits {{the capacity of the}} mixed system and that it is affected highly by the increment of the AMPS transmitted signal. An original AMPS system with 24 channels per cell can be substituted by a mixed system, which has an AMPS system capacity of 12 channels per cell and an FDSS system capacity of 181 users per cell...|$|E

This thesis describes the AMPS system and explains how service is provided to mobile units roaming in a typical area of up to 25 square miles. A network is proposed to interconnect service areas to expand the coverage to a much larger geographic area. Efficient use is made of the limited bandwidth available for network communication. The network is able to manage mobile units that move from one service area to another during a call, and can efficiently locate mobile units throughout the network area...|$|E

The time of arrivals are differenced between the cell sites and hyperbolic trilateration is used {{to estimate the}} position of the cellular telephone.

40|$|This report {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of adaptive arrays to the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Phone</b> <b>Service</b> (AMPS) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) cellular systems. Adaptive arrays have been proposed as early as in the 1960 s to improve the signal quality, but most of its applications were restricted to defense purposes. Recently, {{there has been a}} surge in interest of applying adaptive arrays for cellular systems. This work introduces new blind adaptive array algorithms for AMPS and CDMA signals. The theoretical capacity limit using an adaptive array at the base station for an AMPS cellular system is derived in this work. One of the significant contributions in this research is a macrocell channel model which provides angle-of-arrival (AOA) statistics of the multipath components. Practical issues involved in the implementation of an adaptive array are addressed and the author's implementation of an 8 -element adaptive array operating at 2. 05 GHz is explained. This research also analyzes the capacity that can be o#ered by an adaptive array in a system where CDMA users co-exist with existing AMPS users. A novel cellular CDMA system which exploits adaptive arrays is introduced and the capacity o#ered by this system is compared with existing and other systems exploiting spatial dimension...|$|E
