40|$|The rate <b>and</b> <b>force</b> {{of manual}} chest {{percussion}} as applied by 35 physiotherapists was investigated. The influence of gender, body weight, {{body mass index}} (BMI), rate and frequency of usage on force were examined. Percussion was applied to a healthy male for 35 seconds and the rate <b>and</b> <b>force</b> were measured using a force platform. The rate <b>and</b> <b>force</b> varied among subjects. The mean (SD) rate <b>and</b> <b>force</b> of percussion were 6. 60 (1. 00) Hertz and 58. 10 (15. 32) Newtons respectively. There was no relationship between <b>force</b> <b>and</b> 1) gender, 2) body weight, 3) BMI or 4) frequency of usage of percussion.
