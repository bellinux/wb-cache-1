5|$|The {{situation}} awaiting Mary Godwin in England was {{fraught with}} complications, {{some of which}} she had not foreseen. Either before or during the journey, she had become pregnant. She and Percy now found themselves penniless, and, to Mary's genuine surprise, her father refused to have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> The couple moved with Claire into lodgings at Somers Town, and later, Nelson Square. They maintained their intense programme of reading and writing, and entertained Percy Shelley's friends, such as Thomas Jefferson Hogg and the writer Thomas Love Peacock. Percy Shelley sometimes left home for short periods to dodge creditors. The couple's distraught letters reveal their pain at these separations.|$|E

25|$|During {{his first}} police interview, Hodgson denied {{having an affair}} with Nicholl and also denied <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> disappearance. The next day, Nicholl's mobile phone was {{switched}} on and messages were sent which led her family and the police to believe that she was alive and well. The text messages were later revealed to have been sent from locations as far afield as Carlisle in Cumbria and Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders. Later, the authenticity of these messages were put into doubt by the police when they stated in November 2005 that the inquiry had turned from a disappearance into a murder investigation. At the end of July 2005, police found David Hodgson in a hut near to Hudswell. He had taken an overdose of pills and wine. In later police interviews, Hodgson admitted that he and Nicholl were lovers, but that their affair had ended 12 months earlier.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fifth}} season opener, Max proposes to Naomi after leaving his bride-to-be {{standing}} at the altar. They elope and get married. When they return to Naomi's place to celebrate, Alec, Max's business partner tells Naomi that her and Max's relationship is a mistake. He tries multiple times to sabotage their relationship, but ultimately fails. Fed up of always fighting with Alec, Naomi asks Max to choose between her and Alec. While Max chooses her, which forces him to fire Alec from his company, their relationship becomes strained. Max and Naomi search for a replacement to Alec and when she sees the resume of Bryce Woodbridge, she tells Max to meet him as {{he seems to be}} the best candidate. However, after she discovers that Bryce is actually a woman, Naomi says she will do the job. After an unsuccessful attempt at the job, she asks Bryce to reconsider their offer. Bryce accepts the position but manages to fire Max, which was set up by Alec. He later admits to Naomi that he is in love with Max, who in the meantime has left for a gamer conference in Iceland. Naomi finds out that he had been hiding at his parents' house. The couple seeks the help of a marriage counselor. Max explains he didn't want Naomi to run his life and the counselor says that Naomi lost herself. The pair later agrees to divorce and Max decides to go back to MIT.

2500|$|On 27 November Karen Matthews gave evidence. Sobbing throughout, {{she denied}} having <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> daughter's disappearance, {{claiming}} that Meehan {{told her to}} 'take the blame' for what had happened.

2500|$|It {{was around}} this time that critics also began to notice a real change in Mitchell's voice, {{particularly}} on her older songs; the singer later admitted to feeling the same way, explaining that [...] "I'd go to hit a note {{and there was nothing}} there". While her more limited range and huskier vocals have sometimes been attributed to her smoking (she has been described as [...] "one of the world's last great smokers"), Mitchell believes that the changes in her voice that became noticeable in the 1990s were due to other problems, including vocal nodules, a compressed larynx, and the lingering effects of having had polio. In an interview in 2004, she denied that [...] "my terrible habits" [...] had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> more limited range and pointed out that singers often lose the upper register when they pass fifty. In addition, she contended that in her opinion her voice became a more interesting and expressive alto range when she could no longer hit the high notes, let alone hold them like she did in her youth.|$|E

Unfortunately, she meets {{the owner of the}} dress at the party; in her anxiety to escape, she falls into the swimming pool. She eventually promises the client to make another dress for the client under her own clothing line. Akin and Mary start to call each other often.

Mary tells her that the moment Akin finds out that she's now the Chairman, he will resign, she advises her to call him instead and talk to him. Akin's mother listened to the advice and calls Akin.
