5|$|The Jain scriptures discuss various misconceptions {{that are}} harboured {{in case of}} Ahimsa. They often oppose the Vedic beliefs in sacrifices and other {{practices}} that justified violence in various ways. Ācārya Amritacandra's Puruṣārthasiddhyupāya discuss these wrong beliefs at length to <b>alert</b> <b>the</b> Jain laity to them. These misconceptions are as follows.|$|E
5|$|And {{there were}} already {{problems}} with the system. The anti-personnel portion of the program had already failed. The presence and movements of enemy troops were to be detected by the utilization of small, wide-area Gravel mines that were to <b>alert</b> <b>the</b> acoustic sensors. Unfortunately, the mines rapidly deteriorated in the heat and humidity of Laos, nullifying their effectiveness. The focus of any interdiction campaign, therefore, would have to concentrate on PAVN supply transportation. The war against trucks was about to begin.|$|E

At the time, Betances was one of five doctors that would {{have to take care of}} 24,000 residents.

Tribal shamans <b>alert</b> <b>the</b> player to natural disasters, notably tsunamis and volcanic eruptions, shortly before they occur. These disasters can be inhibited through creative, physical manipulation of the environment: a tsunami can be jellified, wildfires extinguished, and lava flows diverted. Although there is no 'explicit sandbox' mode, Chahi stated that each mission features a distinct map, which the player can return to and manipulate further.|$|E

A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881. His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E
