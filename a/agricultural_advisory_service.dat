40|$|The article {{provides}} {{a conceptual framework}} and discusses research methods for analyzing pluralistic <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services.</b> The framework can also assist policy-makers in identifying reform options. It addresses the following question: Which forms of providing and financing <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> work best in which situation? The framework 'disentangles' <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> by distinguishing between (1) governance structures, (2) capacity, (3) management, and (4) advisory methods. The framework suggests an impact chain approach to analyze the performance and impact of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> and discusses theoretical and empirical research methods {{that can be used}} when applying the framework. The framework shows that reforms of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> can combine different reform elements—such as decentralization, contracting out, using new advisory methods, and changing the management style—in different ways so as to best fit local circumstances. Using a New Institutional Economics approach (transaction costs approach), the article shows that the following sets of contextual factors need to be considered in this regard: the policy environment; the capacity of potential service providers; the type of production systems and market access of farm households; and the characteristics of local communities. The framework can be used to develop assessment tools for <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services,</b> to inform processes of reforming of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> and to guide inter-disciplinary research. The framework is unique in combining the insights from different disciplines, which have, so far, been treated separately in the literature. The framework can help policy-makers and analysts to move from 'ideological' discussions on reform models to an evidence-based 'best fit' approach...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{develops}} {{a framework for}} the design and analysis of pluralistic <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> and reviews research methods from different disciplines {{that can be used}} when applying the framework. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> are defined in the paper as the entire set of organizations that support and facilitate people engaged in agricultural production to solve problems and to obtain information, skills and technologies to improve their livelihoods and well-being [...] . To classify pluralistic <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services,</b> the paper distinguishes between organizations from the public, the private and the third sector that can be involved in (a) providing and (b) financing of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services.</b> The framework for analyzing pluralistic <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> presented in the paper addresses the need for analytical approaches that help policy-makers to identify those reform options that best fit country-specific frame conditions. Thus, the paper supports a shift from a “one-size-fits-all” to a “best fit” approach in the reform of public services [...] . Based on a review of the literature, the paper presents a variety of quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches derived from different disciplines that can be applied when using the framework in empirical research projects. The disciplines include agricultural and institutional economics, communication theory, adult education, and public administration and management.

30|$|This study {{investigates the}} issue by {{analyzing}} survey data from Uzbekistan, which is a cotton producing transition country. In general, the support of agriculture in transition economies has entered a new phase, with large-scale structural adjustment programs that focus on agricultural transformations. Specific reforms included land tenure policies and farm restructuring, which have been extensively reviewed in the literature (Liefert and Liefert [2012]). In this period, access to improved agricultural knowledge has become a priority because rural inhabitants who are not knowledgeable enough in farm production started obtaining agricultural land. New market mechanisms also required the acquiring of new sets of skills to run farms efficiently. In these regards, donor financed agricultural development programs stressed farmer supported educational programs {{and the establishment of}} extension services. To some extent, domestic rural policies also included launching agricultural training programs and improving the role of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>service</b> organizations.
