5|$|Sanders {{says that}} Jesus' mission {{was not about}} repentance, {{although}} he acknowledges that this opinion is unpopular. He argues that repentance appears as a strong theme only in Luke, that repentance was John the Baptist's message, and that Jesus' ministry {{would not have been}} scandalous if the sinners he <b>ate</b> <b>with</b> had been repentant. According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus taught that God was generously giving people an opportunity to repent.|$|E
5|$|The late 17th {{century in}} England {{was a time}} of great {{progress}} in design. Following the austere years of Commonwealth rule, a great flourishing and development in both architecture and the arts began after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Royalist exiles and wealthy young men who made the Grand Tour, returned home with new ideas—often extravagant variations on classical themes. This was, for England, the dawn of the Baroque era. The new wave of architects such as Roger Pratt, John Webb, and Sir Christopher Wren were not just building vast edifices in Renaissance-inspired styles, but also transforming existing older houses. Representative of the utilisation of older houses is Coleshill House in Berkshire, where Pratt transformed the medieval, but now redundant, great hall into a classically inspired entrance hall complete with an imperial staircase. Great Halls were considered redundant now that employers wished to live separately from their servants, and no longer <b>ate</b> <b>with</b> them in a Great Hall. All evidence and odours of cooking and staff were banished from the principal parts of the house. Employers began to live in fine airy rooms, above the ground floor, with privacy from their servants, who were now confined, unless required, to specifically delegated areas—often the ground and uppermost attic floors. This was a period of great social change in British history, and the educated prided themselves on enlightenment and elegance. While Belton is not in the Baroque style, it displays all the traits typical of the new tendencies.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{during the}} period of Ottoman Empire, Alevis were {{forbidden}} to proselytise, and Alevism regenerated itself internally by paternal descent. To prevent penetration by hostile outsiders, the Alevis insisted on strict endogamy which eventually made them into a quasi-ethnic group. Alevi taboos limited interaction with the dominant Sunni political-religious centre. Excommunication was the ultimate punishment threatening those who married outsiders, cooperated with outsiders economically, or <b>ate</b> <b>with</b> outsiders. It was also forbidden to use the state (Sunni) courts.|$|E
25|$|In response, Abraham inquired of the Lord if {{he would}} spare the city if 50 righteous people were found in it, to which the Lord agreed he would not destroy it {{for the sake of}} the righteous yet {{dwelling}} therein. Abraham then inquired of God for mercy at lower numbers (first 45, then 40, then 30, then 20, and finally at 10), with the Lord agreeing each time. Two angels were sent to Sodom to investigate and were met by Abraham's nephew Lot, who convinced the angels to lodge with him, and they <b>ate</b> <b>with</b> Lot.|$|E
25|$|Slaves {{were the}} Nootkas' most {{valuable}} property (p.88), {{and might be}} killed if they tried to run away. Jewitt says that slaves <b>ate</b> <b>with</b> the family, the same food in different dishes (p.71), and were generally well-treated but {{had to work hard}} (p.88); often the king's household would run short of food, so he would beg elsewhere (p.59). Maquinna allowed Jewitt to undertake other work when not employed by him, and he used this privilege to make bracelets, fish-hooks, and so on, to trade with the chiefs of the village and other visitors. Other chiefs or kings, including the king Wickaninnish of the Tla-o-qui-aht (Clayoquot), attempted to buy Jewitt, but Maquinna declined (p.151). Machee Ulatilla, king of the Klaizzarts, wished to buy him, promising to release him to any European ship that passed, and {{in the end it was}} through his help that deliverance came.|$|E

500|$|... "The Mission" [...] {{then looks}} at how Jesus may have been viewed by the {{religious}} leaders of the time. The canonical gospels report over one hundred cases of Jesus healing or performing exorcisms, and [...] "making the unclean clean again". Jesus told lepers {{to go up to}} the Temple Mount, where they were usually excluded, and claimed that he could forgive sins without going through the ordinary channels. Jesus met and <b>ate</b> <b>with</b> sinners, the disabled and prostitutes, and fulfilled Old Testament prophecy by riding into the Temple Mount through the Golden Gate on a donkey at Passover. Bowen concludes that all these reasons would have meant that the Pharisees of the time would have seen him as threatening.|$|E
500|$|Exactly what Iguanodon <b>ate</b> <b>with</b> its {{well-developed}} jaws is not known. The size of {{the larger}} species, such as I. bernissartensis, would have allowed them access to food from ground level to tree foliage at [...] high. A diet of horsetails, cycads, and conifers was suggested by David Norman, although iguanodonts in general have been tied to the advance of angiosperm plants in the Cretaceous due to the dinosaurs' inferred low browsing habits. Angiosperm growth, according to this hypothesis, would have been encouraged by iguanodont feeding because gymnosperms would be removed, allowing more space for the weed-like early angiosperms to grow. The evidence is not conclusive, though. Whatever its exact diet, due to its size and abundance, Iguanodon {{is regarded as a}} dominant medium to large herbivore for its ecological communities. In England, this included the small predator Aristosuchus, larger predators Eotyrannus, Baryonyx, and Neovenator, low-feeding herbivores Hypsilophodon and Valdosaurus, fellow [...] "iguanodontid" [...] Mantellisaurus, the armoured herbivore Polacanthus, and sauropods like Pelorosaurus.|$|E

The motion, known as the Patman bill, was decisively defeated, but the veterans stayed in their camp. Butler arrived with his young son Thomas, in mid-July the day before the official eviction by the Hoover administration. He walked through the camp and spoke to the veterans; he told them that they were fine soldiers and they had a right to lobby Congress just as much as any corporation. He and his son spent the night and <b>ate</b> <b>with</b> the men, and in the morning Butler gave a speech to the camping veterans. He instructed them to keep their sense of humor and cautioned them not to do anything that would cost public sympathy. On July 28, army cavalry units led by General Douglas MacArthur dispersed the Bonus Army by riding through it and using gas. During the conflict several veterans were killed or injured and Butler declared himself a [...] "Hoover-for-Ex-President-Republican".|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} few years, Burnham worked as a mounted {{messenger}} for the Western Union Telegraph Company in California and Arizona Territory. On one occasion his horse was stolen from him by Tiburcio Vásquez, a famous Californio bandit. At 14, he began {{his life as a}} scout and Indian tracker in the Apache Wars, during which he took part in the United States Army expedition to find and capture or kill the Apache chief Geronimo. In Prescott, Arizona, he met an old scout named Lee who served under General George Crook. Lee taught Burnham how to track Apache by detecting the odor of burning mescal, a species of aloe they often cooked and <b>ate.</b> <b>With</b> careful study of the local air currents and canyons, trackers could follow the odor to Apache hiding places {{from as far away as}} 6 miles (9.7km). During the Apache uprisings, the young Burnham also learned much from Al Sieber, the Chief of Scouts, and his assistant Archie McIntosh, who had been Chief of Scouts in Crook's last two campaigns. Burnham learned much about scouting from these Indian trackers, who were advanced in age and fading from the frontier, including the vital lesson that [...] "it is imperative that a scout should know the history, tradition, religion, social customs, and superstitions of whatever country or people he is called on to work in or among." [...] But the scout who was to have perhaps the greatest influence on Burnham during his formative years was a man named Holmes.|$|E

40|$|White {{and whole}} meal breads have been {{classified}} as high glycemic index (GI) foods {{which in turn}} produce the greatest rise in blood glucose. One of the commercial bread products in Malaysia known as Brown breads (BB) has been recently marketed as a healthy choice for diabetics due to its low GI value. This {{study was conducted to}} examine the effect of BB when <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> different fillings on blood glucose response among healthy individuals and to describe the influences of these fillings in reducing blood glucose response. Five test meals using BB (BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> baked beans, BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> vegetable, BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> apple, BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> roast chicken and BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> seaweeds) had been prepared for this study. Postprandial blood glucose response was determined for each test meal and reference food (glucose) that contained 50 g carbohydrate respectively. A total of 21 healthy subjects were recruited by advertisement to participate. Only 20 subjects (15 males, 5 females, Mean + SD Age : 24. 4 + 3. 7 years; BMI 23. 4 + 3. 0 kgm- 2) completed this study. After an overnight fast, subjects consumed BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> fillings according to the assigned group given and three repeated tests of reference food (glucose). Fasting capillary blood glucose samples were taken at time 0 and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min respectively after the meal began. The blood glucose response was obtained by calculating the incremental area under the curve (AUC). Blood glucose response after consuming reference food (251. 8 + 12. 1 m m o l. m i n / L) w a s s i g n i f i c a n t l y h i g h e r t h a n a l l t h e t e s t m e a l s (p < 0. 05). Among the test meals, BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> baked beans produced the highest rise in blood glucose (97. 0 + 16. 9 mmol. min/L) whereas BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> seaweeds demonstrated the lowest response in blood glucose (33. 3 + 6. 5 mmol. min/L) and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0. 05). The postprandial blood glucose response after ingestion of BB when <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> vegetable was 73. 3 + 19. 1 mmol. min/L followed by BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> apple (58. 9 Jurnal Sains Kesihatan Malaysia 6 (1) 2008 : 1 - 102 + 12. 2 mmol. min/L) and BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> roast chicken (56. 5 + 10. 1 mmol. min/ L).
