25|$|The {{deposition}} of Ignatios and the sudden promotion of Photios caused scandal and ecclesiastical division on an ecumenical scale as the Pope {{and the rest}} of the western bishops took up the cause of Ignatios. The latter's deposition without a formal ecclesiastical trial meant that Photios's election was uncanonical, and eventually Pope Nicholas I sought to involve himself in determining the legitimacy of the succession. His legates were dispatched to Constantinople with instructions to investigate, but finding Photios well ensconced, they acquiesced in the confirmation of his election at a synod in 861. On their return to Rome, they discovered that this was not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>what</b> Nicholas had intended, and in 863 at a synod in Rome the pope deposed Photios, and reappointed Ignatius as the rightful patriarch, triggering a schism. Four years later, Photios was to respond on his own part by calling a Council and excommunicating the pope on grounds of heresy – over the question of the double procession of the Holy Spirit. The situation was additionally complicated by the question of papal authority over the entire Church and by disputed jurisdiction over newly converted Bulgaria.|$|E
500|$|It was {{the kind}} of jump in which, even when {{arriving}} [...] in the landing position and not knowing <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>what</b> lies ahead, I remember that my legs were trembling. That's how terrified I was. ... Overcoming your own fears is the best feeling. The nature of the sport is that one has to challenge themselves. That's why this jump has remained a highlight of my career.|$|E
500|$|During the 2000 United States presidential election, ABC News {{wrote that}} she was {{determined}} to do [...] "whatever possible to keep him [...] out of office". She told the site, [...] "If you're black in this country, if you're a woman in this country, if you are any minority in this country <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>what</b> could possibly possess you to vote Republican?... You won't have one fucking right left." [...] She added, [...] "I don't like Bush. I don't trust him. I don't like his record. He's stupid. He's lazy." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1993–94 Sheffield Shield season, Ponting spoke of his goals for the summer. [...] "I've got myself the goal of making 1,000 runs in the season. Hopefully, I can stay in the middle long enough or do that. You can't worry about other people's expectation. I don't care <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>what</b> is written in the press. I like to read it but it doesn't go too far into my head." [...] In Tasmania's final {{round-robin}} match of the season, they needed to defeat South Australia outright to qualify for the final. Set 366 runs to win in 102 overs, Ponting joined Dene Hills at the crease with the score at 2/35. Ponting scored 161 in a 290-run partnership that ended with Tasmania needing just 41 runs for victory. Despite Tasmania losing four quick wickets after his dismissal, they won with four wickets in hand. Disappointingly for Ponting, he could not repeat the performance in the final against New South Wales. He scored just one and 28, as Tasmania were defeated by an innings and 61 runs. The season saw Ponting score 965 runs at 48.25, close to his 1,000 run goal.|$|E

2500|$|Responding to Flavio Briatore's {{resignation}} from Renault F1, Formula One Management's Bernie Ecclestone {{stated that}} [...] "It is a pity that Flavio has ended his Formula One career in this way", [...] "You can't defend him <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>What</b> {{he did was}} completely unnecessary. It's a pity that it's happened", although Ecclestone denied that the scandal would 'finish' the sport, citing the sport's recovery from the death of Ayrton Senna and the retirement of seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher.|$|E

2500|$|Rubber Soul was {{released}} on compact disc on 30 April 1987, with the 14-song UK track line-up now the international standard. Having been available only as an import in the US in the past, the 14-track UK version of the album was issued on LP and cassette on 21 July 1987. As with the Help! album, Rubber Soul featured a contemporary stereo digital remix of the album prepared by George Martin. Martin expressed concern to EMI over the original 1965 stereo remix, claiming it sounded [...] "very woolly, and not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>what</b> I thought should be a good issue". He {{went back to the}} original four-tracks tapes and remixed them for stereo.|$|E
2500|$|According to Michael Lewis in Vanity Fair: [...] "Many of the {{articles}} attacking her accused her of making a very specific forecast — {{as many as a}} hundred defaults within a year! — that failed to materialize... But that's not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>what</b> she had said: her words were being misrepresented so that her message might be more easily attacked. 'She was referring to the complacency of the ratings agencies and investment advisers who say there is nothing to worry about,' said a person at 60 Minutes who reviewed the transcripts of the interview for me, to make sure I had heard what I thought I had heard. She says there is something to worry about, and it will be apparent to everyone in the next 12 months." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zinaida {{started writing}} poetry {{at the age}} of seven. By the time she met Dmitry Merezhkovsky in 1888, she was already a {{published}} poet. [...] "By the year 1880 I was writing verses, being a great believer in 'inspiration', and making it a point never to take my pen away from paper. People around me saw these poems as a sign of my being 'spoiled', but I never tried to conceal them and, of course, I wasn't spoiled <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>what</b> with my religious upbringing," [...] she wrote in 1902 in a letter to Valery Bryusov. A good-looking girl, Zinaida attracted a lot of attention in Borzhomi, but Merezhkovsky, a well-educated introvert, impressed her first and foremost as a perfect kindred spirit. Once he proposed, she accepted him without hesitation, and never came to regret what might have seemed a hasty decision.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, {{when asked}} about the {{possibility}} of someone else making Star Wars films, Lucas said, [...] "Probably not, it's my thing." [...] In a 2008 interview in Total Film, Lucas ruled out anybody else making Star Wars films. Asked if he was happy for new Star Wars films to be made after his death, he said: [...] "I've left pretty explicit instructions for there not to be any more features. There will definitely be no Episodes VII–IX. That's because there isn't any story. I mean, I never thought of anything. And now there have been novels about the events after Episode VI, which isn't <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>what</b> I would have done with it. The Star Wars story is really the tragedy of Darth Vader. That is the story. Once Vader dies, he doesn't come back to life, the Emperor doesn't get cloned and Luke doesn't get married..." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 18, Michelle Obama {{attracted}} criticism when {{during a}} campaign speech in Milwaukee, Wisconsin she said, [...] "Let me tell you, {{for the first}} time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country. Not just because Barack is doing well, but I think people are hungry for change." [...] Barack's response to the criticism was, [...] "Statements like this are made, and people try to take it out of context and make a great big deal out of it, and that isn't <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>what</b> she meant. What she meant was, this is the first time that she's been proud of the politics of America," [...] he said. [...] "Because she's pretty cynical about the political process, and with good reason, and she's not alone. But she has seen large numbers of people get involved in the process, and she's encouraged." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the First World War, Allenby {{initially}} {{served on}} the Western Front. At the outbreak of war in August 1914, a British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent to France. It consisted of four infantry divisions and one cavalry division, the latter commanded by Allenby. The cavalry division first saw action in semi-chaotic circumstances covering the retreat after the Battle of Mons opposing the German Army's invasion of France. One of Allenby's subordinates claimed at the time: [...] "He cannot explain verbally, with any lucidity <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>what</b> his plans are". When a headquarters officer asked why a cavalry brigade was miles from where {{it was supposed to}} be, he received the reply: [...] "He told me he was getting as far away from the Bull as possible. It was a most scandalous affair, and he was in almost open rebellion against Allenby at the time". The division distinguished itself under Allenby's direction in the subsequent fighting, with minimal resources at its disposal, at the First Battle of Ypres.|$|E
