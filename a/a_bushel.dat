Thomas Martin was a farmer who sold his produce to the people of Jersey Shore and to {{the men and women who}} were just passing through. Mr. Martin was noted for his strong beliefs regarding the prices that he set. For example, if he believed that his potatoes were worth 35 cents <b>a</b> <b>bushel,</b> he would sell them for 35 cents <b>a</b> <b>bushel,</b> no more no less. If his competitors would sell potatoes for 50 cents <b>a</b> <b>bushel,</b> Martin would not raise his price and if others lowered the price to 25 cents per bushel, he would not lower his price. This firmness and fairness allowed Thomas Martin to rise to a position of prominence in Jersey Shore and Lycoming County. His reputation for fairness and honesty was passed onto his son Lewis Martin who went on to serve as a Lycoming County prothonotary and as a deputy U.S. Marshal.|$|E

Spruce seedlings were packed in, each requiring <b>a</b> <b>bushel</b> or two of soil, and by the 1940s a new spruce forest had been established on the slopes overlooking the Valley. In 1943–44, as part of the West Virginia Maneuver Area, the U.S. Army used the Canaan Valley area as a practice artillery and mortar range and maneuver area before troops were sent to European Theater of Operations to fight in World War II.|$|E
25|$|As {{economic}} difficulties worsened, Iowa farmers sought to find local solutions. Faced with extremely low farm prices, including corn at ten cents <b>a</b> <b>bushel</b> and pork at three cents a pound, some farmers in western Iowa formed the Farmers Holiday Association. This group, {{which had its}} greatest strength {{in the area around}} Sioux City, tried to withhold farm products from markets. They believed this practice would force up farm prices. The Farm Holiday Association had only limited success as many farmers did not cooperate and the withholding itself did little to raise prices. Farmers experienced little relief until 1933 when the federal government, as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, created a federal farm aid program.|$|E

This second mill was a vital link {{the economy of}} Nippenose Township until 1873 when a new mill was built in its place. Antes furthered his enterprises by building a carding and fulling mill {{on the banks of}} Antes Creek in 1810. Antes died in 1820. Ownership of the mills was passed onto his son-in-law Elias P. Youngman. Youngman and his sons expanded the business yet again in 1835 by adding machinery that was able to clean clover seed. Clover seed was very expensive at the time, <b>a</b> <b>bushel</b> of the seed sold for as much as $24.00.

25|$|The {{demand for}} ethanol fuel {{produced}} from field corn was spurred in the U.S. {{by the discovery}} that methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) was contaminating groundwater. MTBE use as an oxygenate additive was widespread due to mandates of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1992 to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. As a result, by 2006 MTBE use in gasoline was banned in almost 20 states. There was also concern that widespread and costly litigation might be taken against the U.S. gasoline suppliers, and a 2005 decision refusing legal protection for MTBE, opened a new market for ethanol fuel, the primary substitute for MTBE. At a time when corn prices were around US$2 <b>a</b> <b>bushel,</b> corn growers recognized the potential of this new market and delivered accordingly. This demand shift took place {{at a time when}} oil prices were already significantly rising.|$|E
25|$|Stock prices {{dropped by}} 20 percent from September 24 to October 1, while trade was minimal. Between January 1870 to September 1870, only 4 {{million shares of}} stock were exchanged. Dozens of {{brokerage}} firms went bankrupt, while those who bought paper gold from Fisk's gold room went unpaid. Farmers, who constituted 50 percent of the country's workforce, suffered the worst; wheat prices on the Chicago trade fell from $1.40 to $0.77 cents <b>a</b> <b>bushel.</b> Corn dropped from $0.95 to $0.68 cents; while other commodities such as rye, oats, and barley had similar losses. The New York Tribune reported that goods ready for export could not be shipped. American agriculture went into steep decline and would be plagued by tight money and dwindling markets for years to come. Grant's and Boutwell's actions to break the Gold Ring, however, kept the Wall Street panic from growing into a national depression. Butterfield was allowed to resign from the U.S. Treasury without an investigation in October, 1869.|$|E
25|$|The {{price of}} corn {{has been declining}} steadily. Currently, {{the price of one}} bushel of corn is about one dollar less than the cost of growing it. In 2005, Iowa grain {{elevators}} were paying $1.45 per bushel ($57.10 per metric ton), while it was costing the farmer about $2.50/bu ($98/t) to grow it. This is a benefit for everyone except the corn farmer. While commodity prices are falling, the cost of production is rising. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, production costs increased $22 billion in 2007, and they are expected to keep rising this year. Unfortunately, commodity corn farmers have little control over the price they receive for their product. In order for corn farmers to generate any profit, they basically take whatever price they can get for their crop. A working farm needs a particular amount of income to maintain itself, and with falling corn prices the only choice for the corn farmer is to grow and sell more corn. This in turn leads to overproduction and even lower prices. Government policies used to protect corn prices from collapsing by establishing a target price based on the cost of production. Whenever the market price fell below that number, farmers were given the opportunity to take out a loan from the government using the crop as collateral, in turn allowing the farmer to store the grain until the market bounced back. In the mid-1970s this structure was removed and there was no longer an established floor price for <b>a</b> <b>bushel</b> of corn. Instead, subsidies were put in place that would reimburse the farmer for the difference between the market price and a target price. This encouraged corn farmers to grow as much as possible and to sell their crop at any price. Federal payments to corn farmers account for about half of their income, which translates to about 25% of the $19 billion taxpayers pay yearly on farmer’s payments. Contrary to what many people think, the current rise in food prices is doing little if anything to increase profit for the farmer. As retail prices for food increase, the share of the food dollar that returns to the farmer has fallen. Farmers are only seeing a very small fraction (between 2 and 25% depending on the product) of the retail price. The extra cost is instead going towards production, processing, transportation and marketing, which all cost significantly more today than in the past few years. Corn farmers continue to produce an undifferentiated commodity, and the profits are shifting to those who are benefited by overproduction and low crop prices: the companies who process, package and market the final products.|$|E

500|$|Along with Jim Miller's {{opinions}} in Rolling Stone magazine, Woffinden's 1974 album review for the NME {{was one of}} the most scathing critiques.

[...] By contrast, Michael Gross of Circus Raves magazine viewed the album as the equal of Harrison's acclaimed All Things Must Pass (1970) and praised the song and its arrangement, writing: [...] "Scott again excels on 'Far East Man', with a horn solo that would vindicate any context in which it was put." [...] In a similarly positive assessment for Melody Maker, Brian Harrigan opined that Dark Horse [...] "should certainly do a tremendous amount to salvage George's battered reputation" [...] but found the extended playout to [...] "Far East Man" [...] overlong – an example, he said, where [...] "you can have just too much of a good thing".|$|E
