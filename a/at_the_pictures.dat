5|$|Reyes' numerology {{theories}} {{do not go}} down well at the FBI, but {{the pattern}} of the killings, when viewed on a map, seem to line up as the number six (6). After looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> of the victims, Scully realizes that the pattern on the victims was not three circles, but instead, three sixes, the mark of the devil. Meanwhile, Wayno has several additional run-ins with the mysterious man, who continues to give cryptic advice.|$|E
25|$|Arriving on land just as Lauren's {{father is}} about to cancel the wedding, Stu makes a defiant speech where he rejects being boring and instead states {{that he is in}} fact quite wild. Impressed, Lauren's father gives the couple his blessing. After they {{exchange}} their vows, Alan presents Stu with a special gift at the post-reception dance: a musical guest performance by Mike Tyson. Teddy later discovers that he had taken many pictures during the night on his cell phone. The group, along with Tyson, agree to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> together once (some of which reveal Teddy lost his finger playing the knife game) before erasing the evidence of their exploits once again.|$|E
500|$|The {{group is}} first pictured sitting around {{backstage}} while waiting {{to have their}} hair and make-up done. In another scene, Little Mix are filmed on their tour bus. This scene features Jade Thirlwall scribbling in a notebook as the other group members play around, laugh and take pictures of each other sleeping using the Samsung Galaxy. The group then look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> they took together. In a different scene, Perrie Edwards is seen cuddling a puppy. Little Mix are also pictured singing [...] "Change Your Life" [...] {{to each other in}} a studio and preparing to go on stage at their Rhyl Pavilion tour date. Other scenes features the group in a dance rehearsal, using funny facial expressions and bonding with their mothers backstage. During the dance rehearsal, the group is seen practising dance moves to their DNA Tour setlist with their tour choreographer and backing dancers. In other scenes, the group is seen playing with their own Little Mix dolls and Thirlwall, sporting blue hair, is wheeled away in a cardboard box. Before going onstage, Leigh-Anne Pinnock is seen smiling as a make-up artist applies her final touches while Thirlwall is pictured applying her own make-up. The group then centre themselves as they show each other support by hugging one another before heading to the stage. After the show, the foursome is seen showing their solidarity by embracing one another again.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was {{directed}} by Syndrome. It was shot in Kesha's old neighborhood and the car featured in the video belongs to her. Kesha explained the experience saying, [...] "the video I'm excited about because I actually got to shoot it in my old neighborhood and the guy driving my gold car {{is a friend of}} mine". The video's party scene was shot in her friend's house, which they refer to as the [...] "drunk tank". The singer said [...] "the last party scene is in this house called the drunk tank, which is one of my friend's houses that we all go party at. So I like it cause its super-honest and genuine." [...] The video begins with Kesha waking in a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes her way down a staircase looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen and walks in on a family who are having breakfast, startling them. She shrugs and then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, she picks up a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children and trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects a guy and is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the T-top as she dangles the handcuffs hanging from her left arm. The next scene shows Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one she woke up in. The official music video has received over 360 million views on YouTube as of July 2017.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{episode of}} Another World aired on June 25, 1999. The episode {{revolved}} around the wedding of Cass and Lila. In the show's final scene, Rachel and Carl happily embraced in the Cory living room, she remarked [...] "All's well that ends well," [...] and, after looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> of all her loved ones, Rachel went upstairs with Carl. The final image was a still frame of Mac and the show faded to black.|$|E
2500|$|The zoetrope {{consists}} of a cylinder with slits cut vertically in the sides. On the inner surface of the cylinder is a band with images from a set of sequenced pictures. As the cylinder spins, the user looks through the slits <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> across. The scanning of the slits keeps the pictures from simply blurring together, and the user sees a rapid succession of images, producing the illusion of motion. From the late 19th century, devices working on similar principles have been developed, named analogously as linear zoetropes and 3D zoetropes, with traditional zoetropes referred to as [...] "cylindrical zoetropes" [...] if distinction is needed.|$|E

2500|$|One subtype is Sight word, {{which is}} {{sometimes}} called the [...] "look-say" [...] method. A sight vocabulary of 50-100 words is first memorized [...] and subsequent words are learned as wholes, often by seeing them used repeatedly {{in the context of}} a story. It tells children to find meaning by guessing, by recognizing whole words they have memorized, by looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures,</b> and by creating a context based on surrounding words. It encourages students to [...] "construct their own meaning" [...] (with guidance from peers and facilitator of consensus process). [...] It relies heavily on the child's experience with language as a whole.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} some {{positive}} reviews, however. One modern critic said [...] "the story is adequately paced, the acting is engaging, and we still get a thrill seeing the Army guys empty their cartridges at the unstoppable insects." [...] Another modern reviewer found the screenplay effective, especially the beginning: [...] "As in Deadly Mantis, the complete disappearance of the victims is especially chilling, as {{is the notion of}} 150 men, women and children being devoured overnight while in their beds. This aspect is like something out of Lovecraft, although it is not exploited as well as it could have been." [...] Producer-director Bert I. Gordon said he did not care whether reviews were bad; what mattered was whether people went to see the film: [...] "The movie audience these days consists almost entirely of teenagers. Either they're naïve and go to get scared, or they're sophisticated and enjoy scoffing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b> There isn't much a teenager can scoff at these days, you know." [...] Lead actor Peter Graves also felt the film worked on a certain level. [...] "I think they played OK. ... All of that was ludicrous, but there were a certain amount of people who 'bought' it and loved it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The next morning, {{they meet}} with Chow {{in the desert}} and {{exchange}} the money, {{only to find that}} [...] "Doug" [...] is the black drug dealer who accidentally sold Alan Rohypnol. With the wedding set to occur in 5 hours, Phil calls Tracy and tells her that they cannot find Doug. When [...] "Black Doug" [...] mentions that, [...] "If you take Roofies, you're more likely to end up on the floor than on the roof," [...] Stu realizes where Doug is. The trio travels back to their hotel where they find a badly sunburned Doug on the roof. Stu, Phil, and Alan had moved him there on his mattress the night before as a practical joke, but forgot where they left him. Doug had thrown his own mattress onto the statue, in an attempt to signal help. Before leaving, Stu makes arrangements to go on a date with Jade the following week. With less than four hours before the wedding and with no flights to L.A. available, the four quickly drive home. Along the way, Doug reveals he has possession of Chow's original $80,000. Despite their late arrival, Doug and Tracy are married, the former learns the damaged Mercedes was a wedding gift, and Stu breaks up with Melissa, having grown tired of her controlling attitude. As the reception ends, Alan finds Stu's digital camera containing photos of the events they cannot remember, and the four agree to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> together before deleting the evidence of their exploits. All of them, save for Alan, are traumatized by what they see.|$|E
