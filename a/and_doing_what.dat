It is estimated that as little as 15% of learning from traditional classroom-style training results in sustained behavioral change within workplaces.|$|E

I think she's being more authentic <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> she wants to do instead of doing what people expect, which is good." [...] Kim, the show's musical director described the idea of the intimate concert, [...] "This project is the most mature project for Beyoncé, because {{to be able to be}} in an intimate setting like this like the Roseland, which is a historic place, it's an amazing thing. I think the challenge of it is to be able to present your whole album as its own concept, as its own piece and it's a great way to educate the people about what this album means to her; It's for her, it's for the fans, it's for anybody." ...|$|E

500|$|In early 1865, {{at the age}} of 13, Edgardo {{became a}} novice in the Canons Regular of the Lateran, adding the Pope's name to his own to become Pio Edgardo Mortara. He wrote {{repeatedly}} to his family, he recalled, [...] "dealing with religion <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> I could to convince them of the truth of the Catholic faith," [...] but received no reply until May 1867—his parents, who were now living in Florence, wrote that they still loved him dearly, but saw nothing of their son in the letters they had received. In July 1870, just before Edgardo turned 19, the French garrison in Rome was withdrawn for good after the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Italian troops captured the city on 20 September 1870.|$|E
500|$|Bob Bowman {{took over}} as head coach of Michigan for the 2004–05 season. [...] He put Tarwater on a new {{training}} program, with a greater focus on speed training and less on distance. [...] "We've also put him through weight training, and I think it's been improving his speed", Bowman said. [...] "He {{has a very strong}} work ethic and always wants to improve. Instead of just getting in the pool <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> we tell him to do, he actually thinks about it and asks questions. He wants to know the theory behind what he's doing." [...] Tarwater won the 2005 NCAA championship in the 200-yard butterfly. [...] His time of 1:42.30 was a Michigan and Big Ten record, and the third fastest time in NCAA history. In the 100-meter butterfly, he placed fourth.|$|E

500|$|The {{accepted}} cover, {{designed by}} Aimee Macauley, features {{a photo of}} Nas as a child superimposed over a backdrop of a New York city block, taken by Danny Clinch. In a 1994 interview, Nas discussed the concept behind the photo of him at age 7, stating [...] "That was the year I started to acknowledge everything [...] That's the year everything set off. That's the year I started seeing the future for myself <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> was right. The ghetto makes you think. The world is ours. I used to think I couldn't leave my projects. I used to think if I left, if anything happened to me, I {{thought it would be}} no justice or I would be just a dead slave or something. The projects used to be my world until I educated myself to see there's more out there." [...] As yet, Nas has not pointed to any outside influence for the artwork of his album cover. Yet according to Ego Trip, the cover of Illmatic is [...] "reputedly" [...] believed to have been inspired by a jazz album, Howard Hanger Trio's A Child Is Born (1974) [...] whose cover also features a photograph of a child, superimposed on an urban landscape.|$|E
500|$|On 31 July 2009, Digital Spy {{conducted}} a poll asking {{if it was}} [...] "time to move on" [...] from Ianto. However, a week later the website did not immediately publish the results, announcing [...] "unfortunately it seems that this particular Poll {{was the subject of}} a campaign by diehard fans to distort the outcome". Neil Wilkes opined that this action by the fans [...] "suggests the answer to the question 'Have people overreacted to Ianto's death?' is quite obvious". Later, a footnote amendment noted that 31.4% said it was time to move on, [...] "while the remainder demanded RTD's head on a plate", a reference to his own wording of the original poll, which gave readers the option of moving on from Ianto, or the executive producer's head on a plate. James McCarthy of Wales Online described the reaction from some fans as [...] "sickening" [...] and quoted [...] "crazed" [...] fans on DeviantArt and Facebook who made explicit death threats against the Children of Earth writers. Gareth David-Lloyd stated he was very disappointed in those fans, whose message board conduct he does not support at all and called [...] "completely unacceptable". David-Lloyd added that he [...] "would hope the writers would be able to ignore comments like that". A number of fans were upset by the tone of the first Wales Online article, and their response prompted a follow up from McCarthy. In their comments, fans pointed out that his article disproportionately highlights what they called the [...] "ill-conceived, knee-jerk reactions" [...] of a few individuals, and stressed that these reactions in no way represent the movement to bring Ianto Jones back, which they hold as fundamentally respectful towards the show's actors and writers. Fans have distanced themselves from the small minority of extremists, and have been keen to stress their peaceful activism, described as [...] "thousands of fans who are raising money for charity, sending polite letters, <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> we can to be supportive of the character and actor". In 2010, Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat told fans who contacted him that he wouldn't want to resurrect Ianto even if he could: [...] "Not reversing it. Stop asking." [...] In a 2011 poll published by the Liverpool Daily Post as part of a live Interview with writer John Fay, 70% of respondents replied that the decision to kill Ianto had been the right one, with 19% responding [...] "indifferent" [...] and only 11% stating that it had been the wrong decision, contrasting with the initial fan response. In response to a question, Fay also stated that he had not been affected by the [...] "scary" [...] fan reaction, maintaining that [...] "a universe in which fictional characters aren't 'allowed' to die is ridiculous and limiting".|$|E

In the book, Firestar is asked to find and rebuild SkyClan which described as Holmes [...] "will take him a long way outside the warrior code and all that he believes in". A review commented that [...] "themes of faith and responsibility give it depth" [...] and also added that [...] "It's quite satisfying watching Firestar and Sandstorm assemble a ragtag group of cats into a true clan" [...] and compared to movies such as The Bad News Bears to Major League.|$|E

Lamar has credited God for his fame and his deliverance from crime that often plagued Compton in the 1990s. Lamar also believes his career is divinely inspired and that he has a greater purpose to serve mankind, saying in an interview with Complex, [...] "I got a greater purpose, God put something in my heart to get across and that's what I'm going to focus on, using my voice as an instrument <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> needs to be done." ...|$|E

Oliver Cromwell was eager to enroll Brodie into his regime. Tempted, Lord Brodie resisted Oliver Cromwell's summons to discuss a union of Scotland and England, writing in his diary [...] "Oh Lord he has met with the lion and the bear before, but this is the Goliath; the strongest and greatest temptation is last.". Lord Brodie was the target of an unsuccessful royalist plot for his capture in 1650.

[...] Kerrang! also criticised the set for being [...] "slightly too focussed on their lengthy new material", claiming that this resulted in [...] "alienating some people", although going on to state that they admire the band for [...] "refusing to become the nostalgia act" [...] {{and that it is}} [...] "important that they still take these risks."
