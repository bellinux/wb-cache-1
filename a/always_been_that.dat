5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been {{described}} as being, in effect, an assertion of paramountcy by the Government of India over the states in a more pervasive form. While this contradicted the British statement that paramountcy would lapse on the transfer of power, the Congress position had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> independent India would inherit the position of being the paramount power.|$|E

For many years, NM Perera was the leader of the LSSP Parliamentary Group and was recognised by the public as the party leader. However, the actual leadership has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> of a group represented in the various bureaux of the Central Committee.|$|E
500|$|Dutton also {{commanded}} the brigade through heavy {{fighting on the}} outskirts of Basra and commented that the fighting had been more intense there than predicted, saying [...] "the planning assumption had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> the advancing coalition forces would simply sweep past Basra and it would implode by itself". Dutton's calmness during the invasion prompted journalist Tim Butcher, who reported on the war while attached to 3 Commando Brigade, to describe him as [...] "a lean, thinking man with none of the tub-thumping machismo of some officers" [...] and [...] "coldly professional in his job".|$|E
500|$|A Channel Seven {{spokeswoman}} {{revealed that}} the network received fewer than 30 telephone calls nationally after screening the [...] "lesbian kiss" [...] episode of the show. The calls were evenly split between those supporting the broadcast of the kiss, and those raising concerns. The show's series producer Cameron Welsh and Anderson both spoke out in defence of the storyline. Welsh said, [...] "The idea of this show has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> we hold a mirror to society – and when society changes, we change with it. What's ahead in Home and Away is right {{not only for the}} series, but also for the times we are living in". Anderson said that she felt it was the right time to tell this story and added, [...] "It's really important for us to reflect society, and this storyline is what is going on for many people in real life". She also said that she did not think the plot would be so shocking, but was glad the show was exploring a gay relationship.|$|E

500|$|Although Butch Trucks {{recalls the}} entire {{ensemble}} as comfortable with studio recording, another source claims that Johanson, Betts and Oakley were unfamiliar with studio recording, but nevertheless not intimidated. [...] "They {{were out of}} their element in New York, hustled by a chap with an English accent," [...] said Dowd of Barber. He spoke of Barber's direction as [...] "perhaps intimidating, or push-push, shove-shove. 'Do what the guy says and let’s get out of here.'" [...] "Dreams", which later gained regard among band members as {{the high point of}} the record, was the only song in which the group got stuck, due to Duane Allman's displeasure with his guitar solo. The performance captured on record came when Duane instructed the other members to turn off all the lights in the studio after the day's session, and sat in a corner beside his amp and baffle. Allman played slide guitar (which was not employed in previous attempts) and improvised the overdubbed performance, bringing all of the members to tears. [...] "It was unbelievable," [...] recalled Trucks. [...] "It was just magic. It’s <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> the greatest music we played was from out of nowhere, that it wasn’t practiced, planned, or discussed." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith {{was one of}} {{the loudest}} voices of white dissent against the new constitution. He opposed its {{splitting}} of the heretofore non-racial, qualified electorate into graduated [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] rolls, saying the proposed system had [...] "racialist" [...] connotations, and objected to the idea that the first black MPs would be elected on what he said would be a [...] "debased franchise". [...] "Our policy in the past has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> we would have a government, in Rhodesia, based on merit and that people wouldn't worry whether you were black or whether you were white," [...] he said. He also pointed out that the document did not actually guarantee Southern Rhodesian independence in the event of Federal dissolution. At the UFP vote on the constitution on 22 February 1961, Smith was the only member out of 280 to vote against it. Deeply disillusioned by these developments, he resigned from the UFP soon after to sit in the Federal Assembly as an independent. He lent his support to the [...] "United Group", an awkward coalition wherein Winston Field's conservative Dominion Party closed ranks with Sir Robert Tredgold and other liberals against the constitutional proposals, despite opposing them for totally contradictory reasons. The black nationalist leaders initially endorsed the constitution, signing the draft document, but almost immediately repudiated it and called for blacks to boycott elections held under it. A referendum of the mostly white electorate approved the new constitution by a majority of 65% on 26 July 1961.|$|E
500|$|Jam noted it was commonplace for Jackson to sing her vocals {{with the}} base track {{first and then}} {{have the rest of}} the song built around it in order to make her voice the center of the piece. [...] "Janet did all of her {{background}} vocals and not just the lead vocals. The idea with her has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> she does all of her own vocals, so that it's totally a Janet record." [...] On the title track [...] "Rhythm Nation", her vocals range from Bb3 to G5, climaxing within its middle eight. Musicologist Richard J. Ripani observed the album and title track showcased the variety of contemporary R styles, making [...] "use of elements across the R spectrum, including use of a sample loop , triplet swing, rapped vocal parts and blues notes (D naturals and G naturals)." [...] This style of music, known as new jack swing, was immensely popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Though officially credited to the production techniques of Teddy Riley, Ripani theorized Riley was influenced by Jackson's 1986 single [...] "Nasty", which also features a distinctive triplet swing. Jon Pareles observed the album's diversity catered {{to a wide variety of}} radio formats, including pop, quiet storm, Adult contemporary and mainstream rock. [...] "Black Cat" [...] was a stand-out for the record, not only for being composed exclusively by Jackson, but for its stark departure from her general style of music, delving into hard rock. While Jellybean Johnson was elected to produce it, Dave Berry was recruited to play guitar for the song. It was recorded using a mixture of Rockman and Marshall amplifier to give the song a heavy metal sound.|$|E

2500|$|When Michael Carroll {{wrote an}} e-book novella about Rico in 2014, {{he dealt with}} this issue in the story.

Why should he {{be the only one}} to have his first name on his badge? ... But Gordon’s story “Judgement” makes a plot-point of Rico temporarily wearing a “Dredd” badge in order to fool Judge Kenner into thinking that he is Joe … So I had to make a choice. In my re-telling of the relevant scenes from “Judgement” I omitted the part about the badge-swap. So far, no one has complained!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{important}} sociological {{aspect of}} tradition {{is the one}} that relates to rationality. It is also related to the works of Max Weber (see theories of rationality), and were popularized and redefined in 1992 by Raymond Boudon in his book Action. In this context tradition refers to the mode of thinking and action justified as [...] "it has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> way". This line of reasoning forms the basis of the logical flaw of the appeal to tradition (or argumentum ad antiquitatem), which takes the form [...] "this is right because we've always done it this way." [...] In most cases such an appeal can be refuted {{on the grounds that the}} [...] "tradition" [...] being advocated may no longer be desirable, or, indeed, may never have been despite its previous popularity.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} days of the home school movement, Dr. Cynthia Bower taught phonics classes to groups of home school mothers in the summer, and the school began {{providing}} the service of annual achievement testing. The school’s philosophical stand has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> parents are primarily responsible for the education of their own children. Believing this, CHA developed programs to equip parents to teach and to give them educational support. Out of this was born the Home School Satellite Program. The emphasis of the program has always been on preparation of the parent to teach, but there have been opportunities for students to participate in some school events and/or classes. Many of these students have found their way into the CHA day school program because of this association.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} said that they cannot fathom my motive. For the full period of my active life I have been a teacher of {{economics}} to the working classes, and my contention has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> capitalism is rotten to its foundations, and must give place to a new society. I had a lecture, the principal heading of which was [...] "Thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not kill", and I pointed out that {{as a consequence of the}} robbery that goes on in all civilised countries today, our respective countries have had to keep armies, and that inevitably our armies must clash together. On that and on other grounds, I consider capitalism the most infamous, bloody and evil system that mankind has ever witnessed. My language is regarded as extravagant language, but the events of the past four years have proved my contention.|$|E

2500|$|Clemens {{has been}} {{the focal point of}} several controversies. His {{reputation}} has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> of a pitcher unafraid to throw close to batters. Clemens led his league in hit batsmen only once, in , but he has been among the leaders in several other seasons. This tendency was more pronounced during his earlier career and subsequently tapered off. Still, Clemens' reputation precedes him. After the 2000 ALCS game against the Mariners where he knocked down future teammate Alex Rodriguez and then argued with him, Seattle Mariners manager Lou Piniella called Clemens a [...] "headhunter." [...] His beaning earlier that year of Mike Piazza, followed by his notorious broken-bat throw at Piazza in the 2000 World Series, cemented Clemens' surly, unapologetic image in the minds of many. In 2009, former manager Cito Gaston publicly denounced Clemens as a [...] "double-talker" [...] and [...] "a complete asshole". Clemens was ranked 9th all-time in hit batsmen after the 2007 season.|$|E
2500|$|The Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement, agreed {{by the new}} {{government}} following the 2010 general election aimed to give MPs a free vote [...] "to express its view" [...] on repealing the Hunting Act 2004 when parliamentary time allowed, possibly in 'early 2012'. The prime minister explained in January 2012 [...] "I always thought the hunting ban was a pretty bizarre piece of legislation ... I {{think there should be}} a free vote in the House of Commons. I think the Commons should make its mind up about this. My problem has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> it was just taking the criminal law into an area of activity where it didn’t really belong." [...] However, in December 2012 Owen Paterson, the Environment Secretary, said that there was no immediate likelihood of winning a Commons vote to make hunting legal again and that supporters of hunting would need to do [...] "more work" [...] to win over sceptical MPs.|$|E
2500|$|At 11:47pm on {{the night}} of 30 March, {{ambulance}} services were called to a park in Lismore, in the far north of New South Wales. They found Solon next to an open drain in the park, suffering from head injuries. She also had difficulty moving her legs. She had most likely sustained these injuries after falling into the drain, although some media reports speculated that she had been in a car accident. To this day she claims she was knocked off a pushbike by a passing car, but the medical view has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> she was physically assaulted [...] She was taken to Lismore Base Hospital, where she was treated for her injuries. She was soon moved to the psychiatric ward because she was behaving aggressively towards hospital staff, presumably due to her head injuries. A social worker Guing Coop who visited Solon at the hospital identified that she was of Filipino background, and suspected that she was an illegal immigrant. On this basis the social worker contacted the local branch of the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.|$|E
