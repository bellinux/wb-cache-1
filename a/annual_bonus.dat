5|$|Where the Prime Minister's {{remuneration}} was concerned, the Committee {{recommended that}} it be pegged to twice of a MR4-grade minister's salary and doing away with the fixed service bonus. Instead, the Prime Minister will receive a larger national bonus. His <b>annual</b> <b>bonus</b> where the targets for the indicators have been met will be six months' salary, and 12 months' salary {{where they have been}} greatly exceeded. This will lead to a reduction in the Prime Minister's annual salary of 28% to $2.2 million (about US$1.7 million). Lee Hsien Loong said that he accepted the Committee's recommendations. He remains the best-paid head of government in the world, his proposed annual pay package exceeding that of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Donald Tsang, the political leader with the second-highest salary in the world (around US$550,000), by about three times; and that of the President of the United States Barack Obama (US$400,000) by over four times.|$|E

25|$|Finally, every Partner {{receives}} an <b>annual</b> <b>bonus,</b> {{which is a}} share of the profit. It is calculated as a percentage of salary, with the same percentage for everyone, from top management down to the shop floor and storage rooms. The bonus is dependent on the profitability of the Partnership each year, varying between 6% and 20% of the Partners' annual salaries since 2000.|$|E
50|$|The {{insurance}} company has some freedom {{to decide what}} mix of bonuses to pay. An {{insurance company}} may decide to pay low <b>annual</b> <b>bonuses</b> and a high terminal bonus. Such a policy will protect the insurance company from falls in the investment markets because <b>annual</b> <b>bonuses</b> cannot be taken away once given. However, this policy might be unattractive to investors {{because it does not}} contain many guarantees and offers a low rate of return (until the maturity of the policy).|$|R

500|$|The Committee's {{report was}} {{discussed}} in Parliament from 16 to 18 January 2012. Setting out {{the position of}} the Workers' Party, Chen Show Mao said that the basic monthly salary of an MP should be $11,000, the pay of an MX9-grade director in the Management Executive Scheme of the Civil Service. A minister should be paid five times this sum ($55,000), and the Prime Minister nine times ($99,000). NCMP Gerald Giam said that ministers should obtain an average <b>annual</b> <b>bonus</b> of three months of their base salaries, and in any case no more than five months' bonus. Two-thirds of the bonus should be made up of the national bonus, and the remaining third based on the individual's performance, which should be determined according to key performance indicators fixed for each ministry {{at the start of a}} new government's term. Moreover, only a portion of bonuses should be paid at the end of each year. Payment of the remainder should be deferred till the end of the government's term. If the minister's performance is poor, some of the withheld bonus should be clawed back. The WP's proposal was criticized by a number of PAP MPs. Minister of State for Health Amy Khor expressed the view that [...] "olitical service is much more than public service. Civil servants are not subject to the votes of citizens nor do they need to carry the ground in policymaking. ... Pegging ministerial salaries to civil service salaries is not an adequate mechanism to account for the burdens and responsibilities that come with the job." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing in Fortune {{magazine}} in August 2015, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld described the hiring as [...] {{the result of}} [...] "a dysfunctional HP board committee, filled with its own poisoned politics, hired her with no CEO experience, nor interviews with the full board." [...] Fiorina received a larger signing offer than any of her predecessors, including: 65 million in restricted stock to compensate her for the Lucent stock and options she left behind, a 3 million signing bonus, a 1 million annual salary (plus a 1.25–3.75 million <b>annual</b> <b>bonus),</b> 36,000 in mortgage assistance, a relocation allowance, and permission (and encouragement) to use company planes for personal affairs.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1870s, {{the largest}} {{shareholders}} were business people from Saint Petersburg, including Vladimir Giuliani (665 shares or 14%) and Leon Rosenthal (600 shares or 12.5%), while local nobles Zubov and Plater only had 30 shares each. The ownership later shifted with local nobles becoming the majority shareholders. In 1905, [...] family owned 403 shares, Plater family owned 714 shares, Protasewicz family owned 330. The bank was {{governed by a}} 5-member board elected for three years. The initial five members included four founders, namely Giuliani, Zubov, Wittgenstein, and Mikhailovsky. Up to 1915, about 20 people served on the board. The longest serving {{members of the board}} were Adam Plater (32 years; chairman in 1898–1908), Józef Montwiłł (27 years), Nikolay Zubov (26 years; chairman in 1872–1898), and Paweł Piotr Kończa (26 years; chairman in 1909/1910–1915). In addition to salary and dividends, board members received an <b>annual</b> <b>bonus</b> which averaged 11,881 rubles in 1892–1902. The number of employees grew from 45 in 1885 to 131 in 1915.They received annual salary increases and bonuses. Among the employees were several prominent Lithuanian politicians and activists, including Antanas Smetona, Mykolas Biržiška, and Jurgis Šaulys.|$|E

40|$|We {{test the}} extent to which <b>annual</b> <b>bonuses</b> paid to CEOs are {{excessive}} using an earnings-transformed barrier call model, in which following Murphy (2001) bonuses are paid for above-target performance and not otherwise. We extract the ex ante portion of realized CEO cash pay which enables us to identify irregularities, including pay capture, excessive bonuses and retention bonuses while controlling for increments to long-term pay and the introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 2002. Our main empirical result is that excessive <b>annual</b> <b>bonuses</b> are found associated primarily with positive free cash flow. Other major findings are that talented CEOs have the best of both worlds: they are allowed to capture the pay process when good luck obtains yet retention bonuses are paid when bad luck obtains. Finally, we add to the evidence that SOX is at risk of dysfunctionallity given that passage of SOX is associated with shifts in pay sensitivity from contingent to non-contingent modes. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} stock versus option compensation for CEOs in 69 U. S. publicly-traded firms identified as financially distressed but which recovered during 1992 to 2009. Financially-distressed firms are those having negative industry-adjusted ROA for four consecutive years and not selling {{significant amounts of}} debt for any three consecutive years inside this window. The control group is a matched sample of non-financially distressed firms. Our results indicate a preference for option compensation in the initial years of distress rather than grants of restricted stock because equity is not priced as an option in recovering firms. Grants of restricted stock in tandem with <b>annual</b> <b>bonuses</b> are deferred {{until the beginning of}} recovery which is no earlier than the year following. Our findings are robust with respect to the market-to-book of assets, with option grants loading positively and <b>annual</b> <b>bonuses</b> loading negatively {{in the first year of}} financial distress. We conclude that shareholders tailor CEO compensation to changes in the asset mix as financial distress evolves into recovery...|$|R
