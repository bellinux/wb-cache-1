40|$|Some {{countries}} (e. g. the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand) {{have recently}} reviewed how they regulate the pricing of aeronautical services (landing <b>charges,</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>parking</b> <b>charges,</b> terminal facility charges etc.) at their principal airports. One major {{issue that has}} emerged from each of these reviews is whether it is preferable to adopt a single-till or dual-till approach to pricing aeronautical services. This thesis aims to analyse the potential loss of social welfare {{as a result of}} adopting the single-till approach and the dual-till approach under three airport pricing scenarios. A review of international experience of economic regulation of airports, as well as a qualitative discussion on {{the difference between the two}} approaches, has been undertaken. A mathematical model and a number of economic graphs have been constructed. The equations derived from the model show that the dual-till approach is desirable when aeronautical capacity is fully utilised or already over-utilised, while the single-till approach is preferable where there is excess capacity. London Heathrow Airport is taken as the subject of the case study. The results illustrate that the dual-till price was higher than the single-till price by 12 % in 2001102, while the market-clearing price was higher than the single-till price by 75 %. The differences between the two approaches are: (i) the potential loss of social welfare is less under the dual till than under the single till by 1. 64 % of aeronautical social welfare for the summer season, and 1. 34 % for the winter season; (ii) the excess demand is less by 3. 0 % of capacity; (iii) the average number of passengers per flight is increased by three; (iv) the profits for Heathrow Airport increase from £ 5. 38 to £ 6. 05 per passenger; and (v) the airlines' cost is higher by £ 0. 67 per passenger, and airfares will be increased by up to £ 0. 67. These estimates can be significantly affected by the level of average cost of aeronautical services (which is the dual-till price) and the airlines' valuation on slots (which influences the slope of the demand curve for aeronautical services) ...|$|R
