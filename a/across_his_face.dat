5|$|The camera shows {{shots of}} young women, and passes through arcades and cinemas in Leicester Square. The camera now passes South Africa House showing protestors in the Non-Stop Picket, an anti-apartheid vigil. The video cuts to a closeup of Tennant singing the chorus, with a purple neon sign eerily passing <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> At {{the end the}} camera passes again through Leicester Square, where people queue to see Fletch and Desperately Seeking Susan. The video was {{nominated}} for Best New Artist in a Video at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to a-ha's Take On Me.|$|E
25|$|At work, Peter {{discovers that}} Sydney's {{billboard}} advertising campaign was successful. Feeling encouraged, Peter finally {{stands up to}} his insufferable colleague, Tevin Downey (Rob Huebel), who had been badgering Peter for half the selling rights to the lucrative Ferrigno property. When Tevin makes one final attempt {{to get a piece}} of the Ferrigno listing, Peter slaps him <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and tells him to stay away from it.|$|E
25|$|Nader partook {{in these}} efforts from a dangerously close range, once having the brains and blood {{of one of}} his bodyguards {{splatter}} <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> as a cannonball fired from a Turkish gun decapitated him in a most grotesque manner. The Russians also sent some support in that they dispatched an engineer as well as a few siege guns although these did very little in progressing the battle.|$|E
60|$|Bill {{looked at}} me in surprise, and I thought I {{observed}} a sad expression pass <b>across</b> <b>his</b> sunburned <b>face.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He hesitated, and a flush crept <b>across</b> <b>his</b> brown <b>face.</b> <b>His</b> eyes wavered. [...] "Well, you see, the {{old home}} was mortgaged--and mother was sick--" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{asked me}} what I read, and when I had told him, a thin smile fluttered <b>across</b> <b>his</b> white <b>face.</b>|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, Cherry {{is forced}} to dance by the first soldier held at gunpoint. Eventually, she breaks her wooden leg <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and stabs him in his eye with it. Dakota, after realizing her hands have regained feeling, quick-draws her syringe {{launcher}} and stuns the second soldier. El Wray and Abby arrive to rescue Cherry and Dakota, and El Wray replaces Cherry's broken wooden leg with a modified M4 Carbine with an M203. She promptly kills the first soldier and several zombies with it.|$|E
500|$|Archaeological {{findings}} in the late 20th century {{shed light on the}} final moments of the battle. In 1996 workmen at a construction site in the town of Towton uncovered a mass grave, which archaeologists believed to contain the remains of men who were slain during or after the battle in 1461. The bodies showed severe injuries to their upper torsos; arms and skulls were cracked or shattered. [...] One exhumed specimen, known as Towton 25, had the front of his skull bisected: a weapon had slashed <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> cutting a deep wound that split the bone. The skull was also pierced by another deep wound, a horizontal cut from a blade across the back.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{begins with}} an MRI of a head with {{an image of the}} boxed [...] "H" [...] from the logo (the international symbol for hospital) in the foreground. This is then overlaid with an image of Dr. House's face taken from the pilot episode with the show's full title appearing <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> House's head then fades and the show's title is underlined and has the [...] "M.D." [...] appear next to it, producing the entire logo of the show. This was {{the full extent of the}} title sequence in the pilot episode. All subsequent episodes contain a longer sequence including the names of the six featured cast members and creator David Shore. Laurie's name appears first, followed by the names of the five other featured cast members in alphabetical order (Edelstein, Epps, Leonard, Morrison, and Spencer, then Shore).|$|E
6000|$|She {{had never}} before seen him give such signs of feeling. <b>Across</b> <b>his</b> ghastly <b>face</b> the long moustaches flamed in the shade. He spoke suddenly: ...|$|R
60|$|There was a {{fluttering}} sigh {{of relief}} from Miss Armytage. Then silence followed, in which O'Moy stared at Tremayne, emotion after emotion sweeping <b>across</b> <b>his</b> mobile <b>face.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Fire," [...] said Wingenund, and {{it seemed}} that as he spoke a sterner shadow flitted <b>across</b> <b>his</b> bronzed <b>face.</b> [...] "The sun sets to-night over the ashes of the Village of Peace." ...|$|R
500|$|Johnson's health soon {{improved}} {{and he was}} put to wet-nurse with Joan Marklew. Some time later, he contracted scrofula, known {{at the time as}} the [...] "King's Evil" [...] because it was thought royalty could cure it. Sir John Floyer, former physician to King Charles II, recommended that the young Johnson should receive the [...] "royal touch", which he received from Queen Anne on 30 March 1712. He was gifted a gold [...] "touch piece" [...] that he wore as an amulet {{for the rest of his}} life. However, the ritual was ineffective, and an operation was performed that left him with permanent scars <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and body. With the birth of Johnson's brother, Nathaniel, a few months later, Michael became unable to pay the debts he had accrued over the years, and his family was no longer able to maintain its standard of living.|$|E
500|$|Johnson's health {{improved}} {{and he was}} placed in the nursing care of Joan Marklew. During this period he contracted what {{is believed to have been}} scrofula, known at that time as the [...] "King's Evil". Sir John Floyer, a former physician to King Charles II, recommended that the young Johnson should receive the [...] "royal touch", which he received from Queen Anne on 30 March 1712 at St James's Palace. Johnson was given a ribbon in memory of the event, which he claimed to have worn for the rest of his life. However, the ritual was ineffective and an operation was performed that left him with permanent scarring <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and body. Sarah later gave birth to a second boy, Nathaniel. Having two children put financial strain on the family; Michael was unable to keep on top of the debts he had accumulated over the years, and his family was no longer able to maintain the lifestyle it had previously enjoyed.|$|E
500|$|The {{transfer}} of Audaciouss broadside to Spartiate meant that Captain Maurice-Julien Emeriau now faced three opponents. Within minutes {{all three of}} his ship's masts had fallen, but the battle around Spartiate continued until 21:00, when the badly wounded Emeriau ordered his colours struck. Although Spartiate was outnumbered, it had been supported by the next in line, Aquilon, which was the only ship of the French van squadron fighting a single opponent, Minotaur. Captain Antoine René Thévenard used the spring on his anchor cable to angle his broadside into a raking position across the bow of Nelson's flagship, which consequently suffered more than 100 casualties, including the admiral. At approximately 20:30, an iron splinter fired in a langrage shot from Spartiate struck Nelson over his blinded right eye. The wound caused a flap of skin to fall <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> rendering him temporarily completely blind. Nelson collapsed {{into the arms of}} Captain Edward Berry and was carried below. Certain that his wound was fatal, he cried out [...] "I am killed, remember me to my wife", and called for his chaplain, Stephen Comyn. The wound was immediately inspected by Vanguards surgeon Michael Jefferson, who informed the admiral that it was a simple flesh wound and stitched the skin together. Nelson subsequently ignored Jefferson's instructions to remain inactive, returning to the quarterdeck shortly before the explosion on Orient to oversee the closing stages of the battle. Although Thévenard's manoeuvre was successful, it placed his own bow under Minotaurs guns and by 21:25 the French ship was dismasted and battered, Captain Thévenard killed and his junior officers forced to surrender. With his opponent defeated, Captain Thomas Louis then took Minotaur south to join the attack on Franklin.|$|E
6000|$|I {{tried to}} put on a cheerful aspect for my guide. But it was too soon. Attalano, wise old fellow, {{understood}} my case. A smile, warm and living, flashed <b>across</b> <b>his</b> dark <b>face</b> as he spoke: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wind-of-Death is a {{great white}} chief. His gun is always loaded," [...] he said calmly, and a look of pride gleamed <b>across</b> <b>his</b> dark <b>face,</b> as though he gloried in the wound made by such a warrior.|$|R
60|$|Da Souza leaned <b>across</b> the table. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> was livid, and {{the corners}} of his eyes were bloodshot.|$|R
500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E
2500|$|NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray {{called the}} album [...] "oddly unsatisfying, {{considerably}} less {{than the sum of}} the parts", while Bowie encyclopedist Nicholas Pegg describes it as [...] "one of the most urgent, compelling and essential" [...] of his releases. The Rolling Stone review by Ben Gerson pronounced it [...] "less manic than The Man Who Sold The World, and less intimate than Hunky Dory, with none of its attacks of self-doubt." [...] The album cover featuring a lightning bolt <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> is regarded as one of Bowie's most iconic images.|$|E

6000|$|... "Him skate," [...] sneered {{the other}} {{squirting}} a jet of blinding steam {{in the face}} of the client he was treating, [...] "he ain't got no more go in him than dat rag,"--and he slapped a wet towel <b>across</b> <b>his</b> client's <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|Once more Wingrave {{called him}} back. He was leaning a little forward <b>across</b> the table. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> was very set and cold.|$|R
2500|$|Memorials to Bowie {{were created}} {{around the world}} in the hours {{following}} his death. In Brixton, the London area in which Bowie was born, a mural painted in 2013 by Australian artist Jimmy C became a shrine at which fans left flowers, records and handwritten messages. The mural features Bowie as he appeared on his iconic Aladdin Sane album cover, with a lightning flash <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> In Berlin, fans left flowers outside the flat in which Bowie and Iggy Pop had lived while Bowie created his seminal [...] "Berlin trilogy" [...] of albums—Low, Heroes and Lodger—in the late 1970s as well as Pop's albums The Idiot and Lust for Life (which Bowie produced). Flowers were also left outside Bowie’s New York City apartment and next to his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles. In Milan, fans held a flash mob memorial service in Colonne di San Lorenzo while fans in Rio de Janeiro paid tribute to Bowie in February's Rio Carnival. In Japan, hours after Bowie's death, a devoted fan was arrested for threatening to commit suicide with a box cutter in public.|$|E
2500|$|Both Mexican and U.S. {{authorities}} {{suspected that}} Kilroy's disappearance {{was some sort}} of foul play. They speculated that Kilroy could have been a victim of drug-related violence or of robbery-killing, but they were short on leads to make any firm conclusions. When Kilroy's friends reported the disappearance, Customs agents went with them to Matamoros to help retrace their steps. Texan officials contacted the U.S. consulate in Matamoros and asked investigators to carry out a search with Kilroy's description in Matamoros jails and hospitals. Investigators then hired a hypnotist {{to see if he could}} figure out some clues. Under hypnosis, Bradley stated that he saw a young Hispanic man wearing a blue plaid shirt and with a visible scar <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> talking to Kilroy before he disappeared. He recalled that the man walked up to Kilroy and told him, [...] "Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?" [...] though Bill said he was not sure if Kilroy responded back. However, none of the friends were able to precisely recall the exact moment or place where Kilroy disappeared. Investigators deduced by this story that Kilroy was kidnapped for robbery or ransom. The first option seemed the most likely because his abductors had not called for a payment. They believed that Kilroy's body was probably dumped in a remote location. Helicopters and terrain vehicles of the United States Border Patrol were called to look on the Rio Grande River, but his body was not found.|$|E

60|$|At length Ibrahim roused {{himself from}} his {{momentary}} stupor. He stepped deliberately <b>across</b> the body, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> inflamed, and stood to beard the impassive dalal.|$|R
6000|$|He drew <b>his</b> {{right hand}} <b>across</b> <b>his</b> {{bleeding}} <b>face,</b> {{and held it}} up to heaven as he uttered these words, which he spoke very loud, and then added more faintly, [...] "How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge the blood of thy saints!" ...|$|R
