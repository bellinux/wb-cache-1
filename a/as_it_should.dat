5|$|Much like had {{occurred}} at the final podium celebrations for the 2009 Tour de France, the wrong national anthem was played for Contador. Race organizers mistakenly played an old Spanish anthem with lyrics favored by former Spanish dictator Francisco Franco.

5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and red were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>should.</b> In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E
5|$|A rocket-ship {{carrying}} astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) launches and orbits the Earth, {{marking the}} United States' first manned space launch. Shortly after taking off, {{the ship is}} struck by an unknown object, forcing Corcoran to abort the mission and land. However, the equipment cannot handle the fast descent back into the atmosphere and the ship crash lands in the woods, killing Corcoran. Dave Randall (Ed Nelson) and Donna Bixby (Georgianna Carter), two technicians from a nearby space agency tracking station, locate the crashed ship and recover Corcoran's body. They are baffled, however, by {{what appears to be}} a giant tear in the side of the destroyed spacecraft and a mud-like substance covering some of the wreckage. Randall and Bixby are joined by lead scientist Dr. Alex Wyman (Tyler McVey), technician Steve Dunlap (John Baer) and physician Julie Benson (Angela Greene), who was also Corcoran's fiancee. Wyman observes that Corcoran's body exhibits no signs of rigor mortis, and that the blood pooling beside him is not livid <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be. The team brings the corpse back to their lab to run tests and find further irregularities. Although the body lacks a heartbeat or pulse, it maintains the blood pressure of a living human being. After looking at his blood in a microscope, they find unusual, unidentifiable cells that seem resistant to destruction from human white blood cells.|$|E

5|$|Fire {{is another}} {{important}} element in {{the maintenance of the}} Everglades. The majority are caused by lightning strikes from thunderstorms during the wet season. Their effects are largely superficial, and serve to foster further plant growth: sawgrass will burn above water, but the roots are preserved. Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees, and releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than decomposition. Large burned areas also affect waterflow, since wind and water are undeterred by the eradicated sawgrass; water may flow two to three times faster in recently burned areas. During the wet season only dead plant matter and the tips of plants are burned; however, the effects of fire are much more significant in the dry season, as fire may be fed by organic peat and burn deeply, destroying root systems. The only impediment to the spread of fire in the Everglades is the presence of water. It takes around 225years for one foot (0.3m) of peat to develop, but the peat is not as dense <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be for the 5,000years of the Everglades' existence. Scientists point to fire as the reason.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March 1936, {{the pianist}} John Tobin gave a {{performance}} of Pars prima from Opus clavicembalisticum. This performance was highly inadequate, as it lasted twice as long <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> have. Sorabji left before it finished, and later denied having attended it. He gave his last public performance of his music on 16 December 1936 in Glasgow, when he premiered his Piano Toccata No. 2, and afterwards withdrew from the concert platform {{for the rest of}} his life. He later banned unauthorised performances of his music, but it remains unclear when he did so; Paul Rapoport has argued that it was probably in 1938 or 1939, but Sorabji's first announcement of it dates from 1944. Although the ban was not legally enforceable, Sorabji presented it so sharply and decisively that, for the most part, he achieved his aim. The shift in Sorabji's attitude to public performances of his music has generally been ascribed to Tobin's performance, but this explanation has also been described as simplistic. Apart from misleading reviews of his works by music critics, the deaths of people who were important to him (Busoni, Warlock, and Bernard van Dieren), the silence of Sibelius, the changes in Szymanowski's style, and the increasing prominence of Stravinsky and the late Schoenberg have all been put forward as catalysts for his decision to isolate himself from the world of music. The financial implications of his father's death have also been cited as an important factor.|$|E
5|$|The defence was {{supported}} by a strong artillery component that included 41 Breda Model 35 20mm antiaircraft guns; 85 47mm antitank guns; 26 Solothurn S-18/1000 anti-tank rifles; 41 Cannone da 65/17 modello 13 65mm infantry support guns; 147 Cannone da 75/32 modello 37 75mm and 77mm field guns; 76 Skoda 100 mm Model 1916 and Canon de 105 mle 1913 Schneider 105mm guns; and 27 120mm and Obice da 149/12 modello 14 149mm medium howitzers. The large number of different gun models, many of them quite old, created difficulties with the supply of spare parts. The older guns often had worn barrels, which caused problems with accuracy. Ammunition stocks were similarly old and perhaps as many as two-thirds of the fuses were out of date, resulting in excessive numbers of dud rounds. There were also multiple models of machine guns, with seven different types of ammunition in use. The Breda 30, the principal light machine gun, had a low rate of fire and a reputation for jamming. The Fiat-Revelli Modello 1914 was a bulky and complicated weapon that was also prone to stoppages. Some of these had been rebuilt as Fiat-Revelli Modello 1935s which, while an improvement, were still unreliable. The principal medium machine gun, the Breda M37, had its shortcomings, the main one being that it used 20-round strips of cartridges, which gave it a reduced rate of fire. Shortages of raw materials, coupled with the increased technological sophistication of modern weapons, led to production problems that frustrated efforts to supply the entire Italian Army with the best available equipment. The result was that the firepower of the Italian defenders was neither as great nor as effective <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> have been.|$|E

25|$|Whangamarino Wetland {{has been}} subject to {{intensive}} biodiversity management, research, and community awareness campaigns by the Department of Conservation {{as part of the}} Arawai Kākāriki wetland restoration programme. Conservation measures taken to maintain or improve biodiversity include controlling weeds, particularly grey willow, aquatic grasses, yellow flag iris, alligator weed and gorse, and mammalian pests, including mustelids, rodents, cats and possum. The Whangamarino weir was repaired in 2010 and is now operating <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> to help maintain minimum summer water levels in the wetland. Fencing to exclude stock from wetland areas and restoration plantings have also taken place. Monitoring of Australasian bittern/matuku and other cryptic wetland birds including spotless crake/pūweto, marsh crake/koitareke, and fernbird/mātātā is regularly carried out, as is monitoring of black mudfish/waikaka and threatened plants such as Anzybas carseii and Lycopodium serpentinum. The Auckland/Waikato Fish and Game Council have also implemented a number of projects to enhance wetland habitat in the Whangamarino for gamebirds. Research carried out to date includes studies on sediment sources and accumulation rates, ecohydrology and peat oscillation, water quality, vegetation monitoring and monitoring of mammalian predators.|$|E
