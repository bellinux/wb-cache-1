5000|$|Single {{strength}} {{orange juice}} (SSOJ) {{can either be}} [...] "not from concentrate" [...] (NFC) orange juice or juice that is reconstituted from a concentrate {{with the addition of}} water to reach a specific single strength brix level. The processing of SSOJ also begins with the selection of orange. The most common types of orange used to produce orange juice are the Pineapple orange, Valencia orange, and Washington Navel oranges from Florida and California. The manufacturing journey begins when oranges are delivered to processing plants by trucks holding about 35,000 to 40,000 pounds of fruit. The fruit is unloaded at the plant for inspection and grading to remove unsuitable fruit before the oranges enter the storage bins. An <b>automatic</b> <b>sampler</b> contraption removes oranges for determination of acid and soluble solids. The bins are organized based on ratio of soluble solids to acids in order to blend oranges appropriate to produce juice with uniform flavor. After the fruit leaves the bins, they are scrubbed with detergent on a rotary brush washer and subsequently rinsed with potable water. Throughout the processing stages, there are multiple points with facilities that inspect oranges and discard damaged fruit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Climbers on {{the summit}} of Mt. Everest are exposed to extreme hypoxia, and the {{physiological}} implications are of great interest. Inferences have been made from alveolar gas samples collected {{on the summit}}, but arterial blood samples would give critical information. We propose a plan to insert an arterial catheter {{at an altitude of}} 8000 m, take blood samples above this using an <b>automatic</b> <b>sampler,</b> store the samples in glass syringes in an ice-water slurry, and analyze them lower on the mountain 4 to 6 hours later. Results A preliminary design of the <b>automatic</b> <b>sampler</b> was successfully tested at the White Mountain Research Station (altitude 3800 m – 4300 m). To determine how much the blood gases changed over a long period, rabbit blood was tonometered to give a gas composition close to that expected on the summit (PO 2 4. 0 kPa (30 mmHg), PCO 2 1. 3 kPa (10 mmHg), pH 7. 7) and the blood gases were measured every 2 hours for 8 hours both at sea level and 3800 m. The mean changes were PO 2 + 0. 3 to + 0. 4 kPa (+ 2 to + 3 mmHg), PCO 2 0 to + 0. 13 kPa (+ 1 mmHg), pH - 0. 02 to - 0. 04, base excess - 0. 7 to - 1. 2 mM. In practice the delay before analysis should not exceed 4 to 6 hours. The small paradoxical rise in PO 2 is presumably caused mainly by contamination of the blood with air. Conclusion We conclude that automatic arterial blood sampling at high altitude is technically feasible and that the changes in the blood gases {{over a period of several}} hours are acceptably small. </p...|$|E
