5|$|In {{addition}} to the house, which has a full basement, the museum uses a separate building as a gallery. That building, the Northwest Gallery, was formerly used for storage and as a shop, but looks similar to the Rice House. This gallery focuses on items from Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, and includes collections of <b>agates,</b> thundereggs, zeolites, and placer gold, among others.|$|E
5|$|Richard L. Rice married Helen Hart in 1932 and {{the couple}} began rock {{collecting}} in 1938 after finding <b>agates</b> along the Oregon Coast. In 1952 the Rices built a new home north of Hillsboro on 30 acres (12.1 ha) that would later house the museum. The Rices founded a museum in 1953 to display their collections. Their collections won them the Woodruff Trophy twice (1958 and 1961) and this award was permanently awarded to Richard and Helen in 1961. Helen {{served as president of}} the American Federation of Mineralogical Societies from 1959 to 1960.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the Black Stone has been much debated. It has been {{described}} variously as basalt stone, an agate, a piece of natural glass or—most popularly—a stony meteorite. , the curator of the Austro-Hungarian imperial collection of minerals, published the first comprehensive analysis of the Black Stone in 1857 in which he favoured a meteoritic origin for the Stone. Robert Dietz and John McHone proposed in 1974 that the Black Stone was actually an agate, judging from its physical attributes and a report by an Arab geologist that the Stone contained clearly discernible diffusion banding characteristic of <b>agates.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Other {{forms of}} <b>agate</b> include Holley blue <b>agate</b> (also spelled [...] "Holly blue agate"), a rare dark blue ribbon <b>agate</b> only found near Holley, Oregon; Lake Superior agate; {{carnelian}} <b>agate</b> (has reddish hues); Botswana agate; plume agate; condor <b>agate,</b> tube <b>agate</b> (with visible flow channels or pinhole-sized [...] "tubes"); fortification <b>agate</b> (with contrasting concentric banding reminiscent of defensive ditches and walls around ancient forts); fire <b>agate</b> (showing internal flash or [...] "fire", {{the result of}} a layer of clear <b>agate</b> over a layer of hydrothermally deposited hematite); and Patuxent River stone, a red and yellow form of <b>agate</b> only found in Maryland, where it is the state gem.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Agate</b> Point is a {{community}} of Bainbridge Island, Washington. It is located north of State Highway 305 and is identifiable by many street names containing [...] "Agate" [...] (Agatewood Road, <b>Agate</b> Pass Road, <b>Agate</b> Point Road, and <b>Agate</b> Street). <b>Agate</b> Point is the northernmost point on Bainbridge Island.|$|R
50|$|In 1841, <b>Agate</b> Passage near Bainbridge Island, Washington {{was named}} by Lt. Charles Wilkes {{in honor of}} <b>Agate.</b> <b>Agate</b> Island in Fiji was also {{named in honor of}} <b>Agate.</b> Botanist Asa Gray used <b>Agate's</b> {{drawings}} and the expedition's specimens for botanical reports, and named a violet, Agatea violaris, after him.|$|R
25|$|During {{the ensuing}} ice ages a lobe of glacial ice, the Superior lobe, moved into Minnesota through the agate-filled Superior trough. The glacier picked up surface <b>agates</b> and transported them south. Its {{crushing}} action and cycle of freezing and thawing {{at its base}} also freed many <b>agates</b> from within the lava flows and transported them, too. The advancing glacier acted like an enormous rock tumbler, abrading, fracturing, and rough-polishing the <b>agates.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{lava flows}} formed the {{conditions}} for creation of Lake Superior <b>agates.</b> As the lava solidified, water vapor and carbon dioxide trapped within the solidified flows formed a vesicular texture (literally millions of small bubbles). Later, groundwater transported ferric iron, silica, and other dissolved minerals passed through the trapped gas vesicles. These quartz-rich groundwater solutions deposited concentric bands of fine-grained quartz called chalcedony, or embedded <b>agates.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{appealing}} reasons for naming the Lake Superior agate as the Minnesota state gemstone is its general availability. Glacial activity spread <b>agates</b> throughout northeastern and central Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, Northern Iowa, and Michigan's Upper Peninsula in the United States and the area around Thunder Bay in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. Lake Superior <b>agates</b> {{have been found in}} gravel deposits along the Mississippi River basin. Other types of agate similar to Lake Superior agate have been found in southwestern Wisconsin.|$|E
5000|$|Moss <b>agate</b> {{contains}} green filament-like inclusions, {{giving it}} the superficial appearance of moss or blue cheese. There is also tree <b>agate</b> {{which is similar to}} moss <b>agate</b> except it is solid white with green filaments whereas moss <b>agate</b> usually has a transparent background, so the [...] "moss" [...] appears in 3D. It is not a true form of <b>agate,</b> as it lacks <b>agate's</b> defining feature of concentric banding.|$|R

25|$|Pseudofossils are visual {{patterns}} in rocks that {{are produced by}} geologic processes rather than biologic processes. They can easily be mistaken for real fossils. Some pseudofossils, such as dendrites, are formed by naturally occurring fissures in the rock that get filled up by percolating minerals. Other types of pseudofossils are kidney ore (round shapes in iron ore) and moss <b>agates,</b> which look like moss or plant leaves. Concretions, spherical or ovoid-shaped nodules found in some sedimentary strata, were {{once thought to be}} dinosaur eggs, and are often mistaken for fossils as well.|$|E
25|$|Ševo (שְׁבוֹ = in the masoretic text) / Achates (in the Septuagint) - Achates {{definitely}} {{refers to}} agate, and Ševo may be cognate with the Assyrian term Subu, meaning agate. <b>Agates</b> were common in Egypt and Assyria, and {{were regarded as}} a potent talismans. Isidore of Seville lists the agate as being among the black gems. The Midrash Rabba (Numbers 2:7) appears to argue for the jewel in question having been a grey variety. Conversely, in Rabbi Saadia Gaon’s (882-942 CE) Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch, {{as well as in}} the medieval Samaritan Arabic translation, the stone is rendered as سبج , meaning, obsidian.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gemstone}} {{comes in}} various sizes. The gas pockets {{in which the}} <b>agates</b> formed were primarily small, about 1cm in diameter. A few Lake Superior <b>agates</b> have been found that are 22cm in diameter [...] with a mass exceeding 10 kilograms. Very large <b>agates</b> are extremely rare.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lava flows}} formed the {{conditions}} {{for the creation of}} Lake Superior <b>agates.</b> As the lava solidified, gas trapped within the flows formed an amygdaloidal texture (literally, rock filled with small vesicles). Later, groundwater transported dissolved minerals through the vesicles depositing concentric bands of fine-grained quartz called chalcedony. [...] The color scheme is caused by the concentration of iron present in the groundwater at the time that each new layer was being deposited. [...] The process went on until the cavity had been completely filled. Over time erosion freed the <b>agates</b> from the solidified lava, which is not as hard as quartz.|$|E

2500|$|Crane Mountain is a fault-block {{geologic}} structure typical of southeast Oregon's basin and range country. [...] The primary rock {{that makes up}} the mountain is basalt. [...] The mountain has a west-facing fault scarp with a steep cliff face overlooking the Goose Lake Valley. [...] The mountain's fault-block displacement tilts layers of basalt upward to expose the underlying John Day rhyolite tuff formation on the western flank of the mountain. [...] <b>Agates</b> and thunder eggs {{are found in the}} rhyolite layers. [...] Small amounts of gold bearing quartz are also found on the southern slope of the mountain. [...] This is very unusual for an area dominated by basalt. [...] The soils around the mountain are typical of the area. [...] They are derived primarily from broken-down basalt and tuffaceous materials.|$|E

The concentrations of other elements in the <b>agate</b> samples are several parts per million levels. The quantitative maps of the colorful <b>agate</b> sample have shown that Fe was mainly distributed in the inner half, but Al, Cu, and Mn in the outer half. In particular, Fe and Mn were primarily concentrated as small spots. On the other hand, the oscillatory zoning patterns are apparent in the quantitative maps of the blue <b>agate</b> sample, showing a correlative relationship between Al and Ti but an antithetic relationship between Al and Fe.
