5|$|The {{success of}} South Park {{prompted}} more cable companies to carry Comedy Central and led {{it to its}} {{becoming one of the}} fastest-growing cable channels. The number of households that had Comedy Central jumped from 9.1 million in 1997 to 50 million in June 1998. When the show debuted, the most Comedy Central had earned for a 30-second commercial was US$7,500. Within a year, advertisers were paying an average of US$40,000 for 30 seconds of <b>advertising</b> <b>time</b> during airings of South Park in its second season, while some paid as much as US$80,000.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 under {{chairman}} Tom Wheeler, the FCC {{began to}} increase its scrutiny {{regarding the use of}} such agreements—particularly joint sales—to evade its policies. On March 31, 2014, the commission voted to make joint sales agreements count as ownership if the senior partner sells 15% or more of <b>advertising</b> <b>time</b> for its partner, and to ban coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the top four stations in a market. Wheeler indicated that he planned to address local marketing and shared services agreements in the future. The change in stance also prompted changes to then-proposed acquisitions by Gray Television and Sinclair Broadcast Group, who, rather than use sharing agreements to control them, moved their existing programming and network affiliations to digital subchannels of existing company-owned stations in the market, and then relinquished control over them by selling the stations to minority-owned broadcasters intending to operate them independently.|$|E
5|$|On March 6, 2014, the FCC {{announced}} that it would hold a vote on March 31 on a proposal to ban joint sales agreements involving television stations outright, making them attributable to FCC ownership limits if the senior partner sells 15% or more of <b>advertising</b> <b>time</b> of a competing junior partner station in the JSA; the ban applies to both existing sharing agreements under such a structure as well as pending station transactions that include a JSA. Station owners would be given a two-year grace period to unwind or modify joint sales agreements in violation of the policy; coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market would also be barred under the proposal. Wheeler also proposed an expedited process to review joint sales agreements on a case-by-case basis, granting a waiver of the rules if a broadcaster can prove a particular joint sales agreement arrangement serves the public interest.|$|E

5|$|Viewership {{increased}} exponentially {{from the}} 1960s {{until the end}} of the century. This was due to the use of satellites to broadcast live television worldwide in 1964, and the introduction of colour television in 1968. Global audience estimates for the 1968 Mexico City Games was 600million, whereas at the Los Angeles Games of 1984, the audience numbers had increased to 900million; that number swelled to 3.5billion by the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. However, at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, NBC drew the lowest ratings for any Summer or Winter Olympics since 1968. This was attributed to two factors: one was the increased competition from cable channels, the second was the internet, which was able to display results and video in real time. Television companies were still relying on tape-delayed content, which was becoming outdated in the information era. A drop in ratings meant that television studios had to give away free <b>advertising</b> <b>time.</b> With such high costs charged to broadcast the Games, the added pressure of the internet, and increased competition from cable, the television lobby demanded concessions from the IOC to boost ratings. The IOC responded by making a number of changes to the Olympic program. At the Summer Games, the gymnastics competition was expanded from seven to nine nights, and a Champions Gala was added to draw greater interest. The IOC also expanded the swimming and diving programs, both popular sports with a broad base of television viewers. Finally, the American television lobby, namely NBC, was able to dictate when certain events were held so that they could be broadcast live during prime time in the United States. The results of these efforts were mixed: ratings for the 2006 Winter Games were significantly lower than those for the 2002 Games, while there was a sharp increase in viewership for the 2008 Summer Olympics, and the 2012 Summer Games became the most watched event in US television history.|$|E
25|$|At {{the halfway}} point of each innings, a seven-and-a-half-minute {{television}} timeout was now held. The change proved controversial, as critics and players felt that it broke {{the flow of the}} game, and because two-thirds of the break were devoted purely to additional <b>advertising</b> <b>time.</b> The timeout rules were revised for the 2010 season.|$|E

25|$|Paley quickly {{grasped the}} {{earnings}} potential {{of radio and}} recognized that good programming {{was the key to}} selling <b>advertising</b> <b>time</b> and, in turn, bringing in profits to the network and to affiliate owners. Before Paley, most businessmen viewed stations as stand-alone local outlets or, in other words, as the broadcast equivalent of local newspapers. Individual stations originally bought programming from the network and, thus, were considered the network's clients.|$|E
25|$|XEG-AM: In 1950 the <b>advertising</b> <b>time</b> of {{this station}} {{came under the}} control of Harold Schwartz of Chicago, who also came to {{represent}} XERB near Tijuana/Rosarito (the station made famous in the movie American Graffiti.) From the late 1960s through the early 1980s, XEG was known for its nighttime Black/R/Disco music programming block, transcribed from KGFJ, Los Angeles. XEG ran a huge 150kW signal at night, with 50kW daytime, on 1050 kHz.|$|E

25|$|Under the CBC's current {{arrangement}} with Rogers Communications for National Hockey League broadcast rights, Hockey Night in Canada broadcasts on CBC-owned stations and affiliates are not technically aired over the CBC Television network, but over a separate CRTC-licensed part-time network operated by Rogers.

25|$|Structurally, the Australian {{television}} industry was closely modelled on the two-tiered system {{that had been}} in place in Australian radio since the late 1930s. One tier consisted of a network of publicly funded television stations run by the ABC, which was funded by government budget allocation and (until 1972) by fees from television viewer licences. The second tier consisted of the commercial networks and independent stations owned by private operators, whose income came from selling <b>advertising</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{frequent}} {{complaint is}} {{with regard to}} its transportation.

25|$|The TNT {{business}} {{model is a}} television network, its main source of income is advertisement. The TV signal passes through a system of the TNT’s regional TV stations {{as well as to}} the company’s regional partners. Those, in turn, get part of the <b>advertising</b> <b>time</b> within the framework of the content provided by the TNT. The TNT channel delivers its signal via a number of satellites staying in four different orbits, which allows its 27 television stations and more than 350 TNT’s subdivisions to get it in the corresponding time zones. The TNT signal is then received and further redistributed by the local network stations broadcasting to most of the big cities as well as 5,900 smaller communities of the Russian Federation.|$|E
25|$|Paley changed broadcasting's {{business}} model {{not only by}} developing successful and lucrative broadcast programming but also by viewing the advertisers (sponsors) as the most significant element of the broadcasting equation. Paley provided network programming to affiliate stations at a nominal cost, thereby ensuring the widest possible distribution for both the programming and the advertising. The advertisers then became the network's primary clients and, because of the wider distribution brought by the growing network, Paley was able to charge more for the ad time. Affiliates were required to carry programming offered by the network {{for part of the}} broadcast day, receiving a portion of the network's fees from advertising revenue. At other times in the broadcast day, affiliates were free to offer local programming and sell <b>advertising</b> <b>time</b> locally.|$|E
25|$|CBC's {{games are}} no longer {{produced}} by CBC Sports and Rogers sells all advertising during the telecasts, but CBC is still provided with <b>advertising</b> <b>time</b> for its own programming. While CBC did not pay a rights fee to either Rogers or the NHL, the public broadcaster does not receive any revenue from the telecasts, aside from payments by Rogers for its use of certain CBC personalities and ancillary staff, and its rent of studio space. In order to assign responsibility for {{the content of the}} telecasts, compliance with regulatory guidelines, and advertising to Rogers, its NHL telecasts on CBC are legally considered to be broadcast by a part-time television network owned by the Sportsnet subsidiary, which is affiliated with CBC's English-language television stations. A license for this arrangement was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in April 2015.|$|E

25|$|Aiming to keep classic radio {{alive as}} {{television}} matured, and to challenge CBS's Sunday night radio lineup, which featured {{much of the}} programs and talent that had moved to that network following the defection of Jack Benny to CBS, NBC launched The Big Show in November 1950. This 90-minute variety show updated radio's earliest musical variety style with sophisticated comedy and dramatic presentations. Featuring stage legend Tallulah Bankhead as hostess, it lured prestigious entertainers, including Fred Allen, Groucho Marx, Lauritz Melchior, Ethel Barrymore, Louis Armstrong, Ethel Merman, Bob Hope, Danny Thomas, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Ella Fitzgerald. However, The Big Shows initial success did not last despite critical praise, as most of its potential listeners were increasingly becoming television viewers. The show lasted two years, with NBC losing around $1 million on the project (the network was only able to sell <b>advertising</b> <b>time</b> during the middle half-hour of the program each week).|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks before}} the election, the Orr {{campaign}} discovered that Dresner Sykes, their media-consulting firm, had charged the campaign for television <b>advertising</b> <b>time</b> that was never purchased. [...] A World-Herald analysis after the election determined that Creative Media, the firm's advertising placement agency, had charged the campaign $34,860 for October advertising on Omaha station KMTV, while actually purchasing $6,115 worth of time, or 17.5% of that ordered. [...] A similar pattern obtained on other stations in Omaha, Lincoln, North Platte, and Sioux City, with Creative Media actually purchasing between 12% and 88% of the time ordered by the campaign. [...] Although the campaign had ordered advertisements placed on Omaha television stations every day during the period October 5–22, nothing ran on at least four days of the period. [...] Dresner Sykes reimbursed the Orr campaign with a $50,000 check and with the cancellation of unpaid bills; but Orr could not recover the lost <b>advertising</b> <b>time</b> in the past, {{and found that the}} most desirable advertising times {{for the rest of the}} campaign's duration were already taken.|$|E
500|$|When the TV rights reverted back to Warner Bros. in 1985, CBS aired {{the film}} {{one last time}} on network {{television}} in its theatrical version. When the movie entered the syndication market in 1988 (following a play-out run on pay cable) TV stations were offered the extended cut or the theatrical cut. The stations that showed the extended cut edited the second half to add more <b>advertising</b> <b>time</b> and [...] "previously on..." [...] cutback scenes just as ABC had done in 1982.|$|E
