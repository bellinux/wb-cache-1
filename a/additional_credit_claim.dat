40|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>claims</b> (or bank loans) {{represent}} {{a large share}} of the collateral accepted by the Eurosystem in its credit operations in recent years. Hence the techniques and procedures used in the use of <b>credit</b> <b>claims</b> as collateral have become significant elements of the monetary policy implementation mechanism in the euro area. The procedures involved in <b>credit</b> <b>claim</b> collateralisation, however, are generally more complex than those for marketable assets traded in regulated markets or in other markets accepted by the Eurosystem. While several types of <b>credit</b> <b>claims</b> are eligible as Eurosystem collateral, each type of <b>credit</b> <b>claim</b> has different characteristics which require specific considerations in the eligibility assessment. This paper provides an overview of the issues involved in the use of <b>credit</b> <b>claims</b> as collateral and relates these to some measures taken by both the public and the private sector aimed at facilitating their use in the euro area. The paper also elaborates on the syndicated loan market in the euro area as this market is sizeable, while it appears that the use of such loans as collateral remains limited...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of a “single list” of eligible collateral common to all Eurosystem credit operations on January 1, 2007, replaced the two-tier framework in place until then. Euro area <b>credit</b> <b>claims</b> (i. e. bank loans) have become eligible for use as collateral under the single list, provided they fulfill conditions specified by the ECB. Even though <b>credit</b> <b>claims</b> are more complex than marketable securities in legal as well as administrative terms, their mobilization by Austrian banks as collateral in credit operations with the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) has surged {{since the beginning of}} 2007. Moreover, the conditions for the cross-border use of <b>credit</b> <b>claims</b> have been adapted for the new single framework; these procedures and euro area enlargement upon Slovenia’s accession lead to the expectation that the cross-border use of <b>credit</b> <b>claims</b> by OeNB counterparties in credit operations with the OeNB will increase. <b>credit</b> <b>claims,</b> single list, assignment for security purposes. ...|$|R
40|$|F or 2002, {{corporations}} {{filing a}} U. S. tax return claimed $ 42. 4 billion in foreign tax credits. The foreign tax credit enabled these corporations {{to reduce their}} U.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between federal program recipients and interest groups. It is argued here that interest groups attempt to <b>claim</b> <b>credit</b> for federal program benefits. <b>Claiming</b> <b>credit</b> efforts are the activities interest group leaders engage in {{that are designed to}} call attention to the group and generate program recipient support of the group. More directly, <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> for program benefits is offered as another means for an interest group to solve its collective action problem. Here, instead of interest group leaders having to produce and provide selective benefits, they are expected to take advantage of their involvement with particular federal programs to resolve their maintenance problems. It is further argued that effective <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> must have affective, evaluative, and behavioral impacts on program recipients. The <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> model is explored at both the macro-level and micro-levels. Interest group leaders were surveyed to determine whether they engaged in <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> for particular programs. Recipients of these same programs were also surveyed in order to determine their relationship with the groups that speak on behalf of their program(s). Key determinants of {{the relationship between}} interest groups and program recipients are found to be: the nature of the federal program benefit (particularistic versus collective); the presence of other interest groups; and the <b>credit</b> <b>claiming</b> activities of the interest group...|$|R
