5|$|Continuing to {{gradually}} intensify, Greta attained hurricane status on November4 and {{later that day}} it attained Category 2 status on the modern day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. After reaching this intensity, the hurricane turned northeastward and accelerated, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not intensify further. A reconnaissance mission around this time recorded a minimum pressure of 970mbar (hPa; 28.64inHg).|$|E

5|$|Since Manila {{is prone}} to earthquakes, the Spanish colonial architects invented the style called Earthquake Baroque which the churches and {{government}} buildings during the Spanish colonial period adopted. As a result, succeeding earthquakes of the 18th and 19th centuries barely affected Manila, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> periodically level the surrounding area. Modern buildings in and around Manila are designed or have been retrofitted to withstand an 8.2 magnitude quake in accordance to the country's building code.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} prompted {{standard precautions}} in the Bahamas and Florida, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> {{not affect the}} region. In North Carolina, winds and waves brushed the coast, while around New York City, heavy rainfall caused some flooding. Along Cape Cod and Nantucket, Able produced winds up to 55mph (90km/h) and high waves, and across New England there were nine traffic fatalities. The hurricane killed 2people in Canada and caused over $1million in damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{published}} novels, neither commercially successful, {{were his}} two final efforts in this genre: Cashel Byron's Profession written in 1882–83, and An Unsocial Socialist, begun and finished in 1883. The latter was published as a serial in ToDay magazine in 1884, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> {{not appear in}} book form until 1887. Cashel Byron appeared in magazine and book form in 1886.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> {{not sell}} enough copies {{to reach the}} {{mainstream}} music charts, the album was well received with positive reviews and recognition. Thornton's lyrics and Nakamura's production were highly praised, as was DJ Qbert's innovative scratching. Dr. Octagonecologyst has since been ranked {{as one of the}} best hip hop albums of the 1990s. The character of Dr. Octagon has appeared in multiple works by Thornton, including First Come, First Served (1999) and Dr. Dooom 2 (2008), both of which contain tracks in which Octagon is murdered by Dr. Dooom.|$|E

5|$|During the Sarajevo Crisis in 1914, German diplomats offered Turkey an anti-Russian {{alliance}} and territorial gains in Caucasia, north-west Iran and Trans-Caspia. The pro-British faction {{in the cabinet}} was isolated due to the British ambassador taking leave until 18 August. As the crisis deepened in Europe, Ottoman policy was to obtain a guarantee of territorial integrity and potential advantages, unaware that the British might enter a European war. On 30 July 1914, {{two days after the}} outbreak of the war in Europe, the Ottoman leaders agreed to form a secret Ottoman-German Alliance against Russia, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not require them to undertake military action.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Bush {{established}} Arbusto Energy, a small {{oil exploration}} company, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not begin operations {{until the following}} year. He later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman. The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc., with Bush becoming a member of HKN's board of directors. Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush {{had at the time}} of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.|$|E
5|$|In February 1916, Wilson enlisted as {{a private}} in the Maryland National Guard and was posted to Company H, 5th Maryland Infantry. This unit was called to active duty at Laurel, Maryland in June 1916 for service on the Mexican border. It was based at Eagle Pass, Texas, and, like most National Guard units, {{supported}} but did not directly participate in the Pancho Villa Expedition, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> occasionally cross the border into Mexico. Wilson was soon promoted to corporal, and later sergeant. The 5th Maryland Regiment returned to Maryland in February 1917.|$|E

5|$|In January 1531, Campeggio was {{dismissed}} as cardinal protector, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not become public knowledge until May. At {{first it was}} unclear whether Henry VIII intended to appoint a successor, with Giovanni Domenico de Cupis emerging as an active candidate in March 1532. The king favoured Alessandro Farnese (future Pope Paul III), and instructed his ambassadors on 21 March to offer it to Farnese, and then de Cupis or Giovanni del Monte (future Pope Julius III) in the event that Farnese declined or was not approved.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} why this {{hurricane}} went unnamed, {{even though it}} clearly met the criteria for doing so. Any statement about why is purely speculative at this point. The hurricane is the furthest north a tropical cyclone existed in the Eastern Pacific, and is also the northernmost existence for a Pacific hurricane. It was the only tropical cyclone {{to exist in the}} central Pacific this year. No damage or casualties were reported, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> hassle a few ships.|$|E
5|$|Larger boats {{entering}} Padstow {{were offered}} assistance, generally by pilots who would wait at Stepper Point when a ship signalled {{it would be}} entering. If a boat was foundering, salvors would step in and help. There were cases where salvors attempted to overstate the danger in court, so as to extort more money from the owners. This happened to the brig The Towan, which foundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger. <b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner.|$|E

Calculating in all expenses, Deadline.com estimated that the film made a profit of $42.7 million, for Warner Bros. The film earned $116.6 million on its opening weekend, including $17.5 million from IMAX theaters. Man of Steel earned an additional $111 million from DVD and Blu-ray sales.|$|E
5|$|On 11 July 2011, Neptune {{completed}} its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not appear at its exact discovery {{position in the}} sky, because Earth was in a different location in its 365.26-day orbit.

5|$|Some of the Ticonderoga cannons, {{which were}} of a size and range not {{previously}} available to the Americans, were emplaced in fortifications around the city, and {{on the night of}} March 2, the Americans began to bombard the city with those cannon, to which the British responded with cannonades of their own. The American guns, under the direction of Colonel Knox, continued to exchange fire with the British until March 4.
