5|$|St. Augustine (354430) {{believed}} that the determinism of astrology conflicted with the Christian doctrines of man's free will and responsibility, and God not being the cause of evil, but he also grounded his opposition philosophically, citing the failure of astrology to explain twins who behave differently although conceived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>moment</b> and born at approximately the same time.|$|E

5|$|At 08:45 Rivoli, {{which had}} been {{struggling}} to reach the harbour of Trieste, lost her mizzenmast under fire from both Victorious and Weasel. Nearly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>moment,</b> two of her 36-pounder long guns exploded, killing or wounding 60 men, greatly disorganising and demoralising the others, and forcing Barré to transfer gunners from the upper gun deck to man his lower battery. Fifteen minutes later, with his ship unmanageable and battered, Commodore Barré surrendered. Rivoli had suffered over 400 killed and wounded from her crew of over 800, who had only assembled {{for the first time}} a few days before and had never sailed their ship in open water. Losses aboard Victorious were also heavy, with one officer and 25 sailors and marines killed and six officers (including Captain Talbot) and 93 men wounded.|$|E
5|$|In tone clusters, {{the notes}} are sounded fully and in unison, {{distinguishing}} them from ornamented figures involving acciaccaturas and the like. Their effect {{also tends to}} be different: where ornamentation is used {{to draw attention to}} the harmony or the relationship between harmony and melody, tone clusters are for the most part employed as independent sounds. While, by definition, the notes that form a cluster must sound at the same time, there is no requirement that they must all begin sounding <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>moment.</b> For example, in R. Murray Schafer's choral Epitaph for Moonlight (1968), a tone cluster is constructed by dividing each choir section (soprano/alto/tenor/bass) into four parts. Each of the sixteen parts enters separately, humming a note one semitone lower than the note hummed by the previous part, until all sixteen are contributing to the cluster.|$|E
5|$|Seeking to transmute {{the whole}} country, Father {{transports}} the Elrics to his base {{to use them}} as {{two of the five}} sacrifices required to achieve his goal. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>moment,</b> Alphonse finds his original body, but refuses to recover it because its weakened state would not help them to fight the homunculi. In the final fight against Father, Alphonse requests help from the alchemist May Chang to return Edward's right arm in exchange for Alphonse's soul. As Edward, with his restored arm, fights Father, Alphonse's soul disappears from the armor. Following Father's defeat, Edward sacrifices his ability to use alchemy to restore Alphonse's soul and original body. The two return to Resembool, where they live until they decide to separate to study alchemy. Alphonse joins with two chimera comrades and they travel to the country of Xing to learn more alchemy with May's help.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the rockets}} are {{constructed}} {{exactly the same}} way, and starting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>moment</b> in S with the same acceleration, they must have the same velocity {{all of the time}} in S. Thus they are traveling the same distances in S, so their mutual distance cannot change in this frame. Otherwise, if the distance were to contract in S, then this would imply different velocities of the rockets in this frame as well, which contradicts the initial assumption of equal construction and acceleration.|$|E

25|$|The {{basis of}} {{effective}} clicker training is precise timing {{to deliver the}} conditioned reinforcer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>moment</b> as the desired behaviour is offered. The clicker {{is used as a}} 'bridge' between the marking of the behaviour and the rewarding with a primary reinforcer such as a treat or a toy. The behaviour can be elicited by 'luring' where a hand gesture or a treat is used to coax the dog to sit, for example; or by 'shaping' where increasingly closer approximations to the desired behaviour are reinforced; and by 'capturing' where the dog's spontaneous offering of the behaviour is rewarded. Once a behaviour is learnt and is on cue (command), the clicker and the treats are faded out.|$|E
