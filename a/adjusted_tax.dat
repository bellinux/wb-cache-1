40|$|How {{to measure}} tax burden in an internationally {{comparable}} way? 1 In this {{paper we address}} the issue of tax burden and its measurement, beginning with a discussion of use of tax-to-GDP ratio for this purpose. We show that this commonly used indicator has a number of flaws, related to the methodology of calculation of taxes and GDP in national accounts. Firstly, tax revenue calculated in accordance with ESA 95 methodology is not perfectly in line with the economic concept of taxes, i. e. levies imposed by the government, which are compulsory and unrequited. Secondly, both tax revenue and GDP include a government component, which distorts the true picture of tax burden. Taxes paid on government expenditure do not affect incentives and do not constitute a ‘burden ’ on economic activity. We propose a number of adjustments to deal with these problems and apply them to data for Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The results indicate that in these countries, the underlying (methodologically and cyclically <b>adjusted)</b> <b>tax</b> burden imposed on economic activity has followed different trends from those implied by the headline tax-to-GDP ratios.

40|$|The {{major goal}} {{in this thesis}} is to explore the {{potential}} impact of an unemployment account system on individuals' employment incentives. This thesis consists of three parts. In the first part (Chapter 2) we identify the extent of the intrapersonal income redistribution, which is inherent in the German tax-benefit system. Disentangling the income redistribution in this way shows that the extent of intrapersonal income redistribution in Germany is indeed very high. In particular, unemployment benefits exhibit a large share of redistribution that occurs within the life cycle of the individuals. In the second part (Chapter 3) we investigate whether replacing the traditional German unemployment insurance system by unemployment accounts will improve employment incentives and thereby also the overall unemployment rate. We employ a stochastic life-cycle framework to study how the trade-off between labor market incentives, consumption and savings is affected under a system of unemployment accounts. In Chapter 4 we stress the role of the financial perspective and determine the optimal tax rate both in the long-run and during a transition period. In {{the first part of this}} chapter we implement a pay-as-you-go structure in the unemployment account system with a balanced government budget and identify the optimal long-run tax rate. Moreover, we investigate how the employment incentives and the unemployment rate behave in the long-run and how they react to the <b>adjusted</b> <b>tax</b> rate, which prevails in the long-run. In the second part of this chapter we identify the optimal tax rate during the transition period when switching from the UI system to the UA system...|$|E

40|$|The Canterbury {{earthquakes}} of 2010 and 2011 have shone {{the spotlight}} {{on a number of}} tax issues. These issues, and in particular lessons learned from them, will be relevant for revenue authorities, policymakers and taxpayers alike in the broader context of natural disasters. Issues considered by this paper include the tax treatment of insurance monies. For example, building owners will receive pay-outs for destroyed assets and buildings which have been depreciated. Where the insurance payment is more than the <b>adjusted</b> <b>tax</b> value, there will be a taxable "gain on sale" (or depreciation recovery income). If the building owner uses those insurance proceeds to purchase a replacement asset, legislative amendments specifically enacted following the earthquakes provide that rollover relief of the depreciation recovery income is available. The tax treatment of expenditure to seismically strengthen a building is another significant issue faced by building owners. Case law has determined that this expenditure will usually be capital expenditure. In the past such costs could be capitalised to the building and depreciated accordingly. However, since the 2011 - 2012 income year owners have been prohibited from claiming depreciation on buildings and therefore currently no deduction is available for such strengthening expenditure (whether immediate or deferred). This has significant potential implications for landlords throughout New Zealand facing significant seismic retrofit costs. Incentives, or some form of financial support, whether delivered through the tax system or some other mechanism may be required. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) require insurance proceeds, including reimbursement for expenditure of a capital nature, be reported as income while expenditure itself is not recorded as a current period expense. This has the effect of overstating current income and creating a larger variation between reported income for accounting and taxation purposes. Businesses have obligations to maintain certain business records for tax purposes. Reconstructing records destroyed by a natural disaster depends on how the information was originally stored. The earthquakes have demonstrated the benefits of ‘off-site’ (outside Canterbury) storage, in particular electronic storage. This paper considers these issues and the Inland Revenue Department (Inland Revenue) Standard Practice Statement which deals with inter alia retention of business records in electronic format and offshore record storage. Employer provided accommodation is treated as income to the benefitting employee. A recent amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 retrospectively provides that certain employer provided accommodation is exempt from tax.
