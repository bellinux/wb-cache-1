5|$|Capital {{punishment}} is legal in Singapore. The number of judicial executions has fluctuated widely depending on crime rates; {{at its highest}} point, according to unofficial statistics compiled by Amnesty International, about 408 people were hanged between 1991 and 2003; at its lowest point in 2010, none were executed. Between 2004 and 2011, the number of executions varied between none and 10.

5|$|Capital {{within the}} EU may be {{transferred}} in any amount {{from one country}} to another. All intra-EU transfers in euro are treated as domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs. This includes all member states of the EU, even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions <b>are</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in euro. Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions; however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a clearing system, TARGET, for large euro transactions.|$|E
5|$|Design {{management}} {{is not a}} standard model that can be projected onto every enterprise, nor is there a specific way of applying it that leads to guaranteed success. Design management processes <b>are</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> by humans with different responsibilities and backgrounds, who work in different industries and enterprises with different sizes and traditions, whilst having different target groups and markets to serve. Design {{management is}} multifaceted, {{and so are the}} different applications of and views on design management.

5|$|During {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, electrons {{are transferred}} from electron donors to electron acceptors such as oxygen, in redox reactions. These redox reactions release energy, {{which is used}} to form ATP. In eukaryotes, these redox reactions <b>are</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> by a series of protein complexes within the inner membrane of the cell's mitochondria, whereas, in prokaryotes, these proteins are located in the cells' intermembrane space. These linked sets of proteins are called electron transport chains. In eukaryotes, five main protein complexes are involved, whereas in prokaryotes many different enzymes are present, using a variety of electron donors and acceptors.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids {{are made}} by fatty acid synthases that {{polymerize}} and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups: in animals and fungi, all these fatty acid synthase reactions <b>are</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> by a single multifunctional type I protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each step in the pathway.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore {{primary schools}} at lower levels, lessons {{relating}} to the national anthem and the singing of the national anthem <b>are</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> {{as part of the}} civics and moral education programme. The national anthem is sung in all mainstream schools and armed forces camps at ceremonies held at the beginning and/or the end of each day, during which the national flag is also raised and lowered and the Singapore National Pledge is taken. Both the anthem and the national pledge must not be used for commercial situations.|$|E

5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{is a type}} of computation {{in which}} many calculations or the execution of processes <b>are</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.|$|E
5|$|Royal Tunbridge Wells is policed by Kent Police, and in May 2000 {{the main}} police station {{for the area}} moved from Royal Tunbridge Wells to a new {{building}} in Tonbridge and operations at the Royal Tunbridge Wells station, in Crescent Road, were scaled back so that it now operates as an administrative centre.
