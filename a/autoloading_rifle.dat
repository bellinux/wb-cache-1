5000|$|Developed in 1923 in the United States, it was {{intended}} to replace the [...]30-06 Springfield in new semi-automatic rifles and machine guns. When first recommended for adoption, M1 Garand rifles were chambered for the [...]276 Pedersen, which held ten rounds in its unique en-bloc clips. The [...]276 Pedersen was a shorter, lighter and lower pressure round than the [...]30-06, which made the design of an <b>autoloading</b> <b>rifle</b> easier than the long, powerful [...]30-06. The U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Douglas MacArthur rejected the [...]276 Pedersen Garand in 1932 after verifying that a [...]30-06 version was feasible.|$|E

"French <b>autoloading</b> <b>rifles.</b> 1898-1979 (Proud promise), by Jean Huon ,1995,Collector Grade Publications[...]This volume ( [...] in English [...] )contains a {{detailed}} technical chapter describing the Lebel rifle and its ammunition.

50|$|John Pedersen {{designed}} or {{was instrumental}} in the design of many firearms for the Remington Arms Company. He had worked in concert with John Browning to design the Remington Model 17 which served {{as the basis for the}} Remington Model 31, Ithaca 37, Browning BPS, and Mossberg 500. He designed the Pedersen device that converted the M1903 Springfield into an autoloading intermediate-caliber longarm. Pedersen later worked for the US Army and provided competition to John Garand building an <b>autoloading</b> <b>rifle</b> to fire a full-power rifle cartridge. His design used innovative wax lubricated cases and a toggle-bolt system much like that of the Luger pistol but eventually lost out to the M1 Garand.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the failure}} to adopt either the [...]276 Pedersen or later [...]280 British, {{the concept of an}} {{intermediate}} power military cartridge of a 6.5 to 7mm diameter was far from dead. Shortly after the 7.62mm NATO cartridge was adopted, Armalite submitted their AR-10 for evaluation, the U.S. Army suggested they redesign the gun to fire a [...]256 caliber projectile. Although this suggestion was fruitless, the Army later engaged in many studies of a 6mm SAW cartridge. They, once again, sought to replace <b>autoloading</b> <b>rifle</b> and machine gun cartridges with one round. Current studies are focused on the 6.8mm Remington SPC and 6.5mm Grendel commercial cartridges although their purpose is to improve on the 5.56×45mm cartridge, not to develop a replacement for the 7.62×51mm NATO as well.|$|E
5000|$|Immediately after World War II, British {{designers}} {{introduced a}} series of intermediate-power 7mm cartridges {{for a different reason}} than Pedersen. They sought an answer to the Germans' highly successful 7.92mm Kurz and various studies on the matter. The U.S. stuck with [...]30 caliber mostly out of a desire to have a common cartridge between rifle and machine gun combined with the perceived necessity for effectiveness out to 2,000 yards. Development of a shorter [...]30 round specifically for use in an <b>autoloading</b> <b>rifle</b> began after the war, and resulted in the 7.62×51mm NATO, a shorter and slightly lighter round that gave nearly identical ballistics to the [...]30-06. Interestingly, the British studies on various cartridges culminated in the [...]280 British cartridge, which shared ballistic similarities to the [...]276 Pedersen in caliber, bullet weight and velocity.|$|E
2500|$|All Mini-14 type rifles are {{available}} in stainless steel or blued finish with hardwood, synthetic, or laminated stocks with [...] or [...] barrels. Most Mini-14s have a classic sporter appearance in contrast to comparable <b>autoloading</b> <b>rifles</b> such as the AK-47 and AR-15. However, Ruger now offers some Mini-14 rifles in a black ATI-brand adjustable folding stock with a pistol grip. Also, Ruger factory-made 5-, 10-, 20- and 30-round steel magazines are readily available along with numerous aftermarket options.|$|R

5000|$|Testing in {{the early}} 1920s led the Ordnance Bureau to {{identify}} three rifle designs - the Bang rifle, the Thompson Autorifle, and the primer-protrusion actuated Garand Model 1919 rifle - as promising candidates. However, all three designs were burdened with the high pressure and heat generating characteristics of the [...]30-06 ammunition, which looked {{likely to result in}} a weapon too heavy and too subject to overheating to be worthwhile. Trials with a small number of [...] "militarized" [...]25 Remington <b>autoloading</b> <b>rifles,</b> despite their unsuitability for combat, provided a body of practical experience with semiautomatic rifles and an appreciation for the idea less powerful ammunition might be a critical part of the successful development of such weapons.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of its introduction, the [...]276 Pedersen was a {{solution}} to a significant problem. The U.S. Army wanted a general issue <b>autoloading</b> <b>rifle</b> that would fire the [...]30-06 cartridge, but such a rifle was prohibitively large with existing designs such as the Browning Automatic Rifle and French Chauchat. A weapon of the same weight as the M1903 needed to fire a smaller cartridge. Pedersen's cartridge was viewed as a compromise as it was underpowered compared to most military rifle cartridges. This decreased recoil energy made possible a reliable, lightweight semi-automatic rifle with existing technology. Despite overcoming these early semi-automatic problems, the Garand was chosen because it did not require the use of lubricated cartridge cases for reliable function. The Garand was originally going to be chambered in the [...]276 Pedersen, but the logistics of changing all of the infantry's guns (including machine guns) to a new round was judged cost-prohibitive, so the Garand was chambered in [...]30-06, removing the need for the new cartridge.|$|E
5000|$|On October 16, 1900, John Browning {{was granted}} [...] for the rifle, which he then sold to Remington. Outside the U.S., this rifle {{was made by}} Fabrique Nationale of Liege, Belgium, and marketed as the FN Browning 1900. Under an {{agreement}} between Remington and FN, the Model 8 would be sold in the US while the FN 1900 would be sold elsewhere. Despite having a larger market, the FN 1900 was sold predominately to hunters in and around Western Europe and Canada. Because of the new and yet unproven nature of the <b>autoloading</b> <b>rifle,</b> the FN model never experienced {{the same level of}} sales as the Model 8. Cameron Woodall of The Great Model 8, a website dedicated to the rifle, postulates that this was likely due to the difficulty convincing European hunters to spend money on an expensive rifle that few people had ever seen before. Due to lackluster sales, only 4,913 Model 1900s were ever produced compared to the over 80,000 Model 8s produced.|$|E
5000|$|The Remington Arms Model 241 Speedmaster, an <b>autoloading</b> rimfire <b>rifle,</b> was {{manufactured}} from 1935 to 1951 from a John Browning design. Remington {{reports that}} 107,345 rifles were manufactured in [...]22 Short or [...]22 Long Rifle.

5000|$|The M8 is {{armed with}} the XM35 <b>rifled</b> <b>autoloading</b> 105 mm cannon main gun with an M240 7.62 mm machine-gun mounted coaxially. The M35 has a rate of fire of {{approximately}} 12 rounds per minute, with a ready capacity of 21 rounds with 9 more in stowage. A Browning M2 [...]50 caliber heavy machine gun is mounted in a manually-operated pintle on the commander's hatch. Power is provided by a Detroit Diesel 6V-92TIA diesel developing 550 hp.|$|R
