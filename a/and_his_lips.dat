5|$|The Joker has {{undergone}} many revisions since his 1940 debut. The most common {{interpretation of the}} character {{is that he is}} disguised as the criminal Red Hood, and pursued by Batman. The Joker falls into a vat of chemicals which bleaches his skin, colors his hair green <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> red, and drives him insane. The reasons why the Joker was disguised as the Red Hood, and his identity before his transformation have changed over time.|$|E
5|$|In his {{comic book}} appearances, the Joker {{is portrayed as}} a {{criminal}} mastermind. Introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor, the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. As Batman's nemesis, the Joker {{has been part of}} the superhero's defining stories, including the murder of Jason Todd—the second Robin and Batman's ward—and the paralysis of one of Batman's allies, Barbara Gordon. The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances. The most common story involves him falling into a tank of chemical waste which bleaches his skin white, turns his hair green, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> bright red; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane. The antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance, the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary.|$|E
25|$|Strauss {{wrote the}} opera's libretto, {{in the process}} cutting almost half of Wilde's play, {{stripping}} it down and emphasizing its basic dramatic structure. The structural form of Strauss's libretto is highly patterned, notably {{in the use of}} symmetry and the hierarchical grouping of events, passages, and sections in threes. Examples of three-part structure include Salome's attempt to seduce Narraboth, in order to get him to let her see Jochanaan. She tries to seduce him three times, and he capitulates on the third. When Jochanaan is brought before Salome he issues three prophecies, after which Salome professes love for Jochanaan three times—love of his skin, his hair, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> the last of which results in Jochanaan cursing her. In the following scene Herod three times asks Salome to be with him—to drink, eat, and sit with him. She refuses each time. Later Herod asks her to dance for him, again three times. Twice she refuses, but the third time Herod swears to give her whatever she wants in return and she accepts. After she dances and says she wants Jochanaan's head on a platter, Herod, not wanting to execute the Prophet, makes three offers—an emerald, peacocks, and finally, desperately, the Veil of the Sanctuary of the Holy of Holies. Salome rejects all three offers, each time more stridently insisting on Jochanaan's head. Three-part groupings occur elsewhere on both larger and smaller levels.|$|E

6000|$|... "When {{the sheriff}} comes--" [...] said Tomlinson, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> trembled as he spoke. He {{had no other}} picture of arrest than that.|$|R
500|$|... was an {{impulsive}} young man. From rare {{photographs and}} {{the testimony of}} his contemporaries emerges [...] a figure of medium stature, with slightly drooped shoulders, thick brown hair, and a pale oval face. His eyebrows were dark, {{and one of them}} was almost always raised, giving his face an expression of intense irony. His eyes burned with constant passion, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> were full and sensuous. There was also something young and vulnerable in his smile. He smiled often, and his conversation was reputed to be brilliant.|$|E
500|$|Feature films made in {{the west}} during the war were subject to {{censorship}} and were not always realistic. One {{of the first to}} attempt to represent violence, and which was praised at the time for [...] "gritty realism", was Tay Garnett's Bataan (1943). The depiction actually remained stylised: Jeanine Basinger gives as an example the [...] "worst image for stark violence" [...] when a Japanese soldier beheads an American: the victim shows pain <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> freeze in a scream, yet no blood spurts and his head does not fall off. Basinger points out that while this is physically unrealistic, psychologically it may not have been. The wartime audience was, she points out, well aware of friends and relatives who had been killed or who had come home wounded.|$|E
500|$|From 2006, {{according}} to Rinder, executives undergoing [...] "group confessions" [...] {{were made to}} stand in big trash cans {{in the middle of}} the floor with signs around their necks on which various derogatory statements were written. Rinder described how it became [...] "relatively routine" [...] for people to be [...] "slapped, punched, kicked, pushed, shoved, thrown up against the wall" [...] in order to make them confess. He told the Tampa Bay Times that he and other people were made to continuously crawl around a conference room table with their trouser legs rolled up, getting kicked from behind if they stopped, which resulted in them suffering severely contused and abraded knees after days of such treatment. There was an escalation in the level of confessions demanded, such that they became [...] "more and more dramatic and over the top in order to be acceptable." [...] He described how one executive was made to sit under an air vent with the cooling system turned up high, while cold water was poured over his head. After an hour or so, he was [...] "shaking so uncontrollably <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> were so completely blue that he was incapable of talking". (The executive in question denied to the Tampa Bay Times that this incident had ever happened).|$|E

2500|$|The {{officials}} {{were unable to}} use their whistles after the opening kick-off. As referee Norm Schachter blew his metal whistle to signal the start of play, it froze to his lips. As he attempted to free the whistle from his lips, the skin ripped off <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> began to bleed. The conditions were so hostile that instead of forming a scab, the blood simply froze to his lip. For {{the rest of the}} game, the officials used voice commands and calls to end plays and officiate the game. At one point during the game, CBS announcer Frank Gifford said on air, [...] "I'm going to take a bite of my coffee." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{raised his}} eyebrows, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> curled in a {{malicious}} sneer.|$|E

60|$|The logs {{were found}} in the main cabin behind the canary cage; two of them, one kept by Trent, one by Goddedaal. Wicks looked first at one, then at the other, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> stuck out.|$|R

60|$|The old dandy, {{in whose}} intrepid spirit the death {{which he had}} {{believed}} imminent had occasioned no trembling, turned pale as La Boulaye ceased. His blue eyes were lifted almost timidly to the Deputy's face, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> quivered.|$|R
60|$|It {{was then}} that Johnson came hurrying to the bridge. One of his eyes was swollen and already darkening, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> was cut <b>and</b> bleeding. Without even the {{formality}} of a salute, he burst upon me, white with fury.|$|R
60|$|Don Pedro frowned <b>and</b> curled <b>his</b> <b>lip,</b> but {{the prince}} smiled <b>and</b> nodded <b>his</b> approbation.|$|R
