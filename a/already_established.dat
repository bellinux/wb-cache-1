5|$|Another {{topic is}} the {{relationship}} between brain structures and language acquisition. Research in first language acquisition has <b>already</b> <b>established</b> that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages (such as babbling), and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development, while other research investigates the physical changes (known as neuroplasticity) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition, when adults learn a new language.|$|E
5|$|Auguste {{made his}} debut for Notre Dame in a November 12, 2012 victory against Monmouth, {{contributing}} 4 points and 3 rebounds in 3 minutes. After two ankle sprains during pre-season practice, Auguste had difficulty {{breaking into the}} <b>already</b> <b>established</b> team. Finding himself behind Jack Cooley and Garrick Sherman in the rotation, he averaged 10.7 minutes per game in 25 games.|$|E
50|$|While some student questioners {{feel the}} need to ask if the speaker yields, this is {{unnecessary}} under procedure, because the standing rules of the organizations and tournaments provide specific parameters for questioning periods that <b>already</b> <b>establish</b> when questioning begins.|$|R
50|$|He {{was elected}} a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in 1815 {{and set up}} in {{business}} for himself, working until 1818 at his father's Blackfriars premises. His elder brother James was <b>already</b> <b>establishing</b> his own reputation for navigational instruments.|$|R
50|$|After <b>already</b> <b>establishing</b> {{his place}} in the {{starting}} lineup, Gaćinović helped Vojvodina win the 2013-14 Serbian Cup in the club's centennial year. He was named the team's captain in early 2015, eventually becoming their top league scorer in the 2014-15 season, netting 11 goals.|$|R
5|$|Before Fowles {{published}} The French Lieutenant's Woman in 1969, he had <b>already</b> <b>established</b> {{his literary}} reputation with his novels The Collector (1963) and The Magus (1965). While writing The French Lieutenant's Woman, {{he was working}} on the screenplay for the film adaptation of The Magus. Moreover, The Collector had already been adapted in a 1965 film that gained Fowles further popular attention.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{communities}} were <b>already</b> <b>established</b> in Greece since the 13th century (Athens, Cyclades, Chios, Crete). Jewish communities also {{existed in the}} country, those arriving after the Expulsion of the Jews from Spain (1492) joining the earlier Romaniotes, Jews who had been living there since the times of Apostle Paul. Muslim families were still living in Greece during Otto's reign, since hostility was mainly against the Ottoman state and its depressive mechanisms and not against Muslim people.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{following}} a suggestion to Eastbourne Borough Council by Eastbourne Civic Society (now Eastbourne Society), a joint project {{was set up}} to erect blue plaques on buildings associated with famous people. The principles for selection are broadly those <b>already</b> <b>established</b> by English Heritage for such plaques in London. The first was erected in November 1994 in Milnthorpe Road at the former home of Sir Ernest Shackleton, the Antarctic explorer.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, Joaquim Augusto Fígaro Roque, Sérgio Salvo Molina Gimeno and Wagner R. Valente founded Anglo Leonardo da Vinci in Osasco. At that time, cursinhos were {{available}} primarily in São Paulo only, although Anglo was <b>already</b> <b>establishing</b> other units in São José dos Campos, Santos and Campinas.|$|R
50|$|Thailand {{already had}} a large cassava {{industry}} in the 1990s, for use as cattle feed and as a cheap admixture to wheat flour. Nigeria and Ghana are <b>already</b> <b>establishing</b> cassava-to-ethanol plants. Production of ethanol from cassava is currently economically feasible when crude oil prices are above US$120 per barrel.|$|R
40|$|The Scottish Government has {{indicated}} that it may call a second independence referendum {{as a result of}} the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Richard Rose writes that the SNP are <b>already</b> <b>establishing</b> the foundations for a new independence campaign and Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, may quickly propose legislation for another referendum once the UK triggers Article 50...|$|R
5|$|It was {{launched}} in 1985 into <b>already</b> <b>established</b> competition where Linn Sondek LP12 dominated. Other competitors included the Well Tempered Table, the Phonosophie P3, the Michell GyroDec, Pink Triangle, the Dunlop Systemdek, and the Logic DM-101. At its launch, the Xerxes was priced at around UK£300 – approximately £100 cheaper than an LP12.|$|E
5|$|The Arabs {{hoped that}} the disunity among the Byzantines would play to their advantage. Maslama had <b>already</b> <b>established</b> contact with Leo the Isaurian. French scholar Rodolphe Guilland theorized that Leo offered to become a vassal of the Caliphate, {{although}} the Byzantine general intended to use the Arabs for his own purposes. In turn, Maslama supported Leo hoping to maximize confusion and weaken the Empire, easing his own task of taking Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The empire {{reached its}} peak during the rule of Krishna Deva Raya when Vijayanagara armies were {{consistently}} victorious. The empire gained territory formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan, including Kalinga, {{in addition to the}} <b>already</b> <b>established</b> presence in the south. Many important monuments were either completed or commissioned during the time of Krishna Deva Raya.|$|E

He {{is also the}} younger brother of former goalkeeper Achmad Kurniawan, who also played for Arema Cronus. Blessed with proportional height and quick reflexes, he is <b>already</b> <b>establishing</b> himself as the first choice goalkeeper for Indonesia.|$|R
50|$|Albert Haynes {{died of a}} syncope on 21 June 1929, {{by which}} time the {{newspaper}} was <b>already</b> <b>establishing</b> a strong readership. He was succeeded by his son-in-law, British-born Henry Wesley Smith. He ran the newspaper until it was expropriated and {{taken over by the}} Alea state consortium in 1939. Throughout this period, the paper gave quiet support to British interests in Argentina.|$|R

5|$|The great Renaissance {{projects}} of Brescia were {{interrupted by the}} war. Even the Loggia palazzo, where Cairano had <b>already</b> <b>established</b> scaffolds to mount the figures on the second level, including two angular trophies, was not to see a resumption of work till fifty years later, {{under the direction of}} Ludovico Beretta. The town's priorities had changed from artistic pomp and cultural recovery to basic necessities and vital functions.|$|E
5|$|These two styles do not exhaust all of {{the musical}} {{influences}} found in the British metal music of the early 1980s, because many bands were also inspired by progressive rock (Iron Maiden, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, Demon, Saracen, Shiva, Witchfynde), boogie rock (Saxon, Vardis, Spider, Le Griffe) and glam rock (Girl, Wrathchild). Doom metal bands Pagan Altar and Witchfinder General were {{also part of the}} NWOBHM and their albums are considered among the best examples of that <b>already</b> <b>established</b> subgenre.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the <b>already</b> <b>established</b> orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E

2500|$|In sum, Magnin's plan of {{the city}} [...] "such {{as it is to}} be" [...] was a synthesizing of {{patterns}} <b>already</b> <b>establishing</b> themselves at the suburban fringes of the city and, in the city proper, an orderly filling in east and west with linear streets out to continuous roads along the waterfronts. The city government hadn't asked for it, but it seemed to be just what it wanted.|$|R
5|$|As in Iaşi, Goldfaden {{arrived in}} Bucharest with his {{reputation}} <b>already</b> <b>established.</b> He and his players performed {{first in the}} early spring at the salon Lazăr Cafegiu on Calea Văcăreşti (Văcăreşti Avenue, {{in the heart of the}} ghetto), then, once the weather turned warm, at the Jigniţa garden, a pleasant tree-shaded beer garden on Str. Negru Vodă that up until then had drawn only a neighborhood crowd. He filled out his cast from the great pool of Jewish vocal talent: synagogue cantors. He also recruited two eminently respectable classically trained prima donnas, the sisters Margaretta and Annetta Schwartz.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1600s, the Sihanaka had <b>already</b> <b>established</b> {{themselves}} {{as one of}} the island's most important trading groups. Their location on the main trade route between the coast and the Merina capital of Antananarivo enabled them to become important trading partners beginning in the 18th century; slave trading was a major source of income until outlawed under Radama I in the 1810s. The Sihanaka women also produced pottery, which was baked using wood collected by men in the surrounding forests.|$|E
5|$|Construction on I-270 {{began in}} 1965. The first portion cost about $2.7million. It opened in 1968, {{connecting}} I-70 to Vasquez Boulevard. Two years later, another two-mile (3.2km) segment connected the portion already {{in service to}} I-80S. I-80S became I-76 in 1976. Construction began on the section between I-76 and I-25 in April 1993 and was finished in September 1999, costing $11.4million. The mileposts were <b>already</b> <b>established</b> when construction took place, so the route was not assigned new mileposts. Completion of this portion largely decreased traffic problems in the area.|$|E

5|$|Globe Town was {{established}} from 1800 {{to provide for}} the expanding population of weavers around Bethnal Green, attracted by improving prospects in silk weaving. The population of Bethnal Green trebled between 1801 and 1831, with 20,000 looms being operated in people's own homes. By 1824, with restrictions on importation of French silks relaxed, up to half these looms had become idle, and prices were driven down. With many importing warehouses <b>already</b> <b>established</b> in the district, the abundance of cheap labour was turned to boot, furniture and clothing manufacture. Globe Town continued its expansion into the 1860s, long after the decline of the silk industry.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this progress, the {{relationship}} between strings and five-dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable to quantize the branes. Starting in 1991, {{a team of researchers}} including Michael Duff, Ramzi Khuri, Jianxin Lu, and Ruben Minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions curl up. If one considers a five-dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions, then the brane looks just like a one-dimensional string. In this way, the conjectured relationship between strings and branes was reduced to a relationship between strings and strings, and the latter could be tested using <b>already</b> <b>established</b> theoretical techniques.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{strategic}} {{plans for a}} decisive battle with the U.S. fleet were <b>already</b> <b>established</b> by September 1944. Anticipating the various options open to American landing forces, the Japanese operational order, code named Sho ("victory"), provided four scenarios to counter an invasion anywhere between the Philippines and the Kuriles. The plan was problematic for morale, however, because it broke with IJN tradition by assigning overriding importance to sinking U.S. supply vessels rather than U.S. warships. As a result, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet Admiral Soemu Toyoda flew out to the front in early October to rally the troops behind Sho.|$|E
