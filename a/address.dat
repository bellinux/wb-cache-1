5|$|IV: The Morris Plains <b>address</b> at 45 Hanover Avenue {{is given}} in a 1928 ad; the plant is {{described}} in the New York Times as adjoining the Morristown Line, so the <b>address</b> must be 45 East Hanover Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The Z80 {{processor}} {{used in the}} Spectrum has a 16-bit <b>address</b> bus, {{which means}} only 64KB of memory can be directly addressed. To facilitate the extra 80KB of RAM the designers used bank switching so the new memory would be available as eight pages of 16KB {{at the top of}} the <b>address</b> space. The same technique was used to page between the new 16KB editor ROM and the original 16KB BASIC ROM at the bottom of the <b>address</b> space.|$|E
5|$|A {{central theme}} of President Obama's inaugural <b>address</b> was a call to restore responsibility—both in terms of {{accountability}} in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Obama's <b>address</b> did not have memorable sound bite phrases. Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.|$|E
50|$|IPv6 <b>addresses</b> are {{classified}} by the primary <b>addressing</b> and routing methodologies common in networking: unicast <b>addressing,</b> anycast <b>addressing,</b> and multicast <b>addressing.</b>|$|R
50|$|NSAP <b>addressing</b> {{facility}} was {{added in the}} X.25(1984) revision of the specification, and this enabled X.25 to better {{meet the requirements of}} OSI Connection Oriented Network Service (CONS). Public X.25 networks were not required to make use of NSAP <b>addressing,</b> but, to support OSI CONS, were required to carry the NSAP <b>addresses</b> and other ITU-T specified DTE facilities transparently from DTE to DTE. Later revisions allowed multiple <b>addresses</b> in addition to X.121 <b>addresses</b> to be carried on the same DTE-DCE interface: Telex <b>addressing</b> (F.69), PSTN <b>addressing</b> (E.163), ISDN <b>addressing</b> (E.164), Internet Protocol <b>addresses</b> (IANA ICP), and local IEEE 802.2 MAC <b>addresses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Further to storing mobile numbers, {{users can}} add e-mail <b>addresses,</b> home-phone numbers, an image (shows when contact calls), PTT <b>addresses,</b> postal <b>addresses,</b> web <b>addresses,</b> notes, and user identification.|$|R
5|$|ADDR: <b>Address</b> of USB device (maximum of 127 devices).|$|E
5|$|After Kaycee's 'death', mourners who {{requested}} an <b>address</b> to send condolence gifts, cards, or flowers to were told that, despite previous {{acceptance of gifts}} by Kaycee, {{there was no longer}} a post-office box mailing <b>address</b> for her in Newton, Kansas. Debbie Swenson also informed Van der Woning when she told him of her death that there had already been a memorial service and Kaycee had been cremated.|$|E

50|$|Anycast <b>addresses</b> are {{syntactically}} {{identical to}} and indistinguishable from unicast <b>addresses.</b> Their {{only difference is}} administrative. Scopes for anycast <b>addresses</b> are therefore {{the same as for}} unicast <b>addresses.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{classification}} {{of all the}} known <b>addressing</b> modes is proposed and related to our simple uniform director model for the <b>addressed</b> FLC cell. Two <b>addressing</b> tricks are explained which have been found by extensive simulations with the model. <b>Addressing</b> experiments with our modes at 12 micro seconds line <b>addressing</b> time are presented. Computer-plotted voltage-time regions of operations for several <b>addressing</b> modes are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Commencement <b>Address</b> Delivered at St. Helen's Hall, Portland, Oregon. Portland: 1880.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the number}} of GPUs in the system, its initial boot was unsuccessful. This was because its {{motherboard}} uses a 32 bit BIOS, which only had approximately 3 GB of <b>address</b> space for the video cards. However, Asus managed to provide them a specialized BIOS that entirely skipped the <b>address</b> space allocation of the GTX 295 video cards. The BIOS-replacement coreboot was not tested.|$|E
50|$|Devices must support Ethernet’s MAC <b>addressing,</b> {{plus the}} Sercos III <b>addressing.</b> Other <b>addressing</b> schemes are optional.|$|R
50|$|In computing, an {{input-output}} {{memory management}} unit (IOMMU) is a {{memory management unit}} (MMU) that connects a direct-memory-access-capable (DMA-capable) I/O bus to the main memory. Like a traditional MMU, which translates CPU-visible virtual <b>addresses</b> to physical <b>addresses,</b> the IOMMU maps device-visible virtual <b>addresses</b> (also called device <b>addresses</b> or I/O <b>addresses</b> in this context) to physical <b>addresses.</b> Some units also provide memory protection from faulty or malicious devices.|$|R
50|$|BDAM accepts disk <b>addresses</b> {{as either}} actual device <b>addresses,</b> as {{relative}} track <b>addresses,</b> or as relative block numbers.|$|R
5|$|Endpoints {{are grouped}} into {{interfaces}} and each interface {{is associated with}} a single device function. An exception to this is endpoint zero, which is used for device configuration and is not associated with any interface. A single device function composed of independently controlled interfaces is called a composite device. A composite device only has a single device <b>address</b> because the host only assigns a device <b>address</b> to a function.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, Sprigg {{organized}} and was elected as the inaugural {{president of the}} West Virginia Bar Association and delivered the opening <b>address</b> at the organization's first meeting. Sprigg {{served as president of}} the bar association until 1887, and again delivered the opening <b>address</b> at the association's annual meeting that year.|$|E

40|$|We use street <b>addresses</b> {{to refer}} to {{locations}} in a city. Street <b>addresses</b> are easy to remember and communicate because they follow a symbolic <b>addressing</b> scheme, containing human intelligible symbols. However, street <b>addresses</b> can often be ambiguous or confusing and don't provide complete coverage of outdoor spaces. Latitude and longitude coordinates, a metric <b>addressing</b> scheme, are unambiguous and accommodate locations {{that may not have}} street <b>addresses.</b> However, latitude and longitude coordinates are unusable on a daily basis because they must be specified to many digits to be useful at human-level scales. This thesis describes the design and implementation of a new hybrid <b>addressing</b> scheme, Human Intelligible Positioning (HIP), which uses a metric <b>addressing</b> scheme as its substrate. <b>Addresses</b> in this metric <b>addressing</b> scheme are mapped to two-dimensional offsets within named coordinate systems. HIP <b>addresses</b> combine the easy memorability and communicability of street <b>addresses</b> with the precision and universal outdoor coverage of latitude and longitude coordinates. by Vishwanath Venugopalan.

5000|$|The fixed <b>addressing</b> can be {{problematic}} in networks with other <b>addressing</b> requirements. [...] Revision Q of the protocol <b>addressed</b> {{this problem by}} adding 10.0.0.0/8 as an <b>addressing</b> scheme, For node discovery, broadcast packets are used.|$|R
50|$|The window {{addressable}} area {{should always}} be within the Safe-Title area, so that all addressable locations are within the display window if the monitor overscans the image onto a non-rectangular screen. If the video stream has a 16:9 aspect ratio the <b>addresses</b> {{should be in the}} range 0..74 for the vertical <b>addresses,</b> and 0..209 for the horizontal <b>addresses.</b> If the video stream has a 4:3 aspect ratio the <b>addresses</b> should be in the range 0..74 for the vertical <b>addresses,</b> and 0..159 for the horizontal <b>addresses.</b> For other aspect ratios relative <b>addressing</b> should be used and both vertical and horizontal <b>addresses</b> should be in the range 0..99%.|$|R

50|$|Passive matrix <b>addressed</b> {{displays}} such as Ferro Liquid Display do {{not need}} the switch component of an active matrix display because they have built-in bistability. Technology for electronic paper also has a form of bistability. Displays with bistable pixel elements are <b>addressed</b> with a passive matrix <b>addressing</b> scheme, whereas TFT LCD displays are <b>addressed</b> using active <b>addressing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bitmessage uses cryptographically {{generated}} <b>addresses</b> (for example, BM-BcbRqcFFSQUUmXFKsPJgVQPSiFA3Xash). Bitmessage <b>addresses</b> resemble bitcoin <b>addresses,</b> and its {{keys are}} compatible with bitcoin keys.|$|R
50|$|The <b>addressing</b> modes {{listed below}} {{are divided into}} code <b>addressing</b> and data <b>addressing.</b> Most {{computer}} architectures maintain this distinction, but there are, or have been, some architectures which allow (almost) all <b>addressing</b> modes {{to be used in}} any context.|$|R
5|$|On October 30, 1970, {{less than}} two months after introduction, 26,000 Pintos were {{recalled}} to <b>address</b> a possible problem with the accelerator sticking on once engaged at more than halfway. On March 29, 1971, Ford recalled 220,000 Pintos, all Pintos manufactured prior to March 19, 1971, to <b>address</b> a possible problem with fuel vapors in the engine air filter igniting by a backfire through the carburetor.|$|E

5000|$|Spammers may harvest email <b>addresses</b> from {{a number}} of sources. A popular method uses email <b>addresses</b> which their owners have {{published}} for other purposes. Usenet posts, especially those in archives such as Google Groups, frequently yield <b>addresses.</b> Simply searching the Web for pages with <b>addresses</b> [...] - [...] such as corporate staff directories or membership lists of professional societies [...] - [...] using spambots can yield thousands of <b>addresses,</b> most of them deliverable. Spammers have also subscribed to discussion mailing lists for the purpose of gathering the <b>addresses</b> of posters. The DNS and WHOIS systems require the publication of technical contact information for all Internet domains; spammers have illegally trawled these resources for email <b>addresses.</b> Spammers have also concluded that generally, for the domain names of businesses, all of the email <b>addresses</b> will follow the same basic pattern and thus are able to accurately guess the email <b>addresses</b> of employees whose <b>addresses</b> they have not harvested. Many spammers use programs called web spiders to find email <b>addresses</b> on web pages. Usenet article message-IDs often look enough like email <b>addresses</b> that they are harvested as well. Spammers have also harvested email <b>addresses</b> directly from Google search results, without actually spidering the websites found in the search.|$|R
50|$|In the past, {{conflict}} between network <b>addresses</b> and broadcast <b>addresses</b> arose because some software used non-standard broadcast <b>addresses</b> with zeros instead of ones.|$|R
