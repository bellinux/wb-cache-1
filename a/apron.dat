50|$|Simple, {{functional}} <b>aprons</b> {{were already}} a staple {{by the time}} the Pilgrims docked on the shore of Plymouth Rock. American Indians wore <b>aprons</b> for both practical and ceremonial purposes. Early female settlers wore plain, long white <b>aprons.</b> Later, Quaker women wore long and colorful silk <b>aprons.</b> As cities in New England grew, more elaborate options began to appear. Classy American women in the 18th century wore embroidered <b>aprons</b> that sometimes dipped {{at the front of the}} waist (so as to not obscure the bodice of the gown) from 1900 through the 1920s, well-heeled women wore ornate, heavily embroidered <b>aprons.</b>|$|R
40|$|Protective <b>aprons</b> in imaging departments: {{manufacturer}} stated lead equivalence values require validation Abstract The {{composition of}} pro-tective <b>aprons</b> worn by X-ray per-sonnel to shield against secondary radiation is changing. Lead is {{being replaced by}} either lead-free or com-posite (lead with other high atomic numbered elements) materials. These newer <b>aprons</b> are categorised by manufacturers in terms of lead equivalent values, but {{it is unclear how}} these stated values compare with actual lead equivalent values. In this work, the actual lead equivalence of 41 protective <b>aprons</b> from four man-ufacturers, all specified as having 0. 25 mm lead equivalence, were investigated with transmission ex-periments at 70 and 100 kVp. All <b>aprons</b> were in current use. The <b>aprons</b> were screened for defects, and age, weight and design was recorded along with details of associated quality assurance (QA). Out of the 41 protective <b>aprons</b> examined for actual lead equivalence, 73 % were outside tolerance levels, with actual levels in some <b>aprons</b> demonstrating {{less than half of the}} nominal values. The lack of compatibility between actual and nominal lead equivalent values was demonstrated by <b>aprons</b> from three of the four manufacturers investigated. The area of the defects found on screening of the protective <b>aprons</b> were within recommendations. The results highlight the need for accep-tancy and ongoing checks of protec-tive <b>aprons</b> to ensure that radiation exposure of imaging personnel is kept to a minimum...|$|R

40|$|Objective : To {{determine}} the microbial flora present on <b>aprons</b> of dental healthcare professionals in a dental college & hospital. Materials and methods: Total 100 <b>aprons</b> of dental healthcare professionals {{were included in}} the study. An informed consent and questionnaire was taken. A cross sectional survey was designed with bacterial contamination of <b>aprons</b> in three predetermined areas (chest, pocket, sleeves). Result: It was observed that 66 % of dental healthcare professionals used to wash their <b>aprons</b> once in a week with self grading by the participants, 92 % of <b>aprons</b> were moderately clean. 71 % of dental health care professionals used to wear their <b>aprons</b> while eating and at nonclinical areas. 88 % of chest, 84 % of pocket and 71 % of sleeves of <b>aprons</b> showed growth of microorganisms. Staphylococcus aureus was the most predominant isolate followed by Bacillus species and other all isolates were either environmental microorganisms or skin commensals. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was also found, which was a matter of concern. Conclusions: <b>Aprons</b> are a potential source of cross infection even in dental settings. It is recommended that guidelines should be there for handling and washing procedures of <b>aprons...</b>|$|R

40|$|At present, interventional {{radiology}} (IVR) tends to involve long procedures (long radiation duration), and physicians are {{near to the}} source of scattered radiation. Hence, shielding is critical in protecting physicians from radiation. Protective <b>aprons</b> and additional lead-shielding devices, such as tableside lead drapes, are important means of protecting the physician from scat-tered radiation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate whether non-lead <b>aprons</b> are effective in protecting physicians from radiation during IVR procedures. In this study, the radiation protection effects of commercially available protective lead and non-lead <b>aprons,</b> when exposed to diagnostic X rays, are compared. The performance of these non-lead and lead <b>aprons</b> was similar for scattered X rays at tube voltages of 60 – 120 kV. Properly designed non-lead <b>aprons</b> are thus more suitable for phys-icians because they weigh 20 % less than the lead <b>aprons,</b> and are non-toxic...|$|R

5|$|The Mega Powers {{took the}} early {{advantage}} over DiBiase, but after Hogan attacked André {{on the ring}} <b>apron,</b> the Mega Bucks were able to regain control. After several minutes and several advantage changes, all four began brawling, with DiBiase and André getting the upper hand and throwing both Hogan and Savage from the ring. At this point, Elizabeth jumped on the ring <b>apron</b> and began arguing with Ventura. With DiBiase and André pleading with Ventura to take drastic measures to get Elizabeth off the ring, she eventually tore off her skirt and threw it into DiBiase's face. In the ensuing chaos, Hogan and Savage recovered and mounted a comeback, which saw André knocked {{out of the ring}} and DiBiase take both the Mega Powers' finishing moves -- Savage's flying elbow and Hogan's legdrop -- before taking the pinfall loss. While counting the pinfall, Ventura stopped counting at two and hesitated until Savage pushed Ventura's hand to the mat to complete the three count.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} a Last Ride match between The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy, {{where the only}} way to win was by throwing one's opponent into a hearse and driving it out of the arena. During the beginning of the match, The Undertaker tossed Kennedy into steel steps {{on the side of the}} ring and then onto the commentator's announcing table. The Undertaker then threw Kennedy into the ring <b>apron,</b> which is the <b>apron</b> covering the area under the ring. Kennedy and The Undertaker wrestled inconclusively until The Undertaker tossed Kennedy on top of the roof of the hearse. The Undertaker then delivered a Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver, both onto the roof of the hearse. As he was still in control of the match, The Undertaker threw Kennedy into the hearse and drove it out of the arena to win the match.|$|E
50|$|Volcanic vents, {{located on}} the northeastern and southwestern edges of the volcano, are sources for broad lava <b>aprons,</b> or fans, that bury nearby {{portions}} of the volcano and extend over 100 km out into the surrounding plains. The southwest-northeast orientation of the <b>aprons</b> matches {{the orientation of the}} Tharsis Montes, suggesting that a major fissure or rift in the Martian crust is responsible for the orientation of both the <b>aprons</b> and the Tharsis Montes chain. The presence of the lava <b>aprons</b> causes some disagreement in the actual dimensions of the volcano. If the <b>aprons</b> are included as part of the edifice then Ascraeus Mons has dimensions closer to 375 × 870 km.|$|R

5|$|From the 1840s onwards more mines {{provided}} crude shelters {{to protect}} surface {{workers from the}} worst of the weather, but at many others work at surface-level took place in the open air. Workers were generally expected to remain at their posts except in the most extreme weather conditions. Bal maidens wore gooks, a specialised bonnet which covered the shoulders and extended over the face to protect from rain, bright sunlight, flying debris and loud noise. In the winter the gook was made of felt, and in summer of cotton. Working in close proximity to heavy industrial machinery, they wore shorter dresses or skirts than the ankle-length clothing typical of the period, and their exposed lower legs were wrapped in protective coverings. Their arms were sometimes protected by hessian sleeves worn over their clothes. Some bal maidens working in cobbing and bucking wore rubber tubing on the fingers of one hand as protection from their hammer. While working bal maidens wore a waist-length hessian <b>apron</b> ('towser') over their clothes, and those who could afford it would have a white herden (flax and hemp) <b>apron</b> for wearing to and from work. These working clothes were accessorised with flowers, bows, ribbons, jewellery and other decoration. Until the end of the 19thcentury the working clothing of a bal maiden changed very little.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Aprons</b> {{have long}} been a doctor’s {{ornamental}} and symbolic professional wear when a doctor has been recognised, respected and valued as very significant person if he wore a long sleeved white coat with a stethoscope around the neck in the past. There have been many studies done {{about the safety of}} wearing <b>aprons</b> by the medical professionals and many countries like Great Britain have discarded and abandoned the use of long white coats as it is considered a serious threat with regards to the nosocomial infections. In India, it has still been a custom and code that a doctor and medical students wear <b>aprons</b> in the Hospital. Various studies have proved that <b>aprons</b> worn by doctors carry dangerous microbial flora. Hence, a prospective study is done to cognise the question if “Aprons are a boon or bane?. ” MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective study done to identify the bacteriological flora present on the <b>aprons</b> of 150 students in our institute NRIIMS, Visakhapatnam. The institutional approval and ethical committee clearance were taken. The swabs were taken from the pocket region of the <b>aprons</b> of all the students. The collected swabs were immediately sent to the microbiology department in different culture media including nutrient agar, blood agar and Robertson’s Cooked Meat broth. RESULTS Various bacteria are identified namely; 1. Gram-positive bacilli; 2. Micrococci; 3. Coagulase-negative staphylococcus; 4. Grampositive cocci; 5. Micrococci with gram-positive bacilli; 6. Micrococci with aerobic spore bearing bacilli; 7. Gram-negative coccobacilli; 8. Gram-positive bacilli with ASB. The significance of the study is that majority of the identified organisms were normal body flora. Out of 150 <b>aprons,</b> 38 <b>aprons</b> were found to be sterile and one or more of above-mentioned flora are identified in 112 <b>aprons.</b> 25 out of 38 <b>aprons,</b> which were found sterile were washed regularly at least once in 7 days. 74 (49. 2...|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} match on the {{pay-per-view}} {{portion of the}} show, Daniel Bryan faced Triple H; the winner would be inserted in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship main event later that night. Triple H was announced and accompanied by Stephanie McMahon. Bryan kicked away Triple H's handshake and started the match strongly, including performing a tornado DDT off the <b>apron.</b> Triple H gained the advantage by driving Bryan's injured arm into the announce table and continually attacking the arm including a hammerlock belly-to-back suplex on the <b>apron.</b> Bryan refused to submit to Triple H's submission holds of the crossface chickenwing and a regular crossface, instead reversing to his signature Yes! Lock, but Triple H reached the ropes to break the hold. Triple H countered Bryan's signature running knee with a spinebuster and his signature Pedigree maneuver, but Bryan kicked out at two. After another series of counters, Bryan hit his running knee for the three count and the win. After the match, McMahon slapped Bryan, distracting him long enough for Triple H to attack him from behind. Triple H placed Bryan's injured arm against the ring post and hit it with a steel folding chair. Bryan had to be attended to by medical staff while Triple H and McMahon celebrated on the stage.|$|E
