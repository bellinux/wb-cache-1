40|$|The {{possible}} {{discovery of}} three new gamma-ray pulsars PSR 0656 + 14, PSR 0950 + 08, and PSR 1822 - 09 (Ma, Lu, Yu, and Young, 1993) in data obtained with the COS-B experiment is reinvestigated using a refined technique for pulsar light curve analysis. The {{results of this}} study do not confirm the previously claimed gamma-ray pulsar nature of any of these pulsars. Even when using the standard epoch folding technique in conjunction with energy-dependent <b>acceptance</b> <b>cones,</b> we do not detect pulsed gamma-ray emission from these sources. We suspect that insufficient position accuracy is the cause for the discrepancy between our results and those of Ma et al. (1993). We do not rule out that any one of the three candidates, or all of them, is in fact a gamma-ray pulsar, but their spin properties must differ from those derived by Ma et al. (1993). More work is needed to determine the correct high-energy properties of these three sources...|$|R
50|$|When light {{traveling}} in a dense medium hits a boundary at a steep angle, the light will be completely reflected. This effect, called total internal reflection, {{is used in}} optical fibers to confine light in the core. Light travels along the fiber bouncing back and forth off of the boundary. Because the light must strike the boundary with an angle greater than the critical angle, only light that enters the fiber within a certain range of angles will be propagated. This range of angles is called the <b>acceptance</b> <b>cone</b> of the fiber. The size of this <b>acceptance</b> <b>cone</b> {{is a function of}} the refractive index difference between the fiber's core and cladding. Optical waveguides are used as components in integrated optical circuits (e.g. combined with lasers or light-emitting diodes, LEDs) or as the transmission medium in local and long haul optical communication systems.|$|E
50|$|This {{experiment}} {{consisted of}} a 12-cm Neher-type ionization chamber and two Lionel type 205 HT Geiger-Müller (GM) tubes. The ion chamber responded omnidirectionally to electrons above 0.7 MeV and protons above 12 MeV. Both GM tubes were mounted parallel to the spacecraft spin axis. GM tube 1 detected electrons above 45 keV that were scattered off a gold foil. The <b>acceptance</b> <b>cone</b> for these electrons had a 70-deg full-angle and an axis of symmetry that was 20 deg off the spacecraft spin axis. GM tube 2 responded to electrons and protons above 22 and 300 keV, respectively, in an <b>acceptance</b> <b>cone</b> of 70-deg full-angle centered at the spacecraft spin axis. Both GM tubes responded omnidirectionally to electrons and protons of energies above 2.5 and 50 MeV, respectively. Pulses from the ion chamber and counts from each GM tube were accumulated for 39.72 s and read out every 40.96 s. In addition, the time between the first ion chamber pulses in an accumulation period was also telemetered. This experiment performed well initially.|$|E
50|$|In optics, the {{numerical}} aperture (NA) of an optical {{system is a}} dimensionless number that characterizes the range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light. By incorporating index of refraction in its definition, NA has the property that it is constant for a beam as it goes from one material to another, provided there is no optical power at the interface. The exact {{definition of the term}} varies slightly between different areas of optics. Numerical aperture is commonly used in microscopy to describe the <b>acceptance</b> <b>cone</b> of an objective (and hence its light-gathering ability and resolution), and in fiber optics, in which it describes the range of angles within which light that is incident on the fiber will be transmitted along it.|$|E

40|$|This {{monograph}} {{describes the}} behaviour of cosmic rays in the magnetosphere of the Earth and {{of some other}} planets. Recently this has become an important topic both theoretically, because it is closely connected with the physics of the Earth’s magnetosphere, and practically, since cosmic rays determine {{a significant part of}} space weather effects on satellites and aircraft. The book contains eight chapters, dealing with – The history of the discovery of geomagnetic effects caused by cosmic rays and their importance for the determination of the nature of cosmic rays or gamma rays – The first explanations of geomagnetic effects {{within the framework of the}} dipole approximation of the Earth’s magnetic field – Trajectory computations of cutoff rigidities, transmittance functions, asymptotic directions, and <b>acceptance</b> <b>cones</b> in the real geomagnetic field taking into account higher harmonics – Cosmic ray latitude-longitude surveys on ships, trains, tracks, planes, balloons and satellites for determining the planetary distribution of the intensity of cosmic rays and how it changes with time – Geomagnetic time variations of cosmic rays caused by the changing of internal sources of Earth’s main magnetic field and variable magnetospheric current systems – Magnetospheric models and how to check them by galactic and solar cosmic rays – The behaviour of cosmic rays in the atmospheres and magnetospheres of Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. The work concludes with a discussion of future developments and unsolved problems and contains a list of about thousand full references.

Two cones used throat-to-throat accept {{radiant flux}} within one well-defined acceptance angle and redistribute it into another. If the entrance cone is fed with Lambertian flux, the exit cone produces a beam whose half-angle is the exit <b>cone's</b> <b>acceptance</b> angle and whose cross section shows uniform irradiance from near the exit mouth to infinity. (The pair is a beam angle transformer). The design of {{one pair of}} cones is discussed, also an experiment to map the irradiance of the emergent beam, and a raytracing program which models the cones fed by Lambertian flux.

5000|$|A {{multi-mode}} {{optical fiber}} will only propagate light that enters the fiber {{within a certain}} cone, known as the <b>acceptance</b> <b>cone</b> of the fiber. The half-angle of this cone is called the acceptance angle, [...] For step-index multimode fiber in a given medium, the acceptance angle is determined only by the indices of refraction of the core, the cladding, and the medium:where [...] is the refractive index of the medium, [...] is the refractive index of the fiber core, and [...] is the refractive index of the cladding. While the core will accept light at higher angles, those rays will not totally reflect off the core-cladding interface, and so will not be transmitted {{to the other end}} of the fiber.|$|E

The RPC(Resistive Plate Chamber) PAC(PAttern Comparator) Trigger system, which is a subject of this thesis, {{is a part of the}} Level- 1 Muon Trigger System. Main task of the PAC Trigger is to identify muons, measures transverse momenta and select the best muon candidates for each proton bunch collision occurring every 25 ns. To calculate the value of PAC Trigger efficiency for triggerable muon, two terms of different efficiencies are needed; acceptance efficiency and chamber efficiency.

40|$|The {{application}} of the coded aperture mask to high energy gamma-ray astronomy will provide the capability of locating a cosmic gamma-ray point source with a precision of a few arc-minutes above 20 MeV. Recent tests using a mask in conjunction with drift chamber detectors {{have shown that the}} expected point spread function is achieved over an <b>acceptance</b> <b>cone</b> of 25 deg. A telescope employing this technique differs from a conventional telescope only in that the presence of the mask modifies the radiation field {{in the vicinity of the}} detection plane. In addition to reducing the primary photon flux incident on the detector by absorption in the mask elements, the mask will also be a secondary radiator of gamma-rays. The various background components in a CAMTRAC (Coded Aperture Mask Track Chamber) telescope are considered.

40|$|Muon rate {{variations}} during Forbush effects registered {{by means}} of muon detectors DECOR, TEMP and URAGAN operated in the experimental complex NEVOD (MEPhI, Moscow) have been studied, and comparative analysis with neutron monitor data has been performed. The ratio of values of Forbush decreases in muon and in neutron fluxes is about one third, and preliminary rigidity dependence of Forbush decrease amplitude using muon data has been also obtained (for 2. 4 GV cut-off rigidity). The detection of muon flux in the hodoscopic mode allows to study the dynamics of muon flux anisotropy related with magnetic field perturbations. Results of analysis of data from the new unique muon detector URAGAN indicate the change of muon flux asymmetry direction during the Forbush decrease.

40|$|We {{investigated}} a three dimensional inverted opal {{having the}} potential to notably increase light-trapping in solar cells. The 3 D photonic crystal top layer is an angle- and direction-selective filter, which decreases the <b>acceptance</b> <b>cone</b> of the solar cell. Numerical optimisation methods are used to verify the optical and electrical properties for a large angluar and energy spectrum for a system consisting of an inverted opal {{on top of a}} thin crystalline silicon solar cell.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{investigation of}} the bound-free electron-positron pair production in relativistic heavy ion collisions is presented. Special {{attention is paid to}} the positrons emitted under large angles with respect to the beam direction. The measurement of these positrons in coincidence with the down [...] charged ions is in principle feasible by LHC experiments. In order to provide reliable estimates for such measurements, we employ the equivalent photon approximation together with the Sauter approach and derive simple analytic expressions for the differential pair [...] production cross section, which compare favorably to the results of available numerical calculations. Based on the analytic expressions, detailed calculations are performed for collisions of bare Pb$^{ 82 +}$ ions, taking typical experimental conditions of the LHC experiments into account.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a novel low cost technique for solar power capture is presented. Applications for such a system include daylighting, solar power delivery and in electricity generation systems using algae, amongst others. The proposed model uses Polymeric / Plastic Optical Fibres (POF) not only as the light transport medium but also as the light collecting mechanism. The light collecting arrangement {{is based on the}} Reciprocity Principle and consists of the curved surface of a POF that is structurally modified so that solar light can be directed into the fibre by using an analogous process to fibre side emission but in the reverse. Several arrangements have been investigated. Computer modeling confirms the achievability of an <b>acceptance</b> <b>cone</b> of at least ± 50 o. Empirical results show a 53 % increase in efficiency with 3 mm POF compared to 2 mm ones. A major advantage of this technique is the elimination of one of the two axes (orbital) of solar tracking and the considerable decrease in importance of the second axis (seasonal), currently a necessity in solar scanning systems...|$|E

40|$|The pursuit for {{improved}} engine efficiency {{is driving the}} demand for accurate temperature measurement inside turbine engines. Accurate measurement can allow engines to be operated closer to their design limits to improve thermal efficiency. It can enable engineers to verify mechanical integrity, provide better prediction of component life, validate CFD and other design tools and aid the development for leaner more efficient engines. Unfortunately, experimentally measuring surface temperatures under harsh rotating conditions is challenging. This EngD study conducted by Ashiq Hussain Khalid at the University of Manchester and Rolls-Royce plc, reviews the rationale of using phosphor thermometry over existing methods, including thermocouples, pyrometry and thermal paints/melts, which lack detail, accuracy, or are too expensive for continuous testing. Although phosphor thermometry exhibits desirable characteristics, the high temperature and fast rotating engine environment presents some challenges that {{would need to be}} addressed before a successful measurement system can be implemented. Examples of such issues include: rising blackbody radiation, restricted optical access, fibre optic constraints and limited time period to collect data. These factors will impose measurement limits and greatly influence the design philosophy of the system, including phosphor choice, phosphor lifetime characteristics, bonding technique, excitation/detection methodologies and probe design. Taking these into consideration, the research focuses on the development of phosphor thermometry systems for use in development gas turbine engines, with measurement solutions for specific engine components. The high pressure turbine blade was given research priority. A number of phosphors including YAG:Tb, YAG:Tm. Y 2 O 3 :Eu and Mg 3 F 2 GeO 4 :Mn were investigated and characterised in terms of intensity and lifetime decay, with increasing temperature up to 1500 oC. Spectral analysis and absolute intensity measurements established emission peaks and permitted comparative quantitative analysis to optimise system setup. The intensity of phosphor emission relative to Planck's blackbody radiation was also performed. YAG:Tm under 355 nm illumination was found to exhibit the highest emission intensity at high temperatures, and because its spectral emission peak at 458 nm was the lowest, its advantage in terms of blackbody radiation was further amplified. For rotating components, an upper temperature limit is reached based on the emission intensity at rising blackbody radiation levels and the system's ability to detect fast decays. A lower limit is reached based on the quenching temperature, probe design and rotational velocity. There are different methods to correct the distorted decay waveform as it traverses through the <b>acceptance</b> <b>cone</b> of the fibre. A phosphor selection criterion, taking into consideration these limitations, was successfully applied for various rotating engine components. The optical layout was setup and tested on stationary and rotating cases under laboratory conditions using similar design constraints, including fibre choice, maximum permissible lens size and target distances. A series of tests validated design methodologies and assumptions to enable testing on full scale rotating engine components. Mg 3 F 2 GeO 4 :Mn, using 355 nm illumination, was found to be the most suitable phosphor for the HP drive cone. The estimated performance under the expected rotational speeds was found to be 624 - 812 °C with a standard uncertainty of ± 0. 99 %. YAG:Tm, illuminated with 355 nm, was found to be the most promising phosphor for high pressure turbine blade measurements. The performance under the expected rotational speeds was found to be 1117 - 1375 °C with a standard uncertainty of ± 0. 97 %. This is better than other competing technologies that are currently available for temperature measurement of rotating turbine blades.
