5|$|According to {{journalist}} Rick Perlstein, in June, 1972, Daley led a mob {{on behalf}} of his father's Democratic Party regulars against pro-McGovern reformers meeting in a church in Illinois' Fifth Congressional District. The <b>action</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful and the reformers' slate (which included Rev. Jesse Jackson) replaced the Daley slate at the Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida.|$|E
5000|$|At its simplest, a rule <b>is</b> a {{conditional}} <b>action.</b> The <b>action</b> can <b>be</b> anything {{appropriate to}} the domain. For augmenting web pages, <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> page modifiers. In other domains, the <b>action</b> can <b>be</b> whatever the endpoint can consume. When a rule's <b>action</b> <b>is</b> taken, we say that the rule [...] "fired." [...] Note that the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> conditional: the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> taken only when the rule is selected and its premise is true.|$|R
50|$|Imperative: The {{imperative}} mode {{is marked}} by several different morphemes, {{depending on how the}} <b>action</b> <b>is</b> to be carried out. /pi/ is used when the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> to be carried out {{in the presence of the}} speaker, as in cenopi Look!. /pada/ is used when the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> to be completed in the absence of the speaker.|$|R
50|$|Primary <b>action</b> <b>is</b> extorsion (external rotation); {{secondary}} <b>action</b> <b>is</b> elevation; tertiary <b>action</b> <b>is</b> abduction (i.e. it extorts the eye {{and moves}} it upward and outwards). The field of maximal inferior oblique elevation is in the adducted position.|$|R
5|$|After the new {{master plan}} was {{submitted}} and approved, further <b>action</b> <b>was</b> taken by protestors; this {{was focused on}} the Harvest Forestry building at the corner of New England Street and Cheapside, which was squatted for a time.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the Belgians and the British {{concluded}} that the French were beaten and the Allied Armies in the pocket on the Belgian–Franco border would be destroyed if <b>action</b> <b>was</b> not taken. The British, having lost confidence in their Allies, decided {{to look to the}} survival of the BEF.|$|E
5|$|Early in his term, Breathitt won favor {{from both}} Whigs and Democrats by {{opposing}} South Carolina's actions during the Nullification Crisis. Following Breathitt's lead, {{the state legislature}} passed resolutions condemning the doctrine of nullification on February 2, 1833. This <b>action</b> <b>was</b> particularly significant because John C. Calhoun's justification for nullification was largely based on the 1799 Kentucky Resolutions.|$|E
50|$|The {{dependent}} <b>action</b> <b>is</b> expressed with an adverbial participle. The main <b>action</b> <b>is</b> {{conveyed by}} the verb. If also the main <b>action</b> <b>is</b> conditional (a typical usage), {{than it can}} be expressed with a verb of conditional mood. The persons need not coincide.|$|R
2500|$|The {{bioavailability}} is 100% in intravenous (IV) injection, and {{the very}} rapid onset of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> seen within seconds. The T1/2 is 14.1 to 26.2 hours. The apparent volume of distribution is between 9.5 and 21.7 L/kg. [...] The duration of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> four to six hours. If haloperidol is given as a slow IV infusion, the onset of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> slowed, and the duration of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> prolonged.|$|R
25|$|The {{essential}} {{difference is}} in what determines {{whether or not}} an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> the right <b>action.</b> Act utilitarianism maintains that an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> right if it maximizes utility; rule utilitarianism maintains that an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> right if it conforms to a rule that maximizes utility.|$|R
5|$|For a time, no overt <b>action</b> <b>was</b> taken, and {{the plans}} {{continued}} to evolve. A further refinement {{of the plan}} was developed by William and McGeorge Bundy on 29 November 1964, with a more moderate target list, which the Joint Chiefs opposed. No <b>action</b> <b>was</b> taken while these, and other, plans were considered. But matters {{came to a head}} with the attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965, which demanded immediate action, and resulted in a reprisal raid known as Operation Flaming Dart. A sapper raid against an American enlisted men's billet at Qui Nhon on the 10th led to Flaming Dart II. These small-scale operations were launched against the southern region of the country, where the bulk of North Vietnam's ground forces and supply dumps were located.|$|E
5|$|Gunboat {{diplomacy}} {{was typically}} conducted by cruisers or smaller warships. A British squadron of three protected cruisers and two gunboats {{brought about the}} capitulation of Zanzibar in 1896; and while battleships participated in the combined fleet Western powers deployed during the Boxer rebellion, the naval part of the <b>action</b> <b>was</b> performed by gunboats, destroyers and sloops.|$|E
5|$|In 1812, Jonathan Jennings {{defeated}} Harrison's chosen {{candidate and}} became the territory's representative to Congress. Jennings immediately introduced legislation to grant Indiana statehood, even though {{the population of the}} entire territory was under 25,000, but no <b>action</b> <b>was</b> taken on the legislation because of the outbreak of the War of 1812.|$|E
50|$|Following {{intramuscular}} injection, the antiemetic <b>action</b> <b>is</b> evident within 5 to 10 {{minutes and}} lasts for 3 to 4 hours.

50|$|Therefore, {{there are}} six phases in the game where players may take <b>actions.</b> There <b>are</b> 10 <b>actions</b> the players may take during these seasons, the order of which is {{randomly}} decided {{at the beginning of}} each season.

The first of the hidden <b>actions</b> <b>is</b> revealed after the completion by all players of the first action, and so on until all <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> revealed by the time the fifth <b>action</b> <b>is</b> taken by all players.

5|$|No {{management}} <b>action</b> <b>was</b> taken {{until the}} late 1980s and early 1990s, when after years of flourishing population, the island's carrying capacity was exceeded. Malnourishment caused by overcrowding resulted {{in the deaths of}} several horses; the reserve's staff instituted a birth control program to restrict the herd to about 40animals.|$|E
5|$|No {{official}} <b>action</b> <b>was</b> taken: Ireland was exporting food to Britain at the time. Also, Paul Emrys-Evans {{revealed that}} the convoy knew about the U-boat; the British stance was that, as it already knew {{of the presence of}} both Irish Oak and U-607, {{there was no need for}} Irish Oak to have warned the convoy.|$|E

5|$|The Victoria Cross {{has been}} awarded 1,358 times to 1,355 {{individual}} recipients.

The largest number awarded for a single <b>action</b> <b>was</b> 18, for the assault on Sikandar Bagh, during the Second Relief of Lucknow.
