5|$|Armillaria gallica may {{itself be}} parasitized by other soil flora. Several {{species of the}} fungus Trichoderma, {{including}} Trichoderma polysporum, T.harzianum and T.viride, are able to attack and penetrate <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> tissue of A.gallica rhizomorphs and parasitize the internal hyphae. The infected rhizomorphs become devoid of living hyphae about {{one week after the}} initial infection. Entoloma abortivum is another fungus that can live parasitically upon A.gallica. The whitish-gray malformed fruit bodies that may result are due to the E.abortivum hyphae penetrating the mushroom and disrupting its normal development.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, the {{archaeologist}} {{and historian}} Patrick Healy discovered {{the remains of}} a prehistoric wedge tomb in the woods. All the survives is the skeletal outline of the main chamber <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> double walls.

5|$|In the autumn, {{the leaves}} die back <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> {{scales of the}} bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is then {{normally}} harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point {{in the middle of}} the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The inflorescence takes the form of a globular umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} dismount the eight guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck and stow them on chocks on the deck during daylight {{to prevent them from}} being damaged by muzzle blast from the main guns. Gun trials in December 1906 proved that this was a bit more difficult than expected and the two port guns from the forecastle <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> starboard gun from the quarterdeck were transferred to turrets' roofs, giving each turret two guns. The remaining forecastle guns <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> port gun from the quarterdeck were removed by the end of 1907, which reduced the total to twenty-four guns. During her April–May 1915 refit the two guns from the roof of 'A' turret were reinstalled in the original positions on the starboard side of the quarterdeck. A year later, the two guns {{at the rear of the}} superstructure were removed, reducing her to twenty-two guns. Two of the quarterdeck guns were given high-angle Mark IV*C mounts for anti-aircraft duties and the two guns abreast the conning tower were removed in 1917.|$|E

5|$|The wall {{contained}} nine main gates, which pierced {{both the}} inner <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> walls, {{and a number}} of smaller posterns. The exact identification of several gates is debatable for a number of reasons. The Byzantine chroniclers provide more names than the number of the gates, the original Greek names fell mostly out of use during the Ottoman period, and literary and archaeological sources provide often contradictory information. Only three gates, the Golden Gate, the Gate of Rhegion and the Gate of Charisius, can be established directly from the literary evidence.|$|E
