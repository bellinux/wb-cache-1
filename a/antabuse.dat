5|$|Disulfiram (<b>Antabuse)</b> {{prevents}} {{the elimination of}} acetaldehyde, a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself {{is the cause of}} many hangover symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting uncomfortable hangover. This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in significant amounts while they take the medicine.|$|E
25|$|The drug {{disulfiram}} (<b>Antabuse)</b> {{prevents the}} oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic acid. <b>Antabuse</b> is sometimes {{used as a}} deterrent for alcoholics wishing to stay sober.|$|E

25|$|Acamprosate, {{disulfiram}} and topiramate (a novel anticonvulsant sulphonated sugar) {{are also}} used to treat alcohol addiction. Acamprosate has shown effectiveness for patients with severe dependence, helping them to maintain abstinence for several weeks or months. Disulfiram (also called <b>Antabuse)</b> produces a very unpleasant reaction when drinking alcohol that includes flushing, nausea and palpitations. It is more effective for patients with high motivation and some addicts use it only for high risk situations.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Edwards was {{assigned}} to a medical malpractice lawsuit that had been perceived to be unwinnable; the firm had accepted it only {{as a favor to}} an attorney and state senator {{who did not want to}} keep it. Nevertheless, Edwards won a $3.7 million verdict on behalf of his client, who had suffered permanent brain and nerve damage after a doctor prescribed an overdose of the anti-alcoholism drug <b>Antabuse</b> during alcohol aversion therapy. In other cases, Edwards sued the American Red Cross three times, alleging transmission of AIDS through tainted blood products, resulting in a confidential settlement each time, and defended a North Carolina newspaper against a libel charge.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "tippler's bane" [...] {{is derived}} from its ability to create acute {{sensitivity}} to alcohol, similar to disulfiram (<b>Antabuse).</b> Other common names include common ink cap and inky cap. The black liquid that this mushroom releases after being picked was once used as ink.|$|E
500|$|The {{evaluation}} of a bee model for ethanol inebration of vertebrates has just begun, but appears to be promising. The bees are fed ethanol solutions and their behavior observed. Researchers place the bees in tiny harnesses, and feed them varying concentrations of alcohol introduced into sugar solutions. Tests of locomotion, foraging, social interaction and aggressiveness are performed. Mustard has noted that [...] "Alcohol affects bees and humans in similar ways—it impairs motor functioning along with learning and memory processing." [...] The interaction of bees with <b>antabuse</b> (disulfiram, a common medication administered {{as a treatment for}} alcoholism) has been tested as well.|$|E
2500|$|According to the label, {{sertraline}} is contraindicated {{in individuals}} taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors or the antipsychotic pimozide (Orap). Sertraline concentrate contains alcohol, {{and is therefore}} contraindicated with disulfiram (<b>Antabuse).</b> The prescribing information recommends that treatment of the elderly and patients with liver impairment [...] "must be approached with caution." [...] Due to the slower elimination of sertraline in these groups, their exposure to sertraline may {{be as high as}} three times the average exposure for the same dose.|$|E
2500|$|According to Carney, {{he was an}} {{alcoholic}} by his late teens. His first stage partner, comedian Ollie O'Toole, [...] "would order gin and grapefruit juice {{for us in the}} morning and, gee, it was great." [...] Carney would later use barbiturates and amphetamines as well as alcohol substitutes, and also tried psychotherapy and joined Alcoholics Anonymous to battle his addiction, which he said ran in the family. He finally found success with <b>Antabuse</b> and quit drinking during the filming of Harry and Tonto.|$|E
2500|$|After nearly {{drinking}} {{himself to}} death during the shooting of The Klansman (1974), Burton was dried out at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Burton was allegedly inebriated while making the movie, {{and many of his}} scenes had to be filmed with him sitting or lying down due to his inability to stand upright. In some scenes, he appears to slur his words or speak incoherently. According to his own diaries, he used <b>Antabuse</b> to try to stop his excessive consumption of alcohol, which he blamed for wrecking his marriage to Elizabeth Taylor. Burton himself said of the time leading up to his near loss of life, [...] "I was fairly sloshed for five years. I was up there with John Barrymore and Robert Newton. The ghosts of them were looking over my shoulder." ...|$|E
2500|$|More recently, {{studies using}} animal models {{have begun to}} {{elucidate}} the effects of ethanol on the nervous system. Traditionally, many studies have been performed in mammals, such as mice, rats, and non-human primates. However, non-mammalian animal models have also been employed; in particular, the Ulrike Heberlein group at UC San Francisco has used Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, taking advantage of its facile genetics to dissect the neural circuits and molecular pathways, upon which ethanol acts. The series of studies carried in the Heberlein lab has identified insulin and its related signaling pathways as well as biogenic amines in the invertebrate nervous system as being important in alcohol tolerance. The value of <b>antabuse</b> (disulfiram) {{as a treatment for}} alcoholism has been tested using another invertebrate animal model, the honey bees. [...] It {{is important to note that}} some of the analogous biochemical pathways and neural systems have been known to be important in alcohol's effects on humans, while the possibility that others may also be important remains unknown. Research of alcohol's effects on the nervous system remains a hot topic of research, as scientists inch toward understanding the problem of alcohol addiction.|$|E

5000|$|The Shadow Brook Health Foundation, a 25-bed male only treatment, {{opened in}} 1948. In 1949, Bell {{sponsored}} {{the arrival of}} the drug <b>Antabuse</b> in Canada. He used <b>Antabuse</b> to treat patients while working {{on the development of the}} drug Temposil, an anti-drinking drug with less severe side effects. He served as the chairman for the Committee on Problem Drinking (now known as the American Occupational Medical Association) from 1951 to 1958, where he worked to change the negative attitude the medical community held toward alcoholic employees. [...] In 1951, he also opened Willowdale Hospital for Women to treat female patients.|$|E

50|$|Cefoperazone {{contains}} an N-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT or 1-MTT) side chain. As the antibiotic is broken {{down in the}} body, it releases free NMTT, which can cause hypoprothrombinemia (likely due to inhibition of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by disulfiram (<b>Antabuse),</b> due to inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea that}} {{acetaldehyde}} {{is the cause}} of the flush is also shown by the clinical use of disulfiram (<b>Antabuse),</b> which blocks the removal of acetaldehyde from the body via ALDH inhibition. The high acetaldehyde concentrations described share similarity to symptoms of the flush (flushing of the skin, accelerated heart rate, shortness of breath, throbbing headache, mental confusion and blurred vision).|$|E
50|$|Disulfiram (trade name <b>Antabuse)</b> {{creates a}} sudden acute {{response}} to ethanol consumption by inhibiting an enzyme that metabolizes ethanol. In the liver, ethanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenease to produce acetaladehye {{which is then}} metabolized by acetaldehyde dehydrogenease to produce acetic acid. Disulfiram interferes with the acetaldehyde dehydrogenease preventing acetaldehyde metabolism. This buildup of acetaldehyde is responsible for immediate “hangover” effects such as vomiting, nausea, and headaches.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} structure of cefotetan, {{like that of}} several other cephalosporins, contains an N-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT or 1-MTT) side chain. As the antibiotic is broken down in the body, it releases free NMTT, which can cause hypoprothrombinemia (likely due to inhibition of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by disulfiram (<b>Antabuse),</b> due to inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase.|$|E
50|$|Latamoxef {{has been}} {{associated}} with prolonged bleeding time, and several cases of coagulopathy, some fatal, were reported during the 1980s. Latamoxef is no longer available in the United States. As with other cephalosporins with a methylthiotetrazole side chain, latamoxef causes an <b>antabuse</b> reaction when mixed with alcohol. Additionally, the methylthiotetrazole side chain inhibits γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid; this can interfere with the actions of vitamin K.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} structure of cefamandole, {{like that of}} several other cephalosporins, contains an N-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT or 1-MTT) side chain. As the antibiotic is broken down in the body, it releases free NMTT, which can cause hypoprothrombinemia (likely due to inhibition of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase)(vitamin K supplement is recommended during therapy) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by disulfiram (<b>Antabuse),</b> due to inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase.|$|E
5000|$|Dopamine β-hydroxylase inhibitors like {{disulfiram}} (<b>Antabuse),</b> {{which can}} be used in the treatment of addiction to cocaine and similar dopaminergic drugs as a deterrent drug. The excess dopamine resulting from inhibition of the dopamine β-hydroxylase enzyme increases unpleasant symptoms such as anxiety, higher blood pressure, and restlessness. Disulfiram is not an anticraving agent, because it does not decrease craving for drugs. Instead, positive punishment from its unpleasant effects deters drug consumption.|$|E

50|$|In 1951, AHP {{launched}} <b>Antabuse,</b> a {{drug for}} the treatment of alcoholism, as well as the antihistamine Phenergan. Ansolyen was launched the next year as a high blood pressure medication. The anticonvulsant Mysoline was introduced in 1954. Other drugs introduced during this time include Isordil, a vasodilator for treatment of angina, Dryvax, a freeze-dried smallpox vaccine, and Ovral, a combined oral contraceptive pill. Pharmaceuticals were generating an ever-increasing percentage of AHP's sales.|$|E
5000|$|When {{combined}} with the consumption of alcohol, it causes [...] "Coprinus syndrome". Symptoms include facial reddening, nausea, vomiting, malaise, agitation, palpitations and tingling in limbs, and arise five to ten minutes after consumption of alcohol. The signs {{are similar to those}} induced by disulfiram (<b>Antabuse)</b> and subsequent alcohol consumption. If no more alcohol is consumed, the symptoms will generally subside over two or three hours. Symptom severity is proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed.|$|E
50|$|Calcium carbimide, sold as the citrate salt {{under the}} trade name Temposil, is an alcohol {{sensitizing}} agent. Its effects {{are similar to}} the drug disulfiram (<b>Antabuse)</b> in that it interferes with the normal metabolism of alcohol by preventing the breakdown of the metabolic byproduct acetaldehyde. The result is that when alcohol is consumed by users of calcium carbimide, they experience severe reactions which include symptoms such as sweating, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, rash, nausea and vomiting, and headache.|$|E
