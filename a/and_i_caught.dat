5|$|C'est trop bête d'en parler (It's {{too stupid}} to talk about). There was a break. Coppi {{attacked}}. His brother Fausto gave him a push to get him away. He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit and then I attacked <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
60|$|Rose was {{standing}} {{very close to}} me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> distinctly the note of scorn in her indulgent compassion.|$|E
60|$|Two {{more days}} passed, but the cuts did not pass, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> Martin soaking {{his feet and}} legs in a pail of hot water.|$|E
5000|$|<b>And</b> next <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> {{a glimpse}} of {{powerful}} Heracles—:His ghost I mean: the man himself delights ...|$|R
60|$|She {{gave me a}} quick look, <b>and</b> again <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> that dancing, tremulous {{light and}} {{something}} more in her eyes. But it was only for the moment. Then she smiled.|$|R
6000|$|As I {{turned him}} over {{to see if he}} were dead, his eyes met mine, and were full of piteous entreaty; his lips moved, <b>and</b> {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> the words: ...|$|R
60|$|He set {{the candle}} on the table, then {{carrying}} {{his hand to}} his girdle he withdrew it sharply, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> the gleam of a dagger.|$|E
60|$|But as Thurid's foot swung so did mine, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> him {{a painful}} blow upon the shin bone that saved Xodar from this added ignominy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ride to meet them, Michelot!" [...] I cried. Obediently he wheeled to the left, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> the swish of {{his sword}} as {{it left the}} scabbard.|$|E
6000|$|Early in {{the morning}} I was roused from my sleep {{by the sound of}} little voices singing with great {{animation}} in the room next to mine, <b>and,</b> listening, <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> the following words:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Having {{found the}} flower and driven a bee away, [...] I leaned my head, [...] And holding by the stalk, [...] <b>I</b> listened <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> the word-- [...] What was it? Did {{you call me}} by my name? [...] Or did you say-- [...] Someone said 'Come'--I heard it as I bowed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] {{the patient}} admitted. [...] "I {{was on my}} way--Charing Cross to the Kensington Palace Hotel, on a bicycle. There was a block--corner of Pall Mall <b>and</b> Haymarket. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> hold--taxi in front--to steady me." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me queerly. I saw her lips {{trembling}} and the tears swimming up in her eyes. She swayed toward me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> her in my arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Blodgett {{was driving}} {{in some of}} Tyner's calves, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> him. I told him what I thought of him, and he shot at me through his pocket. That was all." ...|$|E
6000|$|This was strong, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> myself up, but {{the girl}} offered me the pardon of a {{beautiful}} wan smile. [...] "So Ray himself declares. He says he has stooped so low." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the turn}} into the cantonments we heard {{carriage}} wheels. It was the Colonel's barouche, and in it sat the Colonel's wife <b>and</b> daughter. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> a suppressed chuckle, and my beast sprang forward with a lighter step.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let us go then,' <b>I</b> {{answered}} huskily, <b>and</b> {{drew her}} behind {{the trunk of}} the old beech. <b>And</b> there <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> her in my arms and kissed her again and yet again, nor was she ashamed to kiss me back.|$|R
60|$|For {{a little}} while he {{remained}} there, then he withdrew, leaving the casement open, <b>and</b> presently <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> the grating of a chair on the parquet floor within. If ever the gods favoured mortal, they favoured me at that moment.|$|R
60|$|It was Banks. For {{a second}} time he had given me an {{affecting}} example of his faithfulness. I forgot that he was my servant, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> his hand and pressed it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'By Jove! {{that is an}} idea! Of {{course there}} are. I knew you'd see me through. We'll defeat them yet. Hi, pup!... He's gone. Absolutely disappeared!' He sighed with relief, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> the lucky moment.|$|E
60|$|I {{had never}} thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began to {{consider}} them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so strong, that it became infectious, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> it.|$|E
60|$|Madame Blumenthal seemed, for the time, to have abjured the Kursaal, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never <b>caught</b> {{a glimpse}} of her. Her young friend, apparently, was an {{interesting}} study, and the studious mind prefers seclusion.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is your {{eleventh}} fish which I am {{bound by}} my oath to render to you," [...] said the censitaire. [...] "There are seventy-three in the heap, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>caught</b> eight hundred in the month." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was a mere}} kennel. Foul old mats, {{and broken}} cocoa-nut shells, and calabashes were strewn about the floor of earth; <b>and</b> {{overhead}} <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> glimpses of the stars through chinks in the roof. Here and there the thatch had fallen through, and hung down in wisps.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> {{it up as}} {{the name}} of the recruit--I was indeed {{occupied}} at the moment by my anxiety about my wife. But this Middlemas, since such is his name, is a wild young fellow, I suppose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At first I was {{uncertain}} about it. But when I came back that way I looked again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> him peeping {{out at me}} {{from one of the}} bar-room windows. As soon as he saw me look he dodged out of sight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{we were on}} a big {{ship and}} the storm came and wrecked it," [...] {{explained}} the girl. [...] "But Hank <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> hold of a raft and floated ashore to this place, and--we're tired and hungry. What country is this, please?" ...|$|E
6000|$|If Josephine had {{not said}} that, I {{might not have}} gone on. But she did say it, <b>and,</b> moreover, <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> Mary Gillespie <b>and</b> Adella Gilbert exchanging {{significant}} smiles. That settled it, and made me quite reckless. [...] "In for a penny, in for a pound," [...] thought <b>I,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said with a pensive smile: ...|$|R
60|$|Mariposilla {{had never}} before {{addressed}} me in the quaint, affectionate style of her anglicized tongue, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> her in my arms, laughing at the sweet, sober compliment, I told her how I would always treasure it for her sake--the most delightful praise I had ever received.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is yesterday's work. I've {{been trying}} for days to get a certain effect of color, <b>and,</b> behold! <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> it flying this morning. What puzzles me in your country is the {{enormously}} high value of your earth {{in reference to the}} sky. The sky is so solid." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{opening of}} the little door in the {{panelled}} wall made me start and turn. Her beautiful serene eyes met mine as she came towards me. She stopped and laid her hand upon her bosom, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> her in my arms.|$|E
60|$|He obeyed. The {{carriage}} drew to {{the side}} of the road. We rushed by, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> a glimpse of three faces. My spirits rose. There was only the Baron to deal with. Madame Richard and Isobel were the other occupants of the carriage.|$|E
60|$|I {{stopped and}} talked {{all the time}} I was there to Irene; but, somehow, {{whatever}} I said, Césarine managed to intercept it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> myself quite guiltily looking at her from time to time, with an inexpressible attraction that I could not account for.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look!" [...] she said, stooping low, {{and laying}} her slim left hand, palm downwards, across my table. <b>I</b> did look; <b>and</b> {{the first thing}} I noticed was how like herself that hand was, and how much less {{vigorous}} and formidable than Fanny's. <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> her meaning.|$|R
60|$|I held my candle high, <b>and</b> {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> {{a glimpse}} of the man's head staring at me over a barrel. He had a gold chevron on his black cap, and the expression of his face told me in an instant that he was an officer and a man of refinement.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{were the}} names of the other two?" [...] he asked. [...] "Him Carthew shot in the companion, <b>and</b> the one <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> in the jaw on the main top-gallant?" ...|$|R
