The CERN field computation program ROXIE has recently been extended to calculate the persistent current using a semi-analytical hysteresis model for hard superconductors. The model is combined with the coupling method of finite- and boundary-elements for the calculation of the non-linear iron yoke. Thi numerical method avoids the meshing of <b>air</b> <b>domains</b> and of the superconducting coil. Disjoint ferromagnetic iron domains can be meshed independently.

40|$|International audienceHere {{we report}} a 2 D {{computational}} fluid dynamics simulation of the non-linear oscillating-flow behavior in a helium-filled half-wavelength standing thermoacoustic refrigerator. The finite-volume method is used, and the solid and <b>air</b> <b>domains</b> are represented by large numbers of quadrilateral and triangular elements. The calculations assume a periodic structure to reduce the computational cost and apply the dynamic mesh technique {{to account for the}} oscillating adiabatic equivalent wall boundaries. The simulation uses an implicit time integration of the full unsteady compressible flow equations with a conjugate heat transfer algorithm (ANSYS FLUENT). A Typical run involves 12000 elements and a total simulation time of five seconds. Simulation Results for drive ratios Dr= 0. 28 %- 2 % are compared to the Swift linear theory and the numerical analysis of Worlikar et al., and show better agreement with the experimental values of Atchley. A maximum cooling effect of three degrees is predicted at a non-dimensional wave number kx= 3 π/ 4, measured from the resonator rigid end.

A Newton-Raphson method, in which the interaction matrix must be built at each solver iteration, is used to solve the nonlinear formulation.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the process of wind-wave generation by using direct numerical simulation (DNS).

In this paper we improve the work published by Lin et al. (2008). Instead of simplified linear boundary conditions (BCs), we derive and impose the non-linear BCs for normal stress at interface, as well as non-linear curvature terms used to balance the discontinuity. The results show that at the linear (initial) stage, faster wave growth is seen with non-linear BCs than with linearized BCs. This is reversed during the exponential (developed) stage...|$|E
40|$|A novel hybrid {{approach}} for solving magnetostatic problems with an unbounded <b>air</b> <b>domain</b> is presented. The basic {{idea is to}} use augmented dual grids for interfacing the cell method (CM) and Boundary Element Method by indirect coupling, introducing equivalent surface field sources. The field problem in bounded domains is discretized by the CM in terms of integral variables, i. e., line integrals of the magnetic vector potential. Boundary integral conditions, formulated with the reduced magnetic scalar potential, are applied to avoid the air region meshing. A mixed final symmetric algebraic system, which can be solved by fast iterative solvers, such as Minimal Residual Method or SYMMLQ, is finally obtained. The magnetic field in the air region is then easily reconstructed from the equivalent sources. Numerical tests show that the hybrid method is accurate even by using a collocation {{approach for}} discretizing the boundary integral conditions...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a method for {{constrained}} shape optimization governed with a nonlinear axisymmetric magnetostatic state problem and we apply it to an optimal shape design of an electromagnet. The state problem is solved via Hiptmair’s symmetric coupling of finite elements employed in the interior ferromagnetic domain and boundary elements modelling the exterior <b>air</b> <b>domain</b> as well as current excitations. As a novelty we derive Duffy regularization transforms of the boundary element integrals for the axisymmetric case, which are then evaluated using a tensor-product Gaussian quadrature. Nonlinear ferromagnetic behaviour is resolved by Newton iterations. The optimization method under both linear and nonlinear constraints relies on the active-set steepest-descent search, projections onto the set of linearized constraints, and an adjoint method of shape sensitivity analysis. Shape perturbations influence grid deformation via a solution to an auxiliary torsion-free linear elasticity problem. Finally, numerical results are presented. Web of Science 82101731172...|$|E
