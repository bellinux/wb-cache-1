5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life.

They're really fun photos. <b>And</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through his}} {{four-year}} term, Meisdalshagen was appointed Minister of Finance in Gerhardsen's Second Cabinet. He served from 6 December 1947 to 19 November 1951, when Torp's Cabinet was formed. Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen and former party secretary Martin Tranmæl were the architects behind his appointment. Ultimately, Meisdalshagen's {{opposition to the}} Labour Party's foreign and defence policy in general, and extraordinary monetary grants for defence measures specifically, was cited {{as the reason for}} his resignation from the cabinet, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> the entire cabinet shift. During his period as minister, Meisdalshagen's parliamentary seat was occupied by Gunnar Kalrasten until June 1948 and then by Thorvald Ulsnæs. He was succeeded as Minister of Finance by Trygve Bratteli; other candidates were discussed but rejected, including Meisdalshagen's old acquaintance Klaus Sunnanå.|$|E

5|$|Entertainment {{is a form}} of {{activity}} that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but {{is more likely to be}} one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> a global audience.|$|E
5|$|Larrea {{did not get}} on {{well with}} Brown, who blamed him for {{disagreements}} and supply shortages, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> discontent among the sailors. Buenos Aires {{did not have a}} naval tradition, and therefore most of the people involved in the naval campaign were foreigners. As a result, their commitment to the war was often limited. After the capture of Montevideo, Larrea instructed Brown to report directly to the minister of war, and not correspond with himself. Nevertheless, the disagreements continued. Due to the economic crisis caused by the war, Larrea sold the captured ships, decommissioned the navy and sold off the government's own ships, but the sailors complained that they had not received their wages, their reward for the military victory nor their percentage of the sale of the captured ships. Larrea and White were blamed for this. Larrea resigned {{by the end of the}} year, after signing an order for the creation of an infantry and a cavalry regiment for the Army of the Andes. Larrea blamed White for the unresolved dispute over the sailors' wages, declaring that he had arranged that White would organize the payment of the wages. Alvear resigned in 1815 after the mutiny of Álvarez Thomas, and all the members of his administration were put on trial. Larrea was accused of abuse of power, administrative fraud and stealing from the national treasury. All his properties were confiscated, and he was exiled.|$|E

25|$|One article {{stated that}} at the time of their marriage, a Bonaparte would have had an easy chance of obtaining at least two million votes if a {{plebiscite}} were to occur.

25|$|A {{polynomial}} equation {{for which}} one is interested only in the solutions which are integers is called a Diophantine equation. Solving Diophantine equations is generally a very hard task. It has been proved that there cannot be any general algorithm for solving them, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> deciding whether the set of solutions is empty (see Hilbert's tenth problem). Some {{of the most famous}} problems that have been solved during the fifty last years are related to Diophantine equations, such as Fermat's Last Theorem.|$|E

Jerabek or J. Serarols. However, lately investigations also go towards using SIRs for the separation of natural compounds, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> separation of biotechnological products.|$|E

25|$|The {{centerline}} position code is {{zero for}} a compartment on the ship's centerline, odd numbers for compartments entirely to starboard of the centerline, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> compartments entirely to port. For compartments {{sharing the same}} deck and forward frame, the first {{two parts of the}} code are identical, and the third part of the code is numbered outward from the centerline. For example, four main-deck compartments at frame 90 would be 1-90-1-L inboard and 1-90-3-L outboard on the starboard side of the ship and 1-90-2-L inboard and 1-90-4-L outboard on the port side.|$|E
25|$|By using {{a minimalist}} design that used regular (light) water for cooling and {{graphite}} for moderation, {{it was possible}} to use natural uranium for fuel (instead of the considerably more expensive enriched uranium). This allowed for an extraordinarily large and powerful reactor that was also cheap enough to be built in large numbers and simple enough to be maintained and operated by local personnel. For example, the RBMK reactors at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant in Lithuania were rated at 1500MWe each, a very large size for the time <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>for</b> today.|$|E
