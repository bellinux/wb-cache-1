This idea is hard to prove one way or the other but has been acknowledged by many writers and scholars such as Professor Robert Matz from George Mason University. It is difficult to tell if the speaker has a genuine respect and admiration for his friend or if there is more to it than that. However, this debate always comes down to personal opinions and it is up to the reader to decide what they would like to believe. [...] Shakespeare uses many descriptions in this sonnet that are interpreted as sexual references. Renowned Shakespeare critic Joseph Pequigney writes in his book Such is my Love that line 10, [...] "makes the most open reference to <b>auto-eroticism.</b> Being infecund, it involves both the expenditure of seed for self-gratification and withholding it from reproduction". As Pequigney explains, in this sonnet not only is the speaker trying to convince his friend the young man to have children, but he is making an argument against masturbation, which is something the speaker sees as selfish and a waste of the young man's great genetics. This line also contributes to the reason why this sonnet has been called [...] "A Disquisition Forbidding Masturbation" [...] by Joseph Pequigney. This subject of masturbation goes hand in hand with the idea of being alone and dying without producing children or heirs, something which the speaker thinks would be a selfish act and would deprive the future earth of beauty.|$|E
5000|$|Ellis' {{views of}} <b>auto-eroticism</b> were very comprehensive, {{including}} {{much more than}} masturbation. <b>Auto-eroticism,</b> according to Ellis, includes {{a wide range of}} phenomena. Dr. Ellis states in his 1897 book Studies in the Psychology of Sex, that <b>auto-eroticism</b> ranges from erotic day-dreams, marked by a passivity shown by the subject, to “unshamed efforts at sexual self-manipulation witnessed among the insane.” ...|$|E
50|$|Ellis {{also raises}} social concern of how auto-erotic tendencies are {{affecting}} marriages. He {{goes on to}} tying <b>auto-eroticism</b> to declining marriage rates. As these rates decline, he concludes that <b>auto-eroticism</b> will only increase in both amount and intensity {{for both men and}} women. Therefore, he states, this is an important issue to both the moralist and physician to investigate psychological underpinnings of these experiences and determine an attitude toward them.|$|E
5000|$|Ellis {{also argues}} that auto-erotic impulses can be {{heightened}} by bodily processes like menstrual flow. During this time, he says, women, who would otherwise not feel a strong propensity for <b>auto-eroticism,</b> increase their masturbation patterns. This trend is absent, however, in women without a conscious acceptance of their sexual feelings and in {{a small percentage of}} women suffering from a sexual or general ailment which result in a significant amount of “sexual anesthesia.” ...|$|E

Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: [...] "If I had been the agent for one of the stars, like Goldblum, Michelle Pfeiffer, Richard Farnsworth or Kathryn Harrold, I think I would have protested to the front office that Landis was engaging in cinematic <b>auto-eroticism</b> and that my clients were getting lost {{in the middle of the}} family reunion." [...] Time Out wrote: [...] "The casting of innumerable major film-makers in small roles seems an unnecessary bit of elbow-jogging, but David Bowie makes an excellent contribution as an English hit man, and the two leading players are excellent: Pfeiffer in particular takes the sort of glamorous yet preposterous part that generally defeats even the best actress and somehow contrives to make it credible every inch of the way." ...|$|E

40|$|Diseases of the anus and rectum are {{frequently}} {{the outcome of}} proctogenital and oral-anal sexual activities. These sexually transmitted diseases are more common among homosexual and bisexual men than among heterosexuals. A variety of infectious agents are responsible including viruses, bacteria, spirochetes, helminths, and protozoa. Anal warts, herpetic ulcers, and syphilitic chancres are common anal STDs. Gonorrhea, herpes, and chlamydial organisms are common causes of venereal acute proctitis. Enteric infections such as shigellosis, amebiasis, giardiasis and pinworms can be transmitted by oral-anal contact.

40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} expose the incoherencies within the {{activity}} of bodybuilding, suggesting that both the bodybuilder's body and the activity of bodybuilding {{can be regarded as}} 'queer'. However, the paper will not use 'queer' as a trendy synonym for 'gay' but will focus on queer's potential to describe mismatches of sex, gender and sexuality. 'Queer' draws its subversive potential from being in opposition with 'normal' rather than 'heterosexual'. The paper will argue that the extreme, competition standard, male bodybuilder's body is a gender dissident body which simultaneously affirms masculine and feminine characteristics: muscles and angularity are combined with curvaceousness, hairlessness and made-up skin. A body which offers a haemorrhaging of meaning. The second part of the paper will focus on the activity of training in the gym. It will suggest that the experience of pumping up, which has famously been described as a sexual experience, is a form of dissonant sexuality. The <b>auto-eroticism</b> of pumping up in the gym can even be described in the archaic term of 'onanism'. The paper will conclude by asking why someone would want to push his body to such an extreme degree of freakiness and will suggest that the condition of hysteria may be useful in understanding the obsessive activity. Although hysteria has been culturally connected to the female body, Lacan described hysteria as gender confusion. The hysteric is confused as to his/her gendered subjectivity in relation to the phallic order. The bodybuilder, like the hysteric, seeks a complete rejection of the body, owing to a lack, in his history, of symbolization of the body. Therefore the bodybuilder dreams of an autotelic body and this causes erotogenic zone displacements and the resulting <b>auto-eroticism</b> of extreme, male bodybuilding...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} considers masturbation {{as a kind}} {{of reading}} practice in which the responsibility [...] or response-ability [...] of the reader becomes a concern. This concern of the masturbating reader, I argue, emerges in the eighteenth century with the post-Kantian notion of aesthetic education. The conceit of this project, then, is not only that "masturbation" and "aesthetics" emerge at the same time, but that these discourses [...] and the practices they entail [...] mutually (de) constitute each other. As structured around "perverse" moments in the history of media technics [...] i. e., from the hands-on readers of books, to the embodied spectators of movies, to the digital manipulation of vibrator users [...] this project thus attempts to defamiliarize (and queer) present notions of "interactivity" by focusing on the "masturbatory response" at the heart of "aesthetics. " Unlike other accounts of the rise of aesthetics, however, this project tries not to be just another repression-sublimation narrative. Aesthetic education, I argue, does not repress masturbation. Rather than saying "No" ("You can't"), aesthetic education is post-Kantian (or post-Can't-ian) in its repeated attempts to normalize a self-legislating (auto-nomous) being through practices of response-ability in which readers are incited to "express themselves" and "their feelings. " In my first section, therefore, I read Kant and Schiller through scenes of aroused book-reading dramatized in the texts of Franz Kafka, James Joyce, and Jean Genet, where the (im) possibility of taking responsibility for "one's own" response-ability is played out between notions of auto-nomy and auto-maticity.; I then move to one of the first texts of film aesthetics, Hugo Münsterberg's The Photoplay (1916), where the mimetic response-ability of the masturbating hand deconstructs notions of autotelic cinema. In my final section, I consider the electromechanical vibrator as a vehicle of auto-nomous (female) <b>auto-eroticism</b> in the Women's Liberation Movement, where the question of <b>auto-eroticism</b> as a (political) "auto-motive" is raised only to be resignified in the work of David Cronenberg's Crash. In aesthetic education, as Schiller says, the question, indeed, is that of "man" (the human, the human hand, and the humanities) and its heteronomous other(s) : "technicity," "writing," "addiction," "animality," "mimicry," "femininity," "prosthesis. " These keywords, then, constitute the constellation of this dissertation and its reading of the bio-politics of "aesthetics. ...|$|E
40|$|According to Kant the {{aesthetic}} judgment, {{insofar as it}} is concerned only with the harmony of the faculties, and a certain pleasure resulting from the conformity of nature with their own methods of binding space, is purely subjective. The affective element of the experience can be disregarded since it provides only the raw materials for the judgment which ignites one’s <b>auto-eroticism.</b> One must be disinterested – that is, one must not be among things (inter esse). The disinterest which accompanies the experience of beauty, however, has a significance beyond this subjective pleasure; for it constitutes man’s dignity, and thus his eminence over that which he surveys: ‘In the kingdom of ends everything has a price or dignity. Whatever has a price can be replaced by something else as its equivalent; on the other hand, whatever is above all price, and therefore admits of no equivalent, has a dignity. ’ [Kant GMM] We already know where this other hand is – it is the impossible same of reason’s double pincer – {{the expression of the}} ambidextrous specularisation and de(corpo) realization of the body [Irigarar...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective: To analyze {{factors that}} {{interfere}} with the exercise of sexuality among the elderly. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 235 elderly persons enrolled at the Open University of the Third Age of the Federal University of Pernambuco was carried out. The dependent variable was the exercise of sexuality, which was investigated in terms of perception of sexuality, thinking about sex, what the elderly person does {{when he or she}} has the desire for sex, sexual activity and <b>auto-eroticism.</b> The independent variables were sociodemographic data, health status and self-perception of body image. Statistical analysis involved bivariate correlation by the Kendall and Spearman coefficients. All variables with p&# 8804; 0. 20 in bivariate analysis were included in the generalized linear regression, with p= 0. 05 considered for the rejection of the null hypothesis. Result: The conception of sexuality was most closely related to genitality (67. 2 %), 51. 5 % of the sample reported thinking about sex, while 71. 1 % of the elderly persons said they were indifferent to sexual desire; 32. 3 % claimed to be sexually active; and 23 % auto-eroticized. The variables age, years of education, religion, physical exercise and dissatisfaction with body image were significant in bivariate correlation analysis. The desire for sex and sexual activity {{were less likely to be}} present among elderly persons who performed exercise. Conclusion: The sexuality of the elderly is based on several factors that may interfere with their experience and should be considered in educational strategies employed by health professionals who promote actions for the sexual health of the elderly...|$|E
40|$|Through a {{detailed}} analysis of two outstanding discourses on love: Plato's eros and Lacan's desire, this thesis studies the narratives of desire in Shakespeare's poetry. My reading of Shakespeare's poetry is an interpretation of three major themes of procreation, sublimation, and idealisation that not only reflect the discourse of desire but also establish its formulation. In each chapter a tradition of the theme has been respectively incorporated to demonstrate its context. Part I (Chapters One to Three) reveals Plato's concept of eros in terms of logocentricism and its egocentric nature. Part II (Chapters Four to Seven) concentrates on the cause, nature and object of desire from Lacan's perspective.;In Part III, Chapter Eight focuses on the metaphor of procreation as an egocentric desire that creates the irrevocable mark of loss. Through the act of regeneration, the lower not only establishes the beloved as an other but also denies any sense of unity. In Chapter Nine, the paradoxical nature of sublimation demonstrates a mode of <b>auto-eroticism</b> that constitutes desire as a metonymy of want-to-be. By elevating the beloved, the lover maintains his transcendence. Finally, Chapter Ten explores the unrepresentability of beauty and the inexpressibility of desire in the movement of idealisation. The dematerialisation of the beloved presents an iconic image of her and the language of desire, like the language of hieroglyphics, becomes indecipherable. Accordingly, the image of death in Shakespeare's poetry characterises the impossibility of desire. In a concluding chapter, I demonstrate how Shakespeare's lover in articulation of his desire, faces a dilemma...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: If teens {{options are}} experimenting sexualized practices, we should {{facilitate}} their knowledge, make them {{aware of their}} choices and help them living their sexuality in a safer mode. Objectives: To identify adolescents sexual practices; characterize the attitudes of teenagers {{against the use of}} contraception. Methods: quantitative research with exploratory nature. We studied a convenience sample of 301 adolescents of both sexes whitch attend the 9 th grade. Sexual practices and attitudes towards the use of contraception were assessed by "Contraceptive Attitude Scale" (CAS) Kyes (sd). Statistical analysis using SPSS- 19, we used measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, mean difference tests One-way ANOVA. Results: The presence of young people with sexual experience. The petting is used by the majority (62. 2 %), the practice of coitus are at 19. 6 % and <b>auto-eroticism</b> is denied by the majority (56. 8 %), while 43. 2 % report that their practice. For the petting and considering the sex of the subjects, there are some significant differences : (U (299) = 8004, Z = - 4. 14, p <. 05) and the same occurs in the autoeroticism (U (299) = 1899 Z = - 13. 56, p <. 05), in the intercourse in sexually active, there are no significant differences (U (299) = 10650. 5, Z = -. 233, p =. 816). The consistent use of contraception is approximately (50. 8 %) to the inconsistent use (49. 2 %), with no differences according to the gender of the subjects (U (59) = 325. 5, Z = - 1523, p =. 128) Conclusions: Alentejo region is considered as problematic in what concerns to our sample of adolescent motherhood and the risky practices coitu...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} how selected texts by J. G. Ballard—Crash (1973), Concrete Island (1974) and High‐Rise 1975) —and Kurt Vonnegut—Player Piano (1952), Slaughterhouse‐Five(1969) and Galápagos (1985) —can {{be considered in}} terms of theoretical stances derived from posthumanism. By analysing representations of the ‘human’ in relation to both the ‘machine’ and the ‘evolutionary human animal’, this thesis illustrates {{the emergence of the}} posthuman subject. In addition, by recognising the intersection between posthumanism and evolutionary theory, a wider project of this thesis involves demonstrating how the use of various theoretical approaches, from the ‘humanities’ and the ‘sciences’, contributes to the formation of a ‘posthumanities’ approach to literature. J. G. Ballard and Kurt Vonnegut consistently present fictional scenarios in which the lines between ‘human’, ‘machine’ and ‘evolutionary animal’ are disrupted and blurred. Depictions assume various triangulations and configurations: from the protagonist Ballard’s <b>auto‐eroticism,</b> to the characters of High‐Rise conflating boundaries between the ‘human’ and the evolutionary animal that is conveyed as a constituent of human identity, as well as between the machinic environment and the human inhabitant. Further,comparable configurations characterise Vonnegut’s texts: Player Piano’s Paul Proteus’ war against the machine is superimposed by human affiliation with the machine, and the castaway characters of Galápagos are stranded by evolutionary forces that displace human authority and control to the uttermost limit. Each of these instances contributes to the effective intervention of posthumanist thinking when reading the texts. In addition, the utilisation of evolutionary concepts derived from contemporaneous publications circulating in the cultural and scientific sphere highlights the usefulness of acknowledging sources from beyond the remit of traditional literary studies’ methodologies when reading texts. The triangulation between literature, posthumanism and evolutionary theory results in a reconfigured methodological approach to fictional texts: the posthumanities...|$|E
