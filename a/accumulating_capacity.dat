Bromeliad species from diverse So Paulo State conservation units, Brazil, were sampled for young, mature and old leaves using a sustainable sampling method. By applying INAA, the accumulation of ten chemical elements, i. e. Br, Ca, Co, Fe, K, Na, Rb, Sc, Sr and Zn, was investigated in different leaf vegetative stages. The bromeliads showed divergent chemical element distribution patterns, demonstrating a real complexity in the accumulation and translocation mechanisms utilized by these plants.

Field survey showed that Chinese brake had large <b>accumulating</b> <b>capacity</b> to arsenic; the orders of arsenic content {{in different parts of}} the fern were as follows: leaves>leafstalks>roots, which is totally different from that of ordinary plants; bioaccamulation coefficients of the above ground parts of the fern decreased as a power function of soil arsenic contents. In the control of pot trials with normal unpolluted soil containing 9 mg/kg of arsenic, the bioaccumulation coefficients of the above ground parts and rhizoids of Chinese brake were as high as 71 and 80 respectively. Greenhouse cultivation in the contaminated soil from mining areas has shown that more than 1 times greater arsenic can be accumulated in the leaves of the fern than that of field samples with the largest content of 5070 mg/kg As on a dry matter basis. During greenhouse cultivation, arsenic content in the leaves of the fern increased linearly with time prolonging. Not only has Chinese brake extraordinary tolerance and accumulation to arsenic, but it grew rapidly with great biomass, wide distribution and easy adaptation to different environmental conditions as well. Therefore, it has great potential in future remediation of arsenic contamination. It also demonstrates important value for studies of arsenic physiology and biochemistry such as arsenic absorption, translocation and detoxification mechanisms in plants...|$|E

40|$|In many {{mining regions}} of the world, {{pollution}} of surface water and groundwater by drainage water originating from mines aiming waste poses either {{a serious threat to}} the environment, or a severe environmental problem. During the last two and a half decades, treatment of mine drainage water in constructed and natural wetlands has emerged as an alternative to more conventional methods to handle the problem. In this thesis, the major biogeochemical processes behind metal immobilization in wetlands are summarized. Factors that influence the efficiency and longevity of these processes are discussed based on a review of previous experiences from wetlands exposed to mine drainage waters. The potential for successful treatment is largely determined by the characteristics of the drainage, the morphology of the wetland, and the degree of maintenance planned. In maintenance-free wetland, factors that have to be considered include: changes in drainage water production and wetland performance over the years, the total metal <b>accumulating</b> <b>capacity</b> of the wetland, and the post treatment integrity of the wetland. Results from a case study indicated that no or little immobilization of metals occured in natural wetlands situated along a mining region recipient (the river Vormbäcken, northern Sweden). However, Fe supplied from the catchment area appeared to favor the fraction of As, Cu, and Pb recovered in particles, a mechanism that could be of interest for the polishing of treated mine drainage waters, especially when combined with settling in a downstream wetland. Laboratory experiments showed that such a process is likely to be favored by addition of Fe in its ferrous form, higher water temperatures, presence of Ca, and absence of dissolved organic matter...|$|E

40|$|According {{to modern}} data, about 80 % of the {{population}} living in different countries, receives magnesium in insufficient quantities. The lack of magnesium adversely affects {{the functions of the}} central nervous system, heart and blood vessels, adrenals, thyroid and pancreas, and other organs. The magnesium deficiency increases with the age of the person. Its content is not enough in the diet of the elderly and poorly provided people. The purpose of the research was to study the possibility of enriching of berries with magnesium enriched berries of various crops by the method of foliar treatment of plants during the formation of berries. The objects of research were the berries of the honeysuckle variety of Zimorodok, the strawberry variety of the Korona, the variegated–leaf hardy kiwi variety of Soroka. Enrichment was carried out by the method of single root foliar treatment of plants with an aqueous solution of magnesium sulphate of various concentrations in variants of the experiment with the addition of hydrated lime {{in order to avoid the}} burning of plants. The rate of consumption of the solution depended on the number of plants per hectare and the age of plantations. Control samples were sprayed with distilled water. The magnesium content in the berries was determined in accordance with GOST R 51429 - 99. The results obtained in the first years of the study allowed to determine the optimal concentration of the solution used to enrich the berries with magnesium, which was 20. 0 g/l. The use of this method of enrichment showed a positive tendency of magnesium accumulation by plants. The magnesium content in berries increases, while the following regularity was observed: an increase in the concentration of the solution in the variants of the experiment contributed to its greater content in the berries. The results of further studies prove the possibility of increasing the natural content of magnesium in honeysuckle, strawberry and variegated–leaf hardy kiwi in 1. 7 – 6. 3 times. According to the ability to accumulate magnesium, honeysuckle leads — 626. 5 % in relation to control. In the strawberries, magnesium accumulates to a somewhat lesser extent — 308. 9 %. Variegated–leaf hardy kiwi berries are characterized by a high natural content of magnesium, but low <b>accumulating</b> <b>capacity</b> of its accumulation is 172. 1 % on average over three years of research.

40|$|Selenium (Se 34 _ 79) is a {{trace element}} of {{importance}} to the body. Its importance is related to its anti-oxidative capacity, and its involvement in the synthesis of thyroid hormones and selenoproteins. These selenoproteins and some selenium compounds such as methylselenol are involved in reducing the accumulation of free radicals and {{in the prevention of}} myopathies and some cancers. The presence of selenium in the body ensures correct functioning of the immune system. Studies showed that selenium deficiency reduces phagocytic capacity and cell mobility. The presence of selenium in the body also ensures healthy reproduction, in terms of spermatogenesis or in the prevention of mastitis and metritis in cows. There is, subsequently a reduction of negative economic impact of these anomalies in the farms. The recommended daily intake of selenium in animals varies according to species and the animal type from 100 to 300 µg/kg dry matter (DM). Nutritional selenium requirements in cattle are often not met by locally produced feedstuffs, owing to the very small selenium content. This is mainly due to the types of soils naturally poor in selenium, but also to the low selenium <b>accumulating</b> <b>capacity</b> of forages alone with the pedoclimatic conditions (soil pH and precipitations) which limit the selenium bioavailability in the soil. Consequently, the selenium intake in humans is not met. In Belgium, for example, the average daily intake of selenium is estimated to be between 28 and 60 µg, while the recommended amount by the High Council of Health is 60 µg / day for women and 70 µg / day for men. An additional selenium supplement in feedstuffs for beef and dairy cattle may help to maintain the selenium status, improve cattle health and finally to increase the selenium content in meat and milk. Subsequently, this will help to ensure an adequate selenium supply in humans. The aim of this present research was to assess the effects of a dietary selenium supply in fattening Belgian Blue bulls. The strategy consisted in incorporating in the bulls feed cereals produced with selenium-enriched fertilizers. Instead of the usual addition of sodium selenite and selenized yeasts used as selenium supply, the present enrichment technique follows the soil-plant-animal axis. It aimed primarily to ensure an adequate dietary selenium intake in Belgian Blue bulls, with as effects, a bio fortification of meat in selenium. The first part of the present work is a review paper entitled “Selenium in the Environment, Metabolism and Involvement in Body Functions”. It reports key findings on selenium, its physicochemical properties, its production and presence in the environment, its implication into the organism and effects of its deficiencies in humans and animals. This first study is followed by a second review paper entitled “Selenium in cattle”. It focuses on the effects of selenium deficiency and supplementation in the bovine species (bull, cow and calf). It is thus a synthesis of current understanding about on selenium in cattle. The aim was to review the effects of selenium deficiency and selenium supplementation on growth, on reproduction and on the beef products mainly meat and milk. The experimental part of this work began with an epidemiological study on selenium status in cattle herds in Wallonia. The objective {{of this study was to}} provide an overview on/of the blood selenium content in/of cattle in Wallonia. The selenium content was evaluated through the measurement of glutathione peroxidase activity in red blood cells. Data were available on 114 heifers and 184 cows (82 dairy cows and 102 beef cows) distributed over 66 farms in Wallonia. Four agricultural regions were involved in this study namely, the Limoneuse region, the Condroz, the Ardennes and the Famenne region. It appeared from the study that 87 % of cattle herds in Wallonia presented a marginal or severe deficiency in selenium (81 µg/L). The lowest selenium status was recorded in the Ardennes region. The average selenium contents recorded in the Ardennes were 34 µg / L in heifers, 44 µg / L in dairy cows and 32 µg /L in beef cows. Compared to other agricultural regions, the highest contents of selenium in dairy cows (64 µg /L) and a beef cow (55 µg/L) were recorded respectively in the Limoneuse Region and in Famenne. The selenium content in beef herds was lower compared to dairy herds (35 vs 56 µg / L, p < 0. 01). The selenium deficiency could be a determining factor in increasing of frequency of mastitis, metritis and myopathies. Selenium deficiency can be prevented either by selenium dietary supplementation and selenium injections in deficient animals. The use of selenized fertilizers and selenium-enriched ingredients or feedstuffs with high selenium content has been shown to help correct deficiencies observed in cattle. Similar effects can be expected all over Belgium and in countries in which selenium deficiencies have been reported. “Meat composition and quality of young growing Belgian Blue bulls offered a fattening diet with selenium enriched cereals” was the second research of the experimental part of the present work. It consisted to feed growing fattening bulls diet in which spelt and barley were enriched in selenium. The selenium enrichment of the two cereals was obtained by a particular culture technique. The cereals were grown with fertilizers containing sodium selenate. An amount of 4 g of selenate was applied per hectare. These cereals were introduced in the experimental feedstuffs used in the feeding of the fattening Belgian Blue bulls. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effects of the use of these selenium fortified cereals on growth performance, quality and chemical composition of meat. A total of 23 young bulls were used. Twelve bulls received a control diet containing selenium at a rate of 58 µg/kg DM and the 11 others received a diet with selenium at 173 µg/kg DM. The results of this experiment indicated that the selenium enrichment of diet had no significant effect on growth performance. The final live weight gain, average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio were similar in both groups. Slaughter data were not influenced either by the addition of selenium. Since the carcass weight, yield, shrinkage and the percentage of muscles were similar in both groups. The meat quality measured by the pH drop, by color, by oxidative rancidity and by water loss was not affected by the addition of selenium. Similarly, in terms of chemical composition of meat, dry matter and protein content were not significantly affected. However, significant effects were recorded on the ether extract content (2. 1 vs 1. 7 % DM, p < 0. 05) of meat. The selenium content increased significantly in the plasma (31 vs. 66 ng/ml, p < 0. 001) and in the Longissimus thoracis muscle (177 vs. 477 ng/g DM, p< 0. 001). A high increase of selenium was also recorded in the organs: liver (474 vs. 1126 ng/g DM), kidneys (4956 vs. 5655 ng/g DM) and testes (2070 vs. 2309 ng/g DM). The use of selenium-enriched cereals appeared to be a good method of supplementing selenium in fattening bulls. Such a method of supplementation did not alter the physical and chemical qualities of the meat and induced a decrease in the fat content of meat. Furthermore, there were increased contents of selenium in the blood and organs of the bulls. The consumption of meat produced under such conditions would help to provide between 30 and 57 % of daily selenium requirements. In our knowledge, this method of supplementing selenium in cattle, in particular in Belgian Blue bulls, and selenium bio-fortification of meat, is original. The application of the technique used in the present work seems to be useful in helping to reduce selenium deficiency in regions and countries in which they are observed. A similar trial with different levels of selenium in the diet should be designed in order to test a "dose" effect on the same parameters as studied in this work. It would also be interesting in future to conduct a comparative study between the type of supplementation developed in this work and an addition of mineral and/or organic selenium in order to evaluate the "type and source of selenium" effects on the studied parameters. Finally, a technical and economical study should be undertaken to assess the cost of these selenium supplementation types...|$|E

Therefore, it is crucial to support the ability of urban communities to negotiate their needs and rights in order to increase the flexibility and inclusiveness of these systems and make them more viable in today’s context...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} a distributed {{power generation system}} that has evolved at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. The technological and field-related experience pertaining to open top re-burn down draft biomass gasification system coupled with {{the internal combustion engine}} or thermal device are brought out. The gasifier reactor design uses dual air entry – air nozzles and open top to help in establishing a thick high temperature zone to remove the contaminants in the product gas; a gas clean-up system to further refine the gas to ultra-pure quality. These elements are integrated with other sub-systems, namely feedstock preparation, ash handling, water treatment, process automation and other accessories to form an Independent Power Producer. Based on this technology there are over 30 units operating in India and abroad, with an <b>accumulated</b> <b>capacity</b> of over 20 MW. Over 80, 000 h of operation of these systems have resulted in a saving of about 350 tons of fossil fuel, implying a saving of about 1120 tons of $CO_{ 2 }$ – a promising candidate for Clean Development Mechanisms (CDMs),other than reduction in toxic gases like $NO_{x} and SO_{x}$...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} technological change and spillovers {{within the context of}} a climate policy in a long-term scenario of the global energy system. We use the energy-systems optimization model MESSAGE considering endogenous learning for various technologies, such that they experience cost reductions as a function of <b>accumulated</b> <b>capacity</b> installations. We find that the existence of technological learning while reducing overall energy system costs becomes particularly important in the context of a long-term climate policy. Diversity in technological portfolios is emphasized and results indicate deployment of a range of energy technologies in reducing emissions. An important finding is that technological learning by itself is not sufficient for climate stabilization and that climate policies are an absolute necessary complimentary element. Under a climate constraint, spillovers across technologies and regions due to learning results in increased upfront investments and hence lower costs of carbon free technologies, thus resulting in technology deployment and emissions reductions, especially in developing countries. We conclude that learning and spillover effects can lead to technologically advanced cost-effective global energy transition pathways. We suggest that coordinated climate stabilization policies can serve as important institutional mechanisms that facilitate the required technological investments, especially in developing countries and thus ensure long-term cost reductions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory on}} the green paradox has focused {{primarily}} on the consumption of a clean substitute produced using a static technology. In reality, we observe the gradual accumulation of the clean substitute’s capacity, suggesting that supply decisions for the clean substitute and finite carbon resource should both be treated as dynamic. This paper shows that when climate policy is preannounced, and with simultaneous consumption of a finite carbon resource and a clean substitute, myopia in the supply of the latter leads to the green paradox. When clean substitute producers can <b>accumulate</b> <b>capacity</b> and are forward looking, the green paradox {{may or may not}} arise, however. In this setting, its occurrence depends on both the size of the discount rate and the remaining stock of carbon resource. These and other drivers of the green paradox are investigated in a multi-producer game-theoretic model calibrated to real-world global oil market data. The timing of mandating policy is shown to be the single most important variable for mitigating the green paradox. Moreover, for EU- 2020 and US- 2022 style biofuel mandating targets, a rather robust 0. 3 % decline in production is observed during the premandate phase, suggesting that concerns over the green paradox may be seriously overstated...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} populations affected by war and other disasters makes a revised {{understanding of human}} resilience, now more than ever, a vital area of public and academic significance. As we enter the 21 st century, humankind will inevitably be faced {{with a series of}} traumas, many of which are as yet unimagined. To meet these challenges, we, as a global collective, will need to develop specific capacities and resources for coping, enduring, innovating, and creating hope, all of which are involved in the formation of resilience. This book explores the unique, unexpected and life-affirming ways that young Sudanese refugees in Western Sydney have responded to a particular kind of adversity and how their <b>accumulated</b> <b>capacities</b> of resilience has contributed to their ability to settle effectively in Australia. Critiquing the early psychological discourse on resilience that defines the phenomenon largely as an individual trait or set of behaviours, this book highlights the dialogical interaction between the individual and the social aspects of resilience. After Survival investigates the formation of resilience in the everyday lives of young Sudanese men and women in contemporary Australia. The book's critical interdisciplinary approach to the question of resilience will appeal to an international market and have far-reaching implications for the ways in which resilience is hereafter conceived. If resilience can be accumulated {{at the level of the}} individual it follows that it can be accumulated as a form of capital at the communal, national, and international levels in very real and meaningful ways. 154 page(s...|$|R
