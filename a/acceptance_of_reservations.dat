We {{find that in}} a reserved constituency, where only members of the disadvantaged castes can stand for election, voters of the disadvantaged castes are encouraged to vote. On the other hand, the system <b>of</b> constituency <b>reservation</b> {{does not have any}} impact on the turnout of voters belonging to other groups, including relatively upper caste voters. These voters, however, tend to change political party to vote for in reserved constituencies.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{question}} of the legality <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> to international human rights treaties. The evolution <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> law demonstrates that the system seek to promote universal adherence to multilateral treaties through flexible rules that reflects the superiority of national sovereignty in the international society. However, the flexibility <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> law as codified in the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties has facilitated wide <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> multilateral treaties at the cost of their integrity. In the case of human rights treaties, this issue is of paramount importance considering the essentiality of a balance between integrity and universality for human rights norms. There is an urgent necessity to promote adequate reforms of the Vienna Convention system and rely on human rights treaty bodies’ competence and jurisdiction to review the validity <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> and ensure that universality and integrity are equally respected...|$|R
40|$|The essay {{concerns}} the reservations {{attached to the}} declarations accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the two International Courts. As early as during the 1920 s when States consented to the compulsory jurisdicition of the first World Court they attached limitations on, conditions or reservations to their declarations <b>of</b> <b>acceptance.</b> For these declarations, there were no rules whatever prescribing any sort of uniformity or similarity of content in any aspects, and States formulated more and more complicated restrictions to their declarations <b>of</b> <b>acceptance.</b> After the International Court of Justice had been established, States continued the practice <b>of</b> attaching <b>reservations</b> to declarations <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> and, moreover, increased the number thereof, “inventing” more and more complicated reservations. Quite a few <b>of</b> such <b>reservations</b> placed much more limitations on the Court's compulsory jurisdiction than the interwar declarations <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> had done and a no small part of them left loopholes of escape from the jurisdiction recognized. In analysing the problems <b>of</b> permissible <b>reservations,</b> the author refers to the rules and criterias developed in international treaty law on the reservations to multilateral treaties and to the jurisprudence of the two Word Courts. She concludes that the declarations <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> are unilateral acts and the States are free to attach any reservation to their declarations <b>of</b> <b>acceptance.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Reservation {{policy is}} an {{extremely}} contentious topic in Indian politics. Proponents claim that a policy of positive discrimination {{is the only way}} to rectify the past injus-tices against India’s poor. Opponents claim that reservation policy creates perverse incentives that strengthen traditional caste boundaries and encourage backwardness. Despite vocal advocates on both sides of the issue, there is little empirical data on the actual effects <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> policy. This thesis provides theoretical and quantitative evidence on the unintended consequences <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> policy. I develop and estimate a model of marriage choice in the presence <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> to determine the effects <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> on the persistence of caste identity. I conclude that different effects <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> encourage both exogamy and endogamy along different dimensions, but the net impact <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> policy favors exogamy. iii ACKNOWLEDGMENT...|$|R
