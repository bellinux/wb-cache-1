5|$|As {{the reigning}} {{champions of the}} UEFA Champions League, Manchester United began their title defence <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> stage, {{for which they were}} given the top seed. This {{position}} amongst the top eight European clubs meant that they would avoid drawing former European champions Barcelona, Internazionale and Real Madrid until at least the first knockout round, although they were {{faced with the prospect of}} drawing Bayern Munich or Roma. Nevertheless, United ended up being drawn into Group E with two teams they had played against before: Villarreal (whom they had drawn in 2005–06) and Celtic (2006–07); and one they had not: Aalborg BK.|$|E
5|$|By {{a narrow}} margin, Scotland {{qualified}} for the UEFA European Championship {{for the first time}} in 1992. A 1–0 defeat by Romania away from home left qualification dependent upon other results, but a 1–1 draw between Bulgaria and Romania in the final group match saw Scotland squeeze through. Despite playing well in matches against the Netherlands and Germany and a fine win against the CIS, the team was knocked out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> stage. Scotland failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The team finished fourth in their qualifying group behind Italy, Switzerland and Portugal. When it became clear that Scotland could not qualify, Andy Roxburgh resigned from his position as team manager.|$|E
5|$|However, in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, England {{lost two}} {{consecutive}} group matches, against Italy and Uruguay, by 2–1 on each occasion. This {{was the first}} time England had lost two group matches since the 1950 World Cup (when they lost against the United States and Spain) and the first time England had been eliminated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> stage since the 1958 World Cup. This was also the first time that England had not won a match at the tournament since 1958, and England's points total of one from three matches was its worst ever in the World Cup.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool {{qualified}} for the knockout phase of the 2012–13 Europa League after winning their group <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> stage, but were eliminated from the competition at the round of 32 by Zenit Saint Petersburg on the away goals rule after a 0–2 loss away and a 3–1 win at home. A seventh-place finish in the 2012–13 Premier League and a failure to secure qualification via domestic cups meant Liverpool failed to qualify for any European competition in the 2013–14 season. A second-placed finish in the 2013–14 Premier League, ensured Liverpool {{qualified for}} the group stage of the 2014–15 Champions League. One win out of six in the group stage meant they were eliminated and entered into the knockout phase of the 2014–15 Europa League. The campaign was short-lived, as Liverpool eliminated by Beşiktaş in the round of 32.|$|E
5|$|Success {{finally arrived}} during the 2001–02 season. Arsenal {{finished}} seven points above Liverpool {{to win the}} Premier League title, and defeated Chelsea 2–0 in the FA Cup Final. Henry became the league's top goalscorer and netted 32 goals in all competitions as he led Arsenal to a double and his first silverware with the club. There was much expectation that Henry would replicate his club form for France during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but the defending champions suffered a shock exit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> stage.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 defence {{of the cup}} in France {{got off to a}} {{very poor}} start, with a below par victory over the United States and a heavy 36–0 defeat to South Africa leaving the holders on the brink of {{elimination}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> stage. Improved performances against Samoa and Tonga saw England again reach the knockout stages as pool runners-up, before a surprise 12–10 defeat of Australia in Marseille and a narrow 14–9 victory over the host nation France carried England to a second successive final appearance. The final was played in Paris on 20 October against South Africa, who won by 15 points to 6.|$|E
5|$|The US Open 2014 saw the Big Four's {{collective}} grip on {{the major}} titles slip still further, however, as Kei Nishikori and Marin Čilić beat Djokovic and Federer in the semi-finals respectively to contest the first Slam final featuring none of the Big Four since the 2005 Australian Open, {{and the first time}} since 2003 that multiple first-time Grand Slam tournament winners have been crowned in a single season. Following the tournament, Murray dropped to 11th in the rankings, his first time outside the top 10 since 2008. The tournament as a whole further signalled the decline of the Big Four's dominance. Towards the end of the year, Andy Murray managed to return to form, winning three titles in Shenzhen, Vienna and Valencia, allowing him to return to the top ten in the rankings and qualify for the Tour Finals, but he bowed out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> stages following a humiliating defeat by Federer, in which he won just a single game. Indeed, throughout the year Murray failed to register a single victory against another member of the Big Four in nine meetings.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season City {{failed to}} capitalise on the gains {{made in the}} first two full seasons of Mancini's reign. While City rarely seemed likely to drop below second in the table, they posed little title challenge all season. In the Champions League, the club was eliminated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> stage for a second successive season, while a second FA Cup final in three seasons ended in a 1–0 defeat to relegated Wigan Athletic. Mancini was dismissed two days later, ostensibly as he had failed to reach his targets for the season, but BBC Sports Editor David Bond reported he had been sacked for his poor communication and relationships with players and executives. In his place was appointed the Chilean Manuel Pellegrini. In Pellegrini's first season, City won the League Cup and regained the Premier League title {{on the last day of}} the season.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} seasons were comparatively barren. Arsenal again {{exited the}} Champions League <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> stage, but dropped {{down to the}} UEFA Cup. Wenger guided his team to the final, where they lost to Galatasaray on penalties. In the league, Arsenal finished 18 points behind Manchester United as runners-up, and though they closed the gap to eight points in 2000–01, they never posed a serious title challenge. The trophy drought continued past 2001, when Michael Owen scored two late goals for Liverpool to beat Arsenal in the FA Cup Final. Wenger rued his team's inability to make possession count, but refused to blame individuals, namely Henry, for missing chances.|$|E
5|$|The two {{consecutive}} losses, Brazil's first consecutive home defeats since 1940, led to coach Luiz Felipe Scolari's resignation on 15 July. Two weeks later, the Brazilian Football Confederation brought back Dunga {{as head coach}} of the Brazil national team. He had managed the team from 2006 until 2010, being dismissed following a 2–1 loss to the Netherlands in the 2010 FIFA World Cup quarter-finals. He was dismissed for a second time, however, following Brazil crashing out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> stage of the Copa América Centenario in the United States two years later.|$|E
5|$|With Yahya Alwan {{as their}} manager, Al-Talaba {{had one of}} the worst seasons in their history in the 2010–11 Iraqi Premier League, {{finishing}} the season in eighth place of the Southern group with 38 points, only one point away from relegation, with nine wins, eleven draws, and six losses. In the 2011 AFC Cup, Al-Talaba finished in third place in their group with five points, having won one match, drew two, and lost three, therefore they were knocked out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> stage. In the 2011–12 Iraqi Premier League, Al-Talaba with Jamal Ali, Khalaf Hassan, and Karim Salman as their consecutive managers, finished the season in fourth place with 68 points, winning in 19 matches, drawing in 11, and losing in eight.|$|E

5|$|On 28September2000, then-opposition {{leader of}} Israel Ariel Sharon {{and members of}} the Likud Party, along with 1,000 armed guards, visited the al-Aqsa compound; a large group of Palestinians went to protest the visit. After Sharon and the Likud Party members left, a {{demonstration}} erupted and Palestinians {{on the grounds of the}} Haram al-Sharif began throwing stones and other projectiles at Israeli riot police. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowd, injuring 24 people. The visit sparked a five-year uprising by the Palestinians, commonly referred to as the al-Aqsa Intifada, though some commentators, citing subsequent speeches by PA officials, particularly Imad Falouji and Arafat himself, claim that the Intifada had been planned months in advance, as early as July upon Yasser Arafat's return from Camp David talks. On 29September, the Israeli government deployed 2,000 riot police to the mosque. When a group of Palestinians left the mosque after Friday prayers (Jumu'ah,) they hurled stones at the police. The police then stormed the mosque compound, firing both live ammunition and rubber bullets <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> of Palestinians, killing four and wounding about 200.|$|E
