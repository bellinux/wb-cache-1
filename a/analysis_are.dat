5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of various eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct Suillus species revealed that S.sibiricus forms a well-supported clade with S.americanus and S.umbonatus; these relationships are corroborated by a previous analysis (1996), which used a larger sampling of Suillus species to determine taxonomic {{relationships in the}} genus. Within this clade, S.umbonatus and U.S. S.sibiricus can {{be separated from the}} rest of the group. However, the phylogenetic relationships among the tested isolates determined from different methods of <b>analysis</b> <b>are</b> not always consistent and could not be established with confidence. In general, there is little phylogenetic divergence detected in this clade.|$|E
5|$|Centers {{of surface}} high- and {{low-pressure}} {{areas that are}} found within closed isobars on a surface weather <b>analysis</b> <b>are</b> the absolute maxima and minima in the pressure field, and can tell a user in a glance what the general weather is in their vicinity.

30|$|One way to {{deal with}} characterizing privacy with regards to data <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> to require that the analyst does not know not any more about any {{individual}} in the data set after the <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> completed than she knew before the <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> begun.|$|R
5|$|Tapaculos are {{the most}} {{primitive}} family of suboscines, divided into 12 genera containing 60 species. Scytalopus, the genus to which the Perijá tapaculo belongs, has an abundance of similar species, {{many of which are}} difficult to classify through appearance. Some individual species from other genera are like Scytalopus in size and plumage, but have different behaviour and morphological features. Vocal studies and mitochondrial DNA <b>analysis</b> <b>are</b> often used to differentiate between species within the genus; a number of visually identical species previously classified as subspecies of the Magellanic tapaculo (S. magellanicus) have been identified through these methods, and the majority of subspecies within the genus have subsequently been reclassified as separate species.|$|E
25|$|The {{behaviors}} {{impacted by}} behavior <b>analysis</b> <b>are</b> largely determined by learning {{and controlled by}} manipulable aspects of the environment.|$|E

25|$|The {{completeness}} {{property of}} the reals is the basis on which calculus, and, more generally mathematical <b>analysis</b> <b>are</b> built.

50|$|The {{unrestricted}} race model {{states that}} <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> affected {{prior to the}} introduction of ambiguity and affects which meaning is adopted (based on probability) before multiple analyses are able to be introduced. Van Gompel and Pickering refer to the unrestricted race model explicitly as a two-stage reanalysis model. In contrast to constraint-based theories, only one <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> constructed at a time.
