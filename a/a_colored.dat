50|$|<b>A</b> <b>color</b> solid is the {{three-dimensional}} representation of <b>a</b> <b>color</b> model, <b>an</b> analog of the two-dimensional color wheel. The added spatial dimension allows <b>a</b> <b>color</b> solid to depict an added dimension of <b>color</b> variation. Whereas <b>a</b> two-dimensional <b>color</b> wheel typically depicts {{the variables of}} hue (red, green, blue, etc.) and brightness (gradations of light and dark), <b>a</b> <b>color</b> solid adds the variable of saturation, allowing the sphere to depict all conceivable <b>colors</b> in <b>an</b> organized three-dimensional structure.|$|R
50|$|In <b>color</b> theory, <b>a</b> tint is {{the mixture}} of <b>a</b> <b>color</b> with white, which {{increases}} lightness, and a shade is {{the mixture of}} <b>a</b> <b>color</b> with black, which reduces lightness. A tone is produced either by the mixture of <b>a</b> <b>color</b> with gray, or by both tinting and shading. Mixing <b>a</b> <b>color</b> with any neutral color (including black, gray and white) reduces the chroma, or colorfulness, while the hue remains unchanged.|$|R
5|$|Bubble lights, {{a type of}} {{incandescent}} novelty light, {{were invented}} by Carl Otis in 1935, who then sold the patents to the NOMA (National Outfit Manufacturer's Association) Electric Corporation. NOMA launched the novelty lights on the Christmas market in 1946 when war shortages ended. Bubble lights became hugely popular. Their main feature was a sealed glass tube with <b>a</b> <b>colored</b> bubbling liquid inside.|$|E
5|$|Palatography {{involves}} {{the painting of}} <b>a</b> <b>colored</b> substance onto the tongue which is then transferred onto the palate during articulation. A picture is then taken of the palate to record the location of contact and, if another palatogram is to be taken, the mouth is washed out and the tongue repainted. A particularly low cost method that is often used in fieldwork, {{it can be difficult}} to collect large amounts of data.|$|E
5|$|Some critics {{consider}} Balzac's writing exemplary of naturalism—a more pessimistic {{and analytical}} form of realism, {{which seeks to}} explain human behavior as intrinsically linked with the environment. French novelist Émile Zola declared Balzac {{the father of the}} naturalist novel. Zola indicated that whilst the Romantics saw the world through <b>a</b> <b>colored</b> lens, the naturalist sees through a clear glass—precisely the sort of effect Balzac attempted to achieve in his works.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war in 1861, Johnston was fifteen years old and {{attending}} Highland Military College in Newburg, New York. He remained in school through 1862, but then left to raise a company for a regiment being organized in New York. De Peyster's father paid ten-dollar bounties to the men who signed the muster roll of his company. He was not able to assume command because of his age, and his family also felt he was too young for service. However, in the winter of 1863, he threatened to travel to Washington, D.C. and stand for examination for an officership with <b>a</b> <b>colored</b> regiment.|$|E
5|$|The first 28 {{issues were}} 166 pages long. The page count dropped to 134 with the April 1954 issue and stayed at that length for the {{remainder}} of the run. The cover layout initially strongly resembled that of Other Worlds but was changed with the fifth issue, June 1951, to have a white background banner for the title. This format was retained for the rest of the magazine's life, with occasional slight variations such as using a different color for the banner background. The spine also changed from <b>a</b> <b>colored</b> spine with pale lettering, which was similar to the spine style used by Other Worlds, to a white spine with red or blue lettering.|$|E
5|$|Having {{left the}} others, Xavier {{returns to the}} safe room and finds <b>a</b> <b>colored</b> number {{on the back of}} Gus's neck. After realizing the answer to the clue, he kills Jonas with a spiked bat for his number after a brief fight and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent after finding the clue {{revealing}} Daniel's identity. Addison and Amanda abandon him, but Amanda returns after finding Jonas' body. Addison finds a glass box housing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which are lined with hidden blades, and Xavier leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room which leads to a dilapidated bathroom with two rotting corpses. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda notes that he can't read his own number, and he cuts the skin from his neck. As he approaches, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, jumps up and slashes his neck with a hacksaw, killing him.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>color</b> {{space is}} <b>a</b> {{specific}} organization of colors. In combination with physical device profiling, {{it allows for}} reproducible representations of color, in both analog and digital representations. <b>A</b> <b>color</b> space may be arbitrary, with particular <b>colors</b> assigned to <b>a</b> set of physical color swatches and corresponding assigned names or numbers such as with the Pantone collection, or structured mathematically, as with NCS System, Adobe RGB or sRGB. <b>A</b> <b>color</b> model is <b>an</b> abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers (e.g. triples in RGB or quadruples in CMYK); however, <b>a</b> <b>color</b> model with no associated mapping function to <b>an</b> absolute <b>color</b> space is <b>a</b> more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of <b>color</b> interpretation. Adding <b>a</b> specific mapping function between <b>a</b> <b>color</b> model and <b>a</b> reference <b>color</b> space establishes within the reference <b>color</b> space <b>a</b> definite [...] "footprint", known as a gamut, and for <b>a</b> given <b>color</b> model this defines <b>a</b> <b>color</b> space. For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB color model. When defining <b>a</b> <b>color</b> space, the usual reference standard is the CIELAB or CIEXYZ color spaces, which were specifically designed to encompass all colors the average human can see.|$|R

25|$|As used by fumigators {{to detect}} {{hydrogen}} cyanide, copper(II) salt and an aromatic amine such as benzidine {{is added to}} the sample; as an alternative to benzidine an alternative amine di-(4,4-bis-dimethylaminophenyl) methane can be used. A positive test gives a blue color. Copper(I) cyanide is poorly soluble. By sequestering the copper(I) the copper(II) is rendered a stronger oxidant. The copper, in a cyanide facilitated oxidation, converts the amine into <b>a</b> <b>colored</b> compound. The Nernst equation explains this process. Another good example of such chemistry {{is the way in which}} the saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) works. The copper, in a cyanide-facilitated oxidation, converts the amine into <b>a</b> <b>colored</b> compound.|$|E
5000|$|Testing whether <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> has <b>a</b> {{repetitive}} path is in NP, so testing whether <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> is nonrepetitive is in co-NP, and Manin {{showed that}} it is co-NP-complete. The problem of finding such <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> belongs to [...] in the polynomial hierarchy, and again Manin {{showed that it}} is complete for this level.|$|R
5000|$|Purple navy is <b>a</b> <b>color</b> {{that has}} been used by some navies. [...] "Purple navy" [...] in this color {{terminology}} usage is regarded as a shade of indigo, <b>a</b> <b>color</b> which can be regarded as a tone of purple when using the common English definition of purple, i.e., <b>a</b> <b>color</b> between blue and red.|$|R
50|$|Cornflower blue is <b>a</b> defined <b>color</b> in the X Window (X11) <b>color</b> scheme. <b>As</b> such, it is <b>a</b> <b>color</b> {{available}} as <b>a</b> named <b>color</b> for webpages.|$|R
25|$|Ninhydrin {{reacts with}} amino acids and amines to form <b>a</b> <b>colored</b> {{compound}} “Ruhemann’s purple” (RP). Spraying with a zinc chloride solution forms a 1:1 complex RP:ZnCl(H2O)2, {{which is more}} readily detected as it fluoresces better than Ruhemann’s purple.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>color</b> {{appearance}} model (abbreviated CAM) is {{a mathematical}} model that seeks to describe the perceptual aspects of human color vision, i.e. viewing conditions under which the appearance of <b>a</b> <b>color</b> does not tally with the corresponding physical measurement of the stimulus source. (In contrast, <b>a</b> <b>color</b> model defines <b>a</b> coordinate space to describe colors, such as the RGB and CMYK color models.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> {{tertiary}} <b>color</b> is <b>a</b> <b>color</b> made {{by mixing}} full saturation of one primary color with half saturation of another primary color {{and none of}} <b>a</b> third primary <b>color,</b> in <b>a</b> given <b>color</b> space such as RGB, CMYK (more modern) or RYB (traditional).|$|R
25|$|In 2007, Google Maps began {{offering}} traffic data in real-time, using <b>a</b> <b>colored</b> map overlay {{to display the}} speed of vehicles on particular roads.

50|$|While violet is {{the color}} of humility in the {{symbolism}} of the Catholic Church, it has exactly the opposite meaning in general society. A European poll in 2000 showed it was the color most commonly associated with vanity. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>color</b> that rarely exists in nature, and <b>a</b> <b>color</b> which by its nature attracts attention, it is seen as <b>a</b> <b>color</b> of individualism and extravagance.|$|R
50|$|Folly is <b>a</b> <b>color</b> {{one-fourth of}} the way between crimson and rose, closer to crimson than to rose. The first {{recorded}} use of folly as <b>a</b> <b>color</b> name in English was in 1920.|$|R
