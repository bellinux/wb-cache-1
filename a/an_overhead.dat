5|$|<b>An</b> <b>overhead</b> or {{penetration}} diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under <b>an</b> <b>overhead,</b> and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E
5|$|Another council plan {{during the}} 1960s was to {{separate}} pedestrians and traffic, {{and it was}} proposed that any new buildings in City Square would be built with <b>an</b> <b>overhead</b> walkway – this never came to fruition, with only a short section ever being built.|$|E
5|$|FireRed and LeafGreen {{are members}} of the Pokémon series of {{role-playing}} video games. As in previous games, the player controls the player character from <b>an</b> <b>overhead</b> perspective and participates in turn-based combat encounters. However, new features such as a contextual help menu and a new region the player may access have also been added. Throughout the games, the player captures and raises Pokémon for use in battle.|$|E

5|$|On 23 September 2009 <b>an</b> <b>overhead</b> {{power line}} dropped on to a Class 373 train {{arriving}} at St Pancras station, activating {{a circuit breaker}} and delaying eleven other trains. Two days later, on 25 September 2009, electrical power via the overhead lines was lost on a section of high-speed line outside Lille, delaying passengers on two evening Eurostar-operated services.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} 3D cel-shaded graphics with <b>an</b> <b>overhead</b> camera perspective, employs controls {{involving the}} console's touchscreen and microphone, and {{takes advantage of}} the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for online play. The game's story follows that of The Wind Waker, focusing on series protagonist Link's journey to save his friend Tetra from the story's antagonist, Bellum, with the help of Captain Linebeck and his ship, the S.S. Linebeck.|$|E
5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as <b>an</b> <b>overhead</b> kick or {{scissors}} kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E

5|$|Also {{known as}} a {{manifold}} cage or regulator cage, this is a structure which can be clamped to {{the neck of the}} cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect the valves and regulator first stages from impact and abrasion damage while in use and from rolling the valve closed by friction of the handwheel against <b>an</b> <b>overhead.</b> A valve cage is often made of stainless steel, and some designs can snag on obstructions.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the switch}} to 3D, the game is still played {{primarily}} from <b>an</b> <b>overhead</b> perspective similar to the original 2D Metal Gear games. However, the camera angle will change during certain situations, such as a corner view when Snake flattens himself to a wall next to an open space, or into first-person when crawling under tight spaces or using certain items such as the binoculars or a sniper rifle. The player can also use the first-person view while remaining idle to look around Snake's surroundings or see what's ahead of him.|$|E
5|$|Divers {{may carry}} one {{cylinder}} or multiples, {{depending on the}} requirements of the dive. Where diving takes place in low risk areas, where the diver may safely make a free ascent, or where a buddy is available to provide an alternative air supply in an emergency, recreational divers usually carry only one cylinder. Where diving risks are higher, for example where the visibility is low or when recreational divers do deeper or decompression diving, and particularly when diving under <b>an</b> <b>overhead,</b> divers routinely carry more than one gas source.|$|E

5|$|Dragon Quest VI is a traditional, turn-based {{role-playing}} {{video game}} (in <b>an</b> <b>overhead</b> perspective) which features random battles and a character class system that the Hero {{and his party}} members acquire new skills and spells. The Hero travels around the world gathering a party throughout his adventure. To progress in the story, the party must defeat specific boss monsters or trigger specific flags. In order to defeat the bosses, the player must spend time training the party by gaining experience points from battles to advance in character and class levels.|$|E
5|$|Over the Hedge is {{presented}} in full 3D on both of the Nintendo DS' screens, which is not often seen in a Nintendo DS game. The upper screen displays the game in an over-the-shoulder third person perspective, whereas the touch screen shows <b>an</b> <b>overhead</b> perspective. The lower screen indicates the sight range of enemies {{and can be used}} as a touch screen to target enemies to attack. The console's microphone is used to attract the attention of dogs or to rouse the woodland creatures should they be knocked unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Super Columbine Massacre RPG! is a {{role-playing}} video game. Players {{control the}} actions of teenagers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; the pair entered Colorado's Columbine High School on April 20, 1999 and killed 13 people before turning their guns on themselves in a library. Much of the game {{takes place in a}} third-person view, with players controlling Harris and Klebold from <b>an</b> <b>overhead</b> perspective. The graphics and characters are deliberately reminiscent of a 16-bit-era video game; while the content is violent, the violence is not graphically rendered.|$|E

5|$|The 767 {{interior}} introduced larger overhead bins {{and more}} lavatories per passenger than previous aircraft. The bins are wider to accommodate garment bags without folding, and strengthened for heavier carry-on items. A single, large galley is installed near the aft doors, allowing for more efficient meal service and simpler ground resupply. Passenger and service doors are <b>an</b> <b>overhead</b> plug type, which retract upwards, and commonly used doors can {{be equipped with}} an electric-assist system.|$|E
5|$|Upon Carey's {{death in}} March 1889, Avondale was {{inherited}} by his 16-year-old grand nephew William Herbert deLisle. deLisle arrived {{and took up}} residence there in 1893, and assumed the land title in 1894. Avondale had been a pastoral property until deLisle's arrival, {{over the next ten}} years sections of the estate were sold off to fund its development. During this period, the house was expanded and the stable built, which included 20 horse stalls with hollow walls and <b>an</b> <b>overhead</b> loft. The hollow walls enable feed from the loft to gravitate directly to the feed bins in each stall.|$|E
5|$|By the 5th century, {{structures}} with small-scale domed cross plans existed {{across the}} Christian world. Examples include the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, the martyrium {{attached to the}} Basilica of San Simpliciano, and churches in Macedonia and {{on the coast of}} Asia Minor. Small brick domes are also found in towers of Constantinople's early 5th century land walls. Underground cisterns in Constantinople, such as the Cistern of Philoxenos and the Basilica Cistern, were composed of a grid of columns supporting small domes, rather than groin vaults. The square bay with <b>an</b> <b>overhead</b> sail vault or dome on pendentives became the basic unit of architecture in the early Byzantine centuries, found in a variety of combinations.|$|E
