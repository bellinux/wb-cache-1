5000|$|In September 2011, three NASA {{investigators}} {{claimed that}} the tin whiskers they identified on the <b>Accelerator</b> <b>Position</b> <b>Sensors</b> of sampled models of Toyota Camry could contribute to the [...] "stuck accelerator" [...] crashes affecting certain Toyota models during 2005-2010. This contradicted an earlier 10-month joint investigation by The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and {{a large group of}} other NASA researchers that found no electronic defects.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new design {{to control the}} speed of the automobiles at remote places for fixed time. Generally, in automobiles throttle position is controlled by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) mainly according to the one of the inputs received from the <b>accelerator’s</b> Pedal <b>position</b> <b>sensor.</b> But in the proposed model, instead of ECU, another Microcontroller unit receives the pedal <b>position</b> from the <b>sensor</b> and then Microcontroller unit transfers to the ECU. The Microcontroller unit is also interfaced with the wireless module that is capable of detecting any other transceiver. Now, the automobile can be controlled at the desired places when we deploy the transmitters that send data frames with fields containing maximum speed and time for which this speed limitation is to be imposed...|$|R
5000|$|Electronic {{throttle}} control (ETC) is an automobile technology which electronically [...] "connects" [...] the accelerator {{pedal to the}} throttle, replacing a mechanical linkage. [...] A typical ETC system consists of three major components: (i) an accelerator pedal module (ideally with two or more independent sensors), (ii) a throttle valve that can be opened and closed by an electric motor (sometimes referred to as an electric or electronic throttle body (ETB)), and (iii) a powertrain or engine control module (PCM or ECM). The ECM {{is a type of}} electronic control unit (ECU), which is an embedded system that employs software to determine the required throttle position by calculations from data measured by other sensors, including the <b>accelerator</b> pedal <b>position</b> <b>sensors,</b> engine speed sensor, vehicle speed sensor, and cruise control switches. The electric motor is then used to open the throttle valve to the desired angle via a closed-loop control algorithm within the ECM.|$|R
50|$|Physical {{analysis}} {{conducted on}} Toyota’s {{electronic engine control}} system including <b>accelerator</b> pedal <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> (APPSs) in 2011 showed {{the presence of a}} significant number of tin whiskers. Tin whiskers are elongated or needle-like structures of pure tin that grow from pure tin and tin alloy surfaces. Toyota's APPS were found to use tin finishes. These tin finishes can produce conductive tin whiskers capable of creating unintended electrical failures such as short circuits. The use of tin finish in Toyota's APPS is therefore a cause for concern. Similarly in 2013, materials used in an automotive engine control unit (ECU) from a 2008 Toyota Tundra truck were analyzed. It was found that pure tin with a nickel underlayer was used as the connector finish in the unit, and analysis revealed tin whiskers on the connector surface. Further testing under a standard temperature-humidity cycling showed tin whisker growth, raising additional reliability and safety concerns. These studies show that poor design choices, {{such as the use of}} tin finishes, result in unintended failures.|$|R
40|$|The first {{objective}} of the PhD thesis {{is to develop a}} new type of <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor</b> to align components at micrometre level over 200 m with respect to a laser beam as straight line reference. The second objective is to estimate the measurement accuracy of the total alignment system over 200 m. The context of the PhD thesis is the Compact Linear Collider project, which is a study for a future particle <b>accelerator.</b> The proposed <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor</b> is made of a camera and an open/close shutter. The sensor can measure the position of the laser beam with respect to its own coordinate system. To do a measurement, the shutter closes, a laser spot appears on it, the camera captures a picture of the laser spot and the coordinates of the laser spot centre are reconstructed in the sensor coordinate system with image processing. Such a measurement requires reference targets on the <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor.</b> To reach the rst {{objective of}} the PhD thesis, we used laser theory and cam- era model to de ne an accurate image processing and we performed experiments to validate a prototype of a <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor.</b> For the second objective, we could not obtain results regarding measurement accuracy because we could not develop a full alignment system under vacuum over 200 m. However, we could estimate laser pointing stability over 200 m by extrapolating results obtained over 12 m. As a result, we present in this report a sensor design, a calibration protocol and estimations regarding measurement uncertainty. In case of a separate cali- bration with theodolites, we estimated the measurement uncertainty of the po- sitioning sensor to be 4 μ m for all coordinates. In case of a full auto-calibration, we estimated the measurement uncertainty of the <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor</b> to be 10 μ m for the radial and the vertical coordinates and 20 μ m for the depth coordinate. Concerning the extrapolation over long distance, we estimated laser pointing stability to be 10 μ m for a laser beam propagation distance of 200 m. Our work does not provide a complete laser beam alignment system at mi- crometre level over 200 m but it is the rst necessary step towards it...|$|R

In the drive-by-wire system, the engine’s throttle body {{is controlled by the}} powertrain computer in response to the accelerator pedal position—allowing the computer to determine the optimal throttle body, fuel, and CVT settings based on the <b>accelerator</b> pedal <b>position</b> and its rate of travel.|$|R

40|$|An {{electronic}} <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> for {{use with}} a power operated vehicle accessory, such as a power liftgate. The <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> includes an elongated resistive circuit that is mounted such that it is stationary and extends along {{the path of a}} track portion of the power operated accessory. The <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> further includes a contact nub mounted to a link member that moves within the track portion such that the contact nub is slidingly biased against the elongated circuit. As the link member moves under the force of a motor-driven output gear, the contact nub slides along the surface of the resistive circuit, thereby affecting the overall resistance of the circuit. The <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> uses the overall resistance to provide an electronic position signal to an ECU, wherein the signal is indicative of the absolute position of the power operated accessory. Accordingly, the electronic <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> is capable of providing an electronic signal that enables the ECU to track the absolute position of the power operated accessory...|$|R

One <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> is located in the catheter tip and six more are in six patches affixed to the patient's chest and back. By having the second set of <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> as a reference, the relative position of the catheter tip may be calculated. This offers improved accuracy within the magnetic fields along with detection of any patient movement. The relative position is important as it allows the location data to be referenced to patient anatomy.|$|R

Field oriented control algorithm is the main way to control permanent magnet synchronous motor, the magnetic field oriented control must be precise to get the rotational position of the motor. Therefore, the performance of the motor <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> directly affects the accuracy of the magnetic field oriented control.

It is used to calibrate the error of the relative <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor</b> {{which is used to}} provide the magnetic phase signal. On the basis of the analysis for the principle of the absolute <b>positioning</b> <b>sensor,</b> the paper describes the design of the sending and receiving coils and realizes the hardware and the software for the sensor. In order to enhance the reliability of the sensor, a support vector machine is used to recognize the fault characters, and the signal flow method is used to locate the faulty parts. The diagnosis information not only can be sent to an upper center control computer to evaluate the reliability of the sensors, but also can realize on-line diagnosis for debugging and the quick detection when the maglev train is off-line.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel linear switched reluctance motion {{system that can}} be driven by a general-purpose motor controller hardware. This is achieved by two methods: a low-cost <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> is first integrated into the linear switched reluctance motor (LSRM) by making use of the unique open structure feature of the motor. The resolution of the <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> is further enhanced via sine-cosine interpolation. The output of the proposed <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> is a standard quadrature (A,B) signal for industrial encoder interfacing. Then with a proper reconfiguration of the three-phase motor windings and the insertion of three diodes, the LSRM can be driven by a standard three-phase bridge inverter with two current feedback sensors only. By combining the proposed low-cost <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> and the novel driving scheme, the LSRM can directly replace any three-phase linear AC permanent magnet (PM) motors or linear AC induction motors without any hardware reconfiguration. This would increase the popularity of applying LSRM in motion control system...|$|R

40|$|Robot {{systems in}} {{critical}} applications, {{such as those}} in space and nuclear environments, must be able to operate during component failure to complete important tasks. One failure mode that has received little attention is the failure of joint <b>position</b> <b>sensors.</b> Current fault tolerant designs require the addition of directly redundant <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> which can affect joint design. A new method is proposed that utilizes analytical redundancy to allow for continued operation during joint <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> failure. Joint torque sensors are used with a virtual passive torque controller to make the robot joint stable without position feedback and improve position tracking performance in the presence of unknown link dynamics and end-effector loading. Two Cartesian accelerometer based methods are proposed to determine the position of the joint. The joint specific position determination method utilizes two triaxial accelerometers attached to the link driven by the joint with the failed <b>position</b> <b>sensor.</b> The joint specific method is not computationally complex and the position error is bounded. The system wide position determination method utilizes accelerometers distributed on different robot links and the end-effector to determine the position of sets of multiple joints. The system wide method requires fewer accelerometers than the joint specific method to make all joint <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> fault tolerant but is more computationally complex and has lower convergence properties. Experiments were conducted on a laboratory manipulator. Both position determination methods were shown to track the actual position satisfactorily. A controller using the position determination methods and the virtual passive torque controller was able to servo the joints to a desired <b>position</b> during <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> failure...|$|R
