40|$|To {{reconstruct}} Export Productivity (Pexp), 27 taxonomic {{categories of}} the planktonic foraminifera census data were used with the modern analog technique SIMMAX 28 (Pflaumann et al., 1996, doi: 10. 1029 / 95 PA 01743; 2003, doi: 10. 1029 / 2002 PA 000774). To the 26 taxonomic groups widely used and listed in Kucera et al. (2005, doi: 10. 1016 /j. quascirev. 2004. 07. 014), Turborotalita humilis was added in our calibration as it {{is associated with the}} PCC source region (Meggers et al., 2002, doi: 10. 1016 /S 0967 - 0645 (02) 00103 - 0). The modern <b>analog</b> <b>file</b> is based on the Iberian margin database (Salgueiro et al., 2008, doi: 10. 1016 /j. marmicro. 2007. 09. 003) combined with the North Atlantic surface samples used by the MARGO project (Kucera et al., 2005). This results in a total of 999 analogs for Pexp. Modern oceanic primary productivity (PP) is obtained for each site by averaging 12 monthly primary productivity values for a 8 -year period (1978 - 1986) that were estimated from satellite color data (CZCS) and gridded at 0. 5 ° latitude - longitude fields (Antoine et al., 1996, doi: 10. 1029 / 95 GB 02832). Export Productivity (Pexp) was calculated from the PP values following the empirical relationship Pexp = PP** 2 / 400 for primary production below 200 gC/m** 2 /yr, and Pexp = PP/ 2 for primary production above 200 gC/m 2 /yr (Eppley and Peterson, 1979, doi: 10. 1038 / 282677 a 0; Sarnthein et al., 1988, doi: 10. 1029 /PA 003 i 003 p 00361). The residuals gives the differences between satellite based Pexp and foraminiferal Pexp...|$|E

40|$|Part of the Volume on Digital Young, Innovation, and the Unexpected Digital media files {{have the}} {{potential}} to persist across time in ways that <b>analog</b> <b>files</b> of the same types do not. This persistence follows from the relatively new potential to learn of the existence of such files and to physically locate copies, and it means that such files may follow us across the whole of our lives, appearing and reappearing at the most inopportune moments. They are indexed, stored, and accessible due to the architecture of the digital age. This chapter shows how this persistence can be pernicious across time, with the potential for normal youthful experimentation to have long-lasting effects when embedded into digital media. It acknowledges that the law does not address this problem, and proposes both a broadening of our acceptance of the youthful acts that may be embedded in digital media, as well as giving more legal control to those whose youths are so embedded...|$|R

The FCC and NTIA urged manufacturers to include analogue pass-through voluntarily in all converter boxes, {{and some of the}} newest generation of models now offer the feature.|$|R
5000|$|Burrs are a rotary <b>analog</b> to <b>files</b> {{that cut}} [...] (hence their {{alternate}} name, rotary files). They {{are also in}} many ways comparable to endmills and to router bits; a distinction is that the latter usually have their toolpath controlled by the machine, whereas burrs are often used [...] However, there is substantial overlap in the use and toolpath control of these various classes of cutters, and in the outcomes accomplished with them. For example, endmills {{can be used in}} routers, and burrs can be used like endmills in milling by CNC or manual machine tools. In fact, burrs (the tools) are often used in CNC machining centers for removing burrs (the small flakes of metal) after a machining process.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} an on-line survey which was executed 2010 in german archives of all branches. The survey focused on metadata and used metadata standards for the annotation of audiovisual media like pictures, audio and video <b>files</b> (<b>analog</b> and digital). The findings motivate the question whether archives are able to collaborate in projects like europeana if they do not use accepted standards for their orientation. Archives need more resources and archival staff need more training to execute more complex tasks in an digital and semantic surrounding...|$|R
40|$|We show that, {{if there}} exists a {{realization}} of a Hopf algebra $H$ in a $H$-module algebra $A$, then one can split their cross-product into the tensor product algebra of $A$ itself with a subalgebra isomorphic to $H$ and commuting with $A$. This result applies in particular to the algebra underlying inhomogeneous quantum groups like the Euclidean ones, which are obtained as cross-products of the quantum Euclidean spaces $R_q^N$ with the quantum groups of rotation $U_qso(N) $ of $R_q^N$, for which it has no classical <b>analog.</b> Comment: Latex <b>file,</b> 27 pages.

50|$|However, {{the analog}} {{transmitter}} failed {{during the early}} morning hours of March 27, 2009, due to a malfunction of the cooling system at the transmitter facilities. Because of the cost and time involved that it would have taken to repair the <b>analog</b> transmitter, KETK <b>filed</b> a Notice of Suspension of Operations with the Federal Communications Commission and permanently shut down its analog operations over UHF channel 56 on March 27, 2009. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 22, using PSIP to display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 56, however KETK removed on-air references to its channel position several months prior to the transition in 2008 and only brands by its call letters.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{manuscript}} is three fold: 1) to describe an update to DockoMatic that allows the user to generate cyclic peptide <b>analog</b> structure <b>files</b> based on protein database (pdb) files, 2) to test {{the accuracy of the}} peptide analog structure generation utility, and 3) to evaluate the high throughput capacity of DockoMatic. The DockoMatic GUI interfaces with the software program Treepack to create user defined peptide analogs. To validate this approach, DockoMatic produced cyclic peptide analogs were tested for three dimensional structure consistency and binding affinity against four experimentally determined peptide structure files available in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics database. The peptides used to evaluate this new functionality were alpha-conotoxins ImI, PnIA, and their published analogs. Peptide analogs were generated by DockoMatic and tested for their ability to bind to X-ray crystal structure models of the acetylcholine binding protein originating from Aplysia californica. The results, consisting of over 300 simulations, demonstrate that DockoMatic predicts the binding energy of peptide structures to within 3. 5 kcal*mol− 1, and the orientation of bound ligand compares to within 1. 8 Å root mean square deviation (rmsd) for ligand structures as compared to experimental data. Evaluation of high throughput virtual screening capacity demonstrated that Dockomatic can collect, evaluate and summarize the output of 10, 000 AutoDock jobs in less than two hours of computational time, 100, 000 jobs requires approximately 15 hours and 1, 000, 000 jobs is estimated to take up to a week...|$|R
500|$|The {{cathode-ray}} tube {{amusement device}} is {{the earliest known}} interactive electronic game. The device simulates an artillery shell arcing towards targets on a cathode ray tube (CRT) screen, which {{is controlled by the}} player by adjusting knobs to change the trajectory of a CRT beam spot on the display in order to reach plastic targets overlaid on the screen. Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann constructed the game from <b>analog</b> electronics and <b>filed</b> for a patent in 1947, which was issued the following year. The gaming device was never manufactured or marketed to the public, so it had no effect on the future video game industry. Under most definitions, the device is not considered a video game, as while it had an electronic display it did not run on a computing device. [...] Therefore, despite its relevance to the early history of video games, it is not generally considered a candidate for the title of the first video game.|$|R
30|$|The {{structurally}} modified {{compounds in}} series 1 and 8 were predicted {{to be more}} potent compounds than their prototypes. Notably, all of the modified compounds in series 8 were predicted as moderately active compounds (Additional file 3) which may be governed {{by the presence of}} the aromatic ester in the molecule, as represented by the nArCOOR values (Additional file 2). Ester compounds 8 G and 8 B were noted as the most (MATS 8 v =  0.150) and the second most (MATS 8 v =  0.146) potent compounds among all modified compounds, respectively (Additional file 3). Apparently, both opened and closed chain para-triazole analogs of the modified compounds in series 8 exhibited more potent activities than their meta-triazole <b>analogs</b> (Additional <b>file</b> 5). The closed chain compounds (E, G and N, Fig.  6) were predicted to be more active than the opened chain compounds (A, C and J, Fig.  6) except for the opened chain analogs 8 B and 8 K were predicted as more potent compounds than the closed chain derivatives 8 F and 8 P, Additional file 4. However, effect of opened/closed chain were not clearly observed for OH (R 1) substituted compounds 8 L (opened chain, pIC 50  = − 0.779, Additional file 3) and 8 Q (closed chain, pIC 50  = − 0.778, Additional file 3) as represented by their comparable pIC 50 values. For both para- and meta- analogs of all modified series (Fig.  6), 1 -adamantyl (R 2) substituted compounds exhibited more potent activity than phenyl (R 2) substituted compounds, except for series 1. The phenyl (R 2) substituted compound of meta-series, compound 1 M, was more potent than its 1 -adamantyl (R 2) analog 1 R (Additional file 4). No effect of changing substituted ring type (R 2) was found for para-series as observed from comparable cytotoxic activities of compounds 1 H and 1 D, Additional file 4.|$|R
5000|$|Software {{that creates}} machine-processable {{structure}} can utilize the linguistic, auditory, and visual structure {{that exist in}} all forms of human communication. Algorithms can infer this inherent structure from text, for instance, by examining word morphology, sentence syntax, and other small- and large-scale patterns. Unstructured information can then be enriched and tagged to address ambiguities and relevancy-based techniques then used to facilitate search and discovery. Examples of [...] "unstructured data" [...] may include books, journals, documents, metadata, health records, audio, video, <b>analog</b> data, images, <b>files,</b> and unstructured text such as the body of an e-mail message, Web page, or word-processor document. While the main content being conveyed {{does not have a}} defined structure, it generally comes packaged in objects (e.g. in files or documents, …) that themselves have structure and are thus a mix of structured and unstructured data, but collectively this is still referred to as [...] "unstructured data". For example, an HTML web page is tagged, but HTML mark-up typically serves solely for rendering. It does not capture the meaning or function of tagged elements in ways that support automated processing of the information content of the page. XHTML tagging does allow machine processing of elements, although it typically does not capture or convey the semantic meaning of tagged terms.|$|R
