Data were analyzed with Statistical Package for Social Science program. The major finding was that children???s age was significantly related to cognitive and affective components of children???s <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> elderly. Children increased their cognitive abilities to discriminate age, to give alternative names for old people, and to describe characteristics of aging as they became older. However, the older children became, the less positive affective <b>attitudes</b> they had <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> elderly. It was found that children???s contact with the elderly was not significantly related to children???s <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> elderly although to children who lived with their grandparents seemed to have more positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> elderly than those who didn???t live with their grandparents.

40|$|Objective: Several factors {{affect the}} quality of care in the elderly, such as nurses' attitudes. This study aimed to assess nurses' <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> elderly in <b>the</b> city of Ilam. Method: This {{cross-sectional}} study was conducted among 230 nurses working at public hospitals in the city of Ilam. Participants were selected using simple random sampling from the list of staff. The Kogan's attitude questionnaire was used to measure nurses' <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> elderly. Results: The mean age of respondents in this study was 32. 65 (SD =  7. 67), and <b>the</b> score of <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> elderly was 144. 96 (SD =  51. 75) in average.

Specifically, it was hypothesized that there would be a significant relationship between degree of acculturation and <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> marriage process. The sample consisted of 126 Jewish Iranian men and women residing in the Los Angeles area. The participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 (M = 39). The participants were obtained through nonrandom measures from various cultural organizations, colleges, and social functions. Participants filled out three questionnaires consisting of a demographic questionnaire, a modified version of the Cultural Life Style Inventory (Mendoza, 1989), and the Marriage Process Scale (Banafsheian, 2003). As expected, the results of the study revealed a significant positive relationship between cultural resistance (CR) and <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> marriage process, in that as CR increased, traditional <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> marriage process also increased. A significant negative relationship was found between cultural shift (CS) and <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> marriage process, in that as CS increased, traditional <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> marriage process decreased.

5|$|The <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Chinese {{language}} was contradictory. In Teishi's court, Chinese had been flaunted and considered {{a symbol of}} imperial rule and superiority. Yet, in Shōshi's salon {{there was a great}} deal of hostility towards the language—perhaps owing to political expedience during a period when Chinese began to be rejected in favor of Japanese—even though Shōshi herself was a student of the language. The hostility may have affected Murasaki and her opinion of the court, and forced her to hide her knowledge of Chinese. Unlike Shōnagon, who was both ostentatious and flirtatious, as well as outspoken about her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki seems to have been humble, an attitude which possibly impressed Michinaga. Although Murasaki used Chinese and incorporated it in her writing, she publicly rejected the language, a commendable attitude during a period of burgeoning Japanese culture.|$|E
5|$|When Robbins wins {{a prestigious}} grant to help treat {{children}} in Malawi, a disgruntled Torres agrees to move there with her, as the position {{will last for}} three years; however, her lack of enthusiasm causes Robbins to end their relationship and go without her. A heartbroken Torres moves in with Sloan, {{and they have a}} one-night stand. Robbins returns for Torres, apologizing and hoping for forgiveness, but Torres initially rebuffs her, and later reveals that she is pregnant with Sloan's baby. Robbins agrees to raise the child with her, but dislikes that Sloan will be a permanent part of their lives. En route a weekend getaway, Robbins proposes to Torres, but before Torres can reply, the two are in a head-on collision with a truck, leaving Torres severely injured. In an attempt to save her life, obstetrician-gynecologist Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), delivers Torres's premature baby. Torres survives, and agrees to marry Robbins. After twelve weeks of recovery, both Torres and baby Sofia are discharged and allowed to leave the hospital. Torres recovers from her surgery, but deals with the backlash from her mother (Gina Gallego)'s <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> wedding and her granddaughter. Torres and Robbins marry in a garden after the minister's wife falls ill, with general surgeon Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), officiating the ceremony.|$|E
40|$|Background: In 2017, brands {{have started}} to use their {{advertisements}} to take stance in political issues.

5|$|That same year, Brian Hodgson, who {{had spent}} many years in Nepal serving as the Assistant Resident, and who had a good {{knowledge}} about Nepal's bio-diversity, culture, and politics, became the new British Resident. Although the British Residents were officially instructed {{to keep out of}} the internal politics of Nepal, the Resident was courted by both the King as well as the Mukhtiyar. Hodgson was waiting for an opportunity to exploit the rift between the Mukhtiyar and the royal family and begin a more aggressive campaign to increase British influence and trading opportunities. Hodgson also believed the large standing army to be a security threat and that the border tensions could be pacified if the King was directly in control, rather than a mukhtiyar who needed to keep {{on the right side of}} the army. By 1834, Hodgson had come to a conclusion that he would not be able to have his way so long as Bhimsen was in control of the Nepalese administration; thus he strongly sympathized with the Pande faction, and he wished to install Fateh Jung Shah, who was more favorably disposed to him, as the mukhtiyar. In August 1834, Hodgson proposed to conduct a new commercial treaty between Nepal and Britain, which Bhimsen in principle agreed to but disagreed with several of the clauses. At a time when his authority was diminishing, Bhimsen could not afford to antagonize the Resident; but at the same time, he could not accept his proposals and be seen as subservient to the British by the Nepalese court. Nevertheless, he tried to maintain a friendly and conciliatory <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Resident, in order to win him as his ally, by loosening the restrictions on his movements and granting direct access to the King.|$|E

Analyses of American National Election Studies and General Social Survey data are consistent with these expectations. Among those with more negative <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> news media, party identification has more influence and current economic conditions less influence on voting preferences.
