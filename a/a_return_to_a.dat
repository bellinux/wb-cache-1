5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, when {{alternative}} rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as {{a pioneer of}} the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members.|$|E
5|$|Even as Texian {{governmental}} authority declined, rumors flew that Santa Anna would personally lead {{an invasion}} of Texas to quell the rebellion. Despite this news, Texian army strength continued to dwindle. Texas settlers were divided on whether they were fighting for independence or <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> federalist government in Mexico. The confusion caused many settlers to remain at home or to return home. Fewer than 100Texian soldiers remained garrisoned at the Alamo Mission in San Antonio de Béxar (now San Antonio, Texas). Their commander, James C. Neill, feared that his small force {{would be unable to}} withstand an assault by the Mexican troops. In response to Neill's repeated requests for reinforcements, Governor Smith assigned Travis and 30 men to the Alamo; they arrived on February 3. Most of the Texians, including Travis, believed that any Mexican invasion was months away.|$|E
5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E

5|$|Rieve and his {{executive}} officer were both severely criticized {{for failing to}} take all possible steps to save Karlsruhe in a later investigation into the sinking. The report concluded that since the ship was still afloat after two hours, and two torpedoes were required to sink her, {{it might have been}} possible to take her under tow back to Kristiansand or another port. In addition, the forward pumps still had power, and so the flooding could have been slowed enough to permit <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> safe harbor.|$|E
5|$|The {{circulation}} {{rose from}} 64,000 in 1965 to 67,000 in 1967; the modest 5% increase was exceeded only by Analog {{among the other}} science-fiction magazines, and If won the Hugo Award for best professional SF magazine three years running during this period. However, in March 1969, Robert Guinn sold all four of his magazines, including Galaxy and If, to Arnold Abramson at Universal Publishing and Distribution Corporation (UPD). Pohl was in Rio de Janeiro {{when he heard the}} news, and decided to resign his position as editor rather than continue under the new management. He had been considering <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> writing career for some time and the change in ownership precipitated his decision to leave.|$|E
5|$|The {{pictures}} {{are not in}} strictly chronological order. If they are perceived as three groups, then the pictures {{in each of the}} three units inform upon each other, in the same way as was usual in Medieval paintings and stained glass. The three sections of Creation, Downfall, and Fate of Humanity appear in reverse order, when read from the entrance of the chapel. However, each individual scene is painted to be viewed when looking toward the altar. This is not easily apparent when viewing a reproduced image of the ceiling but becomes clear when the viewer looks upward at the vault. Paoletti and Radke suggest that this reversed progression symbolises <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> state of grace. However, the three sections are generally described in the order of Biblical chronology.|$|E

5|$|The team {{considered}} several ideas, including <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> post-apocalyptic {{earth and}} the conquest of another planet in the Alpha Centauri system, before deciding to keep the new title on Planet. The premise allowed them to mix and match old and new characters and delve into {{the mysteries of the}} monoliths and alien artifacts. The backstory evolved quickly, and the main conflict centered on the return of the original alien inhabitants. The idea of humans inadvertently caught up in an off-world civil war focused the story.|$|E

25|$|Thus, the {{new system}} would be devoid (initially) of governments meddling with their {{currency}} supply as they had {{during the years of}} economic turmoil preceding WWII.

Equally, in 1818 the Tsar asked Count Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev to draw up a constitution. However, internal and external unrest, which the Tsar believed stemmed from political liberalisation, led to a series of repressions and <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> former government of restriction and conservatism.|$|E

The reigns of Domnall and his successor, Niall Frossach of the Cenél nEógain, had been {{relatively}} peaceful, but Donnchad's rule saw <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more expansionist policy directed against Leinster, traditional target of the Uí Néill, and also, for the first time, the great southern kingdom of Munster.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to survey the history, {{development}} and cur-rent status of the Return Times Theorem and its many extensions and variations. Let (X,F, µ) be a finite measure space and let T: X → X be a measure preserving transformation. Perhaps the oldest result in er-godic theory is that of Poincaré’s Recurrence Principle [Poi 87] which states: Theorem 0. 1. For any set A ∈ F, the set of points x of A such that Tnx / ∈ A for all n> 0 has zero measure. This says that almost every point of <b>A</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>A.</b> In fact, almost every point of <b>A</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>A</b> infinitely often. The <b>return</b> time for <b>a</b> given element x ∈ A, rA(x) = inf{k ≥ 1 : T kx ∈ A}, is the first time that the element x <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> the set <b>A.</b> This is visualized in the figure below. By Theorem 0. 1, there is set of full measure in A such that all elements of this set have <b>a</b> finite <b>return</b> time. Our study of the return times theorem asks how we can further generalize this notion. 1 a...|$|R
