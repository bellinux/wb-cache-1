5|$|By 681 {{the armies}} of the Umayyad Caliphate had {{expanded}} from their original homeland of <b>Arabia</b> <b>to</b> conquer North Africa, the Middle East and large parts of West Asia, bringing Islam in their wake and converting local peoples to the new religion. The Berbers of North Africa, called Moors by the Christians, thereby became Muslims. The Strait of Gibraltar became the frontier between Muslim North Africa and Christian Hispania and thus gained a new strategic significance. Hispania descended into {{civil war in the}} 8th century as rival Visigothic factions fought for control of the throne. This gave the Moors the opportunity to invade Hispania and pursue a course of dividing-and-conquering the Christian factions.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of Muhammad's life, the Quraysh tribe he belonged to became a {{dominant}} force in western Arabia. They formed the cult association of hums, which tied members of many tribes in western <b>Arabia</b> <b>to</b> the Kaaba and reinforced the prestige of the Meccan sanctuary. To counter the effects of anarchy, Quraysh upheld the institution of sacred months during which all violence was forbidden, and it was possible to participate in pilgrimages and fairs without danger. Thus, although the association of hums was primarily religious, it also had important economic consequences for the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Abu Ali Iyad {{was born}} in Qalqilyah in the modern-day West Bank when Palestine was under the British Mandate. He was educated there, {{graduating from high school}} in 1953 and taught at schools in the city and nearby Azzun. A year later, he moved to Baquba, Iraq where he {{enrolled}} in a teacher training program. He left Iraq the same year, moving to Saudi <b>Arabia</b> <b>to</b> teach there afterward. In 1962, he had a job as a teacher in Algeria. However, he soon sought and received training by the Algerian Army, graduating from its training course in the summer of 1964.|$|E

5|$|In late 2000, Wail {{traveled}} to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's checks, presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers passed through the United Arab Emirates and purchased traveler's checks, including Majed Moqed, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami. The 9/11 Commission believes {{that three of the}} future muscle hijackers, including Wail and Waleed, traveled in a group from Saudi <b>Arabia</b> <b>to</b> Beirut and then onward to Iran where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.|$|E
5|$|Quwatli was reelected in 1948, but was toppled in a {{military}} coup in 1949. He subsequently went into exile in Egypt, returning to Syria in 1955 {{to participate in the}} presidential election, which he won. A conservative presiding over an increasingly leftist-dominated government, Quwatli officially adopted neutralism amid the Cold War. After his request for aid from the United States was denied, he drew closer to the Eastern bloc. He also entered Syria into a defense arrangement with Egypt and Saudi <b>Arabia</b> <b>to</b> confront the influence of the Baghdad Pact. In 1957, Quwatli, who the US and the Pact countries attempted but failed to oust, sought to stem the leftist tide in Syria, but to no avail. By then, his political authority had receded as the military bypassed Quwatli's jurisdiction by independently coordinating with Quwatli's erstwhile ally, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser.|$|E
5|$|Shehri was an {{elementary}} school teacher from Khamis Mushait in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia. In early 2000 he traveled to Medina to seek treatment for mental problems.

The brothers were chosen, along with others from the same region of Saudi <b>Arabia,</b> <b>to</b> participate in the September 11 attacks. Once selected, Shehri returned to Saudi Arabia in October 2000 to obtain a clean passport, then returned to Afghanistan. In March 2001, he recorded his last will and testament on video.|$|E

5|$|Tales of the undead {{consuming}} {{the blood}} or flesh of living beings {{have been found}} in nearly every culture around the world for many centuries. Today we know these entities predominantly as vampires, but in ancient times, the term vampire did not exist; blood drinking and similar activities were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood; even the devil was considered synonymous with the vampire. Almost every nation has associated blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon, from the ghouls of <b>Arabia</b> <b>to</b> the goddess Sekhmet of Egypt. Indeed, some of these legends could have given rise to the European folklore, though they are not strictly considered vampires by historians when using today's definitions.|$|E
5|$|The Abbasids used Alexandria, Damietta, Aden and Siraf as entry ports to India and China. Merchants {{arriving}} from India {{in the port}} city of Aden paid tribute in form of musk, camphor, ambergris and sandalwood to Ibn Ziyad, the sultan of Yemen. Moluccan products shipped across the ports of <b>Arabia</b> <b>to</b> the Near East passed through the ports of India and Sri Lanka. Indian exports of spices find mention in the works of Ibn Khurdadhbeh (850 CE), al-Ghafiqi (1150), Ishak bin Imaran (907) and Al Kalkashandi (14th century). After reaching either the Indian or the Sri Lankan ports, spices were sometimes shipped to East Africa, where they were used for many purposes, including burial rites.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, Fluor {{built the}} first all-hydrogen {{refinery}} in Kuwait and the first exclusively offshore power plant for the Atlantic Richfield Company. It also constructed pumps and ports for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which traversed 800 miles from northern Alaska to Valdez, Alaska, and the world's largest offshore facility for natural gas {{on the island of}} Java in Indonesia. In 1976, it was awarded a $5 billion project for ARAMCO in Saudi <b>Arabia,</b> <b>to</b> design facilities that capture sour gas, which is expelled from oil wells as waste, in order to refine it into fuel. That same year a partially completed copper and cobalt mine in Africa was cancelled due to a war in the neighboring region of Angola and declining copper prices.
