40|$|OBJETIVO: Detectar hipotireoidismo subclínico em gestantes. MATERIAL E MÉTODO: Foram estudadas 75 gestantes, voluntárias, residentes na cidade de Itabuna, Bahia. O protocolo constou de: critérios de inclusão: gestante com faixa etária AIM: To detect {{subclinical}} hypothyroidism in {{pregnant women}}. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy-five pregnant women who {{resided in the}} town of Itabuna, state of Bahia, were voluntarily studied. Inclusion criteria were age < 40 years, no history of previous thyroid disease, <b>autoimmunopathy</b> or diabetes mellitus, and any gestational age; a clinical evaluation (an interview obeying to a questionnaire); laboratory evaluation (free T 4, TSH, anti-TPO antibody, total and HDL cholesterol, triglyceride determinations); thyroid ultrasonography. RESULTS: Average age was 21. 6 ± 5. 1 (14 - 40 years); gestation age was 24. 2 ± 8. 2 (5 - 39 weeks); an elevated TSH with normal free T 4 was found in 3 cases (4. 0 %). Anti-TPO antibodies were positive in 8. 0 % on the pregnant women. In 5. 4 % of them, thyroid ultrasonographic changes were documented. CONCLUSION: Based on finding of a 4 % prevalence of elevated TSH during pregnancy, the authors consider important the inclusion of thyroid function laboratory evaluation in the routine prenatal examination. Further studies appear necessary to establish at what gestational age thyroid function evaluation should be started in pregnant women and how frequently it should be repeated during the course of gestation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Erythema elevatum et diutinum (EED) is {{classified}} as a variant of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The etiology of this disease is unknown. Erythema elevatum et diutinum may coexist with several systemic disorders including hematologic and rheumatologic diseases as well as type 1 diabetes, thyroid diseases and other endocrinopathies. Autoimmune polyglandular syndromes (APS) are rarely diagnosed conditions characterized by the coexistence {{of at least two}} autoimmune endocrinopathies and non-endocrine <b>autoimmunopathies.</b> Objective. Presentation of a patient with EED coexisting with APS type 3. Case report. A 23 -year-old male patient was admitted to our department due to nodular lesions lasting for 5 months, located on the extremities, which were diagnosed clinically and confirmed histopathologically as EED. In spite of skin lesions the patient suffered from diabetes mellitus type 1, hyperthyroidism, celiac disease, myopathy and idiopathic urticaria – abnormalities characteristic for APS type 3. Substantial clinical improvement was observed after systemic administration of dapsone and, due to upper respiratory tract infection, a few weeks of antibiotic therapy. Conclusions. We present this case due to the rarity of EED, especially coexisting with APS, and the good effect of therapy with dapsone and oral antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|Invasive {{aspergillosis}} is {{a devastating}} infection in immunocompromised hosts. The lung {{is the most}} common site of primary infection, and the central nervous system {{is the most common}} secondary site of invasive disease. Invasive aspergillosis in <b>autoimmunopathies</b> treated with corticosteroids has rarely been reported in the literature. Herein, we report the case of a 48 -year-old female patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura complicated with fatal invasive pulmonary and cerebral aspergillosis. She had been given 1, 016 g intravenous amphotericin B empirically for lung infection during a previous admission. At presentation, she had fever, cough, and shortness of breath for 4 weeks. Chest radiography revealed a huge cavity over the left upper lung field. Bronchoscopic biopsy and culture showed Aspergillus species. She was initially treated with intravenous amphotericin B (0. 9 mg/kg/day), and intravenous hydrocortisone for her idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. However, deterioration of consciousness occurred 12 days after hospitalization. Computed tomography of the brain showed ring-like cystic mass lesions in the right side basal ganglion. Stereotactic aspiration of the brain revealed Aspergillus species. Her condition exacerbated despite combination treatment with high-dose amphotericin B (1. 2 mg/kg/day) and itraconazole (400 mg/day). She died 24 days after admission. This case suggests that treatment with corticosteroids and premature discontinuation of antifungal drugs bear the risk of fatal cerebral involvement in patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis...|$|R
