5000|$|Puccinia asparagi is the causative {{agent of}} <b>asparagus</b> <b>rust.</b> It is an {{autoecious}} fungus, meaning that {{all stages of}} its life cycle - pyciniospores, aeciospores, and teliospores - all develop upon the same host plant ...|$|E
5000|$|... The Puccinia asparagi fungus accomplishes this by rust {{lowering}} {{the amounts of}} root storage metabolites [...]The infected plant has reduced plant vigor and yield, often leading to death in severe cases [...] Most rust diseases have several stages, {{some of which may}} occur on different hosts; however, in <b>asparagus</b> <b>rust</b> all the life stages (orange spore in spring, red spore in summer, and black spore in autumn and winter) occur on asparagus. Because of this, many observers mistake the different stages of the Puccinia asparagi life cycle as the presence of different diseases [...] The effects of Puccinia asparagi are present worldwide wherever asparagus is being grown [...] <b>Asparagus</b> <b>rust</b> is a serious threat to the asparagus industry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Asparagus</b> <b>rust</b> {{is found}} {{worldwide}} wherever garden asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) is grown. As with many crop diseases, rust disease caused by Puccinia asparagi spreads rapidly due to poor field maintenance and close proximity of crop fields - <b>asparagus</b> <b>rust</b> was enabled to establish itself from New Jersey to California in five years. The disease {{has long been}} known in Europe, but did not attain prominence in the United States until 1902. Since then, the rust has spread to every important asparagus-growing region in the United States. Even in areas with climate ill suited to support vegetation, such as the Imperial Valley of California, have reported severe rust damage, with many crop fields having 100% infection rate. Puccinia asparagi also attacks a number of nonedible species of asparagus, including A. brouseopetii, A. caspius, A. maritimus, A. medeoloides, asparagus fern (A. plumosus), and A. verticillatus. It has also been observed to attack the common onion, Welsh or Spanish onion, chives, and shallot.|$|E

5000|$|... <b>Asparagus</b> <b>rust</b> occurs {{wherever}} {{the plant is}} grown and attacks asparagus plants {{during and after the}} cutting season. Asparagus spears are usually harvested before extensive rust symptoms appear [...] Symptoms are first noticeable on the growing shoots in early summer as light green, oval lesions, followed by tan blister spots and black, protruding blisters later in the season [...] The lesions are symptoms of Puccinia asparagi during early spring, mid-summer and later summer to fall, respectively. Severe rust infections stunt or kill young asparagus shoots, causing foliage to fall prematurely, and reduce the ability of the plant to store food reserves ...|$|E
50|$|In addition, plant {{rust-resistant}} {{varieties of}} asparagus, such as Viking KB3, Jersey Centennial, Jersey Titan, Delmonte 361, Jersey Giant, Greenwich, and Martha Washington, {{are reported to}} grow well in Minnesota. Genetic resistance in asparagus to Puccinia asparagi is recognized as an efficient means of managing rust. Pioneer work on <b>asparagus</b> <b>rust</b> resistance {{led to the development}} of the Washington varieties, including Martha Washington (Norton 1913). Since then much effort has been directed towards identifying resistance, which has {{led to the development of}} asparagus cultivars (e.g. Jersey Giant, Jersey Centennial, Jersey Titan, Delmonte 361 and Greenwich) with quantitative, rather than qualitative resistance, resulting in differences in the intensity of infection. This resistance has been termed 'slow-rusting'.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Asparagus</b> <b>rust</b> {{was first}} {{reported}} in the U.S. in 1896. It began on the asparagus crops of mostly northeastern states and began to move westward across the country- For each successive year the disease was discovered in new western areas until in 1902 it was reported in California for the first time. Research to control the disease began with Bordeaux mixture experiments around {{the start of the}} 20th century. Copper and sulfur dust were tried as well but their success was very limited. Sulfur was the only one to have much success at all. Rust resistant strains of asparagus were cultivated but by the 1940s and 1950s these strains of asparagus were no longer providing adequate levels of resistance. In the 1950s zineb and mancozeb were developed as the primary means to control rust. Zineb reduced infection by 85% and mancozeb by 97% [...] By 1989 EBDC fungicides had become the most common fungicidal means to control rust on asparagus. However, after the EPA almost cancelled the use of EBDCs on asparagus many processors decided they would not accept EBDC-treated asparagus despite the EPA allowing its use after review. This meant that many growers were left with no registered fungicide to use on asparagus. Since 1990 the EPA has granted exemptions for tebuconazole, myclobutanil, and triadimefon for use on asparagus.|$|E

Early in September the rust was found in considerable quantities {{in one of the}} asparagus beds on the college farm; since then it has been observed at many points by ourselves and Mr. M. Cumming, in and about Ames. It was also reported to us from McBride, Iowa, by Mr. H. A. Mueller, in September, 1900, as being abundant at that place and at Mt. Pleasant by Mr. E. E. Hodson...|$|E
40|$|The long {{distance}} dispersal of many plant pathogens {{has been well}} documented. This phenomenon is also common in Australasia, with wind currents and movement of people and possibly plant material facilitating introduction of several rust pathogens from Australia to New Zealand. The history of the arrival, survival and spread of three rust pathogens from Australia to New Zealand is outlined. Initial outbreaks of poplar rust in 1973, wheat stripe rust in 1980 and blackberry rust in 1990 are all {{likely to have been}} initiated from spores originating in Australia. After arrival, urediniospores have to be viable and there must be sufficient susceptible hosts and favourable environmental conditions so that initial infection foci can establish and facilitate further spread. This information is used to assess the risks posed to New Zealand by other rust pathogens that occur in Australia, such as <b>asparagus</b> <b>rust,</b> and to assess ways to minimise these risks...|$|E
