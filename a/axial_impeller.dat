The impact of changes in particle properties and operating parameters was also evaluated. The conclusions of the work are: Scaling of the suspension of fast settling zeolite particles was best described by the constant power per unit volume method. Increasing the zeolite particle concentration increased the required mixer power needed to suspend the particles. Decreasing the zeolite particle size from 0. 7 mm � 0. 3 mm decreased the required mixer power needed to suspend the particles.

With {{increase in the}} concentration of slurries, the stirrer speed and consequently the energy required to suspend the solids off the tank bottom increase significantly. Most of previous studies are limited to low solids concentrations. However, {{there has always been}} a need to determine the best possible impeller and tank geometries, and optimum operating conditions for tanks handling high concentration slurries, such as those found in mineral processing plants. Experiments were carried out in a small perspex tank. The critical impeller speed required to suspend spherical glass particles off the tank bottom was determined by visual observation of sedimentation height at the tank bottom. Water and aqueous glycerol solution were used as the liquid phases. Various impellers were used in this study. Impeller power consumption was determined by measuring the torque in the impeller shaft using a torque transducer. The optimum solid concentration at which (Pjs/Ms) is the minimum is found to vary between 20 and 35 % (v/v) depending on the impeller type and baffled conditions. Higher power number radial impellers are found to be more energy efficient than lower power number <b>axial</b> <b>impellers</b> for suspending fine particles in the unbaffled condition.

Improvement in energy efficiency can be accomplished by installing multiple impellers for high solids concentration. It also appears that at high solids concentration, Cv= 0. 4 v/v, a dual radial impeller system is most sensitive to baffle removal. It is suggested that for slowly reacting slurry systems, typical in mineral processing operations, the agitator design based on just-off-bottom solids suspension should be used.

But {{at the low end}} of particle size range, changes in the settling velocity are small while continued reduction in particle size corresponds to substantial increase in total particle surface area, leading to increased ɛjs possibly due to particles interactions.

40|$|Despite its {{importance}} in chemical industries, {{there are few}} works which studies anchor type impellers and {{only a fraction of}} the works investigate these systems under a computational approach. The great majority refers to turbine impellers, specially Rushton turbines, under turbulent flow. Anchor impellers are used specially for highly viscous flow, typical of polymer reactions. The viscosity is normally in the range 1000 - 10000 cp. Since this range of viscosity describe highly viscous flows, the reactions for anchor agitated systems are normally carried out under laminar flow. This work presents a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach to study the behaviour of stirred vessels using anchor impellers. The axial plane of the tank, which is being modelled, is divided into small control volumes, which collectively is referred to as the mesh, or grid. In each of these cells the momentum balance, energy and mass conservation, which describes the model, are rewritten algebraically using the finite volumes method to relate such variables as velocity, pressure and temperature to values in neighbouring cells. The equations are then solved numerically, and the results yield the flow corresponding to the model. Since the geometry of a vessel with anchor impellers strictly calls for a three dimensional method, an approximation is made to account for the effect of the blades (Kuncewics, 1992).

40|$|The {{flow field}} in {{two-phase}} boiling and gas-liquid Stirred Tank Reactors, STR, was examined {{in relation to}} cavity formation and the associated Relative Power Demand, RPD. The cavitation process has been classified in various stages for both radial and <b>axial</b> <b>impellers</b> operating in boiling water. Experiments done in a boiling reactor of 0. 45 m diameter agitated by radial and <b>axial</b> <b>impellers</b> showed that the Relative Power Demand, RPD, can be correlated well {{with the help of}} a new formulation of Cavitation number named the Cavagitation number. Differences in RPD between gas-sparged and boiling reactors detected during the experiments imply that there are differences in the mechanism of cavity formation in the two systems. These differences are explained by a consistent physical model. The model was shown to be adequate for most of the features of both boiling and sparged reactors reported in the literature. The flow field in a two-phase boiling reactor has been investigated for the first time in the open literature using Laser Doppler Velocimetry, LDV, in conditions where the RPD was as low as 0. 55. Measurements gave important data of the way the flow field is changed by the presence of the second phase which forms stable cavities behind impeller blades. The results also quantified the associated flow field changes in the impeller discharge stream and in the bulk of the reactor. The two-phase flow field was quantitatively described {{with the help of a}} simple model derived on the basis of energy balances calculated around the impeller. The model estimates liquid flow rates and mean liquid velocities in the two-phase system using data of the corresponding single-phase system coupled with information about the RPD. Knowledge of the void fraction seems to improve the model predictions which were shown to be in fairly good agreement with the data of mean flow rates that exist in the literature. LDV measurements done in a boiling stirred tank of 0. 45 m diameter showed that flow rates can be predicted within an accuracy of around 10 % and mean liquid velocities with an accuracy better than 25 %, even without taking into account void fraction. Model predictions can be used as input values for numerical codes available for the calculation of flows in two-phase stirred tank reactors. Application of the model is independent of geometry and scale...|$|R
40|$|Hydrodynamics, temperature, pH {{and various}} other physico-chemical factors {{influence}} the morphology of nickel produced via hydrogen reduction. The focus of the current work is the effect on hydrodynamics of changing the impeller and reactor configurations in a 75 l stirred vessel with draft tube and baffles. The aim was to determine which configuration resulted in maximum particle suspension and local gas hold-up while using the minimum impeller speed and power consumption. A response surface methodology of experimental design was employed. This ensured {{that the number of}} candidate variables to be tested was reduced to a minimum and that interactive effects between variables were taken into account. The impeller configurations tested were a single Rushton turbine, a single <b>axial</b> flow <b>impeller,</b> and a double impeller system consisting of a combination of the two. The reactor configurations, tested at different gas flow rates, were varied to test the effects with and without baffles. It was found that optimum mixing could be achieved using a baffled vessel with an upper <b>axial</b> flow <b>impeller</b> and a lower Rushton turbine, and by keeping a minimum impeller clearance from the vessel bottom. This is in agreement with [Mineral Processing, 1 – 2 August 2002]...|$|R
