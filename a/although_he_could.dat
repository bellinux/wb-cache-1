5|$|The 1905 Tour de France was {{the third}} edition of the Tour de France, held from 9 to 30 July, {{organized}} by the newspaper L'Auto. Following the disqualifications after the 1904 Tour de France, there were changes in the rules, {{the most important one}} being the general classification not made by time but by points. The race saw the introduction of mountains in the Tour de France, and René Pottier excelled in the first mountain, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not finish the race.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{his time}} as housing {{secretary}} was considered unsuccessful. However, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not get federal funding for empowerment zones passed during his tenure, by 1992 38 states had created empowerment zones, and in 1994 $3.5billion was approved for them under President Clinton. A free market Kemp initiative to allow homeowners to subdivide their houses {{for the purpose of}} creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the Clinton administration, however. In 1992, with H. Ross Perot mounting a formidable campaign, Kemp was again considered a Vice Presidential candidate.|$|E
5|$|Isaac D'Israeli {{had never}} taken {{religion}} very seriously, but had remained a conforming member of the Bevis Marks Synagogue. His father, the elder Benjamin, was a prominent and devout member; it was probably from respect for him that Isaac did not leave when he fell out with the synagogue authorities in 1813. After Benjamin senior died in 1816 Isaac felt free to leave the congregation following a second dispute. Isaac's friend Sharon Turner, a solicitor, convinced him that <b>although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> comfortably remain unattached to any formal religion it would be disadvantageous to the children if they did so. Turner stood as godfather when Benjamin was baptised, aged twelve, on 31 July 1817.|$|E
25|$|He {{was known}} as the Pocket Hercules, because <b>although</b> short <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hit powerfully. <b>He</b> was {{particularly}} strong on the off-side, and appeared to {{have plenty of time to}} play his shots.|$|R
50|$|Roger Proot (born 21 November 1905 in Woumen - died 29 September 1971 in Bruges) was a Belgian {{football}} player. His {{position on}} the field was forward, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> also <b>could</b> function as back-up goalkeeper.|$|R
5000|$|Noah {{plays for}} the senior French {{national}} basketball team, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> also <b>could</b> have been eligible for the American or Swedish teams. [...] "The French National team is definitely {{something that has been}} in my dreams for a while", he said.|$|R
5|$|When {{profiling}} Kane in February 2013, Talksport {{said that}} he was best as a second striker, despite also having ability as a centre forward or in a wide position. They wrote that he preferred to place his shots, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> also score from distance. The report also noted that he had good pace, but was weak in the air and had not scored on his loan at Norwich. Initially a back-up to £26million Spanish import Roberto Soldado and frequently loaned out, Kane was eventually made Tottenham's starting forward by manager Mauricio Pochettino.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not {{convince}} Congress {{to outlaw}} the spoils system, Hayes issued {{an executive order}} that forbade federal office holders from being required to make campaign contributions or otherwise taking part in party politics. Chester A. Arthur, the Collector of the Port of New York, and his subordinates Alonzo B. Cornell and George H. Sharpe, all Conkling supporters, refused to obey the president's order. In September 1877, Hayes demanded the three men's resignations, which they refused to give. He submitted appointments of Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., L. Bradford Prince, and Edwin Merritt—all supporters of Evarts, Conkling's New York rival—to the Senate for confirmation as their replacements. The Senate's Commerce Committee, which Conkling chaired, voted unanimously to reject the nominees, and the full Senate rejected Roosevelt and Prince {{by a vote of}} 31–25, confirming Merritt only because Sharpe's term had expired.|$|E
5|$|Dam asked Vann, who was {{circling}} the battlefield aboard an L-19 reconnaissance aircraft, to reconnoiter possible landing zones {{on the east}} and west sides of Ap Bac, where additional reinforcements could be inserted to launch their attacks. In response, Vann asked his pilot to make low passes over the trees which covered Ap Bac. <b>Although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not see any Viet Cong positions, Vann knew there was a well-fortified position {{at the south end of}} the hamlet, due to the impact of the Viet Cong's firepower on the Civil Guards since the battle's inception. As Vann's L-19 aircraft flew over the western tree line, the Viet Cong watched from their foxholes, but held their fire because they knew the aircraft was trying to draw fire in order to mark their positions. Although Vann was suspicious, he decided it was a better landing zone because the area was tranquil despite the heavy fighting elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|Jørgen [...] "Benny" [...] Nielsen is a Danish former {{football}} player. His {{position on}} the field was usually striker, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> also <b>could</b> play as midfielder. Nielsen played 28 matches for Denmark, scoring 7 goals. He made his début against Scotland in a 1-0 loss.|$|R
6000|$|She {{named her}} pet [...] "Jim Crow" [...] because papa {{said that all}} crows were called Jim, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> never <b>could</b> find out the reason. But the name seemed to fit her pet as well as any, so Twinkle never bothered about the reason.|$|R
50|$|A 28-year-old English teacher named Tim Schrader {{agrees to}} smuggle 8 kilos of heroin into the U.S. to solve his {{financial}} problems. <b>Although</b> <b>he</b> knows <b>he</b> <b>could</b> receive the death penalty, {{the money is}} too tempting to resist.|$|R
5|$|During the campaign, Combs had {{advocated}} a progressive platform that included increased funding for education, highways, parks, industry, and airports. Soon after his election, he won {{approval for a}} three-percent sales tax to pay a bonus to military veterans, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have funded the bonuses with a one-percent tax. He had asked for the larger tax in order to fund his other priorities. As {{a result of the}} sales tax, Combs presided over the state's first billion-dollar budget. One study showed that Kentucky doubled its per capita expenditures between 1957 and 1962, growing its appropriations faster than any other state. Combs held large public relations events for each tax-funded project that was completed, declaring in dedication speeches that the sales tax had made the project possible.|$|E
5|$|Hirst {{received}} little coaching as a batsman. Physically brave, {{he was often}} at his best on pitches which were difficult for batting, and when his team faced a crisis. His usual approach was to bat aggressively. <b>Although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> play defensively if required, he preferred to attack when his team were in difficulties. He played a variety of strokes, but he favoured the on drive and particularly the pull and hook shots. He was able to pull and hook almost any ball delivered to him, {{making it difficult to}} place fielders effectively while he was batting. Only in Australia did this approach prove less successful. He also established a reputation as an outstanding fielder at mid off. In this position, he took many catches, often from hard drives in an era when batsmen played this shot very well.|$|E
5|$|The Oakwood City Council {{wanted the}} Playhouse as a {{community}} center. Thomas appeared before the council and assured them {{that it would not}} be damaged, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not disclose what he was intending to use it for. When Talbott Realty proved reluctant to sell, the United States Army Corps of Engineers condemned the property, which became Unit IV on 15 February 1944. Remodeling began on 17 March and the Production Group began moving in on 1 June. Three guard houses were added, along with a wire fence. Changes to the site were minimized in order to make it easier to restore later. Because it was located in a residential area, efforts were also made to minimize noise and other disruptions.|$|E
60|$|Roger {{told all}} he knew of the capital, and said that, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> himself <b>could</b> not say more than {{that it was a}} great city, he had heard that its {{population}} was nearly three hundred thousand; and that it certainly seemed to him fully three times as large as that of Tezcuco, where he said there were one hundred thousand people.|$|R
6000|$|You'll {{take back}} the Grand-duke? [...] It is not race he is poor in, [...] <b>Although</b> <b>he</b> never <b>could</b> brook [...] The patriot cousin at Turin. [...] His love of kin you discern, [...] By his hate of your flag and me-- [...] So decidedly apt to turn [...] All colours {{at the sight of}} the Three.[14] [...] You'll call back the Grand-duke.|$|R
60|$|Foster's {{first impulse}} was to drop into the ling, but he did not. If the men were {{following}} him, it would take them {{half an hour to}} reach the spot he occupied and, if necessary, the roughness of the ground would enable him to reach the edge of the moor without their seeing which way he went. Besides, since he would be visible as long as he stood up, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find out whether they were looking for him or not. They came nearer and then vanished, and he sat down and speculated about his line of retreat. Their disappearance was suspicious, and <b>although</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> baffle the rural police, it would be different if he had gamekeepers to deal with.|$|R
5|$|Ambrose's height, and the {{accuracy}} {{with which he}} bowled, {{made it difficult for}} batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries sparingly, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal sparring with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began and rubbed his hands to suggest that he would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping the air with his fists. With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his best when his team seemed likely to lose, and he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in the techniques of other batsmen.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his victory}} against Uthman Pasha, Zahir demanded Darwish Pasha vacate Sidon, {{which he did}} on 13 October. He {{returned}} two days later after receiving the backing of Emir Yusuf. Zahir decided to move against Emir Yusuf, and together with his ally Sheikh Nasif, he confronted him at Nabatieh on 20 October. Emir Yusuf's men numbered some 37,000. Zahir's Metawali cavalry engaged in a maneuver where they fled the battlefield in apparent defeat, {{only to have the}} pursuant troops of Emir Yusuf surrounded by Zahir's men, who dealt Emir Yusuf's army a decisive blow. Emir Yusuf thereafter retreated to his mountain village of Deir al-Qamar, while Sidon was left under the protection of Ali Jumblatt and 3,000 Druze defenders. However, with news of Zahir's victory, Ali Jumblatt and Darwish Pasha withdrew from Sidon, which was subsequently occupied by Zahir and Sheikh Nasif. Uthman Pasha and all of his sons were consequently dismissed from their posts by the Sublime Porte. <b>Although,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not capture Nablus and its hinterland, Zahir's domain by the end of 1771 extended from Sidon to Jaffa and included an influential presence in the Hauran plain.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black law clerk, an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. <b>Although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do little to free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – that someone in a position of power was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E
50|$|On August 10, 2010, {{after more}} than 6 years, Nicholas Merrill was {{partially}} released from his gag order and allowed to reveal his identity, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> still <b>could</b> not reveal what information the FBI sought from him. This was 3 years after Merrill won The Roger Baldwin 'Medal of Liberty' award from the ACLU, which had to present the award to an empty chair at the time.|$|R
60|$|But even {{kings and}} their {{descendants}} have their limitations, {{and at the end}} of a quarter of an hour Jerry was ripe to cease from his silence. With the going below of Skipper, evidently in great trouble, the light had gone out of the day for Jerry. He might have stalked the wild-dog, but no inducement lay there. Lerumie passed by unnoticed, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> knew <b>he</b> <b>could</b> bully him and make him give deck space. The myriad scents of the land entered his keen nostrils, but he made no note of them. Not even the flopping, bellying mainsail overhead, as the Arangi rolled becalmed, could draw a glance of quizzical regard from him.|$|R
60|$|So {{they went}} down together. Ten days later, all the {{families}} round came to pay visits of condolence; and to each Lisle said that, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> himself <b>could</b> not think of going out, at present, his friend Hallett, {{who had come to}} stay with him for a month, would be glad to join in any quiet festivity. So Hallett was frequently invited out, Lisle accompanying him only to the very quietest of dinners.|$|R
5|$|Montoya {{began to}} {{gradually}} {{pull away from}} Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Fisichella to take 14th place on lap two. Barrichello overtook Häkkinen at the Ostkurve corner to move into third one lap later. Further down the field, Button lost 13th position when he was passed by Panis on the same lap. On lap five, Panis made up a further position as he overtook Zonta for twelfth, while Bernoldi passed Button to take 14th. Barrichello moved into second position after he overtook Michael Schumacher at the Senna chicane on lap six. On the same lap, Zonta went into the rear of Verstappen's car, causing Zonta to lose his front wing. Verstappen fell behind Panis after the collision. Zonta made a pit stop for repairs, but retired after driving one exploratory lap. Verstappen made his pit stop and rejoined {{at the back of}} the field. Alesi passed Burti to move into 15th position on lap nine, and Panis overtook teammate Villeneuve for tenth place one lap later. On the tenth lap, Panis attempted to overtake Trulli for ninth by taking the inside line, but was unable to complete the manoveure. Panis again tried to pass Trulli but by taking the outside line on the next lap, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not execute the pass because of a lack of straightline speed. During the twelfth lap, Panis made his third attempt at passing Trulli and managed to get ahead of the Italian. Trulli pulled into the slipstream of Panis, and attempted to reclaim the position but spun at the Ostkurve corner, and fell to 17th.|$|E
25|$|In 1947 Tsien {{was granted}} a {{permanent}} resident permit, and in 1949 he applied for naturalization, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not obtain citizenship. Years later, his wife Jiang Ying {{said in an interview}} with Phoenix Television that Tsien could not raise the necessary funds.|$|E
25|$|After {{all this}} Troelstra was broken and stayed at home, but a party conference {{two weeks later}} {{received}} him with a standing ovation. <b>Although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> defend {{the position that the}} party had never had actual plans for a coup, his reputation had taken irreparable damage, {{both inside and outside the}} party.|$|E
25|$|McGrath {{played for}} Worcestershire in the 2000 English County Championship, proving both {{successful}} {{on the field}} and popular with the county's supporters. In 14 first-class games he took , including an outstanding innings return of 8–41 against Northamptonshire, as well as making his first ever first-class half-century (55 against Nottinghamshire). He also played a few games for Middlesex in 2004; <b>although</b> accurate, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> manage only nine wickets in four first-class appearances for the county.|$|R
5000|$|According to David Lemmon, with Harry Jupp {{he formed}} {{the first great}} opening {{partnership}} for Surrey, one which caused [...] "a sensation" [...] with [...] "their bright and attractive cricket, their long partnerships, by their speed between the wickets." [...] He {{was known as the}} Pocket Hercules, because <b>although</b> short <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hit powerfully. <b>He</b> was particularly strong on the off-side, and appeared to {{have plenty of time to}} play his shots.|$|R
5000|$|Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Egemen Bagis said in September 2013 that he {{believed}} prejudice by EU member states would ultimately prevent Turkey from ever joining the bloc, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> suggested it <b>could</b> have a [...] "very closely aligned" [...] relationship with the EU akin to Norway.|$|R
25|$|Warnapura captained Sri Lanka's first Test match, {{and also}} faced the first {{delivery}} and scored the first run for his team. He captained Sri Lanka {{in all the}} Tests he played, <b>although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not lead his team to victory in any of them. However, Sri Lanka won the first ODI match he captained. He has scored one half-century in ODI cricket.|$|E
25|$|Gnaeus Scipio, {{fearing that}} the Carthaginian army outnumbered his own, {{resolved}} {{to fight a}} naval battle. <b>Although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only man 35 quinqueremes (25 ships were sent back to Italy after a Carthaginian raid had caused severe casualties among the crews, and some sailors may have been posted in garrisons), the allied Greek city of Massilia had provided 20 ships for his fleet.|$|E
25|$|Kotomitsuki {{holds the}} record for most tournaments spent at sekiwake in the modern era. <b>Although</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only manage four wins at his first attempt at sekiwake, he was ranked there for 22 tournaments in total, {{including}} eleven in a row from November 2005 to July 2007. For much of that time he was consistent rather than spectacular, posting a succession of 8–7 scores in 2006.|$|E
50|$|McNeil {{would play}} a key role in Syracuse's first National Championship in the 2002-03 season. <b>Although</b> <b>he</b> still <b>could</b> not win the {{starting}} role back from Forth, McNeil proved to be a valued shot blocker off the bench, often being the last line of defense when Syracuse decided to use its full court press. In an upset of then-No. 2 Pittsburgh, McNeil, a career 49.1% free throw shooter, hit two key free throws, and added a game-winning tip.|$|R
50|$|Like his father, Qazi Mian Muhammad Amjad, he was {{an admirer}} of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan {{educational}} policies. <b>Although</b> <b>he</b> himself <b>could</b> not go to Aligarh, he sent his two elders sons, Qazi Altaf Hussain and Qazi Fiaz Hussain, to Aligarh Muslim University, and preferred Aligarh Muslim University to Government College Lahore, for his sons. His second son Qazi Fiaz Hussain, however left his studies incomplete at Aligarh University, and went to Sial Sharif and became a Sufi.|$|R
50|$|Vogel joined Swiss amateur club Meyrin in his youth, {{but made}} the cut into {{professional}} football by joining Grasshoppers. In his time at Grasshoppers, he usually played central defence or rightback <b>although</b> on occasion, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be called to feature in a central defensive midfield role.|$|R
