These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, bills which are flattened to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils.

5|$|Actual {{rates of}} {{diffusion}} and perfusion, and solubility of gases in specific physiological tissues are not generally known, and vary considerably. However mathematical {{models have been}} proposed that approximate the real situation to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> lesser extent. These models predict whether symptomatic bubble formation is likely to occur for a given dive profile. Algorithms based on these models produce decompression tables. In personal dive computers, they produce a real-time estimate of decompression status and display it for the diver.|$|E
5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies forward to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> lesser extent {{depending on the}} physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps {{reduce the amount of}} low frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} criticised by big game hunter and {{politician}} Theodore Roosevelt for its central assertion that {{every aspect of}} animal coloration is effective as camouflage. Roosevelt's detailed reply attacked the biased choice of examples to suit Abbott Thayer's thesis and the book's reliance on unsubstantiated claims in place of evidence. The book was more evenly criticised by zoologist and camouflage researcher Hugh Cott, who valued Thayer's work on countershading but regretted his overenthusiastic attempts to explain all animal coloration as camouflage. Thayer was mocked to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> lesser extent by other scientific reviewers.|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} efficacy of an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) using gonococcal pili 6650 as antigen was studied in asymptomatic women attending an STD clinic. Of the 182 women studied, gonorrhoea was diagnosed in 29 %. The value of the ELISA was calculated {{on the basis of}} four arbitrary cut-off points in the test. The best predictive values for a positive result (PV(+)) were obtained at an absorbance value of <b>A</b> <b>greater</b> than <b>or</b> equal to 1. 15 and <b>A</b> <b>greater</b> than <b>or</b> equal to 1. 30 and that for a negative result at <b>A</b> <b>greater</b> than <b>or</b> equal to 0. 85. When patients with a history of gonorrhoea were excluded, the PV(+) rose only at <b>A</b> <b>greater</b> than <b>or</b> equal to 1. 15 (not at <b>A</b> <b>greater</b> than <b>or</b> equal to 1. 30) and the PV(-) rose slightly. To be of use in the diagnosis of gonorrhoea in asymptomatic patients the ELISA should be used as follows: the result is positive at <b>A</b> <b>greater</b> than <b>or</b> equal to 1. 15 and negative at A less than 0. 85, the PV(+) then being 0. 52 and the PV(-) 0. 85. Whenever sera give a result between A = 0. 85 and A = 1. 15, the test should be repeated...|$|R

These are adapted for an aquatic existence, with webbed feet, bills that are flattened to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils. In Tasmania, 15 {{species have been}} recorded, of which one has been introduced and three are vagrants.|$|E

Forty-five confirmed species, two of questionable origin, {{and one of}} exotic origin have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E

5|$|The swans, {{ducks and}} geese are medium to large birds that are adapted to an aquatic {{existence}} with webbed feet and bills which are flattened to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> lesser extent. In many ducks the male is colourful while the female is dull brown. The diet consists {{of a variety of}} animals and plants. The family is well represented in the counties, especially in winter when large numbers visit from further north.|$|E
5|$|The tail appears {{naked and}} is shorter than or {{about as long}} as the head and body; it is longer in T.talamancae. Its {{coloration}} is variable; it is dark brown above and at the sides and light brown and often white to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> smaller extent below, and in some specimens the tail has the same color above and below. The scales on the tail are smaller than in T.talamancae.|$|E
5|$|Nest {{success in}} {{undisturbed}} sites is high, at 80–90%, but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land. The method {{and timing of}} mowing is crucial; mechanized mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks in a given site, and losses average 50% of first brood chicks and somewhat less than 40% of second brood chicks. The influence of weather on chick survival is limited; although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> lesser extent until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than}} the weather, with lower survival in large broods. The annual adult survival rate is under 30%, although some individuals may live for 5–7 years.|$|E
