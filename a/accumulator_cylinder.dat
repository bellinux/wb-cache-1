50|$|In 1987 an {{assisted}} {{chin and}} dip machine was launched under Gravitron name. The original Gravitron used a compressor, <b>accumulator,</b> and pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> to provide programmable assistance to an exerciser. The pneumatic Gravitron proved {{a little too}} complex to maintain for the typical health club and was later replaced with the Gravitron 2000 AT, a weight-stack version.|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematical}} modelling of a suspension unit is considered. The unit comprises a hydraulic cylinder connecting the vehicle {{body to the}} unsprung mass, two nitrogen-filled accumulator springs and two damper ports. The model takes the deflection rate as input and iteratively employs simple fluid dynamics theory to calculate the flow-rates from each <b>accumulator</b> to the <b>cylinder.</b> It calculates the pressure in the accumulators by time-integrating the flow rates to determine the gas volumes and then invoking ideal gas theory. This renders the dynamic force of the unit as output. Model predictions are compared with measurements. US Government through its European Research Office of the US Army[URL]...|$|R
25|$|Armstrong was {{responsible}} for developing the hydraulic accumulator. Where water pressure was not available on site {{for the use of}} hydraulic cranes, Armstrong often built high water towers to provide a supply of water at pressure. However, when supplying cranes for use at New Holland on the Humber Estuary, he was unable to do this because the foundations consisted of sand. After much careful thought he produced the weighted <b>accumulator,</b> a cast-iron <b>cylinder</b> fitted with a plunger supporting a very heavy weight. The plunger would slowly be raised, drawing in water, until the downward force of the weight was sufficient to force the water below it into pipes at great pressure. The accumulator was a very significant, if unspectacular, invention, which found many applications in the following years.|$|R

Aimed at compensating work capacity for the system, design and research on parameters as the bearing pressure, the initial state and the maximum flow of hydraulic <b>cylinder,</b> <b>accumulator</b> and other principal components have been made separately, and standardized design has been accomplished in accordance with relevant standards. Furthermore, calculus and verification for {{the capacity of the}} hydraulic system in different working stages have been made in order to calculate the pressure lose of the system and provide objective data for the hardware system design of the hydraulic components of the heave compensation system. </p...|$|R
50|$|Armstrong {{spent the}} next few decades {{constantly}} improving his crane design; - his most significant innovation was the hydraulic accumulator. Where water pressure was not available on site for the use of hydraulic cranes, Armstrong often built high water towers to provide a supply of water at pressure. However, when supplying cranes for use at New Holland on the Humber Estuary, he was unable to do this because the foundations consisted of sand. He eventually produced the hydraulic <b>accumulator,</b> a cast-iron <b>cylinder</b> fitted with a plunger supporting a very heavy weight. The plunger would slowly be raised, drawing in water, until the downward force of the weight was sufficient to force the water below it into pipes at great pressure. This invention allowed much larger quantities of water to be forced through pipes at a constant pressure, thus increasing the crane's load capacity considerably.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fluid-dynamic {{analysis of the}} hydraulic circuit of a shaking table for seismic tests; the model was developed adopting a commercial code. The aim {{of the study is}} to provide useful indications for the design of a new optimized control system. The model was developed taking into account all the components of the hydraulic circuit that is made of by the following main items: the axial piston pump, the pressure relief valve, the main control valve, the <b>accumulators,</b> the hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> with variable displacement and all the connecting pipes. Particular attention was given to the modelling of internal resistance of the hydraulic system, that can greatly affect the performance of the shaking table. It has also been accurately modelled the main valve dead zone to highlight its influence on the system dynamics. The results of numerical simulations obtained for different operational conditions are reported and compared with experimental data to show the validation and the performances of the developed model...|$|R
40|$|Modern flight {{training}} simulators must {{be equipped with}} long stroke six degree-of-freedom motion systems that have high dynamic response. For many years electro-hydraulic actuators in a Stewart platform configuration {{have been found to}} best meet the performance requirements. However, valve-controlled actuators are very inefficient leading to a large power consumption, and also the need for a substantial cooling system to remove waste energy (heat) from the hydraulic oil. This paper describes a new design of motion system that uses a controlled brushless motor for each actuator, with power transmission via directly driven pumps to conventional simulator hydraulic <b>cylinders.</b> <b>Accumulators</b> are used to store and later recycle high pressure oil when actuators retract. In this way, power consumption has been dramatically reduced (for example from 45 kW to 5 kW during one representative motion waveform), while retaining the proven characteristics of the cylinder drive. Power consumption is lower, by a factor of between 2 and 4, than an equivalent all-electric solution. The motion system will be supplied {{for the first time with}} Boeing 787 simulators to be delivered in 2008. Design details are given in this paper, together with predicted and measured power consumption during a variety of representative cyclic motions...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} article is to analyse the {{performances}} of a modern vehicle equipped with a novel suspension system linking front, rear, right and left cylinders via a semi-active hydraulic circuit, developed by the Tenneco Automotive company. In addition to improving the vehicle's vertical performances (in terms of comfort), both the stiff roll motion of the carbody and the soft wrap motion of the rear/front wheel-axle units can be obtained and tuned via eight electrovalves. The proposed system avoids the use of classical anti-roll bars, which would be incompatible with the wrap performance. A major problem of the project is to produce a realistic and efficient 3 D multibody dynamic model of an Audi A 6 coupled, at the equational level, with an hydraulic model of the suspension including <b>cylinders,</b> <b>accumulators,</b> valve characteristics, oil compressibility and pipe dynamics. As regards the hydraulic submodel, a particular {{attention is paid to}} assemble resistive components properly without resorting to the use of artificial volumes, as proposed by some software dealing with the dynamics of hydraulic systems. According to Tenneco Automotive requirements, this model must be produced in a Matlab/Simulink form, in particular for control purposes. Thanks to the symbolic approach underlying our multibody program; a unified hybrid model can be obtained as a unique plant dynamic block to be real-time integrated in the Simulink environment on a standard computer. Simulation results highlight the advantages of this new suspension system, in particular regarding the behaviour of the car which can remain stiff in roll for curve negotiation, while maintaining a soft wrap behaviour on uneven surfaces...|$|R
