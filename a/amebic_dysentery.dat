50|$|In {{the vast}} {{majority}} of cases, infection is asymptomatic and the carrier is unaware they are infected. However, in an estimated 10% of cases E. histolytica causes disease. Once the trophozoites are excysted they colonize the large bowel, remaining {{on the surface of the}} mucus layer and feeding on bacteria and food particles. Occasionally, and in response to unknown stimuli, trophozoites move through the mucus layer where they come in contact with the epithelial cell layer and start the pathological process. E. histolytica has a lectin that binds to galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine sugars on the surface of the epithelial cells, The lectin normally is used to bind bacteria for ingestion. The parasite has several enzymes such as pore forming proteins, lipases, and cysteine proteases, which are normally used to digest bacteria in food vacuoles but which can cause lysis of the epithelial cells by inducing cellular necrosis and apoptosis when the trophozoite comes in contact with them and binds via the lectin. The trophozoites will then ingest these dead cells. This damage to the epithelial cell layer attracts human immune cells and these in turn can be lysed by the trophozoite, which releases the immune cell's own lytic enzymes into the surrounding tissue, creating a type of chain reaction and leading to tissue destruction. This destruction manifests itself in the form of an 'ulcer' in the tissue, typically described as flask-shaped because of its appearance in transverse section. This tissue destruction can also involve blood vessels leading to bloody diarrhea, <b>amebic</b> <b>dysentery.</b> Occasionally, trophozoites enter the bloodstream where they are transported typically to the liver via the portal system. In the liver a similar pathological sequence ensues, leading to amebic liver abscesses. The trophozoites can also end up in other organs, sometimes via the bloodstream, sometimes via liver abscess rupture or fistulas. In all locations, similar pathology can occur.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Men {{are more}} than 7 {{times more likely to}} develop amebic liver abscess or <b>amebic</b> <b>dysentery</b> caused by Entamoeba histolytica than women. Because the {{complement}} system could {{play a key role in}} controlling amebiasis, we determined whether serum from men and women differ in the ability to kill amebic trophozoites. We found that serum from women was significantly more effective in killing E. histolytica trophozoites than serum from men, and this killing was complement dependent. Our results provide a possible explanation for the differential susceptibility of men and women to amebic liver abscess and amebic colitis. <b>Amebic</b> <b>dysentery</b> and amebic liver abscess caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 1 Interestingly, the prevalence of amebic liver abscess and <b>amebic</b> <b>dysentery</b> is between 5 - and 7 -fold higher in men than women. 2 The reason for the greater susceptibility to disease in men is un-known, particularly because there does not seem to be a dif-ference between men and women in the rates of intestinal colonization by E. histolytica. 2 To invade through the intesti-nal mucosa and survive within the portal circulation to estab-lish infection within the liver, E. histolytica trophozoites must resist killing by complement. 1 We tested the hypothesis that differences between men and women in the efficiency of complement-mediated killing of amebic trophozoites might explain the varying susceptibility of the sexes to amebic liver abscess and amebic colitis. We obtained serum samples from 100 consecutively en-rolled healthy volunteers from an area that is not endemic for amebiasis, and examined the efficiency of their sera in killing amebic trophozoites.

Cyanovirin-N cocaps the Gal/GalNAc adherence lectin, as well as glycoproteins containing O-phosphodiester-linked glycans recognized by an anti-proteophosphoglycan monoclonal antibody. Cyanovirin-N inhibits phagocytosis by E. histolytica trophozoites of mucin-coated beads, a surrogate assay for amebic virulence. For technical reasons, we used the plant lectin concanavalin A rather than cyanovirin-N to enrich secreted and membrane proteins for mass spectrometric identification. E. histolytica glycoproteins with occupied N-glycan sites include Gal/GalNAc lectins, proteases, and 17 previously hypothetical proteins. The latter glycoproteins, as well as 50 previously hypothetical proteins enriched by concanavalin A, may be vaccine targets as they are abundant and unique. In summary, the antiretroviral lectin cyanovirin-N binds to well-known and novel targets on the surface of E. histolytica that are rapidly replenished from large intracellular pools.

The induction of a mucosal antibody response capable of blocking amebic adhesion to intestinal cells could represent an approach to preventing E. histolytica infection and disease. Here we describe the expression of a chimeric protein containing an immunogenic dodecapeptide derived from the serine-rich E. histolytica protein (SREHP), fused to the cholera toxin B subunit (CtxB). The CtxB–SREHP- 12 chimeric protein was purified from Escherichia coli lysates and retained the critical GM 1 ganglioside-binding activity of the CtxB moiety. Mice fed the CtxB–SREHP- 12 fusion protein along with a subclinical dose of cholera toxin developed mucosal immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G and systemic antibody responses that recognized recombinant and native SREHP. Our study confirms the feasibility of inducing mucosal immune responses to immunogenic peptides by their genetic fusion to the CtxB subunit and identifies the CtxB–SREHP- 12 chimeric protein as a candidate oral vaccine to prevent E. histolytica infection.

40|$|Abstract: Entamoeba histolytica is an enteric tissue-invading {{protozoan}} parasite {{that can}} cause amebic colitis and liver abscess in humans. E. histolytica has the capability to kill colon epithelial cells in vitro; however, information regarding the role of calpain in colon cell death induced by ameba is limited. In this study, we investigated whether calpains {{are involved in the}} E. histolytica-induced cell death of HT- 29 colonic epithelial cells. When HT- 29 cells were co-incubated with E. histolytica, the propidium iodide stained dead cells markedly increased compared to that in HT- 29 cells incubated with medium alone. This pro-death effect induced by ameba was effectively blocked by pretreatment of HT- 29 cells with the calpain inhibitor, calpeptin. Moreover, knockdown of m- and µ-calpain by siRNA significantly reduced E. histolytica-induced HT- 29 cell death. These results suggest that m- and µ-calpain may be involved in colon epithelial cell death induced by E. histolytica.

In most cases, this extracellular parasite colonizes the colon by high affinity binding to MUC 2 mucin without disease symptoms, whereas in some cases, Eh triggers an aggressive inflammatory response upon invasion of the colonic mucosa. The specific host-parasite factors critical for disease pathogenesis are still not well characterized. From the parasite, the signature events that lead to disease progression are cysteine protease cleavage of the C-terminus of MUC 2 that dissolves the mucus layer followed by Eh binding and cytotoxicity of the mucosal epithelium. The host mounts an ineffective excessive host pro-inflammatory response following contact with host cells that causes tissue damage and participates in disease pathogenesis as Eh escapes host immune clearance by mechanisms that are not completely understood. Ameba can modulate or destroy effector immune cells by inducing neutrophil apoptosis and suppressing respiratory burst or nitric oxide (NO) production from macrophages. Eh adherence to the host cells also induce multiple cytotoxic effects that can promote cell death through phagocytosis, apoptosis or by trogocytosis (ingestion of living cells) that might play critical roles in immune evasion.

Sequences of PCR products using primers flanking the highly polymorphic spacer of EhJacob 2 {{may be used to}} distinguish Entamoeba isolates. Antibodies to the EhJacob 2, EhJessie 3, and chitinase each recognize cyst walls of clinical isolates of Entamoeba. While numerous sera from patients with amebic intestinal infections and liver abscess recognize recombinant EhJacob 1 and EhJessie 3 lectins, few of these sera recognize recombinant EhJacob 2. Conclusions/Significance: The EhJacob 2 lectin binds chitin and is polymorphic, and Jacob 2, Jessie 3, and chitinase are present in cyst walls of clinical isolates of Entamoeba. These results suggest there are substantial similarities between cysts of the human pathogen (Eh) and the in vitro model (Ei), even though there are quantitative and qualitative differences i...|$|E
40|$|Cysteine proteinases are {{hypothesized}} {{to be important}} virulence factors of Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of <b>amebic</b> <b>dysentery</b> and liver abscesses. The release of a histolytic cysteine proteinase from E. histolytica correlates with the pathogenicity of both axenic strains and recent clinical isolates as determined by clinical history of invasive disease, zymodeme analysis, and cytopathic effect. We now show that pathogenic isolates have a unique cysteine proteinase gene (ACP 1). Two other cysteine proteinase genes (ACP 2, ACP 3) are 85 % identical {{to each other and}} are present in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic isolates. ACP 1 is only 35 and 45 % identical in sequence to the two genes found in all isolates and is present on a distinct chromosome-size DNA fragment. Presence of the ACP 1 gene correlates with increased proteinase expression and activity in pathogenic isolates as well as cytopathic effect on a fibroblast monolayer, an in vitro assay of virulence. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of the ACP 1 proteinase gene reveals homology with cysteine proteinases released by activated macrophages and invasive cancer cells, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of tissue invasion. The observation that a histolytic cysteine proteinase gene is present only in pathogenic isolates of E. histolytica suggests that this aspect of virulence in amebiasis is genetically predetermined...|$|E
40|$|The {{infectious}} and diagnostic form of Entamoeba histolytica (Eh), {{cause of}} <b>amebic</b> <b>dysentery</b> and liver abscess, is the quadranucleate cyst. The cyst wall of Entamoeba invadens (Ei), {{a model for}} Eh, is composed of chitin fibrils and three sets of chitin-binding lectins that cross-link chitin fibrils (multivalent Jacob lectins), self-aggregate (Jessie lectins), and remodel chitin (chitinase). The goal here was to determine how well the Ei model applies to Entamoeba cysts from humans. An Eh Jacob lectin (EhJacob 2) has three predicted chitin-binding domains surrounding a large, Ser-rich spacer. Recombinant EhJacob 2 made in transfected Eh trophozoites binds to particulate chitin. Sequences of PCR products using primers flanking the highly polymorphic spacer of EhJacob 2 {{may be used to}} distinguish Entamoeba isolates.

40|$|The {{unicellular}} eukaryote Entamoeba histolytica {{is a human}} parasite {{that causes}} <b>amebic</b> <b>dysentery</b> and liver abscess. A genome-wide analysis of gene expression modulated by intestinal colonization and invasion identified an upregulated transcript that encoded a putative high-mobility-group box (HMGB) protein, EhHMGB 1. We tested if EhHMGB 1 encoded a functional HMGB protein and determined its role in control of parasite gene expression. Recombinant EhHMGB 1 was able to bend DNA in vitro, a characteristic of HMGB proteins. Core conserved residues required for DNA bending activity in other HMGB proteins were demonstrated by mutational analysis to be essential for EhHMGB 1 activity. EhHMGB 1 was also able to enhance the binding of human p 53 to its cognate DNA sequence in vitro, which is expected for an HMGB 1 protein. Confocal microscopy, using antibodies against the recombinant protein, confirmed its nuclear localization. Overexpression of EhHMGB 1 in HM 1 :IMSS trophozoites led to modulation of 33 transcripts involved {{in a variety of}} cellular functions. Of these, 20 were also modulated at either day 1 or day 29 in the mouse model of intestinal amebiasis. Notably, four transcripts with known roles in virulence, including two encoding Gal/GalNAc lectin light chains, were modulated in response to EhHMGB 1 overexpression. We concluded that EhHMGB 1 was a bona fide HMGB protein with the capacity to recapitulate part of the modulation of parasite gene expression seen during adaptation to the host intestine...|$|E
40|$|Trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica, the {{protozoan}} parasite {{that causes}} <b>amebic</b> <b>dysentery,</b> phagocytose {{bacteria in the}} colonic lumen and erythrocytes (RBC) in host tissues. Because tissue invasion is an evolutionary dead end, {{it is likely that}} amebic pathogenicity is coincidentally selected, i. e., the same methods used to kill bacteria in the colonic lumen are used by parasites to damage host cells and cause disease. In support of this idea, the amebic lectin and pore-forming peptide are involved in binding and killing, respectively, bacteria and host epithelial cells. Here amebic phagocytosis of bacteria, RBC, and mucin-coated beads was disrupted by overexpression of E. histolytica p 21 (racA-V 12), a ras-family protein involved in selection of sites of actin polymerization, which had been mutated to eliminate its GTPase activity. p 21 (racA-V 12) transformants were also defective in capping and cytokinesis, while pinocytosis of fluorescent dextrans was not affected. Wortmannin, a fungal inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase, markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria, RBC, and mucin-coated beads by wild-type amebae. In contrast to p 21 (racA-V 12) overexpression, wortmannin abolished amebic pinocytosis of dextrans but had no inhibitory effects on capping. Inhibition of amebic vacuolar acidification by bafilomycin also decreased bacterial and RBC uptake. These results, which demonstrate similarities between mechanisms of phagocytosis of bacteria and RBC by amebae and macrophages, support the idea of coincidental selection of amebic genes encoding proteins that mediate destruction of host cells...|$|E
