5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their <b>attention</b> <b>spans,</b> as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} {{chapters}} on memory, imitation and suggestion, perceptual illusions, and esthetics. In these he refuted {{the idea that}} experience was just the external environment acting on and molding a mind working as a passive recipient. Stratton saw the sensation of time as being multidimensional, in analogy with perception of space. That we could simultaneously hear separately, without synthesizing, multiple mixed tones meant our experiences did not necessarily come in single file temporally. To Stratton this meant time had multiple dimensions, since simultaneous events could not be distinguished on the one past-present-future dimension of time alone. He did not address how the other dimensions could be in temporal-space if the events were indistinguishable temporally to begin with. He also analyzed poetic measure as mathematically connected to the waxing and waning span of attention, tying the arts to psychology. This last was rebutted by Charles Samuel Myers, writing in Nature, who saw poetry and its rhythm as too complex a subject to be reduced to the arithmetic of <b>attention</b> <b>spans.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} {{controversy}} {{is the relationship}} between smoking and sensory gating in schizophrenia. Nicotine may help improve auditory gating, the ability to screen out intrusive environmental sounds. This may help improve <b>attention</b> <b>spans</b> and reduce auditory hallucinations, allowing people with schizophrenia to perceive the environment more effectively and engage in smoother motor functions. However, research shows this effect alone cannot account for increased smoking rates.|$|E

Whether this relation is also found in Dutch, a more transparent orthography, was examined in two studies. Two unresolved issues are addressed. First, whether the contribution of visual <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> to reading was independent of rapid naming. Participants were 117 second graders and 111 fifth graders.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} students' <b>Attention</b> <b>Span</b> and Reading Comprehension level amongst {{the sample of}} 53 full-time TESL postgraduate students from the Faculty of Education, Section 17, UiTM Shah Alam. Using an <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> test and a reading comprehension test, the results were then used {{to find out the}} correlation between <b>Attention</b> <b>Span</b> Level and Reading Comprehension Level. The students were also asked to rate their own reading ability. The result from the Self-Reported Reading Ability and Reading Comprehension level were used to find out the correlation between them. The CGPA given by the samples were used as a dependent variable and the <b>Attention</b> <b>Span</b> Level were used as the independent variable in the regression analysis conducted. It was found out {{that the majority of the}} samples' <b>Attention</b> <b>Span</b> Level was low but the Reading Comprehension Level was at an advanced level. The correlation between <b>Attention</b> <b>Span</b> Level and Reading Comprehension Level was weak and not significant (rs = 0. 180, P> 0. 05). This showed that both level didn't correlate with one another. However, the correlation between Self-Reported Reading Ability and Reading Comprehension Level of the students showed a moderate but significant result (rs = 0. 366, P> 0. 05). This proved that the students know how to evaluate reading performance and are aware of their own reading capability. It was also found out that the <b>Attention</b> <b>Span</b> level cannot be used to predict the Achievement which was based on the CGPA. Since the data proved that <b>Attention</b> <b>Span</b> Test were not aligned with the Reading Comprehension Test, future researchers should try other methods and also uses bigger scale sample from different level of education such as primary, secondary, diploma or degree in order to find a better results to investigate the relationship between <b>Attention</b> <b>Span</b> and Reading Comprehension...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} has shown visual <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> to be a factor, distinct from phonological skills, that explains single-word identification (pseudo-word/word reading) performance in dyslexia. Yet, {{little is known}} about how well visual <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> explains text comprehension. Observing reading comprehension in a sample of 105 high school students with dyslexia, we used a pathway analysis to examine the direct and indirect path between visual <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> and reading comprehension while controlling for other factors such as phonological awareness, letter identification, short-term memory, IQ and age. Integrating phonemic decoding efficiency skills in the analytic model, this study aimed to disentangle how visual <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> and phonological skills work together in reading comprehension for readers with dyslexia. We found visual <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> to have a significant direct effect on more difficult reading comprehension but not on an easier level. It also had a significant direct effect on pseudo-word identification but not on word identification. In addition, we found that visual <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> indirectly explains reading comprehension through pseudo-word reading and word reading skills. This study supports the hypothesis that {{at least part of the}} dyslexic profile can be explained by visual attention abilities...|$|R

The results showed that each of the behavioral variables (temper frequency, temper intensity, irritability, crying, and demanding attention) had a significant inverse relationship with <b>attention</b> <b>span.</b> In other words, the twin with longer <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> was better able to remain absorbed in a particular activity without distraction, and was also the less temperamental twin.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA steady {{increase}} in reading speed is {{the hallmark of}} normal reading acquisition. However, little is known of the influence of visual attention capacity on children's reading speed. The number of distinct visual elements that can be simultaneously processed at a glance (dubbed the visual <b>attention</b> <b>span),</b> predicts single-word reading speed in both normal reading and dyslexic children. However, the exact processes that account for the relationship between the visual <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> and reading speed remain to be specified. We used the Theory of Visual Attention to estimate visual processing speed and visual short-term memory capacity from a multiple letter report task in eight and nine year old children. The visual <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> and text reading speed were also assessed. Results showed that visual processing speed and visual short term memory capacity predicted the visual <b>attention</b> <b>span.</b> Furthermore, visual processing speed predicted reading speed, but visual short term memory capacity did not. Finally, the visual <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> mediated the effect of visual processing speed on reading speed. These results suggest that visual attention capacity could constrain reading speed in elementary school children...|$|R
25|$|Forums {{prefer a}} premise of open and free {{discussion}} and often adopt de facto standards.

Poor understanding of differences in values of the participants is a common problem on forums. Because replies to a topic are often worded aimed at someone's point of view, discussion will usually go slightly off into several directions as people question each other's validity, sources and so on.

25|$|Current {{models of}} ADHD {{suggest that it}} is {{associated}} with functional impairments in some of the brain's neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving dopamine and norepinephrine. Psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine may be effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. Approximately70% of those who use these stimulants see improvements in ADHD symptoms. Children with ADHD who use stimulant medications generally have better relationships with peers and family members, generally perform better in school, are less distractible and impulsive, and have longer <b>attention</b> <b>spans.</b> People with ADHD have an increased risk of substance use disorders, and stimulant medications reduce this risk. Some studies suggest that since ADHD diagnosis is increasing significantly around the world, using the drug may cause more harm than good in some populations with ADHD. This applies to people who potentially may be experiencing a different issue and are misdiagnosed with ADHD. The drug is used to treat symptoms that could be better treated through a different, such as behavioural, intervention. People in this category can then experience negative side-effects of the drug which worsen their condition, and make it harder for them to receive adequate care as providers around them may believe the drugs are sufficient and the problem lies with the user.|$|E

Thirty-eight children with ADHD and sixteen controls were administered tests of four components of <b>attention</b> (viz., <b>attention</b> <b>span,</b> focused <b>attention,</b> selective attention and shifting attention) and two subtests (viz., reading and spelling) from the WRAT- 3. The children with ADHD-Combined subtype were found to show deficits in <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> and focused <b>attention,</b> while the children with ADHD-Inattentive subtype were found to show deficits in shifting attention, and subtler deficits in <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> and focused <b>attention.</b> Measures of <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> {{were found to be}} significant predictors of reading ability, and measures of <b>attention</b> <b>span</b> and selective <b>attention</b> were found to be significant predictors of spelling ability.

Morrow stated that the basis of Zigler's criticism was concern {{that the federal government}} would transfer their funding of Head Start to CTW. [...] Also according to Morrow, these studies were utilized by critics in Sesame Street's later years, especially by child development psychologists Jerome and Dorothy G. Singer, who insisted the television shortened children's <b>attention</b> <b>spans,</b> and by author Neil Postman in his book Amusing Ourselves to Death, who believed that television could not teach children.

Difficult vocabulary words such as [...] "ostensible" [...] and [...] "presaged" [...] were eliminated, as was slang. As {{a result of the}} new, more streamlined writing style, the books focus more on non-stop action than on building atmosphere, and [...] "prolonged suspense [...] evaporated."

She was a proponent and follower of the teaching philosophy of Friedrich Fröbel. Smith incorporated Fröbel's ideas that childhood is a universal experience in which children learn by imitation, using their natural abilities. Her compositions also recognized that children learn by movement and play, but have limited <b>attention</b> <b>spans.</b> Thus, the compositions she created were usually short melodies, with limited vocal ranges, and were easy to sing. The songs were in major keys, typically C, F, and G and extended only from C1 to F2. Most melodies were made in stepped triads and provided pauses for activity. For example, in her song [...] "The Wind Mill" [...] there is an eight measure rest {{for the children to}} make the motions of the turning blades.|$|E
500|$|From {{its first}} episode, Sesame Street has {{structured}} its format by using [...] "a strong visual style, fast-moving action, humor, and music," [...] {{as well as}} animation and live-action short films. When Sesame Street premiered, most researchers believed that young children did not have long <b>attention</b> <b>spans,</b> therefore the new show's producers were concerned that an hour-long show would not hold their audience's attention. At first, the show's [...] "street scenes"—the action taking place on its set—consisted of character-driven interactions and were not written as ongoing stories. Instead, they consisted of individual, curriculum-based segments which were interrupted by [...] "inserts" [...] consisting of puppet sketches, short films, and animations. This structure allowed the producers to use a mixture of styles and characters, and to vary the show's pace. By season 20, research had shown that children were able to follow a story, and the street scenes, while still interspersed with other segments, became evolving storylines.|$|E
