5|$|Australia allows gay men {{and lesbians}} to serve openly. Openly gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service did not have any negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention, and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lesbians</b> <b>and</b> gay men {{experience}} {{psychological distress}} due to sexual prejudice. Variables that predict {{negative attitudes toward}} gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> are masculinity, religious background, conservative political affiliation, lack of contact with gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians,</b> age, <b>and</b> the belief that homosexuality is a choice. However, one important variable that has demonstrated inconsistent results is {{the sex of the}} person holding the attitude. Many studies have examined and proposed reasons why there are sex differences related to attitudes toward gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians,</b> but none has taken into account whether attitude scales measure the same construct equally between males and females. This study included 453 female and 333 male heterosexual college students from a university on the Texas/Mexico border who completed the Modern Homonegativity Scale (MHS), assessing their attitudes toward gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians.</b> The measurement invariance of the MHS was examined among groups of heterosexual men and heterosexual women. Findings indicate that the MHS demonstrated full invariance of factor loadings and partial invariance among latent intercepts across all group comparisons. Moreover, heterosexual men compared to heterosexual women held more negative attitudes toward gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> at the latent mean level. There were no differences in heterosexual males 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians,</b> <b>and</b> no differences in heterosexual females 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians.</b> This study comprises a partial cross-cultural replication of existing work. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{differences}} in four aspects of job satisfaction between gay men/lesbians and heterosexuals. The analysis results suggest that gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> are less satisfied with their jobs, by all job satisfaction measures, than heterosexual employees, all other factors being held constant. Gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> who have disclosed their sexual orientation at their present job are more satisfied with their jobs than those who have not. In addition, gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> who disclosed their sexual orientation at their current workplace longer ago are more satisfied with their jobs than gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> who disclosed their sexual orientation more recently. Moreover, adverse mental health symptoms have the same negative impact on employees' job satisfaction regardless of sexual orientation. Furthermore, gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> receive lower wages than comparable heterosexual employees. Whilst, the wage gap due to sexual orientation is greater {{in the group of}} very dissatisfied men than in the group of very satisfied men, and gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> who have disclosed their sexual orientation at their present job receive lower wages than those who have not, but they still have higher levels of job satisfaction. It seems that the effect of disclosure on job satisfaction is the net effect of the connections between disclosure and job satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 This {{research}} {{investigates the}} experiences of female allies of gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians.</b> A naturalistic <b>and</b> grounded theory paradigm is employed in this qualitative study. The participants are five female allies of gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> from the Southeastern region of the United States. The participants share their experiences as allies of gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> during two in-depth interviews. Semi-structured interview questions developed by the researcher provide the format for the interviews. Interviews are tape recorded and transcribed. Concepts and themes emerge from initial interviews, which then guide {{the second set of}} interviews. Data is coded according to the themes that emerge. Findings reveal the following themes: (1) Way of Being; (2) Awareness; (3) Commitment; and (4) Integration.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between an individual's attitude toward gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> their identity development. The sample included 440 undergraduates from a university in the northeast Texas area. Many, if not all, {{of the factors that}} are associated with negative attitudes toward gays <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> (i. e., restrictive gender-role attitudes, high levels of authoritarianism, perceptions of negative attitudes toward homosexuals within their peer group, little or no contact with homosexuals, and conservative religious ideologies) have a logical relation to identity development. Furthermore, the various functions that attitudes toward gays <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> can serve (e. g., value-expression, group membership) were hypothesized to be especially attractive for persons in specific identity statuses. Thus, the case was made that identity development may be a valuable framework in which to understand attitudes toward gays <b>and</b> <b>lesbians.</b> In the current study, attitudes toward gays <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> were related to identity development, though the relationship is complex. When comparing persons who were higher and lower on absolutism, attitude toward gays <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> were most similar in achieved identity groups, while those who were foreclosed were the most disparate. In the interaction between identity, absolutism and gender role stereotyping, some groups utilized their attitude to express values more than other groups. Clinical implications as well as limitations of the study are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In this Article I comment upon Professor Terry Kogan 2 ̆ 7 s paper 2 ̆ 2 Legislative Violence Against <b>Lesbians</b> <b>and</b> Gay Men, 2 ̆ 2 {{in which}} he {{analyzes}} the legislative process surrounding the passage of hate crimes legislation in Utah. Through {{an analysis of the}} gay bashing that took place within the legislative debate, Professor Kogan argues that the Utah legislature 2 ̆ 7 s removal of all references to gays <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> in the legislation was significant both because it reinforced sterotypical and negative perceptions of gays <b>and</b> <b>lesbians,</b> <b>and</b> because it suggested that violence against gays <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> was, at best, not of concern to, and at worst, actively encouraged by, the state.

5|$|Save Our Children, Inc. was a {{political}} coalition formed in 1977 in Miami, Florida to overturn a recently legislated county ordinance that banned discrimination in areas of housing, employment, and public accommodation based on sexual orientation.

It was a well-organized campaign that initiated a bitter political fight between unprepared gay activists and highly motivated Christian fundamentalists.
