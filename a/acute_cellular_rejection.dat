40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{indications}} and results of tacrolimus as rescue therapy for <b>acute</b> <b>cellular</b> or chronic <b>rejection</b> in liver transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen liver transplant recipients who underwent rescue therapy with tacrolimus between March 1995 and August 1999 were retrospectively studied. The treatment indication, patients, and graft situation were recorded as of October 31 st, 1999. The response to tacrolimus {{was defined as}} patient survival with a functional graft and histological reversal of <b>acute</b> <b>cellular,</b> or for chronic rejection, bilirubin serum levels decreasing to up to twice the upper normal limit. RESULTS: Fourteen cases (77. 8 %) presented a good response. The response rate for the different indications was: (1) <b>acute</b> <b>cellular</b> + sepsis - 0 / 1 case; (2) recurrent <b>acute</b> <b>cellular</b> - 1 / 1 case; (3) OKT 3 -resistant <b>acute</b> <b>cellular</b> - 2 / 2 cases; (4) steroid-resistant <b>acute</b> <b>cellular</b> + active viral infection - 3 / 3 cases; (5) chronic rejection - 8 / 11 cases (72. 7 % response rate).

40|$|Background. Tricuspid valve {{regurgitation}} (TR) after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) is common. The aims of {{this study}} were to determine the prevalence of TR after OHT, to examine the correlation between its development and various variables, and to determine its outcomes. Methods. All 163 [*]OHT patients who were followed up between 1988 and 2009 for a minimal period of 12 months were divided into those with no TR/mild TR and those with at least mild-moderate TR, as assessed by doppler echocardiography. These groups were compared regarding preoperative hemodynamic variables, surgical technique employed, number of endomyocardial biopsies, number of <b>acute</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>rejections,</b> incidence of graft vasculopathy, and clinical outcomes.

The development of late TR was found by univariate, but not multivariate, analysis to be significantly correlated with the biatrial surgical technique () and the presence of graft vasculopathy (). TR development was found to be correlated with the need for tricuspid valve surgery but not with an increased mortality. Conclusions.

5000|$|In {{light of}} the {{observations}} in relation to its use in asthma, the extension of ciclosporin's use to treat early rejection in the lungs was an obvious one, especially considering the increase in lung transplants performed in the USA and Europe since the mid-1980s.

Most of these early efforts were carried out by or associated with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Unfortunately, the apparent success of aerosolized ciclosporin in animal studies and these early clinical studies was not duplicated in a subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled trial of aerosolized ciclosporin that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Nevertheless, a robust effect was noted in chronic rejection and survival and this has warranted more detailed investigations of aerosolized drug to treat or prevent the varied conditions of rejection.|$|E

40|$|Jayme E Locke, Andrew L SingerJohns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Department of Surgery, Division of Transplantation, Baltimore, MD, USAAbstract: The {{introduction}} of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) based immunosuppression has revolutionized {{the field of}} liver transplantation by dramatically reducing the incidence of <b>acute</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>rejection</b> and prolonging patient and allograft survival. However, the {{introduction of}} CNIs has also come {{at the price of}} increased patient morbidity, particularly with regard to the well-known nephrotoxic effects of the medications. In an effort to minimize the adverse effects, immunosuppression regimen have evolved to include the use of various induction agents and purine synthesis inhibitors to limit the dose of CNI necessary to achieve low <b>acute</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>rejection</b> rates. Careful assessments of risks and benefits are needed as these newer agents have their own side effect profiles.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the outcomes of spousal donor (SD) with related donor (RD) kidney transplants performed at our center between January 2010 and October 2012. A total of 323 adult, ABO-compatible kidney transplants (SD 150 [46. 4 %], RD 173 [53. 6 %]) were included. Data on outcomes at 6 months post-transplant was collected retrospectively (2010 - 2011) and prospectively (January-October 2012). Majority of the donors (SD 88 %, RD 72. 2 %) were females. In the SD group, donors were younger (SD 35. 6 ± 8. 2 years, RD 45. 2 ± 11. 5 years; P < 0. 0001), whereas recipients were older (SD 42. 2 ± 8. 3 years, RD 30. 0 ± 9. 5 years; P < 0. 0001). A significantly higher proportion of patients in the SD group were given induction therapy (43 % vs 12 %; P < 0. 001). Biopsy proven acute rejections were more common in the RD group (16 % vs 28. 3 %; P = 0. 01). Majority (80. 8 %) of the acute rejections occurred in the first 2 weeks post-transplant in both groups. Isolated <b>acute</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>rejections</b> (ACRs) and isolated antibody mediated rejections constituted 50 % and 25 % of rejection episodes in both groups, whereas the remainder had histological evidence of both.

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{introduction}} of many improved immunosuppressive agents {{for use in}} transplantation, acute rejection affects up to 55 % of lung transplant recipients within {{the first year after}} transplant. Acute lung allograft rejection is defined as perivascular or peribronchiolar mononuclear inflammation. Although histopathologic signs of rejection often resolve with treatment, the frequency and severity of acute rejections represent the most important risk factor for the subsequent development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), a condition of progressive airflow obstruction that limits survival to only 50 % at 5 years after lung transplantation. Recent evidence demonstrates that peribronchiolar mononuclear inflammation (also known as lymphocytic bronchiolitis) or even a single episode of minimal perivascular inflammation significantly increase the risk for BOS. We comprehensively review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, histopathologic features, and mechanisms of <b>acute</b> <b>cellular</b> lung <b>rejection.</b> In addition, we consider emerging evidence that humoral rejection occurs in lung transplantation, characterized by local complement activation or the presence of antibody to donor human leukocyte antigens (HLA).

An average of 16. 5 ± 9. 0 % of pretransplantation peripheral blood mononuclear cell Treg cell were donor-reactive, compared with 3. 8 % ± 2. 9 % of CD 4 Tconv and 3. 4 ± 2. 6 % of CD 8 T cells. These values were largely unchanged after transplantation. Donor-reactive CD 4 Tconv and CD 8 T cell frequencies both increased 1. 5 -fold (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 1. 3 - 1. 6; P < 0. 001 and 95 % CI, 1. 2 - 1. 6; P = 0. 007, respectively) during grade A 2 rejection compared with no rejection.

Therefore the aim of this dissertation was to measure fibrosis, collagen type III and IV quantita-tively in endomyocardial biopsy specimens (EMB) over a period of five years after heart trans-plantation and to analyze the prognostic value of immunohistochemistry staining compared to the Sirius-red staining of fibrosis used routinely. Furthermore the possible influence of different fac-tors (histopathological phenomena, myocardial structure at the time of transplantation, age of donor and patient at the time of transplantation) on the postoperative changes in the ECM were analyzed. In total, 274 EMB of 77 patients who underwent a heart transplantation between 2003 and 2006 were evaluated on the date of their transplantation, 4 weeks, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years after heart transplantation. Computer-based histomorphometrical analyses were used to measure the mean rates of collagen III, IV and myocardial fibrosis in an area of 1 mm 2 for each EMB. The interstitial ECM of the myocardium showed a substantial fluctuation in its structure already at the time of transplantation. Especially in the first year the postoperative course of the mean fibrosis showed an increasing rate, whereas for the long-term period the rate remained quite sta-ble. Collagen III showed a slight decrease in the first postoperative year, but increased signifi-cantly over the period. Collagen IV rose even more clearly and continuously. In comparison of the different staining methods, immunohistochemistry seems to reflect the structure of the inter-stitial ECM better than Sirius-red staining. With respect to the age there was no statistically significant evidence that a younger age of the patient or donor could have a protectice effect. Neither <b>acute</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>rejections</b> nor pathological changes in the size of cardiac myocytes had a statistically significant influence on the course of the ECM-components. Whereas patients with antibody-mediated rejection or microvasculopathy tend to have higher rates of fibrosis, collagen III or IV. Finally it remains unclear if the measured structural changes in the ECM are specific for the post-operative course after heart transplantation or have to be seen as physiological aging of the myo-cardium...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well know}} that anti-HLA {{antibodies}} {{are an important}} obstacle in kidney transplantation. Our aim was to study the clinical impact of pretransplant donor specific anti-HLA antibodies (HLA-DSA), in highly sensitized (HS) patients. We analyzed retrospectively the day-of-transplant sera by Luminex Single Antigen Assay (LSA) in HS patients, {{and the results were}} correlated with episodes of humoral and <b>cellular</b> <b>rejection</b> as well as with graft and patient survival. All HS subjects received the same induction therapy and rejection episodes were biopsy proven. Thirteen patients (56. 5 %) preformed HLA-DSA, and we observed higher incidence of acute rejection in aforementioned patients than in the pre-transplant negatives DSA recipients (77 % versus 30 %,). The one-year graft survival was significantly reduced in positive pre-transplant HLA-DSA patients (60 % versus 100 %, Breslow). The positive predicted value of HLA-DSA in relation to rejection reached 100 % if patients lost their previous graft in the first year after transplant. Among anti-HLA antibodies present in patients before transplant, HLA-DSA were significantly associated with high risk of <b>acute</b> humoral and <b>cellular</b> <b>rejection</b> and reduced graft survival in posttransplant outcome. The negative impact of these antibodies was even higher when patients suffered an early loss of the previous transplant...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{allograft}} nephropathy (CAN) is {{the leading}} cause of late allograft loss after renal transplantation (RT), which continues to remain an unresolved problem. A rat model of CAN was first described in 1969 by White et al. Although the rat model of RT can be technically challenging, it is attractive because the pathogenesis of CAN is similar to that following human RT and the pathological features of CAN develop within months as compared with years in human RT. The rat model of RT is considered as a useful investigational tool in the field of experimental transplantation research. We have reviewed the literature on studies of rat RT reporting the donor and recipient strain combinations that have investigated resultant survival and histological outcomes. Several different combinations of inbred and outbred rat combinations have been reported to investigate the multiple aspects of transplantation, including <b>acute</b> <b>rejection,</b> <b>cellular</b> and humoral <b>rejection</b> mechanisms and their treatments, CAN, and potential targets for its prevention...|$|R
