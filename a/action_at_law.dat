Under Arkansas Civil Code sec. 525, if a person usurps an office or franchise to which he is not entitled, an <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>law</b> may be instituted against him either by the State or by the party rightly entitled to the office. On October 8, 1873, Baxter filed a plea of non-jurisdiction, but he believed that the court might decide against him. He issued a telegram to President Grant informing him of the basic situation in Arkansas and asked for federal troops to help him maintain the peace. Grant denied his request.|$|E
25|$|There are {{situations}} where the Court has original jurisdiction, such as when two states have a dispute against each other, or {{when there is a}} dispute between the United States and a state. In such instances, a case is filed with the Supreme Court directly. Examples of such cases include United States v. Texas, a case to determine whether a parcel of land belonged to the United States or to Texas, and Virginia v. Tennessee, a case turning on whether an incorrectly drawn boundary between two states can be changed by a state court, and whether the setting of the correct boundary requires Congressional approval. Although it has not happened since 1794 in the case of Georgia v. Brailsford, parties in an <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>law</b> in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction may request that a jury determine issues of fact. Two other original jurisdiction cases involve colonial era borders and rights under navigable waters in New Jersey v. Delaware, and water rights between riparian states upstream of navigable waters in Kansas v. Colorado.|$|E

However, the majority noted that [...] "we do not reach this issue today" [...] because the District Court had ruled against the counties laches defense, and the counties had not raised {{the issue in the}} Second Circuit.

[...] The same footnote cited [...] Ewert v.

2500|$|Since {{actions to}} enforce {{collective}} bargaining agreements were unknown in 18th-century England (such agreements were unlawful at the time), the union {{argued that the}} action brought by the plaintiffs was, in essence, an attempt to vacate an arbitration award, which historically was considered an action in equity. [...] Marshall rejected this argument because {{there had been no}} arbitration with regards to the union’s duty of fair representation. [...] The union further argued that the suit was comparable to an action for breach of fiduciary duty (e.g. a suit concerning a trust), which was also considered an equitable action. [...] The plaintiffs countered by comparing their suit to an action against an attorney for malpractice, which was an <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In Oneida II, {{the four}} dissenting justices would have applied laches {{to dismiss the}} claim.

[...] A footnote in the majority also quoted Ewert v.

60|$|The Senator was {{not very}} happy as to the Goarly business.

But now he was led to believe by what the landlord had said to him that he was being kept in the dark, and that there were facts generally known that he did not know. He had learned something of English manners and English institutions by his interference, but there might be a question whether he was not paying too dearly for his whistle. And there was growing upon him a feeling that before he had done he would have to blush for his colleagues.|$|E

Producing no effect by this coarse suggestion (which nobody who knows you could for a moment believe), Mr. Pedgift next referred to Miss Milroy, and asked Mr. Armadale if {{he had given up}} all idea of protecting her. What this meant I cannot imagine. I can only report it for your private consideration. Mr. Armadale briefly answered that he had his own plan for protecting Miss Milroy, and that the circumstances were altered in that quarter, or words to a similar effect. Still Mr. Pedgift persisted. He went on (I blush to mention) from bad to worse. He tried to persuade Mr. Armadale next to bring an <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>law</b> against one or other of the persons who had been most strongly condemning his conduct in the neighborhood, for the purpose--I really hardly know how to write it--of getting you into the witness-box. And worse yet: when Mr. Armadale still said No, Mr. Pedgift, after having, as I suspected by the sound of his voice, been on the point of leaving the room, artfully came back, and proposed sending for a detective officer from London, simply to look at you. 'The whole of this mystery about Miss Gwilt's true character,' he said, 'may turn on a question of identity. It won't cost much to have a man down from London; and it's worth trying whether her face is or is not known at headquarters to the police.' I again and again assure you, dearest lady, that I only repeat those abominable words from a sense of duty toward yourself. I shook--I declare I shook from head to foot when I heard them.|$|E

50|$|The Court {{prescribed}} its {{own rules}} for procedures to be followed. This was {{in contrast to the}} situation in the States, where civil procedure in <b>actions</b> <b>at</b> <b>law</b> (i.e., most lawsuits for monetary damages) in U.S. federal courts was normally provided for by state law, by virtue of the Conformity Act of 1872, until the promulgation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938.|$|R
5000|$|Procedure in {{the early}} federal courts was rather incoherent. The Process Act of 1792 {{authorized}} the federal courts to write their own procedural rules for everything but <b>actions</b> <b>at</b> <b>law.</b> In the context of <b>actions</b> <b>at</b> <b>law,</b> the Process Act of 1789 was so poorly written that it forced a federal court sitting in a state to apply the common law rules of pleading and procedure that were in effect in the state {{at the time it}} joined the Union, regardless of whether the state had modified or revised its civil procedure system since. [...] In other words, even though a state's common law pleading system was always constantly evolving through case law, the federal courts in that state were literally frozen in time. The Process Act did not speak to the problem of what law to apply in new states that joined the Union after the original Thirteen Colonies. In 1828, Congress enacted a law which stated that federal courts in new states would follow the civil procedure in effect at the time those states joined the Union.|$|R
