40|$|D {{graphics}} and animation {{have been used}} increasingly to provide on-line help and training of complex electro-mechanical devices. A good training system {{must be able to}} demonstrate clearly the correct dynamic sequences of using the device based on users' current state and <b>requested</b> <b>action.</b> The <b>system</b> must also be able to provide optimal viewing angles and lightings for users to view the dynamic sequences. This paper describes the design of a 3 D graphical manual system. The system uses a framebased knowledge structure to model the relationships and dependencies between the components of the device. The knowledge structure is sued to determine the sequences of animation to be performed in order to demonstrate a <b>requested</b> <b>action.</b> The <b>system</b> employs a viewing sphere technique to determine the best (dynamic) camera angles to view the progress of animation. It also adjusts the lighting condition dynamically to ensure that the main subject is adequately illuminated. A laser printer is modeled to demonstrate the feasibility of the system...|$|R

40|$|Background: There is a {{need for}} greater {{understanding}} of the epidemiology of primary care patient safety in order to generate solutions to prevent future harm. Aim: To estimate the rate of failures in processing <b>actions</b> <b>requested</b> in hospital discharge summaries and to determine factors associated with these failures. Design and setting: We undertook a retrospective records review. Our study population was emergency admissions for patients aged ≥ 75 years, drawn from ten practices in three areas of England. Method: One GP researcher reviewed the records for 300 patients after hospital discharge to determine the rate of compliance with <b>actions</b> <b>requested</b> in the discharge summary and to estimate the rate of associated harm from non-compliance. Where GPs documented decision making contrary to what was requested, these instances did not constitute failures. Data were also collected on time taken to process discharge communications. Results: There were failures in processing <b>actions</b> <b>requested</b> in 46...|$|R

40|$|To {{perform their}} duties, flight {{controllers}} for the Space Shuttle and International Space Station routinely need to locate specific operations documents and records from among {{tens of thousands}} available. Relevant information, {{in the form of}} team notes, console logs, <b>action</b> <b>requests,</b> anomaly reports, and flight procedures, is stored in heterogeneous databases and accessed using varying tools with differing interfaces. Users must consult these different systems and manually integrate results together to get a comprehensive view of relevant information. To improve access to flight control information, we have designed and built an application, XSearch, that integrates data from disparate flight operations databases. Through a common search interface, Mission Control personnel using XSearch can issue a single search query and simultaneously interrogate multiple mission operations data sources. The initial version of XSearch is planned for deployment in NASA’s Mission Control Center in mid- 2008, and will allow Shuttle and Station flight controllers to search simultaneously across three key mission operations data sources: the ChitS system (used to store mission <b>action</b> <b>requests)</b> ...|$|R
