25|$|When the {{cafeteria}} bombs failed to explode, Harris and Klebold convened <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the school. Both armed, they {{climbed to the}} top of the outdoor west entrance steps, placing them on a level with the athletic fields west of the building and the library inside the west entrance, directly above {{the cafeteria}}. From this vantage point, the cafeteria's west entrance was located at the bottom of the staircase, next to the senior parking lot.|$|E
25|$|Utilizing {{available}} forensic data, Robert Graysmith {{postulated that}} another car {{pulled into the}} turnout, just prior to 11:00pm and parked beside the couple. The killer apparently exited the second car <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the Rambler, possibly ordering the couple out of the Rambler. Jensen appeared to have exited the car first, yet when Faraday was halfway out, the killer apparently shot Faraday in the head. Fleeing from the killer, Jensen was gunned down twenty-eight feet from the car with five shots through her back. The killer then drove off.|$|E
2500|$|Around 10:50p.m., the Lennons' {{limousine}} {{returned to}} the Dakota. Lennon and Ono got out, passed Chapman <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the archway entrance of the building.

2500|$|After firing {{through the}} windows at {{evacuating}} students and the police, Klebold fired his shotgun at a nearby table, injuring three students: Patrick Ireland, Daniel Steepleton, and Makai Hall. He removed his trench coat. As Klebold fired at the three, Harris grabbed his shotgun <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the lower row of computer desks, firing a single shot under the first desk without looking. He hit 14-year-old Steven Curnow with a mortal wound to the neck. Harris then shot under the adjacent computer desk, injuring 17-year-old Kacey Ruegsegger with a shot which passed completely through her right shoulder and hand, also grazing her neck and severing a major artery. When she started gasping in pain, Harris tersely stated, [...] "Quit your bitching." ...|$|E
2500|$|They shot toward {{students}} standing {{close to}} a soccer field but did not hit anyone. They walked toward the west entrance, throwing pipe bombs, very few of which detonated. Meanwhile, inside the school, Patti Nielson, an art teacher, had noticed the commotion <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the west entrance with a 17-year-old student, Brian Anderson. She had intended to walk outside to tell the two students to [...] "Knock it off," [...] thinking Klebold and Harris were either filming a video or pulling a student prank. As Anderson opened {{the first set of}} double doors, Harris and Klebold shot out the windows, injuring him with flying glass and hitting Nielson in the shoulder with shrapnel. Nielson stood and ran back down the hall into the library, alerting the students inside to the danger and telling them to get under desks and keep silent. Nielson dialed 9-1-1 and hid under the library's administrative counter. Anderson remained behind, caught between the exterior and interior doors.|$|E
2500|$|On September 29, 1981, Texas Department of Public Safety Officer David Rucker {{was shot}} and killed along a stretch of highway a few miles north of Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley. Rucker's body, {{discovered}} by a passer-by, was lying beside his patrol car. He {{had been shot in the}} head. Around the same time, Los Fresnos Police Officer Enrique Carrisalez observed a speeding vehicle traveling on the same road away from where Rucker's body had been found. [...] Carrisalez and his partner turned on the patrol car's flashing red lights and pursued the vehicle, which pulled over. Carrisalez took a flashlight <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the car. The driver of the vehicle opened his door and exchanged words with Carrisalez before firing at least one shot at Carrisalez' chest. He died nine days later. Leonel Torres Herrera was arrested a few days later and was charged with the capital murder of both Carrisalez and Rucker.|$|E
