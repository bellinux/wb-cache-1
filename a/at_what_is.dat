It was created to spur settlement of the Red River Valley, protect steamboat traffic on the river, and protect wagon trains travelling to Montana.|$|E

5|$|Highway130 has {{retained}} {{most of its}} current route since the mid-1970s, but was longer prior to then, when it extended north of Arthur Street to Oliver Road and then along that road into downtown Thunder Bay, ending <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Water Street.

5|$|On September15, 1960, the Shook's Hill interchange, {{a unique}} rotary junction, was {{completed}} <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Erin Mills Parkway. It was opened to traffic the following day, and completed {{the program to}} make the QEW a freeway between Burlington and Toronto.|$|E

5|$|The Toba {{eruption}} (the Toba event) occurred <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Lake Toba about 75000±900 years ago. It was {{the last}} {{in a series of}} at least four caldera-forming eruptions at this location, with earlier calderas having formed around 788000±2200 years ago. This last eruption had an estimated VEI=8, making it the largest known explosive volcanic eruption within the last 25 million years.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally Padarn {{was said}} to come {{originally}} from Brittany, but he {{may have come from}} south-east Wales. He {{was said to}} be both abbot and bishop (the distinction was not so great then as it later became) for many years, and from his base <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now known as Llanbadarn Fawr (great or high church of St Padarn) he evangelised the neighbouring countryside.|$|E
5|$|While Highway141 was not {{designated}} {{until the}} mid-1970s, the route it follows was assumed in early 1956 by the Department of Highways.

5|$|Albany {{also has}} {{significant}} history with rail transport, as {{the location of}} two major regional railroad headquarters. The Delaware and Hudson Railway was headquartered in Albany <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now the SUNY System Administration Building. In 1853, Erastus Corning, a noted industrialist and Albany's mayor from 1834 to 1837, consolidated ten railroads stretching from Albany to Buffalo into the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR), headquartered in Albany until Cornelius Vanderbilt moved it to New York City in 1867. One of the ten companies that formed the NYCRR was the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, {{which was the first}} railroad in the state and the first successful steam railroad running regularly scheduled service in the country.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological finds, {{including}} flint tools {{believed to}} be between 300,000 and 126,000years old made with the Levallois technique, indicate the presence of Neanderthals in the Shirehampton and St Annes areas of Bristol during the Middle Palaeolithic. Iron Age hill forts near the city are at Leigh Woods and Clifton Down, {{on the side of}} the Avon Gorge, and on Kings Weston Hill near Henbury. A Roman settlement, Abona, existed <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Sea Mills (connected to Bath by a Roman road); another was at the present-day Inns Court. Isolated Roman villas and small forts and settlements were also scattered throughout the area.|$|E
5|$|Ashford's {{importance}} as an agricultural and market town {{grew in the}} 13th century, and in 1243, King Henry III granted the town a charter to hold a market for livestock. The pottery industry expanded in the 13th and 14th centuries, with the main works based <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Potter's Corner, a few {{miles west of the}} town centre. Later evidence from examining waste suggests that production was on a large scale. The Kent Archaeological society have discovered sandy ware at this location dating from around 1125 – 1250.|$|E

5|$|Beyond minor improvements, MD410 in Montgomery County has {{remained}} {{in much the}} same state since 1950. The only major change was the highway being split onto a one-way pair of streets in Bethesda in 1988. The Prince George's County section has seen more substantial changes over the intervening decades. The first major change in alignment occurred in 1956, when MD410 was completed on a new alignment as a four-lane divided highway between Ager Road just east of MD212 and MD500 <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Adelphi Road. The state highway was subsequently extended east over what was previously MD403, known as Colesville Road, to US1 in Riverdale.|$|E
5|$|By 1942 Jackson {{had held}} {{a job at}} the Sperry Corporation for several years and his work was {{considered}} essential to the war effort. With a brother serving overseas, he was not permitted to train for combat until June 1944, at which point he signed up for the Air Corps branch of the United States Army. He trained to be a bombardier <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Webb Air Force Base in Big Spring, Texas and graduated with the rank of second lieutenant. He served briefly as an instructor and then a combatant in the Pacific Theater of Operations until the surrender of Japan. He left the army in 1946 with the rank of First Lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|California {{has been}} {{inhabited}} by numerous Native American peoples since antiquity. The Spanish, the Russians, and other Europeans began exploring and colonizing {{the area in}} the 16th and 17th centuries, with the Spanish establishing its first California mission <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now San Diego in 1769. After the Mexican Cession of 1848, the California Gold Rush brought worldwide attention to the area. The growth of the movie industry in Los Angeles and Hollywood, high tech in Silicon Valley, tourism, agriculture, and other areas in the ensuing decades fueled the creation of a $1.85 trillion economy, the ninth-largest in the world.|$|E

They traveled in March from Cincinnati up the Great Miami River by pirogue and landed <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now St. Clair Street, where they found two small camps of Native Americans. Among the Thompson Party was Benjamin Van Cleve, whose memoirs provide insights into the Ohio Valley's history. Two other groups traveling overland arrived several days later.|$|E
5|$|During the Roman era {{there was}} a {{settlement}} named Abona at the present Sea Mills; this was important enough to feature in the 3rd-century Antonine Itinerary which documents towns and distances in the Roman empire, and was connected to Bath by a road. Archaeological excavations at Abona have found a street pattern, shops, cemeteries and wharves, indicating that the town served as a port. Another settlement <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Inns Court, Filwood, had possibly developed from earlier Iron Age farmsteads. There were also isolated villas and small settlements throughout the area, notably Kings Weston Roman Villa and another at Brislington.|$|E
5|$|Fort Vancouver, on {{the north}} bank of the Columbia River in what is today Vancouver, Washington, lay {{across the river from}} what would become Portland, Oregon. It was founded in 1825 by the Hudson's Bay Company chief factor for the area, Dr. John McLoughlin. The company sought furs and other trade goods, and was in {{competition}} with John Jacob Astor's Pacific Fur Company, which had an outpost <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Astoria, Oregon. Fort Vancouver was named for the British sea captain George Vancouver, who also gave his name to Vancouver in Canada.|$|E
