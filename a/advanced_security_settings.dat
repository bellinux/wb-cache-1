50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of {{vulnerabilities}} associated with WLANs: those caused by poor configuration and those caused by poor encryption.Poor configuration causes many vulnerabilities. Wireless networks are often put into use with no or insufficient <b>security</b> <b>settings.</b> With no <b>security</b> <b>settings</b> - the default configuration - access is obtained simply by association. Without sufficient <b>security</b> <b>settings,</b> networks can easily be defeated by cloaking and/or MAC address filtering.Poor encryption causes the remaining vulnerabilities. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is defective and can be defeated in several ways. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Cisco's Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) are vulnerable to dictionary attacks.|$|R

40|$|Managing cross-organisational <b>security</b> <b>settings</b> becomes {{increasingly}} important {{with the advent}} of cloud computing. While {{there has been a lot}} of literature on how to organise organisation-internal security management and how to efficiently audit it, little research has been done on the key roles involved in cross-organisational settings at the employee level as well as their responsibilities and interactions. Since considering these aspects is critical for successful management and efficient auditing of cross-organisational <b>security</b> <b>settings,</b> the primary goals of this paper are to investigate these aspects based on a qualitative empirical study with representatives of organisations assuming typical roles in cross-organisational <b>security</b> <b>settings.</b> This paper describes such a setting, the key employee roles involved and their interactions in detail, and discusses implications for managing cross-organisational <b>security</b> <b>settings</b> from the perspective of service providers who need to satisfy the potpourri of security and compliance requirements in such settings as well as from the perspective of auditors who need to efficiently attest compliance of the complex network of service-provider-consumer relationships with security requirements...|$|R

50|$|Windows Security Center, {{introduced}} in Windows XP Service Pack 2, provides users {{with the ability}} to view the status of computer <b>security</b> <b>settings</b> and services. Windows Security Center also continually monitors these <b>security</b> <b>settings,</b> and informs the user via a pop-up notification balloon if there is a problem. The Windows Security Center consists of three major components: A control panel, a Windows Service, and an application programming interface that is provided by Windows Management Instrumentation. The control panel divides the monitored <b>security</b> <b>settings</b> into categories, the headings of which are displayed with color-coded backgrounds. The current state of these settings is determined by the Windows service which starts automatically when the computer starts, and takes responsibility for continually monitoring the system for changes. The settings are made available to the system through a WMI provider. Anti-malware and firewall software vendors can register with the Security Center through the WMI provider. Windows Update settings and status are also monitored and reported.|$|R

Oracle TDE addresses encryption requirements associated with {{public and private}} privacy and security mandates such as PCI and California SB 1386. Oracle <b>Advanced</b> <b>Security</b> TDE column encryption was introduced in Oracle Database 10g Release 2. Oracle <b>Advanced</b> <b>Security</b> TDE tablespace encryption and support for Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) were introduced with Oracle Database 11gR1.

Future versions will likely standardize and enable automation for implementing and changing <b>security</b> <b>settings</b> of corresponding SP 800-53 controls. In this way, SCAP contributes to the implementation, assessment, and monitoring steps of the NIST Risk Management Framework. Accordingly, SCAP forms {{an integral part of}} the NIST FISMA implementation project.|$|R
