25|$|Many {{researchers}} {{think that}} their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with artificial general intelligence, combining all the skills mentioned above and even exceeding human ability in most or all these areas. A few believe that anthropomorphic features like artificial consciousness or an <b>artificial</b> <b>brain</b> may be required for such a project.|$|E
25|$|The <b>artificial</b> <b>brain</b> argument: The brain can be {{simulated}} by {{machines and}} because brains are intelligent, simulated brains {{must also be}} intelligent; thus machines can be intelligent. Hans Moravec, Ray Kurzweil and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software, and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original.|$|E

40|$|Summary. This chapter {{introduces}} {{the idea of}} “Evolvable Hardware, ” which applies evolutionary algorithms to the generation of programmable hardware {{as a means of}} achieving Artificial Intelligence. Cellular Automata-based Neural Networks are evolved in different modules, which form the components of <b>artificial</b> <b>brains.</b> Results from past models and plans for future work are presented. 1...|$|R
25|$|The law of {{accelerating}} returns is {{the basis}} for all of these speculations about creating a digital brain. It explains why computational capacity will continue to increase unabated even after Moore's Law expires, which Kurzweil predicts will happen around 2020. Integrated circuits, the current method of creating computer chips, will fade from the limelight, while some new more advanced technology will pick up the slack. It is this new technology that will get us to the massive levels of computation needed to create an <b>artificial</b> <b>brain.</b>|$|E

In her final moment as she [...] "dies" [...] in front of him, Yumemi ejects the memory card from her <b>artificial</b> <b>brain</b> for his safekeeping.

500|$|Henry's body is {{returned}} to his fiancée Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson) at his ancestral castle home. Minnie arrives to sound the alarm about the Monster, but her warning goes unheeded. Elizabeth, seeing Henry move, realizes he is still alive. Nursed back to health by Elizabeth, Henry has renounced his creation, but still believes he may be destined to unlock the secret of life and immortality. A hysterical Elizabeth cries that she sees death coming, foreshadowing the arrival of Henry's former mentor, Doctor Septimus Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger). In his rooms, Pretorius shows Henry several homunculi he has created, including a miniature queen, king, archbishop, devil, ballerina, and mermaid. Pretorius wishes to work with Henry to create a mate for the Monster and offers a toast to their venture: [...] "To a new world of gods and monsters!" [...] Upon forcing Henry to help him, Pretorius will grow an <b>artificial</b> <b>brain</b> while Henry gathers the parts for the mate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Neuromazes are pulsed neural {{networks}} synthesized in a 3 -dimensional cellular space. They {{are being developed}} for the <b>artificial</b> <b>brains</b> of future generation robots. In neuromazes there are two processing elements: dendrite-cells that return a pulse at clock t if one and only one pulse entered it at clock t- 1 and threshold-cells that return a pulse at clock t if its counter was 2 or more at clock t- 1. At every clock t the weighted sum of pulses that entered the threshold-cell at clock t- 1 {{is added to the}} discharged or not discharged counter. The weights can be – 1 or 0 or 1. Every cell receives pulses from k defined neighbors and sends pulses to up to 6 -k defined neighbors (k≤ 6). We present NeuroMazeTM 3. 0 Proa software tool for rapid prototyping of neuromaze-based modules for <b>artificial</b> <b>brains.</b> Some related designs are presented here...|$|R

2500|$|To {{build an}} <b>artificial</b> <b>brain</b> {{requires}} formulas, knowledge and sufficient computational power, explains Kurzweil. He says [...] "by {{around the year}} 2020" [...] a $1,000 personal computer will have enough speed and memory to match the human brain, based {{on the law of}} accelerating returns and his own estimates of the computational speed and memory capacity of the brain. Kurzweil predicts Moore's law will last until 2020 so current integrated circuits should come close to human brain levels of computation, but he says three dimensional chips will be the next big technology, followed potentially by optical computing, DNA computing, nanotubes, or quantum computing.|$|E
2500|$|Kurzweil {{feels the}} best model for an <b>artificial</b> <b>brain</b> {{is a real}} human brain, and {{suggests}} slicing up and digitizing preserved human brains or examining them non-invasively as technology permits. Kurzweil differentiates between scanning the brain to understand it, in a generic fashion, and scanning a particular person's brain {{in order to preserve}} it in exact detail, for [...] "uploading" [...] into a computer for example. The latter is much harder to do, he notes, because it requires capturing much more detail, but it will eventually happen as well. When it does [...] "we will be software, not hardware" [...] and our mortality will become a function of our ability to [...] "make frequent backups".|$|E

Several robot cities have been planned for the country: the first will be built in 2016 at a cost of 500 billion won (440 million USD), of which 50 billion is direct government investment. The new robot city will feature research and development centers for manufacturers and part suppliers, as well as exhibition halls and a stadium for robot competitions. The country's new Robotics Ethics Charter will establish ground rules and laws for human interaction with robots in the future, setting standards for robotics users and manufacturers, as well as guidelines on ethical standards to be programmed into robots to prevent human abuse of robots and vice versa.|$|E
