Eventually, you get <b>to</b> where <b>your</b> mind can read the feedback your muscles are providing, and your muscles can react <b>to</b> the stimulus <b>your</b> mind is providing. Practice posing between sets or anytime. And feel your muscles working throughout your sets. Eventually, your mind and muscles will speak the same language and communicate back and forth." ...|$|R

You have not decided [...] what amount of additional time or <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> give <b>to</b> <b>your</b> [...] studies, or, when you will begin, or when you will end. There is no [...] one time when you will feel that you are breaking your resolution, [...] because there were no particular times when you were to study more. [...] You waste one opportunity and another, and then, with a feeling of [...] discouragement, and self-reproach, conclude <b>to</b> abandon <b>your</b> [...] resolution.

You and your friends have all seen it and have come away with different views. One friend says he felt that one of the leads was not convincing in the role; you disagree—you think the failing was in the screenplay, and want <b>to</b> make <b>your</b> case. But before you have a chance to get going, another friend jumps in and says she doesn’t think this actor was miscast, just that he’s not very good, and is prepared to argue chapter and verse. You think your point is a good one, and you want to make it; but you’ll only offend this friend, who’s now arguing her point with enthusiasm. Moreover, you find yourself agreeing with some of what she’s saying. <b>Your</b> challenge is <b>to</b> manage two tasks at once: pay <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> what <b>your</b> friend is saying, both out of courtesy and to follow her argument so you don’t repeat or overlook her points when you speak; and hold on <b>to</b> <b>your</b> own argument, that is forming in your head as you listen.

It contained more detailed data of utmost interest to historians and disclosed hitherto unknown circumstances concerning the outbreak of the 1857 uprising. According to Raja Rao it was not only planned beforehand, but was connected with hopes for the movement of Russian troops in Central Asia. The document opened a hitherto unknown page in the history of mutual relations between the two nations.|$|R
