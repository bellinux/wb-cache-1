5000|$|The neutron {{precession}} in an {{induction field}} is rather small. Thus {{in the case}} of thin films (~1 µm thick) the neutron interaction is rather small. Thus in order to obtain a measurable signal, it has been proposed that a grazing incidence geometry could be used. In such a geometry, the interaction is enhance since the neutron travels a longer path inside the induction field. Such measurements however assume that the planar structure of the systemis homogeneous and that the induction varie only through the depth of the magnetic film.

5000|$|It {{measures}} {{the change in}} anisotropic magnetoresistance caused by an external magnetic field in the Hall geometry. The sensor responds to magnetic field components in the sensor plane {{as opposed to the}} ordinary Hall sensor, which measures field components perpendicular to the sensor plane. Hence the name [...] "planar Hall". Generally speaking, for ferromagnetic materials, the resistance is larger when the current flows along the direction of magnetization than when it flows perpendicular to the magnetization vector. This creates an asymmetric electric field perpendicular to the current, which depends on the magnetization state of the sensor. Exactly controlling the magnetization state {{is the key to the}} operation of the planar Hall sensor. From fabrication the magnetization is confined to one certain direction in zero applied field, and the application of a field perpendicular to this direction changes the magnetization state in such a way that the electronic readout is linear with respect to the magnitude of the applied field. This is true for applied fields smaller than a fourth of the intrinsic effective <b>anisotropy</b> <b>field</b> (see ref. 1 for details on the working principle).|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of magnetic materials for recording media applications increased {{the demands for}} new and more precise experimental investigation techniques. In respect with these demands, this project is focused on experimental analyses of advanced particulate media and magnetic thin film samples. A new extended rotational remanence technique for <b>anisotropy</b> <b>field</b> measurements was developed. The technique is suitable for samples that contain aligned or partially aligned particles and provides both: in-plane <b>anisotropy</b> <b>field</b> distributions and the in-plane <b>anisotropy</b> <b>field.</b> This technique was also extended to out-of-plane <b>anisotropy</b> <b>field</b> measurements. Rotational hysteresis was introduced as an alternative method for <b>anisotropy</b> <b>field</b> measurements. This applies well {{in the case of}} samples without texture or samples having very small magnetic moment (i. e. thin films). The two techniques for <b>anisotropy</b> <b>field</b> measurement compare well and the experimental results were interpreted in terms of inter-particles interactions. Two measurement methods for determination of the demagnetizing field acting perpendicular to a sample plane were also developed. The first method is based on the in-plane and out-of-plane <b>anisotropy</b> <b>field</b> determination using an extended rotational remanence technique. The second method can provide the demagnetizing field starting from in-plane and out-of-plane transverse hysteresis loops. Comparison between the results from the two methods showed good agreement. Furthermore, the demagnetizing field values were used to calculate the magnetic coating thickness, so the two methods provide a non-destructive method for magnetic thickness measurements in film samples. The in-plane easy axis distribution (EAD) was experimentally determined using vector VSM techniques. Correlations between in-plane tape texture and magnetic thickness were obtained for a series of advanced MP tapes. A theoretical approach was used in order to relate the orientation ratio to EAD. The out-of-plane EAD was derived from numerical calculations. The out-of-plane distribution also showed a variation with the magnetic thickness. In addition, the microstructure and particle morphology of the advanced MP tapes, as well as the out-of-plane component of magnetization, have been investigated using Moessbauer Spectroscopy. Finally, 3 D - EAD maps were produced. All VSM experiments were fully computer controlled and the routines were designed in the LabView environment as part of this project.

40|$|Abstract. A {{practical}} way to manipulate the magnetic anisotropy of magnetostrictive FeGa thin films grown on flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates is introduced in this study. The effect of film thickness on magnetic properties and magnetostriction constant of polycrystalline FeGa thin films was investigated. The <b>anisotropy</b> <b>field</b> Hk of flexible FeGa films, i. e., the saturation field determined by fitting the hysteresis curves measured along the hard axis, was enhanced with increasing the tensile strain applied along the easy axis of the thin films, but this enhancement via strain became unconspicuous with increasing the thickness of FeGa films. In order to study the magnetic sensitivity of thin films responding to the external stress, we applied different strains on these films and measure the corresponding <b>anisotropy</b> <b>field.</b> Moreover, the effective magnetostriction constant of FeGa films was calculated from the changes of both <b>anisotropy</b> <b>field</b> and external strain based on the Villari effect. A Neel’s phenomenological model was developed to illustrate that the effective <b>anisotropy</b> <b>field</b> of FeGa thin films was contributed from both the constant volume term and the inverse thickness dependent surface term. Therefore, the magnetic properties for the volume and surface of FeGa thin films were different, which has been verified in this work by using vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) system. The <b>anisotropy</b> <b>field</b> contributed by the surface of FeGa film and obtained by MOKE is smaller than that contributed by the film volume and measured by VSM.
