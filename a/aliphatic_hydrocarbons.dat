Both the methylene unsymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibrations peaking at 3040 and 2920  cm− 1 relative intensity declined {{with the increase}} in oxidation temperature, which showed that the <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> had the least difficulty in reacting with the absorbed oxygen. Since the oxidation temperature increased, the reaction of the side chains of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> with oxygen was difficult, resulting in unstable <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> absorbance and producing carbonyl groups. The presence of a significant amount of active oxygen-containing functional groups led to increasing tendency of coal to further oxidation. Also, the higher level of the oxidation temperature is, the easier the re-oxidation occurs (Liang et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|While {{it is well}} {{recognized}} that interstellar grains are made of amorphous silicates and some form of carbonaceous materials, it remains debated regarding what exact chemical and physical form the carbonaceous component takes. Contemporary grain models assume that the silicate and carbon components are either physically separated, or they form a core-mantle structure, or they agglomerate to form porous composites. The core-mantle model posits that the mantle is made {{of some sort of}} <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> materials and is responsible for the 3. 4 micrometer absorption feature ubiquitously seen in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way and external galaxies. This model is challenged by the nondetection of polarization in the 3. 4 micrometer absorption feature as the 9. 7 micrometer silicate feature is observed to be polarized. To alleviate this challenge, we calculate the degree of polarization of the 3. 4 micrometer feature for spheroidal silicate dust coated by a layer of spherical <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon.</b> It is found that the 3. 4 micrometer feature polarization still exceeds the observational upper limit, even though spherical <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> mantles are expected to cause much less polarization than nonspherical (e. g., spheroidal) mantles. We have also shown that the composite grain model which consists of amorphous silicate, <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> and vacuum also predicts the 3. 4 micrometer feature polarization to well exceed what is observed. These results support the earlier arguments that the <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> component is physically separated from the silicate component unless the 3. 4 micrometer absorption feature is just a minor carbon sink in the ISM.

25|$|Steam {{cracking}} is {{the process}} for producing ethylene and other alkenes from <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Depending on the feedstock used to produce the olefins, steam cracking can produce a benzene-rich liquid by-product called pyrolysis gasoline. Pyrolysis gasoline can be blended with other hydrocarbons as a gasoline additive, or routed through an extraction process to recover BTX aromatics (benzene, toluene and xylenes).|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} other stipulations that exist. Yasuda et al. studied 28 {{monomers}} {{and found that}} those containing aromatic groups, silicon, olefinic group or nitrogen (NH, NH2, CN) were readily polymerizable, while those containing oxygen, halides, <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and cyclic hydrocarbons where decomposed more readily.

40|$|Several {{thermoanalytical}} {{methods were}} used to assess the compatibility of EBA (copolymer of ethylene and n-butyl acrylate) hot melts containing tackifiers of different nature (pentaerythritol rosin ester, polyterpene resin, <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> resin, aromatic hydrocarbon resin, and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon resin). The influence of the compatibility of EBA hot melts on their rheological, viscoelastic, and adhesion properties to polar (aluminum foil) and nonpolar (polypropylene film) substrates were analyzed. The viscosity and shear thinning at 160 °C of EBA hot melts varied significantly by changing the tackifier nature; however, at 180 °C all EBA hot melts showed similar viscosities and shear thinning was absent because of the rupture of physical interactions between their components. EBA copolymer showed broad tackifier compatibility, even though <b>aliphatic</b> and aromatic <b>hydrocarbon</b> resins were less compatible. Compatibility was assessed by softening point and cloud point measurement, and dynamical mechanical thermal analysis. The most compatible EBA hot melts were obtained with rosin ester, polyterpene and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon tackifiers and they showed the highest tack and adhesion. On the contrary, the less-compatible EBA hot melts were obtained with aromatic and <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> tackifiers, and they showed the lowest adhesion. EBA containing <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> tackifier was exceptional because of even being incompatible, it showed high tack.

25|$|In the United States, western Europe, and Japan, {{butadiene}} {{is produced}} as {{a byproduct of}} the steam cracking process used to produce ethylene and other olefins. When mixed with steam and briefly heated to very high temperatures (often over 900°C), <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> give up hydrogen to produce a complex mixture of unsaturated hydrocarbons, including butadiene. The quantity of butadiene produced depends on the hydrocarbons used as feed.

25|$|In {{catalytic}} reforming, {{a mixture}} of hydrocarbons with boiling points between 60–200°C is blended with hydrogen gas and then exposed to a bifunctional platinum chloride or rhenium chloride catalyst at 500–525°C and pressures ranging from 8–50 atm. Under these conditions, <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> form rings and lose hydrogen to become aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic products of the reaction are then separated from the reaction mixture (or reformate) by extraction with any {{one of a number}} of solvents, including diethylene glycol or sulfolane, and benzene is then separated from the other aromatics by distillation. The extraction step of aromatics from the reformate is designed to produce aromatics with lowest non-aromatic components. Recovery of the aromatics, commonly referred to as BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene isomers), involves such extraction and distillation steps.

Soils were amended with 10 or 100 mg kg(- 1) of a model alkane n-hexadeccane and 100 Bq g(- 1) C- 14 -n-hexadecane. correlations between the extents of mineralisation and extraction of the C- 14 -contaminant were determined. Solvent shake extractions and aqueous CaCl 2 extractions were poor predictors of hexadecane bioaccessibility. However, the novel HP-alpha-CD shake extraction showed close correlation (r(2) = 0. 90, n= 36, p< 0. 05) to the mineralisation data.
