5|$|The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a {{vertical}} seeking gyroscope. Its function {{was to establish}} and maintain a stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane. With the horizontal plane established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between the deck and the horizontal plane. These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper so that it could keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. (see picture) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire. The center key (with bumps on its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic Firing Key. When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship's deck was parallel the horizontal plane. Also, if the sea state was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship's motion, the guns could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described. The right key was the Hand Firing Key. It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired the guns directly.|$|E

Swift said, [...] "I'd always {{go in there and}} play him some new songs, and the next week he would have this awesome track, on which he played every instrument, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> like a record.

500|$|Although vocals {{would usually}} take many {{alternate}} takes to complete, Hoppus completed {{much of the}} vocal track for [...] "Adam's Song" [...] in a single take. [...] "It's in a pretty high register for me, so I just blasted it out one night after dinner. That's, like, 90 per cent of what's on the final track," [...] he told Kerrang!. The idea to include piano in the track came without much forethought; [...] "We realized, 'Well, this part here could sound rad if we put piano in here.' So we tried it out, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> rad," [...] said Hoppus. The piano was performed by session musician Roger Joseph Manning, Jr., {{best known for his}} work with Beck.|$|E

500|$|... "The Wave" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Miike Snow's three members: Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg and Andrew Wyatt. The song was recorded alongside {{the rest of}} their second studio album Happy to You (2012) {{during the second half of}} 2011. The band had more [...] "creative freedom" [...] while making the album, compared to their 2009 self-titled debut album. They felt they could [...] "plan the process more", which included inviting the Swedish Army drum corps to play military drums on several tracks, such as [...] "The Wave". Karlsson told Billboard that his favorite part of the song occurs during the second verse, in which all band members are hitting the drums simultaneously. [...] "We hit anything we could hit at the same time ... <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> kind of cool", he said. Nils Törnqvist is credited for playing the drums, while David Lindberg, Jonathan Lundberg and Claes Malmberg played the military drums. Swedish musician Gustav Ejstes of band Dungen played the autoharp, and the band provided additional instruments, arrangement and programming. Niklas Flyckt mixed the track at Robotberget, Miike Snow's own studio in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E
500|$|... "Yellow" [...] {{was written}} in [...] Rockfield studio in Wales called the Quadrangle, where Coldplay began working on their debut album, Parachutes. One night after {{finishing}} recording [...] "Shiver", the band took a break and {{went out of the}} studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and [...] "just amazing", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song's main melody, consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously [...] "as he relayed the tune {{to the rest of the}} band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice". Martin has said, [...] "The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice." [...] The melody [...] "started off a lot slower", according to drummer Will Champion, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> like a Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse. When guitarist Jonny Buckland started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas, they had created the riff, [...] "and it sort of got a bit heavier".|$|E

2500|$|In October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon {{attended}} a Double Trouble performance at Rockefeller's in Houston. Shannon, who {{was playing with}} Alan Haynes at the time, participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented: [...] "I went down there that night, and I'll never forget this: it was like, when I {{walked in the door}} and I heard them playing, it was like a revelation—'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.' During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E
