40|$|Background. Inactivity during {{hospitalization}} {{in older}} medical patients {{may lead to}} functional decline. This study quantified 24 -hour mobility, validated the accelerometers used, and assessed the daily level of basic mobility in acutely admitted older medical patients during their hospitalization. Methods. This is a prospective cohort study in older medical patients able to walk independently (<b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients)</b> and those not able to walk independently (nonambulatory patients) on admission. The 24 -hour mobility level during hos-pitalization was assessed by measuring the time in lying, sitting, and standing and/or walking, by two accelerometers. Basic mobility was quantified within 48 hours of admission and repeated daily throughout hospitalization. Results. Forty-three <b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients</b> and six nonambulatory patients were included. The <b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients</b> tended to be hospitalized for fewer days than the nonambulatory patients (7 vs 16, p =. 13). The <b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients</b> were lying median 17 hours, (interquartile range [IQR]: 14. 4 – 19. 1), sitting 5. 1 hours (IQR: 2. 9 – 7. 1), and standing and/or walk...|$|R

At {{the time of the}} questionnaire, 20. 4 % of admitted patients, 39. 1 % of <b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients,</b> and 30. 7 % of healthy subjects were using dietary supplements, which including vitamin/mineral supplements, herbal extracts, its ingredients, or food for specified health uses. The primary purpose for use in all groups was health maintenance, whereas 3. 7 % of healthy subjects, 10. 0 % of <b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients,</b> and 13. 2 % of admitted patients used dietary supplements to treat diseases. In addition, 17. 7 % of admitted patients and 36. 8 % of <b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients</b> were using dietary supplements concomitantly with their medications. However, among both admitted <b>patients</b> and <b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients,</b> almost 70 % did not mention dietary supplement use to their physicians.

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{frequency}} and causes of abnormal thyrotropin (TSH) levels in <b>ambulatory</b> and hospitalized <b>patients</b> and to assess the specificity and sensitivity of suppressed TSH for the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in these two settings, analysis of thyroid function tests including sensitive TSH measurement was performed on 715 consecutive patients who had a thyroid panel performed in one clinical laboratory. Suppressed TSH (less than 0. 3 mU/L) and elevated TSH (greater than 5. 5 mU/L) were found in 35 (8. 5 %) and 28 (6. 5 %) of the 411 regular ward inpatients. The prevalence of suppressed TSH {{was significantly higher than}} that of high TSH among the 267 <b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients</b> (11. 6 % vs 5. 6 %, p less than 0. 03). A total of 37 severely ill ICU patients had a significantly higher prevalence of both suppressed and elevated TSH (16 % and 22 % respectively) than regular ward inpatients and <b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients.</b> Hyperthyroidism and exogenous thyroid hormone administration were responsible for suppressed TSH in 65 % of <b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients</b> and in 34 % of regular ward and ICU patients. In contrast nonthyroidal illness was implicated in 36 % of hospitalized patients and in 6 % of <b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients.</b> The sensitivity and specificity of suppressed TSH for the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism was 90 % and 91 % for <b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients</b> and 100 % and 91 % for hospitalized patients respectively. The predictive value of suppressed TSH for hyperthyroidism was higher in outpatients (26 %) than in hospitalized patients (7 %). After patients with known causes for suppressed TSH other than thyroid disease had been excluded, the corrected predictive values of suppressed TSH for hyperthyroidism were 57 % in outpatients and 21 % in hospitalized patients.

METHOD : A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 16 Belgian hospitals selected from a sample of 67 hospitals. The hospitals were equally distributed between the north and south part of the country and were representative of Belgian practice. During 2 months, participating psychiatrists were asked to record the medication use as well as demographic parameters of all consecutive <b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients</b> seen at their consultation or attending a day-hospital. Data concerning 1000 <b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients</b> with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were collected. RESULTS : In Belgium, the use of atypical antipsychotics is frequent (69 %) in <b>ambulatory</b> <b>patients</b> with schizophrenia. In the overall sample, 73 % receive only one antipsychotic drug. The majority of patients are treated with drugs of only one antipsychotic drug group, either first- typical (29. 8 %) or second-generation, atypical antipsychotics (53. 2 %). 15. 8 % of patients combine different types of antipsychotics. Antipsychotic dosing is adequate for the majority of patients but about one fifth receives a higher than recommended dose as per package inserts. Polypharmacy remains within reasonable limits. The use of concomitant medication varies according the antipsychotic treatment: patients who take second-generation antipsychotics only, receive the least additional drugs.
