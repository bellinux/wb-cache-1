2500|$|The railway {{uses the}} Radio Control Train Order {{signalling}} system. Outside Ravenglass station, {{the line is}} single track with passing loops at Miteside, Irton Road and Fisherground. Trains operate by radio communication between drivers and at Ravenglass signal box. At passing loops and the terminus station, drivers contact the controller, using [...] "RANDER" [...] reporting numbers (even numbers for up trains, and odd for down), {{to indicate that the}} train is within the loop and is clear of the preceding single track. To leave the loop, the driver contacts control to gain <b>authorisation</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> the next single track section. No semaphore signals are used outside Ravenglass station. Points at passing loops are weighted with direction indicators, meaning that no human intervention is required and the points reset themselves automatically after the passage of a train when entering the points from a trailing direction when the points are set for the other rail line.|$|E
5000|$|An {{overflight}} permit is an <b>authorisation</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> {{the sovereign}} airspace (12 nm limit) {{of a given}} country, overfly, and exit it.

40|$|Irregular {{migrants}} and {{asylum seekers}} {{have died and}} continue to die attempting to cross the external borders of the EU without <b>authorisation,</b> seeking <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> the territories of its Member States. Yet, remarkably {{little is known about}} these ‘border deaths’. In 2015, the Human Costs of Border Control project published the Deaths at the Borders Database for the Southern EU, an open-source ‘evidence base’ of individualised information about people who have died border deaths between 1990 and 2013, sourced from the death management systems of Spain, Gibraltar, Italy, Malta and Greece. It is the first database on border deaths in the EU to be based on official sources as opposed to the news media. The project involved searching 563 state-run death registry archives and deductively selecting the death certificates of persons who died border deaths. This paper describes, in detail, the making of the Deaths at the Borders Database: from the systematic, multi-sited, quantitative data collection and qualitative case studies, to the construction and final results of the Database itself...|$|R

50|$|Moorgate Halt {{railway station}} was opened on 1 January 1912 on the London and North Western Railway route from Stalybridge to Huddersfield.

5000|$|Later still, in 1672, it {{engaged the}} {{attention}} of the bishops of Ireland, who deputed Dr. John O'Mollony, Roman Catholic Bishop of Killaloe, to treat with Colbert as to the establishment of a new college. What the bishops desired was eventually obtained, through the influence of two Irish priests resident in Paris: Dr. Patrick Maginn, formerly first chaplain to Queen Catherine, wife of Charles II of England, and Dr. Malachy Kelly, one of the chaplains of Louis XIV. These two ecclesiastics obtained from Louis XIV <b>authorisation</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> on possession of the Collège des Lombards, a college of the University of Paris founded for Italian students in 1333. They rebuilt the college, then in ruins, at their own expense, and became its first superiors. The acquisition of the college was confirmed by letters patent dated 1677 and 1681. Some years later the buildings were extended by Dr. John Farely, and all the Irish ecclesiastical students in Paris found a home in the Collège des Lombards.|$|E
40|$|Congolese, Burundese and Rwandese {{refugees}} in Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) {{are confronted with}} an illegal status even as refugees of these countries are recognized by the Tanzanian government as prima facie refugees (1969 OAU protocol) because the 1998 Tanzanian refugee policy prescribes that all refugees reside in camps in rural, Western Tanzania. This policy contravenes international laws stipulating that persons having received the <b>authorisation</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> a country, enjoy a freedom of movement within its national borders. The implication of the Tanzanian refugee policy (similar to that of many other countries worldwide) is that urban refugees—while recognized as refugees—are forced to a clandestine life in Dar es Salaam and, for lack of legal documents, run the permanent risk of refoulement. The practical implications for doing research among this type of populations are the difficulties in locating and meeting people, gaining their trust and guaranteeing the confidentiality of their information.

40|$|The bill, {{despite some}} innovations, {{preserves}} {{a good deal}} of continuity with the provisions of the 1991 immigration law, and also for that matter with immigration practices prior to 1991. In particular, it maintains two fundamental approaches: § the need for two separately awarded but interdependent documents for residence and work of non-EU nationals § absurdly onerous obligations on potential employers of immigrants for <b>authorisation</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> Greece Hand in hand with these two approaches comes the state bureaucracy, with unwieldy and inefficient structures and generally an incapacity to fulfil its obligations adequately. In the award of residence permits, for example, although the predominant role of the Ministry of Public Order has been removed, and apparently ‘modernised’, it has in fact been replaced by a complex structure involving the new Immigration Committees, prefectures, the police, OAED, the Interior Ministry and the “Foreigner and Immigration Service”. Furthermore, it would seem that every applicant for issue or renewal of a residence permit is required to appear in person before an Immigration Committee; the resultant overwhelming of the system and long delays are simply inevitable...|$|E
