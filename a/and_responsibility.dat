40|$|Abstract]: In Australia, {{changes in}} social {{attitude}} to conservation {{and the environment}} over the past sixty years has demanded changes to property rights, restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> In Queensland, as in most jurisdictions in Australia, {{there has been an}} increase in controls and a gradual and progressive unbundling of traditionally held property rights as a response by governments to this social change. This project investigated the property rights, restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of land owners in Queensland with property which adjoins the littoral zone. This gave an insight into the number and type of property rights, restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> which are unique to property with a littoral boundary. The study also examined how these property rights, restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> were spatially defined and how they were recorded for land administration. Field surveys were carried out at three sites to examine the spatial extent of rights, restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> in a real world environment. Results showed that while private property rights, restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> were recorded under the current titling system, most publicly created rights, restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> were not. The study also revealed problems with how rights, restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> are defined spatially in legislation which lead to ambiguity in defining these rights, restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> in the real world. Finally it was found that where information was available in relation to the spatial extent of rights, restrictions <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> it was often inaccurate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} {{aimed to}} investigate the extent of children’s, teachers’ and parents’ knowledge of children’s rights <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> {{the extent to which}} children were being responsible with their rights. The results were used to design a programme for teaching children’s rights <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> in schools. A sequential explanatory mixed method approach was used. Phase 1 gathered quantitative data from 577 Grade 9 learners, 109 teachers and 402 parents using a questionnaire. The data was analysed using SPSS 22. 0 software for descriptive statistics and factor analysis. Phase 2 collected qualitative data through individual interviews with six learners, five teachers and six parents and five focus groups. Quantitative results showed learners, teachers and parents were able to identify their rights <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> from the given items to a large extent while qualitative results revealed a lower knowledge base of rights <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> among learners as compared to teachers and parents. Quantitative results showed that learners were being responsible for their rights to a large extent while qualitative results indicated that learners generally lacked responsibility for their rights. Both quantitative and qualitative findings indicated a lack of teaching of children’s rights <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> at school, home and community places and the need to educate learners and their significant adults more on children’s rights <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> Phase 3 integrated both phases and then the development of a programme for teaching learners about rights <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> to include more practical teaching methods to allow learners to be actively involved in the learning process. The study contributed in understanding the gap in knowledge of rights <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> among children <b>and</b> their significant adults. It is hoped that {{the results of the study}} will help the learners to know and understand more of their rights <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> as well as appropriately putting them into practice.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and interpret}} adolescents´ lived experiences of their rights, duties <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> {{in relation to}} their health choices. Fourteen focus group interviews with 67 adolescents aged 15 and 16 were conducted and analysed using the phenomenological hermeneutical method. Adolescents´ lived experiences of their rights {{in relation to their}} health choices were described as things that were allowed. Duties <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> were perceived as something that they were required to carry out for their own health or other people´s health. Although their experiences of rights, duties <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> overlapped, they referred to different aspects of their health choices. Adolescents viewed their rights, duties <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> in the wider context, with parents and society defining their opportunities to make independent choices. We found that ethical considerations influenced adolescents´ choices and, the opportunities to exercise their rights, duties <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> varied.

The study was completed through qualitative study approach; the data was gathered through semi-structured interviews, observations and document analysis to ensure the validity of the data. Thematic analysis approach was used to understand the data. Two DDOs, one EDO and three Head Teachers participated in the study as primary and secondary respondents. To highlight DDOs 2 ̆ 7 roles <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> as education leaders, the study focused on exploring the key research question, 2 ̆ 2 How do DDOs perceive and practice their roles <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> as Educational Leaders in the context of Balochistan in Pakistan? 2 ̆ 2 The subsidiary questions included: i) What value do DDOs give to their roles <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> as Educational Leaders? ii) How do they enact their roles <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities?</b> iii) What opportunities and challenges do they face in fulfilling their roles <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities?</b> The study identified the roles <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of DDOs as educational leaders. It was found that DDOs perceived their role as supervisors instead of an educational leader. The findings of the study also showed that DDOs have opportunities of supporting staff, and in-service trainings. In addition to that, there are many challenges that DDOs face, like law and order situation, lack of human and material resources and political pressure. These factors hinder their role <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> as educational leaders.
