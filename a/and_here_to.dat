The {{oldest of the}} Watkins children, Sean was only twelve {{years old at the}} time. At the start of Nickel Creek's history, Chris Thile played guitar and Sean Watkins played mandolin but later they decided to switch instruments. The band played many bluegrass festivals throughout the 1990s, and the band members were home-schooled to accommodate their tour schedule.

500|$|The University of California at Berkeley {{commissioned}} American neoclassical composer Roger Sessions (1896–1985) to set {{the poem}} as a cantata to commemorate their centennial anniversary in 1964. Sessions did not finish composing the work until the 1970s, dedicating it to the memories of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. and political figure Robert F. Kennedy, both assassinated in 1968. Sessions first became acquainted with Leaves of Grass in 1921 and began setting the poem {{as a reaction to}} the death of his friend, George Bartlett, although none of the sketches from that early attempt survive. [...] He returned to the text almost fifty years later, composing a work scored for soprano, contralto, and baritone soloists, mixed chorus and orchestra. The music is described as responding [...] "wonderfully both to the Biblical majesty and musical fluidity of Whitman's poetry, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>to,</b> in the evocation of the gray-brown bird singing from the swamp and of the over-mastering scent of the lilacs, he gives us one of the century's great love letters to Nature." ...|$|E

At Antalo, Napier parleyed with Ras Kassai (later Emperor Yohannes IV), and won his support, which the British needed in their single-minded march to Magdala; without the help, or at least indifference, of the local peoples, the British Expedition would have had greater difficulty in reaching its goal deep within the Ethiopian highlands.
