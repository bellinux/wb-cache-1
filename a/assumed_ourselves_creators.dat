Integral education is introduced {{as a catalyst for}} transformation, moving our emphasis in education from gathering knowledge to growing consciousness. Expanding awareness provides a paradigm shift from epistemology to ontology, which would fundamentally alter where our attention is focused, from having and doing to being—providing an opening to directly experience <b>ourselves</b> as the <b>creators</b> of our reality...|$|R
40|$|We as architects {{consider}} <b>ourselves</b> <b>creators.</b> We {{work under}} the false assumption that buildings will last forever. However, {{the fact is that}} every building eventually dies. This thesis rethinks the question of death. The Salt House Project is a product of this questioning. It tests radically rapid turnover of the building life cycle in the Islands of Galapagos, Ecuador. The thesis is carried out by designing a salt-cured seasonal residence, which will gradually and naturally be demolished over a designated period of time. The building life expectancy will be precisely set out from the beginning to the end-purporting each and every step of its life cycle -from occupation to demolition. It will be constructed and disappear back into the nature within a one-year life cycle. Some parts will obviously remain {{for a longer period of}} time depending on its structural integrity. However, the big picture is that the house will evolve-decay over time, varying not only in its form but also in its function. To implement this idea, all building materials will be based on natural resources including salt, soil, gravel, sand and coconut fiber. Water and heat will be the binding solution of the building structure and wind and rain will act as demolition agents. This thesis challenges the attempt to alleviate building obsolescence over time by reversely mandating a building's life expectancy. In doing so, we achieve firstly, a sympathetic connection between geometry and material and secondly, a vitality to achieve eccentric expressions of life styles that can be highly unique and customized. In fact, the way we operate shifts dramatically when we design for death as opposed to perpetuity. by SunMin May Hwang. Thesis: M.

6000|$|Strange it is, {{that men}} should admit the {{validity}} of the arguments for free discussion, but object to their being [...] "pushed to an extreme;" [...] not seeing that unless the reasons are good for an extreme case, they are not good for any case. Strange that they should imagine that they are not assuming infallibility, when they acknowledge that there should be free discussion on all subjects which can possibly be doubtful, but think that some particular principle or doctrine should be forbidden to be questioned because it is so certain, that is, because they are certain that it is certain. To call any proposition certain, while there is any one who would deny its certainty if permitted, but who is not permitted, is to <b>assume</b> that we <b>ourselves,</b> and those who agree with us, are the judges of certainty, and judges without hearing the other side.|$|R
40|$|In {{the general}} debate {{prior to the}} onset of war in Iraq, we made public our view, {{in a letter to}} the Guardian newspaper, that the war could be {{justified}} neither by reference to earlier UN Security Council resolutions nor by way of the doctrine of self-defence. In this article we reflect on some of the anxieties we experienced both before and after that ‘intervention’ in terms of the vision of international law we might unwillingly promote, and in terms of the role we appeared to <b>assume</b> for <b>ourselves,</b> and our professional colleagues, in public debate. Despite our efforts to prevent legal issues from dominating, we came to be viewed as the defenders of an anti-hegemonic legality – resisting the erosion by an opportunistic coalition of the principles of sovereignty, non-intervention, and collective security. We were concerned that this made us appear champions of international law in a way with which none of us was entirely comfortable. On the other hand, in contesting that, we seemed in danger of valorising a politics of expertise that gave international lawyers a privileged position within the debate. We reflect, then, on the consequences, intentional or otherwise, of our intervention, and explore the dilemmas associated with it. The problem with which we finally grapple is whether the relationship between critical scholarship and the techniques associated with it (anti-formalism, complexity, and indeterminacy) is such as to preclude strategic intervention in the effort to stop a war...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that calculating if something is to someone’s left or right involves a simulative process recruiting representations of our own body in imagining ourselves in the position of the other person (Kessler & Rutherford, 2010). We compared left and right judgements from another’s spatial position (spatial perspective judgements) to judgements of how a numeral appeared from another’s point of view (visual perspective judgements). Experiment 1 confirmed that these visual and spatial perspective judgements involved a process of rotation as they became more difficult with angular disparity between the self and other. There was evidence of some difference between the two, but both showed a linear pattern. Experiment 2 went a step further in showing that these judgements used embodied self rotations, as their difficulty was also dependent on the current position of the self within the world. This effect was significantly stronger in spatial perspective-taking, but was present in both cases. We conclude that embodied self-rotations, through which we actively imagine <b>ourselves</b> <b>assuming</b> someone else’s position in the world can subserve not only reasoning about where objects are in relation to someone else but also how the objects in their environment appear to them...|$|R
40|$|How {{often do}} we notice the {{buildings}} {{that we work}} in, play in and live in? The architecture that we construct is specially geared to our human proportions, and shelters and accommodates us. It {{can be seen as}} a metaphor for the body, the self, and systems of social control that we have created. When the structure of this architecture is compromised, either literally or metaphorically, we experience instability and vertigo. My practical submission, Vertigo is concerned with architecture, perspective, deconstruction, instability, vertigo, scale and the body. Vertigo consists of paintings, ranging in scale from the size of a brick to the height of a single storey house. Utilizing a highly representational style as well as working with abstract sign systems and technical plan drawings, I destabilize firstly, our sense of certainty in the architecture that surrounds us, and secondly, prompts us to question the <b>assumed</b> fixity of <b>ourselves</b> and our social systems, through the convergence and collision of architecture and painting. This supporting document, (Un) stable Architecture as Deconstructed Meaning, considers the key conceptual concerns informing my practical submission. In chapter one of this mini-thesis: Deconstructivist Architecture, Instability and Impermanence I look at Deconstructivist Architecture which challenges traditional values of order, stability, harmony and unity of architecture. I position my work in relation to architecture projects on the Deconstructivist Architecture show in relation to their intent of undoing, shifting and destabilizing structure and what architecture is traditionally valued for. I also look at the shifting meaning and symbolism of architecture and skyscrapers. In the second chapter: Vertiginous Point of View and Shifted Perspectives I engage with vertigo, perspective, scale and the bodily analogy in architecture. I look at how Julie Mehretu destabilises built space and architecture in a painterly way, depicting multiple perspectives which are subjected to multiple interpretations. In chapter Three: Painting a Building and Building a Painting: Process, Scale and the Body, I discuss and engage with my practical submission, Vertigo, in relation to my process, scale, the body, vertigo, deconstruction, instability and perspective...|$|R
60|$|It {{is to be}} {{observed}} from this list that for thirty {{years of his life}} Cicero was silent in regard to literature--for those thirty years in which the best fruits of a man's exertion are expected from him. Indeed, we may say that for the first fifty-two years of his life he wrote nothing but letters and speeches. Of the two treatises with which the list is headed, the first, in all probability, did not come from his pen, and the second {{is no more than a}} lad's translation from a Greek author. As to the work of translation, it must be understood that the Greek and Latin languages did not stand in reference to each other as they do now to modern readers. We translate in order that the pearls hidden under a foreign language may be conveyed to those who do not read it, and admit, when we are so concerned, that none can truly drink the fresh water from a fountain so handled. The Romans, in translating from the Greek, thinking nothing of literary excellence, felt that they were bringing Greek thought into a form of language in which it could be thus made useful. There was no value for the words, but only for the thing to be found in it. Thence it has come that no acknowledgment is made. We moderns confess that we are translating, and hardly <b>assume</b> for <b>ourselves</b> a third-rate literary place. When, on the other hand, we find the unexpressed thought floating about the world, we take it, and we make it our own when we put it into a book. The originality is regarded as being in the language, not in the thought. But to the Roman, when he found the thought floating about the world in the Greek character, it was free for him to adopt it and to make it his own. Cicero, had he done in these days with this treatise as I have suggested, would have been guilty of gross plagiarism, but there was nothing of the kind known then. This must be continually remembered in reading his essays. You will find large portions of them taken from the Greek without acknowledgment. Often it shall be so, because it suits him to contradict an assertion or to show that it has been allowed to lead to false conclusions. This general liberty of translation has been so frequently taken by the Latin poets--by Virgil and Horace, let us say, as being those best known--that they have been regarded by some as no more than translations. To them to have been translators of Homer, or of Pindar and Stesichorus, and to have put into Latin language ideas which were noble, was a work as worthy of praise as that of inventing. And it must be added that the forms they have used have been perfect in their kind. There has been no need to them for close translation. They have found the idea, and their object has been to present it to their readers in the best possible language. He who has worked amid the bonds of modern translation well knows how different it has been with him. There is not much in the treatise De Inventione to arrest us. We should say, from reading it, that the matter it contains is too good for the production of a youth of twenty-one, but that the language in which it is written is not peculiarly fine. The writer intended to continue it--or wrote as though he did--and therefore we may imagine that it has come to us from some larger source. It is full of standing cases, or examples of the law courts, which are brought up to show the way in which these things are handled. We can imagine that a Roman youth should be practised in such matters, but we cannot imagine that the same youth should have thought of them all, and remembered them all, and should have been able to describe them.|$|R
6000|$|The CHAIRMAN then {{requested}} that gentlemen would fill a bumper as full {{as it would}} hold, while he would say only a few words. He was {{in the habit of}} hearing speeches, and he knew the feeling with which long ones were regarded. He was sure that it was perfectly unnecessary for him to enter into any vindication of the dramatic art, which they had come here to support. This, however, he considered to be the proper time and proper occasion for him {{to say a few words}} on that love of representation which was an innate feeling in human nature. It was the first amusement that the child had. It grew greater as he grew up; and even in the decline of life nothing amuses so much as when a common tale is told with appropriate personification. The first thing a child does is to ape his schoolmaster by flogging a chair. The <b>assuming</b> a character <b>ourselves,</b> or the seeing others assume an imaginary character, is an enjoyment natural to humanity. It was implanted in our very nature to take pleasure from such representations, at proper times and on proper occasions. In all ages the theatrical art had kept pace with the improvement of mankind, and with the progress of letters and the fine arts. As man has advanced from the ruder stages of society, the love of dramatic representations has increased, and all works of this nature have keen improved in character and in structure. They had only to turn their eyes to the history of ancient Greece, although he did not pretend to be very deeply versed in its ancient drama. Its first tragic poet commanded a body of troops at the battle of Marathon. Sophocles and Euripides were men of rank in Athens when Athens was in its highest renown. They shook Athens with their discourses, as their theatrical works shook the theatre itself. If they turned to France in the time of Louis the Fourteenth--that era which is the classical history of that country--they would find that it was referred to by all Frenchmen as the golden age of the drama there. And also in England in the time of Queen Elizabeth the drama was at its highest pitch, when the nation began to mingle deeply and wisely in the general politics of Europe, not only not receiving laws from others, but giving laws to the world, and vindicating the rights of mankind. (Cheers.) There have been various times when the dramatic art subsequently fell into disrepute. Its professors have been stigmatized, and laws have been passed against them, less dishonourable to them than to the statesmen by whom they were proposed, and to the legislators by whom they were adopted. What were the times in which these laws were passed? Was it not when virtue was seldom inculcated as a moral duty that we were required to relinquish the most rational of all our amusements, when the clergy were enjoined celibacy, and when the laity were denied the right to read their Bibles? He thought that it must have been from a notion of penance that they erected the drama into an ideal place of profaneness, and spoke of the theatre as of the tents of sin. He did not mean to dispute that there were many excellent persons who thought differently from him, and he disclaimed the slightest idea of charging them with bigotry or hypocrisy on that account. He gave them full credit for their tender consciences, in making these objections, although they did not appear relevant to him. But to these persons, being, as he believed them, men of worth and piety, he was sure the purpose of this meeting would furnish some apology for an error, if there be any, in the opinions of those who attend. They would approve the gift, although they might differ in other points. Such might not approve of going to the theatre, but at least could not deny that they might give away from their superfluity what was required for the relief of the sick, the support of the aged, and the comfort of the afflicted. These were duties enjoined by our religion itself. (Loud cheers.) ...|$|R
