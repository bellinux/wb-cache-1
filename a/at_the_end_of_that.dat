5|$|A {{few months}} later, United Diamond Fields of British Guiana was {{incorporated}} as a limited company.

The price was to be fixed for six months, with an auditor's certificate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> time used to negotiate a new price. Oppenheimer {{was the only one}} with access to the accounting information, {{and the rest of the}} company had no way of checking that his figures were correct. In the same time frame, a new deposit of diamonds was discovered in South Africa, forcing the syndicate to acquire several million pounds worth of these new diamonds to prevent their control over the market being destroyed. This strained their finances and the new diamonds forced the price down.|$|E

In the third stage, the cyclists who were competing for the general classification started one hour earlier than the other cyclists, including Aucouturier. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> stage, a group of four cyclists had broken away, and Eugène Brange won the sprint. Aucouturier finished 27 minutes later, but this meant that he had run the course 33 minutes faster, so he was declared the winner of the stage. Garin retained the lead, helped by a crash of second-placed Pagie in the second stage, which eliminated him from the race.|$|E
5|$|As {{detected}} by the British, repairs to Tirpitz following Operation Tungsten progressed quickly. Work on repairing the battleship began in late April, and 157 shipyard workers and special equipment were transported from Kiel in Germany to Kaafjord {{to accelerate the}} project. Assisted by the long hours of daylight at Kaafjord's latitude during summer, three shifts of personnel worked on Tirpitz each day. The battleship was capable of moving under her own power by 2 June, and ready to begin gunnery exercises <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> month. The repair works concluded in mid-July, though the battleship's starboard propeller shaft could only be used to drive her forwards. Captain Wolf Junge assumed command of the battleship in May 1944, replacing Captain Hans Meyer who had been wounded during Operation Tungsten.|$|E
5|$|As {{had been}} the case at Northwestern, Notre Dame's {{football}} program {{was in a state}} of flux when Parseghian arrived. While Notre Dame built a proud history under Rockne and Frank Leahy, its two most successful coaches, the late 1950s and early 1960s had been a disaster. The team had finished 5–5 in 1962 under Joe Kuharich, who lost the confidence of his players and Notre Dame's administrators during his four years as coach. Kuharich's surprise departure <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> season to become supervisor of officials in the National Football League, a position created by his friend and NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, left the program in disarray. Devore, a long-time Notre Dame employee who had played for Rockne and coached under Leahy, was brought in to lead the team on an interim basis in 1963. Notre Dame managed only a 2–7 finish that year.|$|E
