5|$|In 1919, MacArthur became Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, which Chief of Staff Peyton March felt {{had become}} {{out of date}} in many respects and was much in need of reform. Accepting the post allowed MacArthur to retain his rank of brigadier general, instead of being reduced to his {{substantive}} rank of major {{like many of his}} contemporaries. When MacArthur moved into the superintendent's house with his mother in June 1919, he became the youngest superintendent since Sylvanus Thayer in 1817. However, whereas Thayer had faced opposition from outside the Army, MacArthur had to overcome resistance from graduates <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> board.|$|E

5|$|The Minister of Ceremonies (Taichang 太常) {{also known}} as Grand Master of Ceremonies, was the chief {{official}} in charge of religious rites, rituals, prayers, {{and the maintenance of}} ancestral temples and altars. The role's title was changed to Upholder of Ceremonies (Fengchang 奉常) from 195 to 144 BC before reverting to the original title.

5|$|Other {{victims were}} college students, {{many of whom}} were {{expelled}} from their institutions and had their careers destroyed, academic teachers who tried to defend the students <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> institutions themselves: Warsaw University had several departments administratively dissolved. Liberal intelligentsia members, Jewish or not, were removed from the government and other places of employment. Leftist intellectuals and student leaders lost what was left of their faith in the ostensibly socialist government. Finally the party itself was purged of many thousand suspect members, people who somehow did not fit the new environment of intolerance and hatred. The 1968 purges meant also the beginning of a large scale generational replacement of the party executive membership, a process that continued into the early 1970s, after Gomułka's departure. The prewar communist cadres were removed and people whose careers were formed in People's Poland took their place, which, early in his term, gave Gomułka's successor Edward Gierek one of the youngest in Europe elites of power.|$|E
5|$|The University of King's College is a {{post-secondary}} {{institution in}} Halifax affiliated with Dalhousie. Established in 1789, {{it was the}} first post-secondary institution in English Canada and the oldest English-speaking Commonwealth university outside the United Kingdom. The University of King's College was formerly an independent institution located in Windsor, Nova Scotia, until 1920, when a fire ravaged its campus. To continue operation, the University of King's College accepted a generous grant from the Carnegie Foundation, although the terms of the grant required that it move to Halifax and enter into association with Dalhousie. Under the agreement, King's agreed to pay the salaries of a number of Dalhousie professors, who in turn were to help in the management and academic life of the college. Students at King's were to have access to all of the amenities Dalhousie, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> programs at King's would fold into the College of Arts and Sciences at Dalhousie. Presently, students of both institutions are allowed to switch between the two throughout their enrolment. In spite of the shared academic programs and facilities, the University of King's College maintains its own scholarships, bursaries, athletics programs, and student residences.|$|E

The ground floor of the west wing and the mess hall {{on the first floor}} was turned into a large, well-heated office with glass-partitioned private offices, and equipped with typewriters and mimeograph machines. The new regimental office had strong contrast with their Pines Bridge Inn office, it having been drafty, dirt-floored and poorly-lit. The site opened for their use on October 8, 1918, and the regiment fully demobilized on February 1, 1919. A reunion was held at the former school grounds for many of the troops from March 23 to 25, 1919.|$|E
