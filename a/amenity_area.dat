40|$|An {{analysis}} of the regulations of herbicide use for weed control in non-agricultural/urban <b>amenity</b> <b>areas,</b> including actual pesticide use, was carried out as a joint survey of seven European countries: Denmark, Finland, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Sweden and United Kingdom. Herbicides constitute the {{major part of the}} pesticides used in urban <b>amenity</b> <b>areas.</b> Herbicide use on hard surfaces is the largest in terms of volume and potential contamination of surface and groundwater. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the differences in political interest and public debate on the 'use of pesticides in public urban amenity areas', regulations within each country at national, regional and local levels, possible use of alternative weed control methods and the amounts of pesticides used on urban <b>amenity</b> <b>areas.</b> A comparative analysis revealed major differences in political interest, regulations and availability of statistics on pesticide use. Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany have, or have had, a strong public and political interest for reducing the use of herbicides to control weeds in urban <b>amenity</b> <b>areas</b> and also have very strict regulations. The UK is currently undergoing a period of increasing awareness and strengthening regulation, while Latvia and Finland do not have specific regulations for weed control in urban <b>amenity</b> <b>areas</b> or on hard surfaces. Statistics on pesticide/herbicide use on urban <b>amenity</b> <b>areas</b> were only available in Denmark and the Netherlands. Developing this kind of information base reveals the differences in herbicide use, regulations and policies in European countries and may enhance the transfer of knowledge on sustainable weed control across countries. ...|$|R

Glengarriff also offers shops, art galleries, pubs, restaurants & other services.|$|E
50|$|The North British belatedly {{set about}} {{improving}} and expanding Waverley station. This {{was not easy}} because of the constrained location in a high <b>amenity</b> <b>area,</b> and hostility to railway encroachment was at a high level. Nonetheless, on 5 July 1891 the North British obtained Parliamentary powers to quadruple the line from Corstorphine (that is, Saughton Junction) {{in the west to}} Waverley, and from Waverley to Abbeyhill in the east. This involved duplicating the three tunnel sections. In addition Waverley station itself was much expanded, and when the work was completed in 1900 it covered 23 acres and had nineteen platforms. North Bridge was reconstructed and incorporated into the station structure; one-third of the cost was borne by the North British Railway, and the whole scheme at Waverley cost £1.5 million. The station was architecturally magnificent, although the baroque stone and joinery work in the booking hall was somewhat oppressive, and the pedestrian access from the street was still narrow and bleak.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{selective}} graminicide fluazifop-P-butyl is {{used for}} the control of grass weeds in dicotyledonous crops, and commonly applied in <b>amenity</b> <b>areas</b> to reduce grass productivity and promote wildflower establishment. However, evidence suggests that fluazifop-P-butyl might also have phytotoxic effects on some non-target plants. This study investigates the effects of fluazifop-P-butyl on the emergence, phytotoxicity and above-ground biomass of nine perennial wildflower species and two grass species, following pre- and post-emergent applications at half, full and double label rates in a series of glasshouse experiments. RESULTS: While pre- and post-emergent applications of fluazifop-P-butyl caused reductions in seedling emergence and increased phytotoxicity on native wildflower and grass species, these effects were temporary for the majority of wildflower species tested, and generally only occurred at the double application rate. No differences in biomass were observed at any of the rates, suggesting good selectivity and no long-term effects of fluazifop-P-butyl application on the wildflower species from either pre-emergent or post-emergent applications. CONCLUSION: These results have direct relevance to the management of <b>amenity</b> <b>areas</b> for biodiversity, as they confirm the suitability of these wildflower species for inclusion in seed mixtures where fluazifop-P-butyl is to be applied to control grass productivity...|$|R
