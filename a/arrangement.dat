5|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} a new <b>arrangement</b> for the genus, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram {{significantly different from}} George's <b>arrangement.</b> Thiele and Ladiges' <b>arrangement</b> retained B.brownii in series Spicigerae, placing it in B.subser. Occidentales along with B.occidentalis (red swamp banksia), B.seminuda (river banksia), B.verticillata (granite banksia) and B.littoralis (swamp banksia). This <b>arrangement</b> stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 <b>arrangement</b> in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series.|$|E

5|$|Adrian {{previously}} converted their downtown {{streets to}} one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973. The traffic pattern created an unusual <b>arrangement</b> in the routings {{of the two}} state highways downtown. Southbound M-52 followed Winter Street, which also carried both eastbound and westbound directions of the US223 business loop. These streets carried both highways around the downtown business district in this <b>arrangement</b> until November 2009.|$|E

5|$|After he had {{recorded}} his orchestration of the chorale prelude Christ lag in Todesbanden, BWV718, in 1931, Leopold Stokowski recorded his <b>arrangement</b> for symphonic orchestra of BWV4's fourth movement in 1937.

5|$|Carl Meissner demoted Eubanksia to {{sectional}} rank in his 1856 classification, {{and divided}} it into four series, with B.brownii placed in series Dryandroideae. When George Bentham published his 1870 <b>arrangement</b> in Flora Australiensis, he discarded Meissner's series, placing all the species with hooked styles {{together in a}} section that he named Oncostylis. This <b>arrangement</b> would stand for over a century.|$|E
5|$|Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele {{initiated}} a rearrangement of Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and publishing B.subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full <b>arrangement</b> once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim <b>arrangement,</b> then B.grossa {{is placed in}} B.subg. Spathulatae.|$|E

5|$|George's <b>arrangement</b> {{remained}} current until 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia. They {{also published}} B.subg. Spathulatae for the Banksia taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons, thus redefining B.subg. Banksia as comprising {{those that do}} not. They were not ready, however, to tender an infrageneric <b>arrangement</b> encompassing Dryandra, so as an interim measure they transferred Dryandra into Banksia at series rank. This minimised the nomenclatural disruption of the transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric <b>arrangement</b> to be set aside. Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, B.sessilis is placed in B.subg. Banksia, ser. Dryandra.|$|E
5|$|In 1442, Henry VI sanctioned an <b>arrangement</b> {{whereby the}} town was to pay the college £25 {{a year from the}} fee farm (a type of feudal tax) in {{exchange}} for decayed property, allegedly worth £30 a year, which the college could not afford to keep in repair. The <b>arrangement</b> was cancelled in 1450.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Austin Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery {{published}} {{the results of}} their cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for Banksia. They inferred a phylogeny very greatly different from the accepted taxonomic <b>arrangement,</b> including finding Banksia to be paraphyletic with respect to Dryandra. A new taxonomic <b>arrangement</b> was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B.subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full <b>arrangement</b> once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim <b>arrangement,</b> then B.spinulosa is placed in B.subg.

5|$|Marriage was {{considered}} a civil ceremony, rather than a religious one.
