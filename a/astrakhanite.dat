40|$|AbstractIn the Hallstatt salt mine (Austria), {{polyhalite}} rocks {{occur in}} 0. 5 – 1  m thick and several metre long tectonic lenses within the protocataclasite to protomylonite matrix of the Alpine Haselgebirge Fm [...]  Thin section analysis of Hallstatt polyhalites reveals various fabric types similar to metamorphic rocks of crust-forming minerals, e. g. quartz and feldspar. Polyhalite microfabrics from Hallstatt include: (1) polyhalite mylonites, (2) metamorphic reaction fabrics, (3) vein-filling, fibrous polyhalite and (4) cavity-filling polyhalite. The polyhalite mylonites contain {{a wide range}} of shear fabrics commonly known in mylonitic quartzo–feldspathic shear zones within the ductile crust and developed from a more coarse-grained precursor rock. The mylonites are partly overprinted by recrystallised, statically grown polyhalite grains. Metamorphic reaction fabrics of polyhalite fibres between blödite (or <b>astrakhanite)</b> [Na 2 Mg(SO 4) 2. 4 H 2 O] and anhydrite have also been found. According to previous reports, blödite may occur primarily as nodules or intergrown with löweite. Reaction fabrics may have formed by exsolution, (re-) crystallisation, parallel growth or replacement. This fabric type was only found in one sample in relation with the decomposition of blödite at ca. 61  °C in the presence of halite or slightly above, testifying, therefore, a late stage prograde fabric significantly younger than the main polyhalite formation...|$|E
40|$|Several {{variants}} of hydrated sodium cadmium bisulfate, Na(2) Cd(2) (SO(4)) (3) center dot 3 H(2) O, Na(2) Cd(SO(4)) (2) center dot 2 H(2) O, and Na(2) Cd(SO(4)) (2) center dot 4 H(2) O have been synthesized, and their thermal properties followed by phase transitions have been invesigated. The formation of these phases {{depends on the}} stochiometry and the time taken for crystallization from water. Na(2) Cd(2) (SO(4)) (3) center dot 3 H(2) O, which crystallizes in the trigonal system, space group P 3 c, is grown from the aqueous solution in about four weeks. The krohnkite type mineral Na(2) Cd(SO(4)) (2) center dot 2 H(2) O and the mineral <b>astrakhanite,</b> also known as blodite, Na(2) Cd (SO(4)) (2) center dot 4 H(2) O, crystallize concomittantly in about 24 weeks. Both these minerals belong to the monoclinic system(space group P 2 (1) /c). Na(2) Cd(2) (SO(4)) (3) center dot 3 H(2) O loses water completely when heated to 250 degrees C and transforms to a dehydrated phase (cubic system, space group I (4) over bar 3 d) whose structure has been established using ab initio powder diffration techniques. Na(2) Cd(SO(4)) (2) center dot 2 H(2) O transforms to alpha-Na(2) Cd(SO(4)) (2) (space group C 2 /c) on heating to 150 degrees C which is a known high ionic conductor and remains intact over prolonged periods of exposure to moisture (over six months). However, when alpha-Na(2) Cd(SO(4)) (2) is heated to 570 degrees C followed by sudden quenching in liquid nitrogen beta-Na(2) Cd(SO(4)) (2) (P 2 (1) /c) is formed. beta-Na(2) Cd(SO(4)) (2) takes up water from the atmosphere and gets converted completely to the krohnkite type mineral in about four weeks. Further, beta-Na(2) Cd(SO(4)) (2) has a conductivity behavior comparable to the a-form up to 280 degrees C, the temperature required for {{the transformation of the}} beta- to alpha-form. These experiments demonstrate the possibility of utilizing the abundantly available mineral sources as precursors to design materials with special properties...|$|E
