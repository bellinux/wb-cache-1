These results do not support growing blends to increase yield or stability. However, growing hybrid cultivars could result in increased yields while reducing variability compared with usual production practices.|$|R

40|$|To {{predict the}} {{combustion}} performance in pulverized coal-fired boilers, this paper examines existing indices and develops a maceral index (MI). These indices {{were compared with}} the data of 68 coals <b>and</b> <b>blends</b> {{in a range of}} the mean vitrinite reflectance from 0. 25 to 1. 63. The results showed that the fuel ratio and the mean vitrinite reflectance could qualitatively indicate the burnout of the coals <b>and</b> <b>blends.</b> The new MI, MI = L + V/R- 2 /I- 1. 25 (HV/ 30) (2. 5), provides a useful correlation for the burnout of the coals <b>and</b> <b>blends.</b> The correlation coefficient (I-) is 0. 982 for the EER data, and 0. 808 for the ACIRL data. The MI also has potential to correlate ignition and flame stability of the coals <b>and</b> <b>blends.</b> The MI predicts the burnout better than the other indices. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Shape memory {{polymers}} (SMPs) are {{a kind of}} {{very important}} smart polymers. In order to improve the properties or obtain new functions of SMPs, SMP composites <b>and</b> <b>blends</b> are prepared. We thoroughly examine the research in SMP composites <b>and</b> <b>blends</b> achieved by numerous research groups around the world. The preparation of SMPs composites <b>and</b> <b>blends</b> is mainly for five aims: (1) to improve shape recovery stress and mechanical properties; (2) to decrease shape recovery induction time by increasing thermal conductivity; (3) to create new polymer/polymer blends with shape-memory effect (SME); (4) to tune switch temperature, mechanical properties, and biomedical properties of SMPs; (5) to fabricate shape memory materials sensitive to electricity, magnetic, light and moisture. The trend of SMP composite development is discussed. SMP composites <b>and</b> <b>blends</b> exhibit novel properties that are different from the conventional SMPs and thus can be utilized in various applications.
