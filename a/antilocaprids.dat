5000|$|In most respects, <b>antilocaprids</b> {{resemble}} other ruminants. They have a complex, four-chambered {{stomach for}} digesting tough plant matter, cloven hooves, and {{are similar in}} body shape to antelopes. Their horns resemble those of the bovids, in {{that they have a}} true horny sheath, but, uniquely, they are shed outside of the breeding season, and subsequently regrown. Their lateral toes are even further diminished than in bovids, with the digits themselves being entirely lost, and only the cannon bones remaining. <b>Antilocaprids</b> have the same dental formula as most other ruminants: [...]|$|E
50|$|The long forked {{horns of}} Ramoceros {{may have been}} used by rival males in competition. Like other <b>antilocaprids,</b> Ramoceros regrew their horns every year, forming new horns growing on bony centers.|$|E
50|$|Cosoryx furcatus is an {{extinct species}} of <b>antilocaprid</b> {{that lived in}} the Miocene of Nevada.|$|R
50|$|It is {{the only}} {{surviving}} {{member of the family}} Antilocapridae. During the Pleistocene period, about 12 <b>antilocaprid</b> species existed in North America. Three other genera (Capromeryx, Stockoceros and Tetrameryx) existed when humans entered North America but are now extinct.|$|R
40|$|Fossil {{vertebrates}} {{from the}} Doeden gravel pit, Yellowstone River Valley near Miles City, Montana, document a diverse fauna with ground sloths (Megalonyx jeffersonii and Paramylodon harlani), mammoths (Mammuthus columbi), mastadon (Mammut americanum), horse (Equus sp.), artiodactyls (Camelops sp., Bootherium sp., cervid and <b>antilocaprid),</b> and giant short-faced bear (Arctodus simus) (Hill 2001 : Wilson 2003; Wilson and Hll 200, 2002). This paper discusses Doeden Local Fauna (DLF) sloth material...|$|R
50|$|Small mammals whose remains {{have been}} found in the cave include pikas, jackrabbits, cottontail rabbits, marmots, chipmunks, Peromyscus mice, woodrats, Microtus voles, and {{collared}} lemmings. Larger mammals represented in the cave include Canis species, red foxes, short-faced bears, weasels, martens, wolverines, American cheetahs, American lions, Equus species, Camelops, deer, <b>antilocaprids,</b> bison, bighorn sheep, and mammoths. Remains of the American cheetah are particularly abundant in the cave.|$|E
50|$|The <b>antilocaprids</b> {{evolved in}} North America, where they filled a niche {{similar to that}} of the bovids that evolved in the Old World. During the Miocene and Pliocene, they were a diverse and {{successful}} group, with many different species. Some had horns with bizarre shapes, or had four, or even six, horns. Examples include Osbornoceros, with smooth, slightly curved horns, Paracosoryx, with flattened horns that widened to forked tips, Ramoceros, with fan-shaped horns, and Hayoceros, with four horns.|$|E
40|$|The Family Antilocapridae is {{considered}} to have {{first appeared in the}} Early Hemingfordian of western North America. Here we report a mandible of a merycodontine antilocaprid from the Late Arikareean Harrison Formation of eastern Wyoming. The mandible has three lower molars preserved and mandibular ramus features that allow it to be differentiated from other contemporaneous selenodont artiodactyl families, yet the lack of detailed understanding of intraspecific variation in Paracosoryx and Merycodus warrant caution in assigning this to a genus. This new material predates the previous first appearance of <b>antilocaprids</b> by approximately 3 – 4 million years and suggests that antilocaprid immigration from Eurasian ruminant stock occurred earlier than previously assumed and that caution should be exercised when using first appearances in broader analyses...|$|E
50|$|Osbornoceros is an extinct {{artiodactyl}} genus of {{the family}} Antilocapridae. All <b>antilocaprid</b> species are extinct except for the pronghorn. Osbornoceros osborni is the only known species of the genus Osbornoceros. Osbornoceros lived during the Late Miocene around 7-6 million years ago in what is currently North America. It is well represented in fossil discoveries, with nearly a dozen specimens having been found to date. All come from the Chamita Formation in a quarry near Lyden, New Mexico, the site of numerous other finds {{such as that of}} Chamitataxus, a prehistoric badger who lived at the same time. The holotype specimen of Osbornoceros was discovered in 1937 and many more were found nearby during further expeditions.|$|R
40|$|The Doeden {{gravel pit}} near Miles City, Montana, has yielded an {{extensive}} fauna of large vertebrates including ground sloths Megalonyx jefferesonii and Glossotherium (Paramlydon) harlani mammoth (Mammuthus Columbi), mastadon (Mammut americanum), several ungulates (Equus ssp., Camelops sp., Bootherium sp., a cervid, and an <b>antilocaprid),</b> {{and a single}} specimen of the giant short-faced bear, Arctodus (Hill 1998, 2001; Hill and Schweitzer 1999; Wilson, in Kurtén and Anderson 1980 : 71; Wilson and Hill 2011). Material collected from the pit between 1976 and 1984 is in the collections of the Museum of the Rockies (MOR) and {{is the subject of}} continuing studies. Given the scarcity of Arctodus finds, the present note is addressed to describing this important specimen (MOR PL- 084 :B 0007) ...|$|R
40|$|A new biostratigraphic zonation for {{the middle}} Miocene Barstow Formation based on the {{mammalian}} megafauna is presented. Four biostratigraphic zones are outlined, two containing fossil assemblages of early Barstovian (Ba 1) age, and two with late Barstovian (Ba 2) assemblages. Recommendations are made for defining and characterizing the Barstovian North American Land Mammal Age (NALMA). The Ba 1 biochron is defined based on the first occurrence of Plithocyon, and {{the base of the}} Ba 2 biochron is revised based on the first appearance of the <b>antilocaprid</b> Ramoceros. The ursid Plithocyon remains a valid defining taxon for the base of the Barstovian NALMA. The use of both gomphotheriid and mammutid proboscideans to define the base of the Ba 1 or Ba 2 is abandoned due to the diachrony of first appearances across North America. The Ba 1 biochron is additionally characterized based on the first appearance of the equid Scaphohippus. The base of the Ba 2 biochron is revised based on the first appearance of Ramoceros. The Ba 2 can also be characterized by the first appearance of the borophagine canid Protepicyon and the anchitherine equid Megahippus...|$|R
40|$|Patterns {{of climate}} and C 4 plant {{abundance}} {{in the southwestern}} United States during the last glaciation were evaluated from isotopic study of herbivore tooth enamel. Enamel d 13 C values revealed a substantial eastward increase in C 4 plant consumption for Mammuthus spp., Bison spp., Equus spp., and Camelops spp. The d 13 C values were greatest in Bison spp. (26. 9 to 11. 7 ‰) and Mammuthus spp. (29. 0 to 10. 3 ‰), and in some locales indicated C 4 -dominated grazing. The d 13 C values of <b>Antilocaprids</b> were lowest among taxa (212. 5 to 27. 9 ‰) and indicated C 3 feeding at all sites. On the basis of modern correlations between climate and C 4 grass abundance, the enamel data imply significant summer rain in parts of southern Arizona and New Mexico throughout the last glaciation. Enamel d 18 O values range from 119. 0 to 131. 0 ‰ and generally increase to the east. This pattern could point to a tropical or subtropical source of summer rainfall. At a synoptic scale, the isotope data indicate that interactions of seasonal mois-ture, temperature, and lowered atmospheric pCO 2 determined glacial-age C 4 abundance patterns. © 1998 University of Washington.

40|$|From 1932 to 1950 {{vertebrate}} fossils {{were collected}} in the Hungry Valley area located in the northern half of the Black Mountain quadrangle, California. The fauna described in this paper was found between horizons approximately 350 feet below and 600 feet above the division established by Crowell separating the Hungry Valley formation and the Peace Valley beds. Fragmentary fossils {{and nature of the}} beds in which found suggest lake and alluvial fan deposits. The fauna is a typical plains fauna except for the absence of carnivores which were presumably present but found easy prey on grasslands well removed from the sites of deposition. Perissodactyls, among which are at least two species of Pliohippus (including the new species P. crowelli), a Neohipparion?, a tapir and a rhinocerotid, dominate the assemblage. Artiodaotyls include a new species of llama-like camel, Tanupolama? montis,	as well as a larger camel and an <b>antilocaprid.</b> The vertebrate-bearing strata overlie beds dated by Axelrod as middle Pliocene on the basis of plant remains. Crowell regarded the Peace Valley beds as middle Pliocene and the Hungry Valley formation as largely upper Pliocene. P. crowelli although apparently more advanced than P. spectans, is regarded as belonging to the Hemphillian stage. Largely on this basis, the Peace Valley beds and several hundred feet {{at the base of the}} Hungry Valley formation are referred to middle Pliocene; the bulk of the Hungry Valley formation is presumably upper Pliocene. This conclusion is in accord with the view that North American rhinoceroses became extinct by the close of the Hemphillian stage...|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the Pleistocene epoch, about 12,000 years ago, three {{dramatic}} developments {{occurred in}} the Americas at roughly the same time (geologically speaking). Paleoindians invaded and occupied the New World, the last glacial period came to an end, and a large fraction of the megafauna of both North and South America went extinct. This wave of extinctions swept {{off the face of the}} Earth many of the successful participants of the Great American Interchange, as well as other species that had not migrated. All the pampatheres, glyptodonts, ground sloths, equids, proboscids, giant short-faced bears, dire wolves and machairodont species of both continents disappeared. The last of the South and Central American notoungulates and litopterns died out, as well as North America's giant beavers, lions, dholes, native cheetahs, and many of its <b>antilocaprid,</b> bovid, cervid, tapirid and tayassuid ungulates. Some groups disappeared over most or all of their original range but survived in their adopted homes, e.g. South American tapirs, camelids and tremarctine bears (cougars and jaguars may have been temporarily reduced to South American refugia also). Others, such as capybaras, survived in their original range but died out in areas they had migrated to. Notably, this extinction pulse eliminated all Neotropic migrants to North America larger than about 15 kg (the size of a big porcupine), and all native South American mammals larger than about 65 kg (the size of a big capybara or giant anteater). In contrast, the largest surviving native North American mammal, the wood bison, can exceed 900 kg, and the largest surviving Nearctic migrant to South America, Baird's tapir, can reach 400 kg.|$|R
5000|$|Capromeryx minor, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the dwarf pronghorn, is a very small, extinct species of pronghorn-like <b>antilocaprid</b> ungulate discovered in the La Brea Tar Pits of California and elsewhere. It has been found {{at least as far}} east as the coast of Texas. It stood about 60 centimetres tall at the shoulders and weighed about 10 kilograms (22 lb). It is unclear whether females had horns as well as males. Each horn consists of a pair of short, straight points that sprout from a single base {{on either side of the}} head, with the two prongs parallel rather than diverging as in Tetrameryx and Stockoceros. A number of different species have been described which are likely all the same: Capromeryx furcifer, Capromeryx mexicana and Capromeryx minimus [...] Capromeryx furcifer would have priority as the proper name for the Late Irvingtonian through Rancholabrean species in which the anterior prong is less than 50% the height of the posterior prong. Its fossils have also been found at least as far east at as the Texas coast, as well as in Nebraska, Kansas, New Mexico, Sonora, Baja California, and near Mexico City. Specimens of this species (and its synonyms) date to the Late Irvingtonian and Rancholabrean periods. Two earlier species are known: Capromeryx tautonensis from Washington State and from Central Mexico in the Early Blancan, and Capromeryx arizonensis from the Late Blancan in Arizona, New Mexico and Florida. These two earlier species were larger and heavier than the Pleistocene species. It is thought by some biologists that it lived in forests and underbrush, where its small size would have helped it to hide. It is unlikely that it lived in open prairies, since it would not have been fast enough to outrun the predators of that time.|$|R
40|$|The University of Nebraska State Museum {{collections}} {{include a}} large sample of dentitions and skeletal {{elements of a}} late Pliocene <b>antilocaprid</b> which Kent (1963) has referred to the species Texoceros cf. guymonensis. At least 95 individuals are represented in this sample which was collected from the University of Nebraska State Museum locality Gd- 10, located in the SE¼ NE¼ sec. 29, T. 16 N., R. 44 W. Lower jaws and dentitions {{are the most common}} elements preserved in the sample. Individuals of two other species of pronghorns have previously been aged on the basis of characters of the lower dentition. Dow and Wright (1962) studied various stages of tooth replacement and wear presented by individuals of the modern pronghorn species, Antilocapra americana, whose ages were known. Voorhies (1969) studied a sample of the early Pliocene pronghorn, Merycodus furcatus, from Verdigre, Nebraska and was able to demonstrate the presence of discrete yearly age classes. Voorhies was able to suggest absolute ages for these classes by comparing wear stages with those exhibited by the living African duiker, Sylvicapra grimmia, which had been studied by Riney and Child (1960). The duiker was used in this comparison because it is similar in size to Merycodus. Texoceros is intermediate between Antilocapra and Mervcodus in geologic age and size. Because of its size, Texoceros would be expected to have matured more slowly than the smaller Merycodus and more rapidly than Antilocapra, a larger animal. Individuals of each genus which show the same stage of tooth replacement or wear would have three different ages with Merycodus being the oldest and Antilocapra, the youngest. Texoceros was aged {{on the basis of the}} mandibular dentitions. The criteria used were the degree of replacement of the deciduous cheek teeth and eruption of the permanent cheek teeth and the wear patterns on the occlusal surfaces of these teeth. Fossettes on the molars and premolars of Antilocapra disappear with age in a fairly rigid sequence (Dow and Wright, 1962). The same appears to be true for the fossettes on the molars of Texoceros. Crown height, which Voorhies (1969) used as a criteria for aging Merycodus, was not a realistic tool to use in this study for several reasons: the inadvisability of cutting into a large number of rami to expose the base of the crown, the difficulty of establishing a precise point from which to measure crown height and the presence of secondary cement which obscures the base of the crown. A study of the mandibular dentitions of the immature individuals in the sample of Texoceros showed that distinct age groups were present. The entire sample, therefore, was divided into groups based on the criteria mentioned previously and the minimum number of individuals in each group was determined using the method described by Voorhies (1969). Approximate absolute ages were assigned to each group by comparing the replacement and wear patterns with similar patterns exhibited by known-age individuals of Antilocapra and estimated-age individuals of Merycodus...|$|R
