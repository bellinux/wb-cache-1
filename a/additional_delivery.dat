30|$|The {{relatively}} high impact of traffic congestion on the CO 2 {{efficiency of the}} delivery trips may also be explained with the traffic effect on the total kilometers travelled.

40|$|Multiple {{delivery}} specifications {{exist on}} nearly all commodity futures contracts.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} scheduling n independent jobs on m identical machines that operate in parallel.

In addition, each job has a release date, when it becomes available for processing, and, after completing its processing, requires an <b>additional</b> <b>delivery</b> time. The objective is to minimize the time by which all jobs are delivered. In the notation of Graham et al. [4], this problem is noted P |rj|Lmax. We develop a polynomial time approximation scheme whose running time depends only linearly on n. This linear complexity bound gives a substantial improvement of the best previously known polynomial bound [5]. Finally, we discuss the special case of this problem {{in which there is a}} single machine and present an improved approximation scheme. ...|$|E
30|$|In contrast, {{from the}} {{perspective}} of former pure mail-order retailers, store pickup is generally a costly service. The costs come from the additional in-store handling effort compared to home delivery and margin losses through bearing the shipping costs instead of earning a fee from customers for home delivery. Store pickup is, therefore, offered, but not actively advertised by this type of retailers. This highlights one of the major drawbacks of <b>additional</b> <b>delivery</b> modes, “they are costly.” Shipping fees are only relevant for direct-to-customer deliveries. The fees demanded from customers depend on the competitive environment and country-specific traditions regarding direct deliveries. For example, in Germany only some fashion retailers that compelled to do so for competitive reasons ship absolutely free of charge. The non-fashion OC retailers charge shipping fees in dependence of order value. The main reason mentioned by all participants is that shipping fees generate significant additional revenue for the retailers. As long as customers are willing to pay, they will impose shipping fees.|$|E

5|$|The {{first section}} of the Bergen Line, the Gjøvik Line and the Roa–Hønefoss Line, was {{electrified}} in February 1961. This allowed diesel and electric locomotives to haul all trains from Oslo to Bergen. In 1962 the Nordland Line was completed to Bodø, but the increased need for locomotives was more than compensated by the electrification of the Bergen Line being extended to Ål. The first Di 3 ran on the Røros Line in 1964, {{that had previously been}} denied due to bridges with insufficient axle load permits. In 1965, the Bergen Line was electrified, and all but one Di 3 was transferred to Trondheim. A single unit, usually no. 610, was stationed at Finse Station as a snowplow. Along with <b>additional</b> <b>deliveries,</b> there were sufficient Di 3 units to terminate most steam operations.|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{delivery}} specifications {{exist on}} nearly all commodity futures contracts. Sellers are typically allowed {{to choose among}} several grades of the underlying commodity. On the delivery day, the futures price converges to the spot price of the cheapest-to-deliver grade rather than {{to that of the}} par-delivery grade of the commodity, thereby imposing an <b>additional</b> <b>delivery</b> risk on hedgers. This paper derives the optimal production and futures hedging strategy for a risk-averse competitive firm facing delivery risk. We show that the option value of the multiple delivery specification induces the firm to produce more with than without the delivery risk if the firm gauges this value higher than the market. We further show that if the delivery risk is additively related to the commodity price risk, the firm optimally under-hedges its risk exposure. On the other hand, if the delivery risk is multiplicatively related to the commodity price risk, the firm may optimally choose an under- or over-hedge which we illustrate using a numerical example. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Assessment of T-cell {{activation}} is pivotal {{for evaluation}} of cancer immunotherapy. We initiated a clinical trial in patients with MAGE-A 1 and/or -A 3 tumors using autologous DC pulsed with MAGE peptides aimed at analyzing T-cell-derived, IFN-gamma secretion by cytokine flow cytometry and ELISPOT. We also tested whether further KLH addition could influence this response favorably. Monocyte-derived DC were generated from leukapheresis products. They were pulsed with the relevant MAGE peptide(s) alone in group A (n= 10 pts) and additionally with KLH in group B (n= 16 pts). A specific but transient {{increase in the number}} of peripheral blood T lymphocytes secreting IFN-gamma in response to the vaccine peptide(s) was observed in 6 / 8 patients of group A and in 6 / 16 patients of group B.

40|$|Information and {{communications}} technologies (ICTs) {{have been at}} the heart of a transformation of public services in the UK, in a process that has seen the emergence of forms of ‘electronic public services ’ (EPS). Policy makers have hoped that EPS will bring about improved, convenient, accessible and cheaper public services. The Internet has been {{at the heart of a}}ttempts to deliver EPS. However, limiting factors affecting user uptake of web-based services, including skills and access issues, have encouraged service providers to consider <b>additional</b> <b>delivery</b> platforms. Interactive Digital Television (iDTV) has emerged as one possible platform, since it brings an interactive capacity to a medium that is both familiar and easy to use. This paper examines the ways in which the capabilities offered by iDTV technology have been exploited by policy makers and service providers. Reporting data from a number of research projects, this paper also explores the extent to which the technology has supported the emergence of high-quality and user-friendly services, and the extent to which users have valued and utilised such services. It concludes that while we now have a significant evidence base of provider and user experiences, the relative immaturity of the technology and the nature of the iDTV initiatives themselves has prevented a full investigation of EPS via iDTV...|$|E
