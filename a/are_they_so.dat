5|$|The Swedish {{automotive}} startup Uniti Sweden AB {{has been}} working on an electric city car entirely designed to be sustainable. The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the motivation is sustainability. So, why <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>so</b> heavy, and why are they the same cars? Where you just take out petrol and you put in the huge battery and you call it sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable and recycled material such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the fully automated factory provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work with the lights turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to accepting {{the states of}} heaven and hell, Catholicism envisages a third state before being admitted to heaven. According to Catholic doctrine, some souls are not sufficiently free from the [...] effects of sin and its consequences to enter the state of heaven immediately, nor <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>so</b> sinful and hateful of Christ as to be destined for hell either. Such souls, ultimately destined to be united with God in heaven, must first be cleansed through purgatory– a state of purification. Through purgatory, souls [...] "achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven." [...] The Church makes a distinction between mortal sin, which incurs both temporal punishment and eternal punishment, and venial sin, which incurs only temporal punishment. Mortal sin is a [...] "sin whose object is grave matter and which is also committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent." [...] "If it is not redeemed by repentance and God's forgiveness, it causes exclusion from Christ's kingdom and the eternal death of hell, for our freedom {{has the power to}} make choices for ever, with no turning back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote for}} the majority, the same five justices who had formed the {{corresponding}} bloc in [...] McMahon. He reiterated that Court's finding that arbitral procedures had improved sufficiently that judicial skepticism was no longer warranted. [...] "To the extent that Wilko rested on suspicion of arbitration {{as a method of}} weakening the protections afforded in the substantive law to would-be complainants, it has fallen far out of step with our current strong endorsement of the federal statutes favoring this method of resolving disputes," [...] he wrote. [...] "Once the outmoded presumption of disfavoring arbitration proceedings is set to one side, it becomes clear that the right to select the judicial forum and the wider choice of courts are not such essential features of the Securities Act that § 14 is properly construed to bar any waiver of these provisions. Nor <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>so</b> critical that they cannot be waived under the rationale that the Securities Act was intended to place buyers of securities on an equal footing with sellers." ...|$|E
