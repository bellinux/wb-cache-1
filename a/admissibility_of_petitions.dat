[...] In other words, unless the reason for an objection comes into light only in the written decision of the Board of Appeal, not raising an objection under Rule 106 EPC {{as early as possible}} during the appeal proceedings may be fatal to the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> a <b>petition</b> for review. An objection under Rule 106 must be immediately recognizable by the Board of Appeal and it must be specific, i.e. [...] "the party must indicate unambiguously which particular defect of those listed in paragraph 2(a) to (c) of Article 112a and Rule 104 EPC it intends to rely on".|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of domestic violence, quite {{common in the}} countries of Eastern Europe, including Romania, can {{be perceived as a}} consequence of shortcomings in the education of person, or a faulty education. The aims of current study is to present and analyze the legal instruments designed in the area of civil law due to combat and prevent domestic violence, with a special regard to the protective order governed by the law No. 217 / 2003, as amended and republished. Legal provisions are analyzed with regarded to the person who may apply for order of protection, the conditions for the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>petition</b> for the issuance of the protective order, the measures which may be imposed by an protection order, the duration of these measures, the conditions for revocation of the protective order etc. The study reveals the practical application of analyzed legal provisions, by referring to the decisions given by Romania courts in cases involving the “protective order”. Finally are exposed the advantages and shortcomings of normative framework already existing, as well as the effectiveness of the legal provisions in practice...|$|R

Admissibility is an interesting problem in statistical theory and received much attention. [18, 19] and [20] discussed the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> predictions of y_T. [21, 22] and [23] studied the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> estimations of β. We discuss the admissible predictors of δ in classes of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous linear predictors, respectively. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the simultaneous prediction to be admissible are provided.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a {{relation}} between exponential dichotomy on time scales and <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the pair (C_rd^b(T^+, X),L^p(T^+,X)) for an evolution family on time scales. We establish a sufficient criterion {{for the existence}} of exponential dichotomy on time scales in terms <b>of</b> the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the pair (C_rd^b(T^+, X),L^p(T^+,X)) for the evolution family. Conversely, with the help of exponential dichotomy on time scales, we give the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> the pair (C_rd^b(T^+, X),L^p(T^+,X)) for an input-output equation on time scales.|$|R

Can the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice be called the Common Evidence Area? From the national perspective, the issue <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> evidence is still subject to divergent solutions in the Member States, concerning the common law and continental law systems, i. e. the right of access to a lawyer.

These methods determine <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> rules in $S 4 $, but they don't determine or give substitutions rejecting inadmissible rules. In this paper, we investigate some relations between one of the above methods, based on the reduced normal form rules, and sets of substitutions which reject them.
