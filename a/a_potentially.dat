5|$|Hydrogen azide (HN3) {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1890 by the oxidation of aqueous hydrazine by nitrous acid. It is very explosive and even dilute solutions can be dangerous.

It {{may be considered}} the conjugate acid of the azide anion, and is similarly analogous to the hydrohalic acids.|$|E

5|$|Solutions at {{more than}} 25% acetic acid are handled in a fume hood because of the pungent, {{corrosive}} vapour. Dilute acetic acid, {{in the form of}} vinegar, is practically harmless.

It has also been argued that the dominance of the Big Four has made the game predictable or even boring.|$|E

5|$|As a Republican {{representing}} heavily-Democratic Maryland, Mathias faced <b>a</b> <b>potentially</b> difficult re-election {{bid for the}} 1974 election.

Mathias was renominated by Republicans, fending off a primary election challenge from conservative doctor Ross Pierpont. Pierpont was never a substantial threat to Mathias, whose lack of competition was due in part to fallout from the Watergate scandal.|$|E
5|$|Between November 27, 2006, and April 1, 2007, 3329 {{images of}} the star WASP-13 by the SuperWASP-North program based at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands led to the {{identification}} of WASP-13 as host to <b>a</b> <b>potentially</b> transiting object. Photometric follow-up observations were taken on February 16, 2008 using the James Gregory Telescope (JGT) in Scotland, which took 1047 exposures of the star, although the last twenty images taken were obscured by cloud cover and were discarded.
