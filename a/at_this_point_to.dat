5|$|In {{possibly}} {{the last years}} of the 15th century, the Sanmicheli were involved in the stone decoration of the Caprioli chapel in the Church of San Giorgio, for which Cairano, almost simultaneously, prepared his Adoration, demonstrating for the first time outside of the Loggia a cooperation between the two studios. Bartolomeo Sanmicheli, {{at the beginning of the}} new century, attempted <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> make a comeback in the local art scene with the Ark of San Tiziano of 1505, characterized by a strong decorative quality. He possibly also aspired to the commission of the ark of Sant'Apollonio, which had been up for grabs since the discovery of the relics of the holy bishop in 1503. An early involvement of Sanmicheli can be surmised in the Martinengo mausoleum, but the commission was awarded to Bernardino dei Crossi in 1503. However, based on the prevailing decorative nature of the monument, which is much more rigorously classical, it can be attributed to Cairano.|$|E

5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E

NY890 terminates {{at the south end of}} the trumpet interchange, and I-890 continues southeastward on NY890's right-of-way along the Mohawk River toward downtown Schenectady.|$|E

25|$|The Germans {{planned to}} {{surprise}} the Dutch and so catch them off guard, {{allowing them to}} isolate {{the head of the}} Dutch Army. It was their intention to fly over the Netherlands, in order to lull the Dutch into thinking that England was their target.

It was expected that the queen and the commander in chief of the Dutch forces, Henri Winkelman, might agree <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> surrender. However, if the Dutch did not surrender, the Germans planned to cut off all roads leading to The Hague in order to quell any subsequent Dutch counter-attack.|$|E
25|$|The season {{started with}} a convincing win over the Wightlink Raiders, with a 13–1 scoreline. A {{successful}} 1998 was followed by controversy {{at the beginning of}} 1999, when it emerged that the team had spent three times their seasons budget by Christmas. Five players were released from their contracts <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> try to ease the financial burden on the club, including import Chad Brandimore and club captain Simon Mills. By mid March the team were floundering in the league, and {{it became clear that the}} team would not be taking part in the end of season play-offs due to their financial problems. However, this did not deter the fans, as almost 1,500 watched a 10–9 victory over Chelmsford and a close 7–6 defeat to the hands of Milton Keynes at the close of the league campaign. The victory over Chelmsford meant that this season's team had won more home games than any previous year since the team's formation in 1991.|$|E
