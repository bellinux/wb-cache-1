It is unclear how the new-style units differed from the old-style ones, but those stationed on the border (<b>as</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> in the comitatus) may have been smaller, perhaps half the size. In sectors other than the Danube, old-style auxiliary regiments survived.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on their}} {{similarity}} to the Altar of the City Patrons, art historians have attributed other paintings to Lochner, although a number have {{questioned whether the}} diary entry was authentically made by Dürer. Documentary evidence linking the paintings and miniatures with the historical Lochner has also been challenged, most notably by the art historian Michael Wolfson in 1996. In either case, the extent of Lochner's direct hand, <b>as</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> of workshop members or followers, is debated. Some panels formerly attributed to him are now thought to date from after 1451, the year of his death.|$|E

Modern industrial chimneys sometimes consist of a concrete windshield with a number of flues on the inside.|$|E

40|$|Animals {{are known}} to have evolved many {{different}} characters in order to improve their chances during the sexual selection. These secondary sexual characters should correlate with given male´s quality of ejaculate, according to previous research. The literal part of this paper shows us, that the longer the sperm was, the faster, more viable and agile it was. There was a connection between the viability and the length of the middle part of the sperm, that holds the mitochondria. At the same time, sperms with longer tails were faster, <b>as</b> <b>oppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> with bigger heads, that were slower. This paper was meant to clarify the influence the sperm phenotype on male's ejaculate. For this paper, which focuses on Great tit, the sperm length was chosen as the character of quality. Not only the length of the whole sperm, but also the length of all of its parts were measured. Every one of these parts is associated with the movement and the viability of the sperm in its own way. We tested whether the length of the sperm correlates with characters of the condition or not. The characters we had chosen for this were the length of melanine ornament, the weight of the male, the length of tars and number of leukocytes in blood. The results show that the length of the sperm head correlates with the length of melanine ornament of Great tit. We did not find any other connection among the other secondary sexual characters we had chosen...|$|R

25|$|The high {{incidence}} of liver transplants given to those with alcoholic cirrhosis {{has led to a}} recurring controversy regarding the eligibility of such patients for liver transplant.

This viewpoint was most famously articulated and propagated by Edward Said in Orientalism (1978), a critical history of this scholarly tradition. In contrast, the term has also been used by some modern scholars to refer to writers of the Imperialist era who had pro-Eastern attitudes, <b>as</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who saw nothing of value in non-Western cultures.|$|E

Previously, the regional Eastern and Western champions that played in the Grey Cup were determined by playoffs between the winners of each region's leagues.
