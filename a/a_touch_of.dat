5|$|After the March 1976 coup, Berni {{moved to}} New York City, where he {{continued}} painting, engraving, collaging and exhibiting. New York {{struck him as}} luxurious, consumerist, materially wealthy and spiritually poor. He conveyed these observations in subsequent work with <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> social irony. His New York paintings display a great protagonism of color and include Aeropuerto (Airport), Los Hippies, Calles de Nueva York (Streets of New York), Almuerzo (Lunch), Chelsea Hotel and Promesa de castidad (Promise of Chastity). He also produced several decorative panels, scenographic sketches, illustrations, and collaborations for books.|$|E

(2007).

5|$|Here {{came the}} Rabbi, his back bent, his face shaved... His mere {{presence}} among the deportees added <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> unreality to the scene.

One by one they passed in front of me, teachers, friends, others, all those I had been afraid of, all those I once could have laughed at, all those I had lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.|$|E
5|$|In 2007/08 Omega FM was {{established}} in West London and became actively involved in political discussions. By late 2010 {{it was clear that}} Omega FM was {{following in the footsteps of}} pioneering black political pirate stations such as Galaxy FM and Genesis FM, adopting a similar format playing information documentaries concerning black history and Pan Afrikan ideologies along with Nation of Islam and The Nuwaubian ideologies as well as alternative approaches on current affairs, while also playing mostly Reggae music with <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> other genres of black music that is often politically orientated.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, MGM was keen on remaking Grand Hotel (1932), {{and hoped}} to lure Grant into {{coming out of}} {{retirement}} to star. Hitchcock had long {{wanted to make a}} film based on the idea of Hamlet, with Grant in the lead role. Grant stated that Warren Beatty had made a big effort to try to get him {{to play the role of}} Mr. Jordan in Heaven Can Wait (1978), which eventually went to James Mason. Morecambe and Stirling claim that Grant had also expressed an interest in appearing in <b>A</b> <b>Touch</b> <b>of</b> Class (1973), The Verdict (1982) and a film adaptation of William Goldman's 1983 novel Adventures in the Screen Trade.|$|E

5|$|It {{may be that}} in {{the mind}} of their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex Pistols were never meant {{to be more than a}} nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> the old épater la bourgeoisie. It may also be that {{in the mind of}} their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols were meant to be a force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex Pistols were all of these things.|$|E
5|$|Her {{mother died}} from {{diphtheria}} on December 7, 1892, and Elliott Jr. {{died of the}} same disease the following May. Her father, an alcoholic confined to a sanitarium, died on August 14, 1894 after jumping from a window during a fit of delirium tremens. He survived the fall but died from a seizure. Eleanor's childhood losses left her prone to depression throughout her life. Her brother Hall later suffered from alcoholism. Before her father died, he implored her {{to act as a}} mother towards Hall, and it was a request she made good upon for the rest of Hall's life. Eleanor doted on Hall, and when he enrolled at Groton School in 1907, she accompanied him as a chaperone. While he was attending Groton, she wrote him almost daily, but always felt <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> guilt that Hall had not had a fuller childhood. She took pleasure in Hall's brilliant performance at school, and was proud of his many academic accomplishments, which included a master's degree in engineering from Harvard.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Exorcist was re-released in a 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback, hardcover, and {{audiobook}} formats {{with new}} cover artwork. As described by Blatty, this new, updated edition features new and revised material. The 40th Anniversary Edition of The Exorcist will have <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> new material {{in it as}} part of an all-around polish of the dialogue and prose. First time around I never had the time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable – plus one new character in a totally new very spooky scene. This is the version I would like to be remembered for. Tor/Forge have also re-published The Ninth Configuration and Legion, with new, updated cover artwork.|$|E

5|$|Most famous {{among the}} many temples built by the Wodeyars is the Chamundeshwari Temple atop the Chamundi Hill. The {{earliest}} structure here was consecrated in the 12th century and was later patronised by the Mysore rulers. Maharaja Krishnaraja III added a Dravidian-style gopuram in 1827. The temple has silver-plated doors with images of deities. Other images include those of the Hindu god Ganesha and of Maharaja Krishnaraja III with his three queens. Surrounding the main palace in Mysore and inside the fort are a group of temples, built in various periods. The Prasanna Krishnaswamy Temple (1829), the Lakshmiramana Swamy Temple whose earliest structures date to 1499, the Trinesvara Swamy Temple (late 16th century), the Shweta Varaha Swamy Temple built by Purnaiah with <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> Hoysala style of architecture, the Prasanna Venkataramana Swami Temple (1836) notable for 12 murals of the Wodeyar rulers. Well-known temples outside Mysore city are the yali ("mythical beast") pillared Venkataramana temple built in the late 17th century in the Bangalore fort, and the Ranganatha temple in Srirangapatna.|$|E
