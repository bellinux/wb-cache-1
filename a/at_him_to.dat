Elsewhere, Leland Palmer (Ray Wise), still {{mourning}} Laura's death, dances {{in his living}} room, sobbing and holding a portrait of Laura as he does so. He breaks open the picture's frame, cutting his hands, as his wife Sarah (Grace Zabriskie) screams <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stop.|$|E
5|$|Lavelli {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Hudson, Ohio, a small town in the northeastern part of the state. Both of his parents were Italian immigrants. His father Angelo Lavelli was a {{blacksmith}} who made shoes for horses on nearby farms. As a child, he practiced catching by throwing baseballs against walls and trying to catch them when they bounced back. He liked to have friends throw ping-pong balls <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> see if he could catch them.|$|E

5|$|Teammate {{and quarterback}} Benny Lom chased Riegels, {{screaming}} <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stop. Known for his speed, Lom {{finally caught up}} with Riegels at California's 3-yard line and tried to turn him around, but he was immediately hit by a wave of Tech players and tackled back to the 1-yard line. The Bears chose to punt rather than risk a play so close to their own end zone, but Tech's Vance Maree blocked Lom's punt for a safety, giving Georgia Tech a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|The {{positioning}} of these figures closely {{resembles that of}} two persons depicted in the van Eyck panel. In that painting the right-hand figure turns to face his companion, gesturing <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> look outwards. In the van der Weyden, the equivalent figure seems protective of his friend, who here is female, while the left-hand figure in the earlier panel might represent {{a tribute to the}} artist's brother Hubert who had died in the 1420s. A red headdress was an indicator of self-portraiture for van Eyck. As in the van Eyck, the figures act as examples of repoussoir, in that they draw our attention to the picture's underlying theme – the painting's ability to visualize the infinity of the world in the landscape. The painting may allude to the concept of paragone; the man points to the landscape, perhaps highlighting the ability of painting, unlike sculpture, to supply its foreground with background.|$|E
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1877, Spring-heeled Jack was {{reportedly}} seen at Newport Arch, in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, wearing a sheep skin. An angry mob supposedly chased him and cornered him, and just as in Aldershot a while before, residents fired <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> no effect. As usual, he {{was said to have}} made use of his leaping abilities to lose the crowd and disappear once again.|$|E

Once, when the two horses fought, the young bin Laden pointed a gun at Khadr, yelling <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stop the fight before his prized Arabian was killed.|$|E
25|$|Shooting {{episodes of}} Deadliest Catch is a {{dangerous}} occupation for the camera crews on board the boats. In the early seasons, when many of the camera crews {{had little or no}} experience on crab boats, they frequently ran into dangers not normally encountered when shooting a documentary. Northwestern captain Sig Hansen told talk show host Jimmy Kimmel that he saved a cameraman's life during the first season, screaming <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{get out of the way}} just seconds before a 900-pound crab pot swinging from a crane crossed the space where the cameraman was standing. In another incident, showcased on the behind the scenes special, an inattentive cameraman had his leg fall through an open hatch on the deck of one of the boats when he unwittingly stepped into the hole, suffering three broken ribs (and, according to the cameraman, having to buy a case of beer for the entire crew as per tradition on crab boats).|$|E
25|$|Grand Master Oogway, an old {{tortoise}} and Shifu's mentor, has {{a vision}} that Shifu's former student, the evil snow leopard Tai Lung, will escape from prison {{and return to the}} Valley of Peace to take revenge for being denied the Dragon Scroll, which is said to hold the secret to limitless power. Shifu is alarmed and sends his messenger, the goose Zeng, with a request for the prison to heighten security in order to prevent Tai Lung's escape. He then holds a kung fu tournament for the Furious Five so that Oogway may identify the Dragon Warrior, the one kung fu master worthy of receiving the Dragon Scroll and capable of defeating Tai Lung. Forced to take a cumbersome noodle cart to the tournament, Po arrives as the arena doors close and is unable to enter. Desperate to see the Dragon Warrior chosen, Po straps himself to a set of fireworks, rockets into the sky, and crashes {{into the middle of the}} arena and opens his eyes to see Oogway pointing his finger <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>To</b> the shock of everyone present, Oogway proclaims Po as the Dragon Warrior.|$|E

25|$|In episode 4, Agnes urges Kat {{to return}} to Spain, and when Dermott learns of this, he confronts Agnes about taking him from his mother. In episode 5, Agnes tells Dermott to keep Kat away from the christening of Bernie Kelly's (Susan Ateh) baby, but Dermott says Kat has made him feel welcome and invited him to meet his {{brothers}} in Spain, so Agnes reveals that Dermott has a twin sister. Dermott confronts Kat over this, {{who said she was}} waiting for the right time and insists there is nothing else that Dermott does not know. In episode 6, Bernie, a local garda, asks Kat about the last time she saw Lance and Kat wonders if she suspects something happened, but Bernie denies this. Meanwhile, Kat is unaware that Alfie is having an operation on his brain tumour. Alfie asks Dermott to find Kat and bring her to the hospital, as it means they are unable to go back to Spain. Bernie works out that Dermott was involved in Lance's death, and sees him on the beach with Kat. Kat tells Dermott that Bernie was asking about him. He sees the garda arriving so takes Kat in a boat, saying they will try to find the whale that was recently seen off the coast. Bernie shouts <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stop and calls the coastguard. Kat asks Dermott if he did something to Lance. Dermott then accidentally crashes the boat into a rock and Kat is thrown into the water and then cut by the propellor. Dermott gets Kat out of the sea but there is nobody around to help. Meanwhile, Alfie has his operation but loses his pulse and the medical staff start to resuscitate.|$|E

500|$|Despite these {{regional}} differences, Hampton credits Illmatic {{with providing}} a common artistic ground for rappers on the West Coast and East Coast rap scenes. In the 2009 essay [...] "Born Alone, Die Alone," [...] she recounts the album's impact on West Coast artist, Tupac Shakur. While {{working as a}} journalist for The Source in 1994, Hampton covered three court cases involving Tupac. Around this time, she received an advance-copy of Illmatic and immediately dubbed a cassette version for Tupac, who became [...] "an instant convert" [...] of the album. The next day, she writes, Tupac [...] "arrived in his assigned courtroom blasting Illmatic so loudly that the bailiff yelled <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> turn it off before the judge took his seat on the bench." [...] In her essay, Hampton implies that Nas' lyricism might have influenced Tupac's acclaimed album, Me Against the World, which was recorded that same year.|$|E

Charlie says he can deliver the baby, but after he accidentally confesses that he is a recovering drug addict, she yells <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> get Jack, which leaves her alone in the jungle. Charlie finds Ethan and tells him that Claire is in labor and to get Jack. Charlie goes back to comfort Claire, who tells him the story about the psychic. Charlie suggests that the psychic knew the flight was going to crash, and this was his way of forcing Claire to raise the baby by herself. Claire stops having contractions.|$|E
500|$|On November 1, 1950, Puerto Rican nationalists Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo {{attempted}} to assassinate Truman at Blair House. The attack drew new attention to security concerns surrounding Truman's residence at Blair House.

On the street outside the residence, Torresola mortally wounded a White House policeman, Leslie Coffelt. Before he died, the officer shot and killed Torresola. Collazo was wounded and stopped before he entered the house. [...] He {{was found guilty of}} murder and sentenced to death in 1952. Truman commuted his sentence to life in prison. To try to settle the question of Puerto Rican independence, Truman allowed a plebiscite in Puerto Rico in 1952 to determine the status of its relationship to the U.S. Nearly 82% of the people voted in favor of a new constitution for the Estado Libre Asociado, a continued 'associated free state.' ...|$|E

Impressed by Andy's deviousness, {{the rest of the}} office does not warn Dwight, saying that Andy [...] "deserves the win". Andy pins Dwight between the car and the large bushes in the parking lot. Jim races out to check that Andy and Dwight are not seriously injured, but they snap <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go away. The two bicker back and forth about Angela. However, the fight goes out of Dwight when he learns Andy has had sex with Angela, because she told him that {{he was the only one}} she had had sex with. Crestfallen, Dwight and Andy both admit defeat and return to the office, where Andy calls to cancel his wedding cake, and Dwight throws away a bobblehead doll Angela previously bought him as a gift.

HuffPost TV Crystal Bell applauded Adler [...] "for doing such an amazing job" [...] on the suicide scene. She stated, [...] "I would have preferred if Karofsky's story line would have been the focus of the entire episode." [...] VanDerWerff commented that [...] "as the show got the little details of Karofsky's desperate act just right, the whole thing took on a weight", and singled out the scene [...] "where the teachers talked about what had happened and the smash cut to Karofsky's father screaming <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> get up" [...] as [...] "heart-wrenching".

500|$|Before the {{televised}} broadcast began, Tito Santana defeated Papa Shango {{in a dark}} match. Actress and Singer Diahann Carroll sang a rendition of [...] "America the Beautiful" [...] before the show. In the first match of the pay-per-view event, WWF Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels was accompanied to the ring by a new valet, Luna Vachon. Sensational Sherri followed Tatanka to the ring to prevent Vachon from getting involved in the match. During the match, Vachon approached Tatanka twice outside the ring, but Sherri was able to intervene and stop Vachon from interfering. Tatanka {{spent much of the}} match trying to injure Michaels with an armbar hold. Michaels gained the advantage and almost pinned Tatanka with a victory roll, but Tatanka escaped the pin attempt and performed a war dance to channel his energy. Michaels threw Tatanka out of the ring and tried to jump <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> attack, but Tatanka moved. Michaels was unable to return to the ring within ten seconds; he pulled the referee out of the ring. Tatanka was awarded the victory by countout but did not win the championship because titles can only change hands as a result of pinfall or submission. Vachon attacked Sherri after the match, and Tatanka had to help Sherri make it back to the dressing rooms.|$|E
