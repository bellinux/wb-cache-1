40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that when <b>appraised</b> <b>as</b> threatening, fear appeals (messages that {{highlight}} the negative consequences of failure) are related to more negative emotions, maladaptive motivations, and lower grades. This study asks the question of how subjective-task values and academic self-efficacy are related to challenge as well as threat appraisals of fear appeals. Data were collected from 923 students preparing for a high-stakes secondary school leaving examination and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Fear appeals were positively related to subjective-task values and academic self-efficacy when <b>appraised</b> <b>as</b> challenging and negatively related when <b>appraised</b> <b>as</b> threatening. The effectiveness of fear appeals as a motivational strategy depends on how they are interpreted and understood by the student. Teachers require training to be able to judge which messages are likely to be effective for which students. © 201...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{systematically}} reviewed literature {{investigating the}} relationship between appraisals of voices and distress. The review included 26 studies, published between 1990 and 2008. Several types of appraisals {{were found to be}} linked to higher levels of distress in voice hearers, including voices <b>appraised</b> <b>as</b> malevolent, voices <b>appraised</b> <b>as</b> high in supremacy, voices appraised to have personal acquaintance with the individual, and attitudes of disapproval and rejection towards voices. However, results from cognitive therapy trials did not consistently report significant improvements in voice related distress post-intervention. One explanation for this finding is that mediating variables, such as social schemata, exist within the appraisal–distress relationship, variables which were not targeted in the cognitive therapy trials...|$|R

40|$|Envy is a {{frustrating}} emotion that arises from upward social comparison. Two studies investigated the appraisals that distinguish benign envy (aimed at improving one’s own situation) from malicious envy (aimed at pulling down the superior other). Study 1 found that appraisals of deservingness and control potential differentiated {{both types of}} envy. We manipulated these appraisals in Study 2 and found that while both did not influence the intensity of envy, they did determine the type of envy that resulted. The more a situation was <b>appraised</b> <b>as</b> undeserved, the more participants experienced malicious envy. Benign envy was experienced more when the situation was not undeserved, and the most when the situation was <b>appraised</b> <b>as</b> both deserved and controllable. The current research also clarifies how the types of envy differ from the related emotions admiration and resentment...|$|R
