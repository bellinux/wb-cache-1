5|$|At 16:02, {{still waiting}} for a {{definitive}} report on {{the location of the}} Japanese fleet carriers, the U.S. carriers' radar detected the first incoming wave of Japanese strike aircraft. Fifty-three F4F-4 Wildcat fighters from the two U.S. carriers were directed by radar control towards the attackers. However, communication problems, limitations of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>identification</b> capabilities of the radar, primitive control procedures, and effective screening of the Japanese dive bombers by their escorting Zeros, prevented all {{but a few of the}} U.S. fighters from engaging the Vals before they began their attacks on the U.S. carriers. Just before the Japanese dive bombers began their attacks, Enterprise and Saratoga cleared their decks for the impending action by launching the aircraft that they had been holding ready in case the Japanese fleet carriers were sighted. These aircraft were told to fly north and attack anything they could find, or else to circle outside the battle zone, until it was safe to return.|$|E
5|$|Deceptive {{markings}} on helicopters further complicated matters for NATO pilots. Many of the combatants painted their helicopters {{to look like}} those of organizations that the UN's Zagreb Flight Coordination Center had authorized to fly in restricted space. For example, {{the army of the}} Republika Srpska often painted a Red Cross logo on their helicopters, and Croatian helicopters were given markings similar to those of UN humanitarian aid helicopters. The questionable identity of these helicopters became particularly problematic after the Black Hawk Incident in Iraq, because NATO pilots became more reluctant to engage potential belligerents without clear identification. As a result of the rules of engagement and difficulties in <b>aircraft</b> <b>identification,</b> NATO forces proved unable to stop most unauthorized helicopter flights, resulting in a documented total of 5711 unauthorized flights during the conflict.|$|E

50|$|In Tora! Tora! Tora!, {{an error}} {{involves}} {{the model of}} the Japanese carrier Akagi. In the film, Akagi's bridge island is positioned on the starboard side of the ship, which is typical on most aircraft carriers. However, the aircraft carrier Akagi was an exception; its bridge island was on the port side of the ship. Despite this, the bridge section appeared accurately as a mirrored version of Akagi's real port-side bridge. Secondly, all the Japanese aircraft in the footage bear the markings of Akagis aircraft (a single vertical red stripe following the red sun symbol of Japan), even though five other aircraft carriers participated, each having its own markings. In addition, the markings do not display the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>identification</b> numbers {{as was the case in}} the actual battle. The white surround on the roundel on the Japanese aircraft was only used from 1942 onwards. Prior to this the roundel was red only.|$|R
2500|$|The Allied {{reporting}} {{name was}} [...] "Oscar", {{but it was}} often called the [...] "Army Zero" [...] by American pilots because it bore a certain resemblance to the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, the Imperial Japanese Navy's counterpart to the Ki-43. [...] Both aircraft had generally similar layout and lines, and also used essentially the same Nakajima Sakae radial engine, with similar round cowlings and bubble-type canopies (the Oscars being distinctly smaller and having much less framing than the A6M). While relatively easy for a trained eye to tell apart with the [...] "finer" [...] lines of the Ki-43's fuselage — especially towards the tail — and more tapered wing planform; {{in the heat of}} battle, given the brief glimpses and distraction of combat, Allied aviators frequently made mistakes in enemy <b>aircraft</b> <b>identification</b> in the heat of a dogfight, reportedly having fought [...] "Zeros" [...] in areas where there were no Navy fighters.|$|E
2500|$|Avro Avian 594 Avian III (SN R3/AV/101) {{was owned}} by Lady Mary Heath and Amelia Earhart. Earhart's Avian had an [...] Cirrus Mk II engine. It was {{originally}} registered to Lady Heath on 29 October 1927 and given the UK aircraft marking G-EBUG. When Earhart {{brought it to the}} United States it was assigned [...] "unlicensed <b>aircraft</b> <b>identification</b> mark" [...] 7083; aircraft not officially certificated in the United States were allowed to be flown as unlicensed but identified aircraft. Avian 7083 was used on Earhart's first long solo flight, which occurred just as Amelia was coming into the national spotlight. By making the trip in August 1928, she became the first woman to fly solo across the North American continent and back. In 2001 Carlene Mendita recreated this flight in Greg Herrick's Type 594 Avian which he had purchased from Lang Kidby. At the time Herrick purchased the Avian from Kidby, two years prior, it was the oldest flying aircraft in Australia. It is now based in Minneapolis, Minnesota.|$|E

In lieu of working detection equipment and trained personnel, the Warning Service maintained a primitive system of 509 observation posts manned by 860 civilian watchers, unschooled in <b>aircraft</b> <b>identification,</b> who would report airplane movements by five radio, two telegraph, and ten telephone networks manned by members of all three U.S. military services, the Philippine Army and constabulary, the Philippine postal system, and civilian companies in the provinces.

40|$|A novel {{method for}} <b>aircraft</b> system <b>identification</b> is {{presented}} {{that is based}} on a new multivariate spline type; the multivariate multiplex B-spline. The multivariate multiplex B-spline is a generalization of the recently introduced tensor-simplex B-spline. Multivariate multiplex splines obtain similar or better approximation accuracy using less parameters (B-coefficients) than standard multivariate simplex B-splines which are currently used for <b>aircraft</b> system <b>identification.</b> The multiplex spline allows the user to incorporate a-priori knowledge of the modelled system in the definition of the model structure. In particular, while the standard simplex B-splines use a multi-dimensional triangulation in which all dimensions are coupled, the multiplex spline enables the user to decouple specific model dimensions based on expert knowledge of the system. The new method is used to approximate a 4 -dimensional nonlinear quadrotor inflow dataset. The results show that the multiplex B-spline obtains a relative root mean square error of 0. 672 % using 1440 B-coefficients. This compares favorably to results obtained with the standard 4 -dimensional simplex B-spline on the same dataset, which resulted in an relative root mean square error of 1. 608 % using 1540 B-coefficients.
