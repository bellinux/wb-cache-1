5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) unwell and horribly {{discolored}} in hospital. His veins are a sickly purple hue and are pulsating ominously. Suddenly, {{he goes into}} cardiac arrest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> pronounce him dead.|$|E
5|$|Nine days later, {{he checked}} into Methodist Hospital in Houston {{for a series}} of {{physical}} and psychological tests to determine the cause of his mysterious arm problems. An angiogram revealed an obstruction in the distal subclavian and axillary arteries of the right arm. Richard's blood pressure in his left arm was normal but pressure was nearly absent in his right arm due to the completely obstructed artery. On July 25, however, the arteries in his neck were studied, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> reached a conclusion that all was normal and no surgical treatment needed to be performed.|$|E
5|$|Several drivers {{stopped and}} rushed to the scene. John Watson and Derek Warwick pulled Villeneuve, his face blue, from the catch fence. The first doctor arrived within 35seconds to find that Villeneuve was not breathing, {{although}} his pulse continued; he was intubated and ventilated before being transferred to the circuit medical centre and then by helicopter to University St Raphael Hospital in Leuven where a fatal fracture of the neck was diagnosed. Villeneuve was kept alive on life support while his wife travelled to the hospital <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> consulted specialists worldwide. He died at 21:12 CEST (UTC+2).|$|E

They drove all night from New York to Boston, with police escorts provided to their convoy in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. When they arrived, the child was still unconscious <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> said all that could be done was wait to see if she woke up. The little girl never regained consciousness, and succumbed to her injuries.|$|E
25|$|In 1946 – {{in failing}} health and {{suffering}} from eczema over his entire body, he {{was transferred to}} the Capuchin novitiate of Saint Felix in Huntington, Indiana, where he lived until a 1956 hospitalization in Detroit. In 1957, he {{was rushed to the hospital}} for food poisoning, and upon his release, friars noted that he was walking much slower and scratching at his legs; it turned out that his skin was raw and infected, prompting a return to the hospital. The doctors diagnosed him with erysipelas or psoriasis, which was beyond treatment, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> considered amputation until the ulcers began to heal.|$|E

25|$|Rivière quickly {{passed the}} blame for his fall and his broken back on the team {{mechanic}}, accusing him of leaving oil on the wheels and the brakes for not working. The mechanic was outraged, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> soon found the real reason – that so much painkiller was in Rivière's blood that his hands were too slow to operate the brakes. He had taken {{a heavy dose of}} the opioid painkiller dextromoramide (Palfium), to help him stay with Nencini on Col de Perjuret. Rivière later admitted to being a drug addict, telling a newspaper how he had doped to beat the world hour record, and admitted downing thousands of tablets a year.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, {{with his}} boys grown {{and his wife}} {{spending}} six months of each year in Israel, Hambro moved to Florida {{to be close to}} his sister and other relatives, renting a Las Vistas apartment near the Inverrary Country Club in Fort Lauderdale (Fort Lauderhill). He taught private lessons, played in a variety of bands, both big and small, in Miami-Fort Lauderdale area jazz clubs, and continued to work as a booking agent. He also continued to readily donate his talents to charity fund raisers, most notably working with Jack Simpson to benefit the Brevard County Food Bank. However, suffering from severe chest pains, and told that he would need bypass surgery and a heart valve replacement, Hambro returned to New Jersey in early 1995 to be close to his sons, his wife, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> with whom he was comfortable; and to work on Chico O'Farrill's comeback album.|$|E

25|$|In {{the later}} {{years of his}} life Gallagher {{developed}} a phobia of flying. To overcome this he received a prescription for a powerful sedative. This medication, combined with his alcohol use resulted in severe liver damage. Despite this he continued touring. By the time of his final performance on 10 January 1995 in the Netherlands, he was visibly ill and the tour had to be cancelled. Gallagher was admitted to King's College Hospital in London in March 1995, and it was only then that the extent of his ill-health became apparent: his liver was failing <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> determined that in spite of his young age a liver transplant was the only possible course of action. After 13 weeks in intensive care, while waiting to be transferred to a convalescent home, his health suddenly worsened when he contracted a staphylococcal (MRSA) infection, and he died on 14 June 1995, at the age of 47. He was unmarried and had no children.|$|E
25|$|Born in {{the small}} {{northern}} Manitoban mining town of Flin Flon, Clarke began playing organized hockey when he was eight years old. Around {{the time he was}} 12 or 13 years old, he learned he had type 1 diabetes. Even though he progressed into a highly touted prospect playing for the Flin Flon Bombers, leading the league in which the Bombers played in scoring in each of his last three years of junior hockey, NHL teams feared Clarke {{would never be able to}} play in the NHL because of his diabetes. Bombers coach Pat Ginnell took Clarke to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota following the 1967–68 season <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> concluded that as long as he took care of himself he could play professionally. Ginnell asked the doctors to write that statement down and when NHL scouts came to watch the Bombers play during the 1968–69 season, Ginnell showed them the doctor's verdict.|$|E
25|$|Castro {{was sent}} to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The top half of his right index finger was ripped off <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> had to amputate the {{remaining}} part of the finger. His right eye was blown out and he had a metal fragment in his left eye. The extent of his injuries was such that doctors doubted whether Castro would survive the week. When Castro regained consciousness days later, his right eye was gone, but doctors hoped to salvage the vision in his left. The surgeons later removed one last piece of shrapnel from that eye. When they took off his bandages they flashed a light for Castro to see; however, when he did not respond to the light, he was told that he would never see again. Castro remained in the hospital for two months after his injury, with no idea of what he would do next. He then overheard a doctor and a nurse discussing the next Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon. He asked his doctor if the courses were flat or hilly, then made running both races his goal.|$|E

500|$|Upon further investigation, Francis {{is shocked}} to learn that Dr. Caligari is the asylum's {{director}}. With help from the asylum staff, Francis studies the director's records and diary while the director is sleeping. The writings reveal his obsession {{with the story of}} an 18th-century mystic named Caligari, who used a somnambulist named Cesare to commit murders in northern Italian towns.

However, the donor was said to be concerned that [...] "his penis is shrinking as he gets older and he is worried it might not make a proper exhibit." [...] His penis was given priority over those of the non-Icelandic donors in accordance with the museum's mission to display the organs of Icelandic mammals. Removing and preserving it was not an easy proposition, as Sigurður explained: [...] "The donor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> are in agreement, it must be taken while the body is warm.

500|$|Following the hoax, {{the medical}} profession's gullibility became {{the target of}} a great deal of public mockery. [...] William Hogarth {{published}} Cunicularii, or The Wise Men of Godliman in Consultation (1726), which portrays Toft in the throes of labour, surrounded by the tale's chief participants. [...] Figure [...] "F" [...] is Toft, [...] "E" [...] is her husband. [...] "A" [...] is St.André, and [...] "D" [...] is Howard. [...] In Dennis Todd's Three Characters in Hogarth's Cunicularii and Some Implications the author concludes that figure [...] "G" [...] is Mary Toft's sister-in-law, Margaret Toft. [...] Toft's confession of 7December demonstrates her insistence that her sister-in-law played no part in the hoax, but Manningham's 1726 An Exact Diary of what was observ'd during a Close Attendance upon Mary Toft, the pretended Rabbet-Breeder of Godalming in Surrey offers eyewitness testimony of her complicity.
