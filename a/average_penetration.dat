40|$|Displacement effects {{induced by}} {{low-energy}} ion irradiation in silicon {{have been investigated}} theoretically. Instantaneous energy of an incident ion during its slowing-down process has been obtained {{as a function of}} the penetration depth and the ordinal number of displacement collisions by solving a set of integral equations.

The mean free path of the incident ion at a specific depth in silicon is also estimated for several initial energy values and ion species. The energy transfer rate into atomic displacement collisions and the density of deposited energy in a collision cascade have been evaluated considering the primary knock-on process. The damaged layer thickness obtained by the experiment of the ion-bombardment-enhanced selective etching of silicon crystals shows a good agreement with the depth where the estimated density of deposited energy takes a constant value...|$|R

Income {{was found to be}} the single most influential factor in predicting the presence of a telephone in the home, although strong mitigating factors were also identified. Low penetration rates were found among women single heads of households. Low rates were also found among the two minorities studied in comparison with the white majority, even when controlled for income. Finally, the elderly, once thought to suffer from isolation, were found to enjoy higher than <b>average</b> telephone <b>penetration</b> rates. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of lingering questions and proposes considerations for policies that might lead to higher levels of participation. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{energy of}} the ions, {{as well as the}} ion species and the {{composition}} of the target determine the depth of penetration of the ions in the solid: A monoenergetic ion beam will generally have a broad depth distribution. The <b>average</b> <b>penetration</b> depth is called the range of the ions. Under typical circumstances ion ranges will be between 10 nanometers and 1 micrometer. Thus, ion implantation is especially useful in cases where the chemical or structural change is desired to be near the surface of the target. Ions gradually lose their energy as they travel through the solid, both from occasional collisions with target atoms (which cause abrupt energy transfers) and from a mild drag from overlap of electron orbitals, which is a continuous process. The loss of ion energy in the target is called stopping and can be simulated with the binary collision approximation method.|$|E

40|$|Polyethylene wear {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} causes of failure of total knee replacements (TKRs). Currently, wear can only be accurately measured by retrieval studies. There is a need for a method to measure wear accurately in vivo. We have developed a Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) system that can measure penetration of the metallic femoral component into the polyethylene of the tibia. We have used this system to study six AGC TKRs at 6 years postoperatively and six control AGC TKRs at 2 weeks postoperatively. The mean difference between the RSA measured bearing thickness and the manufacturer's quoted values for the control group was - 0. 03 mm (S. D. 0. 17). The <b>average</b> linear <b>penetration</b> in the study group was 0. 8 mm (S. D. 0. 46). This was significantly (P< 0. 0001) different from the control group. The <b>average</b> linear <b>penetration</b> rate was 0. 13 mm per year (S. D. 0. 08). We would expect the penetration to deepen with time. In young active patients, this could be a cause for concern, particularly with a thin bearing. The current system is accurate enough to measure wear at 5 years post TKR. It has the potential for predicting long-term wear problems with new designs of TKR and new materials within 2 years...|$|R

50|$|Patented by Charles A. Seely, {{this process}} {{achieves}} treatment by immersing seasoned wood in successive baths of {{hot and cold}} preservatives. During the hot baths, the air expands in the timbers. When the timbers are changed to the cold bath (the preservative can also be changed) a partial vacuum is created within the lumen of the cells, causing the preservative {{to be drawn into}} the wood. Some penetration occurs during the hot baths, but most of it takes place during the cold baths. This cycle is repeated with a significant time reduction compared to other steeping processes. Each bath may last 4 to 8 hours or in some cases longer. The temperature of the preservative in the hot bath should be between 60 to 110 C and 30 to 40 C in the cold bath (depending on preservative and tree species). The <b>average</b> <b>penetration</b> depths achieved with this process ranges from 30 to 50 mm. Both preservative oils and water-soluble salts can be used with this treatment. Due to the longer treatment periods, this method finds little use in the commercial wood preservation industry today.|$|E
50|$|Computerised {{simulations}} {{can readily}} incorporate {{chance in the}} form of some sort of randomised element, and can be run many times to provide outcomes in terms of probabilities. In such situations, it sometimes happens that the unusual results are of more interest than the expected ones. For example, if a simulation modelling an invasion of nation A by nation B was put through one hundred iterations to determine the likely depth of penetration into A's territory by B's forces after four weeks, an average result could be calculated. Examining those results, it might be found that the <b>average</b> <b>penetration</b> was around fifty kilometres—however, there would also be outlying results on the ends of the probability curve. At one end, {{it could be that the}} FEBA is found to have hardly moved at all; at the other, penetration could be hundreds of kilometres instead of tens. The analyst would then examine these outliers to determine why this was the case. In the first instance, it might be found that the computer model's random number generator had delivered results such that A's divisional artillery was much more effective than normal. In the second, it might be that the model generated a spell of particularly bad weather that kept A's air force grounded. This analysis can then be used to make recommendations: perhaps to look at ways in which artillery can be made more effective, or to invest in more all-weather fighter and ground-attack aircraft.|$|E
