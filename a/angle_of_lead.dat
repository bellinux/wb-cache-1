The results of theoretical investigations on conical-helical agitator-bridge breaking cone of mineral fertilizers have made it possible to establish interdependence of the motion path of an elementary volume of mineral fertilizers along helical spiral coil of the agitator and its relative speed on functional and technological parameters such as cone-generating angle to its axis,  an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead,</b> a radius of helical surface, coefficients of external and internal friction and an angular velocity.

The construction stages are calculation, development of blanks, development of tooth rims and involute gears. The involute meshing is formed in the normal as related to a tooth curve plane using equivalent wheels and making involutes according to parametric equations. The closed region of a tooth contour is pressed out along the trajectory, a helix with an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> equal to the helix angle is used in such capacity. Then the tooth is distributed following the Circular Sketch Pattern along a blank, forming a rim of the wheel. The gear assembly is carried out {{with the help of}} a layout sketch. The teeth are matched with gashes by using a pitch point and cutting the teeth by a plane which is perpendicular to a transmission axis. The accuracy of a gear model is analyzed by clearance measuring, interference, parameters of rims, and sizing of contact patterns.

40|$|It is {{established}} that the lead and back angles of teeth, angle of helical flutes available require for correcting a thread profile of milling cutter teeth to machine a thread with an appropriate degree of accuracy. Based on the previously developed geometrical model an experiment is conducted to calculate the values of tooth profile angles of thread milling cutters with helical flutes at variation of five factors in the established factorial space. When planning the experiment the full central composite draft has been elaborated in the coded form for five factors at three levels {{taking into account the}} orthogonality and the impossibility to conduct repeatedly experiments in the chosen points. As the conducted researches have shown that a nature of dependence of the tooth profile angle values on design and geometrical parameters of thread milling cutter is nonlinear, the second degree of an approximating polynom is accepted. As a consequence, to assess all the coefficients of the polynom of the second degree the factors have been varied at three levels. Based on the method of planning the mathematical models are developed to calculate the tooth profile angles of thread milling cutter with helical flutes allowing to obtain the values of angles depending on a pitch of thread, a cutter diameter, a rake angle, an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> of helical flutes, and a back angle. In terms of making manual calculations the obtained polynoms are cumbersome, however when using the model in CAD systems of thread milling cutters {{there is no need to}} simplify it.

40|$|For {{repairing}} opaque defects on x-ray masks by focused gallium ion beams (Ga+-FIB), it {{is important}} to achieve nearly vertical slopes in the remaining absorber material and to avoid the redeposition of sputtered particles. The sputter yield depends on the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> incidence. Since this angular dependence influences the slope angle, the sputter yield of a 100 keV focused Ga+ ion beam on polycrystalline gold, as used on x-ray masks, was measured at five different <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> incidence (Theta = 0 degree, 30 degree, 45 degree, 60 degree, 80 degree). At normal incidence (Theta = 0 degree) the yield is 32. It increases with increasing <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> incidence and becomes 128 at Theta = 80 degree. By means of computer simulations it could be shown, that the sputter yield at great <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> incidence plays the predominant role for the evolution of the slope, even if the repair process is carried out with nominally vertical incidence. A high sputter yield at a great <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> incidence <b>leads</b> to a precip itous slope (Alpha = 85 degree). An even better slope angle was achieved when the beam was scanned in an appropriate manner: If the center of the beam, where the ion current density is maximum (Gaussian beam shape), is directed onto the lower parts of the slope, there, an increased sputter erosion takes place. The reason is not only the increased ion current density, but the higher sputter yield at great <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> incidence as well. Experimentally and in a computer simulation it could be shown that a slope <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> Alpha = 88 degree can be achieved in forward direction (direction of scanning). Since redeposition affects the microstructuring of gold substantially, the redeposition characteristics (spatial distributions of sputtered particles) were measured for two <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> incidence (Theta = 0 degree, 45 degree).

40|$|The {{symmetry}} {{of the problem}} of the apparent deficit in upward-going atmospheric muon neutrinos reveals two possible, nonexclusive kinds of solution: Nonlinearity in distance or nonlinearity in <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> observation. Nonlinearity in distance leads to the most popular theory for the atmospheric problem, neutrino flavor oscillations. If the observed deficit is caused by oscillations and not, say, flavor-changing or other weak-force scattering, neutrinos must be massive. But, if flavor oscillations occur in vacuum, all oscillating neutrinos must have exactly equal mass. Theories of oscillation in matter such as the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect do not work in vacuum. This is the conceptual conflict of kinematics versus vacuum oscillations. Flavor-changing oscillations like those of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark theory become possible in vacuum if freely propagating neutrinos may be associated with local substructure. Nonlinearity in <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> observation <b>leads</b> to a simple prediction of an excess of horizontal muon flavor.

Motivated by our interest in micro air vehicles (MAVs), we utilize a Navier-Stokes equation solver to investigate the aerodynamics of a flapping airfoil.

For a symmetric plunging airfoil NACA 0012 at zero geometric <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack and chord Reynolds number of 2 × 10 4, at the same plunging frequency, it can produce either drag or thrust depending on the plunging amplitude. At the considered plunging amplitude (from 0. 0125 c to 0. 075 c), the flow history has more influence than the kinematic <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack to determine the lift.
