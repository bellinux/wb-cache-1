40|$|Despite CAP reform driven price {{reductions}} and BSE and FMD induced price {{declines in the}} beef sector, EU real agricultural income per worker rose by an estimated 3. 3 % in 2001. This increase was due {{to an increase in}} real agricultural income (+ 1. 2 %) on the one hand, and a continued reduction in the volume of <b>agricultural</b> <b>labour</b> <b>input</b> (- 2. 0 %) on the other. Real agricultural incomes were up in all member states except Luxembourg with the strongest growth rates in Denmark (+ 12. 3 %), Portugal (+ 11. 8 %), Austria (+ 10. 9 %), Germany (+ 9. 9 %), Ireland (+ 7. 8 %) and Belgium (+ 5. 3 %). Comment: Clearly CAP reform involving substantial price reductions does not mean poorer EU farmers.

40|$|Contrary to {{what was}} {{expected}} {{at the beginning of}} the transformation, semisubsistence farm households (SFHs) have persevered. There is an ongoing debate about what could prompt SFHs to become more profitable or to exit farming. A number of policy measures within the Common Agricultural Policy address this issue. This contribution assesses the impact of selected EU rural development measures on SFHs in Poland. Under the heading of multiple criteria decision-making, different approaches have been discussed in the literature. In this contribution, a multiobjective linear programming household model using compromise programming is applied. Four household objectives are optimised simultaneously: net agricultural production, net non-farm income, and household cash balance are maximised, while <b>agricultural</b> <b>labour</b> <b>input</b> is minimised. All together, four representative SFH types were simulated. Simulation results show that fine-targeting of policy measures to specific household situations is a strong precondition for successful development. The differing results between the multiobjective approach as compared to programming with one objective are also discussed.

At the same time, {{the phenomenon of}} surplus labour is well-documented for historical (as well as modern) pre-industrial societies. This study discusses the paradox of surplus labour in a Malthusian economy. Inspired {{by the work of}} Boserup (1965) and others, and in contrast to the Lewis (1954) approach, we suggest that the phenomenon of surplus labour is best understood through an acceptance of the importance of seasonality in agriculture. Boserup observed that the harvest season was invariably associated with labour shortages (the high-season bottleneck on production), although there might be labour surplus during the low season. We introduce the concept of seasonality into a stylized Malthusian model, and endogenize the extent of <b>agricultural</b> <b>labour</b> <b>input,</b> which is then used to calculate labour surplus and the rate of labour productivity.

50|$|But the {{production}} of any commodity generally requires both labour and some previously produced means of production (or capital goods), like tools and materials. The amount of labour so required is called the direct <b>labour</b> <b>input</b> into the commodity. Yet the required capital goods have in their turn been produced (in the past) by labour and other capital goods; and so on for these other capital goods, and so on. The sum of all the amounts of labour, that were direct inputs into this backwards-stretching series of capital goods produced in the past, is called the indirect <b>labour</b> <b>input</b> into the commodity. Putting together the direct and indirect <b>labour</b> <b>inputs,</b> one finally gets the total <b>labour</b> <b>input</b> into the commodity, which may also be called the total embodied labour in it, or its direct and indirect labour contents.|$|R

Based on a measure of sectoral labour adjustment, the paper explores the determinants of occupational labour flows paying {{special attention to the}} impact of institutions. Annual rates of occupational migration between agriculture and non-agriculture over the period 1978 - 2005 are calculated for a panel of 30 transition countries. Annual migration from agriculture ranges from outflows of nearly 8 percent of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>labour</b> force to immigration into agriculture about 9 percent on average. Fixed-effects panel models are used to explain the annual intersectoral labour flow. The most important determinants of the migration rate are the relative income differences between non-agricultural and agricultural sectors, the relative magnitude of <b>agricultural</b> <b>labour,</b> the development of terms of trade and the level of unemployment. Furthermore, the speed of economic reforms and the way of land privatization affect occupational migration significantly. An increasing intersectoral income difference points to still existing mobility restrictions for <b>agricultural</b> <b>labour</b> in some of the countries analyzed...|$|R
