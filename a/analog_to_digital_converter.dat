25|$|A {{voltmeter}} is {{an instrument}} used for measuring {{electrical potential difference}} between two points in an electric circuit. Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale {{in proportion to the}} voltage of the circuit; digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by use of an <b>analog</b> <b>to</b> <b>digital</b> <b>converter.</b> The digital voltmeter was invented in 1953 by Andrew Kay, founder of Kaypro.|$|E
25|$|In analog instruments, the {{bandwidth}} of the oscilloscope {{is limited}} by the vertical amplifiers and the CRT or other display subsystem. In digital instruments, the sampling rate of the <b>analog</b> <b>to</b> <b>digital</b> <b>converter</b> (ADC) is a factor, but the stated analog bandwidth (and therefore the overall bandwidth of the instrument) is usually less than the ADC's Nyquist frequency. This is due to limitations in the analog signal amplifier, deliberate design of the Anti-aliasing filter that precedes the ADC, or both.|$|E

25|$|A {{dedicated}} {{voltage comparator}} chip such as LM339 {{is designed to}} interface with a digital logic interface (to a TTL or a CMOS). The output is a binary state often used to interface real world signals to digital circuitry (see <b>analog</b> <b>to</b> <b>digital</b> <b>converter).</b> If there is a fixed voltage source from, for example, a DC adjustable device in the signal path, a comparator is just {{the equivalent of a}} cascade of amplifiers. When the voltages are nearly equal, the output voltage will not fall into one of the logic levels, thus analog signals will enter the digital domain with unpredictable results. To make this range as small as possible, the amplifier cascade is high gain. The circuit consists of mainly Bipolar transistors. For very high frequencies, the input impedance of the stages is low. This reduces the saturation of the slow, large P-N junction bipolar transistors that would otherwise lead to long recovery times. Fast small Schottky diodes, like those found in binary logic designs, improve the performance significantly though the performance still lags that of circuits with amplifiers using analog signals. Slew rate has no meaning for these devices. For applications in flash ADCs the distributed signal across eight ports matches the voltage and current gain after each amplifier, and resistors then behave as level-shifters.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} developing efficient sampling schemes for multiband sparse signals.

In this paper we propose an alternative multirate synchronous implementation of multicoset codes, that is, all the <b>analog</b> <b>to</b> <b>digital</b> <b>converters</b> in the sampling scheme operate at different sampling frequencies, without need of introducing any delay. The interleaving is achieved through the usage of different rates, whose sum is significantly lower than the Nyquist rate of the multiband signal. To obtain universal patterns the sampling matrix is formulated and analyzed. Appropriate choices of the parameters, that is the block length and the sampling rates, are also proposed...|$|R
