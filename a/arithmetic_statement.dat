To German theorists of the [...] "crisis", the Pythagorean diagonal of the square was similar in its impact to Cantor's diagonalization method of generating higher order infinities, and Gödel's diagonalization method in Gödel's proof of incompleteness of formalized arithmetic. Becker, like several earlier historians, suggests that the avoidance of <b>arithmetic</b> <b>statement</b> of geometrical magnitude in Euclid is avoided for ratios and proportions, as a consequence of recoil from the shock of incommensurability. Becker also showed that all the theorems of Euclidean proportion theory could be proved using an earlier alternative to the Eudoxus technique which Becker found stated in Aristotle's Topics, and which Becker attributes to Theaetetus. Becker also showed how a constructive logic that denied unrestricted excluded middle could be used to reconstruct most of Euclid's proofs.|$|E

40|$|Insight {{problems}} are problems {{where the problem}} solver struggles {{to find a solution}} until * aha! * the solution suddenly appears. Two contemporary theories suggest that insight {{problems are}} difficult either because problem solvers begin with an incorrect representation of the problem, or that problem solvers apply inappropriate heuristics to the problem. The relative contributions of representational change and inappropriate heuristics on the process of insight problem solving was studied with a task that required the problem solver to move two matchsticks in order to transform an incorrect <b>arithmetic</b> <b>statement</b> into a correct one. Problem solvers (N = 120) worked on two different types of two-move matchstick arithmetic problems that both varied with respect to the effectiveness of heuristics and to the degree of a necessary representational change of the problem representation. A strong influence of representational change on solution rates was found whereas the influence of heuristics had minimal effects on solution rates. That is, the difficulty of insight problems within the two-move matchstick arithmetic domain is governed by the degree of representational change required. A model is presented that details representational change as the necessary condition for ensuring that appropriate heuristics can be applied on the proper problem representation...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part we recall the theory of multiprojective {{elimination}} initiated by P. Philippon and developed by G. Rémond. In particular, we define the eliminant ideal, the resultant forms and the Hilbert-Samuel polynomial for multigraded modules. We then look at subvarieties and cycles of a product of projective spaces, over a number field, and we define their mixed degrees and mixed heights, which measure respectively their geometric and arithmetic complexity. Finally, we define the heights of multiprojective cycles relative to some sets of polynomials, generalizing a previous notion of height due to M. Laurent and D. Roy, and we give detailed proofs for their properties. In the second part we prove that {{if we have a}} sequence of polynomials with bounded degrees and bounded integer coefficients taking small values at a pair (a,b) together with their first derivatives, then both a and b need to be algebraic. The main ingredients of the proof include a translation of the problem in multihomogeneous setting, an interpolation result, the construction of a 0 -dimensional variety with small height, a result for the multiplicity of resultant forms, and a final descent.

40|$|We analyse {{the extent}} of {{possible}} computations following Hogarth [7] in Malament-Hogarth (MH) spacetimes, and Etesi and Németi [3] in the special subclass containing rotating Kerr black holes. [7] had shown that any <b>arithmetic</b> <b>statement</b> could be resolved in a suitable MH spacetime. [3] had shown that some ∀ ∃ relations on natural numbers which are neither universal nor co-universal, can be decided in Kerr spacetimes, and had asked specifically as to {{the extent of}} computational limits there. The purpose of this note is to address this question, and further show that MH spacetimes can compute far beyond the arithmetic: effectively Borel statements (so hyperarithmetic in second order number theory, or the structure of analysis) can likewise be resolved: Theorem A. If H is any hyperarithmetic predicate on integers, then there is an MH spacetime in which any query?n ∈ H? can be computed. In one sense this is best possible, as there is an upper bound to computational ability in any spacetime which is thus a universal constant of the space-time M. Theorem C. Assuming the (modest and standard) requirement that space-time manifolds be paracompact and Hausdorff, for any MH spacetime M there will be a countable ordinal upper bound, w(M), on the complexity of questions in the Borel hierarchy resolvable in it. ...|$|E

40|$|Let H be ` 2 (over C) and let B(H) {{denote the}} C*-algebra of all bounded {{operators}} on H. Fix an orthonormal basis (en) for H. The atomic masa corresponding to this basis is `∞; equivalently, the algebra of all operators that are diagonalized by the basis (en). The projections in ` ∞ {{are exactly the}} projections onto subspaces spanned by a subset of {en}. That is, P(`∞) ∼= P(N) (here P(A) denotes the set of all projections in a C*-algebra A). In particular, if we fix a basis, then the Boolean algebra P(N) is naturally a sublattice of P(B(H)). Given X ⊆ N, we write P (~e) X for the projection onto span{en: n ∈ X}. The following problem and conjecture appear to be very similar at the first sight. Problem 0. 1 (Kadison–Singer, 1959 [15]). Assume φ is a pure state on the atomic masa in B(H). Does φ have a unique extension to a pure state of B(H) ? Conjecture 0. 2 (Kadison–Singer, 1959 [15]). For every pure state ϕ of B(H) there is a masa A such that ϕA is multiplicative. In case when φ is a vector state ωξ(a) = (aξ|ξ) then Problem 0. 1 has a positive answer since by Lemma 2. 3 any extension ψ must satisfy ψ(a) = (aξ|ξ). The conjecture is trivially true in case when φ is a vector state. We may therefore assume that the states are singular, mod out the com-pact operators, {{and work in the}} Calkin algebra Q(H) = B(H) /K(H). At the first sight, these problems are about ultrafilters on N and even more complicated analogous objects on B(H). Indeed, some of the early research was trying to attack Kadison–Singer problem as a problem about ultrafilters. For example, in 1971 Reid ([20]) proved that for pure states diagonalized by certain specific type of ultrafilters the answer to Problem 0. 1. However, for quarter of a century it was known that a positive answer to the Kadison–Singer problem is equivalent to an <b>arithmetic</b> <b>statement,</b> an...|$|E

Along the way, we also prove modularity of certain elliptic curves that are semistable at all v | 3.
