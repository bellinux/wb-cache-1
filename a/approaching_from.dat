5|$|Between 4:45 and 5:00 pm, {{a number}} of people in the area of Winona, Minnesota, were observing a {{thunderstorm}} <b>approaching</b> <b>from</b> the northwest. These people told the Civil Aeronautics Board that the storm was increasing in intensity, and they observed increasing amounts of thunder and lightning. The aircraft continued on course in the direction of Winona, where it encountered the thunderstorm. The aircraft was seen flying below the clouds before entering the roll cloud, or leading edge of the thunderstorm. This was the last reported sighting of the aircraft; seconds later, local observers saw pieces of the aircraft falling from the sky.|$|E
5|$|The Habsburg center columns {{included}} 17,000men {{under the}} command of field marshal Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, formed into three columns and <b>approaching</b> <b>from</b> the north east. The main force, {{under the command}} of the Archduke Charles, included 53,000men, also in three columns; in the main force, Charles had under his command the princes of Anhalt and Fürstenberg plus six battalions in a fourth column, north of the main column, but south of Nauendorf's command. An additional force of 13,000troops {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Field Marshal Anton Count Sztáray formed the southern flank.|$|E

5|$|The Scandinavian {{trade routes}} were equally {{important}} for the Batavian Navy, and to protect their merchant shipping from attack by British frigates, the Batavian authorities also sent a frigate squadron to the region, consisting of the 36-gun frigates Alliantie and Argo and the 16-gun cutter Vlugheid. On the afternoon of 22 August 1795 the Batavian force was sailing southeast {{along the coast of}} Norway, then part of Danish Norway, tacking to port towards the land, when the British squadron was spotted <b>approaching</b> <b>from</b> the south.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{official}} {{tropical cyclone}} {{of the year}} was also previously unknown until contemporary reassessments. It exhibited some hybrid characteristics, and may have qualified for subtropical cyclone status according to the modern classification scheme. On September 15, the storm formed over the central Atlantic and initially moved westward. It gradually intensified as it turned northwestward, and on September 19 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone southeast of New England. The system was subsequently absorbed by a more powerful frontal boundary <b>approaching</b> <b>from</b> the northwest.|$|E
5|$|Townshend {{took charge}} of the British forces and {{realised}} that Bougainville's column was <b>approaching</b> <b>from</b> the British rear, having taken some time to arrive from Cap Rouge. He quickly formed up two battalions from the confused troops on the field and turned them to meet the oncoming French, a day-saving manoeuvre; instead of attacking with a well rested and ready force, Bougainville retreated while the rest of Montcalm's army slipped back across the St. Charles.|$|E

5|$|A British {{squadron}} of four frigates {{under the command}} of Captain James Alms was patrolling the entrance to the Skagerrak in August 1795 when three sails were spotted off the Norwegian coast to the north. Closing to investigate, the ships were discovered to be a Batavian {{squadron of}} two frigates and a small cutter. In the face of the larger British squadron the Batavian force turned away, sailing southeast along the Norwegian coast with the British <b>approaching</b> <b>from</b> the south in an effort to cut them off from the neutral Danish shore. At 16:15 the leading British ship HMS Stag caught and engaged the rearmost Batavian ship Alliantie; the remainder of the British squadron continued in pursuit of the Batavian squadron. For an hour Alliantie held out against the more powerful Stag and was eventually compelled to surrender. The remainder of the Batavian squadron escaped due to a fierce rearguard action by the frigate Argo, reaching the safety of the Danish harbour at Eigerøya.|$|E
5|$|At 15:00, {{with the}} {{detached}} division rapidly <b>approaching</b> <b>from</b> astern, Hallowell turned his ship towards the ships sailing ahead of Swiftsure {{and attempted to}} pass across {{the stern of the}} rearmost ship in an effort to rake and disable it, creating enough confusion to mask an escape. The manoeuvere was recognised by the French captains, and all three vessels turned to face the British ship as it approached. By 15:30 the ships of the line had opened a mutual fire, during which the faster French warships were able to easily outmanoeuvere the lumbering Swiftsure. At 16:37, after more than an hour of fruitless firing at long range, the arrival of Jean Bart and Constitution within gunshot convinced Hallowell that further resistance was hopeless and he struck his flag to signal his surrender.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} damaged in the engagement, {{although}} Saumarez's damage was almost entirely confined to his rigging: very few shots had actually struck his hull during the battle, {{and the only}} one that provoked notice passed across the deck without causing injury and struck a cannon on the opposite site, setting it off {{in the direction of a}} number of small gunboats that were <b>approaching</b> <b>from</b> the shore. Casualties on Crescent were equally light, with just one man injured; he had been standing too close to his own cannon during the opening broadside and had been struck by the recoiling gun, suffering a broken leg. Damage and losses on the French ship were very severe, with the rigging in tatters, the hull and lower masts repeatedly struck and casualties that Saumarez initially estimated at more than 120 men killed or wounded, although French accounts give the lower figure of 33 killed and 48 wounded.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} French lookouts at Santo Domingo had spotted Duckworth <b>{{approaching}}</b> <b>from</b> the southeast, {{it was too}} late for Leissègues to escape. Sailing with the wind westwards along the coast, Leissègues formed a line of battle to meet the approaching British squadron, which had split into two divisions. Although his divisions separated during the approach, Duckworth's lead ships remained in a tight formation and successfully engaged the head of the French line, targeting the flagship Impérial. Under pressure, the French squadron broke apart with the British isolating and capturing three ships before concentrating on the main combat around the French flagship. Severely damaged and surrounded, Leissègues drove Impérial ashore to avoid capture. The remaining French ship of the line, Diomède, followed him. Although most of the crew of these ships scrambled ashore, British boarding parties captured both vessels and set them on fire. The only French ships to escape the battle were three smaller warships, which Duckworth's squadron had ignored; they eventually returned to France.|$|E
5|$|Fought at the {{junction}} of the east-west and north-south roads {{on the eastern side}} of the Black Forest, the day-long battle at Stockach and Engen pitted the two armies against each other for the second time in seven days. The Austrians still had the numerical superiority, but this time it was closer to two-to-one, instead of almost three-to-one. Jourdan had consolidated his force over a shorter line, and had the full Army of the Danube under his direct command. Charles, likewise, had shortened his line; although Hotze had not yet caught up with the archduke, he and his 10,000men were <b>approaching</b> <b>from</b> the Austrians' left rear.|$|E
5|$|Later on August6, the {{weakening}} trend briefly halted as outflow significantly improved {{due to an}} {{area of low pressure}} north of Meranti. However, wind shear drastically increased, displacing convection to the northwest of the circulation center. By this time, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition. Due to the influence of a major shortwave trough <b>approaching</b> <b>from</b> the west, Meranti took a sharp northward turn. The JTWC issued their final advisory on {{the weakening}} cyclone around 0600UTC on August8. The JMA continued to monitor Meranti as a tropical cyclone until August9. Shortly after becoming extratropical, the remnants of the storm executed a slow, counter-clockwise loop until August12. Shortly after crossing the International Date Line on August13, the storm was absorbed by a large non-tropical low over the Bering Sea.|$|E

In fact, the only other storm to take a similar track was Typhoon Mac in 1989, which also <b>approached</b> <b>from</b> the southeast and struck Japans Kantō region along its east coast.|$|R

5|$|Mid-way in the march, Frederick finally {{realized}} that he would end up facing his enemy, instead of <b>approaching</b> <b>from</b> behind. Furthermore, a row of ponds forced him to break his line into three narrow columns, exposing it to full Russian fire power. Frederick changed his dispositions; the Prussian right vanguard would concentrate east of the ponds of Kunersdorf and make {{an assault on the}} Mühlberge. Frederick calculated that he could turn the Austrian-Russian flank, and push the Russians off the Mühlberge heights. His redeployment took time, and the apparent hesitation in the assault confirmed to Saltykov what Frederick planned; he moved more troops around so that the strongest line would face the Prussian onslaught.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November Soviet forces {{began to}} cross the Don River and {{continued}} their advance towards the town of Kalach. German forces defending Kalach, mostly composed of maintenance and supply personnel, {{were not aware of}} the Soviet offensive until 21 November, and even then did not know in what strength the Red Army was approaching. The task of taking the bridge at Kalach was given to the Soviet 26th Tank Corps, which used two captured German tanks and a reconnaissance vehicle to approach it and fire on the guards. Soviet forces broke into the town by mid-morning and drove the defenders out, allowing themselves and the 4th Tank Corps to link up with the Red Army's 4th Mechanized Corps <b>approaching</b> <b>from</b> the south. The encirclement of German forces in Stalingrad was completed on 22 November 1942. That day Soviet formations also continued to fight pockets of Romanian resistance, such as that put up by the Romanian 5th Corps.|$|E
5|$|On 6 December the Australians {{attacked}} again, {{this time}} with two companies <b>approaching</b> <b>from</b> the north-east, using an intense artillery and mortar bombardment to prepare the area first; the attack was repulsed with heavy fire. A further barrage rained down on the Japanese and by sunset, the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion, severely depleted with most its companies– several of which were commanded by junior non commissioned officers due to heavy casualties amongst the subalterns– at platoon strength, had managed to establish a lodging {{near the top of}} the feature on its eastern approach. That night the Japanese fell back from the position and the following day the Australians occupied Christmas Hills.|$|E
