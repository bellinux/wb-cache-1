5|$|According to e-mails {{released}} in the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, Millionaire narrowly avoided cancellation after the 2014–15 season. The show's declining ratings prompted DADT to demand a dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal, which SPE was hesitant to accept. The series was nonetheless renewed for the 2015–16 season, with various cuts to the show's production budget <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the original format (but with only 14 questions). Had the show not been renewed, SPE would have placed the show on extended hiatus for three years, reclaimed full rights to the show (without the innovations and format added in the syndicated run, to which DADT owns intellectual property rights), and shopped the revived show to another network or syndicator. In January 2017, {{it was announced that}} Millionaire has been renewed through 2018.|$|E
5|$|By 5 May 1536, {{the town}} council of Buena Esperanza had now lost all faith in Cerezeda and {{voted for the}} {{abandonment}} of Higueras <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Trujillo; Cerezeda opposed this decision, but the council forced him {{to sign off on}} the move. In the meantime, any party foraging outside of Buena Esperanza was ordered to consist of at least 20 members for defence from the hostile natives. A chaotic evacuation back to Trujillo began, and resentment against Cerezeda was such that he feared for his life and fled to Naco to seek refuge amongst friendly natives there. On 9 May, amidst this disordered Spanish retreat, García de Celís returned from Guatemala with news that help would soon be forthcoming.|$|E

Further changes to shops were made in 2015, with the closure of Wimbledon and Birmingham New Street, the opening of The Rye Bookshop <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Welwyn Garden City.

5|$|Serving as Secretary of the Treasury in the {{administration}} of Rutherford B. Hayes, Sherman continued his efforts for financial stability and solvency, overseeing an end to wartime inflationary measures <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> gold-backed money. He returned to the Senate after his term expired, serving there for a further sixteen years. During that time he continued his work on financial legislation, as well as writing and debating laws on immigration, business competition law, and the regulation of interstate commerce. Sherman was the principal author of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which was signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison. In 1897, President William McKinley appointed him Secretary of State. Failing health and declining faculties made him unable to handle the burdens of the job, and he retired in 1898 {{at the start of the}} Spanish–American War. Sherman died at his home in Washington, D.C. in 1900.|$|E
5|$|The Third Division {{championship}} was {{won in the}} 1965–66 {{season and}} Hull remained in the Second Division for 12 years before relegation in 1978. Hull reached the semi-final of the Watney Cup in the tournament's inaugural staging in 1970, where they were beaten by Manchester United in a penalty shoot-out; {{this was the first}} game in English football to be decided by this method. The Final of this competition was reached in 1974, where Hull were beaten by Stoke City. Relegation to the Fourth Division {{for the first time in}} the club's history came in 1981 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the Third Division was secured two years later in the 1982–83 season. The season after, Hull reached the final of the Associate Members' Cup in its inaugural season and were beaten by Bournemouth. Promotion to the Second Division came the following season, although relegations in the 1990–91 and 1995–96 seasons saw the club return to the fourth tier.|$|E

25|$|In {{the event}} that some portion of the nucleus did survive, the {{eccentricity}} and inclination of Comet Lovejoy's orbit avoids significant perturbation from planets, which leaves {{the possibility that the}} comet may return for another perihelion.

25|$|The {{following}} {{few years}} saw mixed fortunes {{for the club}} on the field, with a sudden decline in 1968 and 1969 followed by a semi-final berth in 1970 (though they immediately bowed out by losing 12–7 to St George) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> mid-table in 1971 and 1972.

25|$|Appliance {{designs in}} the early 1950s were often austere and functional, but from 1955 they became more {{colorful}} and diverse, so the housewife could demonstrate her good taste in selecting items {{that would make the}} kitchen more welcoming and that would showcase the family's prosperity. By the late 1950s there was a return to cleaner designs without decorative moldings, with line and angle replacing rounded forms <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> white or neutral colors.|$|E

25|$|The {{best example}} of the {{emergence}} of a new style is in the contemporary coinage. The images of the Parthian kings are often highly stylized in the 1st century. Angular shapes replaced the round, flowing forms of the Greek style, at least more prevalently, on the profile on the coins. From about 50 BC on, Parthia saw frequent clashes with the Greco-oriented Rome. The new style is therefore perhaps a deliberate departure from the Hellenistic traditions <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> their own traditions and values.|$|E
25|$|After the {{departure}} of French troops in 1801 the Mamluks continued their struggle for independence; this time against the Ottoman Empire and Great Britain.

The Russian ambassador in Constantinople refused however to intervene, because of nationalist unrest in Georgia that might have been encouraged by a Mamluk return.|$|E
25|$|The shaman can {{descend to}} the underworld or ascend to heaven, often by {{climbing}} the World Tree, the cosmic pillar, the sacred ladder, {{or some other}} form of the axis mundi.
