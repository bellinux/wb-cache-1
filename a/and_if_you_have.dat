500|$|The {{relationship}} between both managers was evidently hostile to begin with. Ferguson noted that Wenger {{was the only}} manager he came across in the league not to share a drink with after matches – an English football [...] "tradition". In a joint interview with The Times and Daily Mail in 2009, Wenger said his discourtesy was mistaken for mistrust and managers [...] "cannot be completely friendly and open up." [...] When asked {{if this was the}} reason he avoided the post-match drink, he replied: [...] "Most of the time, yes. What can you say if you have won? <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> lost all {{you want to do is}} get home and prepare for the next game." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mountain of Madness" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, {{although}} the script underwent many rewrites. According to Josh Weinstein, [...] "a Swartzwelder script is like a finely tooled crazy German machine <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the wrong engineers try to fix it, it blows up. And that's the thing, 'cause it had great jokes but we sort of changed the story and went through a bunch of drafts." [...] The story was completely rewritten and as a result, the plot became odder and quirkier with the scenes of paranoia deriving from this. The original script was [...] "really crazy" [...] {{but a lot of}} the more insane material was cut. However, most of the rewrites were done during the script-writing and did not require any major animation changes. One change was the ending, which was added after the animatic. The episode features several pairings of established characters who had previously interacted little, such as Waylon Smithers with Bart and Lisa. Weinstein feels that this was one of the first episodes to really feature the duo of Lenny Leonard and Carl Carlson and developed them more.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm moving fast, Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a problem, I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} English poetical {{treatise on}} Angling by John Dennys, {{said to have}} been a fishing companion of Shakespeare, was published in 1613, The Secrets of Angling. Footnotes of the work, written by Dennys' editor, William Lawson, make the first mention of the phrase to 'cast a fly': [...] "The trout gives the most gentlemanly and readiest sport of all, if you fish with an artificial fly, a line twice your rod's length of three hairs' thickness... <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> learnt the cast of the fly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Updike often {{wrote about}} death, his {{characters}} providing a [...] "mosaic of reactions" [...] to mortality, ranging from terror to attempts at insulation. In The Poorhouse Fair (1959), the elderly John Hook intones, [...] "There is no goodness without belief... <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not believed, {{at the end}} of your life you shall know you have buried your talent in the ground of this world and have nothing saved, to take into the next", demonstrating a religious, metaphysical faith present in much of Updike's work.|$|E
2500|$|Interest in {{the book}} was revived during the 1999 lawsuit between Nancy Stouffer and J.K. Rowling over the {{creation}} of the name [...] "Muggles". An article in the Lawrence Journal-World on June 14, 2000, said Kendall had used the name about 30 years before Stouffer and Rowling. Kendall found the incident amusing and was not ill-disposed towards either author. Speaking about the copying, she said, [...] "I've got no quarrel with them...There's only so many ideas <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> one then someone else out there probably has the same one, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew {{it would}} be so," [...] Lisle said. [...] "It has been a glorious day <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> come in moping, I should <b>have</b> given <b>you</b> up as hopeless." ...|$|R

2500|$|Other Sikhs {{have since}} been granted {{permission}} as well, including Captain Kamaljeet Singh Kalsi, an Army doctor who {{told the story of}} how his first sergeant [...] "pulled him out of the crowd" [...] on his first day of training at Fort Sam Houston, to tell the other soldiers about the [...] "long ordeal" [...] Kalsi endured in order to enlist. He quoted the First Sergeant as saying that [...] "The Army is made up of different shades of green, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any objection to him being here, you need to tell me now," [...] at which point all the other soldiers applauded him.|$|E
2500|$|Solicitor General Paul D. Clement {{told the}} Court that he {{believed}} {{that even if the}} program had been set up by Congress instead of by an Executive Order there would still not be any standing for a taxpayer to sue, [...] "Because there has to be two things. There has to be a statute. And then {{there has to be an}} allegation that the statute creates a unique injury in the context of spending that affects taxpayers differently than anybodythan any other citizen. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a situation...where you don't have any spending that goes outside of the Government, then you might have an establishment clause problem, but it wouldn't be an establishment clause problem where the nub of the problem is the fact that money is spent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fisher was {{appointed}} to command [...] as flag captain to the Admiral of the North America and West Indies Station, Astley Cooper Key, from 2 March 1877 to 4 June 1878. Bellerophon {{had been in the}} dockyard for repairs, so the new crew was less than perfect in carrying out their duties. Fisher told them I intend to give you hell for three months, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not come up to my standard in that time you'll have hell for another three months. Midshipman (later Admiral) A. H. Gordon Moore reported, Fisher was a very exacting master and I had at times long and arduous duties, long hours at the engine room telegraphs in cold fog, etc., and the least inattention was punished. It was, I think, his way of proving us, for he always rewarded us in some way when an extra hard bit of work was over.|$|E
6000|$|Alton made {{a little}} gesture of impatience. [...] "No," [...] he said resolutely, [...] "you did not, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> done <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> had a reason {{that would have made}} it right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course <b>you</b> can; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{the art of}} {{correcting}} fortune, {{you could}} make use of what you see. At the least you would know whether to take a card or stand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, on yours. When we {{told him}} of your kind language, he at once assured us all that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> the power, <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> promised, would have the inclination, to procure Henry's pardon." ...|$|R
2500|$|In March 2007, {{during a}} news conference in Staten Island, Bloomberg {{declared}} his strong opposition to legislation proposed in Congress calling for a clear timetable for troop withdrawal. He said, [...] "We ask our young men and women to go over and to fight, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a deadline knowing they're pulling out, how can you expect them to defend this country? How can you expect them to go out and put their lives at risk? I just think that's untenable and {{that this is not a}} responsible piece of legislation. It is totally separate of how we're conducting the war. It's totally separate of whether we should have been there. The issue that you asked about is plain and simple: Should the Congress pass a law forcing the president to withdraw troops at a given point in time? I think that is not something that is in the country's interest or in the military's interest." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "For me {{the project}} and the passion for the game are very important. India needs a start. You need to progress. And for me, that was important. I had offers from the USA and Qatar but I {{wanted to be part}} of a new {{beginning}} for the sport in India. As for the conditions, we all know about them — but I'm ready and training hard. I like the pressure," [...] he said, making it clear that the USA and Qatar hardly excited him as much as India. Pirès is a regular at Arsenal's training ground, using the facilities to stay fit, and said that he spoke to Arsène Wenger about playing in India: [...] "He told me if you have it in you <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the passion to go play in India, then do it. And I think I'm ready." [...] "The reception at the airport was amazing," [...] he said, on his unveiling in India, before adding, [...] "Thank you for the welcome India... and the spicy food." ...|$|E
2500|$|Satana then starred as [...] "Varla" [...] in the 1965 film Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!—a very {{aggressive}} and sexual female character {{for which she}} did all of her own stunts and fight scenes. Renowned film critic Richard Corliss called her performance [...] "the most honest, maybe the one honest portrayal in the Meyer canon and certainly the scariest". Originally titled The Leather Girls, the film is an ode to female violence, based on a concept created by Russ Meyer and screenwriter Jack Moran. Both felt at her first audition that Satana was [...] "definitely Varla." [...] The film was shot on location in the desert outside Los Angeles during days when the weather was more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit and freezing nights, with Satana clashing regularly with teenage co-star Susan Bernard due to Bernard's mother's reportedly disruptive behavior on the set. Meyer said Satana was [...] "extremely capable. She knew how to handle herself. Don't fuck with her! <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to fuck her, do it well! She might turn on you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{not sure}} whether you would let me <b>have</b> it, mother; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> refused, <b>and</b> I had got it {{afterward}} from Mr. Renfrew, I should not have liked to bring her home here." ...|$|R
