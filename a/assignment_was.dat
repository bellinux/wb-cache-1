40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine whether the day of the week an <b>assignment</b> <b>is</b> due has an effect on the rate at which it is completed on time. If teacher intent is to decrease the number of missing <b>assignments,</b> <b>is</b> there a worst day of the week to have homework due? Is there a best day? The participants studied during the spring 2011 semester were 104 rural high school students in grades nine through twelve. Numbers of missing assignments for each day were analyzed using descriptive data and a Chi Square analysis of significance. The results indicate that the day of the week an <b>assignment</b> <b>is</b> due has a significant effect upon the rate of completion. The day with the most missed <b>assignments</b> <b>was</b> Monday. The day with the fewest missing <b>assignments</b> <b>was</b> Wednesday. In this rural school, teachers who assign homework that is due on a Wednesday will likely see fewer missing assignments, which may lead to greater student achievement...|$|R
