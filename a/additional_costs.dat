5|$|In January 2010 the {{independent}} arbiter found {{in favour of}} TIE on some points, but {{on most of the}} disputed issues ruled in favour of BSC and awarded the consortium 90% of its <b>additional</b> <b>costs,</b> estimated to be up to £80m.|$|E
5|$|As indicated, hospice is {{frequently}} under-utilized and often not {{taken advantage of}} until very late in a patient's illness. The reasons for this have {{as much to do}} with financial considerations as with the psycho-social difficulty in choosing hospice. A 2009 study found that with proper case management hospice access could be liberalized without <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> to insurers.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 International Energy Agency forum {{presented}} {{costs for}} managing intermittency {{as a function}} of wind-energy's share of total capacity for several countries, as shown in the table on the right. Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009, generally agree that variability of wind needs {{to be taken into account}} by adding 20% to the operating reserve, but it does not make the grid unmanageable. The <b>additional</b> <b>costs,</b> which are modest, can be quantified.|$|E

30|$|Taking {{a number}} needed to treat to harm for refracture of 154, {{assuming}} the refracture requires reoperation, the total <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> is ($ 2208  ×  154  =) $ 340, 032. Taking the lower NNTH for all-cause reoperation (83), {{by the same}} calculation we find an <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> of $ 183, 264 for the long CMN. Therefore, whether considering reoperation in general or reoperation only after refracture, the <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> of long CMN is considerable.|$|R
5|$|Another {{potential}} source of income was {{the prospect of a}} Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain. The policy of the Spanish Match, as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> of a war. Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009, TIE began legal {{proceedings}} against the BSC consortium over delays to the project, and track-laying on Leith Walk, Shandwick Place and Haymarket was suspended. At issue were alleged changes to BSC's work specification, including track works on Princes Street and £5 million <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> for foundation work near Murrayfield Stadium. The BSC consortium alleged that TIE had not diverted the underground utilities {{in time for}} track-laying to begin, breaching contractual agreements and costing the consortium additional staffing expenditure.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower {{the costs of}} mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent {{and need to be}} widely shared.|$|E

5|$|The {{purchase}} of the Boeing 707 aircraft would be followed by several orders for Vickers competing design, the VC10, with BOAC having ordered 35 VC10 aircraft by 1959 and an additional ten (bringing the total on order to 45) by 1961. Payments for these aircraft together with a downturn in transatlantic traffic, increased competition on the transatlantic route by additional carriers equipped with jet aircraft, and {{a whole host of}} <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> associated with the Vickers VC10 and Bristol Britannia purchase would result in BOAC becoming extremely unprofitable from late 1961 onwards.|$|E
5|$|A {{tower was}} {{built out of}} {{the remains of the}} roof, similar to one that had existed at Claremont Road, and a system of defences and {{blockades}} were built. A core of around 30 protesters ensured that there were always people staying there (a legal requirement for a squatted home, as well as a defence against eviction). They were finally evicted on 21 June 1995, whereupon, as at Claremont Road, the building was immediately demolished. The total cost of removing the protesters from Munstonia was given to be £239,349.52, not including <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> of security guards.|$|E
5|$|Brassey had {{considerable}} skill in choosing good men {{to work in}} this way and in delegating the work. Having taken on a contract at an agreed price {{he would make a}} suitable sum of money available to the agent to meet the costs. If the agent were able to fulfil the work at a lower cost he could keep the remainder of the money. If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable, Brassey would cover these <b>additional</b> <b>costs.</b> He used hundreds of such agents. At the peak of his career, for well over 20 years, Brassey was employing on average some 80,000 people in many countries in four continents.|$|E

5|$|In August 1999, the {{architect}} informed the project group that the Parliament {{would need to}} be further increased in size by 4,000squaremetres (43,000sqft). A subsequent costing revealed that taking into account the increased floorspace net construction costs had risen to £115m by September 1999. Early in 2000, the SPCB commissioned an independent report by {{the architect}} John Spencely. The report concluded that savings of 20% could be made on the current project and that scrapping the project completely at that stage or moving to another site would entail <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> of £30m. Spencely also cited poor communication between the SPCB and construction officials as increasingly costly. Given the outcomes of the Spencely report, MSPs voted to continue with the construction project on the Holyrood site in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on 5 April 2000.|$|E
5|$|In July 1992, the IOC {{voted to}} approve women's hockey as an Olympic event; {{it was first}} held at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano. The Nagano Organizing Committee was {{hesitant}} to include the event because of the <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> of staging the tournament, but an agreement was reached that limited the field to six teams, and ensured that no additional facilities would be built. The Canadian and American teams have dominated the event, typically losing only to each other. The United States won the first tournament in 1998. Canada won in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma {{set up the}} Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA) on January 10, 1935. Eventually, on September 18, 1937, {{with the}} help of Oklahoma Representative Wesley E. Disney, Senator Elmer Thomas and {{engineer}} W. R. Holway, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved $20 million in funding through the New Deal's Public Works Administration for the dam. The higher cost for the dam was attributed to a project that was approved for additional purposes, including hydroelectric power generation and recreation. <b>Additional</b> <b>costs</b> for the dam were covered by the state government and by GRDA municipal bond auctions which appropriated or raised $11 million. Disney had pushed much of the legislation for the dam, comparing the higher electric utility rates in Oklahoma compared to other states. Senator Thomas helped appropriate additional state and public funding for the dam while also being instrumental in its legislation.|$|E

5|$|The airline {{had three}} Boeing 737-300 aircraft, built in 1994. Originally fitted with 136 seats each, they were later reduced to 124, and then {{increased}} to 142. The aircraft were owned by International Lease Finance Corporation and General Electric Capital, and cost NOK 2.25 million per month to lease, plus <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> per hour. They were British-registered {{and operated by}} Air Foyle HeavyLift, while maintenance was performed by British Midland. Both companies are based in the United Kingdom. Ground handling {{was carried out by}} SAS Ground Services in Trondheim, Bergen and Ålesund, and by Servisair in Oslo.|$|E
5|$|Curing {{the leaks}} and {{cleaning}} up the contamination delayed the tunnel's completion by a year, and it was finally opened on 22 August 1999. The entire process was further complicated by conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the Scandinavian Rock Group. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during the incidents, which should have been addressed in 1995, but were never taken seriously. Compensation was paid for approximately 60 houses which were damaged {{as a result of}} tunnel construction. An evaluation by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was spent fixing the leaks, but the report claimed that this was to a large extent a waste of money, resulting from inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the construction of the entire railway. In total the extraordinary <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> for the tunnel totaled NOK1.3 billion.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{existence}} or upcoming construction of two divided highway corridors between Baltimore and Annapolis, a freeway connecting I-695 and US 50 was proposed {{as early as}} 1956 {{in the form of}} the Arundel Expressway, which would relieve congestion on MD 2. The portion of the Arundel Expressway that is today MD 10 was constructed from I-695 to MD 648 in Pasadena between 1970 and 1978. MD 10 was proposed to continued south of Pasadena as a toll road to US 50, but the section of the freeway south of MD 100 was removed from state plans by 1975. MD 10 was completed to its present end in Pasadena in 1991. The state of Maryland unsuccessfully petitioned the Federal Highway Administration for an Interstate designation for a Baltimore–Annapolis freeway after passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. However, the state was successful in obtaining Interstate mileage for the Baltimore–Annapolis corridor through the 1968 Howard–Cramer amendment, which provided for minor adjustments to the Interstate System if no <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> were incurred. Much of the mileage of what became I-97 was reallocated from canceled Interstate Highways in Baltimore and the Washington area.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of 2004, Fletcher {{proposed}} changes to the health benefits of state workers and retirees. Fletcher's plan provided discounts for members who engaged in healthier behavior, which he called a transition from a sickness initiative to a wellness initiative. Acknowledging that out-of-pocket expenses would rise, Fletcher proposed a 1% salary increase to offset the <b>additional</b> <b>costs.</b> State employees, particularly public school teachers, broadly opposed Fletcher's plan, and the Kentucky Educators Association called for an indefinite strike, to begin October 27, 2004. To address the opposition, Fletcher called a special session of the legislature to begin October 5, 2004. Although the state was still operating under an executive spending plan, Fletcher did not include the budget or his tax reform proposal in the session's agenda, a move praised by both parties, allowing them to focus only on concerns over the health plan. In a fifteen-day session, the General Assembly passed a plan that allocated $190 million more to health insurance for state workers and restored many of the most popular benefits in the previous insurance plan. Immediately after the session adjourned, the Kentucky Educators Association voted to cancel their proposed strike.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensions}} from Rickmansworth to Aylesbury and Chesham {{were designed}} by Charles Liddell and built by contractor James Firbank. Rather than follow {{the valley of the}} River Chess, which would have been the most convenient route to Chesham, the route out of Rickmansworth was intentionally built on higher ground to reduce the steep climb over the Chilterns towards Aylesbury, and thus rose steadily from Rickmansworth to a hilltop station at Amersham. At Chalfont Road station (renamed Chalfont& Latimer in 1915) the line to Chesham split from the line to Aylesbury. With a total length of 3miles 56chains (3mi 1,232yd; 5,955m), the single-track Chesham branch ran alongside the Aylesbury line for a short distance, before curving down the slope of the Chess Valley at a gradient of around 1 in 66. Chalk from the railway's cutting along the Chess Valley was used to build an embankment to bring the railway into the town centre. Bridging the watercress beds of the Chess Valley proved problematic, and the cost of the line exceeded its estimate. <b>Additional</b> <b>costs</b> were incurred by the laying of temporary track in early 1889 to allow the directors of the MR a trial trip along the route.|$|E
5|$|The {{financing}} plan involved {{public and private}} funding. At the time, the city planned to pay $75million for the acquisition {{of the land and}} construction of the stadium project. However, a 2017 audit revealed that it had actually paid $91million after accounting for <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> associated with the expedited schedule and infrastructure work around the project site. The stadium is owned by the city and is leased to the team for 30years, until 2045. The Sounds ownership group spent $50million on a new, mixed-use and retail development next to the facility. The construction of two apartment buildings with retail space beyond the left field wall is scheduled to be completed in early 2018. North of the site, Embrey Development Corp. built a privately funded apartment complex called The Carillon. The city's original $75million planned expenditure resulted in taking on $4.3million in annual debt, paid for by five city revenue streams: an annual $700,000 Sounds' lease payment, $650,000 in stadium-generated sales tax revenue, $750,000 in property taxes from the Sounds development, $675,000 in property taxes from the Embrey development, and $520,000 in tax increment financing. The additional overage was paid with existing Metro capital funds. The city pays $345,000 for annual maintenance of the stadium.|$|E
