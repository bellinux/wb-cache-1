5|$|In one Vietnam War scene, Gump carries Bubba {{away from}} an {{incoming}} napalm attack. To create the effect, stunt <b>actors</b> <b>were</b> initially used for compositing purposes. Then, Hanks and Williamson were filmed, with Williamson supported by a cable wire as Hanks ran with him. The explosion was then filmed, and the <b>actors</b> <b>were</b> digitally added to appear {{just in front of}} the explosions. The jet fighters and napalm canisters were also added by CGI.|$|E
5|$|The {{thematic}} and period {{setting of}} Carnivàle required an unusual casting approach. While some <b>actors</b> <b>were</b> hired for their genetic disabilities, most <b>actors</b> <b>were</b> specifically cast for their unique and distinct looks {{to fit the}} 1930s period. Award-winning costumes and make-up enhanced the illusion. Reviews generally lauded the actors and characters, and several actors received award recognition for their performances.|$|E

The hosts which act as Quince runtimes and which have instances of each actor in the system are announced via the configuration store.|$|R
5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the <b>actors</b> <b>were</b> required {{to sit in the}} car in front of a blue screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects. The car itself was attached to a separate rig that was built to replicate the impact of the crash. As the scene was shot, the rig flipped the car onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the <b>actors</b> <b>were</b> protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded onto them.|$|E

5|$|Many critics did {{not like}} the film, {{comparing}} it unfavorably with the films of John Waters and criticizing the colorful production design. Although the lead <b>actors</b> <b>were</b> praised for their performances, some of the characters were described as stereotypical.|$|E
5|$|A team at Naughty Dog {{designed}} the character appearances, and creative director Neil Druckmann {{was the main}} writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The <b>actors</b> <b>were</b> given considerable license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, simultaneously performing the motion capture work for their characters. Various characters were influenced by the story progression, ultimately becoming completely different from the initial vision. The relationship of the characters received praise from several gaming publications, and the acting has resulted in multiple awards, including two BAFTAs and a DICE Award.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement {{was created by}} zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and <b>actors</b> <b>were</b> put {{in a variety of}} rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography.

In August 2011, Variety reported that actor and martial artist Donnie Yen was offered a role in the film; however, Yen declined the role because he did not find it intriguing.|$|E
5|$|Ben Palmer, the {{director}} of the first Inbetweeners film, was involved with Simon Pegg's film Man Up, so Morris and Beesley directed The Inbetweeners 2.

5|$|Brookwood {{was one of}} the few cemeteries {{to permit}} burials on Sundays, which made it a popular choice with the poor as it allowed people to attend {{funerals}} without the need to take a day off work.

5|$|Compounding matters was {{the fact}} that the {{supposedly}} deceased actors had signed contracts with the production which ensured that they would not appear in any type of media, motion pictures, or commercials for one year following the film's release. This was done in order to promote the idea that Cannibal Holocaust was truly the recovered footage of missing documentarians. During the subsequent court proceedings, questions arose as to why the <b>actors</b> <b>were</b> in no other media if they were alive as Deodato claimed.|$|E
5|$|Development on {{the project}} began in 2011 after the rights to Isaacson's book were acquired. Sorkin wrote the {{screenplay}} with filming beginning in January 2015.
