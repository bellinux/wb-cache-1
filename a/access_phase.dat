500|$|Mini Metro {{received}} [...] "generally favourable" [...] reception from critics {{according to}} aggregate review website Metacritic. Technology Tell writer, Jenni Lada described Mini Metro as [...] "aesthetically pleasing" [...] and found {{playing the game}} an oddly relaxing experience, despite the game's attempt to put the player under pressure. Lena LeRay, of IndieGames.com, also felt that Mini Metro had a relaxing tone and complimented its intuitive interface. LeRay appreciated changes that were made during the early <b>access</b> <b>phase,</b> noting that audio and the Daily Challenge mode were welcome additions, and the interface improvements had diminished her initial complaints about the game. Reviewing the PC version, GamesTM thought that the depth of Mini Metros gameplay along with the difficulty scaling kept the game interesting. However, they did question why the game hadn't been released for smartphones yet, pointing out that such devices would be suited for the game's simple interface. Kill Screen editor, Ethan Gach commended the game for its simplicity and elegance, having combined interactive aesthetics with a robust simulation. Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun praised the game for being a [...] "mesmerising challenge of logic and aesthetics". He particularly enjoyed how beautifully the gameplay descended into chaos as the difficulty gradually increased, calling it [...] "elegant even in disaster". He also thought that Mini Metro was {{a good example of}} how to release game in early access. Reviewing the mobile version, Gamezebo writer Rob Rich commended the visual design and intuitive touch controls. He thought that the use of geometric shapes to represent commuters and stations helped simplify the complicated tasks, resulting in an accessible game. Pocket Gamer reviewer Christian Valentin remarked that the game felt confusing early on but became [...] "surprisingly engaging".|$|E
2500|$|The {{prefetch}} architecture {{takes advantage}} of the specific characteristics of memory accesses to DRAM. Typical DRAM memory operations involve three phases: bitline precharge, row access, column access. Row access is the heart of a read operation, as it involves the careful sensing of the tiny signals in DRAM memory cells; it is the slowest phase of memory operation. However, once a row is read, subsequent column accesses to that same row can be very quick, as the sense amplifiers also act as latches. For reference, a row of a 1 Gbit DDR3 device is 2,048 bits wide, so internally 2,048 bits are read into 2,048 separate sense amplifiers during the row <b>access</b> <b>phase.</b> [...] Row accesses might take 50 ns, depending on the speed of the DRAM, whereas column accesses off an open row are less than 10 ns.|$|E

2500|$|Bluehole used closed alpha and beta periods {{with about}} 80,000 players, {{including}} popular streamers, to gauge initial {{reaction to the}} gameplay and adjust balance prior to a wider release. The early <b>access</b> <b>phase</b> on Steam began in March 2017 for the Windows version. This early access period was planned to last approximately six months, originally aiming for a September 2017 release. In July 2017, Greene announced that {{they would need to}} extend the early access period by a few months, continuing to release updates on a regular basis, with plans to still release by the end of 2017, as committing to this original period [...] "could hinder us from delivering a fully featured game and/or lead to disappointment within the community if the launch deadline is not met". Initially, Bluehole had expected that they would just gain enough players through early access to smooth out the gameplay, and only when the game was completed, they would have started more marketing for the title. The sudden interest in the game from early access exceeded their expectations, and put emphasis on the stability of the game and its underlying networking alongside gameplay improvements. Through August 2017, these updates generally included a major weekly patch alongside major monthly updates that provided key performance improvements. However, from August onward Bluehole backed off the rate of such patches, as the high frequency has led to some quality control issues, and the developers rather make sure each patch content is well-vetted by the community before providing new updates; this did not change their plans for a 2017 release. Bluehold anticipated to leave the early access period by late December 2017.|$|E

30|$|In [1] the {{asynchronous}} POWMAC protocol is proposed. This protocol uses {{a so-called}} <b>access</b> window <b>phase,</b> {{to agree on}} a set of transmissions that can simultaneously proceed. During the signaling for a transmission, each potential receiver announces the transmission power to be used by the communication partner as well as a common maximum interference level it can tolerate from a single newly starting transmission. Each transmitter that starts its own signaling afterwards must assure that it does not violate any of the interference tolerance levels included in preceding signals. After the <b>access</b> window <b>phase</b> multiple data transmissions can take place simultaneously.|$|R

However, several gaps have been identified, especially those concerning contention <b>access</b> <b>phases</b> {{and the lack of}} synchronization between star coordinators.

40|$|The requirements, features, and {{implementation}} of the port interface unit for the Lutonium asynchronous microcontroller are covered in detail. The Lutonium is a new microcontroller that is pin- and software compatible with the Intel 8051 family of microcontrollers, and it is being designed by the Caltech Asynchronous VLSI Group. The port interface unit controls five 8 -bit I/O ports, exposing them to the processor as directly accessible registers. The port interface unit also sequences external memory bus <b>access</b> <b>phases</b> using the same I/O ports. The final design allows both backward compatibility with the 8051 series and many advanced power-saving features. It is built around a primary state machine responsible for controlling and sequencing basic operations.

50|$|Brad Carney started {{development}} {{of the game in}} 2008 on his own WrackEd game engine. The game was initially called Project Vega, then The Last Bastion, before finally being titled Wrack. The title of The Last Bastion was changed to Wrack to avoid confusion with the similarly titled indie game Bastion. Carney wanted to avoid potential copyright claim issues and also believed Wrack was an easier name to remember. His reasoning toward developing the game was his belief that the presence of Doom-like shooters were missing during that time from the gaming market. Carney later stopped the project and worked at other game development studios. When he resumed work on Wrack, he had to get it through Steam Greenlight. The game was eventually greenlit and went on to Steam as an Early Access title. As he continued to work on Wrack, he hired other artists and developers to help him. He asked Bobby Prince, who composed for Doom and Duke Nukem 3D, to provide the game's score and sound design. On September 30, 2014 the game moved out of the Early <b>Access</b> <b>phase.</b>|$|E
