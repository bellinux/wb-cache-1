40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{development}} of new gamma ray imagers for nuclear medicine, in particular for scintimammography. The need for new compact detectors with high spatial resolution led to the design of the wavelength-shifting fibre (WSF) gamma camera, where the position of interaction of gamma rays inside an inorganic scintillator is read out by WSFs. The feasibility of the concept of a WSF gamma camera was assessed by simple analytical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, based on the known characteristics of the individual components: the wavelength-shifting fibres, the scintillation crystal and the photodetectors. Studies were carried out of the light trapped inside WSFs coupled to CsI(Na) scintillation crystals irradiated by 122 keV gamma rays. The results confirm the feasibility of a WSF gamma camera despite the low light levels trapped in the fibres. Experimental tests of several position sensitive photomultiplier tubes (PSPMT) of the Hamamatsu R 5900 series were performed to assess their suitability for the readout of scintillation crystals and of optical fibres in photon counting mode. The latter application is important for the readout of the WSFs signals in a WSF gamma camera. A WSF gamma camera prototype was built and tested. The R 5900 -M 16 PSPMT was used to read out the signals from WSFs. The results confirm earlier predictions about its performance. In particular, the spatial resolution achieved is comparable to that of modern <b>Anger</b> <b>cameras.</b> It is expected that the inherently flexible design of the camera should allow better positioning around the object than conventional <b>Anger</b> <b>cameras,</b> which is important to optimise the spatial resolution of the system.

5000|$|The {{origins of}} this medical idea date {{back as far}} as the mid-1920s in Freiburg, Germany, when George de Hevesy made {{experiments}} with radionuclides administered to rats, thus displaying metabolic pathways of these substances and establishing the tracer principle. Possibly, the genesis of this medical field took place in 1936, when John Lawrence, known as [...] "the father of nuclear medicine", took a leave of absence from his faculty position at Yale Medical School, to visit his brother Ernest Lawrence at his new radiation laboratory (now known as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) in Berkeley, California. Later on, John Lawrence made the first application in patients of an artificial radionuclide when he used phosphorus-32 to treat leukemia. Many historians consider the discovery of artificially produced radionuclides by Frédéric Joliot-Curie and Irène Joliot-Curie in 1934 as the most significant milestone in nuclear medicine. In February 1934, they reported the first artificial production of radioactive material in the journal Nature, after discovering radioactivity in aluminum foil that was irradiated with a polonium preparation. Their work built upon earlier discoveries by Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen for X-ray, Henri Becquerel for radioactive uranium salts, and Marie Curie (mother of Irène Curie) for radioactive thorium, polonium and coining the term [...] "radioactivity." [...] Taro Takemi studied the application of nuclear physics to medicine in the 1930s. The history of nuclear medicine will not be complete without mentioning these early pioneers. Nuclear medicine gained public recognition as a potential specialty on December 7, 1946 when an article was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association by Sam Seidlin. The article described a successful treatment of a patient with thyroid cancer metastases using radioiodine (I-131). This is considered by many historians as the most important article ever published in nuclear medicine. Although the earliest use of I-131 was devoted to therapy of thyroid cancer, its use was later expanded to include imaging of the thyroid gland, quantification of the thyroid function, and therapy for hyperthyroidism. Among the many radionuclides that were discovered for medical-use, none were as important as the discovery and development of Technetium-99m. It was first discovered in 1937 by C. Perrier and E. Segre as an artificial element to fill space number 43 in the Periodic Table. The development of a generator system to produce Technetium-99m in the 1960s became a practical method for medical use. Today, Technetium-99m is the most utilized element in nuclear medicine and is employed {{in a wide variety of}} nuclear medicine imaging studies. Widespread clinical use of nuclear medicine began in the early 1950s, as knowledge expanded about radionuclides, detection of radioactivity, and using certain radionuclides to trace biochemical processes.

Simultaneous 99 mTc-sestamibi/ 123 I-BMIPP imaging was proposed for assessing rest perfusion and fatty acid metabolism {{at the same time}} in patients with recent myocardial infarction [23, 24]. The dual-isotope acquisition protocol using 201 Tl and 123 I-mIBG is well documented on conventional <b>Anger</b> <b>cameras,</b> using the triple-energy window [25] for scatter and crosstalk correction.

In a recent study, Gimelli et al.

40|$|Gamma ray imaging {{is usually}} {{accomplished}} {{by the use}} of a relatively large scintillating crystal coupled to either a number of photomultipliers (PMTs) (<b>Anger</b> <b>Camera)</b> or to a single large Position Sensitive PMT (PSPMT). Recently the development of new diagnostic techniques, such as scintimammography and radio-guided surgery, have highlighted a number of significant limitations of the <b>Anger</b> <b>camera</b> in such imaging procedures. In this paper a dedicated gamma camera is proposed for clinical applications with the aim of improving image quality by utilizing detectors with an appropriate size and shape for the part of the body under examination. This novel scintillation camera is based upon an array of PSPMTs (Hamamatsu R 5900 -C 8). The basic concept of this camera is identical to the <b>Anger</b> <b>Camera</b> {{with the exception of the}} substitution of PSPMTs for the PMTs. In this configuration it is possible to use the high resolution of the PSPMTs and still correctly position events lying between PSPMTs.

Some advantages of this camera are: spatial resolution less than 2 mm FWHM, good linearity, thickness less than 3 cm, light weight, lower cost than equivalent area PSPMT, large detection area when coupled to scintillating arrays, small dead boundary zone (< 3 mm) and flexibility in the shape of the camera...|$|E
40|$|Radionuclide cancer therapy {{requires}} imaging radiotracers that concentrate in tumors and emit {{high energy}} charged particles that kill tumor cells. These tracers, such as 131 I, generally emit high energy photons {{that need to}} be imaged to estimate tumor dose and changes in size during treatment. This research describes the performance of a dual-planar silicon-based Compton imaging system and compares it to a conventional parallel-hole collimated <b>Anger</b> <b>camera</b> with high energy general purpose lead collimator for imaging photons emitted from 131 I. The collimated <b>Anger</b> <b>camera</b> imposes a tradeoff between resolution and sensitivity due to the mechanical collimation. As the energy of photons exceed 364 keV, increased septal penetration and scattering further degrade the imaging performance. Simulations of the <b>Anger</b> <b>camera</b> and the Compton imaging system demonstrate a 20 -fold advantage in detection efficiency and higher spatial resolution for detecting high energy photons by the Compton camera since it decouples the tradeoff. The system performance and comparision are analyzed using the modified uniform Cramer-Rao bound algorithms we developed along with the Monte Carlo calculations and system modeling. The bound show that the effect of Doppler broadening is the limiting factor for Compton camera performance for imaging 364 keV photons. Performance of the two systems was compared and analyzed by simulating a 2 D disk with uniform activities. For the case in which the two imaging systems detected the same number of events, the proposed Compton imaging system has lower image variance than the <b>Anger</b> <b>camera</b> with HEGP when the FWHM of the desired point source response is less than 1. 2 cm. This advantage was also demonstrated by imaging and reconstructing a 2 D hot spot phantom. In addition to the performance analysis, the distributed Maximum Likelihood Maximization Expectation algorithm with chessboard data partition was evaluated for speeding up image reconstruction for the Compton imaging system. A 1 x 64 distributed computing system speeded computation by about a factor of 22 compared to a single processor.

40|$|The {{development}} of medical imaging techniques has dramatically changed clinical practice and biomedical {{science in the}} 20 th century. Nuclear Medicine imaging techniques reveal the function of organs and tissues in vivo {{with the aid of}} radioactively labeled tracer molecules. These techniques, such as Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), are clinically applied in the fields of neurology, oncology, cardiology, skeletal and thyroid imaging. Applied to small animals, these techniques are important tools in {{development of}} better diagnostics and new drugs and fundamental biological research. For small animal SPECT systems, pinhole magnification enables image resolutions below 0. 3 mm using conventional <b>Anger</b> <b>cameras</b> with an intrinsic spatial resolution of only 3 to 4 mm. There is a large desire to improve the spatial resolution of the gamma detectors to further improve the preclinical and clinical SPECT performance as well as to make systems more compact. This thesis focuses on EM-CCD based scintillation gamma cameras with a very high spatial resolution, more than 10 times better than conventional <b>Anger</b> <b>cameras.</b> Therefore these EM-CCD gamma cameras are a candidate {{for the next generation of}} pre-clinical-SPECT scanners. In pinhole SPECT cameras the spatial resolution is severely degraded for gamma photons incident at an angle, called the depth-of-interaction effect. We showed that this effect can be overcome using a novel curved scintillator geometry which results in a scintillation light centroid independent of the depth-of-interaction. Alternatively we strongly reduced the depth-of-interaction effect by using a multi scale algorithm that detects the scintillation depth. This depth is determined by modelling the variation of the scintillation light spread with depth. If we also take the statistics of the detector into account using a Maximum Likelihood scintillation detection algorithm the energy resolution of the detector improves significantly. Furthermore, using the Cramer Rao lower bound we showed that the EM-CCD based gamma camera performance is very sensitive to the scintillator light yield and the Clock Induced Charge (CIC) and dark current noise. A feasible reduction of these noise sources would improve the gamma camera performance significantly. RRRApplied Science...|$|R

MBq‐ 1 : 11. 4 ± 2. 6, 5. 6 ± 1. 4, 2. 7 ± 0. 7, and 0. 6 ± 0. 1); 2) for central spatial resolution: Discovery‐NM 530 c (6. 7 mm), DSPECT (8. 6 mm), IQSPECT (15. 0 mm) and Conventional‐SPECT (15. 3 mm), also in accordance with the analysis of the sharpness of myocardial contours on human images (in cm‐ 1 : 1. 02 ± 0. 17, 0. 92 ± 0. 11, 0. 64 ± 0. 12 and 0. 65 ± 0. 06, respectively); and 3) for contrast‐ to‐noise ratio on phantom: Discovery‐NM 530 c (4. 6), DSPECT (4. 1), IQSPECT (3. 9), Conv‐SPECT (3. 5), similarly to that documented on human images (5. 2 ± 1. 0, 4. 5 ± 0. 5, 3. 9 ± 0. 6 and 3. 4 ± 0. 3, respectively). Conclusion. The performances of CZT cameras are dramatically higher than those from <b>Anger</b> <b>cameras,</b> even in conditions of human SPECT images. However, CZT cameras differ in that spatial resolution and contrast‐to‐noise ratio are better with the Discovery‐NM 530 c, whereas count sensitivity is markedly higher with the DSPECT...|$|R
