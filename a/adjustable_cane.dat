For instance, a quad cane has a base attached to the shaft that provides increased stability by having four ferrules, and an <b>adjustable</b> <b>cane</b> may have two shaft segments telescoping one inside the other to allow adjustment for multiple sizes.|$|E
40|$|Our {{aim is to}} {{estimate}} inter-observer reliability, test-retest reliability, anthropometric and biomechanical adequacy and minimal detectable change when measuring the length of single-point <b>adjustable</b> <b>canes</b> in community-dwelling older adults. There are 112 participants in the study. They are men and women, aged 60 [*]years and over, who were attending an outpatient community health centre. An exploratory study design was used. Participants underwent two assessments within the same day by two independent observers and by the same observer at an interval of 15 - 45 [*]days. Two measures were used to establish {{the length of a}} single-point adjustable cane: the distance from the distal wrist crease to the floor (WF) and the distance {{from the top of the}} greater trochanter of the femur to the floor (TF). Each individual was fitted according to these two measures, and elbow flexion angle was measured. Inter-observer reliability and the test-retest reliability were high in both TF (ICC(3. 1) [*]=[*] 0. 918 and ICC(2. 1) [*]=[*] 0. 935) and WF measures (ICC(3. 1) [*]=[*] 0. 967 and ICC(2. 1) [*]=[*] 0. 960). Only 1 % of the individuals kept an elbow flexion angle within the standard recommendation of 30 °[*]±[*] 10 ° when the cane length was determined by the TF measure, and 30 % of the participants when the cane was determined by the WF measure. The minimal detectable cane length change was 2. 2 [*]cm. Our results suggest that, even though both measures are reliable, cane length determined by WF distance is more appropriate to keep the elbow flexion angle within the standard recommendation. The minimal detectable change corresponds to approximately a hole in the cane adjustment. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} energy {{expenditure}} {{in patients with}} unilateral knee osteoarthritis while walking with canes of different lengths. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study (single-group) was carried out on thirty patients with unilateral knee osteoarthritis. An <b>adjustable</b> aluminum <b>cane</b> was used, and three different cane lengths were determined for each subject: C 1 - length from the floor to the greater trochanter; C 2 - length from the floor to the distal wrist crease; and C 3 - length obtained by the formula: height x 0. 45 + 0. 87 m. Resting and walking heart rates were measured with a Polar hear rate meter. Walking speed was calculated by the time required for the patient to walk 10 m. Gait energy cost was estimated using the physiological cost index, and results were compared. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 25 women and five men (average age of 68 years). Statistically significant differences in physiological cost index measurements were observed between unassisted walking and assisted walking with a cane of any length (p< 0. 001), {{as well as between}} walking with a C 2 -length cane and unassisted walking, and walking with a C 1 -length cane and walking with a C 3 -length cane (p= 0. 001; p = 0. 037; p= 0. 001; respectively). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that small alterations in the length of canes used for weight-bearing ambulation in patients with unilateral knee osteoarthritis increase the energy expenditure measured by the physiological cost index during walking. Further studies are needed for a more precise quantification of the increase in energy expenditure during cane-assisted gait and an assessment of the effectiveness of cane use in relieving pain and improving function in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
