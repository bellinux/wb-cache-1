5|$|Great Auk calls {{included}} low croaking and <b>a</b> <b>hoarse</b> scream. A captive {{great auk}} was observed making a gurgling noise when anxious. It {{is not known}} what its other vocalizations were, but {{it is believed that}} they were {{similar to those of the}} razorbill, only louder and deeper.|$|E
5|$|Loss of {{function}} of the vagus nerve (X) {{will lead to a}} loss of parasympathetic innervation to {{a very large number of}} structures. Major effects of damage to the vagus nerve may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Isolated dysfunction of only the vagus nerve is rare, but can be diagnosed by <b>a</b> <b>hoarse</b> voice, due to dysfunction of one of its branches, the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites are {{generally}} silent, {{except in the}} breeding season when their calls, though weak, can be persistent. They primarily utter clear whistled 'chee, chee, chee' calls in flight and while hovering, or <b>a</b> <b>hoarse</b> wheezing 'skree-ah' when perched. The call has been confused {{with that of a}} silver gull. A short high whistle is the primary contact call between a pair, while a harsh scraping call is the most common call used by females and large young, and brooding females call to their young with a deep, soft, frog-like croak.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hang, Freshie!" [...] {{bellowed}} {{a freshman}} from the topmost row. It was {{acceptance of the}} challenge, the battle-cry flung down to the Sophs. A roar arose from the pit.

6000|$|... "His Government!" [...] echoed Bunker, with <b>a</b> <b>hoarser</b> laugh; [...] "hear him!--HIS Government!

Why, this yer {{revolution}} is played out, old man; and Generalissimo Leonidas Perkins is locked up in the Presidio." ...|$|R
5|$|McKay {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Kimball could still serve as an apostle even if he underwent a complete laryngectomy and advised him {{to go forward with}} the procedure. Martin subsequently surgically removed one of Kimball's vocal cords and half of the other, leaving him barely able to speak above <b>a</b> <b>hoarse</b> whisper. After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957, he was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public. Kimball's voice remained raspy throughout the rest of his life, and he usually wore an ear-mounted microphone to help magnify his voice, even when he was speaking at normal microphone-equipped pulpits.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws also have <b>a</b> <b>hoarse,</b> drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep {{at about a}} week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.|$|E
25|$|Esophageal {{cancer is}} cancer {{arising from the}} esophagus—the food pipe that runs between the throat and the stomach. Symptoms often include {{difficulty}} in swallowing and weight loss.

25|$|Throat cancer usually {{begins with}} {{symptoms}} that seem harmless enough, like an enlarged lymph node {{on the outside}} of the neck, a sore throat or <b>a</b> <b>hoarse</b> sounding voice. However, in the case of throat cancer, these conditions may persist and become chronic. There may be a lump or a sore in the throat or neck that does not heal or go away. There may be difficult or painful swallowing. Speaking may become difficult. There may be a persistent earache. Other possible but less common symptoms include some numbness or paralysis of the face muscles.|$|E
25|$|This glossy all-black crow has a {{heavy black}} bill with an arching culmen (upper {{edge of the}} mandible) and has a fine tip. The {{feathers}} have a purple gloss throughout. The tail of the Indian jungle crow is rounded and the legs and feet are stout. The Himalayan japonensis (in this sense including western intermedius and eastern tibetosinensis) has a slightly wedge-shaped tail and a voice is a guttural and grating graak (intermedius) or <b>a</b> <b>hoarse</b> kyarrh (tibetosinensis). The calls of the Indian jungle crow are not unlike that of the house crow but are harsher. In Sri Lanka, the house crow lacks the light grey neck but the neck is slimmer than in the jungle crow. The sexes are indistinguishable.|$|E

500|$|The auditory, or [...] "acoustic" [...] {{abnormalities}} {{observed with}} the syndrome include {{sensorineural hearing loss}} and hoarseness. Two affected Turkish brothers with a mild form of this hearing loss, and <b>a</b> <b>hoarse</b> voice were reported. A laryngoscopic examination of both brothers revealed swelling of the vocal cords, and a malformed epiglottis. Sensorineural-associated hearing impairment and hoarsness was also observed in a 10-year-old girl and her father, and {{in a number of}} other cases.|$|E
500|$|Croup, {{also known}} as laryngotracheobronchitis, {{is a type of}} {{respiratory}} infection that is usually caused by a virus. The infection leads to swelling inside the trachea, which interferes with normal breathing and produces the classic symptoms of [...] "barking" [...] cough, stridor, and <b>a</b> <b>hoarse</b> voice. Fever and runny nose may also be present. These symptoms may be mild, moderate, or severe. Often it starts or is worse at night. It normally lasts one to two days.|$|E

500|$|In 1970, Williams and Wisefield {{joined with}} singer Mick Stubbs, keyboardist Clive John and drummer Mick Cook {{to form the}} {{progressive}} rock group Home. The band signed a recording deal with Epic Records and issued their debut LP, Pause for <b>a</b> <b>Hoarse</b> Horse, in 1971. Home was a supporting act for Jeff Beck, Mott the Hoople, The Faces and Led Zeppelin. In 1972, Jim Anderson replaced John on keyboards and Home released a self-titled album, featuring their only hit single, [...] "Dreamer", which peaked at No.41 in the UK album charts. Their next album, The Alchemist, followed in 1973, but did not gain chart success. When British folk singer-songwriter Al Stewart suggested that Home back him on his first American tour in March 1974, Mick Stubbs left the group. The rest of the members became the Al Stewart Band, but split up after the tour.|$|E
500|$|Trent's Last Case is an {{adaptation}} of British author E. C. Bentley's 1913 novel of the same name, which had already been adapted for cinema in England in 1920. Hawks considered the novel to be [...] "one of the greatest detective stories of all time" [...] and was eager to make it his first sound film. He cast Raymond Griffith in the lead role of Phillip Trent. Griffith's throat had been damaged by poison gas during World War I and his voice was <b>a</b> <b>hoarse</b> whisper, prompting Hawks to later state, [...] "I thought {{he ought to be}} great in talking pictures because of that voice." [...] However, after shooting only a few scenes, Fox shut Hawks down and ordered him to make a silent film, both because of Griffith's voice and because they only owned the legal rights to make a silent film. The film did have a musical score and synchronized sound effects, but no dialogue. Due to the failing business of silent films, it was never released in the US and only briefly screened in England where film critics hated it. The film was believed lost until the mid-1970s and was screened {{for the first time in}} the US at a Hawks retrospective in 1974. Hawks was in attendance of the screening and attempted to have the only print of the film destroyed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{symptoms}} of the disease vary greatly from individual to individual. [...] They may include <b>a</b> <b>hoarse</b> voice, lesions and scarring on the skin, easily damaged skin with poor wound healing, dry, wrinkly skin, and beading of the papules around the eyelids. [...] All of these are results of a general thickening of the skin and mucous membranes. In some cases {{there is also a}} hardening of brain tissue in the medial temporal lobes, which can lead to epilepsy and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. [...] The disease is typically not life-threatening and patients do not show a decreased life span.|$|E
