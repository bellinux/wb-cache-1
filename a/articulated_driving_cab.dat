50|$|On most lines, {{trains are}} formed from a pairing or triplet of units. Units are 'single-ended', {{where there is}} a <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> at one end only, or 'double-ended', {{where there is a}} <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> at both ends. In addition, some units have no <b>driving</b> <b>cabs,</b> and thus must always be {{included}} {{in the middle of a}} formation of units.|$|R
50|$|A B unit, in {{railroad}} terminology, is {{a locomotive}} unit (generally a diesel locomotive) {{which does not}} have a <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> or crew compartment, and must therefore be controlled from another, coupled locomotive with a <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> (an A unit). The terms booster unit and cabless are also used. The concept is largely confined to North America. Elsewhere, locomotives without <b>driving</b> <b>cabs</b> are rare.|$|R
50|$|One single car was {{converted}} in February 1986 from former Iyo Railway 100 series car MoHa 106, purchased in October 1985. This car {{was built in}} 1950 by Teikoku Sharyo as KuHa 405, and converted to become single-car MoHa 106 with an additional <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> in 1961. The second <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> was subsequently taken out of use and a gangway door added, but from 1967, the <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> was reinstated, with the gangway door left in place.|$|R

50|$|The XRB {{class were}} built by Pacific National at their South Dynon {{workshops}} They are mechanically {{similar to the}} XR class, but are B units without <b>driving</b> <b>cabs.</b> The class are used as booster units on standard gauge interstate freight trains.

This paper presents a method, elaborated with the help of engineers, ergonomists and train drivers, for designing and evaluating auditory interfaces for use in high speed train <b>driving</b> <b>cabs.</b> During this design project, ergonomists studied the usefulness and the usability of auditory signals, in relation to visual displays and future <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> control devices.

50|$|EMUs {{are still}} in {{frequent}} revenue service around South East Queensland. They operate on all Queensland Rail suburban lines in either three or six carriage units. EMU01-EMU04, EMU06-EMU59 and EMU80-EMU88 have <b>driving</b> <b>cabs</b> at both ends and can either operate as three or six car units. EMU60-EMU79 have only a single <b>driving</b> <b>cab,</b> and as a result, they can operate only {{as part of a}} six car unit. EMU05 was extensively damaged in 2001 and is no longer in service.|$|R
50|$|Since the <b>driving</b> <b>cab's</b> {{noise level}} {{had to be}} below 85 decibels, cab 2 was {{selected}} as the Class 18E <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> primarily based on its lower noise level compared to cab 1 which was closer and more exposed to the compressor's noise and vibration. Another factor was the closer proximity of cab 2 to the low voltage switch panel. The fact that the handbrake was located in cab 2 was not a deciding factor, but was considered an additional benefit.|$|R
