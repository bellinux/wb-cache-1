5|$|Bryan v. Itasca County, 426 U.S. 373 (1976), was <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the Supreme Court of the United States {{held that}} a state {{did not have the}} right to assess a tax on the {{property}} of a Native American (Indian) living on tribal land absent a specific Congressional grant of authority to do so.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{developer}} {{control was}} asserted involved Blizzard Entertainment's action against Tristan Pope's Not Just Another Love Story. Blizzard's community managers encouraged users to post game movies and screenshots, but viewers complained that Pope's suggestion of sexual actions through creative camera and character positioning was pornographic. Citing the user license agreement, Blizzard closed discussion threads {{about the film}} and prohibited links to it. Although Pope accepted Blizzard's right to some control, he remained concerned about censorship of material that already existed in-game in some form. Discussion ensued about boundaries between MMORPG player and developer control. Lowood asserted that this controversy demonstrated that machinima could be a medium of negotiation for players.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the Taft Court {{struck down}} {{regulation}} that generated a dissent from {{the chief justice}} was Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Congress had decreed a minimum wage {{for women in the}} District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions; Taft, in dissent, deemed this unrealistic. Taft's dissent in Adkins was rare both because he authored few dissents, and because {{it was one of the}} few times he took an expansive view of the police power of the government.|$|E

One month into her tenure, the Supeme Court decided Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, where the court struck down {{the implementation of the}} Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate as violating Hobby Lobby's religious freedom. The Supreme Court also decided King v. Burwell, <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the Court upheld the Affordable Care Act's subsidies for healthcare plans purchased on federal exchanges.|$|E
5|$|Glik v. Cunniffe, 655 F.3d 78 (1st Cir. 2011) is <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit {{held that}} a private citizen {{has the right to}} record video and audio of public {{officials}} in a public place, and that the arrest of the citizen for a wiretapping violation violated his First and Fourth Amendment rights. The case arose when Simon Glik, a private citizen, filmed Boston, Massachusetts, police officers making an arrest in a public park. When the officers observed that Glik was recording the arrest, they arrested him and he was subsequently charged with wiretapping, disturbing the peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner. Glik then sued the City of Boston and the arresting officers, claiming that they violated his constitutional rights.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Sac & Fox Nation, 508 U.S. 114 (1993), was <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the Supreme Court of the United States {{held that}} absent {{explicit}} congressional direction to the contrary, {{it must be}} presumed that a State does not have jurisdiction to tax tribal members {{who live and work}} in Indian country, whether the particular territory consists of a formal or informal reservation, allotted lands, or dependent Indian communities.|$|E
5|$|When {{confronted with}} {{inaccuracies}} or inconsistencies, {{those who are}} suspected of perpetrating fabrications may compound the deceit by accusing forum members of imposing greater stresses upon them, exacerbating their conditions, or worsening their depression. Users may employ sockpuppets—separate online identities controlled by the same person—to accuse other forum members of disloyalty and persecution, or support the user who is under suspicion. Feldman's 1998 article in the Western Journal of Medicine notes <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{a member of a}} support group for people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome created a husband, sister-in-law, and family friend who simultaneously engaged in arguments with and about the original member; when the amount of attention directed toward the original member became inadequate, she claimed the sister-in-law committed suicide in response to the lack of support.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they had}} {{considered}} several story ideas, Heuton and Falacci wanted to feature <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> math {{was used to}} solve a traditional type of crime. They decided to base the episode on a real-life serial rapist case in which police asked Dr. Kim Rossmo {{to assist them in}} the investigation. In 1998, Rossmo, then with the Vancouver Police Department, was called in to help Lafayette, Louisiana, police investigator McCullan Gallien find the South Side Rapist. Rossmo and Gallien visited the crime scenes, and Rossmo used criminal geographic targeting, a mathematical model used to find the area in which the suspect would most likely reside. Together, Rossmo and Gallien developed a map indicating the most likely location of the rapist's residence. After DNA cleared everyone living in the area, Gallien learned that a sheriff's deputy in a neighboring department, Randy Comeaux, was a potential suspect. He had lived in the area during the time frame of the rapes but moved to a residence in the neighboring jurisdiction some time later. DNA on a cigarette butt left by Comeaux confirmed that he was the rapist, and Comeaux was arrested.|$|E

5|$|Judge Kevin McNulty {{heard the}} case on remand. After {{considering}} the parties' motions for summary judgment again, he ruled in the city's favor in 2014. Heffernan, he ruled, had not engaged in any protected speech or expressive conduct. Judge McNulty also ruled that Heffernan could not prevail on claims that his perceived speech was protected, per Ambrose v. Robinson Township, a previous case on that issue in the Third Circuit, or that his actions were protected since they aided and abetted speech. Judge McNulty also rejected similar claims for freedom of association. He decided that Dye v. Office of the Racing Commission, <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the Sixth Circuit had held that the First Amendment reached perceived political association, was not a precedent he could rely on since Dye itself explicitly rejected Ambrose, and as a district judge he could not reject circuit precedent.|$|E
