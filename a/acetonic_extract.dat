AIMS & METHODS: We aim to investigate the effects of the <b>acetonic</b> <b>extract</b> of Feijoa sellowiana fruits on the viability, proliferation, brush border membrane enzyme activities and membrane lipid peroxidation of the human intestinal epithelial cells. Caco- 2 cells were seeded into a 6 -wells multiwells plate and cultured with appropriate medium. At confluence, cells were starvated for 24 h and then exposed to the <b>acetonic</b> <b>extract</b> (500 ug/mL), for 24 h. Lactase and sucrase activity, cell proliferation and viability were measured with the modified Dahlqvist method, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay and MTT vitality test, respectively. To test membrane lipid peroxidation we used the malondialdehyde (MDA) assay; for this purpose, cells were pre-treated with H 2 O 2 (1 mM) for 2 h, with H 2 O 2 for 2 h and then the <b>acetonic</b> <b>extract</b> for 24 h or with the <b>acetonic</b> <b>extract</b> for 2 h and then H 2 O 2 for 24 h, respectively. Cells with medium alone were used as control. Data are expressed as mean±SD of 8 single experiments. RESULTS: Compared to control conditions, the <b>acetonic</b> <b>extract</b> significantly increased lactase activity (+ 7. 1 ± 1. 0 fold increase vs control, p< 0. 05) and sucrase acivity (+ 3. 2 ± 0. 7 fold increase vs control, p< 0. 05), significantly decreased proliferation (0. 17 ± 0. 01 vs 0. 23 ± 0. 01 l 450 − 540; p< 0. 05) and had no effects on cells viability. Treatment of cells with H 2 O 2 alone induceda significant increase of the MDA levels (+ 2. 3 ± 0. 3 fold increase vs control; p< 0. 05) that was not observed when the <b>acetonic</b> <b>extract</b> was added 2 h after H 2 O 2 (+ 1. 3 ± 0. 5 fold increase vs control; p= NS). Also the pre-treatment of cells with the acetonic extractdid not induced a significant increase of the MDA levels (+ 1. 5 ± 0. 4 fold increase vs control; p= NS). CONCLUSION: The treatment with the <b>acetonic</b> <b>extract</b> from Feijoa sellowiana fruits improves lactase and sucrase activity, inhibits cell proliferation, have no cytotoxic effects and prevent the H 2 O 2 -induced lipid peroxidation of human intestinal epithelial cells.

40|$|Oxidation of biomolecules such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and {{nucleic acids}} results in {{generation}} of free radicals in an organism {{which is the}} major cause of onset of various degenerative diseases. Antioxidants scavenge these free radicals, thereby protecting the cell from damage. The present {{study was designed to}} examine the free radical scavenging potential and oxidative DNA damage preventive activity of traditionally used spices Trachyspermum ammi L. (carom) and Foeniculum vulgare Mill. (fennel). The aqueous, methanolic, and <b>acetonic</b> <b>extracts</b> of T. ammi and F. vulgare seeds were prepared using soxhlet extraction assembly and subjected to qualitative and quantitative estimation of phytochemical constituents. Free radical scavenging potential was investigated using standard methods, namely, DPPH radical scavenging assay and ferric reducing antioxidant power assay along with the protection against oxidative DNA damage. The results stated that <b>acetonic</b> seed <b>extracts</b> (AAcSE and FAcSE) of both the spices possessed comparatively high amount of total phenolics whereas methanolic seed extracts (AMSE and FMSE) were found to have highest amount of total flavonoids. At 1 [*]mg/mL concentration, highest DPPH radical scavenging activity was shown by FMSE (96. 2 %), AAcSE was recorded with highest FRAP value (2270. 27 ± 0. 005 [*]μmol/L), and all the seed extracts have been shown to mitigate the damage induced by Fenton reaction on calf thymus DNA. Therefore, the study suggests that T. ammi and F. vulgare seed extracts could contribute as a highly significant bioresource of antioxidants to be used in our day-to-day life and in food and pharmaceutical industry...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to examine {{in-vitro}} antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the <b>acetonic</b> and methanolic <b>extracts</b> of the mushrooms Boletus aestivalis, Boletus edulis and Leccinum carpini. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by using free radical scavenging activity and reducing power. In addition, total content of phenol and flavonoid in extracts were determined as pyrocatechol equivalent, and as rutin equivalent, respectively. As a result of the study <b>acetonic</b> <b>extracts</b> from Boletus edulis was more powerful antioxidant activity with IC 50 value of 4. 72 μg/mL which was similar or greater than the standard antioxidants, ascorbic acid (IC 50 = 4. 22 μg/mL), BHA (IC 50 = 6. 42 μg/mL) and α-tocopherol (IC 50 = 62. 43 μg/mL). Moreover, the tested extracts had effective reducing power. A significant relationship between total phenolic and flavonoid contents and their antioxidative activities was significantly observed. The antimicrobial activity of each extract was estimated by determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration by using microdilution plate method against five species of bacteria and five species of fungi. Generally, the tested mushroom extracts had relatively strong antimicrobial activity against the tested microorganisms. The minimum inhibitory concentration for both extracts related to the tested bacteria and fungi were 1. 25 - 10 mg/ mL. The present study shows that tested mushroom species demonstrated a strong antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. It suggests that mushroom may be used as good sources of natural antioxidants and for pharmaceutical purposes in treating of various deseases...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{products}} {{are widely used}} as traditional medicines and are a common source of bioactive molecules {{for the treatment of}} bacterial infections. In particular, some plants of the genus Plectranthus (Lamiaceae) have demonstrated several applications, including the treatment of various infections. In this work, aqueous, acetonic and methanolic extracts of P. madagascariensis and P. neochilus were prepared using several extraction methods (infusion, decoction, maceration, microwave- and ultrasoundassisted and supercritical fluids). All extracts were screened for their antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Mycobacterium smegmatis) and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) and two yeast (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strains. The P. madagascariensis acetonic extracts obtained using ultrasound and maceration methods and P. neochilus <b>acetonic</b> <b>extract</b> obtained by ultrasound technique showed activity against the five tested Gram positive bacteria (5 ‒ 24 mm of inhibition zone using the well diffusion test). The antimicrobial activity was further evaluated by the microdilution method (MIC values were between 250 ‒ 0. 49 μg/mL) and the bioautography assay against S. aureus. The P. madagascariensis ultrasound <b>acetonic</b> <b>extract</b> was the most active extract against all the tested Gram positive bacteria (MIC values ranged between 31. 25 - 0. 49 μg/mL). It was also active against resistant MRSA and VRE strains (MIC values ranged between 31. 25 - 0. 98 μg/mL). The S. aureus bioautography assay showed that the more polar compounds were the responsible for the antimicrobial activity...|$|E

The aim of the present work was to improve and validate the HPLC-CUPRAC postcolumn method {{for the evaluation of}} active antioxidant markers from the <b>acetonic</b> <b>extracts</b> of Ginkgo biloba leaves. Improvement of the HPLC online assay was performed by evaluating the suitable loop temperature, the reaction loop length, and the impact of flow rate. Separation of the analytes was performed by the HPLC method on an ACE C 18 analytical column using a gradient elution program. The separated antioxidant markers in the extracts reacted with copper(II) -neocuproine (Cu(II) -Nc) reagent in the postcolumn reaction coil. The reagent was reduced by antioxidants to the copper(I) -neocuproine (Cu(I) -Nc) chelate with a maximum absorption at 450 nm. Validation experiments confirmed sufficient precision, sensitivity, and effectiveness of the corresponding method, which could be used for further evaluations of active antioxidant compounds in similar plant materials. 1...|$|R
40|$|Euphorbia is a genus {{of plants}} {{belonging}} to the family Euphorbiaceae, consisting of about 2160 species. This family occurs mainly in the Indo-Malayan region and tropical America. Euphorbia also has many species in non-tropical {{areas such as the}} Mediterranean area, the Middle East, South Africa, and southern USA. Phytochemical studies of species from the genus Euphorbia report the presence of skin-irritating and tumor-promoting diterpenoids, several macrocyclic diterpenoids with antibacterial, anticancer, PGE 2 -inhibitory, antifeedant, anti-HIV, and analgesic activities. Some of the Euphorbiaceae species are used in folk medicine for the treatment of skin diseases, gonorrhea, migraines, intestinal parasites, and as a purgative. Euphorbia bivonae Steudel is distributed in Southern Italy, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Lebanon, and Palestine. There are no previous phytochemical studies reported in the literature on the chemical composition of the aerial parts. This paper concerns the determination of fatty acid components by GC-MS, the isolation of triterpene and coumarin constituents by chromatographic purification, and the antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities (by microdilution assays) of the <b>acetonic</b> <b>extracts</b> of Euphorbia bivonae stem and leaf.

40|$|The {{composition}} of the essential oils of fruits from Feijoa sellowiana grown {{in the district of}} Acerra is compared with those collected from unpolluted sites. Essential oils from the fruits of F. sellowiana were analysed by GC/MS. Sixty compounds, representing 96. 6 % and 97. 8 % (unpolluted site and Acerra site, respectively) of the oils, were identified. The major constituents were β-caryophyllene (12. 4 % and 16. 8 %), ledene (9. 6 % and 11. 1 %), α-humulene (6. 3 % and 8. 2 %), β-elemene (4. 9 % and 5. 3 %) and δ-cadinene (4. 7 % and 5. 2 %) in the control site and Acerra site, respectively. The antioxidant components were increased in response to polluted condition. The <b>acetonic</b> <b>extracts</b> of F. sellowiana from both sites were purified to obtain flavone, the compound responsible for antitumoral and antioxidant activity. The amount of the antioxidant flavone was higher in the Acerra site than the control site.
