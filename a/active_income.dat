In essence, the Obama proposals (the “Obama Plan”) introduce a 21 st Century version of the vision begun by Thomas Adams in 1918 and continued by Stanley Surrey in 1961 : A world in which source and residence taxation are coordinated so as to achieve the underlying goals of the international tax regime. As I have explained at length elsewhere, these goals are the Single Tax Principle (all income from cross-border transactions {{should be subject to}} tax once, not more and not less) and the Benefits Principle (<b>active</b> <b>income</b> should be taxed primarily at source, passive income primarily at residence). The Obama Plan does this by addressing the central problem of implementing corporate and individual income taxation in a world of open economies: Effective source taxation requires residence taxation, and effective residence taxation requires source taxation.

40|$|In 1997, I {{wrote an}} article on the {{international}} tax challenges posed by the then-nascent electronic commerce, in which I suggested that the international tax regime is based on two principles: the benefits principle and the single tax principle. The benefits principle states that active (business) income should be taxed primarily by the country of source, and passive (investment) income should be taxed primarily by the country of residence. This is the famous compromise reached by the four economists at the foundation of the regime in 1923 and is not particularly controversial. It is embodied in every one of the over 3, 000 tax treaties that reduce taxation at the source of passive income while allowing source countries to tax <b>active</b> <b>income</b> if there is a permanent establishment. The single tax principle states that cross-border income should be taxed once at the rate determined by the benefits principle. In other words, cross-border income should be taxed only once at the source-country rate for <b>active</b> <b>income</b> and at the residence-country rate for passive income. But if the preferred country (i. e., source for active, and residence for passive) does not tax, it is incumbent upon the other country to do so because otherwise, I argued in my article, double non-taxation would result, which is just as damaging as double taxation. This argument remains hugely controversial. While there are indications that the single tax principle was the idea underlying the adoption of the foreign tax credit by the United States in 1918, as far as tax treaties are concerned, the United States did not accept the single tax principle until more recent times...|$|E

40|$|The Financial Crisis of 2008 and Great Recession that {{followed}} have exacerbated income inequality {{within and between}} countries. In {{the aftermath of the}} economic turbulence, politicians have turned their attention to the twin problems of individual tax evasion and corporate tax avoidance. U. S. legislators enacted the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FACTA), leading to the United States signing a series of Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs) for the exchange of tax information. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) developed the Multilateral Agreement for Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MAATM) and initiated the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project to reduce tax evasion and tax avoidance globally. Although these efforts were well-intended, this Article argues that the tax policy response to the Financial Crisis and Great Recession has ultimately been inadequate. The problem, which is discussed in-depth in the sections that follow, is the benefits principle. Part I of this Article introduces the primary weakness of the benefits principle: the reliance on source-based taxation for <b>active</b> <b>income</b> and residencebased taxation for passive income requires cooperation by too many jurisdictions. This section provides three case studies of individual tax evasion and corporate tax avoidance to illustrate the principle’s shortcomings. Part II focuses on the individual tax evasion problem. This section analyzes the FATCA, IGA, and MAATM responses and explains why these measures are likely to fall short. Part III focuses on corporate tax avoidance. This section examines the BEPS response and its inadequacies. Part IV proposes an alternative to international tax policy based on the benefits principle.

By merging these two benefits, the government gives up the logic of specific policy for low-income single parents with young children. To assess the empirical relevance of inactivity traps that single parents living on transfer income face, we used data from the DREES survey covering a sample of the RMI or API recipients. The survey was conducted in May-June 2008 when the rSa was tested in some areas. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the study population in terms of socio-demographic characteristics, earlier career paths and career paths during the observation period (October 2007 -May 2008).

40|$|ABSTRACT This thesis {{analyses}} {{whether the}} existing international framework for allocation {{of rights to}} tax <b>active</b> business <b>income</b> can be considered fair or equitable {{from the perspective of}} Brazil, India, and China (the BICs) and suggests steps that could be taken in the short and medium terms to advance fairness. Chapter I highlights the challenges in the framework {{from the standpoint of the}} BICs and also other developing countries. It is argued that an understanding of these concerns is important to achieve the OECDâs Base Erosion and Profit Shifting projectâs aim of a certain and stable arrangement. Chapter II contends that fairness in both the rule-making process and the rules is critical to this end. Chapters III-V examine the evolution and development of the prevailing rules for division of rights to tax <b>active</b> business <b>income</b> and the key aspects of these rules from the BICsâ perspective based on the parameters for assessing procedural and substantive fairness established in chapter II. It is discussed that the BICs either had no or ineffective participation in the formulation of these rules. Resultantly, the BICs diverge from some of the basics of the rules towards positions that better account for these countriesâ contributions in the generation of global profits. Chapter VI proposes enhancing the authority and legitimacy of the UNâs Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters as both a short and medium term option for fairer international taxation rule-making for the BICs, and, importantly, other developing countries as well. Chapter VII suggests a significant economic presence test for nexus along with a low rate withholding tax, and the greater use of the profit split method as steps towards a fairer allocation of taxing rights from the perspective of the BICs. Further analysis of theoretically superior but longer-term alternatives, such as global formulary apportionment, is also recommended...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{performed by the}} authors has proven {{that the rate of}} growth of the <b>active</b> <b>income</b> of residents of the Rostov region is far behind the rate of growth of the value of residential properties. There is no need to wait for any improvement in the welfare of Russians, rather, more houses need to be built and new financing patterns are to be implemented in respect of construction sites that are going to accommodate residential housing construction projects. Given that the number of families affluent enough to buy housing is equal to 11. 5 %in the Rostov region, resolution of the housing problem needs a comprehensive approach. Analysis of the value of land in the Rostov region proves that investment projects that contemplate low rise housing construction in the cottage communities or areas with low values of land, i. e. the areas selected by low-income citizens, should be treated as projects that need state funding. Favorable conditions for citizens wishing to build or to buy private low rise houses could be part of the “stimulus. ”The authors have developed an improved mortgage lending pattern that incorporates programmes of incentives, supplementary social security payments, and a lower interest rate.

40|$|The {{deregulation}} of major world economies led to increased globalisation of enterprises which provided opportunities for New Zealand and Australian taxpayers to expand or move their businesses offshore. The globalisation brought niche opportunities for businesses to develop profitable offshore operations. The growth in offshore investments triggered {{the problems associated}} with the erosion of the New Zealand and Australian tax base. The risk in New Zealand was identified by the Labour led Government in the early 1980 ’s; when New Zealand entities began investing in tax haven countries to take advantage of lower tax rates in these countries. As a result in late 1980 ’s, New Zealand and Australia introduced offshore investment rules. The reasons for the introductions of the offshore investment rules by the two countries were similar, but the rules differed in a number of ways. One of the main differences was that New Zealand did not differentiate between active and passive activities. On the other hand, the Australian tax rules exempt active business activities carried out offshore. Recently, the New Zealand Government announced that it is reviewing the Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) rules and like Australia, New Zealand CFC rules would exempt <b>active</b> <b>income</b> from tax; and only passive income would attract income tax.

40|$|President Barack Obama {{proposes to}} {{translate}} his rhetoric directed against "tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas" into new tax measures that will penalize investment abroad by US-based multinational corporations (MNCs). Hufbauer and Kim {{believe that the}} United States should not try to constrain the overseas operations of these firms. Instead, the United States should reform its enormously complex tax system at home and create a business-friendly environment. Tax reform should be designed to boost both the domestic and international activities of US-based MNCs and bring more foreign investment to American shores. To that end, tax reform should target fundamental issues rather than populist sound bites. The United States maintains a complicated tax system with multiple loopholes but accompanied by high statutory corporate rates, at about 39 percent (federal plus state). Team Obama should simplify the corporate tax regime and lower the federal marginal (i. e., statutory) tax rate to 25 percent or less. The United States should also adopt a territorial approach to the taxation of "active income" earned by foreign operations of US-based MNCs. In other words, the United States should end any US taxation of <b>active</b> <b>income</b> earned by subsidiaries operating abroad. Shifting from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system would ensure that the United States remains an attractive location for MNC headquarters [...] since the active business income of foreign subsidiaries {{would no longer be}} subjected to a residual US corporate tax.

40|$|The Discussion Draft of the “Tax Reform Act of 2014 ” (TRA 14) {{released}} by US House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R-MI) on February 26, 2014 represents {{a major effort}} for fundamental and far reaching reform of US tax law. Unfortunately, while {{many parts of the}} proposal seem quite sensible as an effort to bring back the “spirit of 1986 ”, the international tax reform proposals are deeply flawed and based on obsolete assumptions on the world facing US multinationals in 2014. Overall, TRA 14 represents a welcome effort to propose a revenue neutral combination of base broadening and rate cutting. TRA 14 envisages three individual rates of 10 %, 25 % and 35 % and a corporate rate of 25 %. This rate structure is quite sensible, and if it can be achieved in a revenue neutral fashion that is an added advantage. However, the international tax proposals are {{based on the assumption that}} because most other OECD countries have adopted a limited version of territoriality, i. e., a “participation exemption” for dividends out of the <b>active</b> <b>income</b> of Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs), the US must follow suit to preserve the competitiveness of US based MNEs. But this assumption is wrong, for three reasons. First, the empirical data indicate that under current law US based MNEs do not face a competitive disadvantage despite the fact that they are nominally taxed on a worldwide basis without a participation exemption. Second, the OECD BEPS project suggests that the effective tax rates of foreign MNEs are headed up, not down. Third and most importantly, reducing the US corporate tax can be done without putting US-based MNEs at a competitive disadvantage even if deferral were completely eliminated, and this has the added advantage of eliminating both lock out (the main problem the participation exemption is designed to solve) and the incentive to shift profits out of the US (which this version of TRA 14 does little to address). This paper will discuss these points and conclude that as far as the international proposals are concerned it would be better to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch with a simple proposal of full inclusion at whatever corporate rate is judged to be similar to the effective rates paid by foreign-based MNEs...|$|E
