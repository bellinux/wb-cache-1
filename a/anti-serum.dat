5000|$|Serological Evidence: In recent years, {{experiments}} made in {{the composition}} of blood offer good evidence for evolution. It has been found that blood can be transmitted only between animals that are closely related. The degree of relationship between these animals is determined by {{what is known as the}} serological evidence. There are various methods of doing so; the method employed by George Nuttall is called the precipitation method. In this method, <b>anti-serum</b> of the involved animals has to be prepared. For human study, human blood is collected and allowed to clot. Then, the serum is separated from the erythrocytes. A rabbit is then injected with a small amount of serum at regular intervals, which is allowed to incubate for a few days. This forms antibodies in the rabbit's body. The rabbit's blood is then drawn and clotted. The serum separated from the red blood cells is called the anti-human serum.|$|E

The therapeutic effect of the rabbit anti-G 17 :DT <b>anti-serum</b> was evaluated on a freshly derived human colorectal cancer cell line, AP 5, which was shown to express both gastrin receptors and gastrin immunoreactivity as assessed by immunocytochemistry. Rabbit anti-G 17 :DT <b>anti-serum</b> was shown to block basal in vitro growth of AP 5 cells when used at an antigen binding capacity of 3. 75 x 10 (- 9) M. The same dilution of <b>anti-serum</b> completely reversed growth stimulated by human G 17 at concentrations of 1 x 10 (- 10) and 1 x 10 (- 9) M but did not inhibit growth at 1 x 10 (- 8) M G 17. When AP 5 was grown as a xenograft in nude mice, the sensitivity to the proliferative effect of human G 17 was maintained. In addition, the basal growth of AP 5 xenografts was significantly reduced by i. v. infusion of rabbit anti-G 17 :DT <b>anti-serum</b> when compared to treatment with rabbit anti:DT control <b>anti-serum.</b> Thus anti-G 17 :DT antibodies raised by Gastrimmune may be of clinical value in gastrin-sensitive tumours...|$|E
40|$|Initial {{experiments}} {{performed in}} this study allowed species differentiation of Globodera pallida and G. rostochiensis following immunoblotting with the lectin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and the monoclonal antibody TEPC 15. Further studies were aimed at the isolation of amphidial secretions. Two methods of collecting secretions were attempted, one involving the modification of a previously described staining method, the other relying on the collection of ES products from living, sterile nematodes. Secretions collected from G. pallida using the two different methods were analysed using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Secretions were also used for <b>anti-serum</b> production, giving two anti-sera, Luffness <b>anti-serum</b> and ES <b>anti-serum.</b> These were subsequently used for immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence studies. Indirect immunofluorescence studies indicated that the two anti-sera recognised different nematode components. This was further confirmed by immunoblotting studies which revealed that Luffness <b>anti-serum</b> recognised a number of nematode proteins, and was capable of differentiating both between and with species of G. pallida and G. rostochiensis. In contrast, ES <b>anti-serum</b> recognised only two proteins which appeared to be conserved between the two species. Observations also indicated that presence of a nematode lectin component present in amphidial secretions with apparent specificity for N-acetylgalactosamine. Experiments were also performed to examine different methods of inducing secretions.

40|$|By intraperitoneally injecting {{to normal}} guinea pigs the {{antiserum}} of bone marrow {{obtained from the}} normal rabbits to which the intraperitoneal injection of the guinea-pig bone marrow had been previously given, the author studied {{the changes in the}} peripheral blood and bone-marrow pictures in these guinea pigs; and arrived at the following conclusions: 1. By the intraperitoneal injection of bone-marrow <b>anti-serum</b> a transient hyperchromic anemia can be recognized in the test guinea pigs. Namely, the number of erythrocytes and the hemoglobin (Hb) content are decreased, and anisocytosis, erythroblasts, polychromatic erythrocytes, and the erythrocytes possessing basophilic spots are recognized. Reticulocytes have been found to have increased in some of the test animals. 2. The number of leucocytes fluctuates with the injection of the <b>anti-serum</b> of bone marrow, and in the relatively greater number of animals leucocytes tend to decrease at first and later increase. In the leucocyte percentage, a decrease in pseudoeosinophils, and an increase in lymphocytes can be observed in most of animals, and also eosinophils increase in number. Besides these, the appearance cf young granulocytes such as myelocytes and metamyelocytes as well as the regressive degeneration of various leucocyte cells can be recognized. 3. Platelets are decreased in number in all cases with the injection of bone-marrow <b>anti-serum.</b> 4. As for the bone-marrow picture in the majority of the test guinea pigs the interferance with the production of erythroblasts can be observed, and in some of the test animals the impairment of maturation of erythroblasts and {{in another part of the}} test animals the left shift of nuclei in pseudo-eosinophils can be seen. 5.

40|$|Numerous {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} {{for the detection of}} hypoxic cells using nitroimidazoles labelled with both radioactive and stable isotopes where the isotopic label becomes bound as a result of reductive metabolism of the nitro group.

Bioreduction of the nitroimidazole leads to binding of bioreductive metabolites, and hence the theophylline side-chain, to intracellular molecules. Immunochemical procedures are then used to stain cells containing the bound theophylline using an FITC-conjugated <b>anti-serum.</b> Flow cytometric analysis of stained cells is facilitated by co-staining cellular DNA, which allows discrimination of single cells in the sample and rejection of cell clumps and debris.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{antibody}} to co-operate with certain non-immune lymphoid {{cells in the}} rejection of tumours has been studied both in vitro and in vivo. <b>Anti-serum</b> raised in rabbits against a PVGc rat leukosis can be rendered “tumour specific” by in vivo absorption in normal PVGc rats and this antiserum can be shown to have lymphocyte dependent antibody (LDA) activity against the tumour cell in vitro.

MT purified from the bacterial suspension showed one polypeptide with a molecular weight of 7 kDa by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Tricine-SDS-PAGE). Western-blotting confirmed the polypeptides had a specific reactivity with mouse polyclonal MT <b>anti-serum.</b> Based on the purified MT and MT <b>anti-serum,</b> the reaction parameters for an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were developed. The direct coating ELISA showed a higher linear relationship compared to antibody sandwich coating ELISA. The optimal dilution rates of purified MT <b>anti-serum</b> and coating period were shown to be 1 : 160, 000 and 12 hours at 4 °C. At 37 °C, the appropriate reaction duration of the first antibody and the second antibody were 2 hours and 1 hour, respectively. According to these optimal parameters, the standard linear equation, y = 0. 0032 x + 0. 1769 (R 2 = 0. 9779, x, y representing MT concentration and OD 450 value), was established for the determination of MT concentration with a valid range of 3. 9 - 500 ng/ml. In verification experiments, the mean coefficients of variation of the intra-assay and inter-assay were 3. 260 % and 3. 736 %, respectively.

40|$|By {{screening}} a Trichomonas vaginalis λgt 11 cDNA {{library with}} <b>anti-serum</b> raised against a purified preparation of T. vaginalis cell-detaching factor (CDF), two clones were identified. Molecular {{analysis of the}} cDNA sequences indicated that the clones were distinct and could potentially represent two unique T. vaginalis genes. Further characterization of the CDF <b>anti-serum</b> used in the initial library screening indicated that the serum possessed reactivity to CDF {{and a variety of}} other T. vaginalis proteins. The multiple specificities of the <b>anti-serum</b> are likely to have contributed to the identification of the two distinct cDNA clones. While the relationship between the weaker of the two immunoreactive cDNA sequences (CDF- 2) and the CDF protein was unclear, the results of Northern hybridization and sequence analysis suggested that the strongly reactive CDF- 1 clone did not contain sequences representing a CDF gene. Since the CDF- 1 cDNA clone contained an almost complete coding sequence and because the encoded polypeptide exhibited significant protein sequence similarity to bacterial N-acetylneuraminate (Neu 5 Ac) lyases, this T. vaginalis sequence was further analyzed. Using the cDNA sequence and cloned segments of overlapping genomic DNA, the complete coding and flanking regions of this T. vaginalis gene, designated TvnanA, were determined. TvnanA is a single copy gene that lacks introns and contains a 954 bp open-reading frame that is predicted to encode a 318 amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 35 kDa. The gene is transcribed as a single 1. 1 kb polyadenylated mRNA with short 5 ' (17 - 18 nt) and 3 ' (28 nt) untranslated regions.
