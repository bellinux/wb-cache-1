Afterwards, McKenna reveals that she knows <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Polaroid Man who kidnapped Black weeks earlier. Means {{receives}} a vision herself during the conversation, and becomes convinced that McKenna is a prophet of some sort. Black thinks the girl is acting out, but Means reveals that she is reciting passages from the non-canonical Gnostic Gospels, which supposed that Mary Magdalene was the only disciple to fully understand the teachings of Jesus Christ. Means believes the girls are not seeing visions of Saint Mary, but of Mary Magdalene.|$|E

As a result, ancient Egyptian artifacts provide sometimes conflicting and inconclusive evidence of the ethnicity {{of the people who}} lived in Egypt during dynastic times.|$|E

There has also been increasing awareness of tumour heterogeneity, or genetic diversity within a single tumour. Among other prospects, these discoveries raise the possibility of finding that drugs that have not given good results applied to a general population of cases may yet be successful for a proportion of cases with particular genetic profiles.|$|E

Despite his old age and being human, Mihai has skills that equate or even exceed most of the cast. However, Mihai has a terrible sense of {{direction}} and has a constant run of bad luck. He and Badou share a close bond along with Kiri and Mimi, and also shares concern for Heine and Naoto.

25|$|One {{important}} tool {{in this effort}} was HUD's first-ever Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. This groundbreaking survey of homelessness found that 704,000 people nationwide sought shelter {{at least once in}} a three-month period.

Rutherford then sailed to Brisbane and travelled overland back to Melbourne and on the way learnt <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> country, and much about its horses, in which he traded for some years. The coaching business of Cobb and Co., which had been founded by some visitors from America a few years before, was in 1857 in the hands of Cyrus Hewitt and George Watson, who employed Rutherford to manage the Beechworth line. In 1861 Rutherford formed a syndicate (including Walter Russell Hall) and bought out Hewitt and Watson for the sum of £23,000.|$|E

500|$|Handel's biographer Jonathan Keates writes that: [...] "From [...] Handel {{learned not}} only <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> line {{and shape of}} an aria, about strong, adventurous bass lines and solid choral writing, but also about those delicacies of {{instrumental}} colouring which he later perfected in his own style". Handel's musical development also benefited from an early and lasting friendship with Georg Philipp Telemann, whom he met in 1700. In February 1702 Handel enrolled at the University of Halle, perhaps intending to study law. In March he took up the post of organist at Halle's Calvinist cathedral (Domkirche), a prestigious appointment for one so young and indicative of his burgeoning musical reputation in the city.|$|E
500|$|Although {{they came}} to learn <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game, neither Kotok nor McCarthy were known as chess players. Mikhail Botvinnik, three times world chess champion, wrote in his book Computers, Chess and Long-Range Planning that the Kotok–McCarthy program's [...] "rule for rejecting moves was so {{constituted}} that the machine threw the baby out with the bath water." [...] The program drew criticism from Richard Greenblatt, who later wrote Mac Hack, which beat a person in tournament play, and more recently, from Hans Berliner, when he looked back on it in 2005. During the Cold War, Kotok-McCarthy played (and lost to) the best Russian chess program in the first match between computer programs.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{satellite}} tracking is teaching scientists <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way albatrosses forage {{across the ocean}} to find food. They undertake no annual migration, but disperse widely after breeding—Southern Hemisphere species often undertake [...] trips. There is also evidence of separate ranges for different species at sea. A comparison of the foraging niches of two related species that breed on Campbell Island, the Campbell albatross and the grey-headed albatross, showed the Campbell albatross primarily fed over the Campbell Plateau whereas the grey-headed albatross fed in more pelagic, oceanic waters. Wandering albatrosses also react strongly to bathymetry, feeding only in waters deeper than 1000m (3281ft); so rigidly did the satellite plots match this contour that one scientist remarked, [...] "It almost appears as if the birds notice and obey a 'No Entry' sign where the water shallows to less than 1000m". There is also evidence of different ranges for the two sexes of the same species; a study of Tristan albatrosses breeding on Gough Island showed that males foraged {{to the west of}} Gough and females to the east.|$|E

In 1912 Coward also {{appeared}} at the Savoy Theatre in An Autumn Idyll (as a dancer in the ballet) and at the London Coliseum in A Little Fowl Play, by Harold Owen, in which Hawtrey starred. Italia Conti engaged Coward to appear at the Liverpool Repertory Theatre in 1913, {{and in the same}} year he was cast as the Lost Boy Slightly in Peter Pan. He reappeared in Peter Pan the following year, and in 1915 he was again in Where the Rainbow Ends. He worked with other child actors in this period, including Hermione Gingold (whose mother threatened to turn [...] "that naughty boy" [...] out); Fabia Drake; Esmé Wynne, with whom he collaborated on his earliest plays; Alfred Willmore, later known as Micheál Mac Liammóir; and Gertrude Lawrence who, Coward wrote in his memoirs, [...] "gave me an orange and told me a few mildly dirty stories, and I loved her from then onwards." ...|$|E
