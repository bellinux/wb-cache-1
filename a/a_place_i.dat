Having visited the country many times as a youth, he remarked that after reading about the profits to be made from tobacco he [...] "suddenly got a rush of blood to the crotch about the tobacco boom and decided I was going to go up there and make the family fortune in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> liked and wanted to be in." [...] He welcomed the move as it allowed him to indulge his hobby of big game hunting: in that year in Angola, then under Portuguese rule, he set a world record for the biggest {{elephant}} shot, which stood until 1955.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Rollins {{admitted}} a {{disdain for}} rehashing old {{music for the}} sake of it - [...] "I don’t want to play old music. To me, it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, I see no courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again. If others want to, that’s for them. For myself, I have to move on. Life is too short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done." [...] On the same topic, Henry more recently said in 2016 [...] "For me, music was a time and <b>a</b> <b>place.</b> <b>I</b> never really enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. One day, I woke up, and I didn’t have any more lyrics. I just had nothing to contribute to the form, and I was done with band practice and travelling in groups." ...|$|E

2500|$|O'Keeffe {{then spent}} part of nearly every year working in New Mexico. She {{collected}} rocks and bones from the desert floor and made them and the distinctive architectural and landscape forms of the area subjects in her work. Known as a loner, O'Keeffe explored the land she loved often in her Ford Model A, which she purchased and learned to drive in 1929. She often talked about her fondness for Ghost Ranch and Northern New Mexico, as in 1943, when she explained: [...] "Such a beautiful, untouched lonely feeling place, such a fine part of what I call the 'Faraway'. It is <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> have painted before ... even now I must do it again." ...|$|E
2500|$|After another NFL {{championship}} game appearance for the Browns and Pro Bowl season for Warfield in 1969, he {{was traded to}} the Miami Dolphins for the third pick in the 1970 draft. The trade came as a shock to Warfield, who had established himself as one of the Browns' most popular players. [...] "I have to admit going to Miami was not <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> desired to go," [...] said Warfield 30 years later. The Browns used the pick acquired in the trade on Purdue University quarterback Mike Phipps. The trade {{is considered one of the}} most lopsided in NFL history, as Phipps had only limited success for the Browns, while Warfield was a major factor in the Dolphins' championships in the early 1970s.|$|E

2500|$|Cornell {{publicly}} {{talked about}} his struggle with depression, isolation and suicidal thoughts several times throughout his life. Following Cornell's death, his brother Peter started a campaign to raise awareness on depression and suicide prevention. [...] "Maybe we can help spare another family the devastation", Peter shared on his social media. A few days later, Peter revealed {{that he was being}} bullied and threatened to change the narrative of this awareness message; [...] "Change the message or just drop it entirely. It has reached a point where my own mental health, my sobriety and the safety of my family are at risk. And this bullying is coming from <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> never could have imagined", he shared before telling that he would remove himself from social media and asking his followers to keep the conversation and break through this stigma.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking in {{reference}} to the show, Wallace commented, [...] "I have always loved working on EastEnders so when I heard of this new drama to take Kat and Alfie outside of Walford, I couldn't believe our luck. To be exploring the next chapter for Kat as well as working alongside my best mate, Shane, is a dream come true and a huge compliment." [...] Richie said, [...] "Both Jessie and I are absolutely thrilled to be given this amazing opportunity. To have a whole drama focused around Kat and Alfie is a huge honour for us both and we just can't wait to start filming." [...] Treadwell-Collins later spoke again about the new series: [...] "We want to create something big around [...] EastEnders as a brand can afford to do it and I've always wanted to do something like that. I'm from Ireland originally, so it's <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> know well. Shane's Irish, Jessie’s half Irish—so, there’s an Irish connection between all of us. The other important thing about the spin-off show is it's not just about Kat and Alfie—we've created a whole new world and a new lot of characters. The writers have created a really lovely, interesting world, but also with our style of storytelling." [...] EastEnders previously had a storyline set in Ireland in 1997, which was heavily criticised for its unflattering depiction of Irish life, but Richie stated the series would not parody Irish life or [...] "play the dopey card".|$|E

Presley would nevertheless publicly cite his debt to African American music, pointing to artists such as B. B. King, Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup, Ivory Joe Hunter, and Fats Domino. The reporter who conducted Presley's first interview in New York City in 1956 noted that he named blues singers who [...] "obviously {{meant a lot to}} him. [...] was very surprised to hear him talk about the black performers down there and about how he tried to carry on their music." [...] Later that year in Charlotte, North Carolina, Presley was quoted as saying: [...] "The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I’m doin' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it no mind 'til I goosed it up. I got it from them. Down in Tupelo, Mississippi, I used to hear old Arthur Crudup bang his box the way I do now and I said if I ever got to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] Little Richard said of Presley: [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music." [...] B. B. King said he began to respect Presley after he did Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup material and that after he met him, he thought the singer really was something else and was someone whose music was growing all the time right up to his death.|$|E
