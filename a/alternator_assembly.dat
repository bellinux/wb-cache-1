For example, Zephyr Energy Corporation’s patented Windbeam micro generator captures energy from airflow to recharge batteries and power electronic devices. The Windbeam’s novel design {{allows it to}} operate silently in wind speeds as low as 2mph. The generator consists of a lightweight beam suspended by durable long-lasting springs within an outer frame. The beam oscillates rapidly when exposed to airflow due {{to the effects of}} multiple fluid flow phenomena. A linear <b>alternator</b> <b>assembly</b> converts the oscillating beam motion into usable electrical energy. A lack of bearings and gears eliminates frictional inefficiencies and noise. The generator can operate in low-light environments unsuitable for solar panels (e.g. HVAC ducts) and is inexpensive due to low cost components and simple construction. The scalable technology can be optimized to satisfy the energy requirements and design constraints of a given application.|$|E

5000|$|The M734 Fuze was {{developed}} at the Harry Diamond Laboratories (HDL) for the 60mm [...] Lightweight Company Mortar System, which now is managed by the Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) Fuze Division. [...] It {{was determined to be}} suitable for army use in July 1977 and accordingly Type Classification Standard. To demonstrate readiness for transition into Full Rate Production by the Armament Munitions & Chemical Command (AMCCOM), ARDEC/HDL managed the first production for war reserves as well as the construction of automated Initial Production Facilities (IPF) for mobilization readiness. HDL awarded three competitive contracts in 1978/79: Eastman Kodak (Rochester, NY) for the Fuze Assembly and IPF, Motorola (Scottsdale, AZ) for the Amplifier Assembly and IPF, and Alinabal (Milford, CT.) for the <b>Alternator</b> <b>Assembly</b> and IPF. After successful First Article Inspection and production Lot Acceptance tests, transition was completed in March 1983. AMCCOM performed all procurements for stockpile with technical support by ARDEC. The Army Mortar Plan issued in 1985 expanded use of the M734 fuze to 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm mortars (Figures 8,9). The initial production costs and required operating characteristics are shown in Figures 10 and 11 respectively. Improvements in the fuze reliability and performance by ARDEC engineers led to production of the M734A1 fuze [...] manufactured by L-3 FOS (Formerly KDI).|$|E

The high temperature linear alternator is {{a modified version of}} that used in Sunpowers Advanced Stirling Convertor (ASC), and is capable of operation at temperatures up to 200 C. Increasing the temperature capability of the linear alternator could expand the mission space of future Stirling RPS designs. High temperature Neodymium-Iron-Boron (Nd-Fe-B) magnets were selected for the HTLA application, and were fully characterized and tested prior to uses. Higher temperature epoxy for <b>alternator</b> <b>assembly</b> was also selected and tested for thermal stability and strength. A characterization test was performed on the HTLA to measure its performance at various amplitudes, loads, and temperatures. HTLA endurance testing at 200 C is currently underway...|$|E

40|$|Motion {{planning}} in robotics {{is a process}} to compute a collision free path between the initial and final configuration among obstacles. To plan a collision free path in the workspace, it would need to plan the motion of every point of its shaping according its degree of freedom. The motion of robot between obstacles is represented by a path in configuration space. It is an imaginary concept. Motion planning is aimed at enabling robots with capabilities of automatically deciding and executing a sequence motion {{in order to achieve}} a task without ollision with other objects in a given environment. Motion {{planning in}} a robot workspace for robotic assembly depends on sequence of parts or the order they are arranged to produce a robotic assembly product obeying all the constraints and instability of base assembly movement. If the number of parts increases the sequencing becomes difficult and hence the path planning. As multiple no. of paths are possible, the path is considered to be optimal when it minimizes the travelling time while satisfying the process constraint. For this purpose, it is necessary to select appropriate optimization technique for optimization of paths. Such types of problem can be solved by metaheuristic methods. The present work utilizes ACO for the generation of optimal motion planning sequence. The present algorithm is based on ant's behavior, pheromone update & pheromone evaporation and is used to enhance the local search. This procedure is applied to a grinder assembly, driver assembly and car <b>alternator</b> <b>assembly.</b> Two robots like adept-one and puma- 762 are selected for picking and placing operation of parts in their workspace. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{ever-increasing}} global {{energy demand}} and the mounting environmental concerns {{caused by the}} increasing consumption of fossil fuels call {{for more and more}} utilisation of sustainable energy sources such as biomass. Many medium- and large-scale biomass-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plants have been demonstrated and commercialised {{in many parts of the}} world, such as several European countries and China. However, few biomass-fuelled micro-scale CHP (1 – 10 kWe) systems suitable for domestic applications have been demonstrated or commercialised. This paper presents the preliminary results of an experimental investigation on the biomass-fired organic Rankine cycle (ORC) -based micro-CHP system currently developed by the authors. The biomass-fired ORC-based micro-CHP system mainly consists of a biomass boiler, an evaporator, an ORC expander, an alternator, a heat recuperator and a condenser. The heat of biomass combustion in the boiler is used to generate hot water, which is then used to heat and vaporise the organic working fluid through the evaporator. The organic fluid vapour drives the expander to rotate an alternator, producing power. The expanded organic fluid vapour leaving the expander first passes through the heat recuperator and then is condensed in the condenser. The cooling water leaving the condenser can be heated to a temperature (∼ 46 °C) suitable for domestic washing and under-floor heating etc. Testing results of the micro-CHP system with a 50 kWth biomass-pellet boiler are analysed and presented in this paper. The current micro-CHP generated 861 W electricity and 47. 26 kWth heat, corresponding to electricity generation efficiency of 1. 41 % and CHP efficiency of 78. 69 %. Further improvements on the performance of the expander and the <b>alternator</b> <b>assembly</b> as well as the design of the biomass boiler’s heat exchanger need to be addressed in the future...|$|E
