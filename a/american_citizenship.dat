5|$|Some Black Hebrews renounced their <b>American</b> <b>citizenship</b> to try {{to prevent}} more deportations. In 1990, Illinois legislators helped {{negotiate}} an agreement that resolved the Black Hebrews' legal status in Israel. Members of the group are permitted to work and have access to housing and social services. The Black Hebrews reclaimed their <b>American</b> <b>citizenship</b> and have received aid from the U.S. government, which helped them build a school and additional housing. In 2003 the agreement was revised, and the Black Hebrews were granted permanent residency in Israel.|$|E

5|$|As {{its first}} {{enforcement}} legislation, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing black <b>Americans</b> <b>citizenship</b> and {{equal protection of}} the law, though not the right to vote. The amendment was also used as authorizing several Freedmen's Bureau bills. President Andrew Johnson vetoed these bills, but Congress overrode his vetoes to pass the Civil Rights Act and the Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill.|$|R

5|$|Lafayette, when captured, {{had tried}} to use the <b>American</b> <b>citizenship</b> he had been granted to secure his release, and {{contacted}} William Short, United States minister in The Hague. Although Short and other U.S. envoys very much wanted to succor Lafayette for his services to their country, they knew that {{his status as a}} French officer took precedence over any claim to <b>American</b> <b>citizenship.</b> Washington, who was by then president, had instructed the envoys to avoid actions that entangled the country in European affairs, and the U.S. did not have diplomatic relations with either Prussia or Austria. They did send money for the use of Lafayette, and for his wife, whom the French had imprisoned. Secretary of State Jefferson found a loophole allowing Lafayette to be paid, with interest, for his services as a major general from 1777 to 1783. An act was rushed through Congress and signed by President Washington. These funds allowed both Lafayettes privileges in their captivity.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, and while living in northern France, Wodehouse was captured by the Germans and was interned for over a year. After his release he was tricked into making five comic and apolitical broadcasts on German radio to the still neutral US. After vehement protests in Britain, Wodehouse never returned to his home country again, despite being cleared by an MI5 investigation. He moved to the US permanently in 1947 and took <b>American</b> <b>citizenship</b> in 1955. He continued writing until his death in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Edward Wadie Said {{was born}} on 1 November 1935, to Hilda Said and Wadie Said, a {{businessman}} in Jerusalem, then part of British-governed Mandatory Palestine (1920–48). Wadie Said was a Palestinian man who soldiered in the U.S. Army component of the American Expeditionary Forces (1917–19), commanded by General John J. Pershing, in the First World War (1914–18). Afterwards, that war-time military service earned <b>American</b> <b>citizenship</b> to Said père and his family. Edward’s mother, Hilda Said was born Lebanese and raised in Nazareth, Palestine.|$|E

Petrosino traced him to New Orleans, where Cascioferro had gone to escape detection, but he had already slipped away.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the experiences of}} 1. 5 and 2 nd generation Korean American immigrant college students and the ways that their hybridized Korean <b>American</b> cultural <b>citizenship</b> place them into processes of self-making within the contexts of social networks, their changing legal citizenship, and experiences of racialization as Asians in America. This thesis specifically focuses on the consumption of Korean popular media, including Korean popular music, TV shows, news, and movies, {{as a manifestation of}} hybridized Korean <b>American</b> cultural <b>citizenship.</b> Using Korean popular media as a lens through which to consider hybridized Korean <b>American</b> cultural <b>citizenship,</b> this thesis ultimately aims to consider the ways that young diasporic Korean Americans continually navigate the constructions and contestations of their hybridized cultural identities as they negotiate belonging within both Korean and American national imaginaries...|$|R

5|$|Bowie renounced his <b>American</b> <b>citizenship</b> {{and became}} a Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after {{promising}} to establish textile mills {{in the state of}} Coahuila y Tejas. To fulfill his promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton and wool mills in Saltillo. With his citizenship assured, Bowie now had the right to buy up to 11leagues of public land. He convinced 14 or 15 other citizens to apply for land in order to turn it over to him, giving him 700,000acres (280,000ha) for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants, which could then be sold in bulk to speculators as Bowie had. The Mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation.|$|E
5|$|Monteux {{was well}} known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a {{conducting}} class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux {{in the south of}} France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking <b>American</b> <b>citizenship,</b> he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, André Previn, Lorin Maazel, Seiji Ozawa and David Zinman. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Grainger {{moved to}} the United States, where he lived {{for the rest of}} his life, though he {{travelled}} widely in Europe and in Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the United States Army during 1917–18, and took <b>American</b> <b>citizenship</b> in 1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922 he became increasingly involved in educational work. He also experimented with music machines that he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works and as a future research archive. As he grew older he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the Second World War, ill health reduced his levels of activity, and he considered his career a failure. He gave his last concert in 1960, less than a year before his death.|$|E

5|$|Puerto Rico {{is a large}} island on the {{northern}} rim of the Caribbean Sea {{that is home to}} approximately 4 million people.

Puerto Rico was first colonized by the Spanish, but was ceded to the United States in the wake of the Spanish–American War in 1898. Puerto Ricans were granted <b>American</b> <b>citizenship</b> in 1917, although it remained apart from the United States and has a constitution that provides for self-government. 41 years after Puerto Ricans became American citizens, Puerto Rico sent its first delegation to the Olympics at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, England. The American commonwealth has sent a delegation to all sixteen Summer Olympics between then and the 2008 Beijing Olympics in addition to six Winter Olympic games.|$|E
