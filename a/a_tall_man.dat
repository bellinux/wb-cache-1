5|$|In 1865–1867 Captain Thomas Chaloner and William Downing Bruce {{carried out}} the first major {{excavation}} by cutting a trench across the site. A number of features were discovered, including a stone coffin containing the skeleton of <b>a</b> <b>tall</b> <b>man</b> thought to be Robert de Brus, {{the remnants of a}} monumental shrine and painted roof bosses. Evidence of the 1289 fire was discovered in the form of pieces of fused metal – an amalgam of lead, silver and iron that had melted and penetrated the floor {{in the heat of the}} fire. The Office of Works carried out excavations in 1932 in conjunction with work to consolidate the walls and grounds so they could be opened to the public. Further work was carried out by Roy Gilyard Beer between 1947–54 for the Ministry of Works, which exposed more of the site and cleared material from the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>tall</b> <b>man,</b> {{he might}} have {{achieved}} even {{more than he did}} but for back trouble. Even so, he was an essential member of the Surrey side for many years. As a batsman, he preferred to attack, and was an especially fine driver of the ball. He was often at his best in a crisis. He reached a thousand runs in a season nine times in succession (1938–1939 and 1946–1952 – this excludes 1945, in which season he played in only one match). His medium-paced bowling was generally steady rather than particularly penetrative. He took 50 or more wickets in a season 5 times, but never managed more than 67.|$|E

500|$|O'Reilly {{was one of}} {{the best}} spin bowlers ever to play cricket. He {{delivered}} the ball from a two-fingered grip at close to medium pace with great accuracy, and could produce leg breaks, googlies, and top spinners, with no discernible change in his action. <b>A</b> <b>tall</b> <b>man</b> for a spinner (around 188cm, 6ft 2in), he whirled his arms to an unusual extent and had a low point of delivery that meant it was very difficult for the batsman to read the flight of the ball out of his hand. When O'Reilly died, Sir Donald Bradman said that he was the greatest bowler he had ever faced or watched. In 1935, Wisden wrote of him: [...] "O'Reilly {{was one of the}} best examples in modern cricket of what could be described as a 'hostile' bowler." [...] In 1939, Wisden reflected on Bill O'Reilly's successful 1938 Ashes tour of England: [...] "He is emphatically one of the greatest bowlers of all time." ...|$|E
