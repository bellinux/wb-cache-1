Mergesort is a stable sort, unlike {{standard}} in-place quicksort and heapsort, {{and can be}} easily adapted to operate on linked lists and very large lists stored on slow-to-access media such as disk storage or network <b>attached</b> <b>storage.</b> Although quicksort can be implemented as a stable sort using linked lists, it will often suffer from poor pivot choices without random access. The main disadvantage of mergesort is that, when operating on arrays, efficient implementations require O(n) auxiliary space, whereas the variant of quicksort with in-place partitioning and tail recursion uses only [...] space. (Note that when operating on linked lists, mergesort only requires a small, constant amount of auxiliary storage.) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{trend in}} the design of computer systems is the expectation of much greater computational power in future generations of microprocessors. This trend applies to embedded systems as well as host processors. As a result, devices such as storage controllers have excess capacity and growing computational capabilities. Storage system designers are exploiting this trend with higher-level interfaces to storage and increased intelligence inside storage devices. One development in this direction is Network-Attached Secure Disks (NASD) which <b>attaches</b> <b>storage</b> devices directly to the network and raises the storage interface above the simple (fixed-size block) memory abstraction of SCSI. This allows devices more freedom to provide efficient operations; promises more scalable subsystems by offloading file system and storage management functionality from dedicated servers; and reduces latency by executing common case requests directly at storage devices.

40|$|AbstractProteomics methods, {{especially}} high-throughput {{mass spectrometry}} analysis have been continually developed and improved over the years. The analysis of complex biological samples produces {{large volumes of}} raw data. Data storage and recovery management pose substantial challenges to biomedical or proteomic facilities regarding backup and archiving concepts as well as hardware requirements. In this article we describe differences between the terms backup and archive with regard to manual and automatic approaches. We also introduce different storage concepts and technologies from transportable media to professional solutions such as redundant array of independent disks (RAID) systems, network <b>attached</b> <b>storages</b> (NAS) and storage area network (SAN). Moreover, we present a software solution, which we developed {{for the purpose of}} long-term preservation of large mass spectrometry raw data files on an object storage device (OSD) archiving system.

40|$|Abstract â€” Data {{sharing and}} file {{distributions}} {{are the two}} primary functions of network <b>attached</b> <b>storages.</b> Fibre Channel based Storage Area Networks (FC-SAN) has become a more popular solution for the enterprise storage requirements and provides high speed data transfer with high availability, scalability and reliable storage solutions. As SAN keeps and shares entire organizations critical information, it {{is considered to be}} more vulnerable to the attackers who gain a single point of access. In most of the data sharing operations among network users, uses encrypted data transfer with proper key management. Securing the SAN data with public key algorithm like RSA is the least less discussed topic and generating keys is a difficult task in distributed environment like Storage Area networks. SAN, considered to be a heterogeneous network, needs distributed key management for the scalability {{which is one of the}} important advantages of using SAN. This research paper explores the deployment of RSA algorithm with component based key generation without a key server. This paper also uses compression algorithm ALDC to compress the data during transmission for faster data transfer. The SAN performance was analyzed after the implementation RSA and ALDC algorithm in a customized testing SAN scenario and throughput analysis done for the effectiveness of cryptographic key management...|$|R
