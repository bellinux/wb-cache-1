25|$|The {{hunger for}} more Doctor Who on television, {{especially}} between the show's cancellation in 1989 and its return in 2005, was partly answered by direct-to-video productions by various companies. The BBC has never authorised <b>any</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who video productions but production {{companies have been}} able to license individual characters and alien races from the show directly from the writers who created them, and feature them in adventures of their own.|$|E
25|$|In most countries, {{isotretinoin}} {{can only}} be prescribed by dermatologists or specialist physicians; some countries also allow limited prescription by general practitioners and family doctors. In the United Kingdom and Australia, isotretinoin may be prescribed only by or {{under the supervision of}} a consultant dermatologist. Because severe cystic acne has the potential to cause permanent scarring over a short period, restrictions on its more immediate availability have proved contentious. In New Zealand, isotretinoin can be prescribed by <b>any</b> <b>doctor</b> but subsidised only when prescribed by a vocationally-registered general practitioner, dermatologist or nurse practitioner.|$|E

30|$|Any health problem, {{present or}} historic, that may {{interfere}} with the individual’s ability to undergo military service {{is supposed to be}} reflected in our measure of overall health status. The individual had to bring <b>any</b> <b>doctor’s</b> certificate, health record, drug prescription, or similar to the NSA proving that he actually suffered from the conditions he reported in his health declaration.|$|R
50|$|His {{increased}} isolation bred rumours, {{including one}} {{that he was a}} cannibal or ate only raw meat - when he ate mainly beef tea and nibbled at venison. He also refused to see <b>any</b> <b>doctors.</b> As for church service, he claimed that God was best worshipped at natural altars of the earth, the sea and the sky - not to mention that the sermons were boring.|$|R
500|$|In the courtroom, Peter exaggerates the story. The {{judge is}} not convinced, and even recalls his own {{prostate}} exam being uneventful. However, after further prompting from Peter, the judge [...] "remembers" [...] being abused and declares Hartman guilty, revoking his license. As Peter celebrates his victory at The Drunken Clam, his frequent need to urinate causes great concern among his friends, where Seamus informs {{him that his}} prostate may be infected. However, his lawsuit makes it unlikely that <b>any</b> <b>doctor</b> would treat him, and indeed, not one does. Peter visits Dr. Hartman in disguise and unsuccessfully tries to trick him into giving the exam, but the doctor decides that his Hippocratic Oath requires him {{to go ahead with}} the examination anyway. Peter's constant urinating turns out to be due to a minor infection and blockage caused by Mr. Sulu somehow being up Peter's rectum. In the epilogue, Dr. Hartman's license is reinstated and he and Peter reconcile.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Mulkern, {{writing for}} the Radio Times, {{described}} the episode as [...] "simply superb television" [...] and claimed that [...] "Matt Smith really is {{shaping up to be}} the best Doctor since Tom Baker", praising him for being [...] "simultaneously intense and subtle". He thought it started out with [...] "arguably the most impressive opener to <b>any</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who yet" [...] and also praised Amy for being [...] "cheerfully free of the emotional baggage that mired her predecessors" [...] so far. Matt Wales of IGN gave the episode a 10 out of 10 rating, calling it [...] "huge, silly, scary, gorgeous, gripping and– most importantly– fun". Although he wrote it [...] "never quite matched the relentless tension of 'Blink'", he commented that it was [...] "flawlessly paced and, when it mattered, genuinely scary". Unlike Fuller, he praised the TARDIS [...] "vworp vworp" [...] joke, asking [...] "Who could possibly not love the sheer audacity in suggesting the TARDIS's iconic whirring noise {{was the result of the}} Doctor leaving the brakes on for the last 45 years?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{the role}} of a GP was once {{performed}} by <b>any</b> <b>doctor</b> qualified in a medical school working in the community. However, since the 1950s general practice has become a specialty in its own right, with specific training requirements tailored to each country. The Alma Ata Declaration in 1978 set the intellectual foundation of what primary care and general practice is nowadays.|$|E
5000|$|Beema Umma {{actually}} {{arrived from}} Arabia {{and settled in}} Kannur first time. Then she travelled to Southern kerala and settled in Thiruvalla. It was said that Nagamani Nadar in court of Mathanda varama had affected a severe secret disease below his abdomen {{and he knew that}} if the Royal members knew it he would remove from his office. But he didn't find <b>any</b> <b>doctors</b> to cure it.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 35 claims {{per year}} {{are brought to}} the {{attention}} of the Lourdes Medical Bureau. Most of these are dismissed quickly. Three to five each year are investigated more thoroughly, by drawing up a Medical Bureau, comprising <b>any</b> <b>doctors</b> who were present in Lourdes at the time the apparent cure took place (this is the rationale for all members to notify the bureau of their visits to Lourdes).|$|R
50|$|<b>Any</b> <b>doctors</b> {{practicing}} in or visiting Lourdes may apply to become {{members of the}} Lourdes Medical Bureau. Additionally, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists and members of other allied health professions may apply to become members. Members are given (and invited to wear) a small but distinctive badge displaying a red cross on a white background surmounted by the word Credo ("I believe"). However, members of any religious affiliation or none are welcomed.|$|R
2500|$|His only popular {{work after}} Fanny Hill was an {{adaptation}} of a French original for Dictionary of Love in 1753. However, he wrote a verse satire entitled [...] "The Times!" [...] (1760 and 1761), a burlesque of Robert Dodsley's The Oeconomy of Human Life {{in the form of}} The Oeconomy of a Winter's Day (1750), a biography of Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV of France in 1760, {{and a great deal of}} translation and review work. He contributed thirty reviews for the Monthly Review and over two hundred letters for the Public Advertiser between 1749 and 1787. In his later years, he also wrote two highly idiosyncratic and overly positive medical works and told Boswell that he knew more about nerves than <b>any</b> <b>doctor</b> in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Only {{first aid}} {{provided}} without intention of reward or financial compensation is covered. Medical professionals are typically not protected by good Samaritan laws when performing first aid {{in connection with}} their employment. Some states make specific provisions for trained medical professionals acting as volunteers and for members of volunteer rescue squads acting without expectation of remuneration. In Texas, a physician who voluntarily assisted {{in the delivery of}} an infant, and who proved that he had [...] "no expectation of remuneration", had no liability for the infant's injuries due to allegedly ordinary negligence; there was [...] "uncontroverted testimony that neither he nor <b>any</b> <b>doctor</b> in Travis County would have charged a fee to [...] or any other person under the circumstances of this case." [...] It was significant that the doctor was not an employee of the attending physician, but was only visiting the hospital and had responded to a [...] "Dr. Stork" [...] page, and had not asked or expected to be paid.|$|E

60|$|We bound this beast {{with leather}} thongs of the punkah-rope, and tied its thumbs and big toes together, and gagged {{it with a}} shoe-horn, which makes a very {{efficient}} gag {{if you know how}} to arrange it. Then we carried it into the dining-room, and sent a man to Dumoise, the doctor, telling him to come over at once. After we had despatched the messenger and were drawing breath, Strickland said, 'It's no good. This isn't <b>any</b> <b>doctor's</b> work.' I, also, knew that he spoke the truth.|$|R
5000|$|The {{industrialist}} Alberti is an {{very wealthy}} man, but {{is concerned about}} Angelika, his fragile, anemic daughter. She is terminally ill and frequently bedridden. Alberti would give all his wealth if he could do anything for Angelika. Alberti had consulted <b>any</b> <b>doctors</b> about his daughter's case, but every effort was in vain. The doctors have long given up. But to [...] "give up" [...] {{does not appear in}} the vocabulary of Angelika's father. Only in the medical student Helga, who earns her living as a nurse, does he find an ally.|$|R

5|$|Soon afterward, Alan Ray {{came back}} into the picture, {{claiming}} that he had proof the card had been doctored by Mastro at one point after the initial $25,000 trade in 1985. He had a photograph of the card taken before the transaction with Mastro and claimed that the card in the photo looked significantly different from the photo of Gretzky's card. He sent the comparison of the two photos to both McNall and Sotheby's, but never received a response back. Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray's claims, saying that the photo hardly proves <b>any</b> <b>doctoring</b> was ever done on the card.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry if}} he was troublesome," [...] said the woman, [...] "but {{he must have been}} shamefully beaten. I could show the marks to <b>any</b> <b>doctor.</b> I'm sure it isn't allowed, if it was known." ...|$|E

50|$|Thousands of labours died {{annually}} due to non-availability of Medical care as {{the medical}} system was very poor in the tea gardens of Assam. The gardens did not appoint <b>any</b> <b>doctors.</b> Though Colonial Government tried to bound the tea gardens to appoint, European Medical officers and send Health report to the Government regularly but tea gardens refused to accept it. Most of the gardens didn't have hospitals to treat the ill health labourers. Most of the gardens appointed some trained physicians called LMP (Learned Medical Practitioner) doctor only after 1889, when Berry White Medical School was set up at Barbari, Dibrugarh.|$|R

The doctor had administered composing medicine. [...] "My patient is asleep now," [...] he told me; [...] "but remember what I said to you the last time we met; a longer rest than <b>any</b> <b>doctor's</b> prescription can give him is what he wants.

40|$|In the {{matching}} with contracts setting, we provide two new axiomatic characterizations of the "cumulative offer process" (COP) {{in the domain}} of hospital choices satisfying "unilateral substitutes" and "irrelevance of rejected contracts. " We say that a mechanism is truncation-proof if no doctor can ever benefit from truncating his preferences. Our first result shows that the COP is the unique stable and truncation-proof mechanism. Next, we say that a mechanism is invariant to lower tail preferences change if <b>any</b> <b>doctor's</b> assignment does not depend on his preferences over worse contracts. Our second characterization shows that a mechanism is stable and invariant to lower tail preferences change if and only if it is the COP...|$|R
