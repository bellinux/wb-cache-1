5|$|In {{the battle}} and the {{following}} siege, French-speaking Canadians were active {{on both sides of}} the conflict. The American forces received supplies <b>and</b> <b>logistical</b> support from local residents, and the city's defenders included locally raised militia. When the Americans retreated, they were accompanied by a number of their supporters; those who remained behind were subjected to a variety of punishments after the British re-established control over the province.|$|E
5|$|On the 1895 Mazamas expedition, {{the first}} {{heliography}} between {{several of the}} peaks of the Cascades was attempted with some success.

5|$|Once Soviet {{resistance}} {{along the}} Vyazma-Bryansk front was eliminated, German forces were to press east, encircling Moscow by outflanking {{it from the}} north and south. Continuous fighting had reduced their effectiveness, <b>and</b> <b>logistical</b> difficulties became more acute. Guderian wrote that some of his destroyed tanks had not been replaced, and there were fuel shortages {{at the start of the}} operation.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese force lacked for transport, {{engineer}} <b>and</b> <b>logistical</b> {{support and}} was hampered {{by a lack}} of cohesion due to its disparate command structure and poor infrastructure. In contrast, the Australian force had fought together in previous campaigns and was backed up by a formidable logistical support base that could deliver them a technological and industrial superiority that the Japanese were unable to match.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice between}} scuba and surface {{supplied}} diving equipment {{is based on}} both legal <b>and</b> <b>logistical</b> constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly commercial diving, may be restricted to surface supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.|$|E

5|$|After {{the scale}} of the damage became clear, the {{government}} of Yemen requested for assistance from the international community. The hardest hit areas had poor infrastructure, which caused difficulties in communications as relief goods were distributed. Nations in the region, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, sent money and supplies to help rebuild the damaged infrastructure and houses. Agencies under the United Nations provided food <b>and</b> <b>logistical</b> support. Relief efforts continued to make progress until 2011 due to a political uprising in Yemen.|$|E
5|$|As {{nuclear weapons}} {{development}} proceeded, the weapons became mass-produced, smaller, lighter, {{and easier to}} store, handle and maintain. They also required less effort to assemble. The AFSWP gradually shifted its emphasis away from training assembly teams, and became more involved in stockpile management and providing administrative, technical <b>and</b> <b>logistical</b> support. It supported nuclear weapons testing, although after Operation Sandstone in 1948, this was increasingly in a planning and training capacity rather than a field role. In 1958, the AFSWP became the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA), a field agency of the Department of Defense.|$|E
5|$|By 1914 the Territorial Force {{had some}} 30,000 men {{involved}} in divisional level training camps; two years previously, the manpower <b>and</b> <b>logistical</b> {{constraints of the}} force was such that only battalion level camps could be achieved. When General Ian Hamilton, the Inspector General of Overseas Forces, visited New Zealand in 1914, he {{was impressed with the}} level of preparedness of the country's military. This reflected positively on Godley's work, and he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George the same year.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Sihanouk's {{delicate}} {{domestic and foreign}} policy balancing act was beginning to go awry. In 1966, an agreement was struck between the prince and the Chinese, allowing the presence of large-scale PAVN and Viet Cong troop deployments <b>and</b> <b>logistical</b> bases in the eastern border regions. He had also agreed to allow the use of the port of Sihanoukville by communist-flagged vessels delivering supplies and material to support the PAVN/Viet Cong military effort in South Vietnam. These concessions made questionable Cambodia's neutrality, which had been guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954.|$|E

On 22 July 2008, the brigade's soldiers underwent final preparations before departing Rammstein Air Base for northern Iraq.

5|$|The geographical, {{engineering}} <b>and</b> <b>logistical</b> {{difficulties of}} conducting operations in SWPA were driven home by Alamo Force's first operation, Operation Chronicle, {{the occupation of}} Woodlark and Kiriwina Islands in June 1943. Despite {{the fact that the}} operation was unopposed by the Japanese, it was subject to delays. Krueger visited Kiriwina, where road work and airbase development were held up by heavy rains, on 11 July. He was dissatisfied with the rate of progress and relieved the task force commander. The arrival of additional engineers sped up the base development effort, and No. 79 Squadron RAAF commenced operations from Kiriwina on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the closure has been questioned, as the United States still {{has the ability to}} conduct drone attacks from nearby bases in Afghanistan, and {{according}} to the Pakistani military, the base was used mainly for refuelling and maintenance of drones, as well as for emergency landings <b>and</b> <b>logistical</b> support, and not for conducting actual drone operations which had in fact ceased in April 2011. Following the incident, Pakistan stated its intention to shoot down any future US drones intruding on its airspace, and the US suspended drone operations to avoid antagonising Pakistan. One report said that American drone attacks in Pakistan dropped by as much as 50% due to the Salala attack, as well as legal cases.|$|E
5|$|The wing began re-equipping with P-51D Mustangs at Labuan in September 1945. No.481 (Maintenance) Squadron {{was formed}} in December from {{elements}} of No.22 Repair and Servicing Unit, No.25 Air Stores Park, and other units based on Labuan. No.381 (Base) Squadron, established in January 1946, also utilised personnel and equipment from No.81 Wing's specialist units at Labuan, including No.47 Operational Base Unit, No.24 Medical Clearing Station, No.25 Air Stores Park and No.2 Airfield Defence Squadron. RAAF base squadrons were administrative <b>and</b> <b>logistical</b> units, intended to make their wings self-supporting and mobile for potential deployment.|$|E

5|$|Washington gained {{valuable}} military skills {{during the}} war, acquiring tactical, strategic, <b>and</b> <b>logistical</b> military experience. He also acquired important political skills in {{his dealings with}} the British military establishment and the provincial government. His military exploits, although they included some notable failures, made his military reputation in the colonies such that he became a natural selection as {{the commander in chief}} of the Continental Army following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775. His successes in military and political spheres during that conflict led to his election as the first President of the United States of America.|$|E
5|$|When the {{division}} was {{not engaged in}} coastal-defence duties or unit training, formation-level training {{took the form of}} increasingly larger exercises. Exercise Waterloo, conducted from 14‚Äì16June 1941, was the largest in the United Kingdom to date, with ICanadian Corps counter-attacking an imagined German sea and air landing. Exercise Bumper, held from 29September to 3October, was larger still, involving 250,000 men. These exercises tended to concentrate on traffic control, communications, <b>and</b> <b>logistical</b> concerns, and were of little practical value to the infantry.|$|E
5|$|After several false {{starts in}} early September, the Continental Army {{established}} a siege around Fort St. Jean. Beset by illness, bad weather, <b>and</b> <b>logistical</b> problems, they established mortar batteries that {{were able to}} penetrate into the interior the fort, but the defenders, who were well-supplied with munitions, but not food and other supplies, persisted in their defence, believing the siege would be broken by forces from Montreal under General Guy Carleton. On October 18, the nearby Fort Chambly fell, and on October 30, an attempt at relief by Carleton was thwarted. When word of this {{made its way to}} St. Jean's defenders, combined with a new battery opening fire on the fort, the fort's defenders capitulated, surrendering on November 3.|$|E
