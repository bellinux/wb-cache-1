5000|$|Kilbourne's {{work has}} been cited and heavily {{discussed}} in academics, in both research journals and the classroom. In Tyson Smith's Pumping Irony: The Construction of Masculinity in a Post-feminist Advertising Campaign Kilbourne is cited for her statements on advertising alcohol in the article's section focusing on a campaign for Jim Beam bourbon, which sought to bring the young, white, middle-class heterosexual male. Though paraphrased, Smith references Kilbourne when critiquing the ad campaign, that alcohol consumption typically leads to addiction, and that alcohol brands aim to create a bond between the potential addict and the brand itself. The reasoning being that [...] "the addict is the ideal customer" [...] because [...] "ten percent of drinkers consume over 60% of all alcohol sold." [...] Kilbourne is further reference in Smith's article, particularly about the link between drinking alcohol {{and the image of}} masculinity. The very concept of alcohol consumption is [...] "seen as both rebellious and dangerous" [...] and a rite of passage to become 'a real man.' Alcohol advertisements [...] "walk a fine line between wildness and anti-social behavior" [...] as Kilbourne said because ads typically depict personality changes in people after consumption, [...] "normalizing" [...] the change, and often associate the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>product</b> and defiance. The ad campaign itself, titled Real Friends, featured the 'everyday guy' such as the bar frequenter with text such as [...] "If the chicks ask, we're watching the footy" [...] rather than using the hyper-masculine image of men, yet reinforces the hyper-masculine stereotype since the men in the campaign are [...] "assertive and defiant in the form of rejecting women's demands." ...|$|E
