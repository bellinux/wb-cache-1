In this study a newly prepared <b>aliphatic</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> namely cyclohexanone glyoxylate condensate (CG) was synthesized. The prepared compound (CG) was characterized using Fourier Transition Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and microanalysis of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and sulfur elemental analysis techniques. The effect of additions of 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75 and 1 (mass%) of this admixture on the mechanical and early hydration characteristics of OWC pastes was studied. The phase composition for some selected hardened specimens was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravemtic analysis (DTGA) techniques. The results indicated that, addition of cyclohexanone glyoxylate condensate (CG) admixture to OWC pastes causes a slight retardation for the early rate of hydration of OWC. Addition of 0. 25 % of CG to OWC causes a slight improvement in the compressive strength values during nearly all ages of hydrations. XRD and DTGA results for the neat and CG admixed OWC pastes, indicate that the main hydration products are nearly amorphous calcium silicate hydrates (mainly as CSH-I and CSH-II), calcium sulfoaluminate hydrates (ettringite and monosulfate hydrate) as well as portlandite (CH) ...|$|E

In particular, we investigated a sealed bioreactor where the growth medium was contaminated with an increasing amount of TCE, in the range 55 – 280 mg/L; the removal capability of the maize plants was assessed by means of GC-MS and LC-MS analyses. An accurate mass balance of the system revealed that the plants were able to remove and metabolise TCE with an efficiency up to 20 %, depending on the total amount of TCE delivered in the bioreactor. Morphometric data showed that the growth of Z. mays is not significantly affected by the presence of the pollutant up to a concentration of 280 mg/L, while plants show significant alterations at higher TCE concentrations until the growth is completely inhibited for [TCE] ≃ 2000 mg/L. Finally, the presence of several TCE metabolites, including dichloroacetic and trichloroacetic acids, was detected in the roots and in the aerial part of the plants, revealing that Z. mays follows the green liver metabolic model.

This study evaluated the distribution of carbon (C) in the chemical fractions {{as well as the}} chemical characteristics and humification degree of OM in a soil constructed after coal mining under cultivation of perennial grasses. The experiment was established in 2003 with the following treatments: Hemarthria altissima (T 1), Paspalum notatum (T 2), Cynodon dactilon (T 3), Urochloa brizantha (T 4), bare constructed soil (T 5), and natural soil (T 6). In 2009, soil samples were collected from the 0. 00 - 0. 03 m layer and the total organic carbon stock (TOC) and C stock in the chemical fractions: acid extract (CHCl), fulvic acid (CFA), humic acid (CHA), and humin (CHU) were determined. The humic acid (HA) fraction was characterized by infrared spectroscopy and the laser-induced fluorescence index (ILIF) of OM was also calculated.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the Estate of Dr. Andrew David Gallacher. Previous studies on Australian opal were geologically uncontrolled and analysed specimens were commonly from an unknown source. This research is the first integrated geologically-controlled study of sedimentary opal in Australia {{with the aim of}} refining models for opal genesis. The work was undertaken in the recently-discovered Hebel field of southern Queensland. Mapping, underground sampling and RAB drilling specifically for this project were undertaken. After petrography, weathered host rocks and opal were analysed by XRF, XRD, INAA, LA-ICP-MS mass spectrometry. Geologically-constrained precious and non-precious opal samples were analysed by using mass spectrometry, EMPA, IR, NMR, SEM and bioluminescence. Opal is hosted by porous, low density kaolinite-bearing Early Cretaceous argillaceous sediments overlain by Tertiary rudites and arenites. The sequence is highly weathered and mapping, mineralogical, geochemical and isotope studies show that weathering becomes less intense with depth. Deep weathering took place in the Late Cretaceous and silicification associated with tropical weathering took place in the Early Tertiary. Later Tertiary cooler more arid weathering features overprint the earlier weathering. Geochemical and isotopic studies show that during the long period of weathering, there was constant re-equilibration in an open dynamic evolving system as it still is today. Opal occurrences are stratigraphically controlled by smectitic-bearing clay horizons. There are possible local structures such as faults, joints and bedding planes which allowed the plastic deformation of opaline gel by dehydration into the enveloping smectitic sediments. Opal underwent post-consolidation brittle deformation. Continued long term weathering produced bleaching of and trace element stripping from of the outer rims of opal. This study confirmed structural differences between nonprecious and precious opal and showed that opal operates as a molecular sponge. Hence {{it was not possible to}} obtain a RblSr age of formation of opal but it was possible to show, on the basis of 0 and H isotopes, that there were several periods of isotopic overprinting, probably related to different episodes of weathering. NMR, IR and EMP A studies showed that the molecular structure of opal is governed by impurities, water occurs as OH- and possible short chain <b>aliphatic</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> occur in the structure. Short chain aliphatic compounds are of biological origin. SEM studies show bacterial microfossil silica pseudomorphs. No DNA was detected in opal. Opal formed from long-term intense tropical weathering of porous permeable clastic sediments. Descending silica-laden fluids were dehydrated by expanding-lattice clays and formed as gel in structural sites in favourable stratigraphic horizons. Ubiquitous microorganisms probably played a role in opal deposition, possibly providing the locus for structural distortion during colloidal precipitation thereby promoting the formation of nonprecious opal. It is suggested that precious opal has formed from colloidal silica precipitation in the absence of bacteria thereby explaining the rarity of precious opal. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|Doctoral thesis, Tampere University of Technology, Publication 540 The {{importance}} of developing methods {{for the hazard}} assessment of solid wastes is steadily increasing worldwide. The main objective of this thesis {{was to develop a}} new approach to waste hazard classification that combines leaching and ecotoxicity tests, since the determination of total concentrations of substances in complex mixtures of unknown composition, which is a characteristic of many wastes, does not provide an accurate estimation of the overall environmental impact of solid wastes. Chemical classification was carried out by comparing total concentrations of key hazardous substances in the wastes studied with the limit values set for hazardous wastes, and comparing the leached amounts of the substances with the limit values proposed by the EU. Four wastes studied from the metal and forest industries contained predominantly inorganic compounds and ten from the furniture and resin industries mainly aromatic or <b>aliphatic</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Six soil samples contaminated by petroleum products were studied in order to evaluate their environmental hazard after remediation. Various types of leaching tests were used to study the leaching profiles of key hazardous substances in four predominantly inorganic wastes. Onestage or multistage batch leaching tests were also used to study the leaching of volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> from the <b>organic</b> wastes and that of petroleum products from the soil samples. The ecotoxicity of substances leached out from the wastes was studied from the eluates of batch leaching tests with different combinations of aquatic ecotoxicity tests: microbial tests, water flea and algal tests, electron transport assay (RET) and plant tests. In addition, the ecotoxicity of oilcontaminated soils was studied directly from solid materials with plant seed germination tests and enchytraeid worm survival and reproduction tests and the ecotoxicity of the organic wastes was investigated with a lettuce seed germination test before and after the leaching experiments. The {{results of the present study}} proved that the environmental hazard of solid wastes and soil samples was underestimated when only the total concentrations of known key hazardous substances were analyzed. It was also found that the release of these substances should be determined in order to predict the longterm environmental impacts of solid wastes. It was also important to perform an availability test on the inorganic wastes in order to ascertain their resistance to acid attack. The batch leaching tests performed on the organic wastes and contaminated soil samples studied showed that these methods should be used to screen the waterleachable fraction of the key <b>organic</b> <b>compounds.</b> The differences between the chemical and ecotoxicological classification emphasized the need for ecotoxicity tests to complement chemical analyses in the hazard classification of wastes. For example, fly ash was classified as nonhazardous by chemical analyses but ecotoxicity assays proved that the batch leaching test eluates of this waste had high or very high aquatic toxicity (10 100). The organic wastes contained large amounts of compounds not identifiable with available chemical analyses. A more costeffective and relevant estimation of the overall environmental hazard of complex mixtures of unknown substances in solid wastes and their eluates could be made with a combined solidphase and liquidphase approach using ecotoxicity assays and TOC analyses. Based on the present study, the European batch leaching test method (EN 124572) was proposed for the combined chemical and ecotoxicological classification of substances leached out from inorganic and organic wastes and soils. Only then can ecotoxicity test results be compared with chemical analyses to improve hazard classification when selecting the best waste management alternative. The battery of toxicity tests should consist of costeffective methods that are simple to perform, in which the volume required for analyses is minimized. According to this study, the luminescent bacteria test, MetPLATE and ToxiChromo tests, RET assay and onion root elongation test were the best choice. Wheat or lettuce seed germination tests are proposed for the determination of the ecotoxicity of solid wastes. The proposed terrestrial toxicity method for oilcontaminated soils was the Enchytraeid worm (E. albidus) survival test. This study demonstrated that environmental hazard assessment of solid wastes based only on the chemical analyses of known key hazardous substances and available regulatory values was inadequate. The results showed that the criteria for both waste classification and management could be improved by setting criteria and limit values for ecotoxicity test results. A new screening approach and criteria for the evaluation of the environmental toxicity of wastes are presented. This approach would aid environmental authorities in making decisions on waste hazard classification and help waste producers to improve their processes and minimize the environmental impacts of wastes...|$|R
