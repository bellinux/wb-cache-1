25|$|The velocipede's renaissance {{began in}} Paris {{during the late}} 1860s. Its early history is complex and has been {{shrouded}} in some mystery, not least because of conflicting patent claims: all that has been stated for sure is that a French metalworker attached pedals to the front wheel; at present, the earliest year bicycle historians <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>is</b> 1864. The identity {{of the person who}} attached cranks is still an open question at International Cycling History Conferences (ICHC). The claims of Ernest Michaux and of Pierre Lallement, and the lesser claims of rear-pedaling Alexandre Lefebvre, have their supporters within the ICHC community.|$|E
25|$|Lebanon has by far {{the largest}} {{proportion}} of Christians of any Middle Eastern country, but both Christians and Muslims are sub-divided into many splinter sects and denominations. Population statistics are highly controversial. The various denominations and sects each have vested interests in inflating their own numbers. Shias, Sunnis, Maronites and Greek Orthodox (the four largest denominations) all often claim that their particular religious affiliation holds a majority in the country, adding up to over 150% of the total population, even before counting the other denominations. One of the rare things that most Lebanese religious leaders will <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>is</b> to avoid a new general census, for fear that it could trigger a new round of denominational conflict. The last official census was performed in 1932.|$|E

2500|$|Something {{that most}} critics <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>is</b> this major theme. Magic realist {{literature}} tends {{to read at}} an intensified level. Taking One Hundred Years of Solitude, the reader must let go of preexisting ties to conventional exposition, plot advancement, linear time structure, scientific reason, etc., to strive for a state of heightened awareness of life's connectedness or hidden meanings. Luis Leal articulates this feeling as [...] "to seize the mystery that breathes behind things", and supports the claim by saying a writer must heighten his senses {{to the point of}} [...] "estado limite" [...] (translated as [...] "limit state" [...] or [...] "extreme") in order to realize all levels of reality, most importantly that of mystery.|$|E

They also tend to question some of the denomination's 28 fundamental beliefs: with debate arising on the nature of the Trinity, perpetuity of the Law of God, the Nature of Christ, the Gift of Prophecy, Creation or observance of the seventh-day Sabbath." [...] It also has many similarities with the ecumenical emerging church movement which those involved in, mostly <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>is</b> their disillusionment with the organized and institutional church. Perceptions and definitions of it may differ somewhat depending on the author, although much in common is also clearly discernible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{causes of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{have been the}} subject of much debate, with various factors proposed and discounted or modified. The language of schizophrenia research under the medical model is scientific. [...] Such studies suggest that genetics, prenatal development, early environment, neurobiology and psychological and social processes are important contributory factors. Current psychiatric research into the development of the disorder is often based on a neurodevelopmental model [...] (proponents of which see schizophrenia as a syndrome.) However, schizophrenia is diagnosed on the basis of symptom profiles. Neural correlates do not provide sufficiently useful criteria. [...] "Current research into schizophrenia has remained highly fragmented, much like the clinical presentation of the disease itself". The one thing that researchers can <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>is</b> that schizophrenia is a complicated and variable condition. It is best thought of as a syndrome, a cluster of symptoms that may or may not have related causes, rather than a single disease.|$|E

5000|$|One matter they <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> <b>was</b> the undesirability of vast {{parts of}} the Hindu Marriage Act, {{particularly}} the controversial 'Restitution of Conjugal Rights' clause.

5|$|The Convention <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> several principles. Most importantly, {{they agreed}} that the Convention should go beyond its mandate merely to amend the Articles of Confederation, and instead should produce a new {{constitution}} outright. While some delegates thought this illegal, the Articles of Confederation were closer to a treaty between sovereign states than they were to a national constitution, so the genuine legal problems were limited. Another principle they <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> <b>was</b> that the new government would have all {{the powers of the}} Confederation Congress, plus additional powers over the states. Once <b>agreeing</b> <b>on</b> these principles, the Convention voted on the Virginia plan and signaled their approval for it. Once this was done, they began modifying it.|$|R

50|$|Thus, by the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, two opposing schools of thought - Marxism and liberalism - believed in the possibility and the desirability of continual change and improvement.
