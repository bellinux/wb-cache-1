5|$|After the 1899 {{transfer}} {{of services to}} the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single Brown Marshall passenger carriage on the line; unlike other stations on the line, the platform height at Wood Siding was not raised <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> accommodate the new carriage. From 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day in each direction, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day. Following the 1899 {{transfer of}} services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day until closure in 1935.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Australian Corps {{was removed}} from the line for rest and {{training}} in preparation for further operations. In order {{to make up for the}} losses the Australians had suffered during the previous months, a number of Australian battalions were disbanded <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> provide reinforcements to those that remained. The 32nd Battalion received a large number of reinforcements from the all-Victorian 29th Battalion, which was subsequently disbanded. It was still out of the line when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. During the battalion's final series of battles, the battalion was led by Major Blair Wark, who was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his leadership and bravery.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the second}} bridge was {{interrupted}} several times by strikes, {{as well as by}} an algal bloom in the Swan River. The bridge was finally opened to traffic on 26 February 2001, and officially opened by new Transport Minister Alannah McTiernan (a strident critic of the project) on 30 May 2001. The bridge had originally been planned to be opened in August 2000, and was expected to carry 80,000 cars per day. The new traffic bridge carried six lanes of traffic, including one bus lane, and the original bridge was modified <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> carry six traffic lanes, as designed.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s British Railways (Southern Region) {{completed}} its Kent Coast Electrification schemes, {{which meant that}} most of the remaining services from the station were electrified, including boat trains. Some minor services were withdrawn, and the few remaining steam services, to Oxted and beyond, were replaced by diesel-electric multiple units. Various plans were proposed <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> redevelop Victoria, including new offices, hotels and a helicopter station. The last steam service left Victoria on 8 January 1964 to , after which it was replaced by diesel-electric multiple units.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{settlements}} {{had been}} established predominantly {{along the lines of}} the existing roads, and the principal villages were Stepney, Whitechapel and Bow. Settlements along the river began <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> service the needs of shipping on the Thames, but the City of London retained its right to actually land the goods. The riverside became more active in Tudor times, as the Royal Navy was expanded and international trading developed and downstream, a major fishing port developed at Barking to provide fish to the City. These and other factors meant that industries relating to construction, repair, and victualling of naval and merchant ships flourished in the area.|$|E

5|$|In Granville, NY22 was {{originally}} routed on Quaker, Main, and North streets. It was rerouted {{in the mid-1960s}} to bypass Granville on a new highway west of the village. NY149 was then extended northward along NY22's former routing to the junction of Main and North streets in Granville. From there, it continued eastward on Main Street to reach the Vermont state line, where it connected to VT30B, a spur route of VT30 {{that had been in}} place since 1935. Vermont renumbered VT30B to VT149 <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> match the highway it now connected to in New York.|$|E

5|$|Some {{historians are}} {{convinced}} that by 1964 Mikoyan believed that Khrushchev {{had turned into a}} liability to the Party, and that he was involved in the October 1964 coup that brought Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin to power. However, William Taubman disputes this, as Mikoyan was {{the only member of the}} Presidium (the name for the Politburo <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time)</b> <b>to</b> defend Khrushchev. Mikoyan, however, did vote to force Khrushchev's retirement (so as, in traditional Soviet style, to make the vote unanimous). Alone among Khrushchev's colleagues, Mikoyan wished the former leader well in his retirement, though he never spoke to him again. Mikoyan laid a wreath and sent a letter of condolence at Khrushchev's funeral in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The JTWC {{estimated}} Mala to {{have been}} a stronger system, with peak winds of 220km/h (140mph) and a pressure of 922mb (hPa; 27.23inHg)— equivalent to a Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Their Dvorak values peaked at T#6.5 or 235km/h (146mph). As the powerful storm approached Myanmar, the combined effects of increasing wind shear and land interaction soon took their toll on Mala. At 0700UTC on April29, Mala made landfall just south of Thandwe in Myanmar's Rakhine State as a very severe cyclonic storm. The JTWC estimated winds <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> have been 165km/h (105mph). Rapid weakening ensued once the cyclone moved onshore. Within 12hours of landfall, Mala weakened to a deep depression and was last noted as a dissipating system earl on April30.|$|E
5|$|The first {{nationalist}} incursion following UDI came in March 1966, when {{four small}} groups of ZANLA insurgents crossed the Zambezi near Chirundu. One team of seven cadres contacted the BSAP near the northern town of Sinoia on 28 April 1966 and was wiped out, the police killing all seven without taking casualties. On 16 May another of the ZANLA groups murdered a farmer, Johannes Viljoen, and his wife at their farm just north of Hartley. 1 Commando and the police were deployed on Operation Pagoda, which ended on 18 September 1966, the BSAP having done most of the work; as the local police commanders were reluctant <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> sign control over to the army, the RLI had been given little opportunity to act.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{designation}} {{was created}} in 1930 out of {{the southern end of}} US127. Three sets of reroutings through Adrian have resulted in the creation of two different business loops through the city. A change proposed in the 1960s and implemented in the 1970s shifted the southern end of US223 to replace M-151 and then run along the US23 freeway between Whiteford Township, Michigan, and Sylvania, Ohio. Since the 1980s, US223 no longer reaches Toledo, instead feeding into the freeway system for the city. Changes proposed and enacted into law in the 1990s would upgrade the highway as an Interstate Highway. Congress has designated this corridor as part of Interstate 73 (I-73), although neither state intends <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> complete the freeway.|$|E

She and her husband tried to sell the house immediately in 1946 to help pay the death duties.

5|$|The see of Canterbury seems <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{have been}} {{passing through a}} period of {{comparative}} obscurity. During Deusdedit's nine years as archbishop, all the new bishops in England were consecrated by Celtic or foreign bishops, with one exception: Deusdedit consecrated Damianus, Ithamar's successor as Bishop of Rochester. Deusdedit did, however, found a nunnery in the Isle of Thanet and helped with the foundation of Medeshamstede Abbey, later Peterborough Abbey, in 657. He was long overshadowed by Agilbert, bishop to the West Saxons, and his authority as archbishop probably did not extend past his own diocese and that of Rochester, which had traditionally been dependent on Canterbury.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the 2/15th {{remained}} on Brunei until November when it moved to Mempakul as personnel {{were returned to}} Australia in drafts based on priority of discharge. A small group of personnel volunteered <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> undertake occupation duties in Japan and were subsequently transferred to the 66th or 67th Battalions. In early December, the battalion's vehicles were returned and after the appropriate clearances were received, the remaining cadre was transported to Labuan. From there, they sailed back to Australia aboard the Pachaug Victory, arriving at Brett's Wharf, in Brisbane on 19 December. The cadre moved into a camp at Chermside, where they completed unloading of stores and equipment before a short Christmas leave. Early in the new year, the final administrative tasks were completed and the last group of personnel were posted for demobilisation and discharge. Finally, the 2/15th was officially disbanded on 21 January 1946.|$|E
5|$|Further {{discussion}} on altering the law {{took place in}} 1899, when several prominent cricketers supported an amendment similar to the 1888 proposal: the batsman would be out if the ball would have hit the wicket, where it pitched was irrelevant. At a Special General Meeting of the MCC in 1902, Alfred Lyttelton formally proposed this amendment; the motion was supported by 259 votes to 188, but failed to secure the two-thirds majority required to change the laws. A. G. Steel was the principal opponent of the change, as he believed {{it would make the}} task of the umpires too difficult, but he later regretted his stance. Lyttelton's brother, Robert, supported the alteration and campaigned {{for the rest of his}} life to have the lbw law altered. As evidence that pad-play was increasing and needed to be curtailed, he cited the growing number of wickets which were falling lbw: the proportion rose from 2% of dismissals in 1870 to 6% in 1890, and 12% in 1923. In 1902, the proposed new law was tried in the Minor Counties Championship, but deemed a failure. An increase in the size of the stumps was one of several other rejected proposals <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reduce the dominance of batsmen over bowlers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, NY31 was rerouted west {{of what is}} now NY429 to follow Ridge Road to Lewiston, where it ended at then-NY34. The former routing of NY31 into {{downtown}} Niagara Falls was redesignated as NY31A. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY31 was realigned east of Oneida Valley to continue east to Utica by way of its modern alignment plus Spring and Lowell Roads and several city streets. At the same time, NY3 was realigned to continue west to Niagara Falls over modern NY31, overlapping NY31A west of Sanborn. Two other portions of NY3—from the modern junction of NY31 and NY77 east of Lockport to Gasport and between Middleport and Medina—were also realigned <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> use modern NY31 and the old routing of legislative Route30 Spur along modern NY31E, respectively.|$|E
