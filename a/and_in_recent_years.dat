5|$|There are {{numerous}} bus operators within Sheffield: First South Yorkshire, Stagecoach Yorkshire, TM Travel, Hulleys of Baslow, Powells, G Holmes and Sheffield Community Transport. First South Yorkshire, became {{by far the}} largest bus operator <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> implemented a series of fare rises and service cuts which saw bus ridership drop. Recent developments have seen Stagecoach Sheffield taking over Yorkshire Terrier, Andrews and parent company Yorkshire Traction, thus forming one company and in the process expanding their bus services in the city. This has resulted in increased competition, and price drops on certain routes. A zero-fare bus service, the FreeBee (Operated by First South Yorkshire), operated a circular route around the city centre from the Sheffield Interchange. The FreeBee buses stopped in 2014 and is due to save £8 million.|$|E
5|$|John Thomas Perceval, {{the son of}} Spencer Perceval, {{spent about}} a year at Brislington House, from 1831 until February 1832, {{followed}} by two years at Ticehurst House, Ticehurst in Sussex. In Brislington House Perceval experienced, {{in spite of the}} expense, a regime of deprivation, brutality and degradation. For eight months, during which time he was completely under the control of his voices, spirits and presences, he was kept under restraint, either in a straitjacket or tied down in bed. Treatment consisted of cold baths and an operation to sever his temporal artery. He was later {{one of the founders of}} the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society and acted as their honorary secretary for about twenty years. Perceval's two books about his experience in asylums were republished by the anthropologist Gregory Bateson in 1962, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> he has been hailed as a pioneer of the mental-health advocacy movement.|$|E

5|$|SMAW welding, {{like other}} welding methods, {{can be a}} {{dangerous}} and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>years,</b> new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
