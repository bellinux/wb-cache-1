By six days after Isabel struck the state, all hospitals were opened and all roads excluding North Carolina Highway 12 were passable due to emergency crews clearing roads with debris. By about one month after the hurricane struck, 32,560 North Carolina residents applied for federal <b>assistance,</b> <b>with</b> disaster aid totaling about $50million (2003USD, ($ USD)).

5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier than}} the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for <b>assistance</b> <b>with</b> difficult tracheal intubation in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} Mikhail Gorbachev instituted glasnost, {{allowing}} greater {{freedom of speech}} and organization than ever before in the USSR. This openness generated a burst in women’s political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures. Additionally, women were aware that the new government would offer little <b>assistance</b> <b>with</b> their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had not developed systems of state recourse. Women began to form their own networks of resource sharing and emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations.|$|E

5|$|Joseph M. Pettit became {{president}} of the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1972.

Pettit has also received credit for shifting Georgia Tech back to its roots with regards to providing <b>assistance</b> <b>with</b> economic development within the state of Georgia. In the decades known for the Vietnam War and the launch of Sputnik, research at Georgia Tech and the Georgia Tech Research Institute had become so tied with NASA and the Department of Defense that local industrial development had been largely forgotten.|$|E

5|$|The general {{goal of a}} {{level is}} to gain control over every village on an island, {{accomplished}} through acts that persuade the villagers {{to believe in the}} player. Villagers can be swayed by everything from <b>assistance</b> <b>with</b> day-to-day tasks to being terrorised by fireballs and lightning storms. Artefacts (special objects that glow in their owner's colour) and missionary disciples can be used to impress villagers. Villagers become bored with repetitive attempts to impress them. For example, if boulders fly overhead too frequently, their effect is lost. This forces the player to use multiple methods to convert a village.|$|E

Before taking effect though, the Franco-Soviet pact {{was required to}} go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.
