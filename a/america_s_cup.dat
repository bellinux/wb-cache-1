This work will require a coupled fluid and structural simulation. Included in the simulation will be both a steadystate capability, to capture the quasi-state interactions between the air loads and sail geometry and the lift and drag on the boat, and a transient capability, to capture the sail/mast pumping effects resulting from hull motions...|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} deals principally {{with the}} redetermination {{of the limits}} of and the variability within the species of Spartina, a genus of grasses. Results of the study show the genus to be composed of sixteen species and two minor forms. Only one minor nomenclatorial change is proposed. Because the genus had not, heretofore, been properly typified, Spartina cynosuroides (L.) Roth is selected as the type species;The sixteen species are placed in three complexes on the basis of morphological similarity. Species of the first complex possess hard, slender culms and spikelike panicles composed of numerous, short, closely imbricate, twisted spikes. Rhizomes are usually wanting; if present, they are short and knotty. Spartina arundinacea of several South Atlantic and Indian Ocean islands, S. ciliate of southern South <b>America</b> and <b>S.</b> spartinae of North and South America are members of the first complex;The second complex consists of species with soft, fleshy, succulent culms; pilose pubescence on parts of the spikelets; and soft, flaccid rhizomes with inflated scales. The plants are usually limited to the inter tidal zone of coastal marshes. Species admitted to this complex are S. alterniflora of North and South <b>America</b> and Europe, <b>S.</b> foliosa of the Pacific coast of North <b>America,</b> <b>S.</b> longispica of the region near the mouth of the River Plate in South <b>America,</b> <b>S.</b> maritima of Europe and Africa, S. neyrautii of southwestern France and S. townsendii of England and France;Plants of the third complex are characterized by hard culms; non-spikelike panicles; usually spreading non-twisted spikes; and hispid pubescence on the spikelets. Most of the species possess firm rhizomes; the scales are not inflated. Species of the third complex are S. bakeri of salt and fresh water habitats in Florida and Georgia, S. x caespitosa of disturbed ground in and around coastal marshes from Maine to Maryland, S. cynosuroides of coastal marshes of eastern United States, S. densiflora of South <b>America,</b> <b>S.</b> gracilis of the western plains and mountains of North <b>America,</b> <b>S.</b> patens of the salt marshes in eastern United States and S. pectinata of transcontinental distribution in northern North America;Within several of the species (S. alterniflora, S. cynosuroides, S. patens, S. pectinata and S. spartinae) at least two levels of polyploidy have been found. In none of these species have suitable means been found for identifying the various levels of polyploidy except by chromosome numbers. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

It’s main objective is to allow those {{in charge of the}} Information and Technology department to be informed via email and beeper whenever the temperature in the server room exceeds one or several predetermined values. A PIC 16 F 877 micro-controller from Microchip 3 is used to gather the temperature from the digital sensors via polling. It also displays the value on an LCD and sends the information through an RS- 232 serial link to a PC. A DS 18 B 20 digital temperature sensor from Dallas Semiconductor 4 was utilized in this solution and its proprietary serial communication method know as “ 1 -Wire” was used to send the temperature value to the PIC micro-controller. This system employs a Windows application that allows the user to program the different alarms. This application was developed with Visual Basic version 6. 0. Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica.
