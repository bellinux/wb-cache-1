5|$|By October 1943, the fractious {{relationship}} came to {{the surface}} again. Galland met with Göring at Göring's estate, Schloss Veldenstein. During the conversation {{the need for new}} and improved interceptor aircraft arose. The demands made by Göring, that heavily cannon-armed fighters be used in mass numbers to defeat bomber formations, were unreasonable to Galland. Göring, prompted by the desires of Hitler, wanted cannons of some 2,000 lb in weight which fired at a rate of one shell per second. Galland explained that such a weapon could not be used effectively in an aircraft; the cannon would be prone to jamming and the aircraft would be too difficult to manoeuvre. Galland also asserted the use of inappropriate weaponry such as the Messerschmitt Me 410, a favourite of Hitler's, had caused heavy losses. Galland argued such measures were deplorable and irresponsible. Göring ignored Galland's arguments and continued his frequent attacks on the fighter force, accusing them of cowardice. Galland, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> did, defended them, risking his career and, {{near the end of the}} war, his life in doing so. Galland stated that he could not agree to follow Göring's plans and requested to be dismissed from his post and sent back to his unit. Göring accepted, but two weeks later he apologised to Galland and attributed his behaviour to stress. Galland continued in his post.|$|E
5|$|The vampires include: the Fool (voiced by Ron Funches), the Empress Eyes (voiced by Rebecca Romijn), the Hierophant (voiced by Paul Williams), the Moon (voiced by Beau Billingslea), and the Vampire King himself (voiced by Billy Brown). The vampires are {{surprised}} {{that they are}} alive again, but quickly disagree {{on what to do}} next and go off on their separate ways. Witnessing this, Jake warns Finn and Marceline. Upon realizing the Vampire King is alive again, Marceline flashes back to her previous battle with him. In order to preserve the vampire race, the Vampire King sacrificed himself to bite Marceline, making her the last vampire. Marceline manages to track down and confront the resurrected Vampire King, killing the Fool and reabsorbing his power of flight. However, before she can battle the still weak Vampire King, he warns her that the Empress is headed for the Ice Kingdom. Fearing {{for the safety of the}} Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), Marceline gives chase. The Empress arrives at the Ice Kingdom and uses her powers to hypnotize the Ice King, ordering him to bring her the blood of Finn. Marceline attempts to attack the Empress right as the Ice King returns with a captured Finn. Finn escapes, and the Empress orders Ice King to capture them. In an attempt to jog the Ice King's memory, Marceline tells him that she was motivated to start hunting vampires when she killed one trying to attack a human family. However, it's revealed that the Ice King was never hypnotized by the Empress, but merely acting <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> does around women. Marceline then attacks the Empress, but the Empress quickly gains the upper hand until she is paralyzed by a special gun Bubblegum developed. Marceline kills the Empress and reabsorbs her power of invisibility. She then apologizes to her friends for trying to fight the vampires alone and tells them they will hunt the remaining vampires together.|$|E
25|$|Gordon {{took part}} in the {{expedition}} to Kinburn, and returned to Sevastopol at the war's end. During the Crimean war, Gordon picked up an addiction to Turkish cigarettes which was to last for his rest of his life, and many commented that smoking was Gordon's most conspicuous vice <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> seemed to have a cigarette at his lips.|$|E
50|$|Asahi - At school, Asahi looks nerdy, <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> <b>always</b> wearing {{glasses and}} reading a book. He's {{a very kind}} person that always worries about others, {{sometimes}} to a ridiculous extent. He's {{in love with his}} childhood friend Manami. His dream is to become a lawyer.|$|R
5000|$|Jaques (...) {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{characters}} in Shakespeare's As You Like It. The 'Melancholy Jaques' <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> <b>always</b> being called is one of Duke Senior's noblemen who lives with him in the Forest of Arden. The role has long been a favorite for famous Shakespearean actors.|$|R

25|$|Moscati {{died in the}} {{afternoon}} of 12 April 1927. He had attended Mass that morning, receiving Communion <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> did, and spent {{the remainder of the}} morning at the hospital. Upon returning home he busied himself with patients until around three, after which, feeling tired, he sat down in an armchair in his office; soon after this, he died.|$|E
25|$|Amber Reeves {{attended}} Kensington High School until 1904, {{and then}} travelled to Europe to become fluent in French. Her {{father was not}} fully converted to the higher education of women; when {{he gave her the}} choice between being presented at court and going to the University of Cambridge, she chose Cambridge. Reeves then began studying Moral Sciences at Newnham College in 1905. It is unlikely her father raised further opposition <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> spoke highly of her academic achievements.|$|E
25|$|Wilson then remembers about Amelia's father, Lawrence; a drunk who {{has been}} overprotective of his {{daughter}} since her mother died. Lawrence hated Wilson, fearing that he will take away his daughter some day. After arriving at the river, Wilson recalls many summers he spent here, along with Amelia and Frank Dodd. The three often discussed their future, with Wilson and Frank both wanting to become pilots, and Amelia wanting to dance on Broadway. Years later Amelia asks Wilson to do the honorable thing and marry her, but fears what her father will do {{to him when he}} found out. Wilson is surprised about her request, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> thought that she would never marry him, but he is determined to make her dream become a reality.|$|E

He loves to play games and challenges guests to test their luck, usually ending in terrible mishaps and accidents for the players. For this reason, Gregory absolutely hates Roulette Boy <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> <b>always</b> haplessly landing on unlucky squares.|$|R

50|$|Vivian François {{is played}} by Wesley Duval. Probably the funniest {{character}} in the show <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> <b>always</b> drunk. <b>He</b> never leaves his bottle of whiskey and does not miss an opportunity {{to look at it}} with envy. It was also he who had found a wonderful idea to name his nephew François, which gives François François.|$|R
25|$|Pinkney L. Near (1927 - 1990) was {{curator of}} the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts for thirty years. He was {{responsible}} for the museum's acquisition of many treasured works of European art, including arranging for the museum to purchase from John Lee Pratt the Francisco Goya portrait of General Nicolas Guye (long believed to be the most valuable work of art in the museum's collections). The Guye portrait by Goya is now on view in the posthumously created Pinkney Near Gallery at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. In 1989 Pinkney Near was named to the newly created post of Paul Mellon Curator and senior research curator, a post in which he worked closely, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> had as chief curator, with the Mellon Collection and with Paul Mellon.|$|E
25|$|Rocco tells Fidelio {{that as soon}} as the {{governor}} has left for Seville, Marzelline and Fidelio can be married. He tells them, however, that unless they have money, they will not be happy. (Hat man nicht auch Gold beineben—"If you don't have money on you"). Fidelio demands to know why Rocco will not allow for help in the dungeons, especially <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> seems to return short of breath. Rocco says that there is a dungeon down there where he can never take Fidelio, which houses a man who has been wasting away for two years. Marzelline begs her father to keep Leonore away from such a terrible sight. Rocco and Leonore sing of courage (Gut, Söhnchen, gut—"All right, sonny, all right"), and Marzelline joins in their acclamations.|$|E
25|$|Numerous famous {{guests have}} {{stayed at the}} hotel. Claude Monet and James Whistler both stayed at the hotel and painted or drew views, from their rooms, of the River Thames. The Savoy {{featured}} prominently in guest Oscar Wilde's trial for gross indecency. Other celebrity guests in the hotel's early decades included the future King Edward VII, Sarah Bernhardt, Enrico Caruso, Lillie Langtry, H. G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw, Nellie Melba, Charlie Chaplin, Al Jolson, Errol Flynn, Fred Astaire, Marlene Dietrich, Lionel Barrymore, Harry Truman, Audrey Hepburn, Judy Garland, Josephine Baker, Cary Grant, Babe Ruth, Ivor Novello and Noël Coward. The hotel kept records of its guests' preferences, {{so that it could}} provide for them in advance. For Coward, the staff made history by taking the first photographs of a hotel guest's toilet articles so that they could lay them out in his bathroom exactly as he liked them. They made sure to provide a fireproof eiderdown quilt to Barrymore, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> smoked while reading in bed.|$|E

500|$|One {{day when}} we were living at Kawaihae my {{grandmother}} went to Hulihee to see Kuakini, who was not well. I went with her and when Kinau saw me he chased me <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> did. I think {{he did not like}} me. I ran to my grandmother and she protected me. Kuakini saw me and said to my grandmother to let the haole go and told us to [...] "hakaka" [...] (fight). She did and we fought. I beat him. Kuakini made fun of Kinau who was about six years old then.|$|E
500|$|Following the show's {{cancellation}} in 2002, Rogen did not {{get many}} auditions, which was not upsetting to him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> thought he would achieve better success as a writer. He would soon {{be a part of}} Apatow's [...] "frat pack", a close-knit group that includes Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. Of the awkwardness of a grown man spending so much time with a teenaged Rogen, Apatow said: [...] "I'm such a comedy fan that, even though he's16, I know I'm hanging out with one of the guys who's {{going to be one of}} the great comics." [...] Around this time, Apatow would come up with odd requests for Rogen and Goldberg, such as turn an idea of his into a movie in 10 days and come up with 100 one-page ideas for films. Regarding Apatow's professional effect on Rogen, the actor said in 2009, [...] "Obviously, I can't stress how important Judd's been to my career".|$|E
500|$|He {{started the}} 1961–62 season behind Hill in the pecking order, only getting his place {{back in time}} for a 4–0 win over Chelsea after Hill picked up an injury.

It was a fitting final bow <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> enjoyed playing against Arsenal, and he had [...] "so many wonderful memories" [...] at Highbury. With former teammate and close friend Jackie Mudie at Stoke City, and with Tony Waddington keen to welcome Matthews back to the Victoria Ground, his return to his home-town club was sealed. However Matthews was not impressed when the Blackpool board demanded a £3,500 transfer fee, with one director being so bold as to tell him [...] "You forget. As a player, we made you." [...] Having kept secret from Stoke a niggling knee injury Matthews had been carrying, Blackpool got their £3,500 for the player.|$|E

500|$|Ruth Deller of {{entertainment}} website Lowculture commented on Paul stating: [...] "He's {{always been a}} bit of a ladies' man and has had an eye for a business deal and has always struggled with whether to be good Paul or bad Paul. Ramsay Street's most prolific marry-er and father-er." [...] She also criticises the fact Paul's false leg is never shown on-screen adding: [...] "Paul has a wooden leg, which sometimes causes him to limp, when he remembers about it." [...] Holy Soap have said that Paul starting the Lassiter's fire and killing Gus during his 2004 return, was one of soap opera's greatest comebacks. They also branded him a [...] "legendary figure" [...] of Neighbours. Josephine Monroe in her book Neighbours: The first 10 years, names Paul one of soap opera's most enduring characters. An Inside Soap writer opined that [...] "slimy seducer" [...] Paul remained the same [...] "eighties smooth operator", observing [...] "he's certainly not short of a slick chat-up line or two.

500|$|... "Half a Life" [...] {{was first}} {{released}} within the United States on May 6, 1991, in broadcast syndication. Keith DeCandido, {{in a review}} for Tor.com, commended Stiers' acting, saying that he gave [...] "a noble, nuanced performance as Timicin." [...] He also approved of the episode, {{saying that it was}} the first time that Lwaxana Troi was treated as a real character without causing him to cringe; at the same time, DeCandido did not forget the problems with her previous appearances on the show. Noting [...] that it was one of the best episodes to feature a Prime Directive debate, DeCandido endorsed the writer's idea not to take sides regarding the suicide. [...] "This is a magnificent, tragic love story, one that takes a thin character and gives her depth, one that gives us a beautifully realized guest character in Timicin (casting Stiers was a masterstroke, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> brings subtle nuance to his roles), and one that takes its issues seriously," [...] DeCandido wrote. He gave the episode a score of eight out of ten, later concluding that it featured [...] "one of the show's most tragic love stories." ...|$|E
500|$|Sorkin's nearly decade-long {{collaboration}} in television with director Thomas Schlamme began in early 1998 {{when they found}} they shared common creative ground on the soon to be produced Sports Night. Their successful partnership in television {{is one in which}} Sorkin focuses on writing the scripts while Schlamme executive produces and occasionally directs; they have worked together on Sports Night, The West Wing, and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. Schlamme will create the look of the shows, work with the other directors, discuss the scripts with Sorkin as soon as they are turned in, make design and casting decisions, and attend the budget meetings; Sorkin tends to stick strictly to writing. In response to what he perceived as unfair criticism of The Newsroom, Jacob Drum of Digital Americana wrote, [...] "The essential truth that the critics miss is that The Newsroom is Sorkin being Sorkin <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> has been and always will be: one part pioneer; one part self-conscious romantic; two parts actual Lewis & Clark-style pioneer, trapping his way across an old, old idea of an America that can always stand to raise its game—but most importantly, spinning a good yarn while he does so." ...|$|E

He is also the adoptive brother of A, the current Raikage, and as such, is {{expected}} to be the guardian of the village. In battle, he uses its great strength to increase the lethality of his professional wrestling-styled attacks, something [...] Kishimoto's former editor wanted to add in the series despite him being a ninja. He is also a talented swordsman, capable of using up to seven swords at once and to execute attacks that are unpredictable enough to render Sasuke's Sharingan useless. When Akatsuki attacks him, he pretends to be captured to escape at the cost of losing some of Gyūki's chakra and pursue a career as an enka music singer. However, Killer Bee is brought back to Kumogakure, playing a role in teaching Naruto how to control Kurama's power. He also becomes Naruto's primary partner in the war against the Akatsuki after gaining his brother's approval to fight alongside him, eventually losing Gyūki to Madara. However, Killer Bee survived the extracting by holding on to a piece of Gyūki's tentacle and later becomes the Eight Tails Jinchuriki again in the aftermath of the war.
