5|$|Casey {{returned}} to Washington, D.C. in October 1940 to become {{chief of the}} Design and Engineering Section in the Construction Division of the Office of the Quartermaster General, under Brigadier General Brehon B. Somervell. An enormous construction program was underway {{to meet the needs}} of World War II. Working with a staff that included George Bergstrom, <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> the American Institute of Architects, Casey set about revising the standard designs for barracks. A number of new features were added to improve comfort, safety, and durability. Substitutions were made for scarce materials. It was discovered that the standard 63-man barracks was now too small. Of the 81 companies in the new triangular division, 51 fitted more easily into 74-man barracks. By slightly increasing the barracks size, substantial savings were made by reducing the overall number of buildings that needed to be constructed, the size of the cantonment areas required, and the length of required roads and utility lines. Casey was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 8 April 1941.|$|E
