40|$|Resonant {{absorbers}} {{based on}} plasmonic materials, metamaterials, and thin films enable spectrally selective <b>absorption</b> <b>filters,</b> where <b>absorption</b> is maximized at the resonance wavelength. By controlling the geometrical parameters of nano/microstructures and materials' refractive indices, resonant absorbers {{are designed to}} operate at wide range of wavelengths for applications including <b>absorption</b> <b>filters,</b> thermal emitters, thermophotovoltaic devices, and sensors. However, once resonant absorbers are fabricated, it is rather challenging to control and tune the spectral absorption response. Here, we propose and demonstrate thermally tunable infrared resonant absorbers using hybrid gold-vanadium dioxide (VO 2) nanostructure arrays. Absorption intensity is tuned from 90 % to 20 % and 96 % to 32 % using hybrid gold-VO 2 nanowire and nanodisc arrays, respectively, by heating up the absorbers above the phase transition temperature of VO 2 (68 °C). Phase change materials such as VO 2 deliver useful means of altering optical properties {{as a function of}} temperature. Absorbers with tunable spectral response can find applications in sensor and detector applications, in which external stimulus such as heat, electrical signal, or light results in a change in the absorption spectrum and intensity. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R

An alternative way is based on the filters such as interference filters, plasmonic nanoresonators, or quantum dots. However, for any of the above two spectrometers, the high-precision grating or the <b>absorption</b> <b>filter</b> should be elaborately designed and makes it expensive. Here, we propose a third spectrometer principle-pupil diffraction spectrometer (PDS). Since the high-precision grating and the elaborately designed <b>absorption</b> <b>filter</b> are abandoned, the whole structure of the PDS is just as simple as a CCD detector. Thus, compared with the above two spectrometer, the structure of the spectrometer is greatly simplified and the cost of the spectrometer is sharply reduced.

A series of simulation results are shown to demonstrate the feasibility of the PDS principle. Further, the effectiveness of the PDS principle in the noisy condition is also tested. Owing to this merits small size, light weight, and low cost, we expect the inventions of PDS has great application potential such as putting on the satellite to perform space exploration, and integrates to the smartphone to realize the detection pesticide residue in the food and clinical diagnose of the disease.
