40|$|ABSTRACT: The cation {{exchange}} capacity (C. E.

The base-titratable acidities of the acid nontronite, freshly prepared as well as aged, were found to be greater than the acidities extractable with 1 N NaCI; the difference was attributed to the non-exchangeable pH-dependent com-ponent of C. E. C. In the freshly prepared sample, H + and Fe 3 + ions were the only exchangeable cations. Ageing produced basic Fe ions which were exchangeable and whose amount increased at the cost of H- and Fe 3 + ions. Whatever the age, the total quantity of these xchangeable cations corresponding to the total isomorphous charge, remained constant. The amount of the pH-dependent acidity also remained unchanged.

The equilibrium modelled data fitted well with the linear forms of both the Langmuir and the Freundlich models (R 2 = 0. 99 in both cases).

The samples selected {{for this study were}} naturally occuring clays from Ankara and Eskiehir regions. The acid activated zeolite was also used for the purpose to compare its bleaching performance with commercial bleaching clay, Tonsil and the <b>acid</b> activated <b>clays.</b> The clay minerals were activated with hydrochloric acid (HCl) at three acid concentrations (1 N, 3 N, 5 N), activation times (1 h, 2 h, 3 h) and different dry clay/acid ratios. The clay samples from the Ankara and Eskiehir regions were defined as montmorillonite according to X- ray diffraction (XRD). XRD results proved that acid activation caused structural changes in the treated montmorillonites, montmorillonite peaks gradually disappearing and yielding to an amorphous montmorillonite structure. The TGA results showed a significant weight loss between 30 C - 200 C (15 %) for the Ankara clay and between 20 - 200 (12 %) for the Eskiehir clay. This was most probably due to the removal of free and hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Maximum surface area was obtained for the <b>acid</b> activated Ankara <b>clay</b> treated with 1 N HCl for 3 hours. It was determined to be 849. 1 m 2 /g. Also, maximum surface area was 269. 7 m 2 /g for the <b>acid</b> activated Eskiehir <b>clay</b> treated with 5 N HCl for 1 hour. Then the surface area of the <b>acid</b> activated <b>clays</b> decreased sharply with the acid activation. The chemical compositions of the solutions and <b>clays</b> after <b>acid</b> activation were determined using ICP and EDX analysis, respectively. According to the results, the dissolution amount of CaO, Na 2 O, MgO, K 2 O, Fe 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 increased along with increasing acid concentration and treatment time. The SiO 2 content and the Si 02 /Al 2 O 3 ratio increased as a result of dissolving of aluminium ions. This ratio increased from 6. 0 to 7. 5 for the <b>acid</b> activated Eskiehir <b>clay</b> and from 2. 7 to 3. 9 for <b>acid</b> activated Ankara <b>clay.</b> <b>Acid</b> activated <b>clays</b> were tested for the assessment of their bleaching efficiency for sunflower oil in the laboratory. Bleaching tests were carried out with earths prepared at different acid activation conditions such as acid concentration and activation times. The absorbance value was measured at 455 nm and found to be 0. 429 for the neutralized sunflower oil. Peroxide value and free-fatty acid content of the neutralized oil were found to be 16. 8 meq/kg and 0. 07 %, respectively. The oil bleached with the <b>acid</b> activated Ankara <b>clay</b> had a peroxide value of 46. 2 meq/kg first, which decreased to 22. 4 meq/kg and the free-fatty acid content was observed to be around 0. 08 %. For <b>acid</b> activated Eskiehir <b>clay,</b> peroxide value of the bleached oil initially increased up to 31. 2 meq/kg, then decreased under the peroxide value of neutralized oil (16. 8 meq/kg) and free-fatty acid content of bleached oil approximately was around 0. 09 %. The bleaching parameters which were used for testing were 1 % earth concentration and 30 minutes contact time at 100 °C bleaching temperature. At these selected parameters, <b>acid</b> activated Eskiehir <b>clay</b> (5 N 1 h HCl treatment), Ankara clay (1 N 3 h HCl treatment) and zeolite (2 N 6 h HNO 3 treatment) were compared with the commercial bleaching clay, Tonsil. The smallest value of absorbance and bleaching efficiency were found to be 0. 084 and 80 %, respectively with the Eskiehir clay and these values were determined to be 0. 083 and 81 % with the Tonsil under the same conditions. The absorbance value and bleaching efficiency of the bleached oil with <b>acid</b> activated Ankara <b>clay</b> were determined to be 0. 114 and 73 %, respectively using the selected bleaching parameters. Bleaching performance of Ankara clay was found to be lower when compared with the result of Eskiehir clay. At the selected bleaching point, results of lovibond red and yellow color of bleached oil indicated that the Eskiehir clay and Tonsil were close to each other in bleaching efficiency (Red color: 0. 8 and 1. 1; yellow color: 20 and 20 for Tonsil and Eskiehir clay, respectively). Zeolite did not reach the required bleaching performance. The bleaching efficiency was 25 % with raw zeolite and it hardly increased to 46 % with the acid activated zeolite. In addition, red and yellow color values were higher than the other clays (red color: 2. 6; yellow color: 30). As a result, Eskiehir clay gave a better bleaching performance compared to Ankara clay and Zeolite. Maximum bleaching efficiency was achieved after 30 minutes of contact time with 1 % earth concentration at 100 °C bleaching temperature following 5 N 1 h HCl treatment for Eskiehir clay...|$|R

Sorption and desorption of 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol (2, 4, 6 -TCP) by and from humic acid-modified K+- and Ca 2 +-montmorillonite and -illite were compared with unmodified clays using batch equilibration methods. Commercial humic acid and the humic acid extracted from forest soil were employed in this experiment. The adsorbed amount of 2, 4, 6 -TCP by commercial humic acid was almost twice as large as that adsorbed by the extracted soil humic acid. More 2, 4, 6 -TCP was sorbed onto K+- and Ca 2 +-illite than onto K+- and Ca 2 +- montmorillonite. K+ clays were more effective in adsorbing 2, 4, 6 -TCP than Ca 2 + clays. Sorption of 2, 4, 6 -TCP on humic acid-modified Ca 2 +- and K+-montmorillonite and -illite increased as compared with unmodified clays. The sorption nonlinearity of 2, 4, 6 -TCP on humic acid-modified Ca 2 +- and K+-illite increased remarkably as compared with the unmodified clays. The sorption nonlinearity of 2, 4, 6 -TCP on humic acid-modified Ca 2 +- and K+-montmorillonite increased slightly in contrast to unmodified montmorillonites.

Non-peptide fraction (carbonyl compound) gave despeptide actinomycin C as acetyl derivative and red crystals, showed m. p. 204 - 205 ℃ (decomp.). and λmax. at 232 mμ and 255 mμ in benzene solution, and its 2, 4 -dinitro-phenyl hydrazine derivative showed m. p. 111 - 113 ℃...|$|E
40|$|The {{rates of}} pH-change of some neutral salt solutions, {{mixed with the}} <b>acid</b> <b>clay,</b> were measured, at 5 O℃ and 100 ℃, under the same {{condition}} of stirring, by both the electric and colorimetric methods. The neutral salt used were the sulphates of sodium and potassium, and the chlorides of potassium and barium, their concentrations (C) being 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3 and 0. 4 N. 　The following results were obtained. (1) At the equilibrium, the isothermal [H+]-[H+]_ 0 =kc^n holds good, where [H+] is the epuilibrium concentration of hydrogen ion, [H+]_ 0, its initial values and k and n are constants depending on the natures of materials and the temperature. (2) This formula reminds of the Freundlich 2 ̆ 7 s sorption isothermal and suggests that [H+]-[H+]_ 0 {{is equivalent to the}} amount of cation of neutral salt which is sorped by the clay. (3) The heats of activation under the same conditions were 17 - 18 Cals per mol for sulphates and 8 - 9 for chlorides. From these values it may be suggested that the rate determining step for the total pH-change reaction is not the diffusion of cations of the neutral salts, nor the dissolution of the Al-ion in the clay, but the change of chemical linkago...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>clays</b> {{prepared}} by electrodialysis or by treatement with dilute (< about 0. 1 N) mineral acid solutions were largely Al-saturated, {{and had little}} catalytic effect on ester hydrolysis and sucrose inversion. On the other hand, clays exhaustively treated with cold 1 N HC 1 were largely H-saturated, and served as effective H-ion catalysts. When various quantities of clay were used as catalysts, reaction rates + were proportional to the concentration of H-ions in the system. H-montmorillonites prepared from Plymouth, Utah bentonite and from Volclay bentonite were from 50 to 200 percent more effective catalysts for ethyl acetate,hy-drolysis than was HC 1. For sucrose inversion, < 2 t ~ H-clays had a somewhat greater catalytic effect han did HC 1, while clay aggregates were much less effective catalysts. For ester hydrolysis, the degree of dispersion of the clay made little difference in its catalytic activity...|$|R
40|$|Cengar Natural clay was {{calcined}} at 700 °C for 3 {{hours and}} the clay was extracted usingsulfuric acid with various of concentration (0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 6 moles) at 30 o C for 1 hour for liquid coagulant synthesis. The by product of liquid coagulant production was the sulfuric <b>acid</b> activated Cengar <b>clay</b> {{which have been}} used in this study. The sulfuric <b>acid</b> activated Cengar <b>clay</b> solids was heated at 230 °C for 5 hours. The activated Cengar clay were characterized to determine the mineral types and ratio Si/Al. Characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD) has shown a mineral of bassanite in clay at every moles of sulfuric acid, where as the types of clay mineral that only calcined at 700 oC for 3 hours (LC 700) were kaolinite, muscovite, monmorilonite, calcite and quartz. Ratio Si/Al in each of the sulfuric <b>acid</b> activated <b>clays</b> LC 700 - 0, 2, LC 700 - 0, 4 and LC 700 - 0, 6 were 7, 76, 10, 75 and 23, 76, while non activated clay LC 700 was 6, 08. It is concluded that the activated clay was potential to be used as an adsorbent...|$|R
40|$|From x-ray studies, mixed-layer {{minerals}} can {{be classified}} into regular and random types; the former show a long spacing of about 30 A. Certain clays showing strong powder eflec-tions from long spacings have been considered in detail after treatment with ethylene glycol and/or ignition. Kurata clay and Hanaoka clay no. 908, showing 29. 6 __ _ 0. 2 A spacing, are composed of the following three kinds of lattices: (a) the usual montmorillonite lattice with the cell height of 15. 4 A (M-lattice), (b) the kaolin mineral attice with cell height of about 7 A (K-lattice), (c) a new lattice with a cell height of 14 A (G-lattice) which is represented by a regular interstratification between pyrophyllite and gibbsite layers, tn these clays M-and G-lattices form partly a regular mixed-layer structure with a 29. 6 A spacing and partly a random mixed-layer structure. Hanaoka clay no. 308, showing a 26. 6 ___ 0. 2 A spac-ing, is composed ofa lattice with cell height of 12 A and a chlorite lattice; these form a regu-lar mixed-layer mineral with the long spacing. A random mixed-layer mineral is found in some so-called <b>acid</b> <b>clays.</b> These clays have very broad basal reflections howing random mixed-layer complexes and having almost equal percentages of kaolinite and montmorillonite layers. The thermal curves and electron micrographs of these clays are discussed...|$|R
