40|$|This study {{deals with}} a {{literary}} analysis. The writer <b>analyzes</b> the theme of The Moon and Sixpence written by William Somerset Maugham. She <b>analyzes</b> it through three elements of novel namely character, plot and setting. In <b>analyzing</b> the main character of the novel, she uses psychological approach based on Maslow theory, stratified needs. In <b>analyzing</b> the main character, the writer divides into two parts. First is about Strickland's personality when he {{is known as a}} family man, an amateur painter in Paris and a painter in Tahiti. Second is about Strickland's life in the need for self-actualization states. She also introduces some other characters that have relationships with the main character. In finding theme through plot, the writer starts the <b>analyzing</b> by introducing all of the characters in the novel, then she <b>analyzes</b> the conflict happened between the main character and some others. After that she <b>analyzes</b> the suspense, climax and resolution related to the conflict After <b>analyzing</b> plot, the writer <b>analyzes</b> the setting. She <b>analyzes</b> places and activities in which some important action take place. At last, she <b>analyzes</b> the theme of The Moon and Sixpence. As the result of the analysis, the writer concludes that the main character, Strickland, is a man in the self-actualization need that causes him to feel the need to do something well for the sake of doing it well. Through the <b>analyzes</b> of the main character, plot and setting, she finds that the theme of the novel is the desire of a man to fulfill his dream or destiny can conquer anything...|$|R

5|$|Phillip Manning {{and colleagues}} (2009) {{attempted}} {{to test the}} function of the sickle claw and similarly shaped claws on the forelimbs. They <b>analyzed</b> the bio-mechanics of how stresses and strains would be distributed along the claws and into the limbs, using X-ray imaging to create a three-dimensional contour map of a forelimb claw from Velociraptor. For comparison, they <b>analyzed</b> the construction of a claw from a modern predatory bird, the eagle owl. They found that, based on the way that stress was conducted along the claw, they were ideal for climbing. The scientists found that the sharpened tip of the claw was a puncturing and gripping instrument, while the curved and expanded claw base helped transfer stress loads evenly.|$|E
