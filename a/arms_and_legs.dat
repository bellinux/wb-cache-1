5|$|Martin {{checked out}} and {{returned}} to Singapore on 19 March. On that day the skulls of the Damudes were found in a disused tin mine in Kathu district. A torso and a pair each of <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> were found along Bahn Nai Trang Road, 9.7kilometres (6mi) away, five days later. The body parts were so badly decomposed that visual identification was impossible; Royal Thai Police used dental records to identify the skulls and forensic analysis concluded that the torso, <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> {{were likely to be}} Sheila's. The other parts of Darin's body were never found.|$|E
5|$|Seneb's {{dwarfism}} {{is depicted}} realistically in the sculpture. It portrays {{him with a}} large head but small <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs.</b> This possibly indicates that he had achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism that most severely affects the fastest-growing {{parts of the body}} – particularly the femur and humerus, which become short and squat – and stunts the forearms and lower legs. It also affects the head, producing a relatively large skull with a bulging forehead and often a depressed nasal bridge. An alternative diagnosis is dysmelia – a condition that produces short <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs.</b> Seneb's wife Senites is portrayed far less realistically; her depiction is of a piece with other contemporary portraits of high-ranking Egyptian women.|$|E
5|$|As MalcolmX and his bodyguards {{tried to}} quell the disturbance, a man rushed forward and shot him once in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun and two other men charged the stage firing {{semi-automatic}} handguns. MalcolmX was pronounced dead at 3:30pm, shortly after arriving at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. The autopsy identified 21 gunshot wounds to the chest, left shoulder, <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs,</b> including ten buckshot wounds from the initial shotgun blast.|$|E

5|$|Tony Gardner ({{designer}}) and {{his company}} Alterian, Inc. were hired to design and create the look of Edna Turnblad on John Travolta. Costume designer Rita Ryack wanted to put Edna into several revealing outfits, so Travolta ended up being encapsulated in prosthetics. He wore silicone prosthetics {{on his head and}} neck, and foam latex <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> that connected to a spandex and foam body suit.|$|E
5|$|Unlike galagos, {{which have}} longer legs than arms, slow lorises have <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> of nearly equal length. Their intermembral index (ratio of arm to leg length) averages 89, {{indicating}} that their forelimbs are slightly shorter than their hind limbs. As with the slender lorises, their arms are slightly longer than their body, but the extremities of slow lorises are more stout.|$|E
5|$|While {{awaiting}} his execution, Bonnet {{wrote to}} Governor Johnson, begging abjectly for clemency and promising {{to have his}} own <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> cut off as assurance {{that he would never}} again commit piracy. Charles Johnson wrote that Bonnet's visibly disintegrating mind moved many Carolinians to pity, particularly the female population, and London papers later reported that the governor delayed his execution seven times. Bonnet was eventually hanged at White Point Garden, in Charles Town, on 10December 1718.|$|E

5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of the}} back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E
5|$|Other {{aspects of}} feeding include the eyes, <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs.</b> The {{shape of the}} skull of Allosaurus limited {{potential}} binocular vision to 20° of width, slightly {{less than that of}} modern crocodilians. As with crocodilians, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks. The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close, and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things. Finally, the top speed of Allosaurus has been estimated at 30 to 55kilometers per hour (19 to 34miles per hour).|$|E
5|$|Potbelly monuments are {{generally}} crude in-the-round sculptures of extremely fat human figures; {{they are usually}} seated cross-legged and have enormous swollen stomachs gripped in the figure's <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs.</b> The heads are round and normally have the eyes closed and possess puffy eyelids and prominent lips. The monuments {{are generally}} of indeterminate gender and are usually carved from porphyritic basalt, a kind of rock {{with a combination of}} large and small grains of mineral that is common along the foothills of Central America. There are occasional examples of potbelly figures crafted from other materials, such as pottery or from other types of rock.|$|E

40|$|The most {{commonly}} used propulsion method for handcycling is moving the arms symmetrically. Previous studies indicated that during outdoor handcycling symmetrical arm movements are more efficient. During locomotor movements, however, arm movements are performed asymmetrically in combination with leg movements.

5|$|TISM {{have used}} a variety of methods to conceal their identities. They have never officially {{revealed}} their names, instead choosing to use pseudonyms on their records and in interviews, all the while concealing their faces. Usually this involves the wearing of a balaclava, but outrageous costumes have been created for the purpose, including Ku Klux Klan uniforms made of newspaper, silver suits with puffy <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> to mimic an inflated cask wine bladder, giant foam paintings worn on the head, large foam signs bearing the name of a Beatle, fat 'businessman' suits, and eight-foot-high inflatable headpieces among others.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E
5|$|Coelurus {{is known}} {{from most of}} the {{skeleton}} of a single individual, including numerous vertebrae, partial pelvic and shoulder girdles, and much of the <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs,</b> stored at the Peabody Museum of Natural History; however, the relative completeness of the skeleton was not known until 1980. The fossils were recovered from Reed's Quarry 13 at Como Bluff, Wyoming. Additionally, two arm bones possibly belonging to this genus are known from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah. It was not a large dinosaur. Its weight has been estimated at around , with a length of about 2.4meters (7.9ft) and a hip height of 0.7meters (2.3ft). From reconstructions of the skeleton, Coelurus had a relatively long neck and torso due to its long vertebrae, a long slender hindlimb due to its long metatarsus, and potentially a small slender skull.|$|E

5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{have two}} pairs of mammae, one on the chest (pectoral) {{and one on the}} abdomen (abdominal). Their fur is {{typically}} grayish-brown on the dorsal (back) side and more gray in color on the ventral (front) side. The tail is typically black-tipped. The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color, along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the dorsal side of the <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs.</b> This population also has a red tail, which darkens at the end. Vibrissae are found above the eyes (superciliary), above the mouth (buccal), under the lower jaw (genal), {{near the top of the}} jaw (interramal), and on the wrist (carpal). Like mouse lemurs, the ears are large and membranous.|$|E
5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs,</b> while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
5|$|Rapists of virgins and {{children}} are also attested to have been buried alive, with a stake driven through them. In one such judicial tradition, the rapist was {{to be placed in}} an open grave, and the rape victim was ordered to make the three first strokes on the stake herself; the executioners then finishing the impalement procedure. Serving {{as an example of the}} fate of a child molester, in August 1465 in Zurich, Switzerland, Ulrich Moser was condemned to be impaled, for having sexually violated six girls between the ages four and nine. His clothes were taken off, and he was placed on his back. His <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> were stretched out, each secured to a pole. Then a stake was driven through his navel down into the ground. Thereafter, people left him to die.|$|E

5|$|Sasuke {{was also}} the most {{difficult}} character for Kishimoto to draw. He felt that his drawings tended to make Sasuke look too old, {{a result of his}} inexperience in drawing younger characters mature beyond their years. Sasuke's hair, originally kept short to save Kishimoto time, slowly grew longer as the series has progressed. Midway through Part I, Kishimoto drew a new costume for Sasuke featuring a number of belts strapped around his <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs,</b> but because it took too long to draw, he returned to Sasuke's original costume design. Despite the time and energy Kishimoto spends drawing Sasuke, he has become his favorite character to draw. He ranked Sasuke alongside Sakura in terms of drawing difficulty. In some cases, his superiors even asked Kishimoto to redraw parts of the manga that did not illustrate Sasuke well.|$|E
5|$|The {{relief is}} in a {{dilapidated}} condition {{with most of}} the <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> broken. He is seated in padmasana lost in his meditation. His posture is well formed and suggests that the 6th century artist knew this asana. He sits on a lotus with a stalk shown as if coming out of the earth, his legs are crossed symmetrically. Two Nagas flank the lotus and express their reverence with a namaste posture. The great yogi is being approached by various Vedic and Puranic gods and goddesses, as well as monks and sadhus, yet there is a halo around him that keeps them at bay, as if they admire it but do not wish to disturb his meditation.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} from LEMS typically {{involves the}} muscles of the proximal <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>legs</b> (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).|$|E
