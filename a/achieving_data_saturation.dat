40|$|The {{qualitative}} research “gold standard” for quality research is data saturation. The limited literature on reporting data saturation and transparency in {{qualitative research}} has supported an inconsistent research standard suggesting researchers have not adequately reported data saturation to promote transparency (O’Reilly 2 ̆ 6 Parker, 2012). Confusion regarding how to analyze qualitative data to achieve data saturation, {{how to write}} clear qualitative research findings, and present these findings in a usable manner continues (Sandelowski 2 ̆ 6 Leeman, 2012). A phenomenological asynchronous online focus group using WordPress® was employed to answer the research question. Based on the current literature {{on the topic of}} focus group data saturation, the study findings were analyzed by group, individual, and day of the study. Additionally, the data was presented in a chart format providing a visible approach to data analysis and saturation. Employing three different methods of data analysis to confirm saturation and transparency provides qualitative researchers with different approaches to data analysis for saturation and enhancement of trustworthiness. Placing data in a visual configuration provides an alternative method of presenting research findings. The data analysis methods presented are not meant to replace existing methods of <b>achieving</b> <b>data</b> <b>saturation</b> but to provide an alternate approach to <b>achieving</b> <b>data</b> <b>saturation</b> and reporting the findings in a clear, usable forma...|$|E
30|$|Our {{results should}} be {{interpreted}} in light of several limitations. First, {{this study was conducted}} in a single hospital, potentially limiting the generalizability of findings. This is a limitation common to all single-site studies, qualitative and quantitative. The goal of qualitative research is to advance social theory by designing research rigorously that accounts for the unique perspectives of subjects and researchers through robust data analysis, not to posit cause-effect relationships as in statistically-based quantitative research (Mays and Pope 2000). We situate our work within this tradition by presenting the range of stakeholder opinions on cultural competence at one community hospital. At the same time, we have striven for representativeness by enrolling all relevant stakeholders. Intervention studies that are intended to change human behavior often narrowly select participants and apply narrowly specified strategies that can limit the representativeness of results (Glasgow et al. 2004). Our study aimed for representativeness by broadly enrolling patients, clinicians, and administrators with minimal exclusion criteria and encouraging them to brainstorm strategies for changing human behavior rather than asking them to apply strategies determined by the researchers beforehand. Future qualitative research could explore whether our findings on cultural competence converge or diverge from findings in other clinics. Second, existing relationships among clinicians and administrators could have influenced interactions. Although no single participant dominated any group, perceptions of influence may have encouraged some to participate more than others. Third, we followed methodologists in using theoretical sampling to <b>achieve</b> <b>data</b> <b>saturation.</b> There is no consensus among focus group methodologists on the numbers of participants needed to <b>achieve</b> <b>data</b> <b>saturation</b> among methodologists (Carlsen and Glenton 2011). We believe that our findings exhibit candor and exhaust the range of responses, including contradictions among participants, indicating that we have <b>achieved</b> <b>data</b> <b>saturation.</b>|$|R

Theoretical sampling <b>achieves</b> <b>data</b> <b>saturation</b> quicker than convenience or random sampling {{based on the}} assumption of a group’s coherence (Morse 1995). Two forms of data justified theoretical sampling by stakeholder in this study. First, these three groups are differentially impacted by health interventions (Damschroder et al. 2009; Llerena-Quinn 2013). Second, the first author met with clinicians and administrators before initiating the study, and they asked for separate groups to speak freely without repercussions. Compared to individual interviews or expert consensus panels (Kitzinger 1995; Morgan 1996), focus groups uniquely allowed us to observe how participants query and explain cultural competence to each other.|$|R

Results: Patients and their family’s experiences included 7 main themes: lack of special education for healthcare providers, preferences, financial problems, health care quality, lack of providing information to patients and their families, limitation in life due to disease, burdens to EOL care for family. Conclusion: Due to the lack of experience in hospice care in Iran, patients, families and health care provider not have adequate knowledge about hospice. The cost of this service is high, and qualities of these services are low. Furthermore provide educational courses for patients, families and health care provider and decrease of cost and improve of quality are necessary...|$|R
40|$|An {{estimated}} 5. 7 {{million people}} in the United States are currently living with heart failure (HF); this population is expected to double in the next 25 years due to advances in modern medicine that have decreased the mortality rates for cardiovascular diseases. Because of the complex regimen required, the help of family members, friends or neighbors is crucial to adequately managing symptoms and preventing hospital readmissions. Descriptive phenomenology underpins this study. Formal interviews were used to explore African American caregivers’ lived experience in caring for African American heart failure patients.

40|$|Introduction: In view of {{the recent}} surge in chronic disease rates and elderly {{population}} in the developing countries, there is an urgent felt need for palliative and hospice care services. The present study investigates the views and attitudes of patients and their families, physicians, nurses, healthcare administrators, and insurers regarding designing and delivering hospice care service in a middle income country. Materials and Methods: In this qualitative study, the required data was collected using semi structured interviews and was analyzed using thematic analysis. Totally 65 participants from hospitals and Tabriz University of Medical Sciences were selected purposively to <b>achieve</b> <b>data</b> <b>saturation.</b> Results: Analyzing the data, five main themes (barriers, facilitators, strategies, attitudes, and service provider) were extracted. Barriers included financial issues, cultural-religious beliefs, patient and family-related obstacles, and barriers related to healthcare system. Facilitators included family-related issues, cultural-religious beliefs, as well as facilitators associated with patients, healthcare status, and benefits of hospice service. Most participants (79 %) had positive attitude towards hospice care service. Participant suggested 10 ways to design and deliver effective and efficient hospice care service. They thought the presence of physicians, nurses, and psychologists and other specialists and clergy were necessary in the hospice care team. Conclusion: Due to lack of experience in hospice care in developing countries, research for identifying probable barriers and appropriate management for reducing unsuccessfulness in designing and delivering hospice care service seems necessary. Input from the facilitators and their suggested solutions {{can be useful in}} planning the policy for hospice care system...|$|R
40|$|Background: Palliative care is multidimensional and {{includes}} physical, psychological, social, and spiritual dimensions. Hospices provide specialist palliative care. Limited {{research has been}} performed in hospice care. Therefore, {{there is a lack}} of insight into this topic. Objective: To gain insight into the current practices of multidimensional care provided by multidisciplinary teams in hospices and to gain insight into current hospice care in the Netherlands. Method: A mixed methods, sequential, explanatory design was performed from January to July. Results: It was concluded that nurses often report on all four dimensions. The multidisciplinary consults scored high on all dimensions and the spiritual dimension requires more attention from all disciplines. Participants in focus groups said that more attention was paid to multidimensionality than that which was found in patient records; however, this attention was not always reported. Interdisciplinary teams are desirable when all disciplines are responsible for attending to each of the dimensions. Conclusions: Multidimensional care is not always reflected in patient records. The spiritual dimension is lacking, because it is considered a privacy issue. Structure is necessary to provide care according the steps of clinical reasoning, and to give attention to all dimensions. This structure must fit into hospice care and the organisation to be supportive. Most hospices employ multidisciplinary teams; however, interdisciplinary consults are lacking. Education is required to gain the competencies necessary to give palliative care. Recommendations: To <b>achieve</b> <b>data</b> <b>saturation,</b> more research is needed. There is much gained when hospice facilities start working together with all disciplines present during MDC. Also, more structured is needed in reporting methods. Care providers that use structured methods can teach this to others. Furthermore, attention must be given to the education levels of these professionals to provide a high standard of care and develop competencies in clinical reasoning and spiritual care...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Diagest 3 {{was a study}} {{aimed at}} {{lowering}} {{the risk of developing}} type 2 diabetes within 3 [*]years after childbirth. Women with gestational diabetes were enrolled in the study. After childbirth, the subjects showed little interest in the structured education programme and did not attend workshops. Their general practitioners (GPs) were approached to help motivate the subjects to participate in Diagest 3, but the GPs were reluctant. The present study aimed to understand field GPs’ attitudes towards hospital-based studies, and to develop strategies to enhance their involvement and reduce subject drop-out rates. Methods We used a three-step process: step one used a phenomenological approach exploring the beliefs, attitudes, motivations and environmental factors contributing to the GPs’ level of interest in the study. Data were collected in face-to-face interviews and coded by hand and with hermeneutic software to develop distinct GP profiles. Step two was a cross-sectional survey by questionnaire to determine the distribution of the profiles in the GP study population and whether completion of an attached case report form (CRF) was associated with a particular GP profile. In step three, we assessed the impact of the motivation study on participation rates in the main study. Results Fifteen interviews were conducted to <b>achieve</b> <b>data</b> <b>saturation.</b> Theorisation led to the definition of 4 distinct GP profiles. The response rate to the questionnaire was 73 %, but dropped to 52 % when a CRF was attached. The link between GP profiles and the rate of CRF completion remains to be verified. The GPs provided data on the CRF that was of comparable quality to those collected in the main trial. Our analysis showed that the motivation study increased overall participation in the main study by 23 %, accounting for 16 % (24 / 152) of all final visits for 536 patients who were initially enrolled in the Diagest 3 study. Conclusions When a hospital-led study explores issues in primary care, its design must anticipate GP participation early in the trial. Based on our questionnaire response rates, we found that one in two GPs were willing to participate in our hospital-led study, regardless of their initial attitudes. </p...|$|R
