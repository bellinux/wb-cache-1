25|$|For astronomical imaging, the {{atmosphere}} prevents optimal resolution from being {{achieved in the}} visible spectrum due to the atmospheric scattering and dispersion which cause stars to twinkle. Astronomers refer to this effect as the quality of astronomical seeing. Techniques known as adaptive optics {{have been used to}} eliminate the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>disruption</b> of images and achieve results that approach the diffraction limit.|$|E
40|$|The Kaali crater field (1 sq. kilometre, 9 craters) {{offers a}} unique {{opportunity}} to recover large amounts of magnetic fines still partly preserved from late-stage weathering. SEM studies of these materials reveal an unusually wide spectrum of derivatives from the initial iron meteorite body, including minor amounts of unmelted metal fragments, and an abun-dance of more evolved products resulting from primary oxidation processes. Most of these products are sprays and splashes of liquid iron oxides, and some particles may be ascribed to oxide condensates from a vapor phase, as a result of both atmospheric ablation and vaporization upon impact. This wide range reflects varied impact conditions, due to variable masses and velocities of fragments after <b>atmospheric</b> <b>disruption</b> of the original meteoritic body. The large spectrum of magnetic fines from Kaali should provide an excellent probe into the chemical- and isotopic-fractionation of elements over a range of impact processes, from atmospheric entry to post-impact alteration. Magnetic fines from other sites of multiple impacts may have the same potential, and deserve more systematic attention...|$|E
40|$|Droughts {{are often}} characterised as {{meteorological}} events: periodic precipitation deficits associated with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>disruption.</b> However, the droughts that concern our societies are typically socioeconomic events: {{instances in which}} water demand approaches or exceeds a supply diminished due to low precipitation. This article analyses a 2015 - 16 drought in Panama, typically among the world’s rainiest countries, to argue that some droughts might be usefully conceptualised as infrastructural events. This analytic complements research on climatic and socioeconomic dynamics by opening up lines of inquiry that might reframe drought events. When, for example, does a drought begin and end? Where do droughts come from? Who and what are (in) visible in drought explanations and responses? The article is organised around three key dimensions of the infrastructural event, each responding {{to one of the}} questions above. The first, momentum, makes the case for a deeper temporal understanding of drought that attends to the inertia of water-intensive sociotechnical systems. The second, interconnection, examines how linkages between these systems and regional-to-global infrastructure networks can amplify situated water demands. The third, visibility, explores the mechanisms through which infrastructure frames understandings of and responses to drought, including the normalisation of water distribution politics...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} impact of inventory pre-positioning on humanitarian operations. The study identifies optimal locations for warehousing non-consumable inventories required for initial deployment of aid. These facility location problems are geometric optimizations using mean annual homeless resulting from hazards (<b>atmospheric</b> <b>disruptions,</b> floods, waves, landslides, seismic disruptions, volcanoes and wildfires) as an indirect estimation of demand for infrastructure inventory. Minimization of per capita distance, or the average global distance from the nearest warehouse to a forecasted homeless person, is advanced as the objective. An array of formulations, solved using mixed-integer linear programs, predict optimal facility configurations, and corresponding per capita distances, under incremental facility constraints; thereby measuring sensitivity of mean distance to facility proliferation. The problems are devised to also gather insights into maximal covering {{and the effects of}} initial conditions. (cont.) Moreover, demand patterns, along with correlated variables such as population and hazard frequency, offer views of regional vulnerability to natural disasters. The results also exhibit the absence of re-configuration, indicating that location decisions may not be impacted by the number of facilities planned. by Anup Roop Akkihal. Thesis (M.

40|$|Supervolcanoes {{are large}} caldera systems that can expel vast {{quantities}} of ash, volcanic gases in a single eruption, far larger than any recorded in recent history. These super-eruptions have been suggested as possible catalysts for long-term climate change and {{may be responsible for}} bottlenecks in human and animal populations. Here, we consider the previously neglected climatic effects of a continent-sized ash deposit with a high albedo and show that a decadal climate forcing is expected. We use a coupled atmosphere-ocean General Circulation Model (GCM) to simulate the effect of an ash blanket from Yellowstone volcano, USA, covering much of North America. Reflectivity measurements of dry volcanic ash show albedo values as high as snow, implying that the effects of an ash blanket would be severe. The modeling results indicate major disturbances to the climate, particularly to oscillatory patterns such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>disruptions</b> would continue for decades after the eruption due to extended ash blanket longevity. The climatic response to an ash blanket is not significant enough to instigate a change to stadial periods at present day boundary conditions, though this is one of several impacts associated with a super-eruption which may induce long-term climatic change. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade interplanetary {{telecommunication}} capabilities have been significantly expanded [...] specifically {{in support of the}} Mars exploration rover and lander missions. NASA is continuing to drive advances in new, high payoff optical communications technologies to enhance the network to Gbps performance from Mars, and the transition from technology demonstration to operational system is examined through a hybrid RF/optical approach. Such a system combines the best features of RF and optical communications considering availability and performance to realize a dual band trunk line operating within characteristic constraints. Disconnection due to planetary obscuration and solar conjunction, link delays, timing, ground terminal mission congestion and scheduling policy along with space and <b>atmospheric</b> weather <b>disruptions</b> all imply the need for network protocol solutions to ultimately manage the physical layer in a transparent manner to the end user. Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) is an approach under evaluation which addresses these challenges. A multi-hop multi-path hybrid RF and optical test bed has been constructed to emulate the integrated deep space network and to support protocol and hardware refinement. Initial experimental results characterize several of these challenges and evaluate the effectiveness of DTN as a solution to mitigate them...|$|R
40|$|Studying the {{aerodynamic}} {{interactions between}} bodies travelling at highly supersonic speeds {{is necessary to}} our understanding of the separation of meteoroid fragments following <b>atmospheric</b> <b>disruption.</b> Here we show that a phenomenon referred to as "shock-wave surfing", in which a body moves in such a way as to follow the shock wave generated by another upstream body, can lead to the accumulation of a significantly higher relative lateral velocity between fragments than would otherwise be possible. The surfing phenomenon is investigated for the canonical cases of interactions between a sphere and a wedge, and between two spheres. Numerical simulations are performed and a simple theoretical model is developed to determine the forces acting on the surfing body. A phase-plane description is employed to elucidate features of the system dynamics in both cases. For the two sphere case, a strong influence of the body radius ratio on the separation process is found and a critical ratio is predicted for initially touching fragments that delineates entrainment of the smaller fragment within the larger fragment's shock from expulsion. It is also shown that a large fraction of the variation in the separation behaviour of meteoroid fragments deduced by previous authors from an analysis of terrestrial crater fields can be explained by a combination of surfing and a modest rotation rate of the parent body. ...|$|E
