5000|$|It also {{included}} Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) with Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Hydraulic Brake Assist (HBA), <b>Anti-Slip</b> <b>Regulation</b> (ASR) - {{which is currently}} standard equipment on most variants throughout Europe and optional on others. Protection against whiplash injury in the rear impact (whiplash) test was also good.|$|E
50|$|Standard {{features}} included six airbags, isofix attachments, {{automatic door}} locks, fire prevention system (fuel cut off), ABS braking with brake force distribution, an <b>anti-slip</b> <b>regulation</b> system to limit wheel slip {{in cases of}} reduced grip, traction control, electronic stability control, hill-holder, electric speed-sensitive power steering system, 40-20-40 split rear seating, and a headlight delay system marketed as Follow Me Home.|$|E
50|$|Caravelle: This {{includes}} {{most of the}} Kombi and Shuttle features already standard, plus ESP, Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), <b>Anti-Slip</b> <b>Regulation</b> (ASR - {{more commonly}} known as traction control system), passenger's seat with adjustable lumbar support, air conditioning, electrically adjustable and heated mirrors, and armrests for front-seat passenger and driver. Optional features include Automatic Tailgate Power Closing system, and multi-disc CD changer. The Caravelle is only available in SWB or LWB, with a maximum of ten seats.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{vehicles}} {{are equipped with}} front and side driver and passenger airbags as well as seat belt pre-tensioners. [...] Driving stability is provided by Maserati Stability Program (MSP) which became standard on the 2004 models and controls the engine and brakes to help the driver control the vehicle in extreme driving situations. [...] The MSP system integrates four different vehicle systems - the <b>anti-slip</b> <b>regulation</b> traction control (ASR), the motor spin regulation (MSR), electronic brake force distribution (EBD), and anti-lock braking system (ABS). [...] The wheels employ a high-performance Brembo braking system with light alloy four-piston calipers and cross-drilled large ventilating discs.|$|E
50|$|B6 S4 brakes {{consisted}} of radially ventilated disc brakes front and rear. The front discs are sized at 345 mm in diameter by 30 mm thick, and are clamped by Continental Teves-ATE FNRG-60 single-piston sliding brake calipers. The rears are 300 mm by 22 mm, and again use single-piston sliding calipers, with an integrated cable-operated hand brake mechanism. A Bosch ESP 5.7 Electronic Stability Programme system, complete with Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), Emergency Brake Assist (EBA), Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) and <b>Anti-Slip</b> <b>Regulation</b> (ASR) - {{also known as}} traction control system, coupled with a dual-rate tandem vacuum servo provided the brake actuation.|$|E
5000|$|The MC12's chassis is a {{monocoque}} made {{of carbon}} and nomex, with an aluminium sub-chassis {{at the front}} and rear. It has a roll bar to provide additional strength, comfort and safety. Double wishbone suspension with push-rod-operated coil springs provide stability and dampers smooth the ride for the passengers. The {{front of the car}} can be raised for speed bumps and hills by pressing a button that extends the front suspension. There are two modes for the chassis' tuning which can also be changed with a button in the cabin: [...] "sport", the standard setting, and [...] "race", which features less of the [...] "Bosch ASR" [...] (<b>anti-slip</b> <b>regulation)</b> traction control, faster shifts and stiffer suspension.|$|E
50|$|The 550 used a front-engine, {{rear-wheel drive}} {{transaxle}} layout, with the 6-speed gearbox {{located at the}} rear axle together with the limited slip differential.The chassis tubular steel space frame, to which the aluminium body panels were soldered. The Pininfarina-designed body had a drag coefficient of 0.33. Suspension was of the double wishbone type with coaxial coil spring and damper units on all four corners, and anti-roll bars front and rear. The steering was rack and pinion with variable power assist. The vented disc brakes were 330 mm at the front and 310 mm at the rear. Magnesium alloy {{was used for the}} 18-inch wheels.Electronic driver aid systems included <b>anti-slip</b> <b>regulation,</b> which could be adjusted on two levels or switched off completely, and four-way anti-lock braking system.|$|E
50|$|The body of {{the fifth}} {{generation}} uses extensive high strength steel, and use of laser welding is up from 5% to 35% of body parts. This results in double-digit increases in both dynamic and torsional rigidity. Other body innovations include an impact-absorbing front bumper which yields slightly {{in the event of}} a collision with a pedestrian, reducing the chance of injury. A new door design allows just the outer panel to be removed and replaced if damaged, rather than the entire door. Safety was again enhanced with many active and passive features available or standard. These included side curtain airbags, seat-mounted rear side airbags, new generation Electronic Stability Programme with <b>Anti-Slip</b> <b>Regulation</b> and Brake assist, as well as active head restraints. A Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) transmission, available dual-zone automatic climate control, and electro-mechanical power steering are also new innovations.|$|E
5000|$|It is a {{rear wheel}} drive {{electric}} car version of R8 Coupé. It includes two permanent magnet synchronous motors at the rear axle rated [...] and 820 Nm (total), torque vectoring, electric single-wheel <b>anti-slip</b> <b>regulation,</b> Multimaterial Space Frame chassis with increased use of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer over R8 GT, springs made from Fibre-reinforced plastic, wheel hubs made of forged titanium, anti-roll bar boasts made in hybrid aluminum and carbon fiber, 19-inch wheels with friction-optimized 225-35 series tires, 48.6 kWh lithium-ion battery beneath the passenger cabin as structural element, Crescendo Red Metallic body colour, fine chrome horizontal struts on the grille, e-tron-specific LED headlamp design, diffuser at the rear, 7-inch Multi Media Interface display, 6.7-inch AMOLED (Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode) optic rear-view mirror system, leather and Alcantara upholstery, e-sound artificial engine noise emitting from a speaker system mounted in the underbody that is audible outside the car at speeds under 60 kph mph.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the construction of}} an ASR system that is to control the slip of driving wheels of a vehicle by making use of the construction, function and operation of the pneumatic braking system and the pneumatic suspension control equipment. The essence of the solution presented is the use of the piston-spring part of the spring brake chamber as an actuator in the <b>anti-slip</b> <b>regulation</b> system. In the modernised version of the prototype, the system is controlled by means of a pneumatic solenoid valve, which performs the functions of an ASR modulator. The above concept may be implemented in trucks, buses, or other vehicles provided with pneumatic braking systems. The prototype ASR system proposed was verified by computer simulation tests.

40|$|Abstract. SystemC {{is widely}} used in hardware/software codesign. Al-though it is also used {{for the design of}} safety-critical applications, {{existing}} formal verification techniques for SystemC are still hardly used in indus-trial practice. The main reasons for this are scalability issues, the lacking support for many practically relevant SystemC language constructs, and that counter-examples are not always easy to use for debugging. In this paper, we present an approach for the formal verification of SystemC designs using the BLAST model checker. The main advantages of our approach are: First, we enable a fully automatic verification of SystemC designs that makes use of counter-example guided abstraction refine-ment. Second, we support a large subset of SystemC, including pointers, arrays, and structs. Third, we ease debugging by keeping the structure of the design transparent to the designer. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach with experimental results from an <b>Anti-Slip</b> <b>Regulation</b> and Anti-Lock Braking system...|$|E
