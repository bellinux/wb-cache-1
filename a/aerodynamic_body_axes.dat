40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the power laws for the perception of rotation about the three major <b>body</b> <b>axes.</b> Eighteen airline pilots made magnitude estimates of 5 -sec pulses of nine angular accelerations having a range of acceleration x time of 10 - 150 deg/sec. The results showed that (1) the power law with an exponent of 1. 4 describes the subjective motion of these pilots for all three major <b>body</b> <b>axes,</b> (2) the power law also describes the perception of motion for individual pilots with a substantial range of exponents, (3) there were significant correlations among the exponents for the three <b>body</b> <b>axes,</b> and (4) the data suggest that the power law over the wide range used may be more complex than implied by a formula with a single exponent...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} method, {{boundary}} layer thickening {{is combined with}} laminar flow control to reduce drag. An <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>body</b> is accelerated enabling a ram turbine on the body to receive air at velocity V sub 0. The discharge air is directed over an aft portion of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>body</b> producing boundary layer thickening. The ram turbine also drives a compressor by applying torque to a shaft connected between the ram turbine and the compressor. The compressor sucks in lower boundary layer air through inlets in the shell of the aircraft producing laminar flow control and reducing drag. The discharge from the compressor is expanded in a nozzle to produce thrust...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} simple {{nonlinear}} observer for estimating the attitude and velocity of a rigid {{body from the}} measurements of specific acceleration, angular velocity, magnetic field (in <b>body</b> <b>axes),</b> and linear velocity (in <b>body</b> <b>axes).</b> It is uniformly globally exponentially convergent, and also enjoys other nice properties: global decoupling of pitch and roll estimation from magnetic measurements, good local behavior, and easy tuning. The observer is "geometry-free", {{in the sense that}} it respects only asymptotically the rotational geometry. The good behavior of the observer, even when the measurements are noisy and biased is illustrated in simulation...|$|R

50|$|The work on {{the second}} {{prototype}}'s <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>body</b> started. The second prototype was based on patents using streamlining principles of Paul Jaray. It was {{very similar to the}} first prototype, but this time it was equipped with an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>body.</b> The lower part was following the lines of an aeroplane wing, while the upper part was supposed to be like a second wing added on top. The rear mudguards were incorporated into the body and the rear wheels were covered. The remnants of front mudguards became part of the front bonnet. The running boards were abandoned and accessories (i.e. door handles) were recessed into the body. The floor was flat and enclosed. The front window was inclined at a 45° angle.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe left–right body axis is coordinately {{aligned with}} the {{orthogonal}} dorsoventral and anterioposterior <b>body</b> <b>axes.</b> The developmental mechanisms that regulate axis coordination are unknown. Here it is shown that the cardiac left–right orientation in zebrafish (Danio rerio) is randomized in notochord-defectiveno tailandfloating headmutants. no tail(Brachyury) andfloating head(Xnot) encode putative transcription factors that are expressed in the organizer and notochord, structures which regulate dorsoventral and anterioposterior development in vertebrate embryos. Results from dorsal tissue extirpation and cardiac primordia explantation indicate that cardiac left–right orientation is dependent on dorsoanterior structures including the notochord and is specified during neural fold stages inXenopus laevis. Thus, the notochord coordinates the development of all three <b>body</b> <b>axes</b> in the vertebrate body plan...|$|R
