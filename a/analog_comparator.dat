The error-detection circuit monitors the input and some observable internal nodes of the examined circuit and generates {{an estimate of}} its output.

40|$|Problem statement: With {{the advent}} of the {{advanced}} technology and the need for more advanced equipment, the current progress and development of electronic instruments stimulate more interest and efforts for more innovative ideas and better designs. Many real world physical values, such as sounds, temperature, pressure and humidity, can be measured as analog or continuous signals. However, to process these signals by computers or digital equipments, we need first to convert these analog signals into digital or discreet signals. Approach: There are many types of Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) which can be classified according to the concept on which they were designed. For example, there are charge-coupled A/D converter, digital-ramp A/D converter, successive approximation A/D converter, voltage-to-frequency A/D converter, Delta-Sigma A/D converter, Flash A/D converter and some of these converters require the use of Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) and/or <b>analog</b> <b>comparators</b> and some logic modules. In some other cases, many <b>analog</b> <b>comparators</b> are needed to perform the conversion. We are trying to use a different approach that reduce the design complexity and improve the measurement quality by using the double-slope integration concept. Result: The new design does not require the use of a DAC module, nor does it need to use many <b>analog</b> <b>comparators</b> to do the conversion. Conclusion: The advantage of the new design would contribute to the simplicity of the design, enhance its reliability and guarantee the linearity of the conversion process that leads into better quality instruments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{following}} discussion examines an overlooked option for many existing A/D converter applications: the A/D conversion is sometimes better implemented with a discrete comparator and D/A converter. This substitution generally entails a different measurement approach, but the advantages can include lower cost, higher speed, more flexibility, and lower power consumption. Current trends, though, {{are in the}} other direction—designers who must implement A/D conversion usually specify a packaged A/D converter (ADC) for the job. Most engineers {{are not aware of}} an alternative, and the price/performance ratios for ADCs are falling all the time. Yet, an <b>analog</b> <b>comparator</b> plus D/A converter (DAC), along with digital processing capability, form the core of a successive-approximation ADC. The discrete comparator/DAC approach is already common in certain fields. Automatic test equipment, nuclear pulse-height discriminators, and automated time-domain reflectometers often use the technique whereby one comparator input is driven by the DAC, and the other is driven by the signal to be monitored. Following is a selection of general measurement problems and specific applications in which a comparator/DAC combination is actually more appropriate than an off-the-shelf ADC.

40|$|Existing {{sensor network}} {{architectures}} {{are based on}} the assumption that data will be polled. Therefore, they are not adequate for long-term battery-powered use in applications that must sense or react to events that occur at unpredictable times. In response, and motivated by a structural autonomous crack monitoring (ACM) application from civil engineering that requires bursts of high resolution sampling in response to aperiodic vibrations in buildings and bridges, we have designed, implemented, and evaluated lucid dreaming, a hardware/software technique to dramatically decrease sensor node power consumption in this and other related event-driven sensing applications. Our hardware is an add-on board for standard Crossbow Motes that makes use of an ultralow-power <b>analog</b> <b>comparator</b> and an in-system programmable precision voltage reference. The sensor, e. g., geophone, output voltage is compared to the reference. When it exceeds the reference, an interrupt is delivered to the Mote, activating it and triggering high-resolution sampling. In the structural integrity monitoring application, this is achieved with 1 / 245 the average power consumption required by existing sensor network architectures, thereby dramatically increasing battery lifespan. We believe that the proposed technique will yield similar benefits in a wide range of applications...|$|E
40|$|Efficient spike {{acquisition}} {{techniques are}} needed to bridge the divide from creating large multielectrode arrays (MEA) to achieving whole-cortex electrophysiology. In this paper, we introduce generalized analog thresholding (gAT), which achieves millisecond temporal resolution with sampling rates as low as 10 Hz. Consider the torrent of data from a single 1, 000 -channel MEA, which would generate more than 3 GB/min using standard 30 -kHz Nyquist sampling. Recent neural signal processing methods based on compressive sensing still require Nyquist sampling {{as a first step}} and use iterative methods to reconstruct spikes. Analog thresholding (AT) remains the best existing alternative, where spike waveforms are passed through an <b>analog</b> <b>comparator</b> and sampled at 1 kHz, with instant spike reconstruction. By generalizing AT, the new method reduces sampling rates another order of magnitude, detects more than one spike per interval, and reconstructs spike width. Unlike compressive sensing, the new method reveals a simple closed-form solution to achieve instant (noniterative) spike reconstruction. The base method is already robust to hardware nonidealities, including realistic quantization error and integration noise. Because it achieves these considerable specifications using hardware-friendly components like integrators and comparators, generalized AT could translate large-scale MEAs into implantable devices for scientific investigation and medical technology...|$|E
