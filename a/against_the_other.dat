Colwell recommended that the formal dereliction of duty charges be dropped <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> AWACS crew members, but that they could still face nonjudicial action. Croker accepted Colwell's recommendation and ordered Wang to face court-martial and dismissed the criminal charges <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> AWACS crew members except Halcli, who was offered Article 15 action.|$|E
5|$|On Newfoundland, English colonists {{based at}} St. John's disputed {{control of the}} island with the French based at Plaisance.

5|$|A merchant, José Ignacio Rezábal, {{attended}} the open cabildo but, {{in a letter}} to the priest Julián S. de Agüero, said that he had some doubts which were shared by other people close to him.

He felt that the open cabildo would lack legitimacy if too many criollos were allowed to take part in it as a result of the aforementioned manipulation of the guest list.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his growing}} {{national}} fame, Dow continued to face opposition at home. Both Dow and his opponents engaged in anonymous newspaper campaigns <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> often making personal attacks alongside political arguments. For the 1852 municipal election, the Democrats nominated Albion Parris, {{a former governor}} and United States Senator, to run against Dow. While the Democrats rallied behind their candidate, Dow's vigorous enforcement of prohibition divided his party, and in two wards the Whigs ran an anti-Dow ticket instead. On election day, Dow slightly increased his vote total from the year before, with 1496, but Parris outpolled him, bringing in 1900 votes. Although the Whigs controlled voter registration at the time, Dow blamed his loss on illegal voting by Irish immigrants.|$|E

When the plot was uncovered, the eunuchs arrested Empress Dowager Dou (d.172AD) and Chen Fan. General Zhang Huan (張奐) favored the eunuchs. He and his troops confronted Dou Wu and his retainers {{at the palace}} gate where each side shouted accusations of treason <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> When the retainers gradually deserted Dou Wu, {{he was forced to}} commit suicide.|$|E

5|$|In February 2007, Wotton {{was granted}} a {{separate}} trial from his co-accused in the Brisbane District Court since the allegations in the prosecution case <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> co-accused were prejudicial to Wotton's case.

In late March, after Wotton had already applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the advice of his legal representatives (including his then barrister Marcus Einfeld), Wotton's co-accused were acquitted by a jury of rioting causing destruction. Wotton's application to withdraw his plea was granted by Nase DCJ on 26 April 2007. A few days later, Wotton was released on bail with strict conditions and ordered to return in April 2008 to be tried.|$|E

5|$|In the quarter-final Hibs {{were drawn}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> senior club from Ayrshire, away to Ayr United.

Hibs scored two early goals and progressed to the semi-final with a 2–0 victory. In the semi-final, Hibs took on Aberdeen at Hampden Park.

50|$|For some of {{the most}} {{interesting}} games such as ombre, tarot and skat, the associations between players change from hand to hand. Ultimately players all play on their own, but for each hand, some game mechanism divides the players into two teams. Most typically these are solo games, i.e. games in which one player becomes the soloist and has to achieve some objective <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> who form a team and win or lose all their points jointly. But in games for more than three players, there may also be a mechanism that selects two players who then have to play <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|R

While 70 delegates from 26 nations participated in the Paris negotiations, representatives from Germany were barred from attending, nominally over fears that a German delegation would attempt to play one country off <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> and unfairly influence the proceedings.|$|E

5|$|Scotland and England are {{the oldest}} {{national}} football {{teams in the}} world. Teams representing the two sides first competed at the Oval in five matches between 1870 and 1872. The two countries contested the first official international football match, at Hamilton Crescent in Partick, Scotland, on 30 November 1872. The match ended in a goalless draw. All eleven players who represented Scotland that day played for Glasgow amateur club Queen's Park. Over the next forty years, Scotland played matches exclusively <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> three Home Nations—England, Wales and Ireland. The British Home Championship began in 1883, making these games competitive. The encounters against England were particularly fierce and a rivalry quickly developed.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E
