40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{stability}} of eight fresh cadaver knees was measured {{before and after}} insertion of a geometric or <b>anametric</b> prosthetic replacement and then after serial section of first the anterior and then the posterior cruciate ligament. Force-displacement curves were obtained for anterior-posterior force ver-sus displacement, tibial torque versus rotation, and varus-valgus moment versus rotation with knees in full extension and in 20 degrees of flexion using a previ-ously described technique. The curves were then com-pared to evaluate the stiffness and laxity of the knees after each procedure. During varus-valgus testing the responses seen in the intact knees in both extension and flexion were rea-sonably well preserved after insertion of both pros...|$|E
