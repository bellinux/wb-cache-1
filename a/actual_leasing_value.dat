The {{purpose of this paper is}} to estimate office space demand and show patterns of office space usage in a suburban county. Specifically, we estimate the share of employees in freestanding offices, by empirically observing the share of industry employment in offices in 1986. We then assess the accuracy of our values and compare our results with an alternative, occupational approach. The data is drawn from Prince George's County, Maryland, a suburban county of Washington, D. C. To briefly summarize findings, our empirically based, industry-specific approach indicates there is a changing and wide variation in the share of employment in freestanding office buildings across the two-digit service industries.
