50|$|Collinear {{arrays of}} dipoles are high gain {{omnidirectional}} antennas.

They radiate vertically polarized radio waves. Theoretically, when stacking idealised lossless dipole antennas in such a fashion, doubling their number will produce double the gain, with an increase of 3.01 dB. In practice, the gain realized will be below this due to imperfect radiation spread and losses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{radiation}} pattern of a straight random wire antenna is unpredictable and {{depends on its}} electrical length; its length measured in wavelengths (λ) of the radio waves used.

Above this the lobe will split into two conical lobes with their maximum directed at equal angles to the wire, and a null between them. This results in four azimuth angles at which the gain is maximum. As the length of wire in wavelengths increases, the number of lobes increases and the maxima become increasingly sharp. A folded or zig-zag antenna will exhibit a pattern that is even more complicated and difficult to predict.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} antennas, monopole and dipole antennas, {{consist of}} one or two straight metal rods along a common axis.

So the gain of any antenna is proportional to its aperture:So antennas with large effective apertures are high gain antennas, which have small angular beam widths. Most of their power is radiated in a narrow beam in one direction, and little in other directions. As receiving antennas, they are most sensitive to radio waves coming from one direction, and are much less sensitive to waves coming from other directions. Although these terms {{can be used as}} a function of direction, when no direction is specified, the gain and aperture are understood to refer to the <b>antenna's</b> <b>axis</b> of maximum gain, or boresight.|$|R

The pattern departs from omnidirectional by only ±5 percent. [...] The radiation in these horizontal directions is often increased by vertically stacking multiple turnstile antennas (called [...] "bays") fed in phase. This increases the gain by strengthening the radiation in the desired horizontal directions but causes partial cancellation of the radiation in vertical directions, reducing power wasted radiated into the sky or down toward the earth. These stacked normal mode turnstile antennas are used at VHF and UHF frequencies for FM and television broadcasting.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{circumference}} of the helix is significantly less than a wavelength and its pitch (axial distance between successive turns) is significantly {{less than a quarter}} wavelength, the antenna is called a normal-mode helix. The antenna acts similar to a monopole antenna, with an omnidirectional radiation pattern, radiating equal power in all directions perpendicular to the <b>antenna's</b> <b>axis.</b> However, because of the inductance added by the helical shape, the antenna acts like a inductively loaded monopole; at its resonant frequency it is shorter than a quarter-wavelength long. Therefore, normal-mode helices can be used as electrically short monopoles, an alternative to center- or base-loaded whip antennas, in applications where a full sized quarter-wave monopole would be too big. As with other electrically short antennas, the gain, and thus the communication range, of the helix will be less than that of a full sized antenna.

The individual wavefronts are spherical, but they combine (superpose) {{in front of the}} antenna to create a plane wave, a beam of radio waves travelling in a specific direction.

5000|$|In radio communication, an {{omnidirectional}} antenna is {{a class of}} antenna which radiates radio wave power uniformly in all directions in one plane, with the radiated power decreasing with elevation angle above or below the plane, dropping to zero on the <b>antenna's</b> <b>axis.</b> This radiation pattern {{is often described as}} [...] "doughnut shaped". Note that this is different from an isotropic antenna, which radiates equal power in all directions and has a [...] "spherical" [...] radiation pattern. Omnidirectional antennas oriented vertically are widely used for nondirectional antennas {{on the surface of the}} Earth because they radiate equally in all horizontal directions, while the power radiated drops off with elevation angle so little radio energy is aimed into the sky or down toward the earth and wasted. Omnidirectional antennas are widely used for radio broadcasting antennas, and in mobile devices that use radio such as cell phones, FM radios, walkie-talkies, wireless computer networks, cordless phones, GPS as well as for base stations that communicate with mobile radios, such as police and taxi dispatchers and aircraft communications.|$|R
5000|$|Off {{the ends}} of the <b>antenna's</b> <b>axis,</b> {{perpendicular}} to the plane of the elements, the antenna radiates circularly-polarized (CP) radio waves. This is called axial mode. The radiation off one end is righthand-circularly-polarized and the other end is lefthand-circularly-polarized. Which end produces which polarization is determined by the phase of the feed connections. Since in a directional antenna only a single beam is wanted, in a simple axial-mode antenna a flat conducting surface such as a metal screen reflector is added, a quarter-wavelength under the crossed elements. [...] The waves in that direction are reflected back 180° and the reflection reverses the polarization sense, so the reflected waves reinforce the forward radiation. [...] For example, if the radio waves radiated forward are right-circularly-polarized, the waves radiated backwards will be left-circularly-polarized. The flat reflector reverses the polarization sense so the reflected waves are right-circularly-polarized. By locating the reflector λ/4 behind the elements the direct and reflected waves are in phase and add. Addition of the reflector increases the axial radiation by a factor of 2 (3 dB).|$|R
