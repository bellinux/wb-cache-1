60|$|The {{position}} of Acre, the ancient Ptolemais, was indeed very favourable for its protection by a fleet. It {{stood on a}} projecting promontory almost square in shape; three sides were entirely washed by the sea; the north-eastern side had no natural protection, but at an angle of the wall a tower, which was the strongest point of the defences, covered it to some extent. Near the tower, and with its garden <b>abutting</b> <b>against</b> the wall, stood the pasha's palace. The masonry of {{the greater part of}} the wall was old and crumbling. From the sea {{to the north of the}} town vessels anchored there could cover the approaches to the northern side by their fire, while these could similarly be swept by ships anchored in the Bay of Acre on the south side of the fortress.|$|E
6000|$|In the act {{of working}} the apparatus, one man was placed {{at each of the}} guy-tackles. This man {{assisted}} also at the purchase-tackles for raising the stones; and one of the ablest and most active of the crew was appointed to hold {{on the end of the}} fall-tackle, which often required all his strength and his utmost agility in letting go, for the purpose of lowering the stone at the instant the word [...] "lower" [...] was given. In a rolling sea, much depended on the promptitude with which this part of the operation was performed. For the purpose of securing this, the man who held the tackle placed himself before the mast in a sitting, more frequently in a lying posture, with his feet stretched under the winch and <b>abutting</b> <b>against</b> the mast, as by this means he was enabled to exert his greatest strength.|$|E
60|$|The valve {{is small}} and steeply inclined, with its free {{posterior}} edge <b>abutting</b> <b>against</b> a semicircular, deeply depending collar. It is moderately transparent, and bears two pairs of short stiff bristles, {{in the same position}} as in the other species. The presence of these four bristles, in contrast with the absence of those on the antennae and collar, indicates that they are of functional importance, namely, as I believe, to prevent too large animals forcing an entrance through the valve. The many glands of diverse shapes attached to the valve and round the collar in the previous species are here absent, with the exception of about a dozen of the two-armed or transversely elongated kind, which are seated near the borders of the valve, and are mounted on very short footstalks. These glands are only the 3/4000 of an inch (.019 mm.) in length; though so small, they act as absorbents. The collar is thick, stiff, and almost semi-circular; it is formed of the same peculiar brownish tissue as in the former species.|$|E

50|$|The “Village des Bories” {{comprises}} several “groups” of “cabanes” {{which are}} distributed across the areas North and South of a lane {{that runs through}} the site. A “group” is {{to be seen as a}} reunion of two or more edifices, either <b>abutting</b> <b>against,</b> or adjoining, one another, or in proximity, usually round a small yard. It would be wrong, however, to think that each group belonged to a single family. A study of the Napoleonic and modern land registers has shown that some groups did belong to two separate owners or that the same person could own one building in a group and another building in another group.|$|E
50|$|The {{basement}} {{contains two}} barrel-vaulted rooms separated by arcades and illuminated by a tiny window. They resemble twin-nave churches found in North Lebanon, {{and they probably}} formed the old monastic church. Adjacent to them are six barrel-vaulted cells <b>abutting</b> <b>against</b> the rock of the cliff. Their narrow embrasure-like entrances are cut into a wall up to ninety centimeters in thickness. These cells are arranged in diminishing size from east to west. The communicating doorways also become progressively smaller, so that the visitor must eventually bend down to pass through. Such features suggest a gradual initiation into a monastic life centred upon contemplation and prayer. These cells are comparable to the oldest cells in the monastery of Saydnaya in Syria. The first cell holds the coffin of Makarios Sadaqa, bishop of Beirut {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, whose body is still well preserved.|$|E

5000|$|Bear Creek is {{the best}} known stream {{in this part of}} the field. It is about [...] long and has a fall of nearly [...] to the mile. Bear Creek valley is {{narrower}} than Palmer Creek valley, and while resembling it in some ways, does not have the canyon features so well developed. The country rock is a succession of arkoses inlerstratified with bluish-black slates, the beds being so thin in one or two localities as to give to the outcrops a banded structure. These beds strike N. 20° E., or nearly at right angles to the general course of the creek, the cleavage, however, running more nearly north and south. The gravels are very irregular in distribution and are made up almost entirely of material like the country rock, but include, in addition, a few bowlders of granitic rock. In two places between [...] of unstratified deposits were seen. These contain a large quantity of coarse angular blocks mixed with sands and clays, the whole apparently dumped into its present position without having undergone any sorting by water. Bowlders [...] in diameter are plentiful. In some localities, the surface wash is underlain by stratified sands and clays, which were probably deposited in small local basins, where they are sometimes found <b>abutting</b> <b>against</b> perpendicular rock faces or overlapping sloping surfaces. The hard gray clay locally underlying the surface wash and known as [...] "glacial clay" [...] rests on loose sands composcd largely of slate particles and containing a large amount of water. It has been noticed in a few plates that the rock surface above this clay is worn smooth, while below it is rough and unworn. Bear Creek gold is lower in grade than any other from the Resurrection region. Like that from Palmer Creek, it is usually bright yellow in color, but may be whitish. Some native silver is found, and it is said that a small amount of native copper is also present. One large nugget of gold, valued at about $250, was found. The first claim staked on the stream yielded a little more than $2,000 the first year it was worked, but was not operated with profit in the following years. A second claim worked steadily, but in a small way, sinco the early days of Bear Creek's history has produced an average of $8 a day per man. Two hydraulic plants were installed on Bear Creek.|$|E

40|$|Melanoma is {{a highly}} {{malignant}} neoplasm that commonly arises in skin but primary melanoma can infrequently arise from the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract. Primary gastric mucosal melanoma (PGMM), in particular is a rare clinical phenomenon. 1 To our knowledge, we are documenting the first reported case of PGMM from New Zealand and the eighth in the world. Case report We report a 53 -year-old Caucasian male admitted to Whangarei Hospital with recurrent epigastric pain, weight loss, and recent onset of dysphagia. On clinical examination a hard non-tender epigastric mass was felt. Laboratory investigation confirmed microcytic hypochromic anaemia.

40|$|International audienceIn the Oman ophiolite, {{the large}} scale Makhibiyah shear zone, in Wadi Tayin massif was {{generated}} with no or little relative motion {{between the two}} adjacent blocks, in contrast with what is reported from otherwise similar shear zones in deep crust and upper mantle. This shear zone is asymmetrical with, along one margin an asthenospheric mantle (similar to 1200 degrees C) and along the adjacent margin, a lithospheric mantle (similar to 1000 degrees C). Within the hotter side and with increasing shear strain, horizontal flow lines smoothly swing towards the shear zone direction before <b>abutting</b> <b>against</b> {{the wall of the}} lithosphere side. Profuse mafic melts issued from the hotter mantle are frozen in the shear zone by cooling along this lithospheric wall. Tectonic and magmatic activities are entirely localized within the asthenospheric compartment. Mantle flow lines were rotated, during their channelling along this NW-SE shear zone, in the NW and SE opposite directions. Depending on whether the flow lines are deviated NW or SE, dextral or sinistral shear sense is recorded in the shear band mylonitic peridotites. This demonstrates that the shear zone was not generated by strike-slip motion, a conclusion supported by regional observations...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanisms}} controlling rupture propagation between fault segments {{during a}} large earthquake {{are key to}} the hazard posed by fault systems. Rupture initiation on a smaller fault sometimes transfers to a larger fault, resulting in a significant event (e. g., 2002 M 7. 9 Denali USA and 2010 M 7. 1 Darfield New Zealand earthquakes). In other cases rupture is constrained to the initial fault and does not transfer to nearby faults, resulting in events of more moderate magnitude. This {{was the case of}} the 1989 M 6. 9 Loma Prieta and 2010 M 7. 0 Haiti earthquakes which initiated on reverse faults <b>abutting</b> <b>against</b> a major strike-slip plate boundary fault but did not propagate onto it. Here we investigate the rupture dynamics of the Haiti earthquake, seeking to understand why rupture propagated across two segments of the Léogâne fault but did not propagate to the adjacent Enriquillo Plantain Garden Fault, the major 200 [*]km long plate boundary fault cutting through southern Haiti. We use a finite element model to simulate propagation of rupture on the Léogâne fault, varying friction and background stress to determine the parameter set that best explains the observed earthquake sequence, in particular, the ground displacement. The two slip patches inferred from finite fault inversions are explained by the successive rupture of two fault segments oriented favorably with respect to the rupture propagation, while the geometry of the Enriquillo fault did not allow shear stress to reach failure...|$|E

30|$|The {{procedure}} was {{performed with the}} patient in the supine position. An adductor tenotomy was performed through a medial approach. Mobilization of the damaged hip was performed by undoing the ankylosis through a limited anterolateral approach to the hip and under image intensifier, where {{the remnants of the}} femoral head were removed piecemeal using a bone rongeur. The affected limb was then maximally adducted over the other limb so that {{the upper part of the}} femur was seen parallel to the lateral wall of the pelvis on the affected side and <b>abutting</b> <b>against</b> the ischium; that point of abutment was marked as the site of the proximal osteotomy. With the limb maximally adducted, half pins were inserted in the proximal femur perpendicular to the sagittal plane of the patient’s body and parallel to the horizontal plane. A fixation block consisting of one small and one large arch from the Ilizarov system was attached to these pins. The limb was then abducted back to the neutral position, and a preconstructed Ilizarov frame was then applied to the femur distal to the proposed proximal osteotomy with the pins inserted perpendicular to the axis of the distal femur. The proximal osteotomy was performed percutaneously using a drilling and osteotome method. Holding both the proximal block and the distal part of the frame, the osteotomy was manipulated to affect a derotation–extension–valgus osteotomy but with care to avoid excessive displacement and loss of bone contact. The proximal and distal parts of the frame were connected using threaded rods and oblique supports. The level of the distal osteotomy was determined preoperatively so that the mechanical axis of the lower limb passes through the acetabulum and the knee joint line of the knee remains horizontal. The distal osteotomy was performed percutaneously.|$|E
40|$|A {{transitional}} or cortico-trabecular junctional zone {{exists at}} any location composed of both cortical and trabecular bones {{such as the}} metaphyses of tubular bones and short bones like the femoral neck. The transitional zone comprises the inner cortex adjacent to the medullary canal and trabeculae <b>abutting</b> <b>against</b> the cortex contiguous with the endocortical surface. This is a site of vigorous remodeling. Intracortical remodeling cavitates the inner cortex expanding this transitional zone {{at the price of}} compact-appearing cortex so that it contains porosity, cortical fragments that resemble trabeculae, and trabeculae abutting the eroding cortex. The porosity of the transitional zone is an important source of bone loss. It reduces bone strength exponentially and is a quantifiable `fingerprint 2 ̆ 7 of structural deterioration. A new automated method of segmentation of bone from background and bone into its compact-appearing cortex, transitional zone, and trabecular compartment is described, with a new approach to quantification of cortical porosity. Segmentation is achieved by automatically selecting attenuation profile curves perpendicular to the periosteal surface. Local bone edges are identified as {{the beginning and the end}} of the rising and falling S-shaped portions of the curve enabling the delineation of the compartments. Analyzing 3600 consecutive overlapping profiles around the perimeter of each cross-sectional slice segments the compartments. Porosity is quantified as the average void volume fraction of all voxels within each compartment. To assess accuracy at the distal radius and tibia, μCT images of cadaveric specimens imaged at 19 μm voxel size served as the gold standard. To assess accuracy at the proximal femur, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of specimens collected at 2. 5 μm resolution served as the gold standard. Agreement between HRpQCT and the gold standards for segmentation and quantification of porosity at the distal radius and tibia ranged from R 2 = 0. 87 to 0. 99, and for the proximal femur ranged from 0. 93 to 0. 99. The precision error in vivo for segmentation and quantification of porosity in HRpQCT images at the distal radius, given by the root mean square error of the coefficient of variation, ranged from 0. 54...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to the excavation and restoration work at the pre-Islamic site of Khor Rori itself, the Italian IMTO team opened limited excavations in November 2000 at al-Âamr al-Sharqiya (Inqitat Mirbat), the promontory {{to the east of}} the mouth of the Wadi Darbat (figs. 1, 2) 1. This flat rocky plateau, with a surface area of about 14 ha, and 30 m high, rises nearly sheer from the sea except on its north side where there is a steep but accessible slope. A fortification wall of roughly-worked stones buttressed by small square towers, 2. 70 m thick, and more than 500 m long, was built on the top to protect the settlement from inland (fig. 3). Around the middle of this wall, a single gate flanked by two strong inside bastions gave access to the plateau. The plateau is divided in two by a narrow valley that stretches from the eastern cliff to the western one, and occupation seems to have been limited to three distinct areas in the northern part, between the wall and the slope of the valley. The first contains several large rectangular buildings near the gate. The second has a widespread group of undefined circular structures 4 to 6 m in diameter over about half an hectare west of the gate, halfway towards the western tip of the promontory. The third area has an enclosure of several buildings and is located at the eastern tip of the area, with the high cliffs of the promontory forming the north and east boundaries with the steep slope of the valley to the south (fig. 3). This third area is roughly triangular in shape, 130 m long and 70 m wide at its maximum (circa 0. 5 ha) and is protected west and south by a stone wall 1 m thick, now in a very bad state of conservation, <b>abutting</b> <b>against</b> the fortification wall. The excavations at al-Âamr al-Sharqiya focused on this area and soundings were opened in three buildings; the so-called “house with a patio ” against the western wall of the enclosure, the “palace ” against the south wall, and the “stores ” north of it, near the northern fortification wall of the promontory...|$|E
