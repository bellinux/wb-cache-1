5|$|In 1948, {{she went}} to Oslo, visiting the Van Gogh {{exhibition}} <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> Edvard Munch paintings there. She {{was inspired by a}} display of classical era pots at the Oslo Museum of Craft and Design to create her Amfora ("Amphora") print. The marriage with Leander did not last long, and by 1949 she was travelling Europe with the painter Jaakko ("Jaska") Somersalo, who became her second husband. He taught her the technique of woodcut printing and inspired her to paint. They divorced in 1955.|$|E

5|$|By April, {{resistance}} against the Third Army was tapering off, and the forces' main efforts turned to managing some 400,000 German prisoners of war. On April 14, 1945 Patton {{was promoted to}} general, a promotion long advocated by Stimson in recognition of Patton's battle accomplishments during 1944. Later that month, Patton, Bradley and Eisenhower toured the Merkers salt mine {{as well as the}} Ohrdruf concentration camp, <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> conditions of the camp firsthand caused Patton great disgust. Third Army was ordered toward Bavaria and Czechoslovakia, anticipating a last stand by Nazi German forces there. He was reportedly appalled to learn the Red Army would take Berlin, feeling the Soviet Union was a threat to the U.S. army's advance to Pilsen, but was stopped by Eisenhower from reaching Prague before V-E Day on May 8 {{and the end of the}} war in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{was then}} {{overhauled}} and passed by Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took {{her head out}} of the water, <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> American a body length in front, dug deep to re-establish a lead of 0.7 of a second going into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the lead over the United States to 2.2 seconds to secure gold in a world record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The Melbourne Olympics was the only time that Australia has made a clean sweep of the 100-metre freestyle and the relay events for both men and women. This feat has only been equalled by the Americans at the 1920 Summer Olympics. The victory was Australia's only victory in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Ronny Deila's first {{competitive}} {{match in}} charge of Celtic was a Champions League qualifying tie away against KR Reykjavik on 15 July 2014, which ended in a 1–0 win with midfielder Callum McGregor scoring the decisive goal on 84 minutes. Celtic eased to a 4–0 win in the return match in Scotland, but were comprehensively beaten and outplayed in the next qualifying round, losing 6–1 on aggregate to Legia Warsaw. Despite this, Celtic were given a reprieve when {{it was discovered that}} Legia had fielded an ineligible player in the second leg, Bartosz Bereszynski coming on as a substitute in the last four minutes. UEFA punished the Polish club by awarding the game a 3–0 to Celtic, levelling the aggregate score at 4–4 <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> Scottish champions progress on away goals. Despite this astonishing piece of luck, Celtic failed abjectly to take advantage in the final qualifier against Maribor, losing 2–1 on aggregate to drop down to the Europa League.|$|E

5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E

25|$|An {{opportunity}} for Bevin to ease Beveridge out presented itself in May 1941 when Minister of Health Ernest Brown announced {{the formation of}} a committee of officials to survey existing social insurance and allied services, and to make recommendations. Although Brown had made the announcement, the inquiry had largely been urged by Minister without Portfolio Arthur Greenwood, and Bevin suggested to Greenwood making Beveridge chairman of the committee. Beveridge, at first uninterested <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> committee as a distraction from his work on manpower, accepted only reluctantly.|$|E

25|$|After the {{railways}} in Britain were privatised in 1994, staff from the then operating company, Railtrack, {{paid a visit}} to the Union Pacific Operating Center, USA in 1999. After viewing the facilities <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> control they decided that a handful of major operating centres was the way forward for UK operations. Just one centre was approved and built in 2003 at Saltley, near to Birmingham, as part of the West Coast Route Modernisation. However this building was not connected for some time and whilst it was used by Network Rail staff, no signalling equipment was installed until 2006.|$|E

To Clarence’s great dismay, he saw that Luther Burbank was operating a small seed and nursery business {{in an attempt to}} finance his experiments and provide himself a living.

25|$|The long campaigning and {{hardships that}} Lucullus' troops had endured for years, {{combined}} with a perceived lack of reward {{in the form of}} plunder, led to successive mutinies among the legions in 68–67. Frustrated by the rough terrain of Northern Armenia <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> worsening morale of his troops, Lucullus moved back south and put Nisibis under siege. Tigranes concluded (wrongly) that Nisibis would hold out and sought to regain those parts of Armenia that the Romans had captured. Despite his continuous success in battle, Lucullus could still not capture either one of the monarchs. With Lucullus' troops now refusing to obey his commands, but agreeing to defend positions from attack, the Senate sent Gnaeus Pompey to recall Lucullus to Rome and take over his command.|$|E
25|$|FTL is {{the product}} of the two-man team of Subset Games, Matthew Davis and Justin Ma. Both were {{employees}} of 2K Games's Shanghai studio, and became friends during their tenure there, playing various board games in their free time. Ma, who considered himself a jack-of-all-trades, had become dissatisfied with working in a larger studio, and after traveling to the 2011 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> Independent Games Festival, he realized he wanted to become an independent developer. Davis had left 2K Games early in 2011, and after biking through China, returned and joined Ma, who had also recently quit, and began working on the core FTL game. They agreed they would spend a year towards development and if their efforts did not pan out, they would go on to other things. Following the success of the game, the pair began work on their second game, Into the Breach.|$|E
25|$|NCIS Director Leon Vance (Rocky Carroll) {{agrees to}} a request from Eli and brings the {{involved}} parties to Israel. Eli interrogates Tony and accuses him of killing Rivkin out of jealously, a motivation that Michael Weatherly voiced to have been plausible. Tony, in turn, accuses him of ordering Rivkin to seduce Ziva {{in order to keep}} an eye on her, which he does not deny. Under pressure from her father, Ziva stays in Israel and returns to the Mossad as a full-time operative, taking Rivkin's place on a mission to assassinate Saleem Ulman (Omid Abtahi), the leader of a terrorist training camp in Somalia which also sees her leaving NCIS as well <b>and</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> Major Case Response Team being reduced to three active members: Gibbs, DiNozzo and McGee. Gibbs confronts Vance about the turn of events, insisting that he still trusts Ziva because of her choice to save him by killing her brother four years earlier. In response, Vance claims that she had only done so because her father had ordered to. The final moments of the episode show her to have been taken hostage and tortured by Saleem.|$|E
