In 1931 she told a Sunday Sun reporter that she wanted to see a course of lectures on domestic radio and electricity established in girls' schools and technical colleges. The following year she took matters into her own hands, opening a Women's Radio College on Phillip Street in 1932.

500|$|Craig has {{described}} {{his portrayal of}} Bond as an anti-hero: [...] "The question I keep asking myself while playing the role is, 'Am I the good guy or just a bad guy {{who works for the}} good side?' Bond's role, after all, is that of an assassin when you come down to it. I have never played a role in which someone's dark side shouldn't be explored. I don't think it should be confusing {{by the end of the}} film, but during the film you should be questioning who he is." [...] Craig has stated that his own favourite previous Bond actor is Sean Connery, but says, [...] "I'd never copy somebody else. I would never do an impression of anybody else or try and improve on what they did. That would be a pointless exercise for me." [...] His own favourite Bond film is From Russia with Love. On an episode of The South Bank Show, Connery divulged his thoughts on Craig's casting as Bond, whom he described as [...] "fantastic, marvellous in the part". When told that Craig had taken particular note of his performances, Connery said that he was [...] "flattered" [...] and that Craig really gets the [...] "danger element" [...] to Bond's character. Craig has remarked that Bond is [...] "...actually a misogynist... <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> are drawn to him chiefly because he embodies a certain kind of danger and never sticks around for too long." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{were looking}} for someone who had a [...] "Paris Hilton quality" [...] to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace. She was written to be a bitch in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. The producers thought it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. They {{came up with the idea}} for them to be unrelated stepsiblings, who have a romantic encounter, which became the twist for their backstory. When Boone is killed at the end of season one, it forces Shannon into a more adult existence on the Island. Grace noted Boone is [...] "the only person that ever really knew and loved Shannon, in spite of herself. Of course, losing him, especially with so much left unsaid and unresolved, will change her irrevocably." [...] This freed her up to develop her relationship with Sayid. Naveen Andrews, who plays Sayid, came up with the idea for Shannon and Sayid relationship. He thought, [...] "What would really shock Middle-America? What if Sayid was to have a relationship with a woman that looked like Miss America? The most unlikely pairing… to come completely from left field." [...] This pairing made Shannon [...] "less flighty... more of a person to be reckoned with." [...] According to Lost producer Carlton Cuse, [...] "The relationships [...] expect on the show are not necessarily the ones that we [...] necessarily are going to give you, but we want to try to find ways in which characters that you don't expect to kind of connect to one another to connect in ways that are kind of surprising." ...|$|E
500|$|When the {{producers}} were auditioning actors for roles in Lost, Harold Perrineau {{was in the}} area. The producers called it a [...] "natural move" [...] to have him audition. Although initially skeptical about the show, he took the role when Lost creator J. J. Abrams explained more about it. A lot of children were seen {{for the role of}} Walt. They were narrowed down to the top three, with Malcolm David Kelley winning it, after {{the producers}} were impressed with his role in Antwone Fisher. [...] Abrams had worked with Terry O'Quinn previously on Alias, and was keen to work with him again. He explained to O'Quinn that although the role in the first episodes would be fairly small, the character will develop afterwards. O'Quinn took the role as he trusted Abrams. He was also the only character who did not have to officially audition for a part of a main character. The producers were looking for someone who had a [...] "Paris Hilton quality" [...] to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. [...] <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> were auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace. She was written to be an antipathetic character in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. Unlike many other characters of the first season, who were rewritten based on their actors, Boone was largely the same through production. He was originally going to be named Boone Anthony Markham V, going by the nickname, [...] "Five". Ian Somerhalder was cast in the role, but {{he did not want to}} shoot a pilot; however, he jumped at the opportunity once he found out he would be working with Abrams.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of 2000, Lewinsky began {{appearing}} in television commercials for the diet company Jenny Craig, Inc. The $1 million endorsement deal, which required Lewinsky to lose 40 or more pounds in six months, gained considerable publicity at the time. Lewinsky said that despite her desire {{to return to a}} more private life, she needed the money to pay off legal fees, and she believed in the product. A Jenny Craig spokesperson said of Lewinsky, [...] "She represents a busy active woman of today with a hectic lifestyle. And she has had weight issues and weight struggles for a long time. That represents <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in America." [...] The choice of Lewinsky as a role model proved controversial for Jenny Craig, and some of its private franchises switched to an older advertising campaign. The company stopped running the Lewinsky ads in February 2000, concluded her campaign entirely in April 2000, and paid her only $300,000 of the $1 million contracted for her involvement.|$|E
2500|$|In Kansas City Bomber Raquel Welch {{played a}} {{hardened}} derby star and single mother {{that tries to}} balance her desire for a happy personal life and her dreams of stardom. Life dubbed Welch the “hottest thing on wheels” for her role. The production of the film shut down for six weeks after Welch broke her wrist doing some of her own stunts. In the interim, she flew to Budapest and filmed a cameo in Bluebeard (1972) opposite Richard Burton. Although Kansas City Bomber was not considered a critical success, it vividly depicted gender relations in the early 1970s. In a 2012 interview with GQ, Welch reflected on the roller derby world depicted in the film: [...] "You have all those women out there, but {{the men in the}} front office are really running it.

2500|$|Described to {{the court}} {{as the leader of}} the Sandy Row women's UDA unit, Elizabeth Douglas (Sr), who had ordered the fatal {{punishment}} beating, pleaded guilty to manslaughter. The charge of murder was withdrawn on the grounds that she had not actually intended for her [...] "Heavy Squad" [...] to kill Ogilby and she was subsequently sentenced to ten years' imprisonment in Armagh Prison. She received two further sentences (which were to run concurrently with her 10 years) of three years each, for intimidation and detaining Ogilby against her will. [...] The exact motive for the murder was not established in court. During police interrogation, Douglas maintained that Ogilby's killing was the result of a personal vendetta, stating [...] "It was not a UDA operation, they had nothing to do with it. It was just a move between <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> a personal thing". In his book The Protestants of Ulster which was published in 1976, Geoffrey Bell stated that the women murdered her as punishment for her affair with William Young. Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack suggested that jealousy and bloodlust were the motives for the murder. The others received lesser sentences: Albert Graham and Josephine Brown, after pleading guilty, were sentenced to three years imprisonment on charges of being accessories after the fact and causing grievous bodily harm to Ann Ogilby; the Crown withdrew the murder charge against the pair after recognising their attempt to prevent Cowan and Smith from continuing with the fatal beating. The unit's second-in-command, Kathleen Whitla was given two years for intimidation; Maud Tait (21), Anne Gracey (28), Elizabeth Douglas, Jr (19) and Marie Lendrum (23), were all sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for intimidation, and an unnamed 16-year-old was given an 18-months suspended sentence for intimidation.

2500|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1995, Velasquez had begun to work on her sixth studio album, My Love Emotion. She enlisted Japanese songwriters and producers such as Mariya Takeuchi, Kazufumi Miyazawa, and Tatsushi Umeyaki during the album’s recording. Although, My Love Emotion was well received by most critics, some of them criticized it for being {{very similar to the}} formula used on Listen Without Prejudice. David Gonzales from AllMusic described it as [...] "an even better album" [...] and mentioned that it is [...] "more modern and contemporary in tone throughout". However, he felt the similarity from her previous album and noted that the [...] "style of music , have played a large role on Velasquez's albums [...] she doesn't abandon it entirely." [...] The record’s lead single, [...] "My Love Emotion", saw Velasquez collaborate with Southern Sons’ lead guitarist and vocalist, Phil Buckle. After their initial meeting at the Perfect 10 Music Awards in Singapore, Buckle began writing material for the album. The song he had written eventually became the title of the record as well. AllMusic contributor, David Gonzales, called the title track [...] "a triumph" [...] and described it as [...] "an outstanding vehicle, containing a strong melody and hook in the chorus." [...] He further merited Velasquez’s [...] "strong, emotive, and confident" [...] singing. The album’s follow-up single, [...] "You’ve Made Me Stronger", maintained the record’s adult contemporary thematic and reunited Velasquez with songwriter and record producer, Trina Belamide, who had a brief role during the production of her first album under PolyCosmic Records. Speaking of the song’s significant impact on women’s empowerment, Belamide said that it’s a [...] "healing a song [...] it’s about making a bad situation work for you." [...] Velasquez also remarked that the song’s influence has [...] "helped <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> reeling from broken hearts." [...] Music critics also complimented Velasquez’s use of a [...] "comfortable register instead of aiming for a higher one, as she did all too often on her previous album, and which made her voice sound thin and unappealing at times." [...] Though the album managed a combined regional and domestic sales of over 375,000 units, My Love Emotion failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor.|$|E
