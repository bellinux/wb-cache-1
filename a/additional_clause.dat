25|$|Passed on 17 July 1973, {{the first}} amended {{was made to}} the Article 47 of the constitution. The {{amendment}} inserted an <b>additional</b> <b>clause,</b> Article 47(3) that allowed punishment and prosecution of war criminals under international law. A new Article 47A was also added, which specified that certain fundamental rights will be inapplicable in those cases.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, the Imperial Household Ordinance on Imperial Family Dress was promulgated, and an <b>additional</b> <b>clause</b> in it {{abolished}} the pertinent Dajō-kan edicts of 1873 and 1876. This order defined {{two levels of}} formal dress, changed the chrysanthemum foliage scrollwork to use a sakura motif instead, and specified fully closed mandarin collars. However, as Imperial Family members were now supposed to wear the uniforms of their offices if they held any, and most princes were appointed as officers in the military or navy unless {{there was a reason}} not to, most wore military uniforms, and these new uniforms for the Imperial Family saw little actual use.|$|E
25|$|As the {{expiration}} of the Joint Occupation treaty approached, {{a second round}} of negotiations commenced in 1824. American Minister Richard Rush offered for the extension of agreement with an <b>additional</b> <b>clause</b> on 2 April. The 51° parallel would be a provisional border within the Pacific Northwest, with no British additional settlements to be established south of the line, nor any American settlements north of it. Despite Rush's offering to modify the temporary border to the 49° parallel, the British negotiators rejected his offer. His proposal was seen as the likely basis for the eventual division of the Pacific Northwest. The British plenipotentiaries William Huskisson and Stratford Canning on 29 June pressed instead for a permanent line along the 49° parallel west until the main branch of the Columbia River. With the British formally abandoning claims south or east of the Columbia River, the Oregon Question thence became focused on what later became Western Washington and the southern portion of Vancouver Island. Rush reacted to the British proposal as unfavorably as they had to his own offer, leaving the talks at a stalemate.|$|E

25|$|Greenleaf and Morris {{purchased}} 6,000 lots {{under the}} same conditions as the September agreement. At least 1,500 of these lots {{had to be in}} the northeast quadrant of the District of Columbia, but Greenleaf could take his pick of lots anywhere else in the city for the remainder. The monthly loan to the commissioners also increased, to $2,660 per commissioner per month. An <b>additional</b> <b>clause</b> required that the 6,000 lots include 428.5 lots on Buzzard Point owned by Notley Young (a plantation owner in Prince George's County, Maryland) and 220 lots on Buzzard Point owned by Daniel Carroll (a Founding Father and Maryland landowner whose farm was used to form the District of Columbia). The contract also included provisions (identical to those in the September 23 contract) which required no down payment; did not require the first payment until May 1, 1794; required only annual payments of one-sixth of the total amount of the purchase price annually thereafter; and did not impose any interest. With these transactions, Greenleaf and his co-investors now controlled about half the federal government's salable land in the District of Columbia.|$|E
500|$|The Boulogne {{agreement}} {{had little}} immediate impact, and is notable mostly for {{its influence on}} a later document presented in parliament in April that year. In the meanwhile, on 25 February, the king had been crowned. Before the coronation, the king {{had been forced to}} include an <b>additional</b> <b>clause</b> in his coronation oath. The king obliged himself to abide by the law, but this exact meaning of this promise was ambiguous. The clause referred to laws the people [...] "shall have chosen" [...] (aura eslu), which left it unclear whether it also included future enactments. At the coronation ceremony that followed, Gaveston acted with such presumption and arrogance as to further alienate the leading magnates.|$|E
500|$|The {{document}} {{from the}} April parliament, today {{referred to as}} the Declaration of 1308, contained three articles and was presented by the Earl of Lincoln. The first article invoked the so-called [...] "doctrine of capacities": that the subjects of the realm owed allegiance to the institution of the Crown, not to the person of the King. If the King abused his position, it was his subject's duty to correct this, thereby upholding the pledge of the Boulogne agreement {{to protect the rights of}} the Crown. The second article was an attack on Gavestonthough he was not mentioned by nameimplicitly demanding his renewed exile. The third article referred to the <b>additional</b> <b>clause</b> from the coronation oath. It was here taken to mean that the king had obliged himself to abide by any decisions made by his subjects; past, present or future. The king initially held out against the opposition, but the earls also received support from Philippe IV, who was offended by Edward's apparent preference of Gaveston over Isabella. On 18 May Edward agreed to once again send Gaveston into exile.|$|E

40|$|Interest in propositional satisfiability (SAT) {{has been}} on the rise lately, spurred in part by the recent {{availability}} of powerful solvers that are sufficiently efficient and robust to deal with the large-scale SAT problems that typically arise in electronic design automation application. In this paper we experimentally compare two recent search procedures: recursive learning and conflict diagnosis. Both techniques {{can be viewed as a}} form of dynamic identification of "useful" implicates of the function being tested. We also examine the performance of the basic Davis-Putnam search on variants of the input formula that are augmented statically, in a pre-processing step, with <b>additional</b> <b>clauses.</b> The broad conclusions of the paper are that supplanting the input formula with more clauses has the potential of significantly reducing the search effort. This gain, however, must be weighed against the extra effort required to generate the <b>additional</b> <b>clauses...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Most public {{opposition}} to the Bill came from conservative Christian groups, who believed that it made even [...] "light smacking" [...] of children illegal.

6000|$|The {{dismissal}} of Mr. Grenville from the cabinet gave a temporary change to public affairs. The stamp act was repealed on the 18th of March, 1766, {{to the great}} joy of the sincere friends of both countries, still, there was a fatal clause in the repeal, which declared that the king, {{with the consent of}} Parliament, had power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient force and validity to [...] "bind the colonies, and people of America, in all cases whatsoever." [...] As the people of America were contending for principles, not mere pecuniary interests, this reserved power of the crown and Parliament left the dispute still open, and chilled the feeling of gratitude which the repeal might otherwise have inspired. Further aliment for public discontent was furnished by other acts of Parliament. One imposed duties on glass, pasteboard, white and red lead, painters' colors, and tea; the duties to be collected on the arrival of the articles in the colonies; another empowered naval officers to enforce the acts of trade and navigation. Another wounded to the quick the pride and sensibilities of New York. The mutiny act had recently been extended to America, with an <b>additional</b> <b>clause,</b> requiring the provincial Assemblies to provide the troops sent out with quarters, and to furnish them with fire, beds, candles, and other necessaries, {{at the expense of the}} colonies. The Governor and Assembly of New York refused to comply with this requisition as to stationary forces, insisting that it applied only to troops on a march. An act of Parliament now suspended the powers of the governor and Assembly until they should comply.|$|E
50|$|Not all clauses of all {{amendments}} {{have been}} incorporated. For example, {{states are not}} required to obey the Fifth Amendment's requirement of indictment by grand jury. Many states choose to use preliminary hearings instead of grand juries. It is possible that future cases may incorporate <b>additional</b> <b>clauses</b> of the Bill of Rights against the states.|$|R

An act of Parliament now suspended the powers of the governor and Assembly until they should comply. Chatham attributed this opposition of the colonists to the mutiny act to [...] "their jealousy of being somehow or other taxed internally by the Parliament; the act," [...] said he, [...] "asserting the right of Parliament, has certainly spread a most unfortunate jealousy and diffidence of government here throughout America, and makes them jealous of the least distinction between this country and that, lest the same principle may be extended to taxing them."

40|$|Five of {{the most}} {{important}} currencies compose the SDR, the currency cocktail which is. {{at the base of the}} International Monetary System. Violent swings on the foreign exchange markets and greatest uncertainty of interest rates plead for a more frequent use of currency cocktails international operators. Both the Ecu and the SDR should have been more present in international finance. This article presents and analyses two international transactions in which the SDR was selected as unit of account: the first one is a syndicated loan to the Kingdom of Sweden and the second one a syndicated loan to the Republic of the Ivory Coast. A comparison of the two credits is presented and their differences are exposed. The author concludes that the SDR could be, in practice, very different from a private transaction to the next. <b>Additional</b> <b>clauses</b> are required when a currency cocktail is selected for a euro-credit : the definition of the SDR, the definition of the dollar-value of the SDR, the difficulty of the calculation of the interest rates, the problems of foreign exchange quotations make <b>additional</b> <b>clauses</b> necessary. As a consequence, the documentation of a SDR credit is more complex than in the case of a classic US dollar facility...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we aim to improve the runtime of the {{state-of-the-art}} March SAT solver. We apply a technique known as extended resolution on uniform random 3 -SAT formulae; we add <b>additional</b> <b>clauses,</b> derived from the original formula, trying to guide the solver into {{the direction of a}} viable solution. Depending on a heuristic which we introduce, we add certain patterns to the formula to aid the solver. This method will be tested both unforced and forced: the unforced method lets the solver choose whether to include the <b>additional</b> <b>clauses</b> or not, in forced solving the patterns are used anyway. The latter might turn a satisfiable problem into an unsatisfiable one, however results still are very promising: a speed up of about 18 % on the average. Also, {{at the end of this}} document some valuable insights into new studies can be found, which may lead to even more substantial improvements.
