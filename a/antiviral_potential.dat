Initially, AMP have been studied and proposed as alternative therapies for infectious diseases. However, there have been an increasing number of studies proposing that AMP also have a cytotoxic activity against tumour cells. Further development of the biological function of these peptides during tumour development and progression will aid in the development of new, less harmful antitumour therapies. The tumour microenvironment is characterised by the presence of a complex network of cellular interactions involving both proinflammatory and suppressive cells. Components of the complement system play an important role during inflammation and modulating the innate immune response during infection. In addition, complement plays a role in the immune response to cancer and possibly in the trafficking of cells in the tumour microenvironment.

Anti NDV activity was determined by absence/lower cytopathic effect (CPE) in CEF and lower HA titer of cell culture supernatant. Anti IBDV activity was determined by absence/lower CPE in CEF. Besides in vivo antiviral effects of HAE of OS and AM against NDV and IBDV were evaluated in chicken model. 250 mg/kg body weight oral dose of HAE of OS and AM was found ideal and nontoxic in chickens and experimental chickens were fed this dose for 21 days for determination of in vivo antiviral effect.

Taking {{advantage of}} this property, we developed a simple and sensitive method to evaluate potential inhibitors of HIV- 1 assembly in a living cell system. Two proteins were coexpressed in recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf 9 cells, Pr 55 Gag, which formed the VLP backbone, and luciferase fused to the N-terminus of Vpr (LucVpr). VLP-encapsidated LucVpr retained the enzymatic activity of free luciferase. The levels of luciferase activity present in the pelletable fraction recovered from the culture medium correlated with the amounts of extracellular VLP released by Sf 9 cells assayed by conventional immunological methods. Our luciferase-based assay was then applied to the characterization of betulinic acid (BA) derivatives that differed from the leader compound PA- 457 (or DSB) by their substituant on carbon- 28.
