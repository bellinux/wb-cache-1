I still can't believe how well they pulled off the mystery. I did NOT see Aaron Echolls as the killer." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a glowing review, praising the Keith-Veronica dynamic, the conclusions to the story arcs, and the final sequence after it is revealed that Aaron is the murderer. [...] "It’s also an interesting choice to have the reveal come {{about two-thirds of the}} way through the episode, and have the episode end with a dramatic chase and fight scene. Veronica has so rarely been in direct personal danger that having Aaron Echolls chase and capture her, and having Keith show up for a brutal fight and rescue, is jarring. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> effective."

Gigi Javier-Alfonso of The Philippine Daily Tribune noted, [...] "Santos is superior in her performance in this brave new film [...] quite sympathetic and certainly not painted as villain", whilst Lito B.

2500|$|On April 25, 2008, Entertainment Tonight {{reported}} that 15-year-old Miley Cyrus had posed topless {{for a photo}} shoot with Vanity Fair. The photograph and subsequently released behind-the-scenes photographs show Cyrus topless, her bare back exposed but her front covered with a bedsheet. The photo was taken by Leibovitz. The full photograph was published with an accompanying story on The New York Times website on April 27, 2008. On April 29, 2008, The New York Times clarified: though the pictures left an impression that she was bare-breasted, Cyrus was wrapped in a bedsheet and was actually not topless. Some parents expressed outrage at {{the nature of the}} photograph, which a Disney spokesperson described as [...] "a situation [...] was created to deliberately manipulate a 15-year-old in order to sell magazines". [...] In response to the Internet circulation of the photo and ensuing media attention, Cyrus released a statement of apology on April 27: I took part in a photo shoot {{that was supposed to be}} 'artistic' and now, seeing the photographs and reading the story, I feel so embarrassed. I never intended for any of this to happen and I apologize to my fans who I care so deeply about.

2500|$|Like a Prayer {{was named}} after the {{influence}} of Catholicism on Madonna's early {{life as well as}} her struggles with religion; [...] "The theme of Catholicism runs rampant", she said. [...] "It's me struggling with the mystery and magic that surrounds it. My own Catholicism is in constant upheaval." [...] Recording sessions took place from September 1988 to January 1989. On January 27, 1989, a press release from The Albany Herald said the album would include [...] "a number of hot dance tracks" [...] but noted, [...] "much of the material [...] is of a personal tone." [...] The singer described it as a collection of songs [...] "about my mother, my father, and bonds with my family. [...] It's taken a lot of guts to do this". She also said that it would be her [...] "most different" [...] work to date; [...] "It was a real coming-of-age record for me emotionally, I had {{to do a lot of}} soul-searching, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a reflection of that [...] I didn't try to candy-coat anything or make it more palatable for mass consumption, I wrote what I felt". She told Rolling Stone magazine [...] "In the past, my records tended to be a reflection of current influences. This album is more about past musical influences". She chose to collaborate with Stephen Bray and Patrick Leonard, with whom she had collaborated on her previous studio album True Blue (1986) and the soundtrack Who's That Girl (1987). Both Bray and Leonard wanted to bring their unique style to the project, and they developed completely different music for the title track. Eventually, Madonna felt that the music presented to her by Leonard was more interesting, and she started to work with him. According to the singer, Leonard was also facing emotional turmoil; [...] "I was working with Pat, who was also in a very dark state of mind, and we worked in a very isolated place in the Valley". On January 6, 1989, following a nullified divorce filing in late 1987 and several publicized fights, one of which led to a 60-day prison term, Madonna and Sean Penn filed for divorce. [...] This incident inspired the song [...] "Till Death Do Us Part". The rest of the songs were written within two weeks; with [...] "Like a Prayer", [...] "Cherish" [...] and [...] "Spanish Eyes" [...] being written the first week. According to Leonard, [...] "we wrote a song a day, and we didn't change them. And oftentimes the vocal that she did was the lead vocal, we didn't even change the lead vocal. That was it. She sang it. It was done".|$|E
