40|$|AbstractObjective: An {{alternate}} (second) adult recipient {{list was}} used to match excluded potential recipients with nonstandard donor hearts {{that would otherwise be}} unused. Methods: The only absolute criterion for entering the <b>alternate</b> <b>recipient</b> list was age: 65 years old before 1998 and 70 years old after that. Group I consisted of alternates who underwent transplantation, and group II consisted of 401 contemporaneous recipients. Hearts were first offered to regularly listed patients. At least one of the following donor risks accounted for allocation to an alternate: coronary artery disease, reused transplanted heart, high-risk behavior, hepatitis seropositivity, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, high inotropic requirement, left ventricular hypertrophy, age older than 55 years plus another risk, and small donor with no other matches. Results: Of 102 alternates, 82 were listed were because of age. After a median wait of 107 days, 62 alternates underwent transplantation. Median <b>alternate</b> <b>recipient</b> age was 67 years (vs 54 years, P 90 days) death rates per 1000 person-months were 4. 3 and 3. 6 for groups I and II (relative risk 1. 2, 0. 62 - 2. 36). Conclusions: Use of two adult recipient lists facilitated allocation of unused donor organs. Satisfactory long-term survival supports the use of an <b>alternate</b> <b>recipient</b> list.

40|$|Improving email {{reliability}} by sender retransmission While email {{is fairly}} reliable, messages do get lost. This can {{be due to}} the store-and-forward nature of email, which passes responsibility for delivering email from one mail server to another, but in doing so exposes messages to loss, should a server not fulfil its responsibility. Some end users are more sensitive to email unreliability than others, and seek tools with which they can detect and recover from email failures. This paper describes tools that allow email sending software to automatically respond to reports of undeliverability by persisting with retransmission or retransmitting to <b>alternate</b> <b>recipients.</b> 1...|$|R
5000|$|... "Aloha ʻOe" [...] (Farewell to Thee) is Liliʻuokalani's {{most famous}} song {{and a common}} {{cultural}} symbol for Hawaii. The story {{of the origin of}} the song has several variations. [...] They all have in common that the song was inspired by a notable farewell embrace given by Colonel James Harbottle Boyd during a horseback trip taken by Princess Liliʻuokalani in 1877 or 1878 to the Boyd ranch in Maunawili on the windward side of Oʻahu, and that the members of the party hummed the tune {{on the way back to}} Honolulu. Different versions tell of <b>alternate</b> <b>recipients</b> of the embrace [...] - [...] either Liliʻuokalani's sister Princess Likelike Cleghorn or a young lady at the ranch. According to the most familiar version of the story:This tender farewell set Liliʻuokalani to thinking, and she began humming to herself on the homeward trip. Overhearing, Charles Wilson observed, [...] "That sounds like The Lone Rock by the Sea," [...] a comment with which Liliʻuokalani is said to have agreed. When the party paused to rest in an orange grove on the Honolulu side of the Pali, the others joined in the hummings, and the song was completed later at Washington Place.|$|R
40|$|Measurement of GFR with non-radioisotopic radiocontrast agents. The {{clearance}} of creatinine {{has been}} shown to overestimate GFR in patients with renal disease and in kidney transplant <b>recipients.</b> <b>Alternate</b> means for measuring GFR involve the use of constant infusion and, frequently, of radioisotopes. We report herein the measurement of GFR {{with the use of a}} radiocontrast agent (diatrizoate meglumine) injected subcutaneously with a small amount of epinephrine (0. 05 ml of 1 : 1000). The concentrations of this marker of glomerular filtration in blood and in urine were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography. The results demonstrate that with this method of administration stable blood levels are observed for at least three hours. Furthermore, creatinine clearance overestimated GFR by 50 % and by 68 % in patients with renal disease and in renal transplant recipients, respectively. This method offers several advantages: 1) the use of commonly available and inexpensive materials; 2) obviates the need for the use of constant infusions; and 3) avoids the use of radioisotopes...|$|R
