This {{was done by the}} apparent metabolizable energy (AME) method of total excreta collection using mature White Leghorn cockerels. Since the <b>AA</b> <b>availability</b> values were not corrected for metabolic plus endo-genous AA losses they were called apparent <b>AA</b> <b>availability</b> (AAAA) values. A sample of soybean meal (SBM) and Tower and Candle rapeseed meals (RSM) were also included in the experiment. The AAAA values for the whole and ground RS of any particular cultivar did not differ significant-ly. The values for Tower RS were higher than those for the Candle RS or the two RSM. However, compared with those of the RS and RSM, the SBM showed somewhat higher AAAA values. The AME values of whole Tower and Candle RS were much lower than the corresponding values obtained with ground seed. Furthermore, Candle RS, whole or ground, was lower in AME content than the corresponding values for Tower rapeseed. The Tower and Candle RSM were similar in their AME contents but lower than the SBM. The AAAA and AME results with RS showed that while grinding increased the AME values of the seeds, it did not enhance their <b>AA</b> <b>availabilities...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the time course of the response of human muscle protein synthesis (MPS) to a square wave increase in availability of amino acids (AAs) in plasma. We investigated the responses of quadriceps MPS to a ≈ 1. 7 -fold increase in plasma AA concentrations using an intravenous infusion of 162 mg (kg body weight) − 1 h− 1 of mixed AAs. MPS was estimated from D 3 -leucine labelling in protein after a primed, constant intravenous infusion of D 3 -ketoisocaproate, increased appropriately during AA infusion. Muscle was separated into myofibrillar, sarcoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions. MPS, both of mixed muscle and of fractions, was estimated during a basal period (2. 5 h) and at 0. 5 - 4 h intervals for 6 h of AA infusion. Rates of mixed MPS were not significantly different from basal (0. 076 ± 0. 008 % h− 1) in the first 0. 5 h of AA infusion but then rose rapidly to a peak after 2 h of ≈ 2. 8 times the basal value. Thereafter, rates declined rapidly to the basal value. All muscle fractions showed a similar pattern. The results suggest that MPS responds rapidly to increased <b>availability</b> of <b>AAs</b> but is then inhibited, despite continued <b>AA</b> <b>availability.</b> These results suggest that the fed state accretion of muscle protein may be limited by a metabolic mechanism whenever the requirement for substrate for protein synthesis is exceeded...|$|R

40|$|After {{crude oil}} extraction, {{separation}} and treatment {{are probably the}} most important stages within different oil and gas business processes. Efficiency to separate crude oil from water and gas is directly related with production outputs and profits of oil companies. Ecopetrol S. A. being Colombia’s national oil production company has many different production facilities, being the Superintendence of Castilla – Chichimene one of the largest ones, producing a third of the total oil amount produced by Ecopetrol which borders up to 560. 000 barrels of oil per day. The present study develops a reliability and availability analysis of Castilla 2 crude oil treatment station, which is the leading separation plant of the Superintendence, having paramount relevance on final oil production rates. The aim of this work is set on the identification of critical bottle necks and underperforming equipment within the process that can affect the overall availability of the treatment station, developing a model able to provide valuable information for decision making processes related with the sustainability or improvement of current production goals through the assessment of <b>achievable</b> <b>availability</b> and reliability values. In order to develop a realistic analysis, recognition of critical equipment is made and its results used to propose a plant grouping model based on functional blocks, systems and main processes. Moreover, real maintenance information has been retrieved from different existing databases and used to construct and define parameters of individual failure distributions on each one of the equipment selected for the study. A reliability block diagram capable to describe functional relationships of the elements, systems and processes of the treatment plant was developed. Through this model, quantitative analysis and measurements were made allowing identification of elements and combinations prone to generate major downtime. Several availability simulation were used to find sensitive points within the plant that can affect overall production goals, while proposed actions and plant modifications were introduced into the model to assess their benefits and effectiveness towards production and availability improvement.

A new O-antigen modification with phosphoethanolamine has been identified. The presence of this antigenic determinant (called E 1037) is recognized by monoclonal antibody MASF IV- 1. Given the increasing incidence of these new variants and the difficulty in supplying the monoclonal antibody to our country, we produced a polyclonal antiserum (AA 479) through immunization with a S. flexneri Xv strain. The antiserum specificity was assessed by slide agglutination against isolates from clinical cases and a culture collection representing all Shigella serotypes.

Tripling <b>AA</b> <b>availability</b> at 5 mU/l insulin doubled incorporation of [1 - 13 C]leucine [i. e., muscle protein synthesis (MPS), P < 0. 01] without affecting the rate of leg protein breakdown (LPB; appearance of d 5 -phenylalanine). While keeping <b>AA</b> <b>availability</b> constant, increasing insulin to 30 mU/l halved LPB (P < 0. 05) without further inhibition at higher doses, whereas rates of MPS were identical to that at 5 mU/l insulin. The phosphorylation of PKB Ser 473 and p 70 S 6 k Thr 389 increased concomitantly with insulin, but whereas raising insulin to 30 mU/l increased the phosphorylation of mTOR Ser 2448, 4 E-BP 1 Thr 37 / 46, or GSK 3 β Ser 9 and decreased that of eEF 2 Thr 56, higher insulin doses to 72 and 167 mU/l did not augment these latter responses. MAFbx and proteasome C 2 subunit proteins declined as insulin increased, with MuRF- 1 expression largely unchanged.

However, the roles of specific AAs in T 1 R 1 /T 1 R 3 -regulated mTORC 1 are poorly defined. In this study, T 1 R 1 and T 1 R 3 subunits were expressed in C 2 C 12 myotubes, and l-AA sensing was accomplished by T 1 R 1 /T 1 R 3 to activate mTORC 1. In response to l-AAs, such as serine (Ser), arginine (Arg), threonine (Thr), alanine (Ala), methionine (Met), glutamine (Gln), and glycine (Gly), Met induced mTORC 1 activation and promoted protein synthesis.

To study the absorptive capacity of amino acids during mucositis, we determined the plasma availability of enterally administered amino acids (AA), their utilization for protein synthesis, and the preferential side of the intestine for AA uptake in rats with and without methotrexate (MTX) -induced mucositis. Four days after injection with MTX (60 mg/kg) or saline (controls), rats received a primed, continuous dual-isotope infusion (intraduodenal and intravenous) of labeled L-leucine, L-lysine, L-phenylalanine, L-threonine, and L-methionine. We collected blood samples, assessed jejunal histology, and determined labeled AA incorporation in proximal and distal small intestinal mucosa, plasma albumin, liver, and thigh muscle. MTX-induced mucositis was confirmed by histology. The median systemic <b>availability</b> of all <b>AA</b> except for leucine was similar in MTX-treated rats and in controls. However, the individual <b>availability</b> of all <b>AA</b> differed substantially within the group of MTX-treated rats, ranging from severely reduced (40 % of intake in 5 of 9 rats). More AA originating from basolateral uptake than those originating from apical uptake were used for intestinal protein synthesis in MTX-treated rats (>= 420 % more, P < 0. 05). We conclude that continuous enteral administration can enable normal AA absorption in rats with MTX-induced mucositis.

40|$|As {{our daily}} life is {{becoming}} more dependent on wireless and mobile services, seamless network connectivity is of utmost importance. Wireless networks are expected to handle the growing demand for applications which require higher capacity, without failure. Therein, wireless connectivity is regarded as an essential requirement {{for a wide range}} of applications in order to support exible and cost-e ective services. As part of the fth generation (5 G) communication paradigm, ultra reliable communication (URC) is envisaged as an important technology pillar for providing anywhere and anytime services to end users. While most existing studies on reliable communication are not pursued from a dependability perspective, those dependability based studies tend to de ne reliability merely in the time domain. The main objective of this thesis work is to advocate the concept of URC from a dependability perspective in the space domain. Accordingly, we de ne cell availability, system availability, and guaranteed availability for cellular networks. Poisson point process (PPP) and Voronoi tessellation are adopted to model the spatial characteristics of cell deployment in cellular networks. The spatially modeled cellular networks are used to analyze availability and initiate de nitions on cell availability and system availability. Correspondingly, the availability as well as the probability of providing a guaranteed level of availability in a network are analyzed both/either cell-wise and/or system-wise. From this perspective, we investigate in depth the relationship between the signal to interference noise ratio (SINR), capacity or user requirement and <b>achievable</b> <b>availability</b> levels. Extensive simulations are performed for various network scenarios and cell deployments to obtain numerical results based on the cell and system availability de nitions. For SINRbased and capacity-based studies, threshold contours are identi ed in each case in order to further study cell availability under di erent conditions. The importance of deploying di erent types of cells for a cellular network is also highlighted by studying the tradeo between the required transmission power and the obtained system availability. Moreover, de nitions are developed for availability from users' perspective concerning PPP distributed users as well. In a nutshell, this thesis proposes a novel concept referred to as space domain availability as a contribution to the ongoing research activities on URC for future 5 G networks.

40|$|El pdf del artículo es la versión pre-print. Arachidonic acid (AA) and its oxygenated derivatives, collectively {{known as}} the eicosanoids, are key {{mediators}} {{of a wide variety}} of physiological and pathophysiological states. AA, obtained from the diet or synthesized from linoleic acid, is rapidly incorporated into cellular phospholipids by the concerted action of arachidonoyl-CoA synthetase and lysophospholipid acyltransferases. Under the appropriate conditions, AA is liberated from its phospholipid storage sites by the action of one or various phospholipase A 2 enzymes. Thus, cellular <b>availability</b> of <b>AA,</b> and hence the amount of eicosanoids produced, depends on an exquisite balance between phospholipid reacylation and hydrolysis reactions.

40|$|OBJECTIVES Fruit and {{vegetable}} intake (FVI) is below recommended levels among {{adolescents in the}} U. S., especially among low-income populations and minorities at higher risk for diet-related disease. The main objective {{of this study was}} to explore household, demographic and personal factors related to FVI in a sample of low-income minority adolescents from five schools in Austin, Texas. Secondary objectives were to look for factors related to household access & <b>availability</b> (<b>AA)</b> and to address the implications of a food-gardening related intervention in this sample. METHODS Cross-sectional baseline data taken in January 2009 for the Sprouting Healthy Kids intervention evaluation was analyzed. The sample included 194 primarily low-income, Hispanic parent and student pairs. Parent and student questionnaires were compared to identify independent demographic (DFs), household (HFs) and personal factors (PFs) of FVI in students. Social Cognitive Theory and the Social Ecological Model formed the basis of the theoretical framework for this study. Predictive Analytic SoftWare Statistics (SPSS) Version 18 was used to perform bivariate analysis and multiple linear regression. RESULTS Mean FVI for both the student and parent sample was below recommendations. A large percent of the variance in student FVI was explained by the HFs. The model that explained the greatest variance in FVI (AR 2 =. 33, p<. 001) included a combination of DFs, HFs and PFs. Among factors in all models, household AA and parent FVI had the strongest association with student FVI. These relationships remained strong when adjusted for PFs. None of the PFs measured had a significant association with student FVI once adjusted for HFs & DFs. Students who had more experience growing food, liked cooking FV, and whose family ate homegrown FV more often had a higher FVI, but this may be confounded by other factors. Several HFs, including adult support and experience growing FV had a moderate, unadjusted correlation with Household AA in this sample. CONCLUSION Findings from this study support other studies which have found household AA and parent FVI to be highly associated with young persons’ FVI. Since no causal relationships can be determined with this study design, future research that includes qualitative focus groups and longitudinal methods is warranted. Current interventions targeted towards parents and FV AA in the household should be evaluated for effectiveness and increased. Food gardening may indeed be an effective method to increase FVI in students and parents in this sample, however more research is needed to determine whether this method is well-received by the target population (low-income Hispanics). ...|$|R

40|$|Mammalian cells {{accumulate}} vitamin C {{either as}} ascorbic acid (AA), via Na +-AA co-transport, or dehydroascorbic acid (DHA, the oxidation product of AA), via facilitative hexose transport. As the latter, unlike the former, is a high-capacity transport mechanism, cultured cells normally accumulate {{greater levels of}} vitamin C when exposed to increasing concentrations of DHA as compared with AA. We report herein similar results using the U 937 cell clone used in our laboratory only under conditions in which DHA and AA are used at concentrations greater than 50 - 60 m. Below 60 m, i. e. at levels in which AA is normally found in most biological fluids, AA and DHA are in fact taken up with identical rates and kinetics. Consequently, extracellular oxidation of AA switches the mode of uptake with hardly any effect on the net amount of vitamin C accumulated. As a final note, under these conditions, neither AA nor DHA causes detectable toxicity or {{any change in the}} redox status of the cells, as assessed by the reduced glutathione/reduced pyridine nucleotide pool. These findings therefore imply that some cell types do not have a preferential route for vitamin C accumulation, and that the uptake mechanism is uniquely dependent on the extracellular <b>availability</b> of <b>AA</b> v.

We report here that arachidonic acid (AA) plays {{a pivotal role in}} this response, which was consistently reproduced in different glial cell lines and in primary rat astrocytes. This notion was established using pharmacological inhibitors of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2), cytosolic PLA 2 (cPLA 2) antisense oligonucleotides, and AA add-back experiments. This approach not only allowed the demonstration that AA promotes inhibition of NOS-I activity but also produced novel experimental evidence that LPS/ IFN_ itself is a potential stimulus for NOS-I. Indeed, LPS/IFN_ fails to generate nitric oxide (NO) via NOS-I activation simply because it activates the AA-dependent signal that impedes NOS-I activity. Otherwise, LPS/ IFN_ promotes NO formation, sensitive to exogenous AA, in cells in which cPLA 2 is pharmacologically inhibited or genetically depleted. Because NO suppresses the NF_B-dependent NOS-II expression, inactivation of NOS-I by the LPS/IFN_-induced AA pathway provides optimal conditions for NF_B activation and subsequent NOS-II expression. Inhibition of cPLA 2 activity, while reducing the <b>availability</b> of <b>AA,</b> consistently inhibited NF_B activation and NOS-II mRNA induction and delayed NO formation.

We investigated {{whether there is an}} amino acid composition bias (AACB) inherent in discrete subsets of proteins, and whether we could identify changing patterns of AACB during the life cycle of the social bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. We quantitatively characterised the cellular, soluble secreted, and outer membrane vesicle (OMV) sub-proteomes of M. xanthus, identifying 315 proteins. The AACB of the cellular proteome differed only slightly from that deduced from the genome, suggesting that genome-inferred proteomes can accurately reflect the AACB of their host. Inferred AA deficiencies arising from prey consumption were exacerbated by the requirements of the 68 %GC genome, whose character thus seems to be selected for directly rather than via the proteome. In our analysis, distinct subsets of the proteome (whether segregated spatially or temporally) exhibited distinct AACB, presumably tailored according {{to the needs of the}} organism's lifestyle and nutrient <b>availability.</b> Secreted <b>AAs</b> tend to be of lower cost than those retained in the cell, except for the early developmental A-signal, which is a particularly costly sub-proteome.

40|$|Despite {{the strong}} {{association}} between protein catabolic conditions and hyperglucagonemia, and enhanced glucagon secretion by amino acids (AA), glucagon’s effects on protein metabolism remain less clear than on glucose metabolism. To clearly define glucagon’s catabolic effect on protein me-tabolism during AA load, we studied {{the effects of}} glucagon on circulating AA and protein dynamics in six healthy sub-jects. Five protocols were performed in each subject using somatostatin to inhibit the secretion of insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone (GH) and selectively replacing these hormones in different protocols. Total AA concentration was the highest when glucagon, insulin, and GH were low. Selective increase of glucagon levels prevented this incre-ment in AA. Addition of high levels of insulin and GH to high glucagon {{had no effect on}} total AA levels, although branched chain AA levels declined. Glucagon mostly de-creased glucogenic AA and enhanced glucose production. Endogenous leucine flux, reflecting proteolysis, decreased while leucine oxidation increased in protocols where AA were infused and these changes were unaffected by the hor-mones. Nonoxidative leucine flux reflecting protein synthe-sis was stimulated by AA, but high glucagon attenuated this effect. Addition of GH and insulin partially reversed the in-hibitory effect of glucagon on protein synthesis. We con-clude that glucagon is the pivotal hormone in amino acid disposal during an AA load and, by reducing the <b>availability</b> of <b>AA,</b> glucagon inhibits protein synthesis stimulated by AA. These data provide further support for a catabolic role of glucagon at physiological concentrations. ...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} thesis was to investigate methods for improving the nutritional and physical quality of plant ingredients in diets for salmonids by use of thermomechanical treatment and supplemental organic acid salts. Diets containing plant ingredients derived from soybeans or barley were exposed to thermo-mechanical treatment at different temperatures by (1) expander pretreatment, (2) extrusion and (3) autoclaving, {{with or without the}} supplementation of 12 g kg- 1 potassium diformate (KDF) or 10. 6 g kg- 1 sodium diformate (NaDF). Nutritional quality was evaluated by the content of dietary AA, available lysine and trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA), as well as in vivo apparent digestibility in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and mink (Neovison vison). In addition, a two-step in vitro gastrointestinal model (GIM) was used to assess protein solubility and bioavailability of AA by use of digestive enzymes from Atlantic salmon. Physical quality of extruded diets was evaluated by measuring hardness, expansion ratio, durability and water stability index (WSI). Expander pretreatment of full-fat soybean meal (FFSBM) at 100 and 120 ºC improved (P 0. 1) affect nutrient digestibility in Atlantic salmon and mink, whereas supplementation of NaDF improved (P 0. 1) affect the digestibility of CP or individual AA in mink. Physical quality of the extruded diets was affected by both extrusion temperature and supplementation of organic acid salts. Increased pellet expansion was observed in diets with soybeans processed by expander pretreatment and increasing extrusion temperatures, while supplemental KDF reduced pellet expansion. In diets with BPC, increasing extrusion temperatures improved pellet durability. Addition of NaDF improved the expansion ratio, durability and WSI compared to diets without NaDF. The improved digestibility of plant proteins in salmonids by thermo-mechanical treatment at increasing temperatures is explained by a reduction in heat-labile ANF concurrent with higher <b>availability</b> of <b>AA,</b> as a result of denaturation and structural unfolding of protein molecules. The negative effects of increasing temperatures in combination with long treatment times in the autoclave on digestibility of CP and AA in mink was explained by a reduction in <b>AA</b> <b>availability.</b> Supplementation of acid salts did not consistently improve the digestibility of plant ingredients in salmonids and did not protect the protein from heat-induced damage during prolonged heat treatment. The lack of consistency remains unclear and requires further investigation. Both increasing temperatures during extrusion and supplementation of acid salts affected the physical quality of the feeds. The improved physical quality by supplemental acid salts indicates increased binding of feed particles...|$|R

Cerebral and spinal complications {{are the most}} feared and common complications of aortic arch surgery. With best available techniques for cerebral and spinal protection, anesthetic management and good post-operative care; aortic arch surgery is considerably safer nowadays and satisfactory results can be achieved in most patients. Also, selecting the sites for arterial cannulation to maintain whole body circulation, during isolation of the aortic arch to operate on it, need proper anatomical description {{of the extent of}} the aneurysm.

In {{this work}} we {{have studied the}} effect of caveolin- 1 {{deficiency}} on the mechanisms that regulate free Arachidonic acid (<b>AA)</b> <b>availability.</b> The results presented here demonstrate that macrophages from caveolin- 1 - deficient mice exhibit elevated fatty acid incorporation and remodeling and a constitutively increased CoA-independent transacylase activity. Mass spectrometrybased lipidomic analyses reveal stable alterations in the profile of AA distribution among phospholipids, manifested by reduced levels of AA in choline glycerophospholipids but elevated levels in ethanolamine glycerophospholipids and phosphatidylinositol. Furthermore, macrophages from caveolin- 1 null mice show decreased AA mobilization and prostaglandin E 2 and LTB 4 production upon cell stimulation. Collectively, these results {{provide insight into the}} role of caveolin- 1 in AA homeostasis and suggest an important role for this protein in the eicosanoid biosynthetic response.

40|$|The {{immune system}} is {{involved}} in host defense against infectious agents, tumor cells, and environmental insults. Inflammation {{is an important component}} of the early immunologic response. Inappropriate or dysfunctional immune responses underlie acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. The n- 6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) is the precursor of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and related compounds that have important roles in inflammation and in the regulation of immunity. Feeding fish oil results in partial replacement of AA in cell membranes by EPA. This leads to decreased production of AA-derived mediators, through several mechanisms, including decreased <b>availability</b> of <b>AA,</b> competition for cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes, and decreased expression of COX- 2 and 5 -LOX. This alone is a potentially beneficial anti-inflammatory effect of n- 3 FA. However, n- 3 FA have a number of other effects that might occur downstream of altered eicosanoid production or might be independent of this effect. For example, dietary fish oil results in suppressed production of proinflammatory cytokines and can modulate adhesion molecule expression. These effects occur at the level of altered gene expression. Fish oil feeding has been shown to ameliorate the symptoms of some animal models of autoimmune disease and to protect against the effects of endotoxin. Clinical studies have reported that oral fish oil supplementation has beneficial effects in rheumatoid arthritis and among some asthmatics, supporting the idea that the n- 3 FA in fish oil are anti-inflammatory. There are indications that the inclusion of fish oil in enteral and parenteral formulae is beneficial to patients...|$|R
30|$|It is well {{established}} that fetal growth is influenced by fetal amino acid (<b>AA)</b> <b>availability</b> (De Boo et al. 2005; Kwon et al. 2004; Liechty et al. 1999). Studies in sheep indicate {{that the rate of}} protein accretion in the fetus can be stimulated through the fetal infusion of a mix of AA (De Boo et al. 2005; Liechty et al. 1999). Importantly, AA also have the capacity to signal to metabolic pathways which regulate muscle growth (Brown et al. 2009; Hara et al. 1998) via changes in the intracellular concentration of specific AA (Beugnet et al. 2003; Christie et al. 2002; Sancak et al. 2008). For example, AA signalling {{plays an important role in}} the regulation of skeletal muscle hypertrophy in monogastrics, through the activation of specific cell signalling pathways (e.g. mechanistic target of rapamycin, mTOR), which controls protein synthesis (Tan et al. 2009; Yao et al. 2008). However, the potential for specific AA to act as signalling molecules to regulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy during gestation in ruminants is not well understood.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at {{examining}} the mechanism whereby an otherwise non-toxic concentration of peroxynitrite promotes a rapid necrotic response in U 937 cells in which cytosolic phospholipase A(2) is pharmacologically inhibited or genetically depleted. We found that loss of viable cells is appreciable 15 min after addition of peroxynitrite, does not further increase at 30 min and is mediated by mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Both MPT and toxicity were prevented by exogenous arachidonic acid (AA). Various experimental approaches produced results consistent {{with the notion that}} the AA-dependent protective mechanism takes place 10 - 15 min after addition of peroxynitrite. The observation that the extent of DNA strand scission induced by peroxynitrite did not vary under conditions of different <b>AA</b> <b>availability</b> suggests that this event is either upstream to mitochondrial dysfunction or irrelevant for cytotoxicity. Collectively, these data indicate that a non-toxic concentration of peroxynitrite commits U 937 cells to MTP-dependent necrosis that is however prevented by endogenous AA. Thus, mitochondria are a likely target of the cytoprotective signalling triggered by AA...|$|R
40|$|Ascorbic acid (AA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} water-soluble antioxidants in biological systems. It is believed to be essential for scavenging free radicals, thereby reducing the mutation rate of DNA and preventing the develop-ment of diseases associated with gene mutations (1). AA plays an integral role in the synthesis of connective tissue and reduces biochemical cofactors and substrates (1). Serum concentrations of <b>AA</b> reflect the <b>availability</b> of <b>AA</b> for biochemical processes in humans and investigated animals (1). Our laboratory has been studying the preci-sion and accuracy of serum AA concentration measure-ments performed by the medical research community (2). We have prepared several stable reference materials, as well as the stable Standard Reference Material (SRM) 970, Ascorbic Acid in Human Serum, for evaluating laboratory performance in the measurement of AA in human serum (2). We have distributed these materials in several inter-national collaborative studies. These studies indicated that the interlaboratory precision is poorer than expected (relative SD, 10 – 30 %). However, our laboratory studies on SRM 970 and other standard materials indicate that it is possible to routinely measure AA accurately with a high degree of precision (2). Recently, we observed a significant decrease in the concentration of AA in our calibration solutions during the course of several experiments. We now document that the inside surface of glassware may contain materials that measurably degrade AA within a short period of time (, 24 h). This is particularly true for autosampler vials used to hold samples for chromatography. This degrada-tion may also occur in tubes and vials used in the collection and processing of blood and serum samples. It may well be that this type of degradation accounts for a substantial amount of the observed interlaboratory vari-ation. We evaluated nine different lots of vials (12 3 32 mm) from five different suppliers (Varian Analytical Instru...|$|R
40|$|AbstractResponses of {{broilers}} to dietary {{amino acids}} (AA) have been extensively studied especially after their synthetic and crystalline forms became available. Synthetic (DL-Met and Met analogue) {{as well as}} crystalline (l-Lys and l-Thr) AA are now widely used in commercial production diets to reduce crude protein (CP) levels to allow competitive bird performance. In parallel, birds diets formulated without excess CP have reduced nitrogen excretion as well as lower costs. Diet composition affects the order of limiting AA after Thr and {{this has led to}} some debate on the feasibility of including the next limiting AA, which would be the fourth, in most of the scenarios. Using maize-soy type diets, the literature suggests that Val is the fourth AA limiting. As the commercial cost of l-Val is progressively reduced, concerns have been raised on the effectiveness of its supplementation to produce broiler responses that are similar compared with feed that does not contain this AA. Antagonisms between branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) {{have been reported in the}} past; however, their use in the current maize-soy diet commercial setting is unlikely. Formulation of diets with crystalline l-Val can potentially modify the ratio between BCAA as it is supplemented in diets that are further reduced in CP. Increased <b>availability</b> of <b>AA</b> can also be achieved when diets are supplemented with exogenous proteases; however, the resulting impact in the total profile of AA is different because a wider group of AA becomes simultaneously available when compared to diets receiving addition of synthetic/crystalline AA one by one. A scenario of CP reduction in diets seems clear with the increasing use of supplemental AA along with protease in broiler diets. The knowledge of CP reduction strategies, such as protease and synthetic AA supplementation, can be a valuable asset due to the competitive nature of broiler meat production business...|$|R
40|$|Eicosanoids {{are derived}} from the fatty acids {{that make up the}} cell {{membrane}} and nuclear membrane. They begin as a single poly unsaturated fatty acid, the arachidonic acid. (AA) is produced from membrane phospholipids and then it can be enzymatically metabolized through the cycloooxygenase pathway into different eicosanoids including prostaglandins. They have various roles in inflammation, and many diseases including asthma, and cystic fibrosis. Fibroblasts from nasal polyps of asthma patients have reduced expression of cyclooxygenase- 2 and production of prostaglandin (PG) E 2. It is hypothesized that the reported alterations are due to alterations in the <b>availability</b> of <b>AA.</b> So we aimed to determine the fatty acid composition of airway fibroblasts from healthy subjects and from asthma patients with and without aspirin intolerance. In patients with cystic fibrosis there is a relationship between prostanoid production and cystic fibrosis (CF) genotype severity, and also with the severity of the phenotype expression determined by {{the presence or absence of}} pancreatic insufficiency. We aimed to assess the relationship in patients with cystic fibrosis between prostanoid production and lung function values, pancreatic function as a measure of CF severity, and genotype severity. And to assess the relationship between PGE-M and PGD-M urinary metabolites of PGE(2) and PGD(2) and CF severity. Since eicosanoids and their precursor AA have a crucial role in physiology and pathology, it is very important to identify and quantify the amount that is produced by the cells and tissues in order to identify better the targets for pharmaceutical intervention. They need a special method for isolating them and a specific and sensitive instrument for identifying, and quantifying them. Gas chromatography was used for the analysis of fatty acids in human nasal fibroblasts culture, and the high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used for the identification and quantification of prostaglandins metabolites (Tetranor-PGEM and Tetranor-PGDM) in human urine...|$|R
40|$|Essential {{amino acids}} (EAA) stimulate {{skeletal}} muscle mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC 1) signaling and protein synthesis. It {{has recently been}} reported that an increase in amino acid (AA) transporter expression during anabolic conditions is rapamycin-sensitive. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether an increase in EAA <b>availability</b> increases <b>AA</b> transporter expression in human skeletal muscle. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis of seven young adult subjects (3 male, 4 female) before and 1 – 3 h after EAA ingestion (10 g). Blood and muscle samples were analyzed for leucine kinetics using stable isotopic techniques. Quantitative RT-PCR, and immunoblotting were used to determine the mRNA and protein expression, respectively, of AA transporters and members of the general AA control pathway [general control nonrepressed (GCN 2), activating transcription factor (ATF 4), and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF 2) α-subunit (Ser 52) ]. EAA ingestion increased blood leucine concentration, delivery of leucine to muscle, transport of leucine from blood into muscle, intracellular muscle leucine concentration, ribosomal protein S 6 (Ser 240 / 244) phosphorylation, and muscle protein synthesis. This was followed with increased L-type AA transporter (LAT 1), CD 98, sodium-coupled neutral AA transporter (SNAT 2), and proton-coupled amino acid transporter (PAT 1) mRNA expression at 1 h (P < 0. 05) and modest increases in LAT 1 protein expression (3 h post-EAA) and SNAT 2 protein expression (2 and 3 h post-EAA, P < 0. 05). Although there were no changes in GCN 2 expression and eIF 2 α phosphorylation, ATF 4 protein expression reached significance by 2 h post-EAA (P < 0. 05). We conclude that an increase in EAA availability upregulates human skeletal muscle AA transporter expression, perhaps in an mTORC 1 -dependent manner, which may be an adaptive response necessary for improved AA intracellular delivery...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the omega- 6 fatty acids increase the rate of tumor growth. Here we test that hypothesis in the PC- 3 human prostate tumor. We found that the essential fatty acids, linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA), and the AA metabolite PGE(2) stimulate tumor growth while oleic acid (OA) and the omega- 3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) inhibited growth. In examining the role of AA in growth response, we extended our studies to analyze changes in early gene expression induced by AA. We demonstrate that c-fos expression is increased within minutes of addition in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the immediate early gene cox- 2 is also increased {{in the presence of}} AA in a dose-dependent manner, while the constitutive cox- 1 message was not increased. Three hours after exposure to AA, the synthesis of PGE(2) via COX- 2 was also increased. Previous studies have demonstrated that AA was primarily delivered by low density lipoprotein (LDL) via its receptor (LDLr). Since it is known that hepatomas, acute myelogenous leukemia and colorectal tumors lack normal cholesterol feedback, we examined the role of the LDLr in growth regulation of the PC- 3 prostate cancer cells. Analysis of ldlr mRNA expression and LDLr function demonstrated that human PC- 3 prostate cancer cells lack normal feedback regulation. While exogenous LDL caused a significant stimulation of cell growth and PGE(2) synthesis, no change was seen in regulation of the LDLr by LDL. Taken together, these data show that normal cholesterol feedback of ldlr message and protein is lost in prostate cancer. These data suggest that unregulated over-expression of LDLr in tumor cells would permit increased <b>availability</b> of <b>AA,</b> which induces immediate early genes c-fos and cox- 2 within minutes of uptake...|$|R
