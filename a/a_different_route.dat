5|$|A bulker's voyages are {{determined}} by market forces; routes and cargoes often vary. A ship may engage in the grain trade during the harvest season and later move on to carry other cargoes or work on <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route.</b> Aboard a coastal carrier in the tramp trade, the crew will often not know the {{next port of call}} until the cargo is fully loaded.|$|E
5|$|On 23 May 1937, a {{group of}} four climbers descended the face on <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route</b> {{and were able to}} find a golden ring and a golden watch, which they sent to the airline. The found some body parts which they offered to recover for 500 Norwegian krone, but this was rejected. Heggenes stated that these were parts which had been buried by the {{previous}} expedition.|$|E
5|$|Route X53 took <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route</b> between Burnley and Rawtenstall, via Water and Waterfoot in {{the upper}} Irwell Valley. In the early 1960s these {{journeys}} were 4-hourly and started/ended at Burnley. By the 1970s frequency had declined to a southbound morning and northbound evening peak working, but it survived to be renumbered 753 when X43 became 743. It was withdrawn along with the 743.|$|E

5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route</b> was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E
5|$|Churches {{managed to}} {{convince}} {{the commander of the}} brigade to conduct an operation to free the rest of the work party the following day, by giving him crucial information regarding the work site and the guards. Next morning Churches and Laws returned with some hundred Partisans to await the arrival of the work party by the usual train. As soon as work had begun the Partisans disarmed the eight guards and captured the four civilian overseers. In a short time the POWs, guards, and civilian overseers were being escorted south along <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route</b> than that used by the first seven escapees the previous afternoon.|$|E
5|$|In November 1901 the B {{published}} {{details of}} its {{bill for the}} 1902 session. The extension to The Angel was dropped, and <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route</b> eastwards from Piccadilly Circus was planned. Once again this ran to Cranbourn Street, but it continued under Long Acre and Great Queen Street to meet and connect to the GN's tunnels at Little Queen Street (now {{the northern part of}} Kingsway) just south of the GN's planned Holborn station. The B planned stations at Wardour Street, Cranbourn Street and Covent Garden.|$|E

5|$|Tack's {{column was}} {{reinforced}} by the garrison of Semarang and marched southward to the Pajang district, where it fought the followers of Trunajaya's ally Raden Kajoran. Hurdt and Amangkurat's column re-assembled in Godong on the Serang River and stayed there for six days. Their artillery and supplies were brought there by river, but now had to join the southward march overland through enemy territory. This column then joined Tack's column in the Solo River valley (the river was then called the Semanggi River). Meanwhile, van Renesse and Mulder's column passed Pati, was joined by the VOC troops there, and marched through <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route</b> towards Kediri.|$|E
5|$|The {{first route}} through {{this portion of}} Utah was the Old Spanish Trail, a trade route between Santa Fe, New Mexico and Los Angeles, California. The trail was in common use before the Mexican-American War in 1848. Although the trail serves <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route</b> than I-70, they were both {{intended}} to connect southern California with points further east. I-70 generally parallels {{the route of the}} Old Spanish Trail west of Crescent Junction. I-15 south of the junction with I-70 also generally parallels the trail.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, a Macedonian {{fleet of}} 38 vessels was sent across by Philip V, while the larger {{warships}} sailed around Cape Malea. After his victory at Actium in 31BC, Octavian advanced {{as fast as}} possible against Marc Antony by ordering part of his 260 Liburnians to be carried over the Isthmus. In 868AD, the Byzantine admiral Niketas Oryphas had his whole fleet of one hundred dromons dragged across the Isthmus in a quickly executed operation, but this took place most likely on <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of his trap-shooting career, Bain {{developed}} an appreciation for nature. He bought an ownership share of the Portage Country Club, on the Delta Marsh near the south shore of Lake Manitoba, and later donated the land to Ducks Unlimited. Bain built the Mallard Lodge as a personal retreat on land adjacent to the club. He strictly enforced his privacy, even building a road to his lodge that he allowed no one else to use; members of the Portage Country Club were required to take <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route.</b> Bain intended to donate his lodge to the government of Manitoba for preservation, though he died before he could do so. The lodge passed into the control of the government regardless, and was donated to the University of Manitoba as a research facility in 1966 that remains active today. Bain was {{also a member of the}} Manitoba Game and Fish Association and the Winnipeg Humane Society.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{planning}} {{in the late}} 1980s for High Speed 1, British Rail considered building the line to serve a low-level station at King's Cross via south London. An option for this route was via Herne Hill, which would have required quadrupling the tracks on the Chatham Main Line between Shortlands and Herne Hill and on the City Branch to Loughborough Junction; {{it was estimated that}} this would have led to the loss of 90â€“180 homes in Lambeth. Although both <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route</b> and London terminus for HS1 were eventually chosen (St Pancras via East London), Eurostar services linking London Waterloo to Brussels and Paris passed through Herne Hill without stopping from 1994 until the completion of HS1 in November 2007. This marked the end of rail services to the continent via Herne Hill, which had been started by the LCDR in 1863 when the line between Victoria and Dover via Herne Hill was completed.|$|E
5|$|One of Metternich's first tasks was to {{push for}} the {{marriage}} of Napoleon to Archduchess Marie Louise {{rather than to the}} Tsar's youngest sister Anna Pavlovna. Metternich would later seek to distance himself from the marriage by claiming it was Napoleon's own idea, but this is improbable; in any case, he was happy to claim responsibility at the time. By 7 February Napoleon had agreed and the pair were married by proxy on 11 March. Marie Louise left for France soon after and Metternich followed by <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route</b> and unofficially. The trip was designed, Metternich explained, to transport his family (stranded in France by the outbreak of war) home and to report to the Austrian Emperor about Marie Louise's activities.|$|E

50|$|When the Stage Coach {{was used}} as a form of {{transport}} in Ireland, this road took <b>a</b> slightly <b>different</b> <b>route</b> to include the area that is now known as Enfield. The road between Dublin and Mullingar running through Enfield was built in 1735.|$|R
5|$|Suddenly, Kabandha {{appeared}} before them. The demon blocked {{the path of}} the brothers, who tried to escape by taking <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route,</b> but were finally caught by Kabandha. The demon grabbed Rama in his right arm and Lakshmana in his left. Finding themselves helpless in Kabandha's clutches, Lakshmana appeals to Rama to escape and find Sita, leaving him behind as a sacrifice to the demon. Rama consoled him. Kabandha declared that he was extremely hungry and asked them who they were who had come to sate his hunger. At this time, Lakshmana realized that the strength of the demon lay in his hands and suggested that they cut off the demon's hands. Annoyed by the brothers' conversation, Kabandha decided to eat them at once and drew them closer to his mouth. The brothers drew their swords and quickly cut off the arms of the demon, who fell down with a mighty roar.|$|E
5|$|The A1 {{motorway}} {{was originally}} {{designed in the}} early 1970s, albeit along <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route</b> than the present Zagrebâ€“Split motorway route. After suppression of the Croatian Spring and removal of the Croatian leadership that proposed and adopted the construction plan in 1971, all the work related to the Zagrebâ€“Split motorway was cancelled. The plans were revived in the 1990s and new designs were developed to include a motorway section built between Zagreb and Karlovac into the design so that the section could be shared between Zagrebâ€“Split and Zagrebâ€“Rijeka motorways. Construction work started in 2000 and the motorway reached Split by 2005 and was extended towards Dubrovnik later on. Both in the 1970s and in the 2000s, construction of the Zagrebâ€“Split motorway was perceived to symbolize rebuilding of national unity.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans were}} sent from the {{ministry}} to the municipality, whose council passed the plans on 12 November 1908. Among the conditions were that within five years, the municipality could {{demand that the}} line be extended to either Ljabru or Ljan. The concession was again considered on 2 November 1911, {{and there it was}} decided that the concession would be removed if the line was not finished by the end of 1914. However, in November 1911, Oslo City Council postponed their permissions while the issue was again made subject to reports on the issue. The report suggested <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route,</b> which ran via Lodalen and up Ekebergsletta at Ekeberg hovedgÃ¥rd. After negotiations, the city agreed to allow the line to follow Kongsveien.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, {{when the}} U.S. Highway system was first announced, {{there was a}} gap in US-50 between Ely and Thistle. At the time the states of Utah and Nevada were feuding about which of the old auto trails would be paved and used for the new U.S. Highway System. Nevada favored the Lincoln Highway, which the modern US-50 closely follows in that state. Utah refused to {{consider}} the Lincoln Highway west of Salt Lake City. Officials perceived that route would carry all California bound traffic directly to Nevada while passing through very few communities in Utah. Utah instead favored the Victory Highway (modern Interstate 80 west of Salt Lake) and the Arrowhead Trail (modern Interstate 15). By favoring these routes Utah could force travelers destined for southern California to use <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route</b> than those destined for northern California, with both of these traversing through more cities in Utah than the Lincoln Highway. The Arrowhead trail was especially beneficial to Utah as it passed through many communities in the state, but only Las Vegas in Nevada.|$|E
5|$|In October 2015, {{the city}} of Buenos Aires {{together}} with the Inter-American Development Bank presented a 150-page plan for the Underground called the Strategic and Technical Plan for the Expansion of the Subterranean Network (Plan EstratÃ©gico y TÃ©cnico para la ExpansiÃ³n de la Red de Subtes, or PETERS), highlighting past expansion efforts {{and the need to}} adapt plans to the current needs of the city. In this version of the Underground, Line I is cancelled while Line G takes <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route</b> through the centre of the city terminating at Constitucion railway station after going through the neighbourhood of San Telmo, rather than at Retiro railway station. Other changes include a Retiro Norte node where lines F and H terminate, rather than at Plaza Italia and Retiro respectively, while Line E is extended to Plaza Italia from Retiro â€“ a segment which in the original plan was part of Line F. In these plans, Line C is extended both northwards in a loop to Retiro bus station and southwards to the Buenos Aires Belgrano Sur Line railway station minor terminal.|$|E
5|$|Vann {{wanted to}} use a C-47 flare plane to {{illuminate}} the rice fields on the eastern flank of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi. He wanted to hit the Viet Cong with 500 rounds of artillery and destroy them as they retreated. Cao would not approve the use of flares because it could expose the airborne battalion's night defensive positions, and instead ordered 100 rounds of artillery to be fired {{at a rate of}} four shells per hour. At 22:00, Viet Cong commander Hoang led his two companies out of Ap Tan Thoi and headed for their base camp in the Plain of Reeds, while the local force units left by <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>route</b> for their hideouts in the local area. The 1st Company, 261st Battalion, led the column, followed by litter carriers carrying the dead and wounded. The 1st Company, 514th Battalion, covered the tail of the formation, with one of their platoons acting as a rear guard. The wounded Viet Cong soldiers were transferred onto sampans at the canal {{on the east side of}} Ap Tan Thoi, while the rest of the formation marched on. At 07:00 on 3 January, Hoang's men successfully reached their destination without being detected.|$|E
