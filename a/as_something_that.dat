5|$|Being an idealist, Kanō had broad {{aims for}} judo, which he saw <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{simultaneously}} encompassed self-defense, physical culture, and moral behavior.|$|E
5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E
25|$|Clinton {{also brought}} {{a message of}} {{departmental}} reform to the position, especially in regarding foreign aid programs <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> deserves the same status and level of scrutiny as diplomatic initiatives.|$|E
5000|$|A {{review of}} the song by Ultimate Classic Rock gave it a rating of {{two and a half}} out of five stars, and, while praising Joe Elliott's vocals, said that [...] "while it's not a bad song, the whole thing just comes across <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that's</b> been done before." ...|$|R

25|$|Economist Bryan Caplan {{has noted}} that Mises {{has been criticized for}} overstating the {{strength}} of his case in describing socialism as impossible rather than <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> would need to establish non-market institutions to deal with the inefficiency.|$|E
25|$|Ian Gordon {{suggests}} that the many incarnations of Superman across media use nostalgia to link the character to an ideology of the American Way. He defines this ideology {{as a means of}} associating individualism, consumerism, and democracy and <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> took shape around WWII and underpinned the war effort. Superman he notes was very much part of that effort.|$|E
25|$|Croatia had to {{extradite}} {{several of its}} citizens to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), a United Nations body, an issue that was often contentious in domestic politics. Croatia's relations with the ICTY had continually been cited by the EU officials <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> required further improvement. Ratification of the EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia had been stalled because of this.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2012 {{video game}} Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, {{one of the}} main protagonists {{mentions}} Dulce <b>as</b> containing <b>something</b> <b>that</b> would surprise the Russian government.|$|R
50|$|Platner {{outlined}} {{the definition of}} a ‘classic’ <b>as</b> being, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> every time you look at it, you accept it as it is and you see no way of improving it.|$|R

25|$|James and Schiller both treat truth <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{happens to}} a statement, and so James would agree that it only becomes true that the 100th decimal of Pi is 9 when someone in fact {{believes}} that statement and it leads them to their goals, but nowhere does James imply that meaning is something that {{happens to a}} statement. That is a unique element of Schiller's pragmatism.|$|E
25|$|Klingons see {{something}} that isn't growing <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is dying. A Klingon fights not for sport but to gain an advantage for the Empire, for his family and for himself. There {{is a sense of}} paranoia, as others are constantly watching all one's activities in order to seek advancement. This leads to a morality that Federation races see as often cruel and remorseless.|$|E
25|$|Several {{influential}} {{people of}} the time, including Bell, viewed deafness <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> should be eradicated, and also believed that with resources and effort, they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of sign language, thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded. Owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language, Bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing Deaf culture.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is iron--it is chain-armour," [...] {{he said at}} once. He was {{prepared}} for the surprise and the question, and he spoke quietly, <b>as</b> of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> he was not hurried to explain.|$|R

25|$|Michael Herzfeld, an anthropologist, {{argued that}} the idea of women losing their {{chastity}} derived from those who wished to explain a woman's new role within society. The idea of women expanding their roles outside of the home in society went against the ideas and morals that were upheld centuries before. In order to defend this morality, many highlighted the customs of the past <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> should have been continuously practiced and enforced even in a new modern era.|$|E
25|$|While {{thinking}} of {{an approach that}} would appeal to an audience outside of rock music, and wondering {{about the nature of}} pop music, Yamaguchi thought of the music of German composer Johann Sebastian Bach <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> transcended time and genre. Yamaguchi wrote the song as a documentary of the specific feelings that he had when listening to Bach at night time. He wrote the song as a love song, inspired by everyday things. The imagery in the song was inspired by music interacting with the brain of someone falling asleep, creating mixed-up dreams.|$|E
25|$|Eva Funke {{analyses}} {{the description}} of the Inca state as a utopian bourgeois society in the third volume as a critique of Campe’s contemporary society. Thus {{the description of}} the ruling system, for instance, functions as a mirror to the current systems of the German states and shows a utopian ideal where the bourgeois characteristic of competence is more important than birth. In addition, Funke points to the recurring motif of revolution in Discovery. The trilogy is presenting revolutions <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> needs to be avoided because they can hinder achieving one’s goals and are responsible for the downfall of peoples.|$|E

50|$|Tinware is any item made of {{prefabricated}} tinplate. Usually tinware {{refers to}} kitchenware made of tinplate, often crafted by tinsmiths. Many cans used for canned food are tinware <b>as</b> well. <b>Something</b> <b>that</b> is tinned after being shaped and fabricated {{is not considered}} tinware.|$|R
60|$|Clara did {{not care}} to ask any {{questions}} <b>as</b> to this <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was to be told, and therefore took her leave and went away.|$|R
25|$|Roosevelt saw the Economic Bill of Rights <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> would, {{at least}} initially, be {{implemented}} by legislation, {{but that did}} not exclude either the US Supreme Court's development of constitutional jurisprudence or amendments to the US Constitution. Roosevelt's model assumed that federal government would take the lead, {{but that did not}} prevent states improving their own legislative or constitutional framework beyond the federal minimum. Much of the groundwork had been laid before and during the New Deal but left many of the Second Bill of Rights' aspirations incomplete. Internationally, the same economic and social rights were written into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the notion}} of Satya, or Truth, {{is central to the}} Gandhian {{conception}} of nonviolence. Gandhi saw Truth <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is multifaceted and unable to be grasped in its entirety by any one individual. All carry pieces of the Truth, he believed, but all need the pieces of others’ truths in order to pursue the greater Truth. This led him to believe in the inherent worth of dialogue with opponents, in order to understand motivations. On a practical level, the willingness to listen to another's point of view is largely dependent on reciprocity. In order to be heard by one's opponents, one must also be prepared to listen.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, the Eastern Orthodox Church {{has always}} {{recognized}} the gradual {{development in the}} complexity of the articulation of the Church's teachings. It does not, however, believe that truth changes and therefore always supports its previous beliefs {{all the way back to}} what it holds to be the direct teachings from the Apostles. The Church also understands that not everything is perfectly clear; therefore, it has always accepted a fair amount of contention about certain issues, arguments about certain points, <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> will always be present within the Church. It is this contention which, through time, clarifies the truth. The Church sees this as the action of the Holy Spirit on history to manifest truth to man.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2001, the National Public Radio program All Things Considered noted that, in {{the wake}} of Gale's death, MIT had {{investigated}} how to deal with issues of student suicides. The student Eric Plosky commented to NPR, [...] "In many ways, suicide has been looked on <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that's</b> just part and parcel of life at the institute. That ingrained thinking historically, I think, has prevented administrators from looking at suicide as a problem to which there might be some reasonable response."The investigative report released by MIT identified deficiencies within its mental health program. MIT has noted that its suicide rate is comparable to that of other major universities.|$|R
5000|$|The {{world of}} {{everyday}} life cannot ever be taken <b>as</b> <b>something</b> personal <b>that</b> has power over us, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> could make us, or destroy us, because man’s battlefield is not in his strife with the world around him. His battlefield is over the horizon, in an area which is unthinkable for an average man, the area where man ceases to be a man.” ~Author’s Commentary to 30th Anniversary Edition of The Teachings of don Juan ...|$|R

25|$|According to the World Health Organization, {{malnutrition}} is {{the biggest}} contributor to child mortality, present in half of all cases. Six million children die of hunger every year. Underweight births and intrauterine growth restrictions cause 2.2 million child deaths a year. Poor or non-existent breastfeeding causes another 1.4 million. Other deficiencies, such as lack of vitamin A or zinc, for example, account for 1 million. Malnutrition {{in the first two}} years is irreversible. Malnourished children grow up with worse health and lower education achievement. Their own children tend to be smaller. Malnutrition was previously seen <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> exacerbates the problems of diseases such as measles, pneumonia and diarrhea, but malnutrition actually causes diseases, and can be fatal in its own right.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of tobacco to soldiers was early on recognized <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{could not be}} ignored by commanders. By the 17th century allowances of tobacco were a standard part of the naval rations of many nations and by World War I cigarette manufacturers and governments collaborated in securing tobacco and cigarette allowances to soldiers in the field. It was asserted that regular use of tobacco while under duress would not only calm the soldiers but allow them to withstand greater hardship. Until the mid-20th century, {{the majority of the}} adult population in many Western nations were smokers and the claims of anti-smoking activists were met with much skepticism, if not outright contempt. Today the movement has considerably more weight and evidence of its claims, but a considerable proportion of the population remains steadfast smokers.|$|E
25|$|Although {{in general}} the Romans {{regarded}} marriage as a male-female union {{for the purpose of}} producing children, a few scholars believe that in the early Imperial period some male couples were celebrating traditional marriage rites in the presence of friends. Male-male weddings are reported by sources that mock them; the feelings of the participants are not recorded. Both Martial and Juvenal refer to marriage between males <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> occurs not infrequently, although they disapprove of it. Roman law did not recognize marriage between males, but one of the grounds for disapproval expressed in Juvenal's satire is that celebrating the rites would lead to expectations for such marriages to be registered officially. As the empire was becoming Christianized in the 4th century, legal prohibitions against marriage between males began to appear.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{shall be}} put in better trim ere the English pock-puddings see him,' said Douglas, looking at him, perhaps for the first time, <b>as</b> <b>something</b> unsuited to <b>that</b> orderly company.|$|R

50|$|Two men {{are about}} to watch a movie on their DVD player, {{but one of them}} selects the {{language}} in a different country causing the background to change into a setting from the country and the other guy to dress up <b>as</b> <b>something</b> from <b>that</b> particular country.
