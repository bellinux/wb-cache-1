500|$|In {{the wake}} of the Second Intifada, the Palestinian {{uprising}} against Israeli occupation that began in 2000, the show became dominated by the conflict, which Qandil generally regarded as a campaign of Israeli aggression. He frequently broadcast the Israeli military's actions during the Intifada and called for viewers to support the uprising and boycott Israeli products. Qandil responded to a query regarding his extensive coverage of the Intifada by saying, [...] "How are news shows expected to react to events such as the Intifada? <b>Are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> to keep silent?" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{he saw the}} {{completed}} episode, James L. Brooks called the writers and suggested that the Kamp Krusty script {{be used as a}} plotline for a film. However, the episode ran very short, and to make it barely fit the minimum time the Kamp Krusty song had to be lengthened by a number of verses. The episode was also chosen to be the first episode of the season, further complicating matters. As Jean told Brooks, [...] "First of all, if we make it into the movie then we don't have a premiere, and second, if we can't make 18 minutes out of this episode how <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> to make 80?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] and [...] "Kamp Krusty" [...] were holdovers {{from the}} {{previous}} season and so were {{the last of the}} Klasky Csupo produced episodes to air. Brooks suggested that the script for [...] "Kamp Krusty" [...] be expanded and produced as a feature-length theatrically released film. However, the episode ran very short, barely reaching the minimum length allowed, with the episode's musical number having to be lengthened by a number of verses. The episode had also been selected to be the season's premiere. As Jean told Brooks, [...] "First of all, if we make it into the movie then we don't have a premiere, and second if we can't make 18 minutes out of this episode how <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> to make 80?" ...|$|E

500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} [...] "B–" [...] and {{concluded}} that, [...] "I did jump a few times, and I liked Haley's dour malevolence, but overall, the new Nightmare on Elm Street is a by-the-numbers bad dream that plays {{a little too much}} like a corporately ordered rerun. One, two, Freddy's coming for you. Three, four, we've been there before". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the acting calling it [...] "lethargically lifeless" [...] and criticized Haley's portrayal of Krueger, saying, [...] "Even with his electronically deepened voice and a pointless amount of backstory, there's just no replacing Englund". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1 star out of 4, writing in his review, [...] "I stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what? <b>Are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> to be scared? Is the sudden clanging chord supposed to evoke a fearful Pavlovian response?".|$|E

Sam mark 1 and Sam mark 2 were very different, and Sam mark 1 rebooted {{seems to be a}} third person altogether. Is she a canny businesswoman or completely thick?

When an interviewer asked about {{a situation in which}} the government might use rubber bullets, which are designed to incapacitate and not kill, Shaw responded, [...] "How <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> to know that they're firing rubber bullets when it has been fired?” During an appearance on The O'Reilly Factor, host Bill O'Reilly asked Shaw what made Cliven Bundy different from Occupy Wall Street supporters. Shaw replied that Cliven Bundy is [...] "providing the country with beef" [...] and that the two groups have different methods of dissent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{novel that}} made its author [...] "the true lion of the Russian literature" [...] (according to Ivan Goncharov) enjoyed great {{success with the}} reading public upon its {{publication}} and spawned dozens of reviews and analytical essays, some of which (by Dmitry Pisarev, Pavel Annenkov, Dragomirov and Strakhov) {{formed the basis for}} the research of later Tolstoy scholars. Yet the Russian press's initial response to the novel was muted, most critics unable to decide how to classify it. The liberal newspaper Golos (The Voice, April 3, #93, 1865) {{was one of the first}} to react. Its anonymous reviewer posed a question later repeated by many others: [...] "What could this possibly be? What kind of genre <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> to file it to?..
