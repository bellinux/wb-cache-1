For example, in the tropical rainforests of Panama, swarms of army ants attract many species of birds to this feast of scrambling insects, spiders, scorpions, worms, and other animals. Some of these birds are named “antbirds” due to this tendency. While focused on feeding on these invertebrates, birds at army-ant swarms typically allow very close approach by people—within 1 or 2 meters in many cases—often providing the best opportunities to see many of these species. Depending {{on the size of}} the ant swarm and the amount of prey the ants stir up, birds can number from a few to dozens of individuals. Birds that frequent army-ant swarms include the white-whiskered puffbird, rufous motmot, rufous-vented ground cuckoo, gray-necked wood rail, plain-brown woodcreeper, northern barred woodcreeper, cocoa woodcreeper, black-striped woodcreeper, fasciated antshrike, black-crowned antshrike, spotted antbird, bicolored antbird, ocellated antbird, chestnut-backed antbird, black-faced <b>antthrush,</b> and gray-headed tanager.|$|E
50|$|The cryptic <b>antthrush</b> (Chamaeza meruloides), {{also known}} as the Such's <b>antthrush,</b> is a species of bird in the Formicariidae family. It is endemic to Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil. Although first {{described}} almost 200 years ago, it was long overlooked (hence, cryptic) due to confusion with the rufous-tailed <b>antthrush</b> and short-tailed <b>antthrush,</b> which inhabit the same region. The cryptic <b>antthrush</b> is mainly found at altitudes above the short-tailed <b>antthrush,</b> but below the rufous-tailed <b>antthrush.</b> When Nicholas Aylward Vigors described this species in 1825, he based it on two specimens collected by George Such, and this is the reason for the other common name, Such's <b>antthrush.</b>|$|E
50|$|The rufous-tailed <b>antthrush</b> or Brazilian <b>antthrush</b> (Chamaeza ruficauda) is {{a species}} of bird in the Formicariidae family. It is endemic to the Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil and far northeastern Argentina (only Misiones Province). The cryptic <b>antthrush</b> and short-tailed <b>antthrush</b> {{are present in the}} same region, but these are mainly found at lower altitudes than the rufous-tailed <b>antthrush.</b>|$|E

5|$|Thamnophilidae {{was removed}} from Formicariidae, leaving behind the <b>antthrushes</b> and antpittas, due to {{recognition}} of differences {{in the structure of}} the breastbone (sternum) and syrinx, and Sibley and Ahlquist's examination of DNA–DNA hybridization. The Thamnophilidae antbirds are members of the infraorder Tyrannides (or tracheophone suboscines), one of two infraorders in the suborder Tyranni. The Thamnophilidae are now thought to occupy a fairly basal position within the infraorder, i. e. with regard to their relatives the <b>antthrushes</b> and antpittas, tapaculos, gnateaters, and also the ovenbirds. The sister group of the Thamnophilidae is thought to be the gnateaters. The ovenbirds, tapaculos, <b>antthrushes</b> and antpittas are thought to represent a different radiation of that early split.|$|R
50|$|The Schwartz's <b>antthrush</b> (Chamaeza turdina), {{also known}} as the {{scalloped}} <b>antthrush,</b> is a species of bird in the Formicariidae family. It is found in humid highland forests in the Andes of Colombia and the Coastal Range in Venezuela. The Colombian population belongs to the nominate subspecies, while the Venezuelan belongs to chionogaster. Long included as a subspecies of the rufous-tailed <b>antthrush,</b> it was only recognized as a separate species in 1992. It takes its name from ornithologist Paul A. Schwartz, who was the first to realize how strikingly different its song sounds compared to that of the rufous-tailed <b>antthrush.</b> The song of Schwartz's <b>antthrush</b> is closer to that of the cryptic <b>antthrush.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Antthrushes</b> (Formicarius, Chamaeza) {{sometimes}} {{walk around}} swarms of army ants and capture ground prey, {{but do not}} follow ants regularly. Among antpittas, only fast-leaping Pittasoma michleri and P. rufopileatum regularly follow ants. Gnateaters (Conopophaga) follow ants little. All these ground-foraging genera are poorly adapted for rapid flying, and failure to follow ants is perhaps due to inability to evade predators or out fly competitors near groups of birds attracted by ants...|$|R
5|$|The antbirds {{are a large}} {{passerine}} bird family, Thamnophilidae, found across subtropical {{and tropical}} Central and South America, from Mexico to Argentina. There are more than 200 species, known variously as antshrikes, antwrens, antvireos, fire-eyes, bare-eyes and bushbirds. They {{are related to the}} <b>antthrushes</b> and antpittas (family Formicariidae), the tapaculos, the gnateaters and the ovenbirds. Despite some species' common names, this family is not closely related to the wrens, vireos or shrikes.|$|R
50|$|Very little {{molecular}} data is currently available for rhinocryptids, which are moreover rather non-diagnostic morphologically. As relationships with related {{groups such as}} ovenbirds have not been fully resolved, {{it is certain that}} the systematics of the group will be revised soon, {{but it is not clear}} how exactly the new systematic lineup will be. On the other hand, morphological, behavioral and molecular analyses of the true antpittas agree astoundingly well as regards their internal systematics, considering the high amount of lifestyle-related homoplasies in the birds discussed here.Recent taxonomic favor has moved three major lineages - <b>antthrushes,</b> tapaculos and allies, and antpittas into separate families.|$|R
50|$|The rufous-fronted <b>antthrush</b> (Formicarius rufifrons) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Formicariidae. It is found very locally in humid forest in southeastern Peru, northwestern Bolivia (Pando), and far southwestern Brazil (Acre). It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss.|$|E

50|$|The <b>antthrush</b> {{builds a}} leaf-lined nest in a cavity in a hollow branch or stump {{in which two}} white eggs are laid. It is an {{insectivore}} which feeds on ants and other insects. It is quite terrestrial, feeding mainly on the ground. It will follow columns of army ants. The call is a loud whistle followed {{by a series of}} 2 - 10 descending whistles, WHU! wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu.|$|E
5000|$|Whether {{this latter}} approach, the {{placement}} as a tribe in a tapaculo-antthrush Formicariinae subfamily, or maintenance {{as a separate}} family is to be preferred depends on whether the true antpittas are closer to the tapaculos and true antbirds, or rather to the Pittasoma [...] "gnatthrushes" [...] and other gnateaters and the true antbirds. There are some, albeit very tentative, indications that the latter may indeed be the case, which would {{be reflected in the}} placement of the tapaculos as subfamily Rhinocryptinae, with the Formicariinae being restricted to the true <b>antthrushes</b> (Rice 2005a). Today, the tapaculos continue in the Rhinocryptidae until the systematics can be further defined.|$|R
5000|$|Recent {{research}} (Irestedt et al. 2002, Rice 2005a,b) {{indicates that}} the Formicariidae as previously delimited are highly paraphyletic, judging from comparison of several mt and nDNA sequences. The aberrant bar-bellied [...] "antpittas" [...] of the genus Pittasoma, which were formerly placed here, belong to the gnateater family (which initially was also {{considered part of the}} Formicariidae); as the gnateaters proper, they are sexually dichromatic. In addition, the true antpittas formerly placed in this family are now found in their own family, the Grallariidae. On the other hand, at least {{a large proportion of the}} Rhinocryptidae (tapaculos), including the type genus Rhinocrypta, seem to be closer to the <b>antthrushes,</b> but are still considered a distinct family.|$|R
50|$|The short-tailed <b>antthrush</b> (Chamaeza campanisona) is a South American {{species of}} {{bird in the}} family Formicariidae. Its {{distribution}} is highly disjunct with populations in the Atlantic Forest in eastern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and northeastern Argentina, isolated highland forests in northeastern Brazil, forests on the tepuis in southern Venezuela, Guyana and northern Brazil, and in forests along the east Andean slope from Venezuela to Bolivia.|$|E
50|$|The black-faced <b>antthrush</b> {{is similar}} in general {{appearance}} to a rail, with a dumpy body, horizontal carriage, stout bill and short cocked tail. It walks rather than hops, with a jerky motion again reminiscent of a rail. It is typically 18 - 19 cm long, and weighs 59 g. The upperparts are rufous brown, and the underparts are paler brown, except for the black face and throat, and rufous under the tail and behind the eye. The sexes are alike in plumage.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the famous}} guanacaste tree, this {{national}} park {{is also home}} to other tree species such as the rain tree, mamey sapote, Brazilian firetree, and Honduras mahogany, Belize's national tree. Belize's reputation for an extensive biodiversity is also evident in the park's wide range of animals that tourists are able to observe. These include the white-tailed deer, jaguarundi, kinkajou, nine-banded armadillo, among countless others. This park is also a favorite for birdwatching. There have been recorded over one hundred different bird species, including the Lesson's motmot and black-faced <b>antthrush.</b> Other birds seen at Guanacaste Park include the smoky-brown woodpecker, black-headed trogon, red-lored amazon, the magnolia warbler, belted kingfisher, and the bright-rumped attila.|$|E

In this work, we implement both two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) AML-based source localiza-tion algorithms. The 2 D algorithm is used to local-ize marmot alarm-calls of marmots on the meadow ground. The 3 D algorithm is used to localize the song of Acorn Woodpecker and Mexican <b>Antthrush</b> birds situated above the ground.
