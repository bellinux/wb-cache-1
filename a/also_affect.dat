5|$|August 30, 2005— The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Katrina produce heavy rainfall up to 5inches (125mm) {{of rain in}} the western portion of the state. High winds <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> the state, with 4,500people in Buffalo left without power after high winds downed trees and power lines.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{can have}} {{adverse effects on}} social and {{psychological}} well-being. These effects may include social isolation, stigmatization, or disability. They may result in lower educational achievement and worse employment outcomes. Learning disabilities are common in those with the condition, and especially among children with epilepsy. The stigma of epilepsy can <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> {{the families of those}} with the disorder.|$|E
5|$|However, black {{wildebeest}} can <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> {{human beings}} negatively. Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit fatal diseases like rinderpest and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E

5|$|However, blue {{wildebeest}} can <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> {{human beings}} negatively. They {{can compete with}} domestic livestock for grazing and water and can transmit fatal diseases like rinderpest to cattle and cause epidemics among animals. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E
5|$|In {{collections}} {{which contain}} fossils, high humidity can <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> pyrite (or its more reactive polymorph marcasite) (iron sulphide) fossils {{in a somewhat}} similar condition, which is known as pyrite disease. The iron sulfide can react with water and oxygen to form iron sulfates and sulfuric acid, which then can produce Bynesian decay.|$|E
5|$|In the UK {{the same}} laws {{covering}} computer crime can <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> forensic investigators. The 1990 computer misuse act legislates against unauthorised access to computer material; {{this is a}} particular concern for civil investigators who have more limitations than law enforcement.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to humans, {{at least one}} human/Kherubim hybrid (Backlash) has <b>also</b> been <b>affected</b> by the Gen-Factor. It has <b>also</b> <b>affected</b> animals, and was used in creating the Kindred.|$|R

5|$|The brain, {{although}} {{protected by}} the blood-brain barrier, can be affected by infections including viruses, bacteria and fungi. Infection may be of the meninges (meningitis), the brain matter (encephalitis), or within the brain matter (such as a cerebral abscess). Rare prion diseases including Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and its variant, and kuru may <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> the brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} ocean {{temperature}} would <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> the blue whale's food supply. The warming trend and decreased salinity levels {{would cause a}} significant shift in krill location and abundance.|$|E
5|$|The toxic {{properties}} of parsnip extracts {{are resistant to}} heating, or a storage period of several months. Toxic symptoms can <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> livestock and poultry in parts of their bodies where their skin is exposed. Polyynes {{can be found in}} Apiaceae vegetables such as parsnip, and they show cytotoxic activities.|$|E

5|$|Winter storms {{limit the}} {{expansion}} of mockingbirds in its range. The storms {{have played a role}} in the declining of the Ohio populations (where it has since recovered), Michigan, Minnesota and likely in Quebec. Dry seasons <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> the mockingbird populations in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{toxicity}} has {{not been}} seen in humans, and the toxicity depends strongly on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a median lethal dose (LD50) as low as 180mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although human toxicity data is unavailable, animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than 10mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, low birth weight, and gout; it can <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimate}} of a horse's age {{can be made}} from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough {{estimate of}} a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> the rate of tooth wear.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} human serpins perform {{extracellular}} roles, inhibiting proteases {{in the bloodstream}} in order to modulate their activities. For example, extracellular serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting (antithrombin), the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1). By inhibiting signalling cascade proteases, they can <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> development. The table of human serpins (below) provides examples {{of the range of}} functions performed by human serpin, {{as well as some of}} the diseases that result from serpin deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{are often}} {{important}} to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the moas were important browsers, {{as are the}} kereru and kokako today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved {{to protect them from}} the extinct moa. Nesting seabirds may <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.|$|E

5|$|Coral {{reefs and}} shallow marine environments are threatened, {{not only by}} natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such man-made problems as pollution, sedimentation and destructive fishing practices. Pollution {{may be the result}} of run-off from the land of sewage, agricultural products, fuel or chemicals. These may directly kill or injure marine life, or may encourage the growth of algae that smother native species, or form algal blooms with wide-ranging effects. Oil spills at sea can contaminate reefs, and <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> the eggs and larva of marine life drifting near the surface.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{color is}} {{considered}} a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye color will <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> the coat color or vice versa. The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and odd-eyed (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. Ruby refers to eyes which at a glance appear black but which are on closer observation a deep, dark red.|$|E
5|$|In the North, {{urbanization}} and {{an unprecedented}} influx {{of immigrants from}} Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture. National infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement {{and development of the}} American Old West. The later invention of electric light and the telephone would <b>also</b> <b>affect</b> communication and urban life.|$|E
