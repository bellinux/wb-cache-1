5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the show was {{operating}} on a strict budget, shots of the Chinese freighter were almost entirely created by digital technology or other special effects. For the opening scene of the ship at sea, a matte painting of a boat based on a toy model was superimposed onto a film strip of <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> ocean. Several scenes featuring the boat in port were created by filming <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> harbor and then superimposing a ship via digital technology. Special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich created a latex appliance that enabled the veterinarian to have his throat bitten out.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} propositions are true: 1. PRELIMINARIES (1) Let S, T be non empty relational {{structures and}} f be a map from S into T. Suppose f is one-to-one and onto. Then f · f − 1 = idT and f − 1 · f = idS and f − 1 is one-to-one and onto. (2) Let X, Y be non empty sets, Z be <b>a</b> non <b>empty</b> relational structure, S be <b>a</b> non <b>empty</b> relational substructure of Z [: X,Y:], T be <b>a</b> non <b>empty</b> relational substructure of (Z Y) X, and f be a map from S into T. If f is currying, one-to-one, and onto, then f − 1 is uncurrying. (3) Let X, Y be non empty sets, Z be <b>a</b> non <b>empty</b> relational structure, S be <b>a</b> non <b>empty</b> relational substructure of Z [: X,Y:], T be <b>a</b> non <b>empty</b> relational substructure of (Z Y) X, and f be a map from T into S.
