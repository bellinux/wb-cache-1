40|$|Mass {{formulae}} {{for light}} meson multiplets derived {{by means of}} exotic commutator technique can be written for complex masses. Then the real parts of the formulae give the well known mass formulae (GM-O, Schwinger and Ideal) and the imaginary ones give <b>appropriate</b> <b>sum</b> rules for total hadronic widths. Most of the observed meson nonets satisfy Schwinger mass formula (Schwinger nonet). The width sum rules for such a nonet predict that for all particles the points (m,Gamma) lie on the straight line in the complex mass plane. The sum rule is easily verifiable and expected to be well satisfied for the nonets above 1 ̃. 5 GeV. It also follows that masses and widths of the Schwinger nonet mesons submit to definite rules of order. These rules are very useful, especially {{in the cases of}} deficient experimental information.

40|$|Abstract. The density {{response}} of a doped Mott-Hubbard insulator is discussed {{starting from the}} t-J model in a slave boson 1 /N representation. In leading order O(1) the density fluctuation spectra N(q,ω) are determined by an undamped collective mode at large momentum transfer, in striking disagreement with results obtained by exact diagonalization, which reveal a very broad dispersive peak, reminescent of strong spin-charge coupling. The 1 /N corrections introduce the polaron character of the bosonic holes moving in a uniform RVB background. The resulting N(q,ω) captures all features observed in diagonalization studies, fulfills the <b>appropriate</b> <b>sum</b> rules, and apart from the broadening of the collective mode shows a new low energy feature at the energy χJ + δt related to the polaron motion in the spinon background.
