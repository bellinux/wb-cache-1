Robinson gives the Scot's word 'blout' as meaning the 'eruption of fluid' or <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> soft or wet. Both {{meanings}} would fit in this context. Blout and Bloak are very similar words, with a Bloak Moss not very far away at Auchentiber.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people who}} have an {{uncomplicated}} skin abscess should not use antibiotics. Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of cellulitis, symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing immunosuppression. People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics. If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.|$|E

After going through a teleporter, they find {{themselves}} in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not on any map of known space and time. After several battles, the Guardian reaches {{the heart of the}} Black Garden, which the Vex appear to be worshiping. The heart summons three Sol Progeny — a group of Vex units called Eschaton Mind, Imminent Mind, and Primeval Mind. After defeating the three Sol Progeny, the heart is destroyed, returning the Guardian to Mars and lifting the shroud of Darkness from the Traveler back on Earth. At the Tower, the Speaker addresses gathered Guardians in a celebratory speech. Over in the nearby hangar, though, the player's Guardian converses with the Exo Stranger, who says that the fight is far from over.|$|E

25|$|Broadcast 15 February 1995, {{the final}} episode deals with plants {{that live in}} hostile environments. Attenborough visits Ellesmere Island, north of the Arctic Circle, to {{demonstrate}} that even in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> unconducive to life, it can be found. Algae and lichens grow in or on rock, and during summer, when the ice melts, flowers are much more apparent. However, they must remain {{close to the ground}} {{to stay out of the}} chilling wind. In the Tasmanian mountains, plants conserve heat by growing into 'cushions' that act as solar panels, with as many as a million individual shoots grouped together as one. Others, such as the lobelia in Mount Kenya, have a 'fur coat' of dense hairs on their leaves. The saguaro cactus in the Sonoran Desert flourishes because of its ability to retain vast amounts of water, which can't be lost through leaves because it has none. Many desert dwellers benefit from an accelerated life cycle, blooming rapidly within weeks after rainfall. Conversely, Mount Roraima is one of the wettest places on Earth. It is a huge sandstone plateau with high waterfalls and nutrients are continuously washed away, so plants have to adapt their diet if they are to survive. A bladderwort is shown invading a bromeliad. Inhabitants of lakes have other problems to contend with: those that dominate the surface will proliferate, and the Amazon water lily provides an apt illustration. Attenborough ends the series with an entreaty for the conservation of plant species.|$|E

500|$|Barton {{does not}} believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles {{is a world of}} false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the {{screenplay}} (filmed, but not included in the theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent tells him: [...] "I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism– [...] if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath". Later, as Barton tries to explain why he's staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> [...] "less Hollywood". The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the [...] "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast. Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: [...] "The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: [...] "If your opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let you run the studio. It doesn't, and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum".|$|E
500|$|The game {{is set in}} a near-future, post-apocalyptic world. The team {{wanted to}} try {{something}} different, unwilling to return to a setting that was similar to Resistance 3. Instead of depicting a world with a dark atmosphere and gritty environments, the catastrophe that occurs in the game's story line is referred to as an [...] "awesomepocalypse” that transforms the user's initial view [...] of the game's world as a [...] "playground" [...] for players to explore and do whatever they want – [...] "emphasizing the fun of free [...] during end times." [...] The goal was to make players feel that the post-apocalyptic world in Sunset Overdrive is fun and limitless, delighting and lively, instead of <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> dreadful and worrying. To achieve this, vibrant and vivid colors were used to create the game's world and the team hoped that by tweaking the nature of the setting, the game would be [...] "self-aware, humorous, and fun". The team also intentionally avoided creating a very serious tone because the final product needed to be entertaining and comparable to games like Crazy Taxi and Jet Grind Radio, instead of something too serious that looked like an interactive movie. The team emphasized [...] "fun trumps realism" [...] and reflected that through the [...] "Next-gen Respawn" [...] system, unrealistic weaponry, and the game's visual style.|$|E
500|$|Greenwald {{first tried}} {{to take control of}} the sounds from the {{expensive}} synthesizers Guitar Center was selling by recording samples of them, but was unimpressed with the results. On a later visit to the shop, he recorded what would be the first sound to be featured on the album; he taped a guy who [...] "was just going for it on a drum kit", lowering the speed of the sample of the drum recording he used. The singer described how he felt while editing the sample: [...] "I started to hear some kind of solace in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> sonically hellish.” Greenwald started recording the album in a Guitar Center in Brooklyn, and then at a shop in Baltimore. Instead of looking to record instruments specifically planned for a song, Greenwald taped whatever sound he thought that could become better in quality when editing them later. Greenwald ended up with around 40 hours of iPhone recordings to work at his home. Some snippets were played through a 4-track tape recorder, others were old pedals and some were looped or used as synthesizer patches. These recordings were put together, EQ'd, mixed and mastered in Pro Tools. Much planning was put into how the recordings were edited together, as he tried to [...] "connect things that were seemingly un-connectable." [...] The end result was an album that featured ambient, dub, new-age, experimental and post-vaporwave styles.|$|E

2500|$|The image {{relates to}} the center of the earth (perhaps like an {{umbilical}} providing nourishment).

Its proximity to heaven may carry implications that are chiefly religious (pagoda, temple mount, minaret, church) or secular (obelisk, lighthouse, rocket, skyscraper). The image appears in religious and secular contexts. The axis mundi symbol may be found in cultures utilizing shamanic practices or animist belief systems, in major world religions, and in technologically advanced [...] "urban centers". In Mircea Eliade's opinion, [...] "Every Microcosm, every inhabited region, has a Centre; that is to say, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> sacred above all."

The specific term premenstrual syndrome appears to date from an article published in 1953 by Dalton and Green in the British Medical Journal. Since then, PMS has been a continuous presence in popular culture, occupying <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> larger than the research attention accorded it as a medical diagnosis. It has been argued that women are partially responsible for the medicalization of PMS. [...] By legitimizing this disorder, women have contributed to the social construction of PMS as an illness. [...] It has also been suggested that the public debate over PMS and PMDD was impacted by organizations who had a stake in the outcome including feminists, the American Psychiatric Association, physicians and scientists. Until the 1950s, there was little research done surrounding PMS and it was not seen as a social problem. [...] By the 1980s, however, viewing PMS in a social context had begun to take place.|$|E
