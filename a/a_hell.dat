5|$|This {{magnificent}} {{and tragic}} satire criticizes {{the prototype of}} the Latin American dictator who appeared in several places {{at the beginning of}} the century and has since reappeared, his existence being fostered by the mechanism of tyranny which, for the common man, makes every day <b>a</b> <b>hell</b> on earth. The passionate vigour with which Asturias evokes the terror and distrust which poisoned the social atmosphere of the time makes his work a challenge and an invaluable aesthetic gesture.|$|E
