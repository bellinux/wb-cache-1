5|$|The San Francisco {{regulators}} {{finished their}} report in May 1987 and recommended that Lincoln be {{seized by the}} government due to unsound lending practices. Gray, whose time as chair was about to expire, deferred <b>action</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> report, saying that his adversarial relationship with Keating would make any action he took seem vindictive, and that instead the incoming chair should take over the decision. Meanwhile, Keating {{filed a lawsuit against}} the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln. The new FHLBB chair was M. Danny Wall, who was more sympathetic to Keating and took no <b>action</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> report, saying its evidence was insufficient. In September 1987, the Lincoln investigation was removed from the San Francisco group and in May 1988, the FHLBB signed an agreement with Lincoln that included not going ahead with a criminal referral to the Department of Justice. In July 1988, a new audit of both Lincoln and American Continental began in Washington.|$|E

5|$|Du Bois {{traveled}} to Europe in 1921 {{to attend the}} second Pan-African Congress. The assembled black leaders {{from around the world}} issued the London Resolutions and established a Pan-African Association headquarters in Paris. Under Du Bois's guidance, the resolutions insisted on racial equality, and that Africa be ruled by Africans (not, as in the 1919 congress, with the consent of Africans). Du Bois restated the resolutions of the congress in his Manifesto To the League of Nations, which implored the newly formed League of Nations to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts.

With the Australians having finally halted the Japanese advance, the fresh troops would be tasked with launching a counterattack to drive the Japanese back to Buna in the north. Consequently, throughout October, November and into December, the 2/3rd Battalion took part in three major actions: Eora Creek (22–28 October), Oivi (5–12 November), and an <b>action</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sanananda Track (21 November– 19 December).|$|E

In October, he and two other Marines used machine guns to hold off an attack by a far numerically superior Japanese force. In February 1945, he was killed in <b>action</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first day of the invasion of Iwo Jima, after he single-handedly destroyed an enemy blockhouse and led a Marine tank under fire safely through a minefield.|$|E

5|$|It was Ranulf who ordained Thurstan, the archbishop-elect of York, as {{a priest}} in 1115, {{although}} Thurstan {{had to wait for}} consecration as bishop for another four years. Ranulf attended the Council of Reims in 1119 held by Pope Callixtus II. In 1125 John of Crema, the papal legate to England, visited Durham to investigate charges against the bishop. Medieval chroniclers told the story that the legate was much taken with Ranulf's niece, and after sleeping with the girl, took no <b>action</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> charges against Ranulf.

5|$|Le souper de Beaucaire was a {{political}} pamphlet written by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1793. With the French Revolution into its fourth year, civil war had spread across France between various rival political factions. Napoleon was involved in military <b>action,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> government's side, against some rebellious cities of southern France. It was during these events, in 1793, that he spoke with four merchants from the Midi and heard their views. As a loyal soldier of the Republic he responded in turn, set on dispelling the fears of the merchants and discouraging their beliefs. He later wrote about his conversation {{in the form of}} a pamphlet, calling for an end to the civil war.|$|E
