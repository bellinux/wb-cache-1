50|$|Three {{separate}} but related recalls of automobiles by Toyota Motor Corporation {{occurred at the}} end of 2009 and start of 2010. Toyota initiated the recalls, the first two {{with the assistance of the}} U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), after reports that several vehicles experienced unintended acceleration. The first recall, on November 2, 2009, was to correct a possible incursion of an incorrect or out-of-place front driver's side floor mat into the foot pedal well, which can cause pedal entrapment. The second recall, on January 21, 2010, was begun after some crashes were shown not to have been caused by floor mat incursion. This latter defect was identified as a possible mechanical sticking of the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> causing unintended acceleration, referred to as Sticking <b>Accelerator</b> <b>Pedal</b> <b>by</b> Toyota. The original action was initiated by Toyota in their Defect Information Report, dated October 5, 2009, amended January 27, 2010. Following the floor mat and <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> recalls, Toyota also issued a separate recall for hybrid anti-lock brake software in February 2010.|$|R
50|$|It was {{advertised as}} a two-door roadster, two-door {{convertible}} & two-door convertible Victoria (both new for 1932), phaeton, four-door dual-cowl phaeton & Sport Phaeton (a four-door four-seat dual-cowl phaeton new in 1932) two-door coupé, four-door sedan, landau, town car, and limousine. The Packard eight utilized {{a very rare}} swivel <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal,</b> patented <b>by</b> Pat Au {{back in the early}} 1900s.|$|R
5000|$|A related {{downshifting}} {{technique is}} called heel-and-toe, {{in which the}} brake and <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> are pressed simultaneously. Classically, the brake is pressed with the ball of the right foot and the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> is controlled <b>by</b> the right heel, while the clutch <b>pedal</b> is pressed <b>by</b> the left foot. However, variants are possible, with the brake and accelerator pressed by sides of the right foot.|$|R
40|$|Sensing the {{position}} and movement of the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> in a vehicle is important for acceleration control and safety while driving. The <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> is controlled <b>by</b> the foot, but precise adjustment requires much training because the driver must rely on somatosensory cues, which provide limited feedback. In this study, we propose periodic tactile feedback for the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> to provide an additional tactile cue. We conducted an experiment using a driving simulator to compare the lap time, the rate of off-track incidents and the subjective evaluation of controllability recorded in questionnaires. The experiment confirmed that the feedback makes the control of acceleration easier and facilitates safer driving...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a design method for layout of {{controls}} based on the equivalent inertia of human-vehicle systems. In this method, both the human and the object are modeled as articulated rigid bodies, and the posture of the human, {{the configuration of the}} vehicle, the contacts between the human and the vehicle, and the constraints on the human and on the vehicle are respectively defined prior to the analysis. The equivalent inertia of the human-machine system is then calculated at any prescribed points on the object taking the contacts and the constraints into consideration. Finally, optimization is carried out by choosing design variables and by employing the indices of equivalent inertia as the objective function. In this paper, layout designs of a steering wheel and an <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> optimized <b>by</b> using newly defined effective and ineffective equivalent inertia indices, are compared with subjective layout evaluated by human drivers. The results show the effec-tiveness of this method to design user-friendly layout for various physical sized drivers. 1...|$|R
5000|$|In {{rallying}} left-foot braking is very beneficial, {{especially to}} front-wheel drive vehicles. It {{is closely related}} to the handbrake turn, but involves locking the rear wheels using the foot brake (retarding actually, to reduce traction, rarely fully locking [...] - [...] best considered a misapplication), which is set up to apply a significant pressure bias to the rear brakes. The vehicle is balanced using engine power by use of the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal,</b> operated <b>by</b> the right foot. The left foot is thus brought into play to operate the brake. It is not as necessary to use this technique with rear-wheel drive and four-wheel drive rally vehicles because they can be easily turned rapidly by using excess power to the wheels and the use of opposite lock steering, however the technique is still beneficial when the driver needs to decelerate and slide at the same time. In rear wheel drive, left foot braking can be used when the car is at opposite lock and about to spin. Using throttle and brake will lock the front tires but not the rears, thus giving the rears more traction and bringing the front end around.|$|R
50|$|On January 30, 2010, PSA Peugeot Citroën {{announced}} it was recalling cars built in a Czech Republic plant, Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile Czech, a joint venturewith Toyota. Although the company did not say when it would begin the recall, nor how many cars were affected, the plant in question, which produces the Peugeot 107, Citroën C1 and the Toyota Aygo, produces 200,000 cars a year. On February 2, 2010, Toyota announced that the recalls could extend to Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, where Toyota said it had sold a total of 180,000 vehicles, although the company did not specify how many might be affected by a recall.

50|$|Gordon Huntley (1930 - 7 March 1988) was a {{musician}} and steel guitar player.

5000|$|On many cars, the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> {{motion is}} communicated via the {{throttle}} cable, {{to activate the}} throttle linkages, which move the throttle plate.

50|$|Automobile <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> have {{historically}} been mechanical assemblies which link the pedal to the engine throttle by mechanical linkages or a Bowden cable.

50|$|The older {{mechanically}} designed <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedals</b> {{not only}} provided a spring return, but the mechanism inherently provided some friction. This friction introduced mechanical hysteresis into the pedal force versus pedal position transfer function. Put more simply, once the pedal {{was set at}} a specific position, the friction would help keep the pedal at this setting. This {{made it easier for}} the driver to maintain a pedal position. For example, if the driver's foot is slightly jostledby a bump in road, the <b>accelerator</b> <b>pedal</b> would tend to stay at its setting. While these old purely mechanical designs did have somefriction, the return spring force was always designed to overcome this friction with a considerable safety margin. The return spring force ensured that throttle returned to zero if the <b>pedal</b> force applied <b>by</b> the driver was reduced or removed.|$|R
