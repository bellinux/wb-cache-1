25|$|Ventricular {{fibrillation}} is a {{cause of}} cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. The ventricular muscle twitches randomly rather than contracting in a co-ordinated fashion (from {{the apex of the}} heart to the outflow of the ventricles), and so the ventricles fail to pump blood around the body - because of this, it is classified as a cardiac arrest rhythm, and patients in V-fib should be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and prompt defibrillation. Left untreated, ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body, including the heart, are starved of oxygen, and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli. Prior to cardiac arrest, patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause. Patients may exhibit signs of <b>agonal</b> breathing, which to the layperson can look like normal spontaneous breathing, but it is in fact a sign of hypoperfusion of the brainstem.|$|E
2500|$|Biographer Michael Welton (Little Mosie {{from the}} Margaree: [...] A Biography of Moses Michael Coady, 2001) depicts Coady as a flawed man. “Coady’s <b>agonal</b> {{last few years}} reflect, I think, a {{profound}} state of hubris. No one can be certain how Coady deceived himself into thinking {{that he had a}} divine mission to liberate the peoples of the world.” [...] Welton compares this millenarian mindset to that of contemporaries Hitler and Stalin. He writes that although Coady tried to mask his feelings behind a veneer of faith in democracy and ordinary people, the veneer wore thin later in his life, and Coady’s faith in others was replaced by a sense of betrayal and a tendency towards manipulation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agonal</b> respirations {{are also}} {{commonly}} seen {{in cases of}} cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest where <b>agonal</b> respirations may persist for several minutes after cessation of heartbeat. The presence of <b>agonal</b> respirations in these cases indicates a more favorable prognosis than in cases of cardiac arrest without <b>agonal</b> respirations. In an unresponsive, pulseless patient in cardiac arrest, <b>agonal</b> gasps are not effective breaths. <b>Agonal</b> respiration occurs in 40% of cardiac arrests experienced outside a hospital environment.|$|E
50|$|The chief monster is a supernaturally {{powerful}} creature called <b>Agonal,</b> {{an elemental}} who feeds on agony {{and death and}} so seeks as much of such as he can. Rassilon traps <b>Agonal</b> in his tomb, just as he trapped Borusa in the television story The Five Doctors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agonal</b> {{respiration}}, gasping respiration or <b>agonal</b> {{breathing is}} an abnormal pattern of breathing and brainstem reflex characterized by gasping, labored breathing, accompanied by strange vocalizations and myoclonus. Possible causes include cerebral ischemia, extreme hypoxia or even anoxia. <b>Agonal</b> breathing {{is an extremely}} serious medical sign requiring immediate medical attention, as the condition generally progresses to complete apnea and heralds death. The duration of <b>agonal</b> respiration can be as brief as two breaths or last up to several hours. The term is sometimes (inaccurately) {{used to refer to}} labored, gasping breathing patterns accompanying organ failure (e.g. liver failure and renal failure), SIRS, septic shock, and metabolic acidosis (see Kussmaul breathing, or in general any labored breathing, including Biot's respirations and ataxic respirations). Correct usage would restrict the term to the last breaths before death.|$|E

50|$|In medicine, an <b>agonal</b> {{heart rhythm}} is {{a variant of}} {{asystole}} in which occasional P waves and QRS complexes {{can be seen on}} the electrocardiogram. The complexes tend to be wide and bizarre in morphological appearance. Clinically, an <b>agonal</b> rhythm is regarded as asystole and should be treated equivalently, with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and administration of intravenous adrenaline. As in asystole, the prognosis for a patient presenting with this rhythm is very poor.|$|E

50|$|During 1942 high {{altitude}} experiments were conducted. Victims {{were subjected to}} rapid decompression to pressures found at 4,300 m and experienced spasmodic convulsions, <b>agonal</b> breathing, and eventual death.|$|E
50|$|Evaluation of an {{unconscious}} patients breathing is often {{performed by the}} look, listen, and feel method. The ear is placed over person's mouth so breathing can be heard and felt while looking for rising chest or abdomen. The procedure should not take longer than 10 seconds. As in conscious patients stridor can be heard {{if there is an}} airway obstruction. Back fall of the tongue however results in snoring. In the unconscious patient <b>agonal</b> breathing is often mistaken for airway obstructions. If there is respiratory arrest or <b>agonal</b> breathing CPR is indicated.|$|E
50|$|Ataxic {{respiration}} is {{an abnormal}} pattern of breathing characterized by complete irregularity of breathing, with irregular pauses and increasing periods of apnea. As the breathing pattern deteriorates, it merges with <b>agonal</b> respirations.|$|E

50|$|Once {{the airway}} has been opened, the first aider would assess {{to see if}} the patient is {{breathing}}. If there is no breathing, or the patient is not breathing normally, such as <b>agonal</b> breathing, the first aider would undertake what is probably the most recognized first aid procedure—cardiopulmonary resuscitation or CPR, which involves breathing for the patient, and manually massaging the heart to promote blood flow around the body.|$|E
50|$|Owing to the {{inaccuracy}} in {{this method}} of diagnosis, some bodies such as the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) have de-emphasised its importance. The Resuscitation Council (UK), {{in line with the}} ERC's recommendations and those of the American Heart Association,have suggested that the technique should be used only by healthcare professionals with specific training and expertise, and even then that it should be viewed in conjunction with other indicators such as <b>agonal</b> respiration.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability to}} breathe spontaneously depends upon {{functioning}} {{elements in the}} medulla - the ‘respiratory centre’. In the UK, establishing a neurological diagnosis of death involves challenging this centre with the strong stimulus offered by an unusually high concentration of {{carbon dioxide in the}} arterial blood, but it is not challenged by the more powerful drive stimulus provided by anoxia - although the effect of that ultimate stimulus is sometimes seen after final disconnection of the ventilator in the form of <b>agonal</b> gasps.|$|E

50|$|CPR is {{indicated}} for any person unresponsive with no breathing or breathing only in occasional <b>agonal</b> gasps, {{as it is}} most likely {{that they are in}} cardiac arrest. If a person still has a pulse but is not breathing (respiratory arrest) artificial ventilations may be more appropriate, but, due to the difficulty people have in accurately assessing {{the presence or absence of}} a pulse, CPR guidelines recommend that lay persons should not be instructed to check the pulse, while giving healthcare professionals the option to check a pulse. In those with cardiac arrest due to trauma, CPR is considered futile but still recommended. Correcting the underlying cause such as a pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade may help.|$|E

50|$|Swallowing {{becomes a}} great {{concern for the}} elderly since strokes and Alzheimer's disease can {{interfere}} with the autonomic nervous system. Speech Pathologists commonly diagnose and treat this condition since the speech process uses the same neuromuscular structures as swallowing. Diagnostic procedures commonly performed by a Speech Pathologist to evaluate dysphagia include Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing and Modified Barium Swallow Study. Occupational Therapists may also offer swallowing rehabilitation services as well as prescribing modified feeding techniques and utensils. Consultation with a dietician is essential, {{in order to ensure}} that the individual with dysphagia is able to consume sufficient calories and nutrients to maintain health. In terminally ill patients, a failure of the reflex to swallow leads to a build-up of mucus or saliva in the throat and airways, producing a noise known as a death rattle (not to be confused with <b>agonal</b> respiration, which is an abnormal pattern of breathing due to cerebral ischemia or hypoxia).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Gene {{expression}} {{patterns in}} the brain are strongly influenced by the severity and duration of physiological stress {{at the time of}} death. This <b>agonal</b> effect, if not well controlled, can lead to spurious findings and diminished statistical power in case-control comparisons. While some recent studies match samples by tissue pH and clinically recorded <b>agonal</b> conditions, we found that these indicators were sometimes at odds with observed stress-related gene expression patterns, and that matching by these criteria still sometimes results in identifying case-control differences that are primarily driven by residual <b>agonal</b> effects. This problem is analogous to the one encountered in genetic association studies, where self-reported race and ethnicity are often imprecise proxies for an individual's actual genetic ancestry. Results We developed an <b>Agonal</b> Stress Rating (ASR) system that evaluates each sample's degree of stress based on gene expression data, and used ASRs in post hoc sample matching or covariate analysis. While gene expression patterns are generally correlated across different brain regions, we found strong region-region differences in empirical ASRs in many subjects that likely reflect inter-individual variabilities in local structure or function, resulting in region-specific vulnerability to <b>agonal</b> stress.

40|$|This thesis {{takes up}} the debate between the <b>agonal</b> and deliberative interpretations of Hannah Arendt's {{conception}} of political action. In it, I redeem the model of action as performance found in her descriptions of <b>agonal</b> politics and pull emphasis away from the deliberative model of communicative action {{on the basis of}} Arendt's ontology of temporality and her account of the witnessing and judging spectatorship that preserves the meaningfulness of human events against oblivion. I find the danger of this loss of meaning accounted for by the <b>agonal</b> model in the syncopated relationship between spectator and actor. The deliberative model of communicative action, however, collapses the roles of actor and spectator into the uniform role of participant and replaces experiential grounds of legitimacy with atemporal rational grounds. Communicative action is unable to account for the public realm as a space of endurance and skirts the ontological stakes of Arendt's <b>agonal</b> politics. 10000 - 01 - 0...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Greek word αγων (agon) {{means that}} many people {{assemble}} in some place to have a contest. Generally speaking, agon can be translated into contest, competition or disputation in modern English. Undoubtedly, nearly all the ancient civilizations have some forms of contest in a certain degree. However, {{it is only in}} Greece that <b>agonal</b> spirit was fully developed and became a fundamental characteristic of society and culture. In Greece, {{there are two kinds of}} contest, one is physical, including athletic sports and war, the Olympic Games belongs to this kind. The other is in mentality, including contest of drama and poem, lawsuit, politics, philosophy, and etc. All these contests follow the “first only rule”, reflecting Greek concept of philotimia (love of honour). Greek civilization ended, while the <b>agonal</b> spirit continued to be a special feature in the western culture afterwards. This article will expound the origin and development of the <b>agonal</b> spirit in Ancient Greece. At the same time, it will give an account of its social influences, and make a brief comparative study of <b>agonal</b> spirit between ancient China and Greece...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a law text corpus which {{consists}} of judicial decisions and jurisprudential papers on so-called assisted suicide from 1977 to 2011, <b>agonal</b> centres are determined within the paradigm of corpus-based pragma-semiotic text analysis. <b>Agonal</b> centres are defined as action-guiding concepts that are in conflict with each other concerning the general acceptance of event interpretations, options for actions, claims of validity, contextual knowledge and values. These action-guiding concepts are derived with the help of quantitative and qualitative methods. Discourse linguistic interpretations are thus rendered more objective with the help of semi-automatic methods; furthermore, specific discourse features of the discourse and approaches to interpretation can be derived from (un) expected linguistic significances of occurrence, distribution, frequency etc. at the linguistic surface. Finally, these <b>agonal</b> centres specific to the language of law are compared to <b>agonal</b> centres which are determined on {{the basis of}} a media corpus on the same issue. This provides a comparative insight into the constitution of a seemingly identical fact in everyday and special language, which demonstrates the sociopolitical relevance of analysing the constitution of reality as instructed by language...|$|E
