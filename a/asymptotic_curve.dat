This is not convergent near a stable periodic orbit, but it is convergent near an unstable periodic orbit.

This allows the theoretical calculation of the <b>asymptotic</b> <b>curves</b> and their intersections at homoclinic points. However in more complex mappings and in Hamiltonian systems the radius of convergence is in general finite and does not allow the theoretical calculation of any homoclinic point. Then we develop a method similar to analytic continuation, applicable in systems expressed in action-angle variables, that allows the calculation of the <b>asymptotic</b> <b>curves</b> to an arbitrary length. In this way we can study analytically the chaotic regions near the unstable periodic orbit and near its homoclinic points.

We consider various factors that affect the time scale of stickiness due to cantori. The overall stickiness (stickiness of the second type) is maximum near the unstable <b>asymptotic</b> <b>curves.</b> An important application of stickiness is in the outer spiral arms of strong-barred spiral galaxies.

Chaotic orbits with initial conditions on the unstable <b>asymptotic</b> <b>curves</b> of the main unstable periodic orbits follow {{the shape of the}} periodic orbits for an initial interval of time and then they are diffused outwards supporting the spiral structure of the galaxy. Chaotic orbits having small deviations from the unstable periodic orbits, stay close and along the corresponding unstable asymptotic manifolds, supporting the spiral structure for more than 10 rotations of the bar. Chaotic orbits of different Jacobi constants support different parts of the spiral structure. We also study the diffusion rate of chaotic orbits outwards and find that chaotic orbits that support the outer parts of the galaxy are diffused outwards more slowly than the orbits supporting the inner parts of the spiral structure.

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Faculty and the Board of Trustees of the Colorado School of Mines in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Geophysical Engineering. A time-domain electromagnetic survey was conducted over the East Rift Zone of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii. The purpose of the survey was two-fold. First, the survey was intended to give greater insight into interpretation techniques of time-domain electromagnetic data. Secondly, a more complete picture of the geologic structure and hydrology of the Rift, with special emphasis on its geothermal potential, was to be gained. To interpret the time-domain electromagnetic data, first the maximum-received voltages were converted to apparent resistivities and mapped. Next, the received transients were matched with a catalog of <b>asymptotic</b> <b>curves.</b> Then, theoretical layered-earth curves were calculated and the transients were again matched. Finally, use of a least-squares-fit computer program gave a more exact interpretation. Although the <b>asymptotic</b> <b>curves</b> have been calculated {{for no more than}} a three-layer case, the theoretical matching technique may be expanded to a greater number of layers.
