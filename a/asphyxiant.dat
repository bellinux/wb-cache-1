5|$|Diving gases, {{including}} compressed air, oxygen, nitrox, heliox, trimix, helium and argon, are non-toxic, non flammable, {{and may be}} oxidizer or <b>asphyxiant,</b> and {{are rated}} in Transport category 3.|$|E
5|$|Suit {{inflation}} gas may {{be carried}} in a small independent cylinder. Sometimes argon is used for superior insulation properties. This must be clearly labelled and may {{also need to be}} colour coded to avoid inadvertent use as a breathing gas, which could be fatal as argon is an <b>asphyxiant.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in xenon gas (169m/s) is less than that in air because the average {{velocity}} of the heavy xenon atoms is {{less than that of}} nitrogen and oxygen molecules in air. Hence, xenon vibrates more slowly in the vocal cords when exhaled and produces lowered voice tones, an effect opposite to the high-toned voice produced in helium. Like helium, xenon does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen, and it is both a simple <b>asphyxiant</b> and an anesthetic more powerful than nitrous oxide; consequently, and because xenon is expensive, many universities have prohibited the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration. The gas sulfur hexafluoride is similar to xenon in molecular weight (146 versus 131), less expensive, and though an <b>asphyxiant,</b> not toxic or anesthetic; it is often substituted in these demonstrations.|$|E
50|$|Noxious gases can be {{categorized}} as : Simple <b>asphyxiants,</b> chemical <b>asphyxiants,</b> and irritant gases. The simple asphixiants are nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide.The chemical <b>asphyxiants</b> are carbon monoxide, sulfuretted hydrogen and hydrogen cyanide.|$|R
50|$|Ototoxic {{effects are}} also seen with quinine, pesticides, solvents, <b>asphyxiants</b> and heavy metals such as mercury and lead.When {{combining}} multiple ototoxins, {{the risk of}} hearing loss becomes greater.|$|R
50|$|Noise acts synergistically {{with other}} hazards to {{increase}} the risk of harm to workers. In particular, noise and toxic materials (e.g. some solvents, metals, <b>asphyxiants</b> and pesticides) have some ototoxic properties may also affect the hearing function.|$|R
5|$|Although argon is non-toxic, it is 38% denser than air and {{therefore}} considered a dangerous <b>asphyxiant</b> in closed areas. It {{is difficult to}} detect because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. A 1994 incident, in which a man was asphyxiated after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe under construction in Alaska, highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.|$|E
5|$|Inhaling helium can be {{dangerous}} if done to excess, since helium is a simple <b>asphyxiant</b> and so displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration. Fatalities have been recorded, including a youth who suffocated in Vancouver in 2003 and two adults who suffocated in South Florida in 2006. In 1998, an Australian girl (her age is not known) from Victoria fell unconscious and temporarily turned blue after inhaling the entire contents of a party balloon.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen poses {{a number}} of hazards to human safety, from {{potential}} detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an <b>asphyxiant</b> in its pure, oxygen-free form. In addition, liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers (such as frostbite) associated with very cold liquids. Hydrogen dissolves in many metals, and, in addition to leaking out, may have adverse effects on them, such as hydrogen embrittlement, leading to cracks and explosions. Hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to medications, hearing loss can also result from specific chemicals: metals, such as lead; solvents, such as toluene (found in crude oil, gasoline and automobile exhaust, for example); and <b>asphyxiants.</b> Combined with noise, these ototoxic chemicals have an additive {{effect on a}} person’s hearing loss.|$|R
50|$|Chemically-induced {{hearing loss}} (CIHL) is a {{potential}} result of occupational exposures. Certain chemical compounds may have ototoxic effects. Exposure to organic solvents, heavy metals, and <b>asphyxiants</b> such as carbon monoxide can all cause hearing loss. These chemicals can be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. Damage can occur to either the inner ear or the auditory nerve.|$|R
30|$|CO and HCN are {{the main}} <b>asphyxiants</b> {{produced}} during the combustion of polyurethanes {{and there have been}} a large number of studies published regarding their yields. Isocyanates should be considered when assessing the fire toxicity of polyurethane foams, due to their acute irritating effects and chronic effects associated with exposure. However, there is very little literature available regarding the yields of isocyanates produced by the combustion of polyurethane foams.|$|R
25|$|Like all hydrocarbons, {{ethylene}} is an <b>asphyxiant</b> and combustible. It {{is listed}} as an IARC class 3 carcinogen {{as there is no}} evidence at present that it causes cancer in humans.|$|E
25|$|Waste {{deposition}} in landfills, which generate methane. Methane is highly flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air. Methane {{is also an}} <b>asphyxiant</b> and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. Asphyxia or suffocation may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below 19.5% by displacement.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of entomology, ethyl acetate is an {{effective}} <b>asphyxiant</b> for use in insect collecting and study. In a killing jar charged with ethyl acetate, the vapors will kill the collected insect quickly without destroying it. Because it is not hygroscopic, ethyl acetate also keeps the insect soft enough to allow proper mounting suitable for a collection.|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) {{is one of}} {{well known}} chemical <b>asphyxiants</b> which cause tissue hypoxia with prominent neurologic and cardiovascular injury. Cardiac dysfunction after CO poisoning can be presented as two clinical patterns. One is transient global left ventricular (LV) dysfunction {{and the other is}} LV dysfunction with regional wall motion abnormalities. In this case report, we present a case with transient LV systolic dysfunction caused by intentional exposure to CO. After conservative treatment including high concentration of oxygen, the patient recovered completely without any complication...|$|R
40|$|Research {{conducted}} {{over the last}} two decades has brought attention to the ototoxicity of chemicals in the workplace and their interaction with noise. Chemicals that have been specifically studied for their ototoxicity include solvents, metals, <b>asphyxiants,</b> PCBs and pesticides. Noise exposure is particularly damaging to the cochlea, a part of the peripheral auditory system, whereas chemicals tend to affect both the cochlear structures and the central auditory system. Reduced blood flow and free radical formation are important ototoxic mechanisms shared by noise and chemical exposures. Solvents and <b>asphyxiants</b> may also disrupt intrinsic anti-oxidant defences and make the ear more vulnerable to the effects of e. g. noise exposure. The chemicals reviewed in the present document have all been associated with auditory effects in animals. Some of the solvents and the <b>asphyxiants</b> interact synergistically with noise or potentiate noise effects on the auditory system. Combinations of chemical exposure with noise and other stressors such as physical activity during exposure may lower the concentration of the chemical exposure necessary for induction of an auditory effect. Auditory effects have also been indicated in humans for all agents covered in this document for which there are data. Noise is often present in the occupational arena, which makes prediction of the outcome challenging. As combined exposure (e. g. chemical and noise) is currently not taken care of in the regular occupational exposure limit (OEL) setting procedure, a noise notation can be used to indicate an increased risk of hearing loss after exposure to the chemical at a level close to the OEL with concurrent noise exposure. The strength of evidence for ototoxicity differs between the agents but falls basically into three categories, i. e. agents for which: 1) human data indicate auditory effects under or near existing OELs and robust animal data support an effect on hearing from exposure (styrene, toluene, carbon disulphide, lead, mercury and carbon monoxide), 2) human data are lacking whereas animal data indicate auditory effects under or near existing OELs (p-xylene, ethylbenzene and hydrogen cyanide), 3) human data are poor or lacking and animal data indicate an auditory effect well above the existing OELs (chlorobenzene, trichloroethylene, n-hexane, n-heptane, some solvent mixtures, trimethyltin, acrylonitrile, 3, 3 '-iminodipropionitrile, pesticides and PCBs) ...|$|R
25|$|Particle {{filters are}} often included, because in many cases, the {{hazardous}} materials {{are in the}} form of mist, which is captured already by the particle filter before entering the chemical adsorber. Filtration may be aided with an air pump to improve wearer comfort. Filtration of air is only possible if there is sufficient oxygen in the first place. Thus, when handling <b>asphyxiants,</b> or when ventilation is poor or the hazards are unknown, filtration is not possible and air must be supplied from a pressurized bottle as in scuba diving. Also, a gas mask does not protect against other hazards; for example, corrosive gases can damage the skin, requiring full-body protection.|$|R
25|$|A {{gas chamber}} is an {{apparatus}} for killing humans or other animals with gas, {{consisting of a}} sealed chamber into which a poisonous or <b>asphyxiant</b> gas is introduced. The most commonly used poisonous agent is hydrogen cyanide; carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide have also been used. Gas chambers were used {{as a method of}} execution for condemned prisoners in the United States beginning in the 1920s and continue to be a legal execution method in three states. During the Holocaust, large-scale gas chambers designed for mass killing were used by Nazi Germany as part of their genocide program. The use of gas chambers in North Korea has also been reported.|$|E
25|$|Methane is nontoxic, {{yet it is}} {{extremely}} flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air. Methane is violently reactive with oxidizers, halogen, and some halogen-containing compounds. Methane is also an <b>asphyxiant</b> and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. Asphyxia may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16% by displacement, as most people can tolerate a reduction from 21% to 16% without ill effects. The concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes significant {{is much higher than}} the 5–15% concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture. Methane off-gas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near landfills and expose occupants to significant levels of methane. Some buildings have specially engineered recovery systems below their basements to actively capture this gas and vent it away from the building.|$|E
500|$|Krypton is {{considered}} to be a non-toxic <b>asphyxiant.</b> Krypton has a narcotic potency seven times greater than air, and breathing an atmosphere of 50% krypton and 50% natural air (as might happen in the locality of a leak) causes narcosis in humans similar to breathing air at four times atmospheric pressure. This is comparable to scuba diving at a depth of [...] (see nitrogen narcosis) and could affect anyone breathing it. At the same time, that mixture would contain only 10% oxygen (rather than the normal 20%) and hypoxia would be a greater concern.|$|E
30|$|The {{chemistry}} of polyurethane foams and their thermal decomposition {{are discussed in}} order to assess the relationship between the chemical and physical composition of the foam and the toxic products generated during their decomposition. The toxic product generation during flaming combustion of polyurethane foams is reviewed, in order to relate the yields of toxic products and the overall fire toxicity to the fire conditions. The methods of assessment of fire toxicity are outlined in order to understand how the fire toxicity of polyurethane foams may be quantified. In particular, the ventilation condition has a critical effect on the yield of the two major <b>asphyxiants,</b> carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} 4756 deaths {{investigated}} by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 1984 - 6 found 233 deaths from asphyxiation and poisoning, excluding asphyxiations from trench cave-ins. The highest rates were in {{the oil and gas}} industry and in utilities. Toxic gases were the largest group (65) followed by simple <b>asphyxiants</b> (48), mechanical causes (42), and solvents (35). Deaths from solvents were significantly more likely in young workers. Nine deaths were caused by improper air supply to respirators and five by recreational inhalation of gas or vapours. Of the 146 deaths in confined spaces, only 12 % were in rescuers, fewer than previously reported...|$|R

500|$|Nitrogen is a {{chemical}} element with symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so {{at about the}} same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name nitrogen was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots νἰτρον [...] "nitre" [...] and -γεννᾶν [...] "to form". Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Greek άζωτικός [...] "no life", as it is an <b>asphyxiant</b> gas; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.|$|E

50|$|To {{decrease}} {{the risk of}} asphyxiation, there have been proposals to add warning odors to some commonly used gases such as nitrogen and argon. However, CGA has argued against this practice. They are concerned that odorizing may decrease worker vigilance, not everyone can smell the odorants, and assigning a different smell to each gas may be impractical. Another difficulty is that most odorants (e.g., the thiols) are chemically reactive. This {{is not a problem}} with natural gas intended to be burned as fuel, which is routinely odorized, but a major use of <b>asphyxiants</b> such as nitrogen, helium, argon and krypton is to protect reactive materials from the atmosphere.|$|R
3000|$|In {{contrast}} to the relatively well-defined effects of <b>asphyxiants,</b> the effects of exposure to irritants are more complex. Irritant gases cause pain and breathing difficulties, leading to incapacitation, such that the victim can no longer effect their own escape (ISO 13571 2012). Sensory and upper respiratory tract irritation stimulates the trigeminal and vagus nerve receptors in the eyes, nose, throat and upper respiratory tract causing discomfort, then severe pain. The effects range from tears and reflex blinking of the eyes, pain in the nose, throat and chest, breath-holding, coughing, excessive secretion of mucus, to bronchoconstriction and laryngeal spasms (Purser 2008 b). At sufficiently high concentrations, or when attached to submicron particles, such as soot, most irritants can penetrate deeper into the lungs, causing pulmonary irritation effects which may cause post-exposure respiratory distress and death, generally occurring from {{a few hours to}} several days after exposure, due to pulmonary oedema (flooding of the lungs) (ISO 13571 2007) [...]...|$|R

5000|$|An <b>asphyxiant</b> gas is a {{nontoxic}} or minimally {{toxic gas}} which reduces or displaces the normal oxygen concentration in breathing air.

40|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have shown}} that a variety of ototoxic agents (such as drugs, industrial chemicals and noise) can cause sensorineural hearing loss. The most common ototoxic drugs used in clinical practice include: aminoglycoside and macrolide antibiotics, quinoline anti-malarials, platinum analog antineoplastics, loop diuretics, and acetylsalicylic acid. Among chemical agents with potential ototoxic properties are: organic solvents, heavy metals, organotins, nitriles, <b>asphyxiants,</b> and pesticides/herbicides. Acoustic exposure to high intensity and/or prolonged noise can also cause permanent threshold shifts in auditory perception. Ototoxic agents can influence auditory function by different mechanisms: RO S overload, inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis, DNA/RNA damage, activation of the apoptotic pathways, excessive calcium influx, increase of proinflammatory cytokines, interference with fluid and electrolyte balance of the endolymph, atrophy of the stria vascularis, changes in blood-labyrinth barrier and overstimulation of the stereocilia of the ear cells. Since noise exposure and many drugs or chemical compounds frequently share the same ototoxic mechanisms, this may explain why hearing loss can be potentiated by combined exposure to these agents. However, a great variability in the individual’s response to a given xenobiotic exists and depends on a complex interplay between endogenous and exogenous factors...|$|R
40|$|Occupational {{hearing loss}} (OHL) may occur when workers {{are exposed to}} loud noise and/or ototoxic {{chemicals}} such as heavy metals, organic solvents, and <b>asphyxiants.</b> Approximately 22 million workers in the United States are exposed to hazardous noise each year, of whom 18 % have hearing loss. Surveillance is vital for preventing OHL. The establishment of prevalence and incidence estimates of hearing loss within industries is made possible through surveillance. It also enables researchers and others to identify high-risk groups, guide prevention and research efforts, and evaluate {{the success or failure}} of interventions. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) initiated the OHL Surveillance Project in 2009 to develop a national surveillance system for OHL. The project uses a novel approach to data collection by partnering with audiometric service providers to collect de-identified worker audiograms and related data. This approach allows NIOSH to collect millions of de-identified audiograms from thousands of workplaces across the United States while protecting the identities of workers, companies, and providers. NIOSH then performs OHL surveillance and research. Findings are available for use by policy makers, researchers, workers, employers, and other stakeholders. 5 / 7 / 2013 - date from document propertiesAvailable via the World Wide Web as an Acrobat. pdf file (371 KB, 1 p.) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Combustion {{toxicity}} {{data obtained}} with the DIN 53436 test method were retrospectively analyzed. The major {{objective was to}} evaluate the applicability of mathematical modeling methods for the prediction of the acute lethal toxic potency of fire effluents. All materials were tested using a combus-tion temperature of 600 &deg;C, duration of exposure of 30 min, and 5 rats/sex/ group. In most experiments the CO 2 /CO ratio appeared to be smaller than 20. The mathematical model applied accommodates lethal toxic effects related to carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride, sulphur dioxide, ammonia, and nitrogen oxide(s). The analysis of predicted and observed LC 50 data revealed a fairly good correlation (r> 0. 8). The best prediction was achieved when toxic potencies of <b>asphyxiants</b> and irritants were additively combined (slope = 0. 96, r = 0. 82). However, the correlation was best when each mode of action (asphyxia and irri-tation) were {{not considered to be}} additive (slope = 1. 12, r = 0. 88). The evalua-tion of analytical data revealed that for most of the tests performed the concen-tration of irritant gases was relatively low if compared with asphyxic gases. Only in a comparatively small number of studies lethal concentrations of irri-tants (NOx and SO 2) were produced. Experimental evidence suggests that the use of the female rats does not increase the sensitivity of the bioassay.
