As a result of hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and other natural or man-made disasters, telecommunications service vendors frequently experience a surge in requests for new services and requirements to restore existing services.

A TSP assignment ensures that it will receive priority attention by the service vendor before any non-TSP service.|$|R

The objective of this study is to develop analytical models and computational algorithms for the determination of the state subset with better performance for slotted time systems, with call traffic modeled as stationary independent arrival processes and with service time modeled as a general discrete time distribution.

40|$|The work of {{this thesis}} is {{concerned}} about the performance evaluation of multimedia communications systems supported by IEEE 802. 6 DQDB MAN (Distributed Queue Dual Buses Metropolitan Area Network). The proposed IEEE 802. 6 DQDB MAN standard, more commonly called DQDB, defines a high speed network allowing integration of <b>voice</b> and <b>data</b> over <b>circuit</b> and packet switching networks. Such networks may be particularly useful for multimedia applications within medical environments involving the transfer of voice and high resolution images. Another application of DQDB can be a backbone network interconnecting low-speed LANs (local area networks). Simulation results, based on the development of queueing models by using the QNAP 2 (Queue Network Analysis Package) simulation software, show that DQDB performs well in the above mentioned applications. However, since DQDB transfers information over short fixed-length slots, congestion problems related to the slot formatting process are observed under certain system configurations for multimedia applications. In order to reduce these congestion problems, two system improvements are proposed. The first is to consider the use of images compressed according to the technique called the reduced-difference pyramid while the second one is to allocate higher access priority to the gateways in the LANs interconnected by DQDB...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1980 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaAn {{experimental}} Canadian UHF shipborne {{satellite communications}} terminal {{was designed to}} gather the necessary data and experience prior to the possible development by Canadian industry of an operational terminal {{for use by the}} Canadian Forces, Maritime Element. Such equipment would provide a UHF satellite communications capability onboard the destroyers and frigates of the Canadian Forces. Described in the paper are the experimental terminal developed at the Communications Research Centre as well as the experience obtained (to date) through its use. In the design of the prototype terminal, flexibility and interoperability with allied forces was of prime importance. The UHF equipment developed has been used with the FLTSATCOM satellite both with high data rate, TDM-formatted signals in a single 25 kHz FLTSATCOM channel as well as with low rate single teletype signals operating near the channel edges. The terminal has the capability of transmitting either MSK or PSK signals derived from a time division multiplex of several baseband data signals. This multiplexing is performed by a programmable microcomputer-based multiplexer/demultiplexer which can supply various mixes of clear <b>voice,</b> secure <b>voice,</b> <b>data</b> and teletype <b>circuits.</b> The experimental terminal has been used during military operations in the Atlantic and as part of a double-hop secure voice circuit demonstration between Halifax and Australia...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1992 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe Edwards Digital Switch (EDS) is {{a digital}} {{communication}} system that provides advanced voice networking capabilities to the Edwards Test Range. The EDS {{is a member}} of a new family of all-digital switching systems that internally handle data in digital form. To accommodate analog <b>voice</b> and <b>data</b> <b>circuits,</b> conversions between analog and digital formats occur at the system interfaces. The EDS consists of six groups of configuration items: System-level control and monitoring is centralized in the Control and Display Subsystem. Workstations provide subsystem-level control and monitoring. The Central Switching Subsystem, as the primary interface with the range environment, provides system connectivity to radios, telephone circuits, and communications links to other facilities. It integrates the EDS with links to the Control Room Switching Subsystems. Each Control Room Switching Subsystem connects individual user stations within a Mission Control Room or other localized area. The user equipment element consists of a Subscriber Terminal Unit, Channel Expander, and interface panels for headsets, foot switches, and speakers. The Remote Radio Control Unit optimizes usage of available frequencies, allowing control of tunable radios from the Control and Display Subsystem. *The original name, Edwards Communication Switching System (ECSS) was changed to Edwards Digital Switch (EDS) in 1990. The Site Selection Unit facilitates the handover of voice communications between receiver sites when a long-range test is monitored. The system architecture is based on a central system-level control element, a central switch, multiple subsystem-level control elements, multiple subsystem switches, and end-equipment items that are interconnected through the switch network. The EDS combines multiple voice communications applications in a single system. The system is being expanded to integrate <b>voice</b> and <b>data</b> switching. Its major function is support of multiparty networked voice communications within Mission Control Rooms and between other test participants. Other voice functions are an intercom capability including both Direct Access (hot line) and Indirect Access (dial-up), subscriber loop connections to the base-level telephone exchange, and the Public Switched Network System. Digital interfaces allow integration of ciphertext data and Time Space Position Information data switching functions. A system based on the EDS design has also been installed by the Air Force at Eglin AFB. Engineering studies for systems that make use of the EDS design are currently underway by the Navy at China Lake and the Army at White Sands Missile Range. The EDS project office has actively pursued promising program management concepts such as: specifying nondevelopmental items, requiring industry standard interconnectivity and interoperability, and using a multiyear fixed-price requirements-type contract to encourage multiservice participation...|$|R
