Given the price of the TRS-80, Tandy's quality control is better than you'd expect." [...] Pournelle criticized the quality of Tandy's application and system software—including the [...] "needlessly complex" [...] TRSDOS—and high cost of its peripherals. He reported, however, that with the Omikron board, additional memory, and 8- and 5 1/4-inch disk drives, [...] "for a total cost of under $5000, you have a 48 K-byte machine capable of running all the TRS-80 programs, CP/M software, and top-grade text editors like Word Master, Magic Wand, Electric Pencil, and the Proteus editor ... all without building a single kit".|$|E
