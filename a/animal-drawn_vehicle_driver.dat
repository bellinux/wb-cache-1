25|$|In 1885, the West End Street Railway was chartered. The company {{consolidated}} {{ownership of}} existing streetcar lines in Boston {{and the inner}} suburbs, and began converting the <b>animal-drawn</b> <b>vehicles</b> to electric propulsion. The first electric trolleys ran in 1889, and the last horsecar went out of service around 1900.|$|R
25|$|Starting {{with the}} opening of the Cambridge Railroad on March 26, 1856, a profusion of {{streetcar}} lines appeared in Boston under chartered companies. Despite the change of companies, Boston is the city with the oldest continuously working streetcar system in the world. Many of these companies consolidated, and <b>animal-drawn</b> <b>vehicles</b> were converted to electric propulsion.|$|R

It was 14 m wide, and carried pedestrians, horse-drawn trams, and other <b>animal-drawn</b> <b>vehicles</b> (but fixed-axle vehicles were banned). It was inaugurated on 6 November 1892. It was São Paulo's first viaduct, and was named after a nearby tea plantation called Morro do Chá.|$|R
50|$|Colonial Williamsburg is a {{historical}} landmark and a living history museum. Its core runs along Duke of Gloucester Street and the Palace Green that extends north and south perpendicular to it. This area is largely flat, with ravines and streams branching off on the periphery. At the City of Williamsburg's discretion, Duke of Gloucester Street and other Historic Area thoroughfares are closed to motorized vehicles during the day, in favor of pedestrians, bicyclists, joggers, dog walkers, and <b>animal-drawn</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was {{primarily}} the difficult traffic that prevented Tés from improvement. It was burdensome {{to get to}} the commanding plateau by <b>animal-drawn</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The construction of the Hungarian-Western railway line was finished in 1872. Thanks to this railway, whose distance was 15 km from the village, people could reach the other parts of the country. At that time, the nearest villages could be approached on foot or by horse only. The first public transport vehicles started to operate in 1956, which meant two buses a day.|$|R
5000|$|The routing of chaussees {{was also}} {{increasingly}} demanding. For example, {{they had to}} follow [...] "the shortest possible distance between two given points" [...] as well as [...] "gradients that were not too inclined from the horizontal (three to five per cent), {{in order to keep}} the demands on <b>animal-drawn</b> <b>vehicles</b> and brakes low; they should have lay bys (24 - 30 feet wide, i.e. eight to ten metres), and also be secure from flooding, i.e. built on a raised embankment, where they run through lowland.|$|R
5000|$|Restricted-access roads, {{known as}} Autopistas or [...] Supercarreteras, are limited-access expressways with {{controlled}} points of access interchanges. Access to these roads is generally prohibited for pedestrians and <b>animal-drawn</b> <b>vehicles,</b> as fences are {{located at the}} side of the road for most of the length. Autopistas are divided highways with 4 or more lanes. Supercarreteras are always two-lane highways and are most commonly found in mountain areas. The maximum speed limit is 110 km/h for cars and 95 km/h for buses and trucks. In some cases, the maximum speed can be 120 km/h.|$|R

However, motor vehicles still have inextricable malpractices such as lower security, lower speed, dependent for energy sources, lacking of environmental protection, single purpose, lower efficiency, single directional and manual control etc. Future autos will settle these problems out and out. In the design concept, future autos will take multiple comprehensive values such as security, high speed, self-supporting power, environmental, all-purpose, high efficiency, multiple directional and intelligent controls etc., which will bring profoundly influences for human lives in many respects...|$|R

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the influence on the operational effectiveness of experienced Large Goods <b>Vehicle</b> <b>drivers</b> undertaking National Vocational Qualifications {{and the role of}} Further Education in the delivery of vocational qualifications to experienced practitioners. With the exception of studies conducted on behalf of Skills for Logistics (Grey, 2005; Winters, 2007, 2010) there was little research, which was openly available, that examined the deployment of National Vocational Qualifications to Large Goods <b>Vehicle</b> <b>drivers.</b> The specific focus of this research was concerning the effectiveness of work-based competency assessment NVQ programmes delivered to Large Goods <b>Vehicle</b> <b>drivers</b> working within the Road Freight sector of the logistics industry. Using an interpretive, qualitative based study and drawing on an Action Research approach, I analysed interview and observational data gathered during three Action Research cycles, undertaken over an eighteen month period. During the Action Research cycles, participant reflection was used as a key change mechanism. The research findings indicated a low level of satisfaction with regard to the objectives and outcomes of the National Vocational Qualifications programme for Large Goods <b>Vehicle</b> <b>drivers</b> and an unwillingness by the research participants to engage in overt reflective activity. There was very little credibility afforded to the National Vocational Qualifications by either the participating Large Goods <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Drivers</b> or their Managers. However, following the inclusion of an additional 'demand led' element into the programme, there was further evidence to demonstrate that as experienced practitioners the Large Goods <b>Vehicle</b> <b>drivers</b> did value professional development predicated upon the validity and credibility of the provision available. The key findings from the study provide evidence for concluding that professional development is valued by experienced Large Goods <b>Vehicle</b> <b>drivers,</b> who are both willing and able to engage with work-based learning if it is within the context of their experience, aspirations and praxis...|$|R

40|$|With Australia {{facing a}} looming {{shortage}} of heavy <b>vehicle</b> <b>drivers</b> {{the question is}} raised {{as to whether it}} is desirable or prudent to encourage older professional heavy <b>vehicle</b> <b>drivers</b> to remain in the transport sector for longer, particularly those of heavy <b>vehicles</b> or recruit <b>drivers</b> of a younger age. Aim: To review age-related safety and identify other factors that contribute to accidents experienced by heavy <b>vehicle</b> <b>drivers.</b> Methods: A search was conducted of national and international peer-reviewed literature in the following databases: MedLine, Embase, Cinahl, PsychInfo and the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health & Safety. A manual search was performed to obtain relevant articles within selected journals. Results: A limited number of studies reported age-specific accident rates for heavy vehicles for the spectrum of driver age that included drivers younger than 27 years and those over 60 years of age. Heavy <b>vehicle</b> <b>drivers</b> younger than 27 years of age demonstrated higher rates of accident/fatality involvement which decline and plateau until the age of 63 years where increased rates were again observed. Other contributing factors to heavy vehicle accidents include: long hours and subsequent sleepiness and fatigue, employer safety culture, vehicle configuration particularly multiple trailers, urbanisation and road classification. Conclusions: <b>Drivers</b> of heavy <b>vehicles</b> are over-involved until age 27 years however a characteristic ‘U’ shaped curve indicates a higher risk of accident involvement for both younger and older drivers. More detailed analyses of “at-fault” involvement and inability to avert an accident and other factors that contribute to accidents across the ages of heavy <b>vehicle</b> <b>drivers</b> may give further clarification to the degree of safety of both younger and older commercial heavy <b>vehicle</b> <b>drivers...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the epidemiology {{and the underlying}} pathological conditions of natural deaths among motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>drivers.</b> Sudden death while driving may cause damage to properties, other vehicles or road users. Although the Medical Commission on Accident Prevention recommended restrictions to drivers at risk of {{sudden death due to}} their medical conditions, these restrictions are useless if they do not result in greater safety to the public. DESIGN: A retrospective study of natural deaths of motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>drivers.</b> SETTING: Natural deaths of motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>drivers</b> reported to the coroner for Birmingham and Solihull. SUBJECTS: 86 consecutive natural deaths of motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>drivers</b> in a five-year period between 1984 and 1988. RESULTS: Of the 86 fatalities reviewed, 80 (93 %) sudden deaths were caused by ischaemic heart disease. Fifty vehicles were involved in collision with 32 properties, 20 other vehicles and six pedestrians. Fifty-one out of 80 cardiac deaths had past cardiac history and three had reported chest pain prior to the sudden death. CONCLUSION: An applied normative ethical assessment based on the basic moral principles of autonomy, justice, beneficence and non-maleficence are discussed. We conclude that medical screening of drivers has little benefit for the drivers or other persons...|$|R

40|$|The {{speed and}} traffic flow {{oscillations}} reflect the macroscopic effects of heavy vehicle lane changing manoeuvres on traffic flows.
