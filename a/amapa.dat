25|$|Further {{evidence}} of waterway transformation {{is found in}} Igarapé Guariba in Brazil. It is an area in the Amazon basin where people have intervened in nature to change rivers and streams with dramatic results. Researcher Hugh Raffles notes that British naturalists Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace noted waterway transformation as they sailed through a canal close {{to the town of}} Igarapé-Miri in 1848. Archival materials identifies that it had been dug out by slaves. In his studies he notes an abundance of documentary and anecdotal evidence which supports landscape transformation by the manipulation of waterways. Transformation continues in more recent times as noted when in 1961, a group of villagers from Igarapé Guariba cut a canal about two miles (3km) long across fields thick with tall papyrus grass and into dense tropical rain forest. The narrow canal and the stream that flowed into it have since formed a full-fledged river more than six hundred yards wide at its mouth, and the landscape {{in this part of the}} northern Brazilian state of <b>Amapá</b> was dramatically transformed.|$|E

It is considered the most common species of Cassinae in North America. Regions and countries where this species occurs include the East Coast of the USA, in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida (East Florida, West Florida, and the Florida Keys). It has also been recorded on the Gulf Coast of the USA, including Louisiana and Texas. The species is known {{to occur in the}} Caribbean Coast of Central America, including Mexico (Quintana Roo), Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia, as well as Venezuela (Gulf of Venezuela, Carabobo, Sucre, Isla Margarita and Los Testigos Islands). It is also found in Bermuda, the Greater Antilles, Cuba, Jamaica and Puerto Rico, and further south in the Atlantic coast of South America, Surinam, Brazil (<b>Amapá,</b> Maranhão, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Bahia, Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná and Santa Catarina), and also in Uruguay.

30|$|A clear link {{has been}} {{established}} between mercury (Hg) contamination in the Amazon region and gold mining activities due {{to the use of}} metallic Hg in the mining process (Veiga et al. 1999), however, in some cases, the link between Hg contamination (soil, sediment, fish or human) and gold mining is not always clear. For example, Quenel et al. (2007) found high levels of Hg in the hair of the Amerindian population of Trois Sauts in the upper Oyapock River (French Guiana); yet there is no gold mining in this area. Prior to Quenel’s study, Hg contamination has also been reported in riparian populations in remote areas of the upper Negro River (Silva-Forsberg et al. 1999), the Tapajos River (Castilhos et al. 1998), the Apiacas Reserve (Barbosa et al. 1997) and the <b>Amapas</b> (Bidone et al. 1997).|$|R

2500|$|With , the North is the country's largest region, {{covering}} 45.3% of {{the national}} territory. The region's principal biome is the humid tropical forest, {{also known as the}} rain forest, home to some of the planet's richest biological diversity. The North has served as a source of forest products ranging from [...] "backlands drugs" [...] (such as sarsaparilla, cocoa, cinnamon, and turtle butter) in the colonial period to rubber and Brazil nuts in more recent times. In the mid-twentieth century, nonforest products from mining, farming, and livestock-raising became more important, and in the 1980s the lumber industry boomed. In 1990, 6.6% of the region's territory was considered altered by anthropic (man-made) action, with state levels varying from 0.9% in <b>Amapá</b> to 14.0% in Rondônia.|$|E
