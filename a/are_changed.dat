5|$|High-tech {{systems may}} be {{dedicated}} devices developed solely for AAC, or non-dedicated {{devices such as}} computers that run additional software {{to allow them to}} function as AAC devices. They may be static or dynamic in form. Static communication devices have symbols in fixed positions on paper overlays, which <b>are</b> <b>changed</b> manually. To increase the vocabulary available, some static devices have multiple levels, with different words appearing on different levels. On dynamic AAC devices, the user can change the symbols available using page links to navigate to appropriate pages of vocabulary and messages.|$|E
5|$|In the {{alternative}} version, plot points <b>are</b> <b>changed</b> or expanded upon {{to allow the}} game {{to serve as a}} sequel. It also features an extended ending in which Twinrova kidnaps Zelda, and lights the third Flame of Despair to revive Ganon. The player can then enter Twinrova's lair and battle Twinrova and Ganon. Upon completing {{the alternative}} game, another password is shown that gives the player the Victory Ring, which commemorates the defeat of Ganon.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{gameplay}} is {{as that of}} Ruby and Sapphire, Emerald introduces new features. The plot is modified; both Team Magma and Aqua are villains who {{are locked}} in a constant gang war and awaken Groudon and Kyogre, respectively. When the two legendary Pokémon begin to battle each other, the protagonist must unleash the legendary Pokémon Rayquaza (pictured on the box cover) to calm them. Some of the game mechanics <b>are</b> <b>changed</b> as well. Though double battles were clearly marked in Ruby and Sapphire, in Emerald, two separate trainers might unite to battle as a pair. After the Elite Four is defeated, the player may re-battle Gym Leaders in a double battle if they are called on their PokéNav. Also, Pokémon sprites are animated in battle like they were in Pokémon Crystal. Probably the most significant addition is the Battle Frontier, an expanded version of the Battle Tower in Ruby and Sapphire.|$|E
50|$|Four of {{the bosses}} had their names <b>changed.</b> Master's name <b>was</b> <b>changed</b> to Bandit Bill, Wolf Chief <b>was</b> <b>changed</b> to Devil Hawk, Fat Man <b>was</b> <b>changed</b> to Fat Man Joe (a knockoff of Pig Joe), and Los Pubro <b>was</b> <b>changed</b> to Wingate.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the planned extension, the two tracks {{continue}} east of this station for about 700 feet along 205th Street to Webster Avenue, ending at a concrete wall, and this station does not have any crew quarters. Crews <b>are</b> <b>changed</b> at Bedford Park Boulevard, the next station south. Additionally, there is no diamond crossover between the tracks west of this station; here, a center track forms leading west to the Concourse Yard. Because of this, terminating trains arrive on the southern (railroad northbound) track and discharge their passengers before continuing east {{to the end of the}} track. They then use the diamond crossover there to return to this station on the northern (railroad southbound) track and begin service to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Due to the track configuration, trains may reverse into the yard from the southern track, and trains from the yard may start service on the northern track.|$|E
5|$|Each Province is a two-sided {{interchangeable}} board, on {{one side}} of which is a Harbinger's province while on the other are the sewers. The Provinces can be assembled in any order, which can allow different game experiences when the Provinces <b>are</b> <b>changed.</b> Each Province has its own headstone and is in the Harbinger's colours. Both sides of the Province board have paths used by the players to move around the board. Located along the paths are the six Keystones for that colour Province, and three different game symbols: the black holes, the lighting bolts and the compasses.|$|E
5|$|Kreia {{is shown}} as an elderly blind woman, whose eyes have atrophied {{from lack of}} use in {{preference}} of viewing things through the Force, viewing normal sight as a distraction. Dialogue in The Sith Lords establishes her past as a Jedi historian {{and one of the}} teachers of Revan, who became a Sith Lord and was the player character of , and how her teachings were blamed for his fall. The Sith Lords reveals she as Sith trained two antagonists of the game, Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus, before they cast her out. She is initially depicted in earth-brown hooded Jedi robes with empty white eyes, though after the revelation of her identity as Darth Traya, both a Sith and a being of betrayal, both her robes and eyes <b>are</b> <b>changed</b> to black, and she becomes more pale.|$|E
60|$|All {{those things}} were over now--perhaps that was it! Something had {{happened}} to the world and the old light had been turned out. He himself <b>was</b> <b>changed,</b> and Sid <b>was</b> <b>changed,</b> terribly changed, and Ann no doubt <b>was</b> <b>changed.</b>|$|R
30|$|How, then, {{can such}} a good and {{basically}} functional organization <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> into an excellent one which is prepared {{to take on the}} challenges of the sixth Kondratieff wave? Perhaps we should consider first how it cannot <b>be</b> <b>changed.</b> It cannot <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> by telling people that they must change their behaviour. Nor can it <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> with training or guidance or by altering structures or organizational models. Nor can it <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> by avoiding conflict or by forcing the organization to innovate. And, it cannot <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> by launching a grandiose (and expensive) programme for changing organizational culture.|$|R
50|$|KHKZ {{started off}} as country KTEX 106 (KTXF). Then in 1983 changed calls to KGAR and format to Hot AC. In 1989 the callsign letters <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> to KBOR-FM. Then again in 1992 the callsign letters <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> to KTJN. In 2003 the callsign letters <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> to KMAZ. In 2004 the callsign letters <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> to KHKZ.|$|R
5|$|The Nemesis {{appears in}} a 1999 Hong Kong manhua {{adaptation}} of Resident Evil 3 by Lee Chung Hing, Biohazard 3: Last Escape, which is named after the game's Japanese title. The 27-issue series adds to the Nemesis' backstory, detailing its origin by showing the infection and transformation of the original Tyrant by the Nemesis parasite. Some elements <b>are</b> <b>changed</b> for its design, such as the Nemesis retaining both eyes initially, and then losing the right eye and gaining cranial staples only after an encounter with Jill. The comic also introduces characters from Resident Evil 2 into the storyline, which results in a face-off between the Nemesis and the mutated William Birkin {{towards the end of}} the series.|$|E
5|$|The anime {{adaptation}} shows Deep Blue as a voice {{coming from}} a blue light, to whom Kisshu gives progress reports, and a shadowed version of his true form is seen when Quiche brings him some mew aqua in episode twenty-six. His death is changed in the anime to come {{at the hands of}} Mew Ichigo rather than Masaya, though Masaya aids her by taking over the body. To keep the true identity of Deep Blue a secret, his voice actor's name is shown only as a question mark until his identity is revealed in episode forty-nine; after which the credits <b>are</b> <b>changed</b> to list Megumi Ogata (who also voices Masaya and the Blue Knight). Deep Blue {{is one of the few}} characters whose name remains unchanged in the Mew Mew Power dub. The anime slightly modified his role from that of a savior for the aliens to a destructive force that wants to do nothing but destroy the Earth which causes the aliens to turn against him.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a first-person {{perspective}} and allows the player to undertake a series of assassination missions {{in a variety of}} ways, with an emphasis on player choice. Missions can be completed through stealth, combat, or a combination of both. Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions, eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions <b>are</b> <b>changed</b> in response to the player's violent actions or lack thereof. Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.|$|E

5|$|Unveiled in 1989, the new {{lighting}} arrangement {{required the}} removal of the contour-outlining light bulbs and the installation of 176floodlights in and around the tower's frame. From dusk to midnight, the floodlights illuminate the entire tower. Sodium vapor lamps are used from 2 October to 6 July to cover the tower in an orange color. From 7 July to 1 October, the lights <b>are</b> <b>changed</b> to metal halide lamps to illuminate the tower with a white color. The reasoning behind the change is a seasonal one. Ishii reasoned that orange is a warmer color and helps to offset the cold winter months. Conversely, white is thought a cool color that helps during the hot summer months.|$|E

Both changed names have similarities to their codenames. Also, their nationalities <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> to American from, respectively, British and Greek.|$|R
