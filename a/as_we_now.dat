5|$|Epicurus (341 – 270 BC) {{anticipated}} {{the idea of}} natural selection. The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in his poem De rerum natura (On the Nature of Things). In the Epicurean system, {{it was assumed that}} many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia in the past, but that only the most functional forms had survived to have offspring. The Epicureans did not anticipate the full theory of evolution <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> know it, but seem to have postulated separate abiogenetic events for each species.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The animal's sense organ is altered when it detects an object. This causes a perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> think the brain. This in turn causes {{a change in the}} heart's heat, which causes a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration {{in the heat of the}} heart also causes a change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|E
25|$|A final meeting {{took place}} in Oslo in September 1951, where {{marriage}} questions were again on the agenda. Various items were discussed, amongst others the growing conviction that the time had now come for the Apostolic Vicariates to become fully fledged dioceses. It was decided that a request to this effect be forwarded to Rome. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> know, this was soon to be granted.|$|E

25|$|Planetary nebulae are {{generally}} faint objects, and none are {{visible to the}} naked eye. The first planetary nebula discovered was the Dumbbell Nebula in the constellation of Vulpecula, observed by Charles Messier in 1764 and listed as M27 in his catalogue of nebulous objects. To early observers with low-resolution telescopes, M27 and subsequently discovered planetary nebulae somewhat resembled the gas giants, and William Herschel, discoverer of Uranus, eventually coined the term 'planetary nebula' for them, although, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> know, they are very different from planets.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> know, {{the fixed}} stars are not fixed. Those that {{reside in the}} Milky Way turn with the galaxy, exhibiting proper motions. Those that are outside our galaxy (such as nebulae once mistaken to be stars) {{participate}} in their own motion as well, partly due to expansion of the universe, and partly due to peculiar velocities. The Andromeda galaxy is on collision course with the Milky Way at a speed of 117km/s. The concept of inertial frames of reference is no longer tied to either the fixed stars or to absolute space. Rather, the identification of an inertial frame {{is based upon the}} simplicity of the laws of physics in the frame. In particular, the absence of fictitious forces is their identifying property.|$|E

25|$|I {{think it}} may be taken that we owe the sailors' working song <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> possess it to the Americans. How far do these songs date back? I doubt if the most ancient amongst them is much older than the century. It is {{noteworthy}} that the old voyagers do not hint at the sailors singing out or encouraging their efforts by choruses when at work. In the navy, of course, this sort of song was never permitted. Work proceeded to the strains of a fiddle, to the piping of the boatswain and his mates, or in earlier times yet, to the trumpet. The working song then is peculiar to the Merchant Service, but one may hunt through the old chronicles without encountering a suggestion of its existence prior to American independence and to the establishment of a Yankee marine.|$|E
25|$|The British central government's {{policy of}} {{cultural}} suppression against Highland culture culminated in 1747 when the Act of Proscription, which forbade {{the wearing of}} kilts by civilian males, went into effect. The Act was repealed in 1782 {{and in the early}} 19th century, there was something of a romanticisation of Highland culture (or such as it was imagined to be). This revival, later boosted greatly by Queen Victoria's enthusiasm for it, included the beginnings of the Highland games <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> know them. Highland dancing {{was an integral part of}} the Games from the very start of their modern revival, but the selection of dances performed at Games was intentionally narrowed down, mostly for the convenience of judges. Therefore, while the tradition of Highland games seemed at first glance to have fostered and preserved Highland dancing, many older dances got lost because nobody considered them worthwhile to practice, as they were not required for competition. The nature of these displays and competitions also affected the style of the dancing itself.|$|E

He offered the draft to John Murray who agreed to publish it as a book.
