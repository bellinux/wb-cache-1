5|$|In {{everyday}} life, {{there are}} three familiar dimensions of space: height, width and depth. Einstein's {{general theory of relativity}} treats time as <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional spacetime, three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity is viewed {{as a consequence of the}} geometry of spacetime.|$|E

5|$|By solving Apollonius' problem {{repeatedly}} {{to find the}} inscribed circle, the interstices between mutually tangential circles can be filled arbitrarily finely, forming an Apollonian gasket, {{also known as a}} Leibniz packing or an Apollonian packing. This gasket is a fractal, being self-similar and having <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> d that is not known exactly but is roughly 1.3, which is higher than that of a regular (or rectifiable) curve (d = 1) but less than that of a plane (d = 2). The Apollonian gasket was first described by Gottfried Leibniz in the 17th century, and is a curved precursor of the 20th-century Sierpiński triangle. The Apollonian gasket also has deep connections to other fields of mathematics; for example, it is the limit set of Kleinian groups.|$|E

Typically, three-year-old {{children are}} able to sort cards based on <b>a</b> single <b>dimension,</b> but are unable to switch to sort the cards based on <b>a</b> second <b>dimension.</b> However, five-year-old children are able to sort cards based on one dimension and can then switch to sorting cards on <b>a</b> second <b>dimension.</b>|$|R

5|$|In a final {{gesture of}} love and comprehension, after a {{lifetime}} of despising his father's stories and his father as story-teller, Will finishes the story his father has begun, pulling together the themes, images and characters of his father's storied life to blend reality and fantasy in act of communion and care. By unselfishly releasing the anger he has held about his father's stories, Will gains the understanding that all we are our stories and that his father's stories gave him a reality and substance and <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> that was as real, genuine, and deep as the day-to-day experiences that Will sought out. Will comes to understand, then, that his father—and the rest of us—are our stories and that the deeper reality of our lives may, in fact, not be our truest self.|$|E
5|$|Connor {{appears in}} the Family Reunion arc of Angel & Faith. Willow, on a quest to restore magic to herself and the world asks Angel and Faith to travel from London to LA with her so she can use the {{residual}} magic in Buffy's scythe and Connor's connection to Quor'toth to reopen the tear in reality at the Hyperion Hotel to get to <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> that has magic. Angel & Faith agree to this {{in order to gain}} the piece of Giles's soul in the scythe, but will only help reopen the tear and go to Quor'toth if Connor agrees to it. Connor is living a normal life as a college student studying social work with a girlfriend. Though initially disappointed Angel ignored his attempts to contact his father, Connor is glad to have Angel in his life and realizes that his normal life is precious, but he still wants Angel {{to be a part of}} it. Angel is genuinely proud of the man his son has become. Connor agrees that magic needs to be returned to the world as the most vulnerable in society are already starting to lose hope without it.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the early}} results from the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) was the {{discovery}} of excess infrared flux coming from Vega, beyond what would be expected from the star alone. This excess was measured at wavelengths of 25, 60, and 100μm, and came from within an angular radius of 10arcseconds (10″) centered on the star. At the measured distance of Vega, this corresponded to an actual radius of 80astronomical units (AU), where an AU is the average radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. It was proposed that this radiation came from a field of orbiting particles with <b>a</b> <b>dimension</b> {{on the order of}} a millimeter, as anything smaller would eventually be removed from the system by radiation pressure or drawn into the star by means of Poynting–Robertson drag. The latter is the result of radiation pressure creating an effective force that opposes the orbital motion of a dust particle, causing it to spiral inward. This effect is most pronounced for tiny particles that are closer to the star.|$|E

40|$|The GRID {{instrument}} {{is the first}} instrument to identify novelty as <b>a</b> separate <b>dimension</b> in the emotion domain. The {{question is whether the}} emergence of this <b>dimension</b> is <b>a</b> method artifact due to an unintended overrepresentation of novelty features or <b>a</b> genuine <b>dimension</b> in the cognitive representation in the meaning of emotion terms. In the latter case it should also be possible to identify <b>a</b> novelty <b>dimension</b> with other assessment methods. In the present chapter, it is investigated whether similarity ratings between prototypical emotion terms, where respondents can freely choose on which basis they evaluate the similarity between terms, also reveals <b>a</b> novelty <b>dimension.</b> <b>A</b> students sample evaluated the pairwise similarities between 85 emotion terms. A multidimensional scaling of these terms indeed revealed a four-dimensional structure with surprise terms scoring very high on the fourth dimension. Novelty can thus be considered as <b>a</b> genuine <b>dimension</b> in the emotion domain...|$|R
