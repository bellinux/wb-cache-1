5|$|In 1962, Kestin and Persen {{published}} a paper describing solutions for heat transfer when the thermal boundary layer is contained entirely within the momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions.

The solution to this equation, the temperature {{at any point in}} the fluid, can be expressed as an incomplete gamma function. Schlichting proposed an equivalent substitution that reduces the thermal boundary-layer equation to <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> differential equation whose solution is the same incomplete gamma function.|$|E
