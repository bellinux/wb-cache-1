However, {{when he returns}} to New York {{following}} the nuptials he discovers that he is instead married to his employee and friend Liz Lemon (Tina Fey). At the wedding, Liz was Jack's best man and wore a white shirt with a head net while Avery wore a black dress. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Liz was wearing, the minister (Jean Brassard) instead married Jack and Liz. He informs Liz that the minister married {{the two of them}} instead of him and Avery. The two set out for a divorce, however, TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) tells Liz not to sign the divorce papers as she can use their marriage to her advantage as TGS—a show she is the head writer for—is affected by budget cuts at NBC as part of the merger with the fictional network company Kabletown. She demands that Jack, an executive at NBC, give the show its lost budget but he denies the request, as a result Liz will not sign the divorce papers unless her conditions are met.|$|E

The plan apparently also involved sinking the ship that was to deliver the nonexistent coffee to hide the fraud from Castro and, according to Time magazine, to defraud its insurer, but the conspirators neglected to bribe a port official in Santo Domingo, {{and the people who}} were supposed to scuttle the boat were not allowed on board.|$|E

The poverty rate increased from 11.3percent in 2000 to 12.3percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7percent in 2004. By October 2008, due to increases in spending, the national debt had risen to $11.3trillion, an increase of over 100percent from 2000 when the debt was only $5.6trillion. Most debt was accumulated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{became known as the}} [...] "Bush tax cuts" [...] and increased national security spending. In March 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling: [...] "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure."

500|$|Throughout September, Agnew {{was in the}} news, {{generally}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{one reporter}} called his [...] "offensive and sometimes dangerous banality". He used the derogatory term [...] "Polack" [...] to describe Polish-Americans, referred to a Japanese-American reporter as [...] "the fat Jap", and appeared to dismiss poor socio-economic conditions by stating [...] "if you've seen one slum you've seen them all." [...] He attacked Humphrey as soft on communism, an appeaser like Britain's prewar prime minister Neville Chamberlain. Agnew was mocked by his Democratic opponents; a Humphrey commercial displayed the message [...] "Spiro Agnew for Vice President" [...] against a soundtrack of prolonged hysterical laughter, before a final message: [...] "This would be funny if it weren't so serious." [...] Agnew's comments outraged many, but Nixon did not rein him in; such right-wing populism had a strong appeal in the Southern states and was an effective counter to Wallace. Agnew's rhetoric was also popular in some Northern areas, and helped to galvanize [...] "white backlash" [...] into something less racially defined, more attuned to the suburban ethic defined by historian Peter B. Levy as [...] "orderliness, personal responsibility, the sanctity of hard work, the nuclear family, and law and order".|$|E

500|$|On January 9, 1779, while {{en route}} to Philadelphia, Hogun was {{promoted}} to brigadier general by the Continental Congress. [...] His promotion came about in part <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Thomas Burke, a delegate to the Continental Congress from North Carolina, and a fellow Irishman, termed the [...] "distinguished intrepidity" [...] Hogun had exhibited at Germantown. [...] This caused some controversy, as the North Carolina General Assembly, which was customarily consulted {{for the promotion of}} generals from that state, had already nominated Thomas Clark and Jethro Sumner for promotion to the rank of brigadier general. Sumner was promoted, but Clark was passed over in favor of Hogun, who received the support of nine of the thirteen states. [...] Hogun's surprising victory was due in large part Burke's lobbying efforts among his colleagues in the Continental Congress. [...] By political conventions governing such matters, Burke was bound by the vote of the North Carolina General Assembly to support the state legislature's recommendations of Clark and Sumner, but he worked to convince other Congressmen to vote for Hogun over Clark. [...] Hogun was appointed to succeed Arnold as Commandant of Philadelphia on March 19, 1779, serving until November 22 that year.|$|E
500|$|In the episode, it is {{revealed}} that Jack Donaghy accidentally married Liz Lemon {{instead of his}} girlfriend Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks). At the wedding, Liz was Jack's best man and wore a white shirt with a head net, while Avery wore a black cocktail dress. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Liz was wearing, the minister (Jean Brassard) instead married Jack and Liz. The two decide to get a divorce, however, they use their marriage to get the upper hand over one another. Ultimately, Jack and Liz decide to stop their feud and get a divorce. Since beginning, the series has occasionally hinted at a romantic {{relationship between the two}} characters. In one episode, Jack passes Liz off as his live-in girlfriend to his ex-wife Bianca (Isabella Rossellini) to make her jealous. In another episode, Jack's mother Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch) tells him that Liz is a perfect match for him, and in the same episode he has Liz listed as his emergency contact. In an April 2010 Esquire interview, Fey said that one of the plots that 30 Rock will never do is have Liz and Jack get together. [...] "Let me put the Internet at ease: Liz and Jack will never be together." [...] Alec Baldwin was asked if the two characters will ever hook-up, he responded [...] "I sincerely doubt it, and I think the show is better off that way. Once they cross that line, all the tension goes out of those relationships. And I think the lesson we learned about both those characters is that they are married to their jobs and they are married to their work." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, Rastas {{also believe}} that {{the true meaning of}} the Bible has been warped, both through {{mistranslation}} into other languages and by deliberate manipulation by those who wanted to deny black Africans their history.
