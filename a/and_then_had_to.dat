25|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, Disney's {{involvement}} during production had shrunken noticeably. As Walt was occupied with trains and {{the filming of}} Treasure Island, the directors were left to exercise their own judgment more on details. Although Walt no longer held daily story meetings, the three directors still communicated with him by mailing him memoranda, scripts, Photostats of storyboards, and acetates of soundtrack recordings {{while he was in}} England {{for two and a half}} months during the summer of 1949. When Walt did not respond, work resumed <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be undone when he did. In one instance when Walt returned to the studio on August 29, he reviewed Luske's animation sequences and ordered numerous minor changes, as well as a significant reworking of the film's climax. Production was finished by October 13, 1949.|$|E

500|$|The Fiji parrotfinch was {{initially}} described by American naturalist and entomologist Titian Peale. As chief naturalist for the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838–1842 led by Charles Wilkes, Peale collected and preserved many specimens, including the red-throated parrotfinch from Samoa and the Fiji parrotfinch from Vanua Levu. Peale named the latter species as Geospiza prasina. Peale's birds were reviewed by German physician and ornithologist Gustav Hartlaub. Hartlaub moved the Fiji species to the genus Erythrura, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> change the specific name, since another bird, the pin-tailed parrotfinch {{already had the}} binomial E.prasina. He renamed the Fiji bird as E.pealii in honour of its finder. The Fijian common names kulakula and qiqikula are derived from [...] "kula", red.|$|E
500|$|According to Rawlins, the [...] "first affair dignified by {{the name}} of a battle" [...] for any of Grant's forces {{occurred}} at Fredericktown, Missouri, where some of Grant's troops helped defeat Confederate forces under M. Jeff Thompson. [...] Grant's own first engagement came on November 7 at Belmont, Missouri, a Mississippi River landing opposite Columbus, Kentucky. Grant, accompanied by Brig. Gen. John A. McClernand, moved a force of approximately 3,000 to Belmont by water, cut his way into the Confederate camps there, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fight his way back out to regain his transports. Grant's casualties in this first battle totaled about 500; Confederate casualties were similar. While Grant had suffered a repulse, he won favorable press coverage. [...] This battle, reports Rawlins, [...] "confirmed General Grant in his views" [...] that he should [...] "give battle" [...] whenever [...] "he had what he thought a sufficient number of men." [...] Also in November, John Fremont lost his command at St. Louis, to be replaced by Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, whose command was designated the Department of the Missouri.|$|E
500|$|On 31 May, Neptune, {{under the}} command of Captain Vivian Bernard, was {{assigned}} to the 5th Division of the 1stBS and was the nineteenth ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship fired two salvos from her main guns at a barely visible battleship at 18:40. Around the time that the High Seas Fleet was reversing course beginning at 18:55 to re-engage the Grand Fleet, Neptune fired one salvo at the crippled light cruiser [...] with unknown effect. After the turn the ships of the 1stBS were the closest ones to the Germans and, at approximately 19:10, she fired four salvos at the battlecruiser , claiming two hits, although neither can be confirmed. Shortly afterwards, the ship fired her main and secondary guns at enemy destroyers without result <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> turn away to dodge three torpedoes. This was the last time that Neptune fired her guns during the battle. She expended a total of 48 twelve-inch shells (21 high explosive and 27 common pointed, capped) and 48 shells from her four-inch guns during the battle.|$|E

500|$|By the 10 January HMS Illustrious had docked in Malta. The Luftwaffe {{attacked}} the ship again and scored six damaging hits. MacLachlan's squadron failed to intercept the Ju 87 dive bombers that morning. On 16 January he witnessed several formations of Ju 87s and Junkers Ju 88s attack the ship. Unable to stand the sight, he raced {{with a fellow}} pilot to a dispersal strip and asked to take-off only to be refused permission. Three days later, MacLachlan was in action against two German units: Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 (StG 2—Dive Bomber Wing 2) and Sturzkampfgeschwader 1 (StG 1—Dive Bomber Wing 1). He attacked one Ju 87 killing the gunner before dispatching it into the sea. Returning to base he spotted a Ju 87 that had double-backed, hoping to slip past the defences to attack the aircraft carrier. MacLachlan destroyed the aircraft (3–4 victories) <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> take evasive action when attacked by an Italian CR.42. He shot the Italian fighter down: Sergente Maggiore Iacone from 70a Squadriglia bailed out was taken prisoner. He passed single CR.42s and Ju 87s flying low and unaware of his presence but his ammunition was exhausted. During {{the course of the}} mission his fifth victory made him a fighter ace. RAF fighters claimed six Ju 87s shot down during the air battle and three can be confirmed. Oberfeldwebel Kurt Zube and his gunner was killed as was Unteroffizier [...] Rudolf Vater—both served in I./StG 1. Obergefreiter Hans Küsters of II./StG 2 was also killed. A further I./StG 1 Ju 87 returned badly damaged with a dead gunner.|$|E
500|$|Throughout her career, Ayola {{has been}} outspoken {{on the subject}} of racial {{discrimination}} in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states: [...] "I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness". Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts, explaining; [...] "If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. [...] They are not being sold as a reason to watch." [...] She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating: [...] "I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [...] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it's still very low and expectations are still very low". She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that: [...] "I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they're never Welsh. [...] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I wouldn't have been in it". In 2001, Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone's Playground. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with Ayola stating: [...] "it just made me decide that if there's anything I don't want to do, it's produce films, because I'm rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> worry about how to pay for things at the end." [...] In 2008, Ayola offered her support to the [...] campaign Dignity! Period, aiming to provide affordable sanitary protection to Zimbabwean women.|$|E

2500|$|The fallout also {{affected}} islanders {{who had previously}} inhabited the atoll, and who returned there some time after the tests.

Plants and trees absorb potassium as part of the normal biological process, but will also readily absorb caesium if present, being of the same group on the periodic table, and therefore very similar chemically. [...] Islanders consuming contaminated coconut milk were found to have abnormally high concentrations of caesium in their bodies <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be evacuated from the atoll a second time.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the biggest}} fires in Stamford's history {{occurred}} April 3, 2006 in the South End.

Eight businesses were destroyed and others were damaged. City fire marshals never determined the cause, but said an unfixed sprinkler system helped the fire spread. Firefighters used 1 million gallons (...) of water in three hours <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pump water from Long Island Sound when the water mains ran out. Dark mushroom clouds formed over the scene, visible for miles along Interstate 95. About 200 residents from homes on Pacific and Henry streets were evacuated.
