50|$|A {{proclamation}} {{issued on}} the occasion of its annexation to the Habsburg Monarchy in 1908 promised these lands constitutional institutions, which should secure to their inhabitants full civil rights and a share in the management of their own affairs by means of a local representative assembly. In performance of this promise a constitution was promulgated in 1910. This included a Territorial Statute (Landesstatut) with the setting up of a Territorial Diet, regulations for the election and procedure of the Diet, a law of associations, a law of public meetings, and a law dealing with the district councils. According to this statute Bosnia-Herzegovina formed a single administrative territory under the responsible direction and supervision of the Ministry of Finance of the Dual Monarchy in Vienna. The administration of the country, together with the carrying out of the laws, devolved upon the Territorial Government in Sarajevo, which was subordinate and responsible to the Common Ministry of Finance. The existing judicial and administrative <b>authorities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Territory</b> retained their previous organization and functions. That statute introduced the modern rights and laws in Bosnia - Herzegovina, and it guaranteed generally the civil rights of the inhabitants of the Territory, namely citizenship, personal liberty, protection by the competent judicial authorities, liberty of creed and conscience, preservation of the national individuality and language, freedom of speech, freedom of learning and education, inviolability of the domicile, secrecy of posts and telegraphs, inviolability of property, the right of petition, and finally the right of holding meetings.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{housing survey}} data, describe <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> household infrastructure in Aboriginal communities in <b>the</b> Northern <b>Territory</b> (NT), {{and to discuss}} implications for health improvement for people in these communities. Design: Quantitative analysis of survey data and qualitative analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> survey process. Setting: All NT houses funded for repairs and maintenance through <b>the</b> Indigenous Housing <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern <b>Territory</b> (IHANT). Main outcome measure: Status of infrastructure necessary for four key "healthy living practices" (washing people, washing clothes and bedding, waste removal, and food storage and preparation). Results: 3906 houses (79 % of all houses funded by IHANT) were surveyed. Infrastructure components most frequently identified as not functional or not present were those required for the storage and preparation of food (62 % not functional). The facilities required for personal hygiene and safe removal of human waste were not functional in 45 %- 46 % of houses. Conclusions: These findings highlight <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> absent or non-functioning household infrastructure as a potential contributory factor in the poor nutritional status and high rates of respiratory, skin and gastrointestinal infections in Indigenous communities. The environmental health and housing survey in the NT is an important tool for monitoring progress on addressing a key underlying determinant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> health <b>of</b> Indigenous people, and potentially for facilitating research aimed at gaining an improved understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> household environment to health in Indigenous communities...|$|R
