In the process of exploring a route to the synthesis of haterumalide NA, the novel ring system, spiroepoxy-b-lactones were discovered. Spiroepoxy-b-lactones were synthesized by the oxidation of ketene-homo dimers with dimethyldioxirane (DMDO). After a synthetic route to this ring system was obtained we next explored the varied reactivity of spiroepoxy-b-lactones, and it was apparent that they might be applied to the synthesis of maculalactone A. Also with the aim of the total synthesis of the haterumalides, a palladium catalyzed cross coupling was developed.

40|$|In this {{research}} new, catalytic, enantioselective aryl transfer reactions to aldehydes for {{the synthesis of}} chiral diarylmethanols were developed. Diarylmethanols are important intermediates for the synthesis of pharmaceutically active compounds. In the foregoing research, it was found that, in presence of an appropriate catalyst, diarylmethanols could be synthesised by addition to aldehydes using <b>a</b> <b>zinc</b> <b>reagent</b> generated in situ from diphenyl- and diethylzinc. Of the catalysts tested, planar chiral organosilanols, which were produced in a multistep synthesis, smoothly effected the formation of diarylmethanols in good yields (up to 87 %) and enantioselectivities (up to 91 % ee). Other catalysts, which were applied in the asymmetric phenyl transfer, were N-substituted beta-amino alcohol derivatives, including either cis- or trans-beta-aminocyclohexanols and an open chain pyrrolinyl amino alcohol. The products were attained in good yields (73 - 99 %) with enantioselectivities of between 6 % and 87 % ee. Triphenylborane {{was used as an}} alternative phenyl source to diphenylzinc, and this reagent, when transmetalated with diethylzinc to form <b>a</b> mixed <b>zinc</b> <b>reagent,</b> selectively transferred the phenyl group to the aldehyde. This reaction system, when used {{in the presence of a}} ferrocenyl-oxazoline catalyst, gave the diarylmethanols in very good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities of up to 98 % ee. Aliphatic and heteroaromatic aldehydes could also be arylated under these conditions, and the products were obtained enantioselectively in good yields. The enantioselective phenylation of aromatic aldehydes with triphenylborane as a phenyl source was also catalysed by alpha-hydroxy-oxazolines. The products were generated with lower enantioselectivities of up to 43 % ee and in yields of up to 91 %. Diarylmethanols with substituents on both aryl groups could be synthesized by using aryl boronic acids as aryl sources and a ferrocenyl-oxazoline as a chiral catalyst. With this method it was possible to generate both enantiomers of one product using the same catalyst. The products were isolated with up to 95 % ee and in up to 89 % yield. Furthermore, a gram scale synthesis was possible using either triphenylborane or aromatic boronic acids as aryl sources. Beside the formation of diarylmethanols, an enantioselective vinylation of aldehydes for the generation of allylic alcohols was developed and optimised. Allylic alcohols are very important intermediates for the organic synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals. As such, alkenyl boronic acids were transmetalated with diethylzinc to form a mixed vinylzinc reagent. The use of additives, especially iso-propanol had a positive effect on yield and the enantioselectivity of the reaction, such that in the presence of a chiral catalyst the desired allylic alcohols were isolated in good yields (up to 79 %) and enantioselectivities (up to 75 % ee). An additional component of {{this research}} involved ethylation of an N-acylpyridinium salt with diethylzinc to furnish a 2, 3 -dihydropyridinone which, even after optimisation could only be isolated with an enantioselectivity of 11 % ee. The arylation of 4 -acetoxyacetidin- 2 -one was also of a great interest, since the products could be easily converted into beta-amino acids. Attention was, thus, mainly focused on the application of aryl boronic acids as aryl sources. However, the use of phenyl boronic acid gave the desired beta-lactam with an enantioselectivity of only 15 % ee. Another objective of this work involved its application to the synthesis of chiral precursors of the Duloxetin and other NOS-inhibitors. Two chiral alcohol precursors to these compounds were synthesised in 72 % and 55 % yield and with 69 % and 71 % ee, respectively...|$|R
30|$|The salt {{effect is}} always a {{research}} area of interest in chemical synthesis and separation. More recently, the remarkable role of halide salt additives in the Negishi reaction involving aryl <b>zinc</b> <b>reagents</b> has <b>been</b> reported (McCann and Organ 2014). It is ranked {{as one of the}} world’s top ten science and technology improvements in 2014 by Chemical & Engineering News. In our previous work, a positive effect of inorganic salts has been found for the synthesis of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane (Yin et al. 2015), and intensive studies have been carried out to explore the salt effect of various types of inorganic salt on the formation of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane (Yin et al. 2015). The results shows that higher yields of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane can be obtained in reaction solution by using the Cl−-based salts with smaller cation radius. It can be concluded that the enhancement in the yield of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane is attributed to hydration which can decrease the water activity. Though these investigations covered important aspects of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane synthesis, there is still something to be further explored, since the increase in the acid value by the addition of Cl−-based salts is still very remarkable compared to that observed for sulfuric acid alone. In addition, the presence of Cl−-based salts and the HCl formed may cause corrosion (Bao 2007). Therefore, in the present work we investigated the influence of organic salts on 1, 3, 5 -trioxane synthesis by batch reaction and continuous production experiments. In addition, UV–visible spectroscopy and vapor–liquid equilibrium experiments were also performed {{for the first time to}} investigate the mechanisms that control the effects of organic salts on the yield of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane in the reaction solution and in the distillate from the reaction.|$|R

40|$|Enantioenriched {{secondary}} alcohols are ubiquitous moieties {{in natural}} products. The current methods {{to achieve their}} synthesis often times rely on complicated synthesis and isolation of fairly reactive and unstable organometallic reagents. ^ To address these issues our group developed one-pot catalytic asymmetric methods toward the synthesis of E-allylic alcohols and diarylmethanols employing in situ synthesized functionalized Lewis acidic <b>zinc</b> <b>reagents</b> {{in the presence of}} chiral amino alcohols ligands. However, analogous methods for the synthesis of equally useful Z-allylic alcohols and diheteroaryl methanols were lacking. ^ The reason why this task was more challenging is because en route toward the synthesis of the appropriate functionalized <b>zinc</b> <b>reagents</b> <b>a</b> Lewis acidic byproduct (lithium halide) was generated which would catalyze a racemic background reaction. ^ The problem was addressed finding an additive, tetraethylethylenediamine (TEEDA), which could selectively inhibit the background reaction discriminating between the two Lewis acidic species present in the flask. The asymmetric addition could now take place giving the product in high yield and ee in one-pot. ^ In the first chapter a novel catalytic asymmetric method for the synthesis of (Z) -disubstituted allylic alcohols is presented. Our one-pot procedure entails hydroboration of chloro alkynes and addition of a hydride source (t-BuLi), which results in formation of a (Z) -alkenylborane. Boron to zinc transmetalation of the alkenyl group with ZnEt 2, addition of a chiral ligand, the inhibitor (TEEDA) and the substrate aldehyde results in formation of (Z) -allylic alcohols with excellent ee’s. In the effort of streamlining the synthesis of compounds with multiple stereocenters, tandem protocols were devised to synthesize cyclopropyl- and epoxy-alcohols. ^ Finally a brief study for the synthesis of racemic Z-trisubstituted allylic alcohols is presented. ^ In the second chapter we describe a method for the synthesis of diarylmethanols generating the desired arylzinc reagent in situ and adding it to both aromatic and heteroaromatic aldehydes. ^ The one pot procedure entails lithium/halogen exchange, transmetallation with <b>a</b> <b>zinc</b> species, with generation of undesired LiCl that can be sequestered in situ by an additive (TEEDA).

A number of different groups could be introduced in good to excellent yield, and with moderate to good stereoselectivity. The selectivity of these reactions was believed to depend on the shape of the bicyclic system, and a stereoelectronic effect of the nitrogen lone pair. The bicyclic lactam was further elaborated to an activated enone. This was shown to be relatively unreactive to cycloaddition reactions.

Firstly, a highly chemo- and stereoselective cyclopropanation of N,N-dibenzyl-protected allylic amines was developed using the highly reactive Shi’s carbenoid [CF₃CO₂ZnCH₂I]. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that the high diastereoselectivity of the reaction was likely to be due to coordination of the amine to the <b>zinc</b> carbenoid <b>reagent.</b> It <b>is</b> then shown that the reaction is general {{for a wide range of}} both cyclic and acyclic substrates giving the corresponding cyclopropanes in high yields and diastereoselectivities. Secondly, a novel stereodivergent cyclopropanation of allylic carbamates and amides was developed. It was found that reaction of cyclic allylic carbamates with the Wittig-Furukawa reagent [Zn(CH₂I) ₂] typically gives the syn-diastereoisomer in high yields and diastereoselectivities, whilst treatment of the same substrates with Shi’s carbenoid [CF₃CO₂ZnCH₂I] gives the corresponding anti-diastereoisomers in high yields and diastereoselectivities. Mechanistic investigations suggested that reactions with the Wittig-Furukawa reagent proceed via a N-directed intramolecular cyclopropanation step whilst those with Shi’s carbenoid proceed via a sterically directed intermolecular cyclopropanation step. Unsuccessful investigations into an asymmetric variant of the cyclopropanation reaction utilising chiral carbamate protecting groups are then described. Finally, studies towards the total synthesis of the potential anti-obesity therapeutic trans-SCH-A and its epimer cis-SCH-A are described.

After increasing the membrane cholesterol content by treatment of water-soluble cholesterol (cholesterol mixed with methyl-β-cyclodextrin), we observed an increase in DAT binding Bmax values for cocaine analogs [3 H]WIN 35428 and [125 I]RTI- 55, but similar levels of DAT proteins on the cell surface were shown by surface biotinylation assays. Membrane cholesterol addition also markedly enhanced the accessibility of cysteine sulfhydryl moieties in DAT as probed by a membrane-impermeable maleimide-biotin conjugate. We identified cysteine 306, a juxtamembrane residue on transmembrane domain 6 (TM 6) of DAT, as the intrinsic residue exhibiting enhanced reactivity. Similar effects on DAT cysteine accessibility and radioligand binding were observed with addition of <b>zinc,</b> <b>a</b> <b>reagent</b> known to promote the outward facing conformation of DAT. Using substituted cysteine mutants on various positions likely to be extracellular, we identified additional residues located on TM 1, TM 6, TM 7, and TM 12 of DAT that are sensitive to alterations in the membrane cholesterol content. Our findings in transfected cells and native tissues support the hypothesis that DAT adopts an outward facing conformation in a cholesterol-rich membrane environment, suggesting a novel modulatory role of the surrounding membrane lipid milieu on DAT function...|$|R
40|$|In chapter 1, we {{described}} {{the development of}} a (BINOLate) Ti-based catalyst for the asymmetric allylation of ketones. The catalyst exhibits good to excellent levels of enantioselectivity across a broad range of substrates. The products, homoallylic alcohols, are versatile materials in organic synthesis and can be transformed into other useful chiral intermediates. It is noteworthy that high enantioselectivities were obtained with a variety of cyclic enone substrates, providing access to tertiary alcohols possessing both allylic and homoallylic double bonds. ^ In chapter 2, we discussed the first catalyst for the asymmetric methallylation of ketones. The (H 8 -BINOLate) Ti complex showed better performance in methallyation than the (BINOLate) Ti catalyst, which is an excellent catalyst for the allylation of ketones. The larger dihedral angle of H 8 -BINOL may be responsible for the increased enantioselectivity over the BINOL-based catalyst. In addition, acetonitrile solvent was crucial for higher enantioselectivity in the methallylation. Acetonitrile may coordinate to the titanium catalyst and alter the structure of the catalyst. Under the optimized conditions, good to high levels of enantioselectivity were observed across a broad range of ketone substrates. These previously inaccessible tertiary homoallylic alcohols can be converted to various chiral building blocks as demonstrated by their conversion to tertiary β-hydroxy ketones. ^ The synthetic utility of cyclic enone with our allylation was explored in chapter 3. The asymmetric allylation products of cyclic enones, cyclic 1, 5 -dien- 3 -ols, underwent the asymmetric allylation and diastereoselective epoxidation in one-pot using Ti-BINOLate. Beginning from achiral precursors, this one-pot sequence affects the generation of three contiguous stereocenters with excellent enantio- and diastereoselectivity and with high yields. We also demonstrated that the oxy-Cope rearrangement proceeded well on the cyclic 1, 5 -dien- 3 -ols. The resulting β-allyl cyclic ketones are the net result of an asymmetric conjugate addition of an allyl group to a cyclic enone, a reaction that remains challenging in asymmetric catalysis. ^ In chapter 4, the catalytic arylation of aldehydes was developed beginning from readily available aryl halide. Key to the success of this methods is the introduction of a diamine, such as TEEDA. In the absence of TEEDA, the addition reaction is promoted by the LiCl byproduct, resulting in low enantioselectivity (2 %). TEEDA inhibits the LiCl byproduct and allows the addition to proceed through the chiral zinc catalyst. Importantly, {{in the presence of the}} diamine it is not necessary to filter, centrifuge, or isolate the arylzinc reagents, minimizing decomposition of these pyrophoric and moisture sensitive materials. Also noteworthy is the fact that addition of functionalized aryl <b>zinc</b> <b>reagents</b> can <b>be</b> accomplished, enabling the synthesis of a variety of benzylic alcohols that were previously difficult to access in enantioenriched form. ...|$|R
