40|$|Abstract:- This study {{examines}} the optimal run {{time for the}} economic manufacturing quantity (EMQ) model with failure-in-work, backlogging, and random breakdown happening in stock-piling time. A recent article by Chiu and Chiu [Mathematical modeling for production system with backlogging and failure in repair, Journal of Scientific & Industrial Research, 65 (2006) 499 - 506] investigated optimal lot-size for EMQ model with backordering and failure-in-rework. By incorporating random machine breakdown-another inevitable reliability factor into their model, this research examines its effects on the optimal run time and on the long-run average costs. Mathematical modeling and cost analysis are employed and the renewal reward theorem is used to cope with variable cycle length. Convexity of the expected production- inventory cost function is proved. An optimal replenishment policy that minimizes overall costs is derived for such an unreliable system. Numerical example is provided to show its practical usage. Managers in the field can <b>adopt</b> <b>this</b> run time <b>decision</b> to establish their own robust production plan accordingly...|$|R
40|$|The {{condition}} of cooperation in social {{conflicts of interest}} has been an interesting topic. On the one hand people usually desire {{to make their own}} profit. On the other hand, they mutually cooperate. This fact has motivated many researchers. Some solutions for this question have been proposed, and particular studies indicate that the diversity in decision-making or relationships promotes cooperation. In this research, we achieve the diversity by utilizing the novel method that refers to the mechanism of correction regarding each probability that every strategy comes to the representative by decision-making of group. This mechanism works when difference between the probability of the first and others becomes quite large. If once every group <b>adopts</b> <b>this</b> corrected <b>decision,</b> he/she achieves mutual cooperation of high level in the sequential prisoner's dilemma game in case the number of strategies (= players) is within the definite range. We also note that this game can effectively describe the property of evolution of strategy only with a small number of players. When each group has many players, in contrast to previous research, the decision with correction also has an effect on the suppression of prevalence of defection. In addition, we also show that the <b>decision</b> of <b>this</b> model is analogous to the system of redistribution of revenue, which provides balance of strength between several teams in professional sports. Cooperation, diversity in decision-making, evolutionary game theory, group interactions...|$|R
40|$|Countries that {{joined the}} European Union in 2004 {{have to decide}} when to <b>adopt</b> the Euro. <b>This</b> <b>decision</b> depends on the {{evaluation}} of the relative costs and benefits associated with giving up the exchange rate instrument. Recent empirical work on several new EU members has questioned the role of the exchange rate as a shock absorber, thus downplaying the potential costs in terms of macroeconomic stabilization. In this paper, we address the issue from a different perspective, emphasizing the role of pass-through from exchange rate to domestic inflation in new EU members. The focus is on four countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia – NM- 4) that have adopted some form of floating or managed exchange rate regimes. The paper reports empirical results indicating high pass-through coefficients and links them to the degree of policy accommodation. High exchange rate pass-through in NM- 4 indicates that stabilization of nominal exchange rates would lower inflationary pressures and help fulfill criteria to enter the EMU...|$|R

The term was commercially formed in 2008 but the technology has been used earlier. Modern enterprises rely greatly on information technology and as it is changing, enterprises need to change with it.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{investigates the}} optimal {{inventory}} replenishment policy {{for an economic}} production quantity (EPQ) model with backordering, rework and machine breakdown taking place in stock piling time. A prior paper by Chiu has examined the lot-sizing problem on an imperfect quality EPQ model. Due to another reliability factor- random machine breakdown seems to be inevitable in most real world manufacturing environments, {{and to deal with}} it the production planners must practically compute the mean time between failures (MTBF) and establish a robust production plan accordingly in terms of the optimal replenishment lot size that minimizes total production-inventory costs for such an unreliable system. This study extends Chiu’s work and incorporates a machine breakdown taking place in the stock piling stage into his model. The effects of random machine failure on optimal run time and on the long-run average costs are examined in this paper. Mathematical modeling and cost analysis are employed. The renewal reward theorem is utilized to cope with variable cycle length. Convexity of the long-run average cost function is proved and an optimal lot-size that minimizes the expected overall costs for such an imperfect system is derived. Numerical example is given to demonstrate its practical usage.

5000|$|Where {{the terms}} of the {{contract}} are ambiguous or susceptible to more than one meaning, evidence of surrounding circumstances and context may be admissible to assist in its interpretation. The High Court has recently reiterated the Codelfa ruling regarding the use of existence evidence in the interpretation of contacts. [...] For example, this would commonly invite one to examine the commercial purpose of the transaction, its background and context, common practices etc. [...] Moreover, courts tend to favour an interpretation that produces a reasonable commercially accepted result and avoids unjust or inconvenient consequences to both parties. It is also {{important to note that the}} subjective intention of the parties is irrelevant. The construction of contractual documents is determined by what a reasonable person in the position of the party would have understood the words to mean. With regard to a recent judgment made by the High Court in Western Export Services Inc v Jireh International Pty Ltd, Justices Gummow, Heydon and Bell agree the position of the Australian courts: where a court is not justified in disregarding unambiguous language simply because the contract would have a more commercial and businesslike operation if an interpretation different to that dictated by the language were <b>adopted.</b> <b>This</b> High Court <b>decision</b> defends the original NSW Court of Appeal judgment and ultimately upholds the rule observed in Codelfa and Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust v South Sydney City Council.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: Franchising {{is one of}} the {{fastest-growing}} operating modes in Brazil. In 2014, the Brazilian Franchising Association reported 2, 492 active brands in the country. Some theories with an economic point of view, such as the agency theory, plural forms theory, or scarcity principle, explain why companies choose franchising. However, did the decision makers and founders of these franchises decide on this strategy taking only economic reasons into consideration? The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand the a priori criteria (prior to the decision) that executives took into account when <b>adopting</b> <b>this</b> strategy and the key motivations for <b>this</b> <b>decision.</b> Originality/gap/relevance/implications: The literature emphasizes the economic reasons for the success of the franchise model, but it does not focus on the founders' motivations when they choose this strategy. This is the gap that this study seeks to address. Dissonance could arise between economic reasons and entry motivations that could result in consequences for the management of new franchises. Key methodological aspects: Ten companies of different industries and different life cycle stages involved with the franchise model were scrutinized using a semi-structured questionnaire based on the literature on decision theory and franchising. Summary of key results: Behavioral factors significantly influence decision makers when choosing the franchise model. Key considerations/conclusions: This study distinguishes the economic reasons from the executives' motivations when choosing the franchise model and highlights the importance of non-economic factors in <b>this</b> <b>decision...</b>|$|R
