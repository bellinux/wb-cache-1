For this purpose, forty-five male students of Okkoor Vellayan Chettiyar Higher Secondary School, Manamadurai, Sivagangai District, in the age group of 16 to 18 years were randomly selected as subjects. The selected subjects were assigned to one of the three groups namely; intensive interval training, extensive interval training and control group of fifteen subjects each. The selected dependent variables such as cardiorespiratory endurance and speed were appraised using methods and instruments of scientific standards. The experimental groups underwent their respective training programme for three days a week for eight weeks. To statistically analyse the changes on criterion variables, ‘ANCOVA ’ and Scheffé S test were used. The analysis of data revealed significant improvement on selected criterion variables as a result of experimental treatment. Where, intensive interval training <b>amplified</b> <b>speed</b> significantly, while extensive interval training enhanced cardiorespiratory endurance better.

40|$|This paper {{integrates}} {{a simple}} theory of identity choice into {{a framework of}} endogenous economic growth to explain how secularization can be both cause and consequence of economic development. A secular identity allows an individual to derive more pleasure from consumption than religious individuals, leading secular individuals to work harder and to save more in order to experience this pleasure from consumption. These activities are conducive to economic growth. Higher income makes consumption more affordable and increases the appeal of a secular identity for the next generation. An extension of the basic model investigates the Protestant Reformation as an intermediate stage during the take-off to growth.

We asked whether the locomotor and feeding systems evolved in association {{in one of the}} most prominent and diverse reef fish radiations, the Labridae. We examined features of the pectoral fins that affect swimming performance and aspects of the skull that describe force and motion of the jaws. We applied a recent phylogeny, calculated independent contrasts for 60 nodes and performed principal components analyses separately on contrasts for fin and skull traits. The major axes of fin and skull diversification are highly correlated; modifications of the skull to <b>amplify</b> the <b>speed</b> of jaw movements are correlated with changes in the pectoral fins that increase swimming speed, and increases in force capacity of the skull are associated with changes towards fins that produce high thrust at slow speeds.

Many different types of op-amp are used to achieve various functions, such as DC biasing, high <b>speed</b> <b>amplifying,</b> reduced voltage supply, high gain. To achieve these parameter successfully there are several techniques. The op-amp contains two stages to increase gain and improve slew rate, voltage swing, phase margin. In high resolution low voltage application where Thermal Noise and Op-amp output Swing are important then two stage op-amp is preferable to single stage. In circuits the gain provided by the input stage is not sufficient, so there is an additional amplification is required which is provided by second stage.

Accurate models of the dynamic responses of both of these systems are needed to produce realistic predictions of their effects on highway capacity and traffic flow dynamics. This paper describes the develop-ment of models of both ACC and CACC control systems {{that are based on}} real experimental data. To this end, four production vehicles were equipped with a commercial ACC system and a newly developed CACC controller. The Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) that has been widely used for ACC car-following modeling was also implemented on the production vehicles. These controllers were tested in different traffic situations in order to measure the actual responses of the vehicles. Test results indicate that: (1) the IDM controller when implemented in our experimental test vehicles does not perceptibly follow the speed changes of the preceding vehicle; (2) strings of consecutive ACC vehicles are unstable, <b>amplifying</b> the <b>speed</b> variations of preceding vehicles; and (3) strings of consecutive CACC vehicles overcome these limitations, providing smooth and stable car following responses.

40|$|Convective downburst wind storms {{generate}} the peak annual {{gust wind speed}} for {{many parts of the}} non-cyclonic world at return periods of importance for ultimate limit state design. Despite this there is little clear understanding of how to appropriately design for these wind events given their significant dissimilarities to boundary layer winds upon which most design is based. To enhance the understanding of wind fields associated with these storms a three-dimensional numerical model was developed to simulate a multitude of idealised downburst scenarios and to investigate their near-ground wind characteristics. Stationary and translating downdraft wind events in still and sheared environments were simulated with baseline results showing good agreement with previous numerical work and full-scale observational data. Significant differences are shown in the normalised peak wind speed velocity profiles depending on the environmental wind conditions {{in the vicinity of the}} simulated event. When integrated over the height of mid- to high rise structures, all simulated profiles are shown to produce wind loads smaller than an equivalent 10 m height matched open terrain boundary layer profile. This suggests that for these structures the current design approach is conservative from an ultimate loading standpoint. Investigating the influence of topography on the structure of the simulated near-ground downburst wind fields, it is shown that these features <b>amplify</b> wind <b>speeds</b> in a manner similar to that expected for boundary layer winds, but the extent of amplification is reduced. The level of reduction is shown to be dependent on the depth of the simulated downburst outflow. ...|$|R
30|$|It is a {{complicated}} dynamic phenomenon when a transient pressure pulse is triggered by two high-speed trains passing {{each other in a}} tunnel. The air pressure pulse is a transient excitation to side wall of the car body. It can stimulate almost all vibration modes of the car body and the correlated assemblies, cause serious aerodynamic noise, and have important impacts on car body distortion, train noise, and operation safety. This article analyzes the time-frequency characteristics and main parameters of field-measured the air pressure wave, and its relationship with the train velocity as well as the vibration of the car body. Cepstrum analysis concludes that in the process of the meeting, the air pressure wave in tunnel crossing is a multiplying pressure wave instead of a superposed wave. The pressure pulse during the meeting is non-symmetrical one featured with a sharp front, large amplitude, fluctuating central section, and less sharp tail. The pulse width is inversely proportional to the train speed. As the speed increases, the impulse amplitude is <b>amplified,</b> and the <b>speed</b> of pulse front is advanced.|$|R

The models consisted of parabolic bodies having 45 deg sweptback wings of aspect ratio 3. 56, at aspect ratio of 0. 3, NACA 64 A 007 airfoil sections, and tail surfaces of geometry and section identical to the wings. Two tests were conducted with the horizontal tail located in the wing chord plane with fixed incidence angles of - 1. 5 deg on one model and 0 deg on the other model.

Results of these tests are presented as incremental accelerations in the body due to buffeting, trim angles of attack, trim normal- and side-force coefficients, wing-tip helix angles, static-directional-stability derivatives, and drag coefficients plotted against Mach number. These data indicate that mild low-lift buffeting was experienced by all models over a range of Mach number from approximately 0. 7 to 1. 4. It is further indicated that this buffeting was probably induced by wing-body interference and was <b>amplified</b> at transonic <b>speeds</b> by the horizontal tail operating in the wing wake.

40|$|For the 30, 000  km long French {{conventional}} railway lines (94 % of {{the whole}} network), the train speed is currently limited to 220  km/h, whilst the speed is 320  km/h for the 1800  km long high-speed lines. Nowadays, {{there is a growing}} need to improve the services by increasing the speed limit for the conventional lines. This paper aims at studying the influence of train speed on the mechanical behaviours of track-bed materials based on field monitoring data. Emphasis is put on the behaviours of interlayer and subgrade soils. The selected experimental site is located in Vierzon, France. Several sensors including accelerometers and soil pressure gauges were installed at different depths. The vertical strains of different layers can be obtained by integrating the records of accelerometers installed at different track-bed depths. The experimentation was carried out using an intercity test train running at different speeds from 60  km/h to 200  km/h. This test train was composed of a locomotive (22. 5  Mg/axle) and 7 “Corail” coaches (10. 5  Mg/axle). It was observed that when the train speed was raised, the loadings transmitted to the track-bed increased. Moreover, the response of the track-bed materials was <b>amplified</b> by the <b>speed</b> rise at different depths: the vertical dynamic stress was increased by about 10 % when the train speed was raised from 60  km/h to 200  km/h for the locomotive loading, and the vertical strains doubled their quasi-static values in the shallow layers. Moreover, the stress–strain paths were estimated using the vertical stress and strain for each train speed. These loading paths allowed the resilient modulus Mr to be determined. It was found that the resilient modulus (Mr) was decreased by about 10 % when the train speed was increased from 100  km/h to 200  km/h. However, the damping ratio (Dr) kept stable in the range of speeds explored...|$|R

Individuals have a deep-seated, visceral fear of infection associated with the invisibility of a disease threat and the notion of horrific symptoms leading to an unpleasant death.

In addition, societies have a collective fear of contagion informed by dark memories of past pestilences such as smallpox and bubonic plague. In the case of pandemic influenza, this dread of disease would be <b>amplified</b> by the <b>speed</b> with which damage would occur. Just as nations fear military conflict because so many national achievements could be quickly undone, so too an influenza pandemic would swiftly set back hard-won economic gains and potentially undermine trust in government. And like the all-consuming effort of prosecuting a war, defeating ?the flu? would become a first order issue for governments*/one which would alter the premise for all other activity. Against this backdrop of dread, the threat posed by H 5 N 1 can be placed in perspective by examining: the story so far of how the virus has spread; the likely human damage if H 5 N 1 mutates into a pandemic form; {{and what can be done}} to mitigate that damage.

40|$|Operating {{an engine}} with excess air, under lean conditions, has {{significant}} benefits {{in terms of}} increased engine efficiency and reduced emissions. However, under high dilution levels, a lean limit is reached where combustion becomes unstable, significantly deteriorating drivability and engine efficiency, thus limiting the full potential of lean combustion. Due to hydrogen's high laminar flame speed, adding a hydrogen-rich mixture with gasoline into the engine helps stabilize combustion, extending the lean limit. This work studies the fundamental behavior of lean combustion in a spark ignition (SI) engine, identifying the processes that determine the engine's efficiency curve, and studying practical solutions to extend the peak efficiency and the lean limit. Lean and hydrogen-enhanced combustion data in a SI engine were generated covering {{a wide range of}} operating conditions including different compression ratios, loads, types of dilution, types and levels of hydrogen enhancement, and levels of turbulence. Combustion simulations were then performed to quantify the components that determine the efficiency vs. dilution curve. Results showed how burn duration is the primary driver of lean combustion, with a limiting 10 - 90 % burn duration at peak efficiency and a limiting 0 - 10 % burn duration at the onset of rapid combustion variability. (cont.) These two burn durations, while correlated, are affected differently by laminar flame speed and turbulence. Consequently the effect of hydrogen enhancement on combustion will depend on operating conditions. A flame entrainment combustion model was then used to fundamentally explain the observed criticalities in the experiments. The model properly captured the physics of the combustion process, accurately predicting the data and the basic trends. The model showed that the rapid increase in variability near the lean limit is due to the inverse dependence of the eddy-burning time on the laminar flame speed. This relationship causes the eddy-burning time to grow slowly and then rapidly with decreasing laminar flame <b>speed,</b> <b>amplifying</b> the baseline, normal, random variability associated with the flame initiation process. Due to the effect of initial conditions on combustion phasing, this increasing, but symmetric, variability during flame initiation will lead to asymmetrical variability in {{the main part of the}} combustion process. Modeling studies show how by reducing the eddy-burning time, the full burn duration curve can be shifted, extending the location of peak efficiency and the lean limit. (cont.) This can be done by increasing turbulence, effectively decreasing its microscale structure or by increasing the laminar flame speed through hydrogen enhancement. Hydrogen enhancement using reformate shows diminishing returns at high loads and high compression ratios due to the detrimental effect of high pressures on laminar flame speed. As suggested by the model, reducing the engine's baseline combustion variability during flame initiation can also extend the lean limit. These conclusions are confirmed through experimental results. by Ferrán A. Ayala. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2006.
