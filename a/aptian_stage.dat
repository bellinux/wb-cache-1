5|$|Definite Acrocanthosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in the Twin Mountains Formation of {{northern}} Texas, the Antlers Formation of southern Oklahoma, and the Cloverly Formation of north-central Wyoming and possibly even the Arundel Formation in Maryland and in Florida. These geological formations have not been dated radiometrically, but scientists have used biostratigraphy to estimate their age. Based on changes in ammonite taxa, the boundary between the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous has been located within the Glen Rose Formation of Texas, which may contain Acrocanthosaurus footprints and lies just above the Twin Mountains Formation. This indicates that the Twin Mountains Formation lies entirely within the <b>Aptian</b> <b>stage,</b> which lasted from 125 to 112million years ago. The Antlers Formation contains fossils of Deinonychus and Tenontosaurus, two dinosaur genera also found in the Cloverly Formation, which has been radiometrically dated to the Aptian and Albian stages, suggesting a similar age for the Antlers. Therefore, Acrocanthosaurus most likely existed between 125 and 100 million years ago.|$|E
2500|$|Microraptor (Greek, μικρός, mīkros: [...] "small"; Latin, raptor: [...] "one who seizes") was a genus of small, four-winged paravian dinosaurs. Numerous well-preserved fossil {{specimens}} {{have been}} recovered from Liaoning, China. They date from the early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation (<b>Aptian</b> <b>stage),</b> 120million years ago. Three species have been named (M. zhaoianus, M. gui, and M. hanqingi), though further study has suggested {{that all of them}} represent variation in a single species, which is properly called M. zhaoianus. Cryptovolans, initially described as another four-winged dinosaur, is usually considered to be a synonym of Microraptor.|$|E
