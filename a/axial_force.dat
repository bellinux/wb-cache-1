25|$|The Bennett {{fracture}} is {{an oblique}} intraarticular metacarpal fracture dislocation, {{caused by an}} <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> directed against the partially flexed metacarpal. This type of compression along the metacarpal bone is often sustained when a person punches a hard object, such as the skull or tibia of an opponent, or a wall. It can also occur {{as a result of}} a fall onto the thumb. This is a common injury sustained from bike falls, as the thumb is generally extended while around the handle bars. It is also a common injury in car crashes, especially into fixed objects, from the driver holding the steering wheel during impact. The hand moves forward, while the steering wheel rim hyperextends the thumb.|$|E
2500|$|Floating plug drawing, {{also known}} as {{floating}} mandrel drawing, uses a mandrel that is not anchored whatsoever to shape the ID of the tube. The mandrel is held in by the friction forces between the mandrel and the tube. This <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> is given by friction and pressure. The greatest advantage {{of this is that}} it can be used on extremely long lengths, sometimes up to [...] The disadvantage is it requires a precise design otherwise it will give inadequate results.

40|$|Abstract Background Different animal {{models are}} used as {{fracture}} models in orthopaedic research prior to implant use in humans, although biomechanical forces can differ to a great extend between species due to variable anatomic conditions, {{particularly with regard to}} the gait. The rabbit is an often used fracture model, but biomechanical data are very rare. The objective {{of the present study was}} to measure <b>axial</b> <b>forces,</b> bending moments, and bending axis directly in the rabbit tibia in vivo. The following hypothesis was tested: <b>Axial</b> <b>forces</b> and bending moments in the mid-diaphysis of rabbit tibia differ from other experimental animals or indirectly calculated data. Methods A minifixateur system with 4 force sensors was developed and attached to rabbit tibia (n = 4), which were subsequently ostectomised. <b>Axial</b> <b>forces,</b> bending moments and bending angles were calculated telemetrically during weight bearing in motion between 6 and 42 days post operation. Results Highest single values were 201 % body weight [% bw] for <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> and 409 % bw cm for bending moments. Whereas there was a continous decrease in <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> over time after day 10 (P = 0. 03 on day 15), a decrease in bending moments was inconsistent (P = 0. 03 on day 27). High values for bending moments were frequently, but not consistently, associated with high values for <b>axial</b> <b>forces.</b> Conclusion <b>Axial</b> <b>forces</b> in rabbit tibia exceeded <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> in sheep, and differed from indirectly calculated data. The rabbit is an appropriate fracture model because axial loads and bending moments in rabbit tibia were more closely to human conditions than in sheep tibia as an animal model. </p...|$|R

30|$|We used a {{two-dimensional}} {{finite element method}} to analyze the load-slip characteristics of nailed wooden joints sheathed with a panel. We used tests of nail bending, nail shank embedment in a wood or a panel, nail-head embedment in a face of a panel, nail withdrawing from a wood, friction between a wood and a panel, and initial <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> of the nails. The values of the material properties for the analytical models were determined with the above tests. With a conventional one-dimensional analysis {{it is impossible to}} evaluate the shearing performance accurately because the <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> of the nail are not calculated. Therefore, we used two-dimensional geometric nonlinear analysis. The computed load-slip curves closely matched the original experimental results; and when the friction and initial <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> were considered, the computed curves were more likely to match the original experimental results. Our results suggested that it is better to use geometric nonlinear analysis to analyze the shearing characteristics of nailed joints, and that friction and <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> are important factors for accurate analysis.|$|R
40|$|It is {{reported}} that RC members fail in shear after flexural yielding {{even if the}} shear strength {{is greater than the}} flexural strength. However, the shear failure mechanism of RC members is complicated and not well understood. We tested RC members where the test parameters were <b>axial</b> <b>forces</b> and loading histories. The following conclusions were obtained: (1) The latest AIJ guidelines slightly underestimate the influence of the hoop interval on ductility and overestimate that of cross-ties. (2) <b>Axial</b> <b>forces</b> delay the strength deterioration. However, the damage after the strength deterioration accumulates faster than the case of no <b>axial</b> <b>forces.</b> (3) Strength deterioration starts when tangential relative displacement along a crack becomes larger than a threshold, which is not affected by loading history...|$|R

50|$|Determination of {{the maximum}} <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> for two pieces joined by {{adhesive}} can easily be determined using two equations that {{can be derived from}} the geometry of the problem by breaking the <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> component into a tensile force and shear force normal and parallel to the scarf joint. Shear strength is assumed to be equal to σ/2. The following equations need to be adjusted if the shear strength is greater than σ/2. The two equations that give a maximum <b>axial</b> <b>force</b> are F=σ/sin(α)^2 and F=σ/sin(2α), where α is the angle from the horizontal to the joint. Both should be evaluated for a given problem, and the smaller F of the two is the magnitude {{of the maximum}} allowable <b>axial</b> <b>force.</b> The first equation accounts for failure in tension. The second equation accounts for failure in shear. Some special angles should be noted or the graphs of two equations should be compared on the same plot. The joint is weakest at α=90° due to tension limits and 45° due to shear limits. However, α=45° will be stronger than α=90° if shear strength is greater than σ/2. The joint is strongest between these two angles at 63.4°. The joint becomes stronger than 63.4° at 25.4°. At a shallow enough angle, strength of the joint continues to increase and failure will occur anywhere in the two pieces, possibly outside the joint.|$|E
