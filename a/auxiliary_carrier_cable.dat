40|$|Convergence of {{information}} industries {{has led to}} the emergence of services that cross industry boundaries. Changes in these industries have caused the organization of regulatory institutions to become inadequate. An exploratory analysis of orders issued by bureaus of the US Federal Communications Commission shows overlap in the issues on which each provides rulings. Rather than organizing into traditional industries such as common <b>carrier,</b> <b>cable,</b> and mass media, bureaus could be re-organized into functions such as oversight of rates, spectrum allocation, and universal service provision. Using theories of bureaucracy and organization, this paper proposes an explanation for the difficulties that the FCC has had in adapting to converging information industries.

2500|$|On 8 April, the {{submarine}} surfaced in a downpour to continue patrols north of West Fayu Island. Later that day, {{she set her}} course to intercept a convoy reported to be southwest of Truk. At 22:28 on 9 April, she made radar contact with a formation less than three miles (5km) distant and went to four engines to maneuver into position for an attack. In a few minutes, the formation changed course, putting Tunny in position to slow down to two-thirds speed and head in, flooded down to decks awash to avoid detection. As the convoy became visible, Tunnys commanding officer, Commander James A. Scott, could hardly believe his luck. On the starboard bow was a large aircraft carrier, to port two <b>auxiliary</b> <b>carriers,</b> and on each bow of the formation, a destroyer. Given this perfect setup, Tunny maneuvered to swing the bow on twin targets, but her plans were disrupted when three small boats similar to motor torpedo boats appeared only [...] off her port bow.

40|$|Abstract- Handover {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parts in mobility management. In the LTE-Advanced system, new technologies such as relay and carrier aggregation are introduced, which put forward higher requirements and challenges to the handover mechanism. By studying the handover process of the traditional LTE-Advanced system and LTE-Advanced Relay system, this paper proposes a cooperative handover algorithm with the consideration of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>carrier</b> in LTE-Advanced relay system. This algorithm takes the advantages of wide spreading of low-frequency carrier, rich resources of high- frequency carrier, and in conjunction with relay technology and carrier aggregation technology. The propose algorithm reduces the handover outage probability and improve the throughput of the system...|$|R
