25|$|Researcher and {{composer}} Miguel Angel Martin {{writes in his}} book Del Folclor llanero (Folklore from the eastern plains) from 1978:"I believe the tiple was brought {{to us from the}} Canary Islands <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> first tiples were made at the settlements of Tamara, Morcote, Pauto and Tame in the Casanare".|$|E
500|$|In {{the course}} of my journeys, I observe that I receive upon an average two-thirds {{counterfeit}} halfpence for change at toll-gates, etc. <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> evil is daily increasing, as the spurious money is carried into circulation by the lowest class of manufacturers, who pay with it the principal part of the wages of the poor people they employ. [...] They purchase from the subterraneous coiners 36 shillings'-worth of copper (in nominal value) for 20 shillings, so that the profit derived from the cheating is very large.|$|E
2500|$|... "In {{established}} engineering disciplines a 12% improvement, easily obtained, {{is never}} considered marginal <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> same viewpoint should prevail in software engineering" ...|$|E
25|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in <b>the</b> {{communion of}} Saints.|$|R
5000|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in <b>the</b> Holy Spirit, the Lord, and Giver of Life, ...|$|R

2500|$|... "he was a zealot in {{this new}} model <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> {{disappointment}} they met [...] and the odium they contracted help to bring ye asthma on him" ...|$|E
2500|$|Baseball writer John Thorn commented in his book, Baseball in the Garden of Eden: The Secret History of the Early Game, that Creighton [...] "was baseball's first hero, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} player not {{inducted into the}} Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Department well {{knows that}} Maniu has stood out boldly as a {{champion}} of pro-Allied action and sentiment in Rumania even during the dark days of the Antonescu dictatorship. He has an enormous political following in the country <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> respect in which all Rumanians hold him eclipses that held for any other Rumanian. Because of what he has been and what he is it seems important that he be preserved from slipping into sharing the general conviction that the dissolution of the Rumanian state is now in progress." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The city, sire, is calm, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> content. <b>The</b> sultan <b>and</b> the caliph {{are still}} {{hovering}} on {{the borders of}} the province.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Brandreth, I think you've {{really been}} victimised; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> Social Union {{will ever be}} worth what it's costing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote: These {{lines are}} also ancient, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> to <b>the</b> tune of 'We'll never hae peace till Jamie comes hame,' to which Burns {{likewise}} wrote some verses.] ...|$|R
2500|$|On December 22, Judy Chu, Chair of the State Board of Equalization, {{announced}} that she would run in the special election. She said, [...] "I've decided to heed those calls [...] I know this district very, very well <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> people of this district know me and know I'm very devoted to the San Gabriel Valley". The congressional district makeup was 48% Latino and 13% Asian. [...] She began campaigning heavily, and captured the endorsements of several San Gabriel Valley politicos. [...] (The following month, Chu became Vice Chair of the Board of Equalization.) ...|$|E
60|$|SURFACE. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> Abuse {{was no more}} {{acceptable}} to your Ladyship than Maria.|$|E
6000|$|She faced {{him with}} convincing candor. [...] "No, I don't. I {{think she is}} {{perfectly}} simple and straightforward, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> writing is supernormal." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{left him}} still harping on that string, <b>and</b> suffering, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>the</b> only serious attack of mental {{distress}} {{that had ever}} affected him in the whole course of his life.|$|R
6000|$|... 'As for me,' said {{a fourth}} robber, of very dark {{complexion}} and singularly small bright eyes, 'I am an Indian, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in <b>the</b> great golden figure with carbuncle eyes, {{in the temple}} of Delhi.' ...|$|R
60|$|John Claverhouse was a moon-faced man. You {{know the}} kind, cheek-bones wide apart, chin and {{forehead}} melting into the cheeks {{to complete the}} perfect round, and the nose, broad and pudgy, equidistant from the circumference, flattened against the very centre of the face like a dough-ball upon the ceiling. Perhaps that is why I hated him, for truly he had become an offense to my eyes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> earth to be cumbered with his presence. Perhaps my mother may have been superstitious of the moon and looked upon it over the wrong shoulder at the wrong time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bad luck crushes bulls {{as easily}} as bullaces; <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>the</b> fury dogs you: you were born {{with a wooden spoon}} in your mouth, depend on it." ...|$|E
60|$|While {{this was}} being done Seth made no resistance; but gazed at us with terror in his eyes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> scoundrel was firmly {{convinced}} we had brought him there to his death.|$|E
6000|$|... 'True,' said Philip; 'I {{have often}} been struck by finding how ignorant people are, even of Shakspeare; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> blame chiefly rests on the cheap rubbish in which Charlie is nearly walled up there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought so, at first," [...] Solomon admitted, [...] "but now our hand {{is placed}} on the plow, we must not draw back; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>the</b> God of our fathers will show his might before the heathen." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{first person}} whom I saw was Bill Jepson. He had been searching through the barracks for Jerry <b>and</b> me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> old fellow was heartily pleased at seeing us once more.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has always}} been so," [...] said Caroline. [...] "He and his sister are quite {{different}} in looks and constitution from poor Fordham, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> from <b>the</b> elder ones. They are shorter and sturdier, and take after their mother's family." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{shall never}} see his like again if we live a hundred years. He was the ablest man, the truest gentleman, the firmest friend, the finest sportsman, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>the</b> best shot in all Africa.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought so; but I only {{told her}} it was no such thing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> child thought I meant to rebuke her for {{mentioning}} such frivolities, for she turned scarlet and held her peace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{is it not}} one?" [...] said Eleanor. [...] "Were I a man, I know none I should {{prefer to}} it, except painting. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> one is as much in your power as the other." ...|$|E
60|$|This is {{the first}} and last time {{throughout}} the Bible, that we find this Obadiah mentioned. We find the same name elsewhere, but not the same person. It is a common Jewish name, Obadiah, <b>and</b> means, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>the</b> servant of the Lord.|$|R
5000|$|... "In {{summing up}} my fights, {{throughout}} my career, there were none, {{even in the}} championship bouts, which were harder than those with Griffen (sic), <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>the</b> greatest punishment I ever received in the ring was {{at the hands of}} Griffen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Glad {{you like}} to be up betimes, sir," [...] said she. [...] "That's my way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> find it pays. Nobody works as well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> plants <b>and</b> stock grow as well, while we are asleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] {{returned}} his dragoman confidentially, [...] "in that sentiment {{you would have}} with you the whole male population. <b>And,</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>the</b> whole of the female population would feel the same if they were tired of you, as the husband." ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{mountain}} soil I first drew life: [...] The mists of the Taglay have shed [...] Nightly their dews upon my head, [...] <b>And,</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>the</b> winged strife [...] And tumult of the headlong air [...] Have nestled in my very hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it will be}} a case of 'God {{help the}} man who's chained to our Davie.' The worst is that we don't know when it will happen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> {{uncertainty}} and the waiting have sent Dick to the whiskey more than anything else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{know that}} I sympathise {{with all your}} anxieties about Church matters. Parliamentary {{legislation}} would be the greatest evil of all. All your troubles only show that synodical action, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> with <b>the</b> laity in the Synod, is the only cure for these troubles.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>believed</b> {{nothing of}} that part; but <b>I</b> <b>believed,</b> as it was, that {{whatever}} was done, Amy had done it; and that, in short, Amy {{had made her}} away; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> it <b>the</b> more, because Amy came no more near me, but confirmed her guilt by her absence.|$|R
25|$|To put {{artifacts}} {{in their proper}} context I consider it most important {{to pay attention to}} <b>the</b> chronological sequence, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>the</b> old idea of first stone, then copper, and finally iron, appears to be ever more firmly established as far as Scandinavia is concerned.|$|R
