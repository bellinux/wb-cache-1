5000|$|In many {{municipalities}} {{across the}} United States, {{policies have been}} adopted to fine home and business owners for multiple false alarm activations from their security system. If multiple false alarms from the same property persist, that property could even be added to a [...] "no response" [...] list, which bars police dispatch to the property except {{in the event of}} verified emergency. Approximately 1% of police alarm calls actually involve a crime. Nuisance alarms occur when an unintended event evokes an <b>alarm</b> <b>status</b> by an otherwise properly working alarm system. A false alarm also occurs when there is an alarm system malfunction that results in an alarm state. In all three circumstances, the source of the problem should be immediately found and fixed, so that responders will not lose confidence in the alarm reports. It is easier to know when there are false alarms, because the system is designed to react to that condition. Failure alarms are more troublesome because they usually require periodic testing to make sure the sensors are working and that the correct signals are getting through to the monitor. Some systems are designed to detect problems internally, such as low or dead batteries, loose connections, phone circuit trouble, etc. While earlier nuisance alarms could be set off by small disturbances, like insects or pets, newer model alarms have technology to measure the size/weight of the object causing the disturbance, and thus are able to decide how serious the threat is, which is especially useful in burglar alarms.|$|E

30|$|For the ED each sensor {{independently}} decides first its <b>alarm</b> <b>status</b> {{based on}} its own measurements.

30|$|In this article, we {{consider}} various collaboration schemes {{that can be}} employed {{by a pair of}} nodes. A straightforward solution would be for each sensor node to use the ED so that each individual node would determine its <b>alarm</b> <b>status</b> and then the pair would determine its collective decision using an AND or an OR rule. Another possibility is for the pair to exchange all of their measurements and decide its alarmed status based on the sample covariance. This {{is referred to as the}} covariance detector (CD). In this article, we also consider a hybrid detection scheme (the enhanced covariance detector (ECD)) that combines the strengths of the ED and the CD for closely spaced sensor nodes. By utilizing two different thresholds, one for each detector used, the ECD can improve the overall coverage while attaining the same probability of false alarms as any individual detector. An important outcome of this work is that it shows that the area coverage achieved by each collaborative detection scheme depends on the distance between the two sensors. When the two sensors are located relatively close to each other, ECD achieves better coverage whereas when the two sensors are spaced further apart, the ED with an OR fusion rule can achieve better results. Therefore, for monitoring applications one can organize the sensors of the field into pairs (e.g., closest neighbors) and each pair will decide its <b>alarm</b> <b>status</b> using the best detection algorithm given their relative distance. The cornerstone of this approach is that closely spaced sensors can take advantage of the possible correlation in their measurements to reduce the false alarm probability and extend their coverage.|$|E

The main objective of this work is to investigate collaborative detection schemes at the local sensor level for increasing the area coverage of each sensor and thus increasing {{the coverage of the}} entire network. In this article, we focus on pairs of nodes that are closely spaced and can exchange information to decide their collective <b>alarm</b> <b>status</b> in a decentralized manner. By exploiting their spatial correlation, we show that the pair can achieve a larger area coverage than the two individual sensors acting alone. Moreover, we analyze the performance of different collaborative detection schemes for a pair of sensor nodes and show that the area coverage achieved by each scheme depends on the distance between the two sensors.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of {{wireless}} sensor networks for multiple event source localization using binary information from the sensor nodes. The events could continually emit signals whose strength is attenuated inversely proportional to {{the distance from the}} source. In this context, faults occur due to various reasons and are manifested when a node reports a wrong decision. In order to reduce the impact of node faults on the accuracy of multiple event localization, we introduce a trust index model to evaluate the fidelity of information which the nodes report and use in the event detection process, and propose the Trust Index based Subtract on Negative Add on Positive (TISNAP) localization algorithm, which reduces the impact of faulty nodes on the event localization by decreasing their trust index, to improve the accuracy of event localization and performance of fault tolerance for multiple event source localization. The algorithm includes three phases: first, the sink identifies the cluster nodes to determine the number of events occurred in the entire region by analyzing the binary data reported by all nodes; then, it constructs the likelihood matrix related to the cluster nodes and estimates the location of all events according to the <b>alarmed</b> <b>status</b> and trust index of the nodes around the cluster nodes. Finally, the sink updates the trust index of all nodes according to the fidelity of their information in the previous reporting cycle. The algorithm improves the accuracy of localization and performance of fault tolerance in multiple event source localization. The experiment results show that when the probability of node fault is close to 50 %, the algorithm can still accurately determine the number of the events and have better accuracy of localization compared with other algorithms...|$|R

The CAAS is composed of numerous detectors, electronics, and logic units. It uses a telemetry system to sound building evacuation horns and to provide remote <b>alarm</b> <b>status</b> in a central control facility. The ANSI Standard for a CAAS uses a free-in-air dose rate to define the detection criteria for a minimum accident-of-concern. Previously, the free-in-air absorbed dose rate from neutrons was used for determining the areal coverge of criticality detection within PORTS buildings handling fissile materials. However, the free-in-air dose rate does not accurately reflect the response of the neutron detectors in use at PORTS. Because the cost of placing additional CAAS detectors in areas of questionable coverage (based on a free-in-air absorbed dose rate) is high, the actual response function for the CAAS neutron detectors was determined. This report, which is organized into three major sections, discusses how the actual response function for the PORTS CAAS neutron detectors was determined.

Entanglements have been implicated in preventing the recovery of some large whale populations. Acoustic deterrents on fishing nets are widely used to reduce incidental captures of dolphins and porpoises, but there is little evidence as to whether they effectively deter large whales. We tested whether a low-frequency whale alarm (3 kHz Whale Pinger®, 135 ± 5 db, 5 s emission interval and 400 ms emission duration) deterred Southern Hemisphere humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae from approaching a potential source of entanglement. Northerly migrating humpback whale pods were tracked by an observer blind to <b>alarm</b> <b>status</b> (on/off) as they passed an alarm moored in the centre of the peak migration path. Of 137 pods tracked, 82 (60 %) passed within the assumed detectable range (500 m) of the alarm, 51 / 78 (65 %) when it was on and 31 / 59 (52 %) when it was off(p = 0. 18). There was no discernible response to the alarm. Whale pods did not differ in directionality, course heading or dive duration when within detectable range of the alarm, whether it was on or off, and a number of pods passed directly over the alarm while it was operational. This suggests that single alarms as currently configured and attached to a trap or pot line are unlikely to effectively deter humpback whales from approaching potential hazards, at least during their northerly migration phase. 8 page(s...|$|E

This data consists mainly of different <b>alarms,</b> <b>status</b> indications and measurements. The target of this thesis was to study the process data and its possibilities for proactive network management. The study for {{the present state of}} process data utilization was carried out from two different perspectives. At first, an exploration was made to the available process data and the processes exploiting it. The studied data sources were substations, automated disconnector stations, remote reclosers and smart meters. The study was complemented by including the user perspective with interviewing the personnel of Elenia. From the interviews, several visions for the improved process data utilization were encountered. These were refined to the functionalities of a novel Proactive Network Management System (PNMS) concept by studying the required initial data and some other boundaries. The functionalities will form a guideline for the system-driven development of proactive network management in Elenia. More thorough analysis of the new functionalities revealed {{that it would not be}} reasonable to implement all of these into a single system; a novel nor an existing one. Some of the functions could be implemented into existing systems with little effort. Some of the functionalities instead require data from multiple locations and may not fit in any of the existing systems. Thus a need for a novel system was verified. Each of the functions requires still more careful evaluation before implementing them into practice. The features of this novel system were also discussed in general. Finally, two of the discovered functionalities, repetitive reclosing analysis and the handling of disturbance records, were studied in more detail. The former represents a functionality which could be implemented in the Distribution Management System (DMS) in use at present. Next, a more detailed specification should be made with the software vendor. The latter would enable the multiple functionalities of which the improved fault analysis was studied the most. To have these functionalities implemented in practice, further research is needed with actual records to verify the potential of each function before rushing into system development...|$|R
40|$|A {{major problem}} with alarm {{processing}} and fault diagnosis in power systems is {{the reliance on}} the circuit <b>alarm</b> <b>status.</b> If {{there is too much}} information available and the time of arrival of the information is random due to weather conditions etc., the alarm activity is not easily interpreted by system operators. In respect of these problems, this thesis sets out the work that has been carried out to design and evaluate a diagnostic tool which assists power system operators during a heavy period of alarm activity in condition monitoring. The aim of employing this diagnostic tool is to monitor and raise uncertain alarm information for the system operators, which serves a proposed solution for restoring such faults. The diagnostic system uses elements of AI namely expert systems, and fuzzy logic that incorporate abductive reasoning. The objective of employing abductive reasoning is to optimise an interpretation of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) based uncertain messages when the SCADA based messages are not satisfied with simple logic alone. The method consists of object-oriented programming, which demonstrates reusability, polymorphism, and readability. The principle behind employing objectoriented techniques is to provide better insights and solutions compared to conventional artificial intelligence (Al) programming languages. The characteristics of this work involve the development and evaluation of a fuzzy-expert system which tries to optimise the uncertainty in the 16 -lines 12 -bus sample power system. The performance of employing this diagnostic tool is assessed based on consistent data acquisition, readability, adaptability, and maintainability on a PC. This diagnostic tool enables operators to control and present more appropriate interpretations effectively rather than a mathematical based precise fault identification when the mathematical modelling fails and the period of alarm activity is high.
