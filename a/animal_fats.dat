HROs are gelatinous at room temperature, but at the high temperatures found in die casting, they form a thin film. Other substances are added to control the emulsions viscosity and thermal properties; these include graphite, aluminium, and mica. Other chemical additives are used to inhibit rusting and oxidation. Emulsifiers are added to water-based lubricants, so that oil based additives can be mixed into the water; these include soap, alcohol esters, and ethylene oxides.|$|E

The flight, performed at Eglin Air Force Base, used a 1:1 blend of JP-8 and Camelina-based fuel. On 28 June 2012, the A-10 became the first aircraft to fly using a new fuel blend derived from alcohol; known as ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet), the fuel is cellulosic-based that can be derived using wood, paper, grass, or any cellulose based material, and are fermented into alcohols before being hydro-processed into aviation fuel. ATJ is the third alternative fuel to be evaluated by the Air Force {{as a replacement for}} petroleum-derived JP-8 fuel. Previous types were a synthetic paraffinic kerosene derived from coal and natural gas and a bio-mass fuel derived from plant-oils and <b>animal</b> <b>fats</b> known as Hydroprocessed Renewable Jet.|$|E
5|$|Potash is {{primarily}} a mixture of potassium salts because plants {{have little or no}} sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789. For a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate. Potassium soaps from <b>animal</b> <b>fats</b> and vegetable oils were especially prized because they tend to be more water-soluble and of softer texture, and are therefore known as soft soaps. The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that potassium is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts. Wood-ash from fir trees was initially used as a potassium salt source for fertilizer, but, with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Staßfurt, Germany, the production of potassium-containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale. Other potash deposits were discovered, and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer.|$|E

A single cylinder direct injection diesel engine developing a power output of 2. 8  kW at 1500  rev/min is tested using preheated <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> as fuel. Experiments are conducted at the fuel inlet temperatures of 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70  °C. <b>Animal</b> <b>fat</b> at low temperature results in higher ignition delay and combustion duration than diesel. Preheated <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> shows reduced ignition delay and combustion duration. Peak pressure and rate of pressure rise are found as high with <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> at high fuel inlet temperatures. Heat release pattern shows reduced premixed combustion phase with <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> as compared to neat diesel at normal temperature. Preheating improves the premixed combustion rate. At low temperature, <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> results in lower smoke emissions than diesel. The maximum smoke density is K= 6. 5  m− 1 with diesel and K= 3. 6  m− 1 with <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> at 30  °C. Preheated <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> further reduces smoke levels at all temperatures. The smoke level is reduced up to K= 1. 7  m− 1 with preheated <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> at the temperature of 70  °C.
