The base model had several options and {{features}} available to be fitted {{to the car}} such as leather seats, ABS, & a viscous limited-slip differential. SE and LE models came equipped with 5-lug, 16-inch alloy wheels, a stiffer suspension than the base model, and a rear sway bar. The LE was basically an upgraded SE model, but with more standard equipment such as leather seats, keyless entry, an <b>antitheft</b> system, and a CD player.

5000|$|After the War was over, poverty {{inspired}} {{people to}} wash off the cancellation from the stamps {{and attempt to}} use them again. The Government then decided to put an <b>antitheft</b> device onto the stamps known as a grill. This grill, which consisted of various rows of tiny indentations into the stamps, {{was supposed to make}} it impossible to wash off the cancellations without being detected; but people usually got around this by bisecting the stamp, and then reusing that portion that didn't have a cancellation on it. The first grill applied to a Black Jack stamp is known as the [...] "Z" [...] grill, introduced in January 1868. Over the next few months, the Post Office successively employed three smaller grill patterns (D, E and F) in the production of this stamp.|$|E
50|$|Rather than a UN-style {{system of}} type approvals, the US and Canadian auto safety {{regulations}} {{operate on the}} principle of self-certification, wherein the manufacturer or importer of a vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment certifies—i.e., asserts and promises—that the vehicle or equipment complies with all applicable federal or Canada Motor Vehicle Safety, bumper and <b>antitheft</b> standards. No prior verification is required by a governmental agency or authorised testing entity before the vehicle or equipment can be imported, sold, or used. If reason develops to believe the certification wasfalse or improper — i.e., that the vehicle or equipment does not in fact comply — then authorities may conduct tests and, if a noncompliance is found, order a recall and/or other corrective and/or punitive measures. Vehicle and equipment makers are permitted to appeal such penalties, but this is a difficult direction. Non-compliances found that are arguably without effect to highway safety may be petitioned to skip recall (remedy and notification) requirements for vehicles already produced.|$|E

Minister Delegate for Social Dialogue, Liviu Pop, {{on the way to}} the government meeting, stopped to talk with protesters and asked them to submit official documents which they have transmitted to the Government with these problems. One of the protesters was chained to the gate of the Government with a steel bicycle <b>antitheft</b> device, that gendarmes tried to cut with a hacksaw blade, but without success. They would then cut device with a flex, but by the station were advised to abandon this idea, because of the risk that the protester can be hurt. Finally, gendarmes requested the intervention of the fire crew, who managed to cut the device with a pneumatic extrication device. On 9 December, simultaneously with the legislative election, took place, in 35 localities in Alba County, a referendum on restarting mining in the Apuseni Mountains.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—There {{are always}} frustrations for drivers in finding parking spaces and being {{protected}} from auto theft. In this paper, {{to minimize the}} drivers ’ hassle and inconvenience, we propose a new intelligent secure privacy-preserving parking scheme through vehicular communications. The proposed scheme is characterized by employing parking lot RSUs to surveil and manage the whole parking lot and is enabled by communication between vehicles and the RSUs. Once vehicles that are equipped with wireless communication devices, which are also known as onboard units, enter the parking lot, the RSUs communicate with them and provide the drivers with real-time parking navigation service, secure intelligent <b>antitheft</b> protection, and friendly parking information dissemination. In addition, the drivers ’ privacy is not violated. Performance analysis through extensive simulations demonstrates the efficiency and practicality of the proposed scheme.

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the advanced technology with wireless use to transfer data, {{for the purposes of}} automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to objects. Message of amount of toll will also be given to owner of the vehicle using GSM. In this paper avoidance of use of Prepaid card is the feature.

40|$|Recently {{fish are}} {{frequently}} stolen, which has seriously influenced agricultural production. On {{the basis of}} analyzing existing aquatic <b>antitheft</b> measures, {{in accordance with the}} advantage of ZigBee and GSM (Global System for Mobile communication), a burglar alarm system was developed.

Except that anti-theft terminals were installed at the fixed point {{on the banks of the}} river, they were also installed on mobile patrol boat, which invested in the fishpond according to the preset trajectory to patrol the fishpond. These anti-theft terminals made up wireless network based on ZigBee.

Theremin discovered that the effects of moving objects on the capacitance of nearby circuits could be used to tune a resonant circuit to different frequencies.

40|$|<b>Antitheft</b> {{security}} system {{security system}} using AT&T COMMAND utilizes an embedded system design with GSM {{to monitor and}} safeguard a car. It secures the car against theft. Upon activation, it automatically demobilizes the car by disconnecting the ignition key supply from the car battery. This now {{makes it impossible for}} anybody so starts the car, let alone moving with it. In an attempt of theft through the car doors or boot, the system sends text message to the car owner {{and at the same time}} starts up an alarm. This design popped out due to the increasing rate at which packed cars are stolen especially in our country, but with this design this packed car is being monitored irrespective of where it is packed, provided there is GSM network coverage. From the research conducted, it was found out that majority of the existing car security system uses only alarm, and doesn’t send text message to the car owner let alone of demobilizing the car. But with the use of GSM network, the owner is guaranteed that the car will send text message to his phone, and at the same time, have people around alerted of what is happening. Added to this is that the car will not be move because it has been demobilized. The use of AT&T COMMAND made the design use very few electronics component, look very small and compact that it can be hardly seen when mounted in the car [2]...|$|E
40|$|Current {{printable}} memory {{technology are}} not suited for mass produc‐tion. With new inexpensive printed memory, {{it will be}} possible to manufacture cheap surveillance tags that are capable to tell the user if something has happened within a timeline. This project is within the ITC FrameProgram 7 founded project PriMeBits. The goal is to imple‐ment a write once read many memory (WORM) onto an RF‐tag together with a sensor that can sense wetness, which can be detected by EAS <b>antitheft</b> systems. Pre researches have been done in the fields printed capacitance, coils and WORMs, all printed with silver ink. Before implementation of a WORM onto a tag simulations and laboratory tests with adjustable resistances were made. Two different circuit models are simulated and tested. When connected to a tag and the WORM is un‐programmed, the EAS system should not trigger an alarm. But if the WORM is programmed by the sensor, the alarm should trigger. Results show that capacitances and WORMs are printable with this technique but coils are not due to high inner resistance. The simulations show that a tag built as an LCCR‐circuit is the best choice. This is also confirmed with tests done with real resistors. With WORMs connected to a tag the results show that approximately 70 % of them work as intended, this is because the WORMs as of now are not completely developed. The conclusion of this project is that it is possible to implement a WORM onto a tag with further research, to make an inexpensive surveillance tag. PriMeBit...|$|E
