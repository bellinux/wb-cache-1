5|$|Between 1772 and 1779, Espejo {{provoked}} the colonial authorities, who regarded him <b>as</b> <b>responsible</b> for several satirical and mocking posters. These posters {{were attached to}} the doors of churches and other buildings, and their anonymous author tended to attack the colonial authorities, the clergy or any other subject he deemed convenient. Although no surviving posters have been found, evidence from comments Espejo made in his writings suggests that he wrote them.|$|E
5|$|In the song, {{the protagonist}} kisses {{different}} lips {{looking for new}} sensations, haunted {{by the memory of}} a past love. The song has experienced popular acclaim, especially with the version recorded by Mexican singer Luis Miguel on his album Romance released in 1991. This version peaked {{at the top of the}} Billboard Top Latin Songs chart in the United States, and the album was deemed <b>as</b> <b>responsible</b> for reviving the bolero genre.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy {{was first}} {{identified}} {{as a form of}} theodicy by John Hick in Evil and the God of Love, written in 1966. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, which is based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, which casts God <b>as</b> <b>responsible</b> for evil but justified in it. The Irenaean theodicy is distinguished by its acceptance that God is responsible for evil, but that he is not at fault.|$|E

5|$|These dates {{correspond}} {{with the end}} of the Battle of Konigsberg, which finished on 9 April with the surrender of the German garrison. A few years later, Brusov publicly voiced a contrary opinion; this is believed to have been done due to pressure from Soviet authorities, who did not want to be seen <b>as</b> <b>responsible</b> for the loss of the Amber Room.|$|E
5|$|Certain genera of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, {{can form}} highly resistant, dormant {{structures}} called endospores. In almost all cases, one endospore is formed {{and this is}} not a reproductive process, although Anaerobacter can make up to seven endospores in a single cell. Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat. Dipicolinic acid is a chemical compound that composes 5% to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores. It is implicated <b>as</b> <b>responsible</b> for the heat resistance of the endospore.|$|E

5|$|In The Acharnians, Aristophanes blames Aspasia for the Peloponnesian War. He {{claims that}} the Megarian decree of Pericles, which {{excluded}} Megara from trade with Athens or its allies, was retaliation for prostitutes being kidnapped from the house of Aspasia by Megarians. Aristophanes' portrayal of Aspasia <b>as</b> <b>responsible,</b> from personal motives, for {{the outbreak of the}} war with Sparta may reflect memory of the earlier episode involving Miletus and Samos. Plutarch reports also the taunting comments of other comic poets, such as Eupolis and Cratinus. According to Podlecki, Douris appears to have propounded the view that Aspasia instigated both the Samian and Peloponnesian Wars.|$|E
5|$|In the marginalia that El Greco {{inscribed in}} his copy of Daniele Barbaro's {{translation}} of Vitruvius' , he refuted Vitruvius' attachment to archaeological remains, canonical proportions, perspective and mathematics. He also saw Vitruvius' manner of distorting proportions {{in order to}} compensate for distance from the eye <b>as</b> <b>responsible</b> for creating monstrous forms. El Greco was averse to {{the very idea of}} rules in architecture; he believed above all in the freedom of invention and defended novelty, variety, and complexity. These ideas were, however, far too extreme for the architectural circles of his era and had no immediate resonance.|$|E
5|$|Radical {{feminism}} {{considers the}} male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression {{and the total}} uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary. Conservative feminism is conservative relative to the society in which it resides. Libertarian feminism conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference. Separatist feminism does not support heterosexual relationships. Lesbian feminism is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist. Ecofeminists see men's control of land <b>as</b> <b>responsible</b> for the oppression of women and destruction of the natural environment; ecofeminism {{has been criticized for}} focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature.|$|E

5|$|Richard's posthumous {{reputation}} {{has been}} shaped {{to a large extent}} by William Shakespeare, whose play Richard II portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition by Bolingbroke <b>as</b> <b>responsible</b> for the 15th-century Wars of the Roses. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had what psychologists today identify as a personality disorder, particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that, even though his policies were not unprecedented or entirely unrealistic, the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment, and this led to his downfall.|$|E
5|$|Shein's army {{retreated to}} its main camp, {{which was in}} turn {{surrounded}} by Commonwealth forces in mid-October. The besieged Russians waited for relief, but none arrived, as Commonwealth and Cossack cavalry {{had been sent to}} disrupt the Russian rear. Some historians also cite dissent and internal divisions in the Russian camp <b>as</b> <b>responsible</b> for their inaction and ineffectiveness (Jasienica blames the Russian warlords, and Parker the foreign mercenaries). The Tatar invasion threatening the south Russian borderlands was a contributory factor, with many soldiers and boyars from those regions deserting the Russian camp to return to protect their homes. Some foreign mercenaries also deserted to the Commonwealth side.|$|E
5|$|Stanford {{composed}} {{a substantial number}} of concert works, including seven symphonies, but his best-remembered pieces are his choral works for church performance, chiefly composed in the Anglican tradition. He was a dedicated composer of opera, but none of his nine completed operas has endured in the general repertory. Some critics regarded Stanford, together with Hubert Parry and Alexander Mackenzie, <b>as</b> <b>responsible</b> for a renaissance in music from the British Isles. However, after his conspicuous success as a composer {{in the last two decades}} of the 19th century, his music was eclipsed in the 20th century by that of Edward Elgar as well as former pupils.|$|E

5|$|Taiwan (Republic of China) {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with the U.S. to purchase 30 AH-64Es with weapons, and associated equipment in June 2011. On 5 November 2013, Taiwan received the first 6 AH-64s. On 25 April 2014, a Taiwanese AH-64E crashed into a three-story building during a training flight in bad weather conditions, the first airframe loss of an AH-64E. An investigation ruled out mechanical failure and concluded human error <b>as</b> <b>responsible,</b> that the pilots descended too fast through clouds at low altitude without checking flight panels to maintain adequate height; the Army responded by stepping up simulator training for pilots. In October 2014, the fifth and final batch of AH-64Es was delivered to Taiwan, completing the order.|$|E
5|$|The {{dusky shark}} is {{considered}} to be potentially dangerous to humans because of its large size, though little is known of how it behaves towards people underwater. As of 2009, the International Shark Attack File lists it <b>as</b> <b>responsible</b> for six attacks on people and boats, three of them unprovoked and one fatal. However, attacks attributed to this species off Bermuda and other islands were probably in reality caused by Galapagos sharks. Shark nets used to protect beaches in South Africa and Australia entangle adult and larger juvenile dusky sharks in some numbers. From 1978 to 1999, an average of 256 individuals were caught annually in nets off KwaZulu-Natal; species-specific data is not available for nets off Australia. Young dusky sharks adapt well to display in public aquariums.|$|E
5|$|The list of Florida hurricanes from 1950 to 1974 {{encompasses}} 85 Atlantic tropical or subtropical cyclones {{that affected}} the U.S. state of Florida. Collectively, tropical cyclones in Florida {{during the time}} period resulted in about $7.04billion (2017USD) in damage, primarily from Hurricanes Donna and Dora. Additionally, tropical cyclones in Florida were directly responsible for 93fatalities during the period, as well <b>as</b> <b>responsible</b> for 23 indirect deaths. Several tropical cyclones produced over 20inches (500mm) of rainfall in the state, including Hurricane Easy which is the highest total during the time period. The 1969 season was the year with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state, {{with a total of}} 8 systems. The 1954 and 1967 seasons were the only years during the time period in which a storm did not affect the state.|$|E

Following the war, the Allies launched an investigation into the escaped prisoners' executions and named seventy-two individuals <b>as</b> <b>responsible.</b> Marcinkus' killer was convicted in 1948. In the same year Marcinkus' burial place was identified and an urn containing his ashes was transferred to the British section of the Old Garrison Cemetery in Poznań, his grave is marked by a Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, Playford and the LCL's {{share of}} the vote {{declined}} continually despite the economic growth, and they clung to power mainly due to the Playmander. Playford became less assured in parliament as Labor became more aggressive, their leading debater Don Dunstan combatively disrupting the previously collaborative style of politics, targeting the injustice of the Playmander in particular. Playford's successful economic policies had fuelled a rapid expansion of the middle class, which wanted more government attention to education, public healthcare, the arts, the environment and heritage protection. However, Playford was an unrelenting utilitarian, and was unmoved by calls to broaden policy focus beyond economic development. This was exacerbated by Playford and his party's failure to adapt to changing social mores, remaining adamantly committed to restrictive laws on alcohol, gambling and police powers. A turning point in Playford's tenure was the Max Stuart case in the 1950s, when Playford came under heavy scrutiny for his hesitation to grant clemency to a murderer on death row amid claims of judicial wrongdoing. Although Playford eventually commuted the sentence under heavy criticism of the judicial review process, the controversy was seen <b>as</b> <b>responsible</b> for his government losing its assurance, and he eventually lost office in the 1965 election. He relinquished the party leadership to Steele Hall and retired at the next election, serving on various South Australian company boards {{until his death in}} 1981.|$|E
5|$|In 1181 Bardulf was at {{the court}} of King Henry II of England, where he was steward, or dapifer, an office he held {{throughout}} Henry's reign and which he may have held throughout the next reign also. He held that office until Henry's death in 1189. From about 1185 until 1203, Bardulf was a royal justice almost annually, usually as a justice of eyre rather than sitting at Westminster. He performed the duties of sheriff for the following counties: Cornwall from 1184–1187, Wiltshire from 1187 to 1189, Somerset during 1188 and 1189 along with Dorset during the same period, the counties of Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Leicestershire during 1190 and 1191, Yorkshire from 1191 to 1194, Westmorland from 1191 to 1199, Northumberland from 1194 to 1198, Cumberland during 1198 and 1199, Cornwall again from 1199 to 1200 along with Devonshire, and Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire from 1200 to 1203. In 1194 Bardulf was mentioned on the escheat roll <b>as</b> <b>responsible</b> for the farm of lands held by Osbert de Bayeux, an archdeacon of York.|$|E
