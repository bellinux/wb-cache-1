5|$|There {{were several}} avenues of appeal {{available}} to the Bali Nine. Lawyers had seven days post-sentencing to lodge appeals. There is no time limit for those convicted to request clemency from the President of Indonesia, but this requires <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> guilt and had never been granted for a drug crime until 2009. All appealed to overturn their sentence. The sentences of Chen, Czugaj, Nguyen, Norman and Stephens stand at life imprisonment and Lawrence's sentence remains at 20 years after appeal. In May 2011, Rush's death sentence was reduced to life after he launched a final appeal in August 2010.|$|E

25|$|Admission of guilt: if a {{declarant}} makes a statement, {{verbal or}} otherwise, as <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> guilt {{of the matter}} at hand, that statement is admissible. Unlike other cases of declarations against interest, the declarant in this situation need not be unavailable.|$|E
25|$|UCLA's {{freshman}} admission rate varies drastically across colleges. For Fall 2016, the College of Letters and Science had <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> rate <b>of</b> 21.2%, the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS) had <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> rate <b>of</b> 12.4%, the Herb Alpert School <b>of</b> Music had <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> rate <b>of</b> 23.5%, the School of the Arts and Architecture had <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> rate <b>of</b> 10.3%, the School <b>of</b> Nursing had <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> rate <b>of</b> 2.2%, and the School of Theater, Film and Television had <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> rate <b>of</b> 4.4%.|$|R

25|$|In 2009, EY, {{the former}} {{auditors}} of Sons of Gwalia, {{agreed to a}} $125m settlement over {{their role in the}} gold miner’s collapse in 2004.

25|$|Balfour {{reached her}} breaking-point when Colville {{tortured}} her daughter. He placed the young girl's hands in thumbscrews, also called pinniewinkles, pulverising the child's fingers.

25|$|Darrow {{had hoped}} that a plea bargain (rather than <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> guilt in open court) would be all that was needed. But Los Angeles {{employers}} were worried that defense attorney Harriman would trounce Mayor Alexander on election day (December 5). Nothing short of an actual admission of guilt in open court would discredit Harriman and prevent his victory, and the employers were pressing hard for one.|$|E
25|$|In the Gujarat {{assembly}} elections held {{later in}} the year, Gandhi was not made {{the head of the}} election campaign. This was seen and regarded by opponents as <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> defeat and was termed as a tactic to avoid blame of defeat. Congress won 57 seats in the assembly of 182, which was 2 less than the previous elections in 2007. Later in bypolls, Congress lost 4 more seats to BJP.|$|E
25|$|In {{the weeks}} before the jury was seated, Darrow became {{increasingly}} concerned about {{the outcome of the}} trial and began negotiations for a plea bargain to spare the defendants' lives. During the weekend of November 19–20, 1911, he discussed with pro-labor journalist Lincoln Steffens and newspaper publisher E.W. Scripps the possibility of reaching out to the Times about the terms of a plea agreement. The prosecution had demands of its own, however, including <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> guilt in open court and longer sentences than the defense proposed.|$|E

25|$|The Apology of Socrates {{begins with}} Socrates {{addressing}} {{the jury to}} ask if the men of Athens (the jury) have been persuaded by the Orators Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus, who have accused Socrates of corrupting the young people {{of the city and}} of impiety against the pantheon of Athens. The first sentence of his speech establishes the theme of the dialogue — that philosophy begins with <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> ignorance. Socrates later clarifies that point of philosophy when he says that whatever wisdom he possesses comes from knowing that he knows nothing (23b, 29b).|$|E
25|$|Mike Pressler, {{the coach}} of the {{lacrosse}} team, received threatening e-mails and hate calls, had castigating signs placed on his property, and was the frequent victim of vandalism {{in the aftermath of the}} accusations. On April 5, 2006, he resigned (later revealed to have been forced) shortly after the McFadyen e-mail became public. Through his lawyer, he stated that his resignation was not <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> wrongdoing on his part. On the same day, Richard H. Brodhead, president of Duke University, suspended the remainder of the lacrosse season.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Flemish {{political}} parties demanded Flanders be given jurisdiction over cultural matters, {{concerned with the}} dominance of the French language in the federal government. Likewise, as Wallonia was in economic decline, Francophone {{political parties}} were concerned with getting economic autonomy for the French-speaking regions to address the situation. The Flemings also feared being in the minority, faced with two other French-speaking regions. They viewed the creation of a separate Brussels region as definitively cutting Brussels off from Flanders, <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> the loss of Brussels to Francization. Essentially, the Flemings had a vision of Belgium with two parts: a Dutch-speaking part and a French-speaking part, whereas Francophones had a vision with three parts: Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia.|$|E

25|$|For {{more than}} a decade since the Bringing Them Home report was {{submitted}} to Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, he and his coalition colleagues consistently rejected calls for a formal government apology, though some coalition government members stated that they were personally sorry for the outcomes of the policy. They were concerned that a formal apology could be construed as <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> deliberate wrongdoing, rather than acknowledging that the originally stated intentions of the government were believed to be {{in the interests of the}} children and their futures. Howard and his supporters were concerned that such an apology would suggest that the government would be admitting liability in any duty-of-care legal proceedings.|$|E
25|$|In response, {{the teams}} {{affiliated}} to FOCA threatened {{to withdraw from}} the race. The organizers of the event, the Real Automóvil Club de España (RACE), concerned that their race was in jeopardy, offered to pay a deposit on the fines owed by the drivers. The FISA refused any payment, unless RACE could prove that the deposit came from the drivers themselves (which would be <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> guilt on the teams part). The King of Spain, Juan Carlos, insisted that RACE proceed with the event, and as a result RACE bypassed the Federación Española de Automovilismo, the Spanish motorsport federation, who were affiliated to FISA. With the race now not sanctioned by FISA, there was no requirement that the drivers hold a FISA racing licence.|$|E
25|$|The 'effective control' {{test for}} {{attribution}} {{established in the}} Nicaragua case is not suitable to questions of State responsibility for international crimes committed with a common purpose. The 'overall control' test for attribution established in the Tadić case is more appropriate when the commission of international crimes is the common objective of the controlling State and the non-State actors. The Court's refusal to infer genocidal intent from a consistent pattern of conduct in Bosnia and Herzegovina is inconsistent with the established jurisprudence of the ICTY. The FRY's knowledge of the genocide set to unfold in Srebrenica is clearly established. The Court should have treated the Scorpions as a de jure organ of the FRY. The statement by the Serbian Council of Ministers {{in response to the}} massacre of Muslim men by the Scorpions amounted to <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> responsibility. The Court failed to appreciate the definitional complexity of the crime of genocide and to assess the facts before it accordingly.|$|E

25|$|As the war {{drew to a}} close, two {{competing}} visions for the post-war world emerged. The first was offered by the International Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU), which called for a meeting in Bern, Switzerland, in July 1919. The Bern meeting would consider both {{the future of the}} IFTU and the various proposals which had been made in the previous few years. The IFTU also proposed including delegates from the Central Powers as equals. Samuel Gompers, president of the AFL, boycotted the meeting, wanting the Central Powers delegates in a subservient role as <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> guilt for their countries' role in the bringing about war. Instead, Gompers favoured a meeting in Paris which would only consider President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points as a platform. Despite the American boycott, the Bern meeting went ahead as scheduled. In its final report, the Bern Conference demanded an end to wage labour and the establishment of socialism. If these ends could not be immediately achieved, then an international body attached to the League of Nations should enact and enforce legislation to protect workers and trade unions.|$|E
500|$|Elazar Barkan {{argues that}} by [...] "forcing <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> war guilt at Versailles, rather than healing, the victors instigated resentment {{that contributed to}} the rise of Fascism." [...] Norman Davies wrote that the article invited Germany [...] "to accept sole guilt for the {{preceding}} war". Klaus Schwabe wrote that the article's influence went far beyond the discussion of war guilt. By [...] "refusing to acknowledge Germany's 'war guilt' the new German government implicitly exonerated the old monarchial order" [...] and more importantly failed [...] "to dissociate itself from the old regime." [...] In doing so [...] "it undermined its claim that post-revolutionary Germany was a historic new democratic beginning deserving credit at the peace conference." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{conviction}} requires proof in one {{of three}} ways. [...] The first is an uncoerced confession. Alternatively, the testimony of two male witnesses can convict (four in the case of adultery), unless it is a hudud crime, in which case a confession is also required. Women's evidence normally carries half the weight of men in Sharia courts, however in criminal trials women's testimony is not allowed at all. Testimony from non-Muslims or Muslims whose doctrines are considered unacceptable (for example, Shia) may be discounted. Lastly, an affirmation or denial by oath can be required. Giving an oath is taken particularly seriously in a religious society such as Saudi Arabia's, and a refusal to take an oath will be taken as <b>an</b> <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> guilt resulting in conviction.|$|E
