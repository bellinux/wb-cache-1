5|$|Alan and Alice <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> {{cabin on}} {{an island in the}} middle of Cauldron Lake. As they unpack, Alan finds that Alice {{arranged}} this trip to try to break his writer's block, scheduling him to see a Bright Falls psychologist named Dr. Hartman and leaving a typewriter in the cabin for him. Alan is infuriated and takes a short walk, but runs back when Alice cries for help. He returns to the cabin just as Alice is being dragged into the lake's waters by a mysterious force. Alan dives into the water after her, blacking out as he submerges.|$|E

In 1998, the first bush {{was found on the}} island—a tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia), which can grow to heights of up to 4metres (13ft). By 2008, 69species of plant had been found on Surtsey, of which about 30 had become established. This compares to the approximately 490 species found on mainland Iceland. More species continue to <b>arrive,</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> typical rate of roughly 2–5new species per year.|$|E

In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E

He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.|$|E

Desiring to see Mulan succeed, Mushu creates a fake order from Shang's father, General Li, ordering Shang to follow the main Imperial Army into the mountains.

5|$|The tremolo call—sometimes {{called the}} “laughing” call—is {{characterized}} by its short, wavering quality. It often uses this call to signal distress or alarm caused by territorial disputes or perceived threats. It emits a tremulous series {{of up to}} 10 rather high notes (hu)-heheheheheheha. It also uses the tremolo to communicate its presence to other loons when they <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> lake, often when they are flying overhead. It is the only vocalization used in flight. The tremolo call has varying three levels of intensities that correlate with a loon’s level of distress, and the types are differentiated by increasingly higher pitch frequencies added to the call.|$|E

Here, Keyes and Lord Hood plan a final effort to stop the Covenant leader, the High Prophet of Truth, from {{activating}} a Forerunner artifact uncovered outside the ruins of the city of New Mombasa. The Chief clears anti-air Covenant defenses so Hood can lead the last of Earth's ships against the Prophet, but Truth activates the buried artifact, creating a slipspace portal which he and his followers enter. A Flood-infested ship crash-lands nearby; Elite forces arrive and vitrify Flood-infected areas of Earth, stopping the threat. Following a message Cortana left aboard the Flood ship, the Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes and their troops follow Truth through the portal.

Then, the player is again moved to the motorcycle sequence, where the game ends.|$|E

After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide.
