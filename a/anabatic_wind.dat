A hill or mountain top will be radiatively warmed by the Sun which in turn heats the air just above it. Air at a similar altitude over an adjacent valley or plain does not get warmed so much because of the greater distance to the ground below it. The effect may be enhanced if the lower lying ground is shaded by the mountain and so receives less heat.|$|E

40|$|Local climate {{processes}} in the Illawarra the climate of the Illawarra apart from that found in Sydney or on the far south coast. Global air circulation Is generated by the necessity to balance the heat surplus at the equator with the deficit at the poles caused by the differential heating effect of the sun with latitude. Superimposed on this general circulation are secondary circulation effects such as high and low pressure cells, cyclones, and fronts. These effects are generated by regional heating or cooling effects over land and water and are controlled in position seasonally by the apparent migration of the sun. On a local scale, air circulation patterns can be generated by differential heating and cooling caused by topographic effects such as mountains, valleys, landsea boundaries and the works of man.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of two-dimensional katabatic and anabatic flows, and their interaction with an urban heat island centred in a closed valley is presented. Down- and up-slope flows are generated via cooling and heating 20 degrees inclined plates. The urban heat island is simulated by an electric heater centred in the valley. In {{order to understand the}} main features of the circulation established by thermal effects in an initially stably-stratified environment, an advanced Lagrangian particle tracking technique (Hybrid Lagrangian Particle Tracking) is employed. This allows one to obtain the velocity and acceleration of passive tracer particles as the first and second derivatives of a moving spline function that filters the particle trajectory coordinates. Experiments show the dependence of mean quantities and turbulent statistics on different slope heating. Furthermore, the effects of the slope flows on the circulation in a large city located in a narrow valley appear significant. During day-time simulations the urban heat island circulation is opposed by <b>anabatic</b> <b>winds,</b> creating critical situations for pollutant dispersion.

The aim of the MandronEX (Mandrone EXperiment) ﬁeld campaign was the collection of useful data to analyse the glacial winds and estimate the mass balance of the glacier. In this study will the data recorded by the 3 axes Gill WindMaster sonic anemometer at a sampling rate of 20 Hz, during the ﬁrst nine days of the experiment will be analysed, in order to detect the glacial winds.

30|$|During the pre-monsoon season, the {{low-level}} large-scale wind over Cambodia is southerly with {{a slight}} easterly component (Fig.  3 b). During the daytime at station C 1, both the sea breeze from the Gulf of Thailand and the <b>anabatic</b> <b>wind</b> to the Cardamom Mountains are southwesterly, so that no clear low-level winds converging to a large-scale southerly are expected. In this situation, the orographic lifting of moist air from the sea caused by the Cardamom Mountains may determine the observed afternoon rainfall. As pointed out by Xie et al. (2006) regarding the abundant rainfall under the ASM over the Indochina Peninsula, moist air is forced to rise over the mountains and thereby initiate intense convection on the windward side of the orographic lifting. The increased atmospheric instability by sensible heat from the drier ground in this season and also by the low-level intrusion of moist air from the sea contributes to the afternoon rainfall maxima and the abundant rainfall on the coast and over the Cardamom Mountains.|$|E

Observations cover the period from MY 26 Ls= 330 {degree sign} to MY 29 Ls= 180 {degree sign} and are acquired at various local times, ranging from 8 AM to 6 PM. Cloud maps of the Tharsis region constructed using the 3. 1 µm ice absorption band reveal the seasonal and diurnal evolution of aphelion clouds. Four distinct types of clouds are identified: morning hazes, topographically controlled hazes, cumulus clouds and thick hazes. The location and time of occurrence of these clouds are analyzed and their respective formation process is discussed. An inverse method for retrieving cloud particle size and opacity is then developed and can only be applied to thick hazes. The relative error of these measurements is less than 30 % for cloud particle size and 20 % for opacity. Two groups of particles can be distinguished. The first group is found over flat plains and is composed of relatively small particles, ranging in size from 2 to 3. 5 µm.

Flights in the boundary layer around the mountain and surface station data indicate that mountain-scale <b>anabatic</b> surface <b>wind</b> generally develops shortly after sunrise, peaking at 1 m s 1 in strength close to solar noon.

30|$|During the post-monsoon season, the {{low-level}} large-scale southwesterly wind withdraws almost entirely, and dry air intrudes to the Indochina Peninsula with a northeasterly AWM flow (Fig.  3 h). The {{situation in}} region N during the post-monsoon season resembles that in region S {{during the summer}} monsoon season, as the daytime lake breeze (southwesterly) converges with the large-scale northeasterly AWM. However, the post-monsoon rainfall amount in region N is even smaller than that in region S, suggesting {{the importance of the}} role of the ASM in transporting abundant moisture from the sea as well as the role of the Cardamom Mountains in initiating rainfall. In fact, even during the post-monsoon season, at the coastal station (C 1) where the AWM converges with a daytime sea breeze and the <b>anabatic</b> <b>wind</b> to the southwestward slope of the Cardamom Mountains, the rainfall amount is large, with the peak occurring in the afternoon. In addition, over region S, the rainfall amount is larger than in other regions in inland Cambodia and most frequent at night when the land breeze and the katabatic wind from the northeastward slope of the Cardamom Mountains converge with the AWM. As Tsujimoto and Koike (2013) demonstrated, a clear nighttime thermal contrast between the lake and the surrounding lands enhanced by the high lake surface temperature is also important for the strong nighttime land breeze circulation associated with the nocturnal rainfall over the southwestern plain.|$|E

40|$|Mesoscale models, {{such as the}} Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, are {{increasingly}} used for high resolution simulations, particularly in complex terrain, but errors associated with terrain-following coordinates degrade {{the accuracy of the}} solution. Use of an alternative Cartesian gridding technique, known as an immersed boundary method (IBM), alleviates coordinate transformation errors and eliminates restrictions on terrain slope which currently limit mesoscale models to slowly varying terrain. In this dissertation, an immersed boundary method is developed for use in numerical weather prediction. Use of the method facilitates explicit resolution of complex terrain, even urban terrain, in the WRF mesoscale model. First, the errors that arise in the WRF model when complex terrain is present are presented. This is accomplished using a scalar advection test case, and comparing the numerical solution to the analytical solution. Results are presented for different orders of advection schemes, grid resolutions and aspect ratios, as well as various degrees of terrain slope. For comparison, results from the same simulation are presented using the IBM. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional immersed boundary methods are then described, along with details that are specific to the implementation of IBM in the WRF code. Our IBM is capable of imposing both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Additionally, a method for coupling atmospheric physics parameterizations at the immersed boundary is presented, making IB methods much more functional in the context of numerical weather prediction models. The two-dimensional IB method is verified through comparisons of solutions for gentle terrain slopes when using IBM and terrain-following grids. The canonical case of flow over a Witch of Agnesi hill provides validation of the basic no-slip and zero gradient boundary conditions. Specified diurnal heating in a valley, producing <b>anabatic</b> <b>winds,</b> is used to validate the use of flux (non-zero) boundary conditions. This anabatic flow set-up is further coupled to atmospheric physics parameterizations, which calculate surface fluxes, demonstrating that the IBM can be coupled to various land-surface parameterizations in atmospheric models. Additionally, the IB method is extended to three dimensions, using both trilinear and inverse distance weighted interpolations. Results are presented for geostrophic flow over a three-dimensional hill. It is found that while the IB method using trilinear interpolation works well for simple three-dimensional geometries, a more flexible and robust method is needed for extremely complex geometries, as found in three-dimensional urban environments. A second, more flexible, immersed boundary method is devised using inverse distance weighting, and results are compared to the first IBM approach. Additionally, the functionality to nest a domain with resolved complex geometry inside of a parent domain without resolved complex geometry is described. The new IBM approach is used to model urban terrain from Oklahoma City in a one-way nested configuration, where lateral boundary conditions are provided by the parent domain. Finally, the IB method is extended to include wall model parameterizations for rough surfaces. Two possible implementations are presented, one which uses the log law to reconstruct velocities exterior to the solid domain, and one which reconstructs shear stress at the immersed boundary, rather than velocity. These methods are tested on the three-dimensional canonical case of neutral atmospheric boundary layer flow over flat terrain...|$|R
40|$|The McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, {{have been}} {{ice-free}} {{for at least}} 10 Ma. In Victoria Valley, {{the largest of the}} Dry Valleys, permafrosted yet still actively migrating dune-fields, occupy an area of 8 km 2 with dune thicknesses varying from 5 to 70 meters. High-resolution ground penetrating radar (GPR) imaging of selected dunes reveal numerous unconformities and complex stratigraphy inferring cycles of sand accretion and deflation from westerly katabatic winter winds sourced from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and <b>anabatic</b> summer <b>winds</b> sourced from the Ross Sea. Samples above permafrost depth were taken for OSL and cosmogenic 26 Al/ 10 Be burial ages. OSL ages from shallow (< 1 m) pits range from modern to 1. 3 ka suggesting that deposition/reworking of the dunes is ongoing and their present configuration is a late Holocene feature. The same 7 samples gave a mean 26 Al/ 10 Be = 4. 53 +/- 5 % with an average apparent continuous 10 Be surface exposure age of 525 +/- 25 ka surprisingly indicating a common pre-history independent of depth. Correcting for minor post-burial production based on OSL ages, the minimum (integrated) burial period for these sand grains is 0. 51 +/- 0. 12 Ma which represents the burial age at the time of arrival at the dune. A possible explanation is that this common burial signal reflects recycling episodes of exposure, deposition, burial and deflation, sufficiently frequent to move all grains towards a common pre-dune deposition history. However, it is unclear over what length of time this processes has been active and fraction of time the sand has been buried. Consequently we also analysed purified quartz aliquots of the same samples for a third and stable nuclide, 21 Ne, to determine the total surface and burial exposure periods. Using the 21 Ne/ 10 Be system we obtain burial ages of 1. 10 +/- 0. 10 Ma. Further coring below permafrost is planned for austral summer 2015. © Copyright, 2015 XIX INQUA Congress LOC...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{parametric}} CFD study on idealized city models to investigate the potential of slope flow in ventilating a city located in a mountainous region when the background synoptic wind is absent. Examples of such a city include Tokyo in Japan, Los Angeles and Phoenix in the US, and Hong Kong. Two types of buoyancy-driven flow are considered, i. e., slope flow from the mountain slope (katabatic wind at night and <b>anabatic</b> <b>wind</b> in the daytime), and wall flow due to heated/cooled urban surfaces. The combined buoyancy-driven flow system can serve the purpose of dispersing the accumulated urban air pollutants when the background wind is weak or absent. The microscopic picture of ventilation performance within the urban structures was evaluated in terms of air change rate (ACH) and age of air. The simulation results reveal that the slope flow {{plays an important role in}} ventilating the urban area, especially in calm conditions. Katabatic flow at night is conducive to mitigating the nocturnal urban heat island. In the present parametric study, the mountain slope angle and mountain height are assumed to be constant, and the changing variables are heating/cooling intensity and building height. For a typical mountain of 500 m inclined at an angle of 20 ° to the horizontal level, the interactive structure is very much dependent on the ratio of heating/cooling intensity as well as building height. When the building is lower than 60 m, the slope wind dominates. When the building is as high as 100 m, the contribution from the urban wall flow cannot be ignored. It is found that katabatic wind can be very beneficial to the thermal environment as well as air quality at the pedestrian level. The air change rate for the pedestrian volume can be as high as 300 ACH. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{high-resolution}} (1 km) numerical simulations with a limited-area numerical {{model has been}} performed over Reunion Island. In the dynamical context of a regular maritime flow perturbed by a major topographic obstacle such as Reunion Island, the objectives are to identify the main atmospheric circulations at local-scale over the island and to improve the understanding of local-scale transport and dispersion of pollutants emitted from local sources. To investigate the effects of topography and land surface heating on low-level flows over the island, simulations representative of austral winter were performed in idealized conditions keeping the radiative forcing plus a background east-south-easterly synoptic flux of varying strengths, typical of the prevailing trade-wind conditions. The numerical experiments show mainly that flow splitting of the trade-wind occurs around the island, with enhanced winds blowing along the coast lines parallel to the synoptic flux, due to the lateral constriction of the flow by the island and resulting Venturi effect. Blocking occurs on the island side facing the trade-wind. The north-western area on the leeside is screened from the trade-wind by high mountains, and this enables the development of diurnal thermally-induced circulations, combining downslope and land-breeze at night, and upslope and sea breeze at daytime. Flow splitting is modulated by radiative convergence toward the island at daytime, and divergence from the island at night. Stronger winds than the large-scale trade-wind occur along the coast at daytime (Venturi effect), whereas at night, the trade-wind flow is pushed few kilometres offshore by divergence of cooled air from the land. At night, the trade-wind flow is pushed few kilometres offshore by divergence of cooled air from the land. Consequently, a number of processes of pollution transport and dispersion have been identified. Vortices {{in the wake of}} the island were found to cause counterflow circulation and trapping of polluted air masses near the north-western coast. These air masses may in turn be sucked by <b>anabatic</b> <b>wind</b> systems during daytime (upslope and sea breezes) in the cirques and up to the summits of the island, and especially to Piton Maïdo (2200 m) where a new observatory of the Indian Ocean background atmosphere is being built. A "cap effect" above the mountains downstream from the volcano (to the south-east of the island), and especially above Piton Maïdo, might occur in case of development of inland and upslope breezes on the west coast. In this case, air pumped from lower layers may protect the observatory from the volcanic plume forced to pass over a "cap" of low-level air clean of volcanic emissions...|$|E
40|$|The {{microclimate}} of the Horotane Valley is characterised {{to enable}} {{an assessment of}} land-use potential in the valley. Crops that are traditionally thought of as marginal or unsuitable for commercial growth on the Canterbury Plains, can be grown successfully in the valley. While {{the residents of the}} valley have a qualitative appreciation of the climate, no quantitative data had previously been collected to characterise the microclimate. Data collection took place over a five month period from 14 th February 1995 to 31 July, 1995. Field observations of maximum and minimum temperature and short-wave radiation are augmented by modelling. Temperature data are used to determine the Growing Degree Day, chill unit and frost distribution. Continuous monitoring of the wind in the upper valley allows analysis of the diurnal and seasonal variation in the wind regime. Radiation receipt varies with slope angle and aspect. Radiation modelling using the "Cosine Law of Illumination" produces comparatively high results as cloud cover, air pollution levels and sky view factors are not taken into account. Albedo varies with the surface colour, roughness and moisture level. Growing degree days initially increase with elevation, until the lower maximum temperatures in the thermal belt counteract the higher minimum temperatures. Chill units decrease with elevation in the thermal belt and then increase again. Frosts are most common on the valley floor and decrease in frequency and severity with elevation up the valley slopes. A temperature inversion is most likely to develop under anticyclone conditions when the nocturnal long-wave emission is at a maximum. Nocturnal temperatures follow the normal lapse rate when the atmosphere is well-mixed. Diurnal temperatures tend to follow the normal lapse rate. Thermotopographically generated winds are prominent in the valley wind regime. The northerly <b>anabatic</b> <b>wind</b> develops in the valley following sunrise. It reaches peak velocity in the afternoon when backed by the low level gradient north-easterly and the sea breeze. A light southerly katabatic flow dominates the nocturnal wind regime. Gradient winds are modified by the valley topography and shelter is needed from the gradient southerly winds as they reach maximum speeds of 15 m/s. The valley is topographically sheltered from winds from an easterly arid westerly direction. Published knowledge of the climatic requirements of selected crops was used to evaluate their suitability to the Horotane Valley microclimate.
