40|$|Abstract: In Cho <b>and</b> <b>Leonard’s</b> {{piecewise}} linear loss function for the larger-the-better quality characteristic, the quality loss is positively and linearly {{proportional to the}} deviation from the lower specification limit (LSL) when the quality characteristic {{is less than the}} LSL. The quality loss is equal to zero when the quality characteristic is {{greater than or equal to}} the LSL. However, the quality loss should be equal to zero when the value of quality characteristic approaches infin-ity for the larger-the-better characteristic. In this paper, we modify Cho <b>and</b> <b>Leonard’s</b> {{piecewise linear}} loss function for measuring the product quality and determine the optimum process mean. Assuming that the quality characteristic follows a Weibull distribution and is larger-the-better, the application of determining the optimum process mean for the modified Cho <b>and</b> <b>Leonard’s</b> model with piecewise linear loss function is discussed...|$|R

5|$|Although cinematographer Clyde DaVinna is {{credited}} with the cinematography, additional footage was shot by George Gordon Nogle, Josiah Roberts, <b>and</b> <b>Leonard</b> Smith. Screenwriter John Lee Mahin claims he shot {{a few of the}} scenes with Eskimo women when coverage was found to be lacking. Numerous days of shooting were lost in the summer when strong sunlight made it impossible to film. To reduce glare from the snow, most of the sets were sprayed with pink paint from the air.|$|E

Only a North American species, B.leucomelaena, branches off from their phylogenetic tree even earlier. However, the relationships between many of the species were not fully resolved in the study, so in the future, new species may be described.|$|E

Within the world of professional music, they were distinguished from each other by the use of the nicknames Bernstein West (Elmer) <b>and</b> Bernstein East (<b>Leonard).</b> They pronounced their last names differently; Elmer pronounced his (BERN-steen), <b>and</b> <b>Leonard's</b> was (BERN-stine).|$|R

5|$|In the 1980s, economists Daniel Khazzoom <b>and</b> <b>Leonard</b> Brookes {{revisited}} the Jevons paradox for {{the case}} of society's energy use. Brookes, then {{chief economist at the}} UK Atomic Energy Authority, argued that attempts to reduce energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency would simply raise demand for energy in the economy as a whole. Khazzoom focused on the narrower point that the potential for rebound was ignored in mandatory performance standards for domestic appliances being set by the California Energy Commission.|$|E

5|$|Pierre Mein <b>and</b> <b>Léonard</b> Ginsburg {{described}} Lagrivea vireti in 2002 in {{a review}} of the ages and faunas of the Miocene fossil sites of La Grive-Saint-Alban in southeastern France. They suggested that it was probably a tree squirrel and related to the Sciurini. Lagrivea belongs to the squirrel family (Sciuridae), which first appears in the Late Eocene of North America and Early Oligocene of Europe. The specific name, vireti, honors Jean Viret for his work on the mammals of La Grive-Saint-Alban.|$|E

5|$|The blue {{stingray}} (Dasyatis chrysonota) {{of southern}} Africa {{has long been}} regarded as {{a variant of the}} common stingray. However, the common stingray lacks the blue markings of the other species and differs in morphological and meristic characters, which led the latter to be definitively recognized as a separate species by Paul Cowley <b>and</b> <b>Leonard</b> Compagno in 1993. The distinction between this species and the similar Tortonese's stingray (D. tortonesei) of the Mediterranean is poorly understood and may not be valid, requiring further investigation.|$|E
