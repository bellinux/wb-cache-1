25|$|The most {{efficient}} separation routine for holmium oxide from the rare-earths is ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are adsorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions {{present in the}} resin.

25|$|The crushed mineral {{is treated}} with hot {{concentrated}} sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3-4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After {{that the solution}} is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Neodymium oxide is separated from other rare-earth oxides by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are adsorbed onto suitable resin by ion exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin.

50|$|Different {{blueprint}} processes {{based on}} photosensitive ferric compounds have been used. The best known {{is probably a}} process using <b>ammonium</b> ferric <b>citrate</b> and potassium ferricyanide. In this procedure a distinctly blue compound is formed and the process {{is also known as}} cyanotype. The paper is impregnated with a solution of <b>ammonium</b> ferric <b>citrate</b> and dried. When the paper is illuminated a photoreaction turns the trivalent (ferric) iron into divalent (ferrous) iron. The image is then developed using a solution of potassium ferricyanide forming insoluble ferroferricyanide (Turnbell's blue identical to Prussian blue) with the divalent iron. Excess <b>ammonium</b> ferric <b>citrate</b> and potassium ferricyanide are then washed away.|$|R
40|$|Starter {{cultures}} for dairy fermentations {{are commonly}} made by anaerobic fermentation in New Zealand. Anaerobic fermentation involves glycolysis {{and it is}} a very inefficient pathway due to the formation of energy rich products such as lactic acid. This pathway only produces 2 moles of ATP per glycolysis and to conserve energy, the amount of biomass produced is less. Aerobic fermentation on the other hand can produce up to 36 moles of ATP per cycle, and the amount of biomass produced will be higher compared to anaerobic fermentation. Lactic acid bacteria do not possess a functional electron transport chain for aerobic respiration to be efficient. It requires the addition of heme, for the electron transport chain to work. The heme addition is a patented process. The aim {{of this study was to}} optimise the aerobic fermentation process for Lactococcus lactis for biomass production. An extensive literature search shows that there has been no study in optimising the heme concentration or using other alternatives for heme. Alternatives to heme, that are food grade, are an attractive option, as there is sourcing issues with heme in New Zealand. A series of shake flask trials were carried out to identify a possible heme replacement. The shake flask trials showed that <b>ammonium</b> ferric <b>citrate</b> is a possible alternative heme replacement. More shake flask trials were then evaluated to optimise the concentration of <b>ammonium</b> ferric <b>citrate.</b> Following that, 1 -L fermenter trials were evaluated to optimise heme concentration and to compare the effect of heme and <b>ammonium</b> ferric <b>citrate</b> addition on biomass and activity of the harvested biomass following a freeze and thaw cycle. It was shown that 44 µg/mL <b>ammonium</b> ferric <b>citrate</b> resulted in the most biomass of the concentrations tested. For heme, the optimum concentration was 1 µg/mL. It was found that fermentations using heme resulted in more biomass after 5 h compared to using <b>ammonium</b> ferric <b>citrate.</b> But, cells grown by adding <b>ammonium</b> ferric <b>citrate</b> was equally as active...|$|R

2500|$|The citrate ion forms {{complexes}} with metallic cations. The stability constants for {{the formation}} of these complexes are quite large because of the chelate effect. Consequently, it forms complexes even with alkali metal cations. However, when a chelate complex is formed using all three carboxylate groups, the chelate rings have 7 and 8 members, which are generally less stable thermodynamically than smaller chelate rings. In consequence, the hydroxyl group can be deprotonated, forming part of a more stable 5-membered ring, as in <b>ammonium</b> ferric <b>citrate,</b> (NH4)5Fe(C6H4O7)2·2H2O.)5Fe(C6H4O7)2·2H2O ...|$|R
