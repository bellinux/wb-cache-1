5|$|The {{film is a}} {{depiction}} of various scenes, usually violent or bizarre, that somehow relate to hunting. Each scenario is presented {{one after the other}} with little regard for narrative continuity. The opening scene introduces a Patagonian hunter who hunts stags to survive. The opening credits play over as he chases after a stag, which he ultimately shoots, kills, and beheads. Afterwards, one of the numerous scenes of <b>anti-hunting</b> gatherings is shown, this one in Cape Cod. The attention quickly shifts to wildlife hunting, where a monkey is killed by a leopard, and then a squirrel monkey by an anaconda. The theme changes again to the social hunt of wild game in Australia and Africa. Aborigines hunt kangaroos and other large marsupials with spears and giant bats with boomerangs. Indigenous tribes of Africa hunt large game, including antelope, buffalo, and elephants, in the savanna. Religious ceremonies are also shown, where the African hunters proceed to suck fresh blood from the entrails of an antelope, and the Australian aborigines symbolically bury their prey in dust to placate the spirits of the animals. Lastly, two brothers are arrested after partaking in a form of ritual post-mortem cannibalism of three of their relatives to acquire the hunting skills of the dead.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anti-hunting</b> campaigners also criticised UK hunts {{of which}} the Burns Inquiry {{estimated}} that foxhound packs put down around 3,000 hounds, and the hare hunts killed around 900 hounds per year, in each case after the hounds' working life {{had come to an}} end.|$|E
25|$|The hunts {{claim to}} provide and {{maintain}} a good habitat for foxes and other game, and, in the US, have fostered conservation legislation and put land into conservation easements. <b>Anti-hunting</b> campaigners cite the widespread existence of artificial earths and the historic practice by hunts of introducing foxes, as indicating that hunts do not believe foxes to be pests.|$|E
5000|$|In 1920, the huntsman logo was introduced. In 2000 Tetley's {{dropped its}} {{traditional}} huntsman logo, due to growing <b>anti-hunt</b> feelings in the UK; the brand instead adopting a rugby ball shaped logo {{in line with}} its heavy sponsorship of rugby league. In 2010 the image was revived. [...] The image however has been simplified from the original. The branding colours have been changed back from blue and yellow (in line with their sponsorship of Leeds Rhinos to the traditional yellow and red.|$|R
50|$|Empikas (warrior delegation) plan a lion hunt {{in advance}} in secret. Only the warriors are {{permitted}} {{to know about the}} day of the hunt. The secret is considered so important that Ilbarnot (young warriors) from the same age-set are denied information regarding the hunt, due to the older warriors fearing discovery from <b>anti-hunt</b> groups. If a warrior is found guilty of spreading rumours, he is punished through beating. In addition, the guilty warrior will be looked down upon throughout his entire age group's cycle.|$|R
40|$|A {{collection}} of 11 papers {{on issues of}} representation, power and identity within the British countryside. Researchers in this area have looked beyond the ideas of tradition, power, order and conformity, to groups who feel themselves to be marginalized or excluded from the dominant ideologies in the countryside, such as New Age travellers, road protestors, <b>anti-hunt</b> groups, smallholders and low-income groups. These papers highlight the initial fruits of this research and attempt to reveal other "rural others"â€”different ideas about the countryside, different uses of rural space, and transgressions of and challenges to notions of mainstream rural lifestyles...|$|R
25|$|An {{application}} for judicial review {{was made to}} the High Court of England and Wales which argued that the <b>anti-hunting</b> legislation contravenes individual human or property rights protected in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and under European Community law and on grounds of the free movement of goods and services. The application was dismissed by the High Court in July 2005, the Court of Appeal in June 2006 and the House of Lords in November 2007. An appeal to the European Court of Human Rights was ruled inadmissible.|$|E
25|$|With the Lords and Commons {{unable to}} come to {{agreement}} {{by the end of}} the Parliamentary year the Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin, invoked the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, an infrequently used legislative device that allows the Commons to overrule the Lords where agreement can not be reached. The Hunting Act was only the seventh statute since 1911 enacted using these provisions. The House of Lords was criticised for undemocratically blocking the legislation; however other newspapers and broadcasters condemned Tony Blair's Labour administration for giving in to what they perceived as the prejudicial views of <b>anti-hunting</b> Labour backbenchers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anti-hunting</b> campaigners long urged hunts {{to retain}} their {{tradition}} and equestrian sport by drag hunting, following an artificial scent. Drag hunting involves hunting a scent that has been laid (dragged) over a course with a defined beginning and end, before the day's hunting. The scent, usually a combination of aniseed oils and possibly animal meats or fox urine, is dragged along the terrain for distances usually of 10 or more miles. However, drag hunting is disliked by some advocates of quarry hunting because the trail is pre-determined, thereby eliminating the uncertainty present in the live quarry hunt and {{because they tend to}} be faster. Supporters contend that while drag hunts can be fast, this need not be the case if the scent line is broken up so that the hounds have to search an area to pick up the line.|$|E
2500|$|The fox is {{sometimes}} referred to as vermin but it is not categorized as such by The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Some farmers fear the loss of their smaller livestock, while others consider them an ally in controlling rabbits, voles, and other rodents, which eat crops. A key reason for dislike of the fox by pastoral farmers is their tendency to commit acts of surplus killing toward animals such as chickens, yet having killed many they eat only one. [...] Some <b>anti-hunt</b> campaigners maintain that provided it is not disturbed, the fox will remove all of the chickens it kills and conceal them in a safer place.|$|R
2500|$|In July 2015, May criticized British prime {{minister}} David Cameron for giving Members of Parliament a free vote on amending {{the ban on}} fox hunting in England and Wales. During a live television interview, he also attacked the pro-hunting organisation the Countryside Alliance as [...] "a bunch of lying bastards" [...] for their support for a change to the law. The vote was postponed by the government following {{the intervention of the}} Scottish National Party's Westminster MPs, who committed to vote to keep the ban as it existed. May told <b>anti-hunt</b> protesters in a rally outside Parliament that it was [...] "a very, very important day for our democracy" [...] but added [...] "we have not yet won the war, there's no room for complacency".|$|R
50|$|This {{left only}} three {{candidates}} {{to run in}} the Democratic primary: Osborn, Sutter and Colter. On September 10, early returns showed Sutter with a slight lead over Colter. With only 29 of 82 statewide precincts counted, Sutter had 772 votes to Colter's 755, with Osborn a distant third with 71. However. by the time 79 precincts had tallied their votes, Colter had pulled into a commanding lead, with the three final precincts to be counted being small. Colter won the Democratic primary in September 1918, garnering 44% of the total votes, 14,539 to Sutter's 10,108 and Osborn's 8,390. In doing so, he won 12 of Arizona's then 14 counties. It was felt that Osborn and Sutter split the <b>anti-Hunt</b> vote, which allowed Colter to win the nomination.|$|R
500|$|Vicky Smith of Horn Book Magazine {{felt the}} novel was gory {{compared}} to the later Disney adaptation and called it a [...] "weeper". While criticizing {{it as one of}} the most notable <b>anti-hunting</b> novels available, she concedes the novel is not easily forgettable and praises the [...] "linchpin scene" [...] where Bambi's mother dies, stating [...] "the understated conclusion of that scene, 'Bambi never saw his mother again,' masterfully evokes an uncomplicated emotional response". She questions Galsworthy's recommendation of the novel to sportsmen in the foreword, wondering [...] "how many budding sportsmen might have had conversion experiences in the face of Salten's unrelieved harangue and how many might have instead become alienated." [...] In comparing the novel to the Disney film, Steve Chapple of Sports Afield felt that Salten viewed Bambi's forest as a [...] "pretty scary place" [...] and the novel as a whole had a [...] "lot of dark adult undertones." [...] Interpreting it as an allegory for Salten's own life, Chapple felt Salten [...] " [...] across [...] a little morbid, a bleeding heart of a European intellectual." [...] The Wall Street Journals James P. Sterba also considered it an [...] "antifascist allegory" [...] and sarcastically notes that [...] "you'll find it in the children's section at the library, a perfect place for this 293-page volume, packed as it is with blood-and-guts action, sexual conquest and betrayal" [...] and [...] "a forest full of cutthroats and miscreants. I count at least six murderers (including three child-killers) among Bambi's associates." ...|$|E
500|$|Another <b>anti-hunting</b> {{demonstration}} {{becomes the}} film's focus, {{this time on}} the Isle of Wight. Nudity and intercourse are practiced freely amongst the demonstrators, and this is contrasted with ancient hunter-gathering groups, who had strict rules concerning nudity. The narrator argues that once hunting had left this group of people, so did their rules toward nudity. Also highlighted is the contradiction that though this people are against hunting, thousands of farm-raised animals had to die to support them. The focus changes to Humboldt penguins, which cannot hunt because of polluted waters, and thus seem detached and without focus. This effect is compared to modern day Eskimos, who no longer hunt since the discovery of oil in their homeland and have fallen into depression and melancholy. To reverse the process, several groups of men go out and revive their hunting ways. Reflected in this is a montage of gun ownership, which the film relates to feelings of masculinity, followed by shots of illegal elephant poaching from Africa. To offset the dwindling number of game due to poaching, warriors from the Lobi tribe celebrate the [...] "Ceremony of Life", in which they masturbate with ceremonial rods and pour the product into the river, hoping the animals will drink the semen and multiply. Attention shifts to large electronic probes in the Peruvian savanna {{used to measure the}} winds of El NiÃ±o for optimal fishing conditions. Fishing birds are also electronically tagged so the prime fishing areas can be located based on the birds' fishing habits. This fish frenzy in South America is reflected in the salmon run in Alaska, where kodiak bears hunt and fight for prey.|$|E

40|$|The studies {{reported}} in this paper address the predictions of the social identity model of deindividuation phenomena, or SIDE (Reicher, Spears & Postmes, 1995), concerning the strategic effects of visibility to the in-group: increasing the visibility of in-group members to each other increases their ability to support each other against the out-group and hence increases the expression of those aspects of ingroup identity which would attract sanctions from this out-group. In a first study, where anti-fox hunting participants were rendered accountable to pro-fox hunters, the results were the opposite of those expected: participants actually decreased their endorsement of <b>anti-hunt</b> disruption (which had been defined as normative for the in-group but unacceptable to the out-group) when made more visible to the ingroup. These results were explained by arguing that participants perceived the intergroup relationship as participants versus experimenters rather than as anti-versus pro-fox hunters and that in-group visibility was being used to resist an experimentally imposed definition of themselves as favouring disruptive activity. This interpretation was supported in a second study where participants' accountability to the pro-fox hunters was removed, leaving them solely accountable to the experimenters, and similar results were obtained. In the final study, the relationship between student participants and staff experimenters was made the explicit topic of study. As expected students increased their endorsement of activities that are normative to students but unacceptable to staff when visible to fellow in-group members. Together these results provide further support for the SIDE model...|$|R
50|$|In October 2007 a 69-year-old Crawley and Horsham hunt supporter, John Hawkins {{was convicted}} at Brighton Crown Court of causing {{grievous bodily harm}} to <b>anti-hunt</b> protestor, Lynn Phillips, by {{striking}} her with his stick and fracturing her arm. In 2008, the Crawley and Horsham hunt launched a legal action in the High Court for trespass, nuisance, and harassment against Simon and Jane Wild of West Sussex Wildlife Protection and West Sussex Badger Protection Group. The hunt used Timothy Lawson-Cruttenden, {{an expert in the}} use of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 in such cases. This was viewed as a test case and received support from the Countryside Alliance, the Master of Foxhounds Association and 80 landowners and if successful was planned to lead to a request for an injunction against everyone associated with these groups from interfering with the hunt. The defendants claimed to have evidence of illegal hunting taking place and were asking the court to accept this as a defence to the Harassment Act action. The original judge, Justice Cranston stepped down in July 2008 due to earlier comments made in support of the ban made while an MP. During the second trial it was reported that the judge dismissed nuisance and trespass, because they had â€œfundamental defects", leaving only harassment. It was also reported that the protestors, using an undercover infiltrator, had been able to get hold of conclusive evidence that the claimants were engaged in illegal fox hunting. The principle plaintiff, Simon Greenwood, was filmed using his hounds to chase a fox to ground and then call in terrier-men to dig it out and throw it to the hounds The plaintiffs dropped the case in July 2009, and agreed to pay costs estimated at over Â£120,000.|$|R

50|$|In early 1918, Sutter {{was once}} again {{approached}} by leaders of the Democratic party to consider running in the Democratic primary for the governorship. He directly confronted the sitting governor over a dispute regarding the I.W.W., which the governor supported, and local mining operators in Bisbee, Sutter's hometown. On {{the floor of the}} legislature Sutter delivered what was considered a very impressive speech condemning the Governor's actions, and supporting the local miners. Sutter went on to successfully curtail Hunt's power to make appointments to the Arizona Council for Defense, the state body responsible for coordinating Arizona projects relating to the war effort. Hunt had been appointing liberal democrats, as he himself was one, to the board. Sutter led a movement which resulted in the number of members of the council was reduced from 50 to 14, one from each county, and any nominee by Hunt had to be approved by that county's board of supervisors. Sutter publicly announced his attention to seek the Democratic nomination in June. By the time the Democratic primary occurred, only three candidates were left: Sidney Osborn, Sutter and Fred Colter. On September 10, early returns showed Sutter with a slight lead over Colter. With only 29 of 82 statewide precincts counted, Sutter had 772 votes to Colter's 755, with Osborn a distant third with 71. However. by the time 79 precincts had tallied their votes, Colter had pulled into a commanding lead, with the three final precincts to be counted being small. Colter won the Democratic primary in September 1918, garnering 44% of the total votes, 14,539 to Sutter's 10,108 and Osborn's 8,390. Post-election analysis felt that the <b>anti-Hunt</b> faction of the party had split their vote between Osborn and Sutter allowing Colter to win the nomination. During the general election, supporters of Colter approached Sutter to request he write a public letter endorsing Colter. Sutter agreed, but with the provision that the letter also include his feelings towards Hunt and the I.W.W. issue. Not wishing the negative publicity, Colter's supporters withdrew their request.|$|R
