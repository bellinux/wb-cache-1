5|$|The {{localization}} {{proved more}} challenging than other Atlus projects for multiple reasons. As the characters' text bubbles {{were designed to}} use Japanese kanji characters—which compress {{a lot of information}} into a single symbol in a way impossible in the English alphabet—each text bubble had to be individually resized and sometimes shifted so they would not intrude on other elements within scenes. The sheer amount of voice acting in the game meant that dubbing took far longer than other similar projects, running past its projected time and requiring Atlus staff members to voice very minor characters to save time. The main characters were a major focus due to the storytelling style of multiple interlinked narratives, with each character's personal growth needing to be reflected in their voice performance. This was particularly true of Mercedes. The auto-scrolling nature of dialogue, which moved <b>along</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> set pace rather than through the player's button prompts, meant that performances needed to be correctly timed and balanced to the varying paces at which the actors read their lines. This led to lines being modified during recording to keep within schedule. During the last stages, the team needed to rerecord some lines of dialogue, but to keep the localization in budget and on schedule it was done outside a professional recording studio, resulting in an audible drop in quality.|$|E

25|$|England {{felt they}} {{probably}} {{still had a}} chance of victory if they could pick up quick wickets, {{and set up a}} low final day run chase, but would otherwise be looking for the draw. Things began brightly for England when Geoff Marsh was caught behind for only 6 off Neil Foster's bowling. But from then on David Boon and Mark Taylor looked determined to put the game out of England's reach, until Taylor was out for a well made 60 leaving Australia at 97 for 2. Captain Allan Border came in and looked determined to lead from the front, scoring at a fast rate, and when Boon was out for 43, Dean Jones emerged from the dressing room looking even more determined. The pair moved <b>along</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rapid rate, taking Australia to 158 for 3 at stumps.|$|E

25|$|Next {{match was}} with Pakistani team, which gave Lankans their first World Cup defeat in home soil. Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi won the toss {{and decided to}} bat first against Sri Lanka, one of the pre-tournament favorites. Sri Lanka got the wicket of Ahmed Shehzad in the sixth over, but Pakistan still managed to proceed <b>along</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rapid run rate in the first ten overs. Mohammed Hafeez, {{proceeded}} along at over a run a ball until a mix up with Kamran Akmal had him run out, and Kamran himself was stumped a few overs later to leave the match evenly poised at 105/3 in the 21st over. Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq then built a 104 run partnership in 20 overs without taking too many risks, until Younis fell to Rangana Herath for 72 while trying to accelerate. Misbah stayed not out till the end for a well made 83, kept Pakistan to 277/7 at the end.|$|E
25|$|Ricky Ponting, {{the next}} man in, {{had a great}} start to his innings, {{creaming}} a boundary off only the second ball he faced. When Ponting had added just six to his tally, Virender Sehwag dropped a chance at third slip off Pathan, and when he reached 12, a close lbw decision against him off Ajit Agarkar's bowling was turned down. Overcoming these hiccups, Ponting strove on further with his innings, reaching his fifty off 64 balls, with a four off Ashish Nehra's bowling, in the 23rd over of Australia's innings. One over later, Langer joined the party, too, amassing 20 runs off Anil Kumble's sixth over with two boundaries and two sixes apiece. However, Kumble {{was to have the}} last laugh, as he trapped Langer, who nevertheless, made a dominating and attacking 58 from a mere 72 deliveries in the fifth ball of the 26th over, when Australia were cruising <b>along</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> run-rate of above five per over. The dismissal occurred shortly before lunch, providing the Indians with a vital breakthrough, but the relief was a short one, as Langer was replaced by Martyn, who proved to be a thorn in the Indian team's flesh. Martyn seemed to be in a graceful touch from his first ball, stroking some good shots to the fence against the pace duo of Agarkar and Pathan, the latter being unable to replicate his good start with the new ball. Just when he seemed set for a big score, Martyn threw away his wicket when he chased a wide ball from Nehra to VVS Laxman. Steve Waugh the next batsman also played a few through the off-side for his 30 before he was bowled by a clever piece of bowling from Nehra. Simon Katich came in at the fall of the fourth wicket at 252, and then he proceeded to add 138 runs for the fifth wicket with Ponting. Katich started slowly, but gained momentum and proceeded to pepper shots all over the wicket once he settled down, the most memorable shot being a six of Nehra. The partnership ended in the 88th over of the Australian over of the day, when he top-edged a pull from Agarkar, only to be caught by a spectacular catch by Sehwag, who came in diving full-length and held on to the cherry with both hands.|$|E

500|$|The King and I was revived at London's Adelphi Theatre on October 10, 1973, {{running for}} 260 {{performances}} until May 25, 1974, starring Sally Ann Howes as Anna and Peter Wyngarde as the King. [...] Roger Redfarn directed, and Sheila O'Neill choreographed. The production, {{which began in}} June 1973 with {{a tour of the}} English provinces, earned mixed to warm reviews. Michael Billington in The Guardian called the revival [...] "well played and well sung". Although he was enthusiastic about Howes as Anna, Billington thought Wyngarde [...] "too fragile to be capable of inspiring unholy terror". He praised Redfarn's production – [...] "whipped <b>along</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> good pace and made a sumptuous eyeful out of the interpolated ballet on 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'." [...] Less favorably, Robert Cushman in The Observer thought the production [...] "scenically and economically under-nourished". He liked Wyngarde's King ("a dignified clown") but thought Howes not formidable enough to stand up to him as Anna. He noted that [...] "she sings beautifully and the songs are the evening's real justification".|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{listed the}} song as the weakest effort on MDNA, adding that [...] "its {{position}} as the album's lead single {{seems to have had}} more to do with showing off the presence of Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. than its featherweight melody." [...] A writer for Virgin Media gave the song three out of five stars, writing: [...] "Like most Madonna singles, it skips <b>along</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> furious pace with a gleam in its eye, but the self-references get tiresome and ultimately she is just trying too hard." [...] Nick Levine, writing for The National, relegated the track as a [...] "lighter pop morsel". Matthew Parpetua from Pitchfork Media panned the song, saying that Solveig's production on the track was paired with equally [...] "bland lyrics". Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice declared that the track was [...] "proof that sometimes you can listen to something many, many times and still not have any idea whether it's any good or not." [...] Chicago Tribune journalist Greg Kot was disappointed with the song and its lyrics, which he found to be meaningless, while Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald relegated it as [...] "trite and disposable".

Tell your friends and neighbors, they're probably {{going to want to}} tune in when this returns after the break.

Total Sci-Fi Online rated the episode 7/10, and expressed the wish that [...] "Safe" [...] could have been used as the series' pilot. [...] "The central premise has more pull, it draws together various plot strands going back to the pilot, meaningfully involves several seemingly incidental characters and events from the past, and zips <b>along</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> better pace. It’s a shame it took this long to reach this part of the puzzle, where a few of the pieces at last click satisfyingly into place".

500|$|Zack Handlen, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, had mixed {{feelings}} about the episode, ultimately rating it a B-. He felt that the character of Virgil Incanto was [...] "wonderfully gross", although he [...] "lacks the universal creepiness" [...] of first season villain Eugene Tooms, from the episode [...] "Squeeze". Handlen also felt that the episode was let down {{by the fact that}} it [...] "takes it as a given that single women are targets", failing to give any real depth to its female characters. An overview of the third season in Entertainment Weekly also rated the episode a B-, and called Incanto a [...] "fine example" [...] of the series' [...] "unassuming" [...] villains, comparing him to Tooms and to the second season villain Donnie Pfaster. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five, calling it [...] "a retread of Squeeze" [...] and [...] "a little too formulaic to be truly satisfying".

500|$|Ico is {{primarily}} a three-dimensional platform game. The player controls Ico from a third-person perspective as he explores the castle and attempts to escape it with Yorda. The camera is fixed [...] in each room or area but swivels to follow Ico or Yorda as they move; the player can also pan the view a small degree in other directions to observe more of the surroundings. The game includes many elements of platform games; for example, the player must have Ico jump, climb, push and pull objects, and perform other tasks such as solving puzzles in order to progress within the castle. These actions are {{complicated by the fact}} that only Ico can carry out these actions; Yorda can only jump short distances and cannot climb over tall barriers. The player must use Ico so that he helps Yorda cross obstacles, such as by lifting her to a higher ledge, or by arranging the environment to allow Yorda to cross a larger gap herself. The player can tell Yorda to follow Ico, or to wait at a spot. The player can also have Ico take Yorda's hand and pull her <b>along</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> faster pace across the environment.
