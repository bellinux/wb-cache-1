5|$|Neepaulakating Creek {{is small}} stream whose {{headwaters}} are located at 640 feet (195 m) <b>above</b> <b>sea</b> level approximately 0.4 miles (0.6km) {{northwest of the}} north end of Lake Neepaulin. These headwaters are located a short distance south of County Route 650 (Libertyville Road) roughly halfway between the hamlet of Libertville in Wantage Township and Sussex Borough. The stream flows into Lake Neepaulin located at 509ft (155 m) <b>above</b> <b>sea</b> level. The man-made lake, created through damming, is the centre of a private residential development. It flows southeast from the lake's dam in the southeast direction for another 1.5 miles (2.4km) before flowing into Papakating Creek. It enters Papakating Creek at 395 feet (120 m) <b>above</b> <b>sea</b> level approximately 2.5 miles (4km) upstream of that creek's junction with the Wallkill River at a location directly south of Sussex Borough along County Route 565 near the hamlet of Lewisburg in Wantage Township and near Sussex Airport.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma {{is between}} the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau in the Gulf of Mexico watershed, {{generally}} sloping from the high plains of its western boundary to the low wetlands of its southeastern boundary. Its highest and lowest points follow this trend, with its highest peak, Black Mesa, at 4,973 feet (1,516m) <b>above</b> <b>sea</b> level, situated near its far northwest corner in the Oklahoma Panhandle. The state's lowest point is on the Little River near its far southeastern boundary {{near the town of}} Idabel, Oklahoma, which dips to 289 feet (88m) <b>above</b> <b>sea</b> level.|$|E

5|$|The Devonian and Silurian {{rocks are}} {{generally}} more resistant to weathering than the limestone, and form {{some of the highest}} points on the hills, including the highest at Beacon Batch on Black Down, 325metres (1068ft) <b>above</b> <b>sea</b> level. Black Down is a moorland area, with its steeper slopes covered in bracken (Pteridium) and its flatter summit in heather (Calluna) and grasses rather than the pasture which covers much of the plateau. The main body of the range is an extended plateau, 6–8km (4–5miles) wide and generally about 240metres (800ft) <b>above</b> <b>sea</b> level.|$|E
5|$|From the Sea of Marmara, {{the wall}} turns sharply to the northeast, {{until it reaches}} the Golden Gate, at about 14m <b>above</b> <b>sea</b> level. From there and until the Gate of Rhegion the wall follows {{a more or less}} {{straight}} line to the north, climbing the city's Seventh Hill. From there the wall turns sharply to the northeast, climbing up to the Gate of St. Romanus, located near the peak of the Seventh Hill at some 68m <b>above</b> <b>sea</b> level. From there the wall descends into the valley of the river Lycus, where it reaches its lowest point at 35m <b>above</b> <b>sea</b> level. Climbing the slope of the Sixth Hill, the wall then rises up to the Gate of Charisius or Gate of Adrianople, at some 76m height. From the Gate of Adrianople to the Blachernae, the walls fall to a level of some 60 m. From there the later walls of Blachernae project sharply to the west, reaching the coastal plain at the Golden Horn near the so-called Prisons of Anemas.|$|E
