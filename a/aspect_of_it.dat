5|$|Supernatural forces pervaded Maya life, and {{influenced}} every <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> {{from the}} simplest day-to-day {{activities such as}} food preparation, to trade, politics, and elite activities. Maya deities governed {{all aspects of the}} world, both visible and invisible. The Maya priesthood was a closed group, drawing its members from the established elite; by the Early Classic they were recording increasingly complex ritual information in their hieroglyphic books, including astronomical observations, calendrical cycles, history and mythology. The priests performed public ceremonies that incorporated feasting, bloodletting, incense burning, music, ritual dance, and, on certain occasions, human sacrifice. During the Classic period, the Maya ruler was the high priest, and the direct conduit between mortals and the gods. It is highly likely that, among commoners, shamanism continued in parallel to state religion. By the Postclassic, religious emphasis had changed; there was an increase in worship of the images of deities, and more frequent recourse to human sacrifice.|$|E

25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then all of a sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E
25|$|He {{worked for}} three years in his father's cigar factory. He disliked the work, {{especially}} the sales <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and resolved to leave, with or without his father's blessing. In early 1898 he took a class in writing {{at one of the}} country's first correspondence schools, the Cosmopolitan University. This was to be the entirety of Mencken's formal education in journalism, or in any other subject. Upon his father's death a few days after Christmas in the same year, the business reverted to his uncle, and Mencken was free to pursue his career in journalism. He had applied in February 1899 to the Morning Herald newspaper (which became the Baltimore Morning Herald in 1900) and had been hired as a part-timer there, but still kept his position at the factory for a few months. In June he was hired as a full-time reporter.|$|E

Fincher recalled of the encounter: [...] "The ballistic, ripping-yarn thriller <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is kind of a red herring in a weird way. It is the thing that throws Salander and Blomkvist together, but it is their relationship you keep coming back to. I was just wondering what 350 pages Zaillian would get rid of." [...] Because Zaillian was already cultivating the screenplay, the director avoided interfering. After a conversation, Fincher was comfortable [...] "they were headed in the same direction".|$|E

I'm a fan of violence and I'm always trying to find a way to make it OK." [...] While being interviewed Piliero spoke of the collaboration with Kesha, explaining her point of view on the video, [...] "Before we started filming, we had quite a few talks. She was adamant you can't back away from the crazy; everything about the idea she loved and she enforced the fact that she wanted to embrace every <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and really go for it, On set, she was having fun. She was like, 'I want to lick a unicorn.' It was rad working with her because there definitely wasn't a sense of her feeling awkward about stuff or detached; no ego. It felt like we had worked together before." ...|$|E

[...] The stage was designed by Mark Fisher, saying [...] "She wanted to have a book opening and herself come out of it. So I finessed that book into the video screen." [...] Fisher explained, [...] "Each different scene in the show would be akin to turning the pages in this book, and all the albums that she'd done in the past—Control, Rhythm Nation, janet.—would be represented."

[...] "And of course, the entirely cool and wonderful and breaking-new-ground <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is that it's all made possible by a thin LED screen."

I kept that in mind while lighting each different scene, but I tried to do it in an abstract way, without jumping too far away from the overall look of the show." ...|$|E
