5|$|A {{military}} station, {{operated by}} the Royal Air Force and later the United States Navy, was opened on part of Home Farm close to the parish boundary with Ruislip in 1917, later becoming known as RAF West Ruislip. The site was used originally for the British No. 4 Maintenance Unit, together with the RAF Records division. It {{became involved in the}} repair of <b>aircraft</b> <b>equipment</b> and later in the servicing of American vehicles from RAF South Ruislip. Between 1955 and 1975 the United States Air Force was based at the Ruislip station, before the U.S. Naval Activities, United Kingdom command leased the site from the Ministry of Defence for the American Naval Exchange.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, both ships were fitted with a degaussing coil to protect them against magnetic mines. Leipzig had her <b>aircraft</b> <b>equipment</b> removed in 1941, along with her after torpedo tubes. In 1942, Nürnbergs aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were also removed. Throughout the war, the ships' radar suites were upgraded; in March 1941, Nürnberg was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 radar set was installed. The latter was a search radar for surface targets and low-flying aircraft at low range. The FuMO 21 set {{was replaced by the}} short-range FuMO 63 Hohentwiel 50-centimeter radar. Nürnberg was also fitted with four Metox radar warning receivers. Leipzig did not receive her FuMO 24/25 radar set until 1943; this was to be the last modification for Leipzig.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil War, all <b>aircraft,</b> <b>equipment,</b> materiel, and {{facilities}} belonging to the Liberian Air Force were badly damaged, rendering the force inoperable. During the Civil War the Taylor government made a variety of different air support arrangements; a seemingly inoperable Mil Mi-2 and Mil Mi-8, one in Anti-Terrorist Unit markings, could be seen at Spriggs Payne Airport in central Monrovia in mid-2005, apparently a hangover from the war. Meanwhile, during the Taylor era, the Navy consisted of a couple of small patrol craft. However, on shore, both late 1990s and 2005 sources indicate the Navy included the 2nd Naval District, Buchanan, the 3rd Naval District, Greenville, and the 4th Naval District, Harper.|$|E
5|$|Kirov was {{completely}} overhauled from 1949 to 1953. Her secondary armament was upgraded with electrically powered, fully automated 100mm B-34USM mountings and her fire-control system {{was replaced with}} a Zenit-26 system with SPN-500 stabilized directors. All of her light AA guns were replaced with nine twin gun water-cooled 37mm V-11 mounts. All of her radars were replaced with Soviet systems: Rif surface search, Gyuys air search, Zalp surface gunnery and Yakor' anti-aircraft gunnery radars. All anti-submarine weapons, torpedo launchers, <b>aircraft</b> <b>equipment</b> and boat cranes were removed. While expensive, about {{half the cost of}} a new Project 68bis , it was deemed a success and allowed Kirov to serve for another two decades.|$|E
50|$|Investigators became {{concerned}} {{that there might}} be more faults in the aircraft. The investigation further revealed that there were some serious malfunctions in the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>equipment.</b> The botched solder work found in the equipment was carried out partly during its production and partly during the repair.|$|R

The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission has placed three cast aluminum markers—Clinton County, Fort Reed, and Pennsylvania Canal (West Branch Division)—in Lock Haven to commemorate historic places. The Water Street District, a mix of 19th- and 20th-century architecture near the river, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Memorial Park Site 36Cn164, an archaeological site of prehistoric significance discovered near the airport, was added to the National Register in 1982.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Brazilian and Russian {{authorities}} conducted {{talks on}} the possible acquisition of the Su-27M. In 2001, the Brazilian government launched the F-X tender, the objective of which was to procure at least twelve aircraft to replace the Brazilian Air Force's ageing aircraft, primarily the Mirage IIIs. Since the Brazilian government was also looking to develop the country's aerospace and defence industries, Sukhoi partnered with the Brazilian defence contractor Avibras during the tender. The two companies submitted the Su-27M to the US$700-million tender, and included an offset agreement wherein the Brazilian industry would participate in the manufacturing of certain <b>aircraft</b> <b>equipment.</b> The tender was suspended in 2003 because of domestic political issues and then scrapped in 2005, pending the availability of new fighters. The Su-27M was preferred over the next favourite, the Mirage 2000BR; had the aircraft been purchased, {{it would have been}} the first heavy fighter delivered to Latin America.|$|E
5|$|The BPF was tasked {{to attack}} Japanese airfields in the Sakishima Islands and Formosa {{before and during}} {{the early stages of the}} {{invasion}} of Okinawa. Unicorn was primarily engaged in preparing aircraft for issue to the operational squadrons aboard the fleet carriers during this time, rather than repair them, but she did repair, modify or service 105 aircraft in March–May 1945. The ship sailed for Australia on 22 May and arrived in Sydney on 1 June. She sailed for Brisbane on 6 June to have her bottom cleaned at the Cairncross Dockyard and to load more replacement aircraft. Unicorn arrived at Manus on 22 July to prepare for operations off Japan. She was still there when Japan surrendered on 15 August. The ship began to ferry <b>aircraft,</b> <b>equipment</b> and men back to Australia after the surrender, a task which ended on 6 November, when she arrived at Sydney. Unicorn departed for home in December 1945 and arrived in Plymouth in January 1946. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve.|$|E

5|$|No.81 Wing re-formed at Williamtown on 2February 1987. Along with No.75 Squadron at Tindal, its flying units {{consisted}} of Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons based at Williamtown with No.2 OCU, {{all of which}} had converted from the Mirage to the Hornet between 1985 and 1987, the last-mentioned being the prime operator of the two-seat F/A-18B trainers. Having continued to perform fighter maintenance through the 1960s and '70s, No.481 Squadron disbanded on 31January 1987. It re-formed the next day as No.481 Wing under No.81 Wing's parent organisation, Tactical Fighter Group (TFG), and {{consisted of}} two squadrons, Aircraft Maintenance Squadron Williamtown (AMSWLM) and <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Equipment</b> Maintenance Squadron Williamtown (AEMSWLM). By 1996, No.81 Wing had been augmented by Nos.25 and 76 Squadrons, operating Macchi MB-326 lead-in fighters, the former based at RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, and the latter at Williamtown, where it also employed Pilatus PC-9s for forward air control (FAC). On 1July 1996, No.481 Wing was reorganised as No.402 Wing, incorporating a newly re-formed No.481 Squadron as well as Weapon Systems Support Flight and Field Training Flight. No.402 Wing transferred its functions to No.81 Wing's flying squadrons on 31July 1998 before disbanding in October. The same year, No.25 Squadron was split, its Macchis now being operated by a re-formed No.79 Squadron. No.78 Wing was re-established in 2000 as an operational training formation, taking over Nos.76 and 79 Squadrons, and No.2 OCU. By 2007, No.2 OCU {{had returned to the}} control of No.81 Wing.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} {{aircraft}} in the IAF has been decreasing from the late 1990s due to retirement of older aircraft and several crashes. To deal with the depletion of force levels, the IAF has started to modernise its fleet.

As new aircraft enter service and numbers recover, the IAF plans to have a fleet of 42 squadrons.|$|E
25|$|When the Air Corps {{began to}} lay its plans for {{expansion}} {{in the fall of}} 1938, one of its major tasks was the provision of facilities for the additional thousands of men to be trained in (1) basic military courtesies, customs and traditions, to include classification of personnel for advanced training. (2) Flying and flight crew operations of military aircraft, and (3) the technical training necessary for the even larger numbers of men to be taught to service and maintain aircraft and <b>aircraft</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E

25|$|Car {{production}} was initially suspended in September 1939 following {{the outbreak of}} war in Europe, but was later resumed and production of the 12/70, Crested Eagle, Speed 25, and 4.3Litre continued well into 1940. The car factory was severely damaged on 14 November 1940 {{as a result of}} several bombing raids on Coventry by the German Luftwaffe, although ironically the armaments factory suffered little damage. Much valuable cutting gear and other equipment was lost and car {{production was}} suspended {{for the duration of the}} war, only resuming during the latter part of 1946. Despite this, Alvis carried out war production on aircraft engines (as sub-contractor of Rolls-Royce Limited) and other <b>aircraft</b> <b>equipment</b> in its shadow factories.|$|E
25|$|Anders briefly {{served as}} {{a fellow of the}} American Enterprise Institute, then joined General Electric in September 1977. As Vice President and General Manager of GE's Nuclear Products Division in San Jose, California, he was {{responsible}} for the manufacture of nuclear fuel, reactor internal equipment, and control and instrumentation for GE boiling-water reactors at facilities located in San Jose and Wilmington, North Carolina. He also oversaw GE's partnership with Chicago Bridge and Iron for making large steel pressure vessels in Memphis, Tennessee. In August 1979, Anders began attending Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program. On the first day of 1980, Anders was appointed General Manager of the GE <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Equipment</b> Division. Headquartered in Utica, New York, the division included more than 8,500 employees in five locations in the northeastern U.S. Its products included aircraft flight and weapon control systems, cockpit instruments, aircraft electrical generating systems, airborne radars and data processing systems, electronic countermeasures, space command systems, and aircraft/surface multi-barrel armament systems.|$|E
