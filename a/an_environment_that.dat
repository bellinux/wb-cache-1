5|$|Today, vector {{spaces are}} applied {{throughout}} mathematics, science and engineering. They are the appropriate linear-algebraic notion {{to deal with}} systems of linear equations; offer a framework for Fourier expansion, which is employed in image compression routines; or provide <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> {{can be used for}} solution techniques for partial differential equations. Furthermore, vector spaces furnish an abstract, coordinate-free way of dealing with geometrical and physical objects such as tensors. This in turn allows the examination of local properties of manifolds by linearization techniques. Vector spaces may be generalized in several ways, leading to more advanced notions in geometry and abstract algebra.|$|E
5|$|By August 15, {{convection}} {{began to}} consolidate around {{the center of}} the system as it passed over the Florida Keys. Early on August16, the system rapidly organized, with a low-level circulation developing roughly 80mi (130km) southwest of Tampa, Florida. Favorable environmental conditions led to the NHC anticipating the system to develop into a tropical depression later that day. Several hours later, the first advisory was issued on Tropical Depression Four. Low wind shear provided <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> promoted quick development of the cyclone and the storm was forecast to attain tropical storm status within 12 hours. The depression tracked northwest around the periphery of a subtropical ridge to the east. Around 11:00am EDT, the NHC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Claudette in light of information from the NEXRAD Doppler weather radar in Tallahassee, Florida that found winds of 40mph (65km/h) around the center of circulation.|$|E
5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the purpose of fungal bioluminescence is to attract arthropods to the fruit body to help disseminate spores. However, there has been no direct observation of this phenomenon. In many species, the mycelium is luminescent, but the fruit body is not, which argues against this hypothesis. Mycelial bioluminence may also function to attract animals that can potentially carry fungal spores in well-hydrated areas, as light emission from the mycelium is higher when it is hydrated. This would presumably increase the chance that spores would be deposited in <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> is already optimal for growth. Basidiomycete mushrooms are known to be dependent on an adequate moisture supply for proper development. In species with a luminous mycelium, the mycelium would therefore have a dual function in performing the fungal translocation that permits transport of substances from the further environment back to the fruiting body, and in attracting disseminating vectors towards environments favorable for development of the species.|$|E
5|$|The first Native Americans {{to become}} Orthodox were the Aleuts living {{in contact with}} Siberian fur traders in the mid 18th century. They had been baptized mostly by their Orthodox trading {{partners}} or during occasional visits by priests serving aboard exploring vessels of the Russian navy. Russian colony in Alaska was established in 1784 by merchant Grigory Shelikhov. Shelikhov's attempt to colonize Kodiak Island was met with resistance by the native population. He returned to Russia and installed Alexandr Baranov {{as director of the}} colony. In order to convince the Russian imperial court of the seriousness of his colonial ambitions, Shelikhov recruited volunteers from the Valaam, <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> appears strikingly similar to the Kodiak archipelago's landscape, and Konevitsa monasteries to travel to the new colony.|$|E
5|$|Her parents, Franciszek Ksawery Plater and Anna von der Mohl (Anna z Mohlów), {{divorced}} {{when she was}} nine years old, in 1815. She was brought up by distant relatives, Michał Plater-Zyberk and Izabela Helena Syberg zu Wischling, in their family's manor Līksna near Daugavpils (Dźwina), then Inflanty (now Latvia). Well-educated, Plater was brought up to appreciate the efforts of Tadeusz Kościuszko and the Prince Józef Poniatowski. She was fascinated by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, who she could read in the original German language. She was raised in <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> valued the history of Poland, and her literary heroes included Princess Wanda and Adam Mickiewicz's Grażyna. She also admired Bouboulina, a woman who {{became one of the}} icons of the Greek uprising against the Ottomans, a Polish fighter Anna Dorota Chrzanowska, as well as Joan of Arc. These pursuits were accompanied by an early interest in equestrianism and marksmanship, quite uncommon for early 19th-century girls from aristocratic families. She was also deeply interested in Ruthenian and Belarusian folk culture. She had contacts and friends in the Filaret Association.|$|E
