5|$|Bennett {{received}} honorary {{degrees from}} the universities of Cambridge (1867) and Oxford (1870). The Philharmonic Society awarded him its Beethoven gold medal in 1867. In 1871 he was knighted by Queen Victoria (two years after his old antagonist Costa had been accorded the same honour), and in 1872 he received a public testimonial before a large <b>audience</b> <b>at</b> St James's Hall, London. The money subscribed at this event founded a scholarship and prize at the RAM, which is still awarded. An English Heritage blue plaque has been placed at the house in 38 Queensborough Terrace, London, where Bennett lived during many of his later years.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Harcourt Williams, newly {{appointed}} {{as director of}} productions at the Old Vic, invited Gielgud to join the company for the forthcoming season. The Old Vic, in an unfashionable area of London south of the Thames, was run by Lilian Baylis to offer plays and operas to a mostly working-class <b>audience</b> <b>at</b> low ticket prices. She paid her performers very modest wages, but the theatre was known for its unrivalled repertory of classics, mostly Shakespeare, and Gielgud {{was not the first}} West End star to take a large pay cut to work there. It was, in Morley's words, the place to learn Shakespearean technique and try new ideas.|$|E

He remained highly popular with the ethnic Chinese.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{there were four}} notable Christian heavy metal groups: Messiah Prophet, Leviticus, Saint, and Stryper. Although it is {{debatable}} as to which band was formed first, the Orange County native glam metal group Stryper {{was the most popular}} one. Stryper was also the first band to identify as Christian metal. Stryper gained attention with their way of throwing Bibles to the <b>audience</b> <b>at</b> their concerts. In the beginning, mostly Christians went to Stryper's concerts but soon they reached non-Christian audience. In the 1980s, Christian metal bands closely followed the trends of mainstream metal bands.|$|E
5|$|The Somali Civil War {{spread through}} the country during 1990 and {{late in the year}} there was an {{increasing}} level of criminal violence in Mogadishu. By December, the security situation began to deteriorate significantly and on December 5, Ambassador Bishop told an <b>audience</b> <b>at</b> a standing-room only meeting that he was recommending the voluntary evacuation of all dependents (i.e. children and spouses of diplomatic staff) and non-essential personnel. By December 19, the number of official US personnel in the city was reduced from 147 to 37 and of the 90 private Americans in the city, half were estimated to have left. Small-arms fire became a daily occurrence and stray bullets and shells were landing in the embassy complex.|$|E
5|$|The movie {{industry}} {{was born in}} Paris when Auguste and Louis Lumière projected the first motion picture for a paying <b>audience</b> <b>at</b> the Grand Café on 28 December 1895. Many of Paris's concert/dance halls were transformed into cinemas when the media became popular beginning in the 1930s. Later, most of the largest cinemas were divided into multiple, smaller rooms. Paris's largest cinema room today is in the Grand Rex theatre with 2,700 seats.Big multiplex cinemas have been built since the 1990s. UGC Ciné Cité Les Halles with 27 screens, MK2 Bibliothèque with 20 screens and UGC Ciné Cité Bercy with 18 screens are among the largest.|$|E

5|$|The single reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on September 27, 1910.

The film would also be shown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and was met with praise by the <b>audience</b> <b>at</b> the Province Theatre. In 1917, years after the film's release, the film was approved without censorship by the Pennsylvania State Board of Censors of Moving Pictures.|$|E
5|$|Though {{originally}} set to an Italian libretto, Orfeo ed Euridice owes much to {{the genre}} of French opera, particularly in its use of accompanied recitative and a general absence of vocal virtuosity. Indeed, twelve years after the 1762 premiere, Gluck re-adapted the opera to suit the tastes of a Parisian <b>audience</b> <b>at</b> the Académie Royale de Musique with a libretto by Pierre-Louis Moline. This reworking was given the title Orphée et Eurydice, and several alterations were made in vocal casting and orchestration to suit French tastes.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{exterior}} shots were always filmed {{on location in}} Holmfirth and the surrounding countryside, the interior shots were, until the early 1990s, filmed {{in front of a}} live studio <b>audience</b> <b>at</b> BBC Television Centre in London. The amount of location work increased, however, as studio work became a drain on time and money. Under Alan J. W. Bell, Last of the Summer Wine became the first comedy series {{to do away with the}} live studio audience, moving all of the filming to Holmfirth. The episodes were filmed and then shown to preview audiences, whose laughter was recorded and then mixed into each episode's soundtrack to provide a laugh track and avoid the use of canned laughter.|$|E

After an unsuccessful short stay at Black-Foxe, Wilder returned home and became increasingly involved with the local theatre community. He performed {{for the first time in}} front of a paying <b>audience</b> <b>at</b> age 15, as Balthasar (Romeo's servant) in a production of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the {{disintegration}} of the Soviet Union, Sukhoi had been demonstrating the Su-27M to senior defence and government officials. With its debut to a Western <b>audience</b> <b>at</b> the 1992 Farnborough Airshow, the company redesignated the aircraft as Su-35. The aircraft subsequently made flying demonstrations overseas in an effort to attract export orders, starting in November 1993 with Dubai, where Viktor Pugachev flew it in a mock aerial engagement with an Su-30MK in front of spectators. The aircraft thereafter flew in Berlin and Paris, and would be a regular feature at Moscow's MAKS Air Show. The Russian government cleared the aircraft for export during Sukhoi's unsuccessful sales campaign in South Korea during the late 1990s and early 2000s; the company also marketed the aircraft to Brazil, China and the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
5|$|Director Brad Bird {{wanted to}} open the episode with a close up of Krusty's face. The staff liked the idea and he then {{suggested}} that all three acts of the episode, defined by {{the placement of the}} commercial breaks, should begin with a close up shot. Act one begins with Krusty's face introducing the <b>audience</b> <b>at</b> his show, act two begins with Krusty's face being locked up behind bars, and act three begins with Sideshow Bob's face on a big poster. Krusty's character is based on a television clown from Portland, Oregon, called Rusty Nails, whom The Simpsons creator Matt Groening watched while growing up in Portland. The original teleplay, written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, was 78 pages long and many scenes had to be cut. One scene that had to be cut down was the scene where Patty and Selma show the slideshow of their vacation; it originally contained images of them being detained for bringing heroin into America.|$|E
