50|$|<b>Arbalester</b> is a {{scrolling}} shoot 'em up arcade game {{released by}} SETA in , licensed to Taito and Romstar. The player controls a fighter jet and shoots {{enemies in the}} air and on the ground, collects power-ups, and defeats bosses to advance levels.|$|E
50|$|But don Rumata {{still held}} on. He managed {{to save a}} few {{scientists}} and his only local friend, Baron Pampa, before a devastating tragedy happened. Kira, a local girl he loved, was mercilessly assassinated by an unidentified <b>arbalester,</b> presumably sent by Reba. If it were indeed so, then it was Rebas last mistake. Rumata stormed Rebas residence, killed the guards and Reba the Bishop of Arkanar before the progressor control center (located on the South Pole) managed to stop him by dropping soporific charges on the city and evacuated him to the Earth.|$|E
50|$|The arbalest (also arblast) was a late {{variation}} of the crossbow coming into use in Europe during the 12th century. A large weapon, the arbalest had a steel prod ("bow"). Since the arbalest was much larger than earlier crossbows, {{and because of the}} greater tensile strength of steel, it had a greater force. However, the greater draw weight was offset by the smaller powerstroke, which limited its potential in fully transferring the energy into the crossbow bolt. The strongest windlass-pulled arbalests could have up to 22 kN (5000 lbf) of force and be accurate up to 100 m. A skilled arbalestier (<b>arbalester)</b> could loose two bolts per minute.|$|E
2500|$|Cortés put Alvarado {{in command}} of 30 horsemen, 18 <b>arbalesters</b> and arquebusiers, 150 Spanish foot soldiers, and 8,000 Tlaxcalan allies, and sent him, {{accompanied}} by his brother Jorge de Alvarado, Gutierrez de Badajoz, and Andrés de Monjaraz, to secure Tacuba. Cristóbal de Olid took 30 horsemen, 20 <b>arbalesters</b> and arquebusiers, 175 foot soldiers, and 8,000 Tlaxcalan allies, accompanied by Andrés de Tapia, Francisco Verdugo, and Francisco de Lugo, and secured Coyohuacan. [...] Gonzalo de Sandoval took 24 horsemen, 14 arquebusiers and <b>arbalesters,</b> 150 Spanish foot soldiers, and 8,000 warriors from Chalco and Huexotzinco, accompanied by Luis Marin and Pedro de Ircio, to secure Ixtlapalapan. [...] Cortés commanded the 13 launches. Cortés' forces took up these positions on May 22.|$|R
50|$|The battle {{began with}} a short {{skirmish}} between the French <b>arbalesters</b> and the English archers. Then the men-at-arms engaged directly without seeking to maneuver. It was a bloody combat, because all wanted this battle to be decisive {{and put an end}} to the long and cruel war. Moreover, orders were given on both sides not to give quarter to captives.|$|R
50|$|Cortés had 84 horsemen, 194 <b>arbalesters</b> and arquebusiers, plus 650 Spanish foot soldiers. He {{stationed}} 25 men {{on every}} launch, 12 oarsmen, 12 crossbowmen and musketeers, and a captain. Each launch had rigging, sails, oars, and spare oars. Additionally, Cortés had 20,000 warriors from Tlascala, Huexotzinco, and Cholula. The Tlascalans {{were led by}} Xicotencatl II and Chichimecatecle. Cortés was ready to start the blockade of Mexico after Corpus Christi (feast).|$|R

5000|$|The Master of Crossbowmen (Maître des Arbalétriers) or more precisely, Master of <b>Arbalesters</b> or Master of Archers was {{the title}} of a {{commander}} of the Infantry of the French army (the [...] "host") in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The position was an honorific title, not a military rank, created by Louis IX. The position existed until the reign of François I, when its duties were transferred to the Grand Master of Artillery.|$|R
60|$|With a shout, twenty picked men rushed {{forward with}} the pine-tree under their arms, the heavy end turned toward the gate. The <b>arbalesters</b> on the tower leaned over and shot into the midst of them, but could not stop their advance. Two dropped, but the others raising their shields ran onward still shouting, crossed the bridge of fagots, and came with a thundering crash against the door. It {{splintered}} from base to arch, but kept its place.|$|R
2500|$|Corsairs (Evil) – Another {{alternative}} to the usual Harad army is that of Umbar, which can use Harad Warriors but also involves corsairs. Until recently Corsairs were unavailable, and only existed as player-made conversions. However, {{with the release of}} the Harad sourcebook, Games Workshop released some new Corsair miniatures; including metal <b>Arbalesters</b> and a new character: Dalamyr, Fleetmaster of Umbar. Based on Legions of Middle Earth, a Corsair War Machine will be released in the future along with [...] "Corsair Reavers", most likely to be elite Warriors.|$|R
