5|$|On 11 November 1918, Germany {{entered into}} the <b>Armistice</b> with the Western Allies. According {{to the terms of}} the <b>Armistice,</b> the most modern {{components}} of Germany's surface fleet were interned in the British naval base at Scapa Flow, {{while the rest of the}} fleet was demilitarized. On the day the <b>armistice</b> took effect, Hannover was sent briefly to Swinemünde, before returning to Kiel on 14–15 November along with Schlesien. Hannover was decommissioned a month later on 17 December in accordance with the terms of the <b>Armistice.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 3 November 1918, the Austro-Hungarian {{government}} {{signed the}} <b>Armistice</b> of Villa Giusti with Italy, ending {{their participation in}} the conflict. Following the <b>armistice,</b> the entire Austro-Hungarian fleet was transferred to the newly formed Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Plymouth after the <b>Armistice</b> was signed, Parker carried mail and passengers between Plymouth and Brest. She made a cruise to German ports in early 1919 {{to implement the}} terms of the <b>armistice,</b> before steaming to the Baltic Sea to assist members and vessels of the American Relief Administration. Parker sailed for New York on 20 July 1919 and, upon arrival, was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 1, Atlantic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of the Alps, 154 French {{soldiers}} were {{captured by the}} Italians. These prisoners were forgotten during the <b>armistice</b> negotiations, and the final agreement {{makes no mention of}} them. They were held at the POW camp in Fonte d'Amore in Sulmona, along with 600 Greeks and 200 Britons, treated, by all accounts, in accordance with the laws of war. Their fate is unknown after Italy's <b>armistice</b> with the Allies, when they presumably came under German control.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{collapse}} in November 1918, {{a significant portion}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow according to the terms of the <b>Armistice.</b> Rheinland and her three sisters were not among the ships listed for internment, so they remained in German ports. However, a copy of The Times informed von Reuter that the <b>Armistice</b> was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Rear Admiral von Reuter came to the conclusion that the British intended to seize the German ships after the <b>Armistice</b> expired. To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.|$|E
5|$|News of the <b>armistice</b> on 11 November 1918 reached Southern Rhodesia {{the same}} day, and was {{announced}} {{to the town of}} Salisbury by the repeated blowing of the klaxon at the Castle Brewery. Hysterical street parties started almost immediately, and in the evening the people let off fireworks and lit a huge bonfire on Salisbury kopje. Bulawayo celebrated with a street party that continued uninterrupted for over 48 hours. Smaller towns marked the <b>armistice</b> with their own celebratory functions and events.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 2008, {{during the}} first <b>Armistice</b> Day since his death, Rue de Verdun in Le Kremlin-Bicêtre was renamed Rue de Verdun-Lazare-Ponticelli.|$|E
5|$|A copy of The Times {{informed}} von Reuter {{that the}} <b>Armistice</b> was to expire {{at noon on}} 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Von Reuter {{came to the conclusion}} that the British intended to seize the German ships after the <b>Armistice</b> expired. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Kaiser sank at 13:24; the ship was raised in 1929 and broken up for scrap in Rosyth starting in 1930.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the <b>Armistice</b> of Mudros on 30 October ended the war for the Ottoman Empire, the four {{remaining}} U-boats of the Constantinople Flotilla—UB-14, UB-42, , and —fled to Sevastopol. There they were surrendered on 26 November. UB-42 was broken up at Malta in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Again, on {{the same}} day, the Vichy French {{government}} issued orders for the naval base and city of Gibraltar to be bombarded. As a result, six bomber squadrons of the Vichy French Air Force (Armée de l'Air de Vichy) and four squadrons of the Vichy French Navy (Marine nationale de Vichy) were employed in the operation. The 64 bombers flew from bases in Oran, Tafaroui (in Algeria), Meknes, Mediouna, and Port Lyautey (in Morocco). The French action was approved by both the German <b>Armistice</b> Commission and the Italian <b>Armistice</b> Commission.|$|E
5|$|Agamemnon {{underwent}} a refit at Malta in 1918. On 30 October the Ottoman Empire signed the <b>Armistice</b> of Mudros on board Agamemnon {{while she was}} anchored at Lemnos in the northern Aegean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Agamemnon {{was part}} of the British {{squadron}} that went to Constantinople in November 1918 following the <b>armistice.</b> She returned to the United Kingdom in March 1919, where she paid off at Chatham Dockyard and went into reserve on 20 March.|$|E
5|$|At {{the discussions}} of the Israeli-Jordano <b>Armistice</b> at Rhodes, the Israelis {{requested}} unsuccessfully {{the removal of the}} legion from Latrun. It subsequently remained under Jordanian control until the Six-Day War.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Old City {{together}} with the Wall was controlled by Jordan. Article VIII of the 1949 <b>Armistice</b> Agreement provided for Israeli Jewish access to the Western Wall. However, for the following nineteen years, despite numerous requests by Israeli officials and Jewish groups to the United Nations and other international bodies to attempt to enforce the <b>armistice</b> agreement, Jordan refused to abide by this clause. Neither Israeli Arabs nor Israeli Jews could visit their holy places in the Jordanian territories.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{collapse}} in November 1918, {{a significant portion}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow under the terms of the <b>Armistice.</b> Westfalen and her three sisters—the oldest dreadnoughts in the German navy-were not among the ships listed for internment, so they remained in German ports. During the internment, a copy of The Times informed the German commander, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, that the <b>Armistice</b> was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships after the <b>Armistice</b> expired. To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.|$|E
5|$|Following the November 1918 <b>Armistice,</b> the U.S. Navy {{converted}} fifteen older battleships, eight armoured cruisers and two larger protected cruisers {{for temporary}} service as transports. These ships made one to six trans-Atlantic round-trips each, bringing home {{a total of}} more than 145,000 passengers.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the signing}} of the <b>Armistice</b> on 11 November, which ended all fighting, Nicholson {{remained}} in French waters. After arriving at New York on 10 January 1919, Nicholson resumed operations along the east coast until placed in reserve at Philadelphia on 27 November.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} country, {{however, the}} {{occupation}} was only brought {{to an end in}} the aftermath of the <b>armistice</b> of November 1918 as the Belgian Army advanced into the country to replace evacuating German troops in maintaining law and order.|$|E
5|$|In October 1918, Superb and {{her sister}} ship, , were {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet and Superb became the flagship of its commander, Vice-Admiral Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe, upon her arrival at Mudros on 31 October. The ship led an Allied squadron that entered the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, on 13 November, following the <b>Armistice</b> of Mudros. A month later, Gough-Calthorpe tasked Superb to provide a crew for the , which had been {{turned over to the}} Allies by the Germans after the <b>Armistice</b> of 11 November. On 4 December, the ship conveyed Gough-Calthorpe to Odessa, Russia, to inspect the situation there; he made another such visit to Port Said, Egypt, in late March 1919.|$|E
5|$|In Saxony, a joint {{force of}} Austrians and Brunswickers {{under the command}} of General Kienmayer was far more successful, {{defeating}} a corps {{under the command of}} General Junot at the Battle of Gefrees. After taking the capital, Dresden, and pushing back an army under the command of Napoleon's brother, Jérôme Bonaparte, the Austrians were effectively in control of all of Saxony. But by this time, the main Austrian force had already been defeated at Wagram and the <b>armistice</b> of Znaim had been agreed. The Duke of Brunswick however, refused to be bound by the <b>armistice</b> and led his corps on a fighting march right across Germany to the mouth of the River Weser, from where they sailed to England and entered British service.|$|E
5|$|In total U-70 sank 54 {{ships with}} a {{combined}} tonnage of 139,065 and damaged four with a tonnage of 20,369 in her twelve war patrols. She was surrendered to the British on 20 November 1918, nine days after the <b>Armistice,</b> and broken up at Bo'ness in 1919–20.|$|E
5|$|On <b>Armistice</b> Day 1922, a {{memorial}} to the employees of the GWR who died during the war was unveiled by Viscount Churchill. The bronze memorial, depicting a soldier reading a letter, was sculpted by Charles Sargeant Jagger and stands on platform 1.|$|E
5|$|Sir: Yours of {{this date}} proposing <b>Armistice,</b> and {{appointment}} of Commissioners, to settle terms of Capitulation is just received. No terms except unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted.|$|E
5|$|Suenson {{waited outside}} the British zone of , but the Austrian-Prussian {{squadron}} {{was able to}} escape during the night to Cuxhaven, arriving at about 04:00 on 10 May. On reaching the port, the Austrian ships began {{to repair the damage}} sustained in the battle. Suenson sent his casualties ashore and resumed patrolling in the southern North Sea, between Heligoland and the Elbe. The day of the battle, the two sides had signed an <b>armistice</b> in London that took effect on 12 May, temporarily ending the fighting. The <b>armistice</b> lasted until 26 June, when fighting broke out again on land. The following day, a second Austrian squadron, which included the ship of the line Kaiser, the armored frigate Don Juan d'Austria, and two smaller vessels under Vice Admiral Bernhard von Wüllerstorf-Urbair arrived to reinforce Tegetthoff's ships. The now outnumbered Danish fleet remained in port {{for the rest of the}} war and did not seek battle with the Austro-Prussian squadron. Instead, the Austrian and Prussian naval forces supported operations to capture the islands off the western Danish coast. These advances, coupled with the capture of the island of Als in the Baltic Sea, forced the Danes to seek a second <b>armistice</b> on 29 June.|$|E
5|$|The {{final month}} of the war offered little respite to the battalion. In {{the days leading up}} to the <b>Armistice</b> of 11 November 1918, the Liverpool Scottish helped to secure {{numerous}} villages without opposition and crossed the River Scheldt on 9 November. On the day of the <b>Armistice,</b> the Liverpool Scottish was situated at Villers-Notre-Dame. With the 165th and 166th brigades, the battalion had been readied to assault German positions obstructing passage into the town of Ath. Such a prospect was averted, however, when the 2/5th Lancashire Fusiliers attacked and seized one of the bridges before it could be demolished.|$|E
5|$|Throughout World War I (1914–1918) Lasker {{played in}} only two serious chess events. He convincingly won (5½−½) a non-title match against Tarrasch in 1916. In September–October 1918, shortly before the <b>armistice,</b> he won a quadrangular (four-player) tournament, half a point ahead of Rubinstein.|$|E
5|$|Under those chaotic {{circumstances}} a Bulgarian delegation {{arrived in}} Thessaloniki {{to ask for}} an <b>armistice.</b> On 29 September, the Bulgarians were granted the <b>Armistice</b> of Salonica by General d'Esperey. The Bulgarian downfall turned the strategic and operational balance of {{the war against the}} Central Powers. The Macedonian Front was brought to an end at noon on 30 September, when the ceasefire came into effect, and the Radomir Rebellion was put down, by Bulgarian forces, as of the 2 October. Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria abdicated and went into exile the following day.|$|E

The treaty included the full capitulation of the 11th German Army, bringing the final tally of German and Bulgarian prisoners to 77,000 and granting the Allies 500 artillery pieces. The Radomir Rebellion was put down, by Bulgarian forces, as of the 2 October, while Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria abdicated and went into exile the following day.|$|E
5|$|After the {{hostilities}} {{had ended}} on 11 November 1918 with Germany signing the <b>Armistice,</b> Conyngham sailed from Queenstown on 14 December 1918 for Boston {{to have an}} overhaul. From February to April 1919, the destroyer participated in fleet exercises and division maneuvers in the Caribbean. Returning to Boston, she was placed in reduced commission until 1921.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the <b>Armistice</b> on 11 November, which ended all fighting, O'Brien transported mail and {{passengers}} between Brest, France, and Plymouth, England. She returned to New York on 8 January 1919, but returned to European waters in May when she served as one of the rescue pickets stationed along the route across the Atlantic flown by three Navy NC-type seaplanes in the first aerial crossing of the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|After the {{southern}} campaign, the Commonwealth {{had to deal}} with a threat from the north, as the <b>armistice,</b> ending the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1629) was expiring. The majority of Polish nobles preferred to solve the problem through negotiations, unwilling to pay taxes for a new war, provided that Sweden was open to negotiations and concessions (in particular, to retreat from the occupied Polish coastal territories). Władysław himself was hoping for a war, which could yield some more significant territorial gains, and even managed to gather a sizeable army, with navy elements, near the disputed territories. Sweden, weakened by involvement in the Thirty Years' War, was however open to a peaceful solution. Władysław could not go against the decision of the Sejm and Senate, and agreed to support the treaty. Thus both sides agreed to sign the <b>Armistice</b> of Stuhmsdorf (Sztumska Wieś) on 12 September 1635, favourable to the Commonwealth, which regained the Prussian territories, and called for a reduction of the Swedish tolls on the maritime trade.|$|E
5|$|Amid decolonisation and the Wind of Change, the Federation {{failed to}} become a Commonwealth realm and {{collapsed}} in 1963. Two years later, following prolonged dispute with Britain over the terms for full sovereignty, the mostly white government in Southern Rhodesia (or Rhodesia, following Northern Rhodesia's independence as Zambia) issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI). The Rhodesian government, counting several World War II veterans including the Prime Minister Ian Smith, attempted to emphasise Rhodesians' prior war record on Britain's behalf by declaring independence on <b>Armistice</b> Day, 11 November, at 11:00 local time. As part of its subsequent isolation of Rhodesia, the UK government banned the post-UDI authorities from {{taking part in the}} annual <b>Armistice</b> Day service at the Cenotaph in London. Smith's government organised its own Rhodesian wreath-laying ceremony there. Veterans of World War II and Malaya held many key positions in the Rhodesian Security Forces during the Bush War of the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{captured}} when the Germans took {{the city in}} May 1918 and {{was turned over to}} the Allies after the <b>Armistice</b> in November 1918. Their engines were destroyed in 1919 by the British when they withdrew from Sevastopol to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using them against the White Russians. They were abandoned when the Whites evacuated the Crimea in 1920 and were scrapped in 1922–23.|$|E
5|$|By October 1918, Austria {{prepared}} to transfer her entire fleet {{to the newly}} created State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (later to become the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) {{in order to keep}} it out of Italian hands. On 10 November 1918, one day before the Allied <b>Armistice</b> with Germany, and six days after the Austrians and Italians agreed to the <b>Armistice</b> of Villa Giusti, Yugoslav officers with scratch crews sailed Radetzky and Zrínyi out of Pola. Once outside Pola, the ships spotted heavy units of the Italian fleet; the two battleships hoisted American flags and sailed south to escape. A squadron of US Navy submarine chasers operating off the city of Spalato accepted the surrender of Radetzky and Zrínyi. However, under the subsequent peace treaty, the Allied powers ignored the transfer of the Austro-Hungarian ships to the Yugoslav navy which had already taken place; instead, the ships were ceded to Italy. Radetzky was broken up in Italy between 1920 and 1921.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the <b>armistice</b> on 22 June, {{approximately}} 1.8million French soldiers were in captivity; a figure representing roughly 10 percent of the total adult male population of France at the time. One of the terms of the Compiègne <b>Armistice</b> was that French prisoners would remain in German custody {{until the end of the}} war which was thought to be imminent. French prisoners came from all backgrounds, regions and civilian occupations within France and also included a substantial number of soldiers from the French colonial empire. Nevertheless, approximately a third of all French prisoners of war were French farmers or peasants and, in some regions, the total proportion of agricultural workers captured was much higher. This created labour shortages in many civilian occupations, particularly agriculture which was largely unmechanised.|$|E
5|$|Closer to home, Southern Rhodesian {{military}} surveyors {{contributed to}} the preliminary planning work for the Allied invasion of Madagascar in May 1942, and landed at Diego Suarez with the invading forces. They remained there long after the Vichy French garrison agreed to an <b>armistice</b> at Ambalavao on 6 November 1942—the last Rhodesian left the island in October 1943.|$|E
