5000|$|Around 1980, Nakamichi {{introduced}} {{the third generation}} of 1000 and 700 three-head decks. The 1000ZXL and 700ZXL had full metal capability as well as normal and high bias abilities and had built-in computers for calibrating the decks to a specific tape.

5000|$|With a {{removable}} viewfinder, the F-1's flash coupler originally attached atop the rewind crank. Initially, {{there were two}} flash couplers, D and L. The D model was a simple x-synch coupler that allowed any non-dedicated manual or auto flash to be used. The Flash Coupler L contained two batteries (now hard to find, one being originally a 1.35v mercuric oxide and the other being the uncommon PX-1 size), one which powered a light to light up the metering window visible in the viewfinder, {{and the other to}} work with the original Canon <b>Auto</b> <b>tuning</b> system (CATS). The CATS used a special auto flash, the SpeedLite 133D and Flash auto Rings A, B, A2 and B2 and Canon 50 mm and 35 mm Lenses which signalled through the cords the distance of the subject and the charge level of the flash to allow match needle flash photography.|$|E
50|$|Another {{significant}} change {{that aims to}} improve network throughput is the automatic resizing of TCP Receive window. The receive window (RWIN) specifies how much data a host is prepared to receive, and is limited by, among other things, the available buffer space. In other words, it {{is a measure of}} how much data the remote transmitter can send before requiring an acknowledgement for the outstanding data. When the receive window is too small, the remote transmitter will frequently find that it has hit the limit of how much outstanding data it can transmit, even though there is enough bandwidth available to transmit more data. This leads to incomplete link utilization. So using a larger RWIN size boosts throughput in such situations; an auto-adjusting RWIN tries to keep the throughput rate as high as is permissible by the bandwidth of the link. Receive window <b>auto</b> <b>tuning</b> functionality continually monitors the bandwidth and the latency of TCP connections individually and optimize the receive window for each connection. The window size is increased in high-bandwidth (~5 Mbit/s+) or high-latency (>10ms) situations.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the first}} OSD-equipped {{televisions}} were introduced by RCA in the late 1970s, simply displaying the channel number {{and the time of}} day {{at the bottom of the}} screen. An OSD chip was added to the General instruments (GI) varactor tuning chip set designed in conjunction with RCA and Telefunken. The original OSD was merely to placate users who were faced with a snowy screen during <b>auto</b> <b>tuning.</b> Something the original architecture had not seen as an issue until it was first demonstrated. Once a display had been injected it was simple, in the next iteration, to add a real time clock (RTC) to display time and date. [...] In the 1980s, OSD-capable TVs started to be more common, such as Zenith's [...] "System 3" [...] series. Akai have been credited with the introduction of OSD in VCRs in the 1980s, including the introduction of on screen programming. By the mid-1990s, VCRs with these displays became widely available. This made it possible to reduce the size (and cost) of the VFD or LCD in the VCR. Eventually, as VCRs declined in popularity and prices fell, many manufacturers dropped the internal display completely, relying completely on the on-screen display. All DVD players also use on-screen displays. Many PAL television sets use the internal Teletext decoder's graphics rendering system to further reduce costs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. High-performance {{routines}} of BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) {{are constantly}} {{required in the}} field of numerical calculations. We have implemented DL-BLAS (Dynamically Load-balanced BLAS) to enhance the performance of BLAS when other tasks use CPU resources of multi-core CPU architectures. DL-BLAS tiles matrices into submatrices to make subtasks and dynamically assigns tasks to CPU cores. We found that the dimensions of submatrices used in DL-BLAS affect the performance. To attain high-performance we have to solve an optimization problem where variables are the dimensions of the submatrices. The search space of the optimization problem is so vast that exhaustive search is unrealistic. We propose an <b>auto</b> <b>tuning</b> search algorithm which consists of Diagonal Search and Reductive Search. Our <b>auto</b> <b>tuning</b> algorithm provides semi-optimal parameters in realistic computing time. Using our algorithm, we got parameters which gave us the best performance in most of cases. As a result, DL-BLAS reached higher performance than ATLAS and GotoBLAS in many performance evaluation tests...|$|E
