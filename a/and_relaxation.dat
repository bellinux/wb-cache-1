5|$|The {{function}} of TnI is to control striated muscle contraction <b>and</b> <b>relaxation.</b> Troponin I interacts with all major regulatory proteins in the sarcomeric thin filaments of cardiac and skeletal muscles: troponin C, troponin T, tropomyosin and actin. When cytosolic Ca2+ is low, TnI binds the thin filament {{to block the}} myosin binding sites on actin. The rise of cytosolic Ca2+ results in binding to the N-terminal domain of troponin C and induces conformational changes in troponin C and the troponin complex, which releases the inhibition of myosin-actin interaction and activates myosin ATPase and cross bridge cycling to generate myosin power strokes and muscle contraction.|$|E

5|$|C-terminal truncation: The C-terminal end {{segment is}} the most conserved region of TnI. As an {{allosteric}} structure regulated by Ca2+ in the troponin complex, it binds and stabilizes the position of tropomyosin in low Ca2+ state implicating {{a role in the}} inhibition of actomyosin ATPase. A deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids was found during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in Langendorff perfused rat hearts. It was also seen in myocardial stunning in coronary bypass patients. Over-expression of the C-terminal truncated cardiac TnI (cTnI1-192) in transgenic mouse heart resulted in a phenotype of myocardial stunning with systolic and diastolic dysfunctions. Replacement of intact cTnI with cTnT1-192 in myofibrils and cardiomyocytes did not affect maximal tension development but decreased the rates of force redevelopment <b>and</b> <b>relaxation.</b>|$|E

A user of an interactive application, however, desires explanations <b>and</b> <b>relaxations</b> containing the most important constraints. To address this need, we define preferred explanations <b>and</b> <b>relaxations</b> based on user preferences between constraints and we compute them by a generic method which works for arbitrary CP, SAT, or DL solvers. We significantly accelerate the basic method by a divide-and-conquer strategy and thus provide the technological basis for the explanation facility of a principal industrial constraint programming tool, which is, for example, used in numerous configuration applications...|$|R

Elders are not expected to hunt or fight for their Clan, but are able to do so if the mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for a Clan to have more than three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E

40|$|International audienceRecruitment and de-recruitment {{thresholds}} {{of motor}} {{units in the}} wrist extensor muscles can undergo important random fluctuations, {{even when they are}} measured during stereotyped contractions <b>and</b> <b>relaxations.</b> These fluctuations were statistically quantified and compared. The statistical analysis indicated that recruitment and de-recruitment thresholds display the same kind of fluctuations, and that the successive measurements are randomly distributed following a quasi-normal law. We suggest that the notion of force threshold for motor unit recruitment and de-recruitment might be oversimplified and that a motor unit seems to have a range of force in which it can be recruited or de-recruited. Comparison of the mean values of recruitment and de-recruitment thresholds of the motor units in the extensor carpi radialis muscles showed that de-recruitment thresholds were significantly lower than recruitment thresholds. This difference in the thresholds, together with the difference in the motor unit discharge frequency during a contraction <b>and</b> a <b>relaxation,</b> suggests a differential control of the motoneurone activity during contractions <b>and</b> <b>relaxations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{similarities}} and dissimilarities between creep <b>and</b> stress <b>relaxation</b> behavior of age formed aluminum alloys, both creep ageing <b>and</b> stress <b>relaxation</b> ageing experiments have been conducted with plate shaped 7055 aluminum alloy specimens on the 100 KN tensile testing machine performed at 120 ˚C for 20 h, under different stress levels from 190. 0 to 357. 8 MPa. The experimental results show that similar variation trends for creep <b>and</b> stress <b>relaxation</b> behavior were observed. Both creep <b>and</b> stress <b>relaxation</b> curves {{can be divided into}} two stages. During the first stage, higher creep rate <b>and</b> stress <b>relaxation</b> rate occur, which increase with stress levels but decrease with ageing time. While during the second stage, both the creep rate <b>and</b> the stress <b>relaxation</b> rate reach its lowest value and keep constant. A set of unified creep ageing constitutive equations has been developed and calibrated from creep experimental data, which can be used to predict the creep strain under age forming conditions perfectly. But the experimental results from stress relaxation ageing tests cannot be predicted with the established creep ageing constitutive equations, which shows {{that there is not a}} one-to-one correspondence between creep <b>and</b> stress <b>relaxation,</b> creep deformation is the most important but not the only reason for stress relaxation under age forming condition...|$|R
