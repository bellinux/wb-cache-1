At Clark Road in Cornwall, VT74 turns to the northeast once again, passing through more forests before terminating at VT30 in Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|Brueys then {{anchored}} his fleet in Aboukir Bay, {{ready to}} support Napoleon if required. Nelson meanwhile {{had crossed the}} Mediterranean again in a fruitless attempt to locate the French and had returned to Naples to re-provision. He sailed again, intending to search the seas off Cyprus, but decided to pass Alexandria <b>again</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> final check. In doing so his force captured a French merchant ship, which provided the first news of the French fleet: they had passed south-east of Crete a month before, heading to Alexandria.

5|$|Expectations for Schenn {{were high}} {{heading into the}} 2009â€“10 season. During {{training}} camp, Toronto Head Coach Ron Wilson named {{him as one of}} the team's top four defencemen. As the season progressed, however, Schenn's play was disappointing, and Wilson kept him out of the line-up for a game in October and <b>again</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> three-game stretch in December.

DiCaprio received rave reviews for his performance and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, also receiving another Academy Award nomination.|$|E

Pflueger worked with muralist Arthur Frank Mathews to achieve a rich palette of color most prominently displayed in a geometric floral pattern on the main ceiling. The Alhambra was named San Francisco Landmark No. 217 in 1996.|$|E
