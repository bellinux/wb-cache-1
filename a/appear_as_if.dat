5|$|Visual {{differentiation}} {{from the}} fish crow (C. ossifragus) {{is extremely difficult}} and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish crows {{tend to have more}} slender bills and feet. There may also be a small sharp hook {{at the end of the}} upper bill. Fish crows also <b>appear</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.|$|E

5|$|Deborah Jean Lodge and colleagues, in a {{reorganization}} of the family Hygrophoraceae based on molecular phylogenetics, proposed that H.appalachianensis should be the type species of the new section Pseudofirmae in genus Hygrocybe. Species in this section, which include Hygrocybe chloochlora, H.rosea, and H.trinitensis, have sticky or glutinous caps that often have perforations in the center. Their spores and basidia are dimorphic (of two sizes), {{and the development of}} the microbasidia and macrobasidia is often staggered. The macrobasidia are club shaped and <b>appear</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they have a stalk.|$|E
5|$|In the Age of Sail, {{deception}} {{was often}} used by ships, and paint was applied ad hoc by ships' captains for temporary tactical advantage. A ship might be painted {{to look like}} another, it might have its cannon ports hidden by painted canvas to look harmless, or it might have additional cannon ports painted on to appear more powerful. For example, {{in one of his}} battles during 1778–1782, American privateer Jonathan Haraden hid the guns of his ship the General Pickering, to <b>appear</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were a slow merchant ship. Haraden allowed his ship to be approached at close range by a much faster British privateer, then he quickly pulled the painted canvas away and delivered a full broadside, capturing the enemy.|$|E
5|$|The {{general idea}} for the {{restoration}} {{was to make the}} locomotives <b>appear</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were built in the 1880s. The original, dilapidated boilers of the four locomotives built by Baldwin Locomotive Works were replaced with new, smaller boilers built by Dixon Boiler Works. Their worn-out wood and steel cabs were replaced with new ones made of fiberglass, and they were given new tenders, which used the trucks from the originals. Many of the smaller original parts on the locomotives such as the domes and brass bells on top of the boilers, the wheels, and the side rods were successfully refurbished and retained. The locomotives' fireboxes were also reconfigured to burn diesel oil. Replicas of their builder plates were also made to replace the originals.|$|E

With Kevin still away, Noah calls Claire over to help him cook. She ends up having dinner with him, during which he unashamedly flirts with her. Despite Claire's hesitation, she lets Noah seduce her and they have sex. Claire tells Noah that she regrets their night together, causing him to punch a wall in rage. The school year begins, with Noah joining an uncomfortable Claire's class after hacking into her computer, making it <b>appear</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she had {{requested}} this. Noah manipulates Kevin into hating his father, causing him to lash out at Garrett. Later, Kevin overexerts himself at the gymnasium and goes into shock; Noah saves his life by injecting him with Kevin's EpiPen. Claire receives flowers from Noah, and she confronts him about this. Noah witnesses Claire and Garrett on a date together, which escalates his obsession with her.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris sneaks into Meg's {{bedroom and}} reads her diary. Discovering him, Meg chases after Chris while Stewie walks by the staircase. Accidentally bumped by them, Stewie tumbles {{down the stairs}} and becomes unconscious, {{suffering}} a severe head wound. Chris and Meg hide the wound with a hat. Continuing the charade, they are approached by Peter, who asks how long Stewie has been unconscious. Peter reveals that he has knocked both of them out plenty of times, and wants to continue hiding Stewie's injury from Lois until he can frame her for it. The next day, noticing Lois pulling out of the driveway, Peter throws Stewie behind her car, making it <b>appear</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Lois has run him over. Lois suggests they frame someone else, but Peter professes his love for her and suggests they take Stewie to the hospital. At the end of the show, Stewie walks in on the family with his head wrapped in bandages, revealing that many months have passed since his accident, he asks what happened to him.|$|E
5|$|The {{first five}} seasons {{of the series}} were mainly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia; {{production}} of the show's sixth season, however, was based in Los Angeles, California. Several of the scenes were filmed on the sets from NYPD Blue, whose sets were located just across from The X-Files studios. All of Fellig's cameras were borrowed from the University of California's Museum of Photography. Many of the photographs were used courtesy of Corbis. The production staff of The X-Files were tasked with not only creating the photographs that Fellig {{was supposed to have}} taken, but also with crafting each so that they would <b>appear</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they had been taken from different times. Tom Day, the episodes property master, had to research popular government typefaces and printing technologies to make the pictures appear as historically accurate as possible. Geoffrey Lewis, who portrayed Fellig, was photographed several times and each photo was edited to give the photographs the appearance of coming from different eras.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dave starts listing to Hurley why the island events are {{occurring}} in his mind suffered from continuous interruption, as military exercises on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam led to many takes being ruined by plane noises. Weather problems also plagued production, with loud waves causing Hurley's and Libby's beach scene to be redubbed in post-production, and rain on one day changing {{the location of the}} basketball game scene to an indoor court, and also leading to a second day of filming on the cliff. The cliff was digitally redesigned in post-production to <b>appear</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the actors were standing on the edge. Dave's jump was done by making a stunt double jump in front of a bluescreen, with the body hitting the water and resulting splash being rendered through computer graphics. The mental hospital was shot at the Laniakea YWCA in Honolulu, except for Dr. Brooks's office, which was done inside a studio.|$|E
5|$|Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) {{built an}} eight-foot foam {{model of the}} Zeppelin to {{complement}} shots of Ford and Connery climbing into the biplane. A biplane model with a two-foot wingspan {{was used for the}} shot of the biplane detaching. Stop motion animation was used for the shot of the German fighter's wings breaking off as it crashes through the tunnel. The tunnel was a 210 feet model that occupied 14 of ILM's parking spaces for two months. It was built in eight-foot sections, with hinges allowing each section to be opened to film through. Ford and Connery were filmed against bluescreen; the sequence required their car to have a dirty windscreen, but to make the integration easier this was removed and later composited into the shot. Dust and shadows were animated onto shots of the plane miniature to make it <b>appear</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it disturbed rocks and dirt before it exploded. Several hundred tim-birds were used in the background shots of the seagulls striking the other plane; for the closer shots, ILM dropped feather-coated crosses onto the camera. These only looked convincing because the scene's quick cuts merely required shapes that suggested gulls. ILM's Wes Takahashi supervised the film's effects sequences.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in a Last Man Standing match next. In a Last Man Standing match, {{there are}} no {{disqualifications}} or count outs, instead to win the match the competitor has to force their opponent to {{not be able to}} reach a standing position by the count of 10. However, this match was only promoted as a Last Man Standing match, instead it was held under Texas Death match rules where a wrestler must pin or submit their opponent and then have them fail to respond to a count of 10. Styles got the first fall of the night, when he forced Angle to tap out to Angle's own signature submission maneuver the Ankle lock. Angle made it to his feet before the count concluded. Angle gained a pinfall later on in the match after slamming Styles off the top of a padded turnbuckle with a suplex. Before Styles could reach his feet to beat the count, Angle slammed Styles onto the mat back-first with his signature Olympic slam maneuver and gained another pinfall to start the count over. Styles beat that count as well, with Angle trying for the Olympic Slam again before Styles' countered it into his signature Styles' Clash maneuver and pinned Angle. After Angle reached his feet, Styles and Angle fought up a padded turnbuckle with Styles gaining the advantage. At this time, Styles grabbed Angle by the neck and fell backwards from the turnbuckle and drove Angle head-first into the mat. Angle failed to reach the 10 count afterwards, with Styles being declared the winner of the contest at 24 minutes and 50 seconds. Following the encounter, the referee called for medical attention for Angle who was scripted to <b>appear</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had suffered a neck injury. Styles then entered the ring once Angle reached his feet and lifted Angle up and dropped him on his head. As Styles walked up the ramp, he was attacked by Sting, who drove Styles' head into the ramp with his signature Scorpion Death Drop maneuver, as Kevin Nash looked on.|$|E
