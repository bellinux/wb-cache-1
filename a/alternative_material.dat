25|$|Among major operas, Boris Godunov {{shares with}} Giuseppe Verdi's Don Carlos (1867) the {{distinction}} of having an extremely complex creative history, {{as well as a}} great wealth of <b>alternative</b> <b>material.</b> The composer created two versions—the Original Version of 1869, which was rejected for production by the Imperial Theatres, and the Revised Version of 1872, which received its first performance in 1874 in Saint Petersburg.|$|E
25|$|Lead crystal {{glassware}} {{was formerly}} used to store and serve drinks, {{but due to}} the potential health risks of lead, this has become rare. One <b>alternative</b> <b>material</b> is crystal glass, in which barium oxide, zinc oxide, or potassium oxide are employed instead of lead oxide. Lead-free crystal has a similar refractive index to lead crystal, but it is lighter and it has less dispersive power.|$|E

50|$|<b>Alternative</b> <b>materials</b> {{can also}} be used. Doped binary {{compounds}} such as aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) and indium-doped cadmium oxide have been proposed as <b>alternative</b> <b>materials.</b> Other, inorganic <b>alternatives</b> include aluminum, gallium or indium—doped zinc oxide (AZO, GZO or IZO).|$|R
40|$|Currently, a {{beryllium}} {{brazing alloy}} {{is used to}} connect appendages to CANDU ® fuel bundle elements. However, because of a possible reduction of the occupational limit on airborne beryllium particulates, several <b>alternative</b> <b>materials</b> have been proposed. Appendages brazed using <b>alternative</b> <b>materials</b> must be tested thoroughly to ensure stability under the forces typically encountered during a refuelling operation. Consequently, an impact testing method was developed at the Royal Military College of Canada to compare the impact strengths of bearing pad joints brazed with beryllium and <b>alternative</b> <b>materials.</b> 1...|$|R
