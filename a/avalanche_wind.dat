50|$|When extratropical {{cyclones}} deposit heavy, {{wet snow}} with a snow-water equivalent (SWE) ratio of between 6:1 and 12:1 and a weight {{in excess of}} 10 pounds per square foot (~50 kg/m2) piles onto trees or electricity lines, significant damage may occur on a scale usually associated with strong tropical cyclones. An avalanche can occur with a sudden thermal or mechanical impact on snow that has accumulated on a mountain, which causes the snow to rush downhill suddenly. Preceding an avalanche is a phenomenon known as an <b>avalanche</b> <b>wind</b> caused by the approaching avalanche itself, which adds to its destructive potential. Large amounts of snow which accumulate on top of man-made structures can lead to structural failure. During snowmelt, acidic precipitation which previously fell in the snow pack is released and harms marine life.|$|E

50|$|The {{lift system}} has a {{combined}} up hill capacity of 66,000 people per hour. In total there are 51 lifts serving the resort. At peak times lift queues {{can be very}} long, and it can take over an hour to travel from the village {{to the top of}} the glacier, which is sometimes closed due to blizzards, high <b>winds,</b> <b>avalanche</b> risks, or a combination of both.|$|R
2500|$|The season premiered on May 31, 2009. The Dalton Highway (Alaska Route 11) {{serves as}} only road link between Alaska's {{populated}} areas down {{south and the}} oil rigs of the arctic north, to bring supplies nearly [...] from Fairbanks to the Prudhoe Bay Oil Fields and offshore rigs. However, the combination of <b>avalanches,</b> strong Arctic <b>winds</b> leading to whiteouts, and unforgiving terrain has led to hundreds of accidents in past years. Two thousand loads must be moved up the road within 12 weeks, before the ice melts on the Arctic Ocean.|$|R
30|$|To {{investigate}} {{these dimensions}} of resilience, expert interviews with various stakeholders {{from the field}} of natural hazard prevention, disaster response, and information platforms were conducted in the canton of Grisons, Switzerland. For this, a matrix was developed that shows on one axis all the natural harzard-induced disasters that can occur in the study region (intense rainfall and snowfall, snow <b>avalanches,</b> storms, <b>wind,</b> hail, floods, debris flows, rockslides, rockfalls, landslides, earthquakes, droughts), and shows on the other axis the following guiding questions: Who in particular was affected during past disasters and who was not affected? What measures helped against the disaster? Who is very well informed, aware, and prepared for the disaster and who is not? Who would recover best from a disaster and who would severely struggle to recover? Who would even have positive externalities from a disaster? Who has more human, social, or financial capital than others? Who is resilient and who is not? The aim of these guiding questions was to identify measurable characteristics that can be employed as a measure for disaster resilience differences.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Blowing snow {{events are}} often {{associated}} {{with an increase in}} <b>avalanche</b> hazard. Strong <b>wind</b> activity at the mountain environment results indeed in uneven distribution of snow with erosion on windward side and deposition on leeward areas. Blowing snow events are responsible for the formation of cornices, increase the loading of avalanche triggering zones and can create slab structures. Nevertheless the link between blowing snow events and avalanche hazard is rarely formulated in quantitative terms mainly {{due to the lack of}} blowing snow data. In this study, we use the blowing snow data collected at the experimental site of Col du Lac Blanc located in the French Alps near the Alpe d’Huez ski resort. This experimental site is dedicated to the studies of the effects of wind on the snowpack and its stability. We made out for about 13 years an exhaustive list of blowing snow events by using different means: records of Snow Particle Counter profiles, weather sensors at different locations and reconstitution of blowing snow periods using an “expert ” method. To study the link between blowing snow events and natural or artificial avalanche activity we chose to cross-analyze our blowing snow database with several avalanche activity databases available on this mountain massif: • The permanent avalanche survey (EPA), operated by the French forestry national office and Irstea, provides information about avalanches chronicles (occurrences, run out altitudes, flow regime data), • The snow and weather network of Météo-France, • The reports of avalanche triggering of the snow patrollers of L’Alpe d’Huez ski resort...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{helicopter}} ski guide died in {{an avalanche}} at 3 : 00 pm on February 10, 1996 while guiding clients on a large west-facing slope in the Smoky Mountains of Central Idaho. The ski guide, his clients, and several other guides and their clients had skied over one hundred runs in the vicinity and on the same slope prior to the accident. The avalanche measured nearly one half-mile wide and involved three chutes that are separated by counter ridges. Three other guides and sixteen clients were on an unaffected counter ridge when the avalanche occurred. The avalanche fractured on buried surface hoar and near surface facets. The avalanche varied {{from one foot to}} an estimated five feet deep and ran on 28 to 38 degrees slopes. Forty-eight hours of extreme avalanche hazard including many natural and human triggered avalanches followed the fatal accident. Prior to the February 10 <b>avalanche,</b> significant WNW <b>winds</b> on January 27 rapidly loaded slopes throughout the area and numerous large natural and artificially triggered new snow avalanches occurred. No avalanches were reported from February 4 through February 9. An “inverted ” storm dropped several centimeters of snow and three centimeters (1. 2 inches) of water equivalent from February 4 - 8. Temperatures rose from – 16 degrees C (2 F) February 2 to – 1 degree C (30 F) February 9 and then spiked to 5 degrees C (41 F) at 2 : 00 pm February 10. Our paper will examine possible reasons why the deadly cycle occurred despite no overly dramatic weather event immediately preceding it, how the accident affected the local community including avalanche education, and possible ways to deal with similar events in the future...|$|R
