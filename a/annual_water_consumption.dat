This thesis performs an economic analysis to determine whether it is economically feasible to privatize the Jacksonville Military Complex's potable water distribution systems. To address this issue, current legislation affecting utilities privatization was studied. Interviews were conducted with representatives of the Army, Navy, and Air Force regarding their current utilities privatization efforts. A case study of NAVWEPSTA Earle was used to provide the framework in which the Jacksonville decision should be made. Data was gathered from NAS jacksonville, NAS Cecil Field, and NAVSTA Mayport to calculate their <b>annual</b> <b>water</b> <b>consumptions</b> and the current plant value of their water systems. The systems' current plant value was obtained from NAVFAC's P- 164 and adjusted for accumulated depreciation to provide the net current cost of the systems.

Methods Based on datasets of weather, soil and crop parameters and simulation precision verification, we researched biomass and deep soil desiccation in the 1 - to 45 -year-old block of black locust forestlands of Luochuan and Changwu in the semi-humid region and Yan’an and Guyuan in the semi-arid region of the Loess Plateau from 1957 to 2001 using the WinEPIC model. Important findings In Luochuan, Changwu, Yan’an and Guyuan, simulated annual net productivities of the 1 - to 45 -year-old black locust forestlands averaged 5. 33 × 103, 4. 56 × 103, 4. 03 × 103 and 3. 35 × 103 kg·hm– 2 ·a– 1, respectively. Productivity peaked when forestlands were 5 - to 8 -year-old and then tended to decrease in a pattern that followed the fluctuation of annual rainfall. In 1 - to 7 -year-old forestlands, <b>annual</b> <b>water</b> <b>consumptions</b> were higher than annual rainfalls, which resulted in soil drying at 0 – 10 m depth; soil desiccation rates in Luochuan, Changwu, Yan’an and Guyuan were 164. 3, 165. 7, 187. 1 and 190. 0 mm per year, respectively. In 8 - to 45 -year-old forestlands, the available water fluctuated at a low level within 0 – 250 mm as annual rainfalls varied.

40|$|Water for {{irrigation}} in the Canterbury region of New Zealand {{is becoming an}} increasingly precious commodity {{as it is in}} many other areas of the world. Adequate use of this resource will define the economical and environmental future of the region. Current irrigation systems, even under best management practices, over-apply water, as they do not account for spatial variability of crop water needs in fields. Over-application of water is wasteful and has environmental and economical repercussions. Water requirements are determined by crop evapotranspiration (ET). Key factors affecting ET in Canterbury are wind and solar radiation. Both of these are significantly affected by windbreaks, resulting in variability in ET and water requirements across a field. Understanding the variability in ET caused by windbreaks will enable for the correct application of water through precision irrigation systems. A theoretical model was developed to estimate savings in irrigation by accounting for windbreaks in the Canterbury region. Windbreaks reduce evapotranspiration and therefore crops/pasture behind windbreaks needs less water than those {{in other parts of the}} field. Results for a case study in Canterbury show that windbreaks can potentially reduce the <b>annual</b> on-farm <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> by 10 to 20 %, while still maintaining ideal crop/pasture yields. In the short term, the application of precision irrigation systems in fields with windbreaks can have farm level benefits of improved water use and reduced nitrogen/phosphorus leaching.

Water saving irrigation techniques, side roll and center pivot sprinkler systems, are analyzed as alternatives of gravity irrigation. Natural gas, electricity, and diesel fuel are commonly available energy sources for pumping groundwater in the area. Four representative farm size groups, five crops, and five irrigation techniques are adopted for representative farm mixed integer programming models. The problem is treated as a complete switch from one energy source to another and twelve separate sets of computer data are developed for four farm sizes and three energy sources. Sensitivity analyses based on cotton lint price and natural gas cost variations are analyzed. The results are aggregated to determine the regional level impacts of energy source changes, cotton lint price declines, and natural gas price increases. The major conclusion of these analyses is that upland cotton is a dominant crop with wheat using residual land and water. July water and available land restrict the crop production. Increasing energy costs reduce the total <b>annual</b> <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> through adopting the water saving sprinkler systems and/or crops. Under the initial conditions (cotton lint price is at $ 58. 11 /cwt and natural gas price is at $. 1167 per therm) the farmers generate gross returns that cover their annual total cost.

40|$|Water {{harvesting}} {{systems have}} improved productivity in various regions in sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, {{they can help}} retain water in landscapes, build resilience against droughts and dry spells, and thereby contribute to sustainable agricultural intensification. However, there is no strong empirical evidence that shows the effects of intensification of water harvesting on upstream–downstream social–ecological systems at a landscape scale. In this paper we develop a decision support system (DSS) for locating and sizing water harvesting ponds in a hydrological model, which enables assessments of water harvesting intensification on upstream–downstream ecosystem services in meso-scale watersheds. The DSS was used with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for a case-study area located in the Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia. We found that supplementary irrigation in combination with nutrient application increased simulated teff (Eragrostis tef, staple crop in Ethiopia) production up to three times, compared to the current practice. Moreover, after supplemental irrigation of teff, the excess water was used for dry season onion production of 7. 66 t/ha (median).

Described principles of complex analysis of graph of diurnal <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> will promote detection hidden common features in the <b>water</b> <b>consumption.</b> This will allow to perform construction the family of typical graphs <b>water</b> <b>consumption.</b> ??????????? ??????? ??????? ???????????? ?????? ??????????????? ? ???????? ????????????? ????????????? ??? ?????????? ????? ???????????? ?????????????????? ?????? ??????????. ????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ????????? ??????????????? ? ????? ??????? ???????? ? ????????????? ????????. ??? ???????? ??????? ????????? ??????????????? ???????????? ????????? ?????????????, ??????? ???????? ???????????? ? ???????????????? ??????????. ??? ????????? ??????? ????????????? ???????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????, ??????????????? ???????? ???????. ??? ????????? ???????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????? ???????? ??????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ?????? ??????? ???? ? ???????? ????????? ?????. ????????? ???????? ???????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ??????????????? ?? ?????? ???? ?????? ????????? ???????????????, ?????????????? ????????? ? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ?????????????, ???????????? ????????? ??????? ????? ???????????? ? ???????????????...|$|R
40|$|Fresh <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{considerations}} for sustainable water system designs of buildings. This study proposes a simple statistical benchmarking model for some apartments in Hong Kong. The model was tested in a case study based on an existing domestic <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> survey in which the average <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> distribution of 60 apartments in Hong Kong were selected as the input parameters of the simulation model. The distribution was compared with the Hong Kong global fresh <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> patterns to derive the <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> benchmarks for apartments in the region. This simple model could be useful for indicating the extreme cases of <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> and promoting the sustainability of <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> without inclusive measurements.

40|$|Since the {{independence}} resumption of Latvia in 1990, <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> {{in the country}} has decreased few times. Accordingly, domestic hot <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> in the household sector reduced. <b>Water</b> <b>consumption</b> decrease was caused by extensive <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> meters’ installation, increased heat supply tariffs, and domestic hot water savings activities. In this paper there are presented the results of domestic hot <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> measurements, which were done in a dwelling house in Riga. The results were worked up using the prescribed formulas of building normative LBN 221 - 98. The fluctuations of irregularity coefficient depending on domestic hot <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> decrease was analysed in this research; as well as domestic hot <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> fluctuations in the day time and the maximal consumption value. Using the received results, domestic hot <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> profiles were prepared. The results of measuring show that the actual consumption values are less than the design values...|$|R
