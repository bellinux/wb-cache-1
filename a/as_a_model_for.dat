5|$|The curve-shortening flow was {{originally}} studied <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> annealing of metal sheets.

In pure mathematics, the curve-shortening flow {{can be used to}} find closed geodesics on Riemannian manifolds, and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the behavior of higher-dimensional flows.|$|E

5|$|Bogdan-Pitești was {{the subject}} of several {{anonymous}} sketches, including two 1896 vignettes, published in Adevărul, and a 1917 drawing signed Correggio. He is also depicted in an affectionate cartoon published in 1914 by Petrescu Găină. Domnica Bogdan herself sat <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> various artists, and was notably depicted in works by Camil Ressu, Pallady and the Bulgarian-born painter Pascin. In 1920, Bogdan-Pitești commissioned Paciurea to complete a portrait bust of Domnica. The same year, Dimitrescu painted her an oil-on-cardboard portrait in dominant shades of brown (with touches of red and gray). Artists who illustrated works by Bogdan-Pitești include, in addition to himself, George Demetrescu Mirea, Ion Georgescu and Satmari.|$|E
5|$|Eveline was an {{inspiration}} for many of Balzac's characters. She {{can be seen as}} the model for La Fosseue, Mme Claes, Modesta Mignon, Ursule Mirouet, Adelina Houlot, and especially Eugenie Grandet and Mme de Mortsauf. There is less agreement among scholars on whether she was also the inspiration for more negative characters such as Fedora and lady Dudley, as Balzac seems to have used her mostly <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> more positive personas. His works also mention numerous characters named Eve or Eveline, and have several dedications to her.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, {{construction}} resumed on roadways throughout Ontario. The expressway between Highland Creek and Oshawa {{was completed}} in December 1947, while other sections languished. The Toronto–Barrie Highway was {{the primary focus of}} the Department of Highways at the time, and the onset of the Korean War in 1950 stalled construction again. Despite the delays, highway minister George Doucett officially announced the plans for construction of the new trans-provincial expressway that year, with the Toronto to Oshawa expressway serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the design. Work on the most important link, the Toronto Bypass, began in 1951, but it would not open with that name.|$|E

A pioneering minority-rights association, the LRA waged a nearly ten-year campaign against segregated public transportation in New York City.

The university was founded as the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, one of the country's first {{institutions of higher education}} to teach scientific agriculture. After the introduction of the Morrill Act, the college became coeducational and expanded its curriculum beyond agriculture. Today, MSU {{is one of the largest}} universities in the United States (in terms of enrollment) and has approximately 552,000 living alumni worldwide.|$|E
