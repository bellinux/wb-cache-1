This type of attack was counter to German pledges to adhere cruiser warfare, which required that ships be <b>allowed</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the crews to escape before any attack could commence. UB-43s fifth victim, Welsh Prince, was on another list of 107 British ships sunk whose lifeboats had been fired upon by German submarines.|$|E

This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning.

This <b>allowed</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.

25|$|The {{successful}} siege {{upon the}} stone and earthen fort required the prolonged bombardment by the British Navy {{under the command of}} Admiral Howe, also involving land batteries, lasting from September 26 to November 16, 1777. The standoff and defense of the fort <b>allowed</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Washington and the Continental Army to safely deploy for the Battle of White Marsh and its subsequent withdrawal to Valley Forge. Washington received warnings from Generals Porter and Lee, stationed on the Schuylkill River at Philadelphia, that the British were making communication runs across the river at night using small boats. In a letter of November 4, Washington advised Hazelwood to do all he could to stop the activity. Hazelwood's efforts to end the communications were less than effectual. Several days before the fall of the fort Washington dispatched another letter to Hazelwood inquiring about his status, urging that if at all possible to remain at his station with the fleet after the fort has fallen so as to hinder and prolong British operations long enough to allow the river to freeze over, preventing passage of supply ships into Philadelphia until the spring thaw.|$|E
25|$|While Su Shi {{concentrated}} {{on making the}} lives of the local people in his charge better, and pursued his poetry which his position <b>allowed</b> <b>time</b> <b>for,</b> Wang Anshi's policies went awry. Were they bad policies, or were they badly implemented, or were climatic changes leading to drought and poor harvests to blame? These are all serious questions, important to historians of the time, and nowhere near to being definitively answered; but, they are rather subject of great scholarly debate. What is certain is that Su Shi was exiled until emperor Shenzong became somewhat disillusioned with Wang Anshi (and the powerful empress dowager had never been much of a fan of his). The Kaifeng merchants were becoming angry at the price inflation of wholesale goods together with additional tax increases and imposition of fees; and in north of the country a major drought followed by horrible famine occurred in 1074, displacing thousands of refugees (Murck, 37-38). In late 1075, this was followed by a spectacular comet, traditionally viewed as a sign of great changes on earth, even the fall of dynasties (Murck, 48) These events helped to lead Wang Anshi into a gentle but real exile, and to lead to the restoration of Su Shi and other banished officials to positions of power and respect, aided by empress dowager Cao. However, this was just the warm-up to a bitter and deadly political struggle between the two factions in the ensuing years: now both groups had had their ranks decimated, and all sorts of charges of criminal impropriety were our would be filed. Ouyang Xiu had even already been charged with incest, and placed in early retirement: the battle lines drawn, and Su Shi would soon be charged with treason to the state.|$|E

500|$|A {{series of}} reforms to the Russian army {{had begun in}} 1802, {{creating}} regiments [...] of three battalions, each battalion having four companies. [...] The defeats of Austerlitz, Eylau, and Friedland led to important additional reforms, though continuous fighting {{in the course of}} three wars with France, two with Sweden, and two with the Ottoman Empire had not <b>allowed</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> these to be fully implemented and absorbed. A divisional system was introduced in 1806, and corps were established in 1812. Prussian influence may be seen in the organizational setup. By the time of Borodino the Russian Army had changed greatly from the force which met the French in 1805–1807.|$|E
500|$|Shooting {{started on}} July 19, 1965, {{several days later}} than {{originally}} scheduled.

500|$|In the meantime, the {{negotiations}} <b>allowed</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> loyalists to enter Saigon and rescue the president. Khanh used the remaining communication lines to message senior officers outside Saigon. The Fifth Division of Colonel Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, a future president, brought infantry forces from Biên Hòa, a town north of Saigon. The Seventh Division of Colonel Trần Thiện Khiêm brought in seven infantry battalions and tanks from the Second Armored Battalion from Mỹ Tho, {{a town in}} the Mekong Delta south of Saigon. Khiêm was a Catholic with ties to Diệm's older brother, Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục. Khanh also convinced Lê Nguyên Khang, the acting head of the Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps to send the 1st and 2nd Marine Battalions. Rangers were called into Saigon from the western town of Tây Ninh. Assistant Secretary of Defense Nguyễn Đình Thuận phoned Durbrow and discussed the impending standoff between the incoming loyalists and the rebels. Durbrow said [...] "I hope that the Revolutionary Committee and President Diệm can get together and agree to cooperate as a civil war could only benefit communists. If {{one side or the}} other has to make some concessions in order [...] reach an agreement, I believe that would be desirable to ensure unity against the communists." [...] Durbrow was worried that if he sided with one faction over the other, and that group was defeated, the United States would be saddled with a hostile regime.|$|E

[...] Rhodes concluded that Reconstruction had failed. Lynch disagreed. While not all its goals had been accomplished, ratification of the 14th and 15th Amendments made it a success, as all people of color were granted citizenship, which could not be restricted by race or color, and they were granted suffrage nationally. Lynch argued that, [...] "The failure of the Reconstruction legislation was not due so much to the change of sentiment in the North as an unwise interpretation of these laws." ...|$|E

The entire 3rd Line deployed into skirmish formation and swarmed uphill. Its attack failed to dislodge the Austrians, but it <b>allowed</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the 57th Line Infantry Regiment (called [...] "the Terrible") to organize a second assault. The 57th Line's charge carried the first ridge, but stalled before a second ridge. In the teeth of intense musketry and cannon fire, the highly trained French infantry deployed into line and returned fire. By this time the 3rd Line had reformed behind the 57th and took position on its right. Farther to the right, the 10th Light Infantry surged forward against the Austrian left flank where they forced an Austrian battery to retire to the rear. The new attack faltered and fell {{back to the first}} ridge when it ran into a strong position on the second ridge.|$|E
