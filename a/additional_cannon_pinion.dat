50|$|Hour wheel - which {{fits over}} {{the shaft of}} the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion,</b> and whose shaft holds the hour hand. The hour wheel rotates once for every 12 {{rotations}} of the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{mainspring}} that powers the watch, {{a spiral}} ribbon of spring steel, is inside a cylindrical barrel, with the outer {{end of the}} mainspring attached to the barrel. The force of the mainspring turns the barrel. The barrel has gear teeth around the outside that turn the center wheel once per hour — this wheel has a shaft that goes through the dial. On the dial side the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> is attached with a friction fit (allowing it to slide when setting the hands) and the minute hand {{is attached to the}} <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion.</b> The <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> drives a small 12-to-1 reduction gearing called the motion work that turns the hour wheel and hand once for every 12 revolutions of the minute hand.|$|R

50|$|Minute wheel - Its pinion {{drives the}} hour wheel. During setting, this {{is driven by}} the {{intermediate}} wheel in the keyless work and it turns both the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> and the hour wheel, moving the hands.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> - a pinion with {{a hollow}} shaft that fits {{friction}} tight over the center wheel shaft, projects through the face, {{and holds the}} minute hand. While the timepiece is not being set, this is turned by the center wheel, and drives the minute wheel. While being set it is turned by the setting mechanism, in modern clocks a setting knob {{on the back of}} the clock. In watches during setting this is turned by the minute wheel, which is turned by the keyless work. In older clocks the setting was done by opening the face and manually pushing the minute hand, which rotated the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> directly.|$|R
5000|$|The {{motion work}} is the small 12-to-1 {{reduction}} gear train that turns the timepiece's hour hand from the minute hand. [...] It {{is attached to the}} going train by the friction coupling of the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion,</b> so the minute and hour hands can be turned independently to set the timepiece. It is often located {{on the outside of the}} movement's front plate, just under the dial. It consists of: ...|$|R
50|$|Center {{or second}} wheel - which turns once per hour. Its pinion is turned by the teeth on the {{mainspring}} barrel in watches and spring driven clocks, {{and by the}} weight pulley in weight driven clocks. Its arbor projects {{through a hole in}} the face and drives, via a friction coupling, the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion,</b> which carries the minute hand. It also drives the pinion of the third wheel. In wrist watches with centre seconds, that is with the seconds hand pivoted coaxially with the minute and hour hands, this wheel is positioned off centre to allow the fourth wheel to be placed at the centre of the movement. In this arrangement the wheel is called the second wheel, because it is still the second wheel in the train but no longer at the centre of the movement.|$|R
25|$|Whydah {{was then}} fitted with 10 <b>additional</b> <b>cannon</b> by its new captain, and 150 members of Bellamy's crew were {{detailed}} to man the vessel. They razeed the ship by clearing {{the top deck}} of the pilot's cabin, removing the slave barricade, and getting rid of other features that made her top heavy.|$|R
50|$|A {{separate}} {{set of gears}} {{called the}} keyless work winds the mainspring when the crown is rotated, and when the crown is pulled out a short distance allow the hands to be turned to set the watch. The stem attached to the crown has a gear called the clutch or castle wheel, with two rings of teeth that project axially from the ends. When the stem is pushed in, the outer teeth turn the ratchet wheel {{on top of the}} mainspring barrel, which turns the shaft that the inner end of the mainspring is attached to, winding the mainspring tighter around the shaft. A spring-loaded pawl or click presses against the ratchet teeth, preventing the mainspring from unwinding. When the stem is pulled out, the inner teeth of the castle wheel engage with a gear which turns the minute wheel. When the crown is turned, the friction coupling of the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> allows the hands to be rotated.|$|R
5000|$|Slava's own {{mechanical}} movements feature two mainspring barrels coupled {{together with}} an idler gear. There are many versions of the movement including manual wind 2414 and 2428 (double date)and self-winding 2416 and 2427 (double date). The movements are quite sensitive to shocks due to thin balance staff. Other frequent problems include premature wear of rotor bearing and the clutch driving the hands (not a typical <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion).</b> Also the date indicator malfunctions are common. The movements are thus considered unreliable, especially compared to other Russian calibres. Earlier the 2nd Moscow Factory produced movements derived from an old pre-war French movement, the Lip [...] "T-15" [...] (also some Poljot movements were derived from this French brand), and produced under license (brands Pobeda and Start). In addition to that, for relative brief periods, Slava also produced its own electronic movements using tuning fork and quartz systems. Some Slava watches were produced under Sekonda brand names.|$|R
25|$|Renard {{arrived in}} Plymouth on 12 January 1799. She {{sat there for}} six months, finally {{undergoing}} fitting between July 1799 and January 1800. While undergoing fitting she may have received <b>additional</b> <b>cannons</b> and extensive upperworks to hold them. There is some question though whether she in fact received the additional armament and upperworks (see below). Commander Peter Spicer commissioned Renard in August 1799 for the Channel.|$|R
50|$|Optional 0.30 caliber machine guns, mortar launchers, rocket {{projectors}} and <b>additional</b> 20mm <b>cannons</b> (and captured 23mm anti-tank guns) as required/available.|$|R
25|$|The Confederates {{were led}} by Charles L. Pyron and William Read Scurry. During the battle on March 26, Pyron had his {{battalion}} of the 2nd Texas Mounted Rifles, four companies of the 5th Texas Mounted Rifles under Maj. John Shropshire and two cannons. Scurry's force included nine companies of the 4th Texas Mounted Rifles under Maj. Henry Raguet, five companies of the 7th Texas Mounted Rifles under Maj. Powhatan Jordan and three <b>additional</b> <b>cannons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{player can}} fire {{four types of}} weapons: Cannon, Phoenix Air Intercept Missiles, Maverick {{air-to-ground}} missiles, and Hawk bombs. The cannon is the only weapon with an unlimited supply. The rest of the weapons must be purchased between missions after docking with the space station. The purchases are made with credits obtained through the levels by destroying all aliens that are in a group. Purchasing <b>additional</b> <b>cannons</b> allows the player to fire much more rapidly.|$|R
50|$|Smith {{sailed to}} Acre {{and helped the}} Turkish {{commander}} Jezzar Pasha reinforce the defences and old walls and supplied him with <b>additional</b> <b>cannon</b> manned by sailors and Marines from his ships. He also used his command of the sea to capture the French siege artillery being sent by ship from Egypt and to deny the French army {{the use of the}} coastal road from Jaffa by bombarding the troops from the sea.|$|R

50|$|For {{all intents}} and purposes, the vessel was still {{unfinished}} {{at the time of}} the battle, with some workmen, including riggers and carpenters, still laboring on her completion right up to the days before. According to one source, {{at the time of the}} battle, the Confiance mounted 37 guns but actually carried 39, with two <b>additional</b> <b>cannon</b> aboard but having not yet been mounted. Admiralty records show that in reality, she mounted only 16 12-pounders when she went into battle.|$|R
50|$|A Royal Navy {{flotilla}} under Commodore Sidney Smith {{helped to}} reinforce the Ottoman defences and supplied the city with <b>additional</b> <b>cannon</b> manned by sailors and marines. Smith used his command of the sea to capture the French siege artillery being sent by a flotilla of gunboats from Egypt and to bombard the coastal road from Jaffa. An artillery expert from the fleet, Antoine Le Picard de Phélippeaux, then redeployed against Napoleon's forces the artillery pieces which the British had intercepted.|$|R
60|$|On the 12th Colonel Lee {{determined}} {{to attempt a}} storm of the stockade on the left, and sent forward a sergeant and six men, with lighted combustibles, to {{set fire to the}} abattis. The whole of them were killed before effecting their purpose. A number of <b>additional</b> <b>cannon</b> now arrived from Augusta, and so heavy and incessant a fire was opened upon the stockade from three batteries that on the 17th it was no longer tenable, and the garrison evacuated it in the night.|$|R
50|$|While {{the tests}} were proceeding, a second prototype, {{incorporating}} the changes, the most obvious {{of which was the}} removal of the windowed corridor in the fuselage and its replacement by additional fuel tanks, was being built. The armament was increased to six cannon in the nose, two in the gunner's post and one <b>additional</b> <b>cannon</b> in the floor of the gunner's post. As the second prototype was being built, the Citroën company was preparing to mass-produce the aircraft at their Paris works, deliveries planned to begin late in 1940.|$|R

2500|$|During {{this process}} Nelson and the {{squadron}} had to retreat off-shore {{for five days}} to allow a gale to pass, but Hood appeared off Port-Agra on 27 June in Victory, and landed <b>additional</b> <b>cannon.</b> The British admiral had been distracted by a short French naval campaign which had left the French fleet blockaded in Gourjean Bay near Fréjus. The British batteries were not all in place until 4 July, with each fort facing a mortar battery, each supported by two cannon batteries. These were emplaced overnight, so that the French were reportedly unaware of their presence until the barrage commenced; one battery was only [...] from Fort Mozello.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of each level, the player chooses the {{location}} of their fort from a number of options. This location is then surrounded by a wall to form a castle, which the player can then place cannons within. After this, an attacking round commences, followed by a repair round, where any damage to the castle must be repaired. If the player manages to survive the repair phase (by surrounding at least one castle within a time limit), he is given {{a short amount of time}} to place <b>additional</b> <b>cannons</b> within the walls of his fort (if he made room for them), after which the battle resumes.|$|R
5000|$|Trunajaya's forces {{met their}} first {{significant}} resistance in Jepara. In {{response to the}} rebellion, Amangkurat had installed a military man, Angabei Wangsadipa as governor in Jepara overseeing the entire northern coast. Subsequently, the town's defenses had been reinforced and <b>additional</b> <b>cannons</b> had been placed. Jepara's defender also had help from a Dutch East India Company (VOC) force of 200 men, who was reinforced by sea [...] "just in time". They arrived there on 20 November 1676 and begin besieging the city. The joint Mataram-VOC defense, {{as well as with}} quarrel between the Madurese and Makassarese elements of the attackers, caused the attack to ultimately fail.|$|R
50|$|The T-38 {{retained}} many {{design features}} of the T-37A, including its repurposed GAZ-AA engine and hand-operated turret. The turret was moved from the right to the left-hand side of the tank, switching the driver and commander positions compared to the T-37A. The T-38 also had a slightly wider and lower profile than its predecessor, providing an advantage in buoyancy that made the cork buoys used on the T-37A unnecessary. While the production-model T-38 was only armed with a 7.62mm DT machine gun, the initial prototype vehicle also included a 20mm ShVAK cannon mounted on the driver's position. This was removed after it was determined the <b>additional</b> <b>cannon</b> impaired the driver's ability to control the tank.|$|R
5|$|In the Age of Sail, {{deception}} {{was often}} used by ships, and paint was applied ad hoc by ships' captains for temporary tactical advantage. A ship might be painted {{to look like}} another, it might have its cannon ports hidden by painted canvas to look harmless, or it might have <b>additional</b> <b>cannon</b> ports painted on to appear more powerful. For example, {{in one of his}} battles during 1778–1782, American privateer Jonathan Haraden hid the guns of his ship the General Pickering, to appear {{as if it were a}} slow merchant ship. Haraden allowed his ship to be approached at close range by a much faster British privateer, then he quickly pulled the painted canvas away and delivered a full broadside, capturing the enemy.|$|R
5000|$|When the Confederates reached Glasgow, {{they laid}} siege to the town. Four pieces of Rebel {{artillery}} commenced shelling {{the city at}} 5 AM on October 15, 1864, and continued firing until 1 PM. <b>Additional</b> <b>cannon</b> were deployed to support the infantry assault, which began at 7 AM as Rebel soldiers advanced into Glasgow from multiple directions. [...] Hereford Hill, a nearby promontory which the Union soldiers had fortified, was also brought under attack. [...] After fierce resistance, the Federals were compelled to fall back from the town to their breastworks on the hill, but not before blowing up the Glasgow city hall, {{which they had been}} using to store their munitions. [...] The ensuing explosion destroyed a half-block of downtown Glasgow.|$|R
5|$|The Battle of Cedar Creek {{occurred}} on October 19, 1864. Jubal Early's Confederate Army {{appeared to have}} a victory until General Sheridan rallied his troops to a successful counterattack. Although Union casualties were more than double those of the Confederates, this battle is considered a Union victory, and Confederate troops were driven from the battlefield. The Union troops recaptured all of their artillery lost earlier in the battle, and 22 <b>additional</b> <b>cannons</b> belonging to Early's army. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry {{did not participate in}} this battle until near the end. The regiment advanced toward Front Royal right before the final cavalry charge by Merritt's and Custer's divisions. This positioning prevented the Confederate cavalry under General Lunsford L. Lomax from flanking the Union force. The Union victory helped President Abraham Lincoln get re-elected a month later.|$|R
5|$|A pair of towers {{stand on}} the river's edge a short {{distance}} on either side from the main building. They were originally two-storyed open-backed structures with gun platforms situated on their first floors, providing flanking fire down {{the line of the}} ditch around the castle's perimeter. They were later adapted for use as accommodation, with their backs closed with bricks and the towers increased in height to provide a third storey. Traces of the gun embrasures can still be seen {{at the point where the}} original roofline was. The South Tower was said to have been for the use of the castle's governor, though their lack of comfort meant that successive governors declined to live there. The two towers are linked to the main building by a crenallated curtain wall where <b>additional</b> <b>cannon</b> were emplaced in two embrasures on the north parapet and one on the south.|$|R
25|$|Princess Amelia's Battery {{was first}} armed in 1732. Three decades later, during the Spanish War of 1762, {{there were six}} cannons at the battery, four 6-pounders and two 9-pounders. By 1771, Princess Amelia's Battery had five embrasures {{directed}} in front and three <b>additional</b> <b>cannons.</b> There were half a dozen guns behind embrasures by 1773. Several years later, during the Great Siege of Gibraltar, many of the emplacements on Willis's Plateau, including those of Princess Amelia's Battery, sustained severe damage. Of the fortifications of Gibraltar, the batteries on Willis's Plateau received {{the brunt of the}} attack from the Spanish during the siege. Gilbard and Drinkwater Bethune, among others, related the story of a shot which found its way through an embrasure in Princess Amelia's Battery, hitting four of the soldiers, and amputating between three and seven lower extremities in the process, depending on the source.|$|R
500|$|Nevertheless, {{the second}} barrage {{of the fort}} began on 1 June; by then, Bergholtz had 13 <b>additional</b> <b>cannon</b> at his disposal. The barrage lasted until 6 June, {{as a result of}} which [...] "there was made a great breach, that two battalions were lined up on either side to take the city". During those six days, there were a total of 2,975 mortar shots and 1,539 from cannon. The Swedish fired 7,464 shots from cannon and 394 from mortars. Both the first and second barrages had a similar number of shots fired, but the second barrage was a lot more devastating to the Swedish. This was due to several factors; the shots fired during the second {{bombardment}} used higher-caliber ammunition and did greater damage per round, and the rate of fire was much more intense. The first bombardment took a month, whereas the second only took six days.|$|R

50|$|The Marquis de Lafayette, {{accompanied}} by his son Georges Washington and a personal staff, arrived in the United States at Staten Island on Sunday, August 15, 1824. His arrival was greeted with a thirteen-gun salute from the batteries of Fort Diamond, {{accompanied by}} numerous <b>additional</b> <b>cannon</b> volleys from U.S. Navy and merchant ships in harbor. As the marquis' entourage prepared to make the short trip to Manhattan, it was intercepted {{by one of the}} sons of Vice-President of the United States Daniel D. Tompkins who arrived in a steamboat as an emissary of the city government. The young Tompkins requested Lafayette delay his entrance into Manhattan as the city was observing the Sabbath and {{would not be able to}} welcome him appropriately. The trip to Manhattan was, therefore, postponed to Monday, August 16. That evening a reception was held for Lafayette by fellow companions of the Cincinnati.|$|R
