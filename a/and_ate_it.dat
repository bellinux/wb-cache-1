5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child <b>and</b> <b>ate</b> <b>it.</b> Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E

Within days of his deposition, Sihanouk, now in Beijing, broadcast an appeal to the people to resist the usurpers. Demonstrations and riots occurred (mainly in areas contiguous to PAVN/Viet Cong controlled areas), but no nationwide groundswell threatened the government.

500|$|Five years later, a local historian, J.G.Hastings, wrote a manuscript, {{entitled}} The History of the Coorong, {{which proved}} {{influential in the}} development of the legend of James Brown. In it, Hastings elaborated on the poisoning incident in which Brown had supposedly been involved. By this account, Brown, responding to repeated attacks on his livestock, poisoned some flour and left it accessible to local Aboriginal people, who subsequently stole the flour <b>and</b> <b>ate</b> <b>it,</b> with many dying as a result. Having set the trap, Brown then rode for Adelaide to establish an alibi, swimming across the Murray mouth on his way. According to Hastings, when the case was investigated by the police, Brown's ride to Adelaide [...] "set him in good stead". Hastings wrote that at Brown's trial, it was claimed that it was impossible that Brown had poisoned the flour and appeared in Adelaide immediately thereafter.|$|E
500|$|The legend narrates {{the tale}} behind the {{tradition}} of offering the Ucchishta, which otherwise is a taboo in Hinduism. Once, Shiva {{on a visit to}} Vishnu's abode Vaikuntha, saw that a few food grains (Ucchishta) had fallen on the ground after Vishnu finished his meal. [...] Shiva quickly picked up a grain and swallowed it. Unbeknownst to him, half of it stuck to his beard. [...] When he returned to his abode, the sage Narada saw the half grain on Shiva's beard, <b>and</b> <b>ate</b> <b>it.</b> [...] Parvati, Shiva's consort, was upset that her rightful share of Vishnu's prasad had been eaten by Narada. In a peeved mood, she went to Vishnu and complained. Vishnu pacified her saying that in the Kali Yuga (the present era as per Hindu beliefs), she would live at Puri as Vimala, and would daily eat the remnants of his food.|$|E

500|$|Patrick Breen began {{keeping a}} diary on November 20. He {{primarily}} concerned {{himself with the}} weather, marking the storms and how much snow had fallen, but gradually began to include references to God and religion in his entries. Life at Truckee Lake was miserable. The cabins were cramped and filthy, and it snowed so much that people were unable to go outdoors for days. Diets soon consisted of oxhide, strips of which were boiled to make a [...] "disagreeable" [...] glue-like jelly. Ox and horse bones were boiled repeatedly to make soup, and they became so brittle that they would crumble upon chewing. Sometimes they were softened by being charred and eaten. Bit by bit, the Murphy children picked apart the oxhide rug that lay {{in front of their}} fireplace, roasted it in the fire, <b>and</b> <b>ate</b> <b>it.</b> After the departure of the snowshoe party, two-thirds of the emigrants at Truckee Lake were children. Mrs. Graves was in charge of eight, and Levinah Murphy and Eleanor Eddy together took care of nine. Emigrants caught and ate mice that strayed into their cabins. Many of the people at Truckee Lake were soon weakened and spent most of their time in bed. Occasionally one would {{be able to make the}} full-day trek to see the Donners. News came that Jacob Donner and three hired men had died. One of them, Joseph Reinhardt, confessed on his deathbed that he had murdered Wolfinger. George Donner's hand had become infected, which left four men to work at the Donner camp.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} listed various possible directors, but {{at first}} did not consider Matthew Vaughn because he started working on The Last Stand before backing out. After seeing Vaughn's satirical superhero film Kick-Ass (2010), Kinberg decided to contact Vaughn {{to see if he}} would be interested in First Class. When Fox offered Vaughn the [...] "chance to reboot X-Men and put your stamp all over it", he first thought the studio was joking, but accepted after discovering that it was to be set in the 1960s. The director stated that First Class would become the opportunity to combine many of his dream projects: [...] "I got my cake <b>and</b> <b>ate</b> <b>it,</b> managed to do an X-Men movie, and a Bond thing, and a Frankenheimer political thriller at the same time". Vaughn signed on as Singer's replacement in May 2010, and Fox subsequently announced a June 3, 2011 release date. Vaughn also rewrote the script with his screenwriting partner Jane Goldman, adding new characters and changing existing character arcs and dynamics—for instance, the idea of a love triangle between Xavier, Magneto and Moira MacTaggert was cut. The character of Sunspot was also cut, as the director felt that [...] "we didn't have enough time or money" [...] to make the character work. Vaughn and Goldman considered including mentions to the Civil Rights Movement, but ultimately the director felt that [...] "I had enough political subplot in this movie". Vaughn stated that his biggest concern was to both make Erik and Charles' friendship believable given the short timespan of the film, and on how the character of Magneto was built - [...] "Shaw was the villain, but now you're seeing all those elements of Shaw going into Magneto." [...] An action scene that was to have been set in a dream sequence with revolving rooms was scrapped after the release of Inception (2010).|$|E

It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible.

Hines had had hardly anything to eat for four days, having had to walk about [...] to Cheyenne after his horse gave out. About two miles into his hike, he had been given a few scraps of food by a hermit, after which he continued to Cheyenne, with five inches of snow on the ground. The counter person initially refused the order, saying that {{it would be impossible to}} finish it, but Hines was eventually provided with a large platter of ham and eggs <b>and</b> <b>ate</b> <b>it</b> all.

He also noted that there were some similarities between the murders that Bittrolff was convicted of, and some of the crime scenes at Gilgo Beach. Bittrolff was a carpenter who lived in Manorville, where the torsos of official LISK victims Jessica Taylor and [...] "Jane Doe No. 6" [...] were recovered.
