25|$|Because {{the teams}} were from New York City and Boston, which are {{approximately}} {{three and a}} half hours apart by car, the Super Bowl echoed the fierce rivalry between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox in Major League Baseball, games of which are often televised by Fox.

Many old-time New Englanders, in fact, grew up rooting for the Giants before Boston got its AFL franchise in 1960, and are more accustomed to rooting against the Jets. Giants fans, however, discussed their great hatred for the Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles. Many Giants fans also wore hats <b>and</b> <b>shirts</b> of the New York Mets and the New York Rangers as part of discussing their hatred for the Eagles.|$|E
25|$|Police {{organisation}} {{and uniform}} history has varied throughout the British Overseas Territories. Uniforms have {{often had to}} be adapted to local climates. The Bermuda Police Service has followed the trends of UK police forces in its dress, having adopted dark blue tunics, trousers, and helmets at its inception. After the appointment of Police Commissioner Colin Coxall, in 1995 (formerly of the Metropolitan Police), the four-pocket jackets and helmets were reserved for ceremonial or public relations occasions, with more comfortable bomber jackets and woollen pullovers adopted. In the Bermuda Police, only officers wear white shirts, with sergeants and constables wearing light blue ones. During the summer months, the long trousers are replaced with Bermuda shorts. The traditional image of a Bermuda policeman {{in the minds of}} summer visitors is helmeted, with knee socks and shorts. During, and for a short time after, the Second World War, influenced by the large numbers of military personnel on the island, the Bermuda Police took to wearing military-style khaki shorts <b>and</b> <b>shirts</b> during the summer months, but this fad quickly passed.|$|E
25|$|Christofle Charvet {{created the}} first shirtmaker store in Paris, for which the new term chemisier (shirtmaker) was coined. Previously, shirts were {{generally}} made by linen keepers with fabric provided by the customer, but in this store of a new kind, clients were measured, fabric selected <b>and</b> <b>shirts</b> made on site. The development of this specialty trade was favored by a change in men's fashion, with more importance given to the waistcoat and the shirt collar, which called for more propositions for the shirt front and a technical change. Previously, shirts were cut by linen keepers entirely of rectangles and squares. There were no shaping seams and no need for shirt patterns. The new interest for a closer fitting shirt led to curving the armhole and neckline or adding a shoulder yoke, by application to the shirt of tailoring techniques. The new kind of shirt was called chemise à pièce (yoked shirt). Alan Flusser credits Christofle Charvet with the original design of a collar that could be turned down or folded, much {{in the manner of}} contemporary collars, and the concept of the detachable collar.|$|E
