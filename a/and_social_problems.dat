40|$|An {{integrative}} {{model in}} which perfectionism <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving were hypothesized to have additive and interactive effects in predicting psychological maladjustment (viz., depressive symptoms and suicide ideation) was proposed and tested {{in a sample of}} 371 college students. Results of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving added significant incremental validity in predicting scores on measures of depressive symptoms and suicide ideation beyond what was accounted for by perfectionism. Moreover, a significant Perfectionism × <b>Social</b> <b>Problem</b> Solving interaction was found in predicting each of the maladjustment measures after accounting for the influences of both perfectionism <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving. These results are taken to provide preliminary support for an additive and interactive prediction model of psychological maladjustment involving perfectionism <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving...|$|R

5|$|Although he {{returned}} to parliament in 1931, Bruce's service in the Lyons Government was brief. Instead he pursued an international career, accepting appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in 1933. Bruce became an influential figure in British government circles and at the League of Nations, emerging as a tireless advocate for international cooperation on economic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>problems,</b> especially those facing the developing world. Particularly passionate on improving global nutrition, Bruce {{was one of the}} key figures in the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization, serving as the first chairman of its governing council. He was the first Australian to sit in the House of Lords, as well as the first Chancellor of the Australian National University. Although his diplomatic career went largely unnoticed in Australia, he continued throughout his life in London to vociferously advocate for Australian interests (particularly during World War II) and asked that his remains be returned to Canberra when he died in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Megadeth's lyrics often {{focus on}} death, war, politics, and religion. The lyricism centers on nihilistic themes, but {{occasionally}} deals with {{topics such as}} alienation <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>problems.</b> The earliest releases featured themes such as occultism, graphic violence, and Satanism. Nuclear warfare and government conspiracy were preoccupations on albums such as Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction. During Megadeth's commercial peak, Mustaine elaborated on more personal themes such as addiction and intimate relationships. For the lyrics on Cryptic Writings, Mustaine said {{that he wanted to}} write songs that had more appeal to a wider audience. The title of United Abominations is a satiric play on the name of the United Nations; Mustaine criticized the organization's ineffectiveness on a number of songs on that album. Later albums contained lyrics in a similar vein.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale Indian {{immigration}} to the Pacific coast of North America {{took place in the}} 20th century, especially from Punjab, which faced an economic depression. The Canadian government met this influx with legislation aimed at limiting the entry of South Asians into Canada and at restricting the political rights of those already in the country. The Punjabi community had hitherto been an important loyal force for the British Empire and the Commonwealth. The community had expected that its commitment would be honoured with the same welcome and rights which the British and colonial governments extended to British and white immigrants. The restrictive legislation fed growing discontent, protests and anti-colonial sentiments within the community. Faced with increasingly difficult situations, the community began organising itself into political groups. Many Punjabis also moved to the United States, but they encountered similar political <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>problems.</b> Meanwhile, India House and nationalist activism of Indian students had begun declining on the east coast of North America towards 1910, but activity gradually shifted west to San Francisco. The arrival at this time of Har Dayal from Europe bridged the gap between the intellectual agitators in New York and the predominantly Punjabi labour workers and migrants in the west coast, and laid the foundations of the Ghadar movement.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} Turkish theatre dates back {{thousands}} of years to ancient pagan rituals. The dances, music and songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of Anatolia millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated. These rituals later became theatrical shows. In the 10th century, a blend of traditions occurred between the Seljuk Turks {{and those of the}} inhabitants of Anatolia. The interaction between the various tribal societies paved the way for new plays. After the Tanzimat (Reformation) period, characters in Turkish theatre were modernized and plays were performed on European-style stages with the actors wearing European costumes. Following the declaration of the second Constitutional Monarchy in 1908, theatrical activities increased <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>problems</b> began to be reflected in the theatre as well as in historical plays. A theatrical conservatoire, Darülbedayi-i Osmani, was established in Istanbul in 1914. During the years of chaos and war, the Darülbedayi-i Osmani continued its activities and attracted the younger generation. Turkish playwrights emerged. Some wrote on romantic subjects, others were interested in social problems and still others dealt with nationalistic themes. There were even those who wrote musicals. In time, Turkish ladies began to appear on stage and this was indeed a revolution of the time, since female roles had only been played by actresses who were members of Turkey’s ethnic minorities. Today, theatre acts are performed by numerous private theatre companies and subsidized companies such as the Turkish State Theatres.|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} the Factor Analytic Structural Equations Model (FASEM) {{to test the}} {{plausibility}} of two nested causal models of depression, the Full Model and Restricted Model, in a 2 -month prospective study. Subjects were 103 undergraduate students. The Full Model deals with the causal relations among indices of life events, <b>social</b> interest, <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving, <b>and</b> depression across time. In contrast, causal relations among indices of life events and depression across time were assessed by the Restricted Model. Both models provided acceptable representations of the observed data. Although both models were accepted by 4 goodness-of-fit criteria, including the Chi-square goodness-of-fit test, the Full Model suggests the specification of more causal factors clarifies the effect of <b>social</b> interest <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving on depression, enables a more complete assessment of depression, and {{is consistent with a}} pluralistic view of depression (Craighead, Kennedy, Raczynski, & Dow, 1984). In the present study, two questions were addressed: (1) the causal relation between <b>social</b> interest <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving on depression, and (2) the magnitude of the causal impact of <b>social</b> interest <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving on depression. Contrary to predictions, significant paths from both <b>social</b> interest <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving to depression were not found. However, consistent with predictions, social interest had a stronger effect on depression than <b>social</b> <b>problem</b> solving. Directions for future research, theoretical implications, and possible applications of the Full Model are discussed...|$|R
