50|$|Bustos Dam {{also known}} as Angat <b>Afterbay</b> Regulator <b>Dam</b> is a small {{irrigation}} dam at Bustos, Bulacan is often mistaken by the locals as Angat Dam since it is located close to {{the nearby town of}} Angat. The project is located at Barangay Tibagan, Bustos, Bulacan, served by the Angat River. The main dam is about 18 meters above sea level. Among the 2.5-meter high, six-span dam’s main features are easily deflatable and inflatable rubber body, resistance to sedimentation, economical and having auto-deflation system.|$|R

50|$|The Thermalito Afterbay is a {{significantly}} larger reservoir {{than that of}} the Forebay, and sits just 2 mi south-west of {{the tail end of the}} Forebay, with only a 9100 ft canal connecting them. The Afterbay provides storage for the water required by the pumpback operation to Lake Oroville, helps regulate the power system, produces controlled flow in the Feather River downstream from the Oroville-Thermalito facilities, and provides recreation to the area. It also serves as a warming basin for agricultural water delivery to the numerous rice and grain fields just west of the Afterbay. The Afterbay has a maximum operating storage of , a water surface area of 4300 acre at max. storage, and a shoreline of 26 miles (at max. operating storage). Thermalito <b>Afterbay</b> <b>Dam,</b> at 42000 ft long, is the longest crest in the California State Water Project system. Construction on the Afterbay began in 1965 and was completed in 1968.|$|E
5000|$|The Keswick Dam {{is part of}} the CVP's [...] "Shasta Division," [...] {{which also}} {{includes}} the Shasta Dam. [...] Keswick Dam acts as Shasta <b>Dam’s</b> <b>afterbay,</b> stabilizing the erratic water flow released through Shasta power plant. Keswick Reservoir captures water diverted from the Trinity River through the Trinity River division. Keswick power plant further generates power using the Sacramento River.|$|R
50|$|The Folsom Lake {{reservoir}} {{is formed}} by Folsom Dam, built in 1955 {{to control and}} retain the American River. The dam and reservoir {{are part of the}} Folsom Project, which also includes the Nimbus <b>afterbay</b> reservoir and <b>dam</b> facilities. The Folsom Project, operated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, is part of the Central Valley Project, a multipurpose project that provides flood control, hydroelectricity, drinking water, and water for irrigation.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} {{includes a}} diversion dam extending {{at an angle}} into the river to divert water through the headgate into a canal flowing parallel to the river. The headgate structure was built of dressed local limestone, and is 35 ft wide, allowing a designed flow of 720 cuft L of water per second. Five iron gates controlled the flow. The headgate structure is intermittently inundated by water held in the Yellowtail <b>Dam</b> <b>Afterbay</b> reservoir.|$|R
50|$|The Bighorn River {{begins as}} the Wind River in the Rocky Mountains at Wind River Lake, near Two Ocean Mountain and {{the summit of}} Togwotee Pass. The Wind River flows {{southeast}} receiving the east fork of the Wind River from the north, and enters the Wind River Basin, flowing past Dubois and Johnstown, to Riverton, where it receives the Little Wind River. The river then changes direction to the northeast and then the north, flowing into Boysen Reservoir, which is formed by Boysen Dam. Below the dam it enters the Wind River Canyon, where the river narrows and forms many rapids. At {{the end of the}} canyon the Wind River widens out in an area called the Wedding of the Waters where it becomes the Bighorn River and enters the Bighorn Basin. The Bighorn continues northward, passing through Thermopolis, Worland, and Basin. At Greybull it receives the Greybull River, and about 30 mi north of that confluence it enters Bighorn Lake, where it is joined by the Shoshone River. North of the confluence with the Shoshone, the reservoir narrows as the river enters the Bighorn Canyon, where it crosses into Montana. At the end of the canyon, the river passes through Yellowtail Dam and <b>Afterbay</b> <b>Dam.</b> The river turns to the northeast and enters the Great Plains. At Hardin the river is joined by the Little Bighorn River. Approximately 50 mi downriver from the Little Bighorn, in Big Horn County, the Bighorn empties into the Yellowstone.|$|E
500|$|The {{construction}} of Shasta <b>Dam</b> and its <b>afterbay</b> (regulating downstream <b>dam),</b> Keswick Dam, in 1943 and 1950, respectively, severely impaired {{the capability of}} the Sacramento River to flush away pollutants from the mine. Acid mine drainage flowed, unfettered, down Spring Creek directly into the Keswick Reservoir, depositing contaminated sediment and turning {{a portion of the}} water a rusty red shade. Previously, the water would have continued down the creek into the river, and flushed to the Pacific Ocean. The pooling of the water, however, made it extremely difficult for the pollutants to be removed. From 1955 to 1962, open pit mining began on the site. At its peak, the mine discharged 5 tons of iron, [...] of copper, and [...] of zinc into the stream per day. By then, the water flowing down the drainage was so contaminated that it necessitated the {{construction of}} a holding dam, the Spring Creek Dam.|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{results of}} total mercury measurements in skinless fillets of sport fishes collected during August 2000, September–October 2002, and July 2003 from Lake Natoma, a small (8, 760 acre-feet) <b>afterbay</b> for Folsom <b>Dam</b> {{on the lower}} American River. The primary objective {{of the study was}} to determine if mercury concentrations in fillets approached or exceeded guidelines for human consumption. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) human-health action level for methylmercury in commercially caught fish is 1. 0 μg/g (microgram per gram); the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) human-health criterion for methylmercury residue in fish tissue is 0. 30 μg/g. Wet weight concentrations of total mercury in skinless fillets were as high as 0. 19 μg/g in bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), 0. 39 μg/g in redear sunfish (L. microlophus), 1. 02 μg/g in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), and 1. 89 μg/g in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). Maximum concentrations of mercury in other fish species varied from 0. 10 μg/g in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to 0. 56 μg/g in white catfish (Ameiurus catus). Altogether, 1 of 86 largemouth bass and 11 of 11 channel catfish exceeded the FDA human-health action level. In addition, 1 of 20 redear sunfish, 26 of 86 largemouth bass, 2 of 3 spotted bass (M. punctulatus), 1 of 1 brown bullhead (A. nebulosus), and 1 of 1 white catfish exceeded the USEPA human-health criterion. These results indicate that some fish species inhabiting Lake Natoma contain undesirably high concentrations of mercury in their skinless fillets...|$|R
