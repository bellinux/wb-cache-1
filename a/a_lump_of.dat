5|$|Hygrometer: Prototype {{hygrometers}} were devised {{and developed}} in the hills during the Western Han dynasty in Ancient China to elucidate mechanisms of long-range meteorological fluctuations. The Chinese used a bar of charcoal and <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> earth: its dry weight was taken and then compared with its damp weight after being exposed in the air. The differences in weight was used to tally the humidity level. Other techniques were applied using mass to measure humidity such as when the air was dry, the bar of charcoal would be light while the air was humid, the bar of charcoal would be heavy. By hanging <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> earth and a bar of charcoal on the two ends of a staff separately and adding a fixated lifting string on the middle point to make the staff horizontal in dry air, an ancient hygrometer was made.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{equations}} {{of general relativity}} are non-linear, <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which {{is determined by the}} Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.|$|E

Mr. Rogerson, a gardener and caretaker at Lakefield, lived {{in one of the}} cottages, and eventually his wife's two pedigree Pomeranians– Darkie and Duchess– would become the models for Potter's fictional Duchess. Darkie had a fine black mane, but Duchess was more intelligent and could sit up with <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> sugar balanced on her nose.|$|E

We characterise the entropy rate preservation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lumping</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aperiodic and irreducible Markov chain on a finite state space by the random growth rate of the cardinality of the realisable preimage of a finite-length trajectory <b>of</b> the <b>lumped</b> chain and by the information needed to reconstruct original trajectories from their lumped images. Both are purely combinatorial criteria, depending only on the transition graph of the Markov chain and the <b>lumping</b> function. <b>A</b> <b>lumping</b> is strongly k-lumpable, iff the <b>lumped</b> process is <b>a</b> k-th order Markov chain for each starting distribution of the original Markov chain. We characterise strong k-lumpability via tightness of stationary entropic bounds. In the sparse setting, we give sufficient conditions on the lumping to both preserve th...|$|R

5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
5|$|In Bengal, on {{the night}} of the sixth day after childbirth, a number of items may be placed in the lying-in chamber in {{deference}} to Shashthi, such as an earthen pitcher of water covered with a napkin, offerings of husked rice, cooked rice, bananas and sweets, bangles, and pieces of gold and silver. A pen and paper are also kept in the room, because it is believed that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on the paper with invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). <b>A</b> <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> cow dung dressed in red cloth or paper and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in room. Here, the new-born baby is oiled and dressed in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony. Childless people may perform a vrata (ritual) in worship of Shashthi, called either Chati Mata or Shashthi Vrata, in an effort to conceive.|$|E

25|$|From the 16th century, all pencils {{were made}} with leads of English natural graphite, but modern pencil lead is most {{commonly}} a mix of powdered graphite and clay; it was invented by Nicolas-Jacques Conté in 1795. It is chemically unrelated to the metal lead, whose ores had a similar appearance, hence {{the continuation of the}} name. Plumbago is another older term for natural graphite used for drawing, typically as <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> the mineral without a wood casing. The term plumbago drawing is normally restricted to 17th and 18th century works, mostly portraits.|$|E
25|$|The {{find was}} taken to the farm where Maggie (later Mrs Nicholl) washed the items in a sink. At that time they did not realise they were made from gold. The hoard was {{eventually}} sold to the British Museum for six hundred pounds. It consisted of a miniature ship, complete with fittings and oars; two necklets, a bowl and a torc (or hollow collar). The find was described as <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> mud when initially shown. Moreover, the boat had been so badly damaged by the plough that it took a goldsmith to later work out its structure.|$|E

25|$|A plastic {{print is}} a {{friction}} ridge impression {{left in a}} material that retains {{the shape of the}} ridge detail. Although very few criminals would be careless enough to leave their prints in <b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> wet clay, this would make a perfect plastic print. Commonly encountered examples are melted candle wax, putty removed from the perimeter of window panes and thick grease deposits on car parts. Such prints are already visible and need no enhancement, but investigators must not overlook the potential that invisible latent prints deposited by accomplices may also be on such surfaces. After photographically recording such prints, attempts should be made to develop other non-plastic impressions deposited from sweat or other contaminants.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said that the concept of {{treasure}} trove in English law dates back to the time of Edward the Confessor (c.1003/1004–1066). Under the common law, treasure trove was defined as gold or silver in any form, whether coin, plate (gold or silver vessels or utensils) or bullion (<b>a</b> <b>lump</b> <b>of</b> gold or silver),|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50029165|title=OED Online|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|accessdate=9 April 2008}}. which had been hidden and rediscovered, and which no person could prove he or she owned. If the person who had hidden the treasure was known or discovered later, it belonged to him or her or persons claiming through him or her such as descendants. To be treasure trove, an object had to be substantially – that is, more than 50% – gold or silver.|$|E
