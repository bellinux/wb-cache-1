5|$|SAH {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a head injury or spontaneously, usually from a {{ruptured}} cerebral aneurysm. Risk factors for spontaneous cases included high blood pressure, smoking, family history, alcoholism, <b>and</b> <b>cocaine</b> use.

After confirmation further tests are usually performed to determine the underlying cause.|$|E

He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, Piccadilly {{became known}} {{as a place to}} acquire heroin. Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Reece {{recalled}} people queuing outside Piccadilly's branch of Boots for heroin pills in the late 1940s. By the 1960s, the street and surrounding area were notorious as the centre of London's illegal drug trade, where heroin <b>and</b> <b>cocaine</b> could be purchased on the black market from unscrupulous chemists. By 1982, up to 20 people could be seen queueing at a chemist dealing in illegal drugs in nearby Shaftesbury Avenue.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted {{by the first}} manifestations of {{cerebral}} vascular disease and encephalopathy {{as a result of}} his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, diazepam, secobarbital, methaqualone, methylphenidate, Dexamyl, <b>and</b> <b>cocaine</b> (which he had used regularly since the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and antidepressant prescriptions.|$|E

5|$|The West Side Boys were unstable, {{possibly}} due to prolonged use of cannabis <b>and</b> <b>cocaine,</b> {{and their}} behaviour {{during the crisis}} was erratic.

The gang's drug habits also posed {{a problem for the}} British negotiators as the cannabis caused them to forget previous discussions and the cocaine made them distrustful.|$|E

In 2005, the band reunited with new vocalist William DuVall. On April 25, 2009, it was announced that Alice in Chains had signed to Virgin/EMI making it the band's first label change in their 20-plus year career. Black Gives Way to Blue, the group's first album with DuVall, was released on September 29, 2009.

5|$|In 1987, Sorkin {{started using}} {{marijuana}} <b>and</b> <b>cocaine.</b> He {{has said that}} in cocaine he found a drug that gave him relief from certain nervous tensions he deals with on a regular basis. In 1995, he checked into rehab at the Hazelden Institute in Minnesota, {{on the advice of}} his then girlfriend and soon to be wife Julia Bingham, to try to beat his addiction to cocaine. In 2001, Sorkin along with colleagues John Spencer and Martin Sheen received the Phoenix Rising Award for their personal victories over substance abuse. However, two months later on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when guards at a security checkpoint at the Burbank Airport found hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine in his carry-on bag when a metal crack pipe set off the gate's metal detector. He was ordered to a drug diversion program.|$|E

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} the deposition of <b>cocaine</b> into hair <b>and</b> {{the relationships between}} those concentrations, survey questionnaire results and natural killer cell activities were investigated. First, two and 18 month old mice were infected with LP-BM 5, injected with <b>cocaine,</b> <b>and</b> hair <b>cocaine</b> content measured. There {{was no difference in}} cocaine concentration between the age groups. Retrovirally infection mice had greater amounts of cocaine in their hair. Next, a group of mice were fed an ethanol diet <b>and</b> injected with <b>cocaine.</b> There was a decrease in cocaine recovered in the hair of the ethanol-fed mice. In a group of human drug users no correlation was found between survey questionnaire answers <b>and</b> hair <b>cocaine</b> concentrations. There was a correlation between natural killer cell activity <b>and</b> hair <b>cocaine</b> concentrations. It was concluded that hair analysis for cocaine may have a place in clinical settings, but a predictive correlation between drug intake and hair concentration may not be possible...|$|R

5|$|Prescribed 90 {{medications}} {{during the}} war years by his personal physician, Theodor Morell, Hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments. He regularly consumed amphetamine, barbiturates, opiates, <b>and</b> <b>cocaine,</b> as well as potassium bromide and atropa belladonna (the latter in the form of Doktor Koster's Antigaspills). He suffered ruptured eardrums {{as a result of the}} 20 July plot bomb blast in 1944, and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from his legs. Newsreel footage of Hitler shows tremors in his left hand and a shuffling walk, which began before the war and worsened towards the end of his life. Ernst-Günther Schenck and several other doctors who met Hitler in the last weeks of his life also formed a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|According to Crowley, Reuss {{had named}} him {{head of the}} O.T.O. upon his death, but this was {{challenged}} by {{a leader of the}} German O.T.O., Heinrich Tränker. Tränker called the Hohenleuben Conference in Thuringia, Germany, which Crowley attended. There, prominent members like Karl Germer and Martha Küntzel championed Crowley's leadership, but other key figures like Albin Grau, Oskar Hopfer, and Henri Birven backed Tränker by opposing it, resulting in a split in the O.T.O. Moving to Paris, where he broke with Olsen in 1926, Crowley went through a large number of lovers over the following years, with whom he experimented in sex magic. Throughout, he was dogged by poor health, largely caused by his heroin <b>and</b> <b>cocaine</b> addictions. In 1928, Crowley was introduced to young Englishman Israel Regardie, who embraced Thelema and became Crowley's secretary for the next three years. That year, Crowley also met Gerald Yorke, who began organising Crowley's finances but never became a Thelemite. He also befriended Thomas Driberg; Driberg did not accept Thelema either. It was here that Crowley also published one of his most significant works, Magick in Theory and Practice, which received little attention at the time.|$|E

50|$|Monoamine {{transporters}} {{are established}} targets for many pharmacological agents that affect brain function, including the psychostimulants <b>cocaine</b> <b>and</b> amphetamine. <b>Cocaine</b> <b>and</b> amphetamine employ different mechanisms that both {{result in an}} increase in extracellular monoamines by decreasing reuptake. Psychostimulants affect primarily DAT, although there is some inhibition at SERT and NET. Large increases in synaptic dopamine result in increased stimulation of target neurons believed to create the sensations of cocaine.|$|R
