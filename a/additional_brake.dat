40|$|Purpose. The {{research}} aims {{development of}} methods for calculating the estimated capacity humps {{for the loss}} conditions of brake power retarders. Methodology. The operation of humps is connected with large number of random factors, such as the characteristics of cuts, environmental conditions, the value of braking power implemented by retardants and others. In this regard, to research the set tasks the methods of simulation modeling and mathematical statistics are used. Determination of speed and motion time of cuts on the routes is carried out {{on the basis of}} rolling down modeling of their rolling down from the humps. Findings. If the brake power of retarders of the rolling down part of humps is not enough to stop the cuts, it should be provided the intervals during break-up to release the rolling routes from the preliminary cuts. The dependencies allowing to set the duration of these intervals were determined using the methods of the probability theory If the brake power of retarders at the rolling down part of humps and at the classification tracks is not enough to meet the requirements of the aimed regulation of the cuts rolling speed, it is necessary the use the <b>additional</b> <b>brake</b> shoes. The work develops the methods that on the basis of simulation modeling of the humping process allow one to set the desired value of the break-up duration increase.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of the phenomenon of “laterality” in a wide spectrum of parameters of the physical condition of the lower limbs in tennis, as well as to study the influence of 3 different methods on the same parameters, through examining variations in performance. The sample consisted of 64 sport science students at Serres, aged between 21. 05 ± 1. 33. Data were collected by means of laboratory measurements in the Department’s Laboratory of Biomechanics. Initially, their dominant and non-dominant side was examined and ascertained during lateral movement with side steps. Based on a specific measurement protocol which included: a) jumping attempts, b) races, c) strength tests, d) reaction to a visual stimulus and e) a speed check of cycle ergometer, the performance of both sides was registered when they were brought into action either one at time or both simultaneously. Following recommendations by Baumann, a single axis dynamometer (AMD Co. Ltd., typ LC 4204 -K 600, 1 -D, Load cell) was used to assess all the vertical jumps, performances in body side displacements and in reaction speed to optical stimulus. The dynamometer was placed in parallel with the ground on which there was a special steel platform. To assess the maximal isometric strength of the lower limbs (Fmaxiso), a second identical dynamometer was used, placed vertically on the ground, on a special closed device to facilitate its transfer. To assess the maximal speed on a cycle-ergometer (UEmax), a MONARK Ergomedic cycle-ergometer (814 E, classe A, din 32932) was used without an <b>additional</b> <b>brake</b> resistance. The speed at the distance of 11. 885 m. was measured (a) using two photocell fences consisted of two bands with two pairs of photocells each, and (b) with an automatic digital timer with minimal time measurement set to 0. 01 sec. Then, the subjects were divided into 4 subgroups (3 experimental groups and one control group). The training protocols that were applied to improve the non-dominant side, included jumping exercises for group A, tennis-specific racing exercises for group B, and an equal combination (50 % - 50 %) of the two previous types of exercise for group C. The volume of the training load during each training session comprised of 4 exercises from a program of six exercises in total, that were executed in various combinations across training sessions. Each exercise was repeated between 6 and 8 times in two sets in each training session. There was an interval of two minutes between sets. There was also a time break of 3 to 4 minutes between each type of exercise. To examine the influence of the various training methods the tests used were the Paired t-test, and the one-way ANOVA followed by the Scheffee post-hoc test. It was concluded, that the training of group A was as a whole more efficient in dealing with laterality, followed by group C, and then by group B. The non-dominant limb performances were improved as follows: The time of the body side displacement at 4. 115 m. and the sprint time at 11. 885 m. were decreased. Also, the height of the vertical jump and the speed at the cycle ergometer test were increased. Finally, the reaction time at the optical stimulus was decreased while the maximal isometric strength was increased. The practical application of the research results would be particularly useful in diagnosing laterality and would mainly contribute to the improvement speed and strength of lower limbs in tennis. ...|$|E
40|$|Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) has {{successfully}} completed a 10 year DOE sponsored heavy-duty truck engine program, hereafter {{referred to as}} the NZ- 50 program. This program was split into two major phases. The first phase was called âNear-Zero Emission at 50 Percent Thermal Efficiency,â and was completed in 2007. The second phase was initiated in 2006, and this phase was named âAdvancements in Engine Combustion Systems to Enable High-Efficiency Clean Combustion for Heavy-Duty Engines. â This phase was completed in September, 2010. The key objectives of the NZ- 50 program for this first phase were to: â¢ Quantify thermal efficiency degradation associated with reduction of engine-out NOx emissions to the 2007 regulated level of ~ 1. 1 g/hp-hr. â¢ Implement an integrated analytical/experimental development plan for improving subsystem and component capabilities in support of emerging engine technologies for emissions and thermal efficiency goals of the program. â¢ Test prototype subsystem hardware featuring technology enhancements and demonstrate effective application on a multi-cylinder, production feasible heavy-duty engine test-bed. â¢ Optimize subsystem components and engine controls (calibration) to demonstrate thermal efficiency that is in compliance with the DOE 2005 Joule milestone, meaning greater than 45 % thermal efficiency at 2007 emission levels. â¢ Develop technology roadmap for meeting emission regulations of 2010 and beyond while mitigating the associated degradation in engine fuel consumption. Ultimately, develop technical prime-path for meeting the overall goal of the NZ- 50 program, i. e., 50 % thermal efficiency at 2010 regulated emissions. These objectives were successfully met {{during the course of the}} NZ- 50 program. The most noteworthy achievements in this program are summarized as follows: â¢ Demonstrated technologies through advanced integrated experiments and analysis to achieve the technical objectives of the NZ- 50 program with 50. 2 % equivalent thermal efficiency under EPA 2010 emissions regulations. â¢ Experimentally demonstrate brake efficiency of 48. 5 % at EPA 2010 emission level at single steady-state point. â¢ Analytically demonstrated <b>additional</b> <b>brake</b> efficiency benefits using advanced aftertreatment configuration concept and air system enhancement including, but not limited to, turbo-compound, variable valve actuator system, and new cylinder head redesign, thus helping to achieve the final program goals. â¢ Experimentally demonstrated EPA 2010 emissions over FTP cycles using advanced integrated engine and aftertreatment system. These aggressive thermal efficiency and emissions results were achieved by applying a robust systems technology development methodology. It used integrated analytical and experimental tools for subsystem component optimization encompassing advanced fuel injection system, increased EGR cooling capacity, combustion process optimization, and advanced aftertreatment technologies. Model based controls employing multiple input and output techniques enabled efficient integration of the various subsystems and ensured optimal performance of each system within the total engine package.. The key objective of the NZ- 50 program for the second phase was to explore advancements in engine combustion systems using high-efficiency clean combustion (HECC) techniques to minimize cylinder-out emissions, targeting a 10 % efficiency improvement. The most noteworthy achievements in this phase of the program are summarized as follows: â¢ Experimentally and analytically evaluated numerous air system improvements related to the turbocharger and variable valve actuation. Some of the items tested proved to be very successful and modifications to the turbine discovered in this program have since been incorporated into production hardware. â¢ The combustion system development continued with evaluation of various designs of the 2 -step piston bowl. Significant improvements in engine emissions have been obtained, but fuel economy improvements have been tougher to realize. â¢ Development of a neural network control system progressed to the point that the system was fully functional and showing significant fuel economy gains in transient engine testing. â¢ Development of the QuantLogic injector with the capability of both a hollow cone spray during early injection and conventional diesel injection at later injection timings was undertaken and proved to be problematic. This injector was designed to be a key component in a PCCI combustion system, but this innovative fuel injector required significantly more development effort than this programâs resources or timing would allow...|$|E
