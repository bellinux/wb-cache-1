5|$|Even {{though this}} {{campaign}} is overshadowed by other battles of the revolution, {{it was one of}} the most important. The Maniates stopped the Egyptians and Ibrahim Pasha who had not been defeated this decisively before. The women who defeated the Egyptians at Diros have been given the name of 'The Amazons of Diros'. This was the last invasion of Mani as Ibrahim abandoned <b>any</b> <b>ideas</b> of conquering it. On the April 26, 1827 the Turkish navy bombarded Oitylo with over 1,700 cannonballs hitting the town.|$|E
5|$|In January 1937, the Ordnance Committee {{recommended}} {{development of}} such a weapon; two PaK 36 guns were acquired for study. As the projected main user of the weapon, the Infantry Branch was chosen to oversee the work. They wanted a lightweight gun that could be moved around by the crew, so <b>any</b> <b>ideas</b> of using a larger caliber {{than that of the}} German gun were discarded. The 37mm was a popular caliber of anti-tank guns in the 1930s; other anti-tank guns of the same caliber included Swedish Bofors gun, Czechoslovakian vz. 34 and vz. 37, Japanese Type 94 and Type 1.|$|E
5|$|When {{recording}} was completed, Gridneff asked Boucher {{if he had}} <b>any</b> <b>ideas</b> for {{a further}} season of Star Cops. Boucher felt that were the series to continue {{he would like to}} extend the setting further out into the Solar System, visiting the Mars colonies and the Big Ring space colonies under construction. He intended to achieve this either by transferring one of the existing regular characters to the Mars colony or by introducing a new regular who would be based there. The second season was never developed beyond these few basic notions as it was clear to Boucher from an early stage that there was little prospect of the series being renewed. Following Star Cops, Boucher went on to work as script editor on the long-running ITV police drama The Bill before returning to freelance writing while Gridneff moved on to work on the BBC drama series The House of Eliott.|$|E

25|$|When Kastner was 22, {{his father}} died reading the Torah in the synagogue on the seventh day of Passover.

He went to law school, as she wished, then worked {{full-time}} for Új Kelet after graduating, at first working as a sports reporter, though he continued to write about politics. He also became an assistant to Dr. József Fischer, a lawyer, member of Parliament, president of the Jewish Community of Kolozsvár, and leading member of the National Jewish Party. Fischer admired Kastner's writing, and encouraged him to continue working for Új Kelet too.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of US {{involvement}} in World War II, blackouts on the U.S. eastern seaboard were not in effect, and commercial ships traveling the coastal waterways were not travelling under convoy. King's critics attribute the delay in implementing these measures to his Anglophobia, as the convoys and seaboard blackouts were British proposals, and King was supposedly loath to have his much-beloved U.S. Navy adopt <b>any</b> <b>ideas</b> from the Royal Navy. He also refused, until March 1942, the loan of British convoy escorts when the Americans had {{only a handful of}} suitable vessels. He was, however, aggressive in driving his destroyer captains to attack U-boats in defense of convoys and in planning counter-measures against German surface raiders, even before the formal declaration of war in December 1941.|$|E

500|$|... "Soft Light" [...] {{was written}} by Vince Gilligan and {{directed}} by James A. Contner. Gilligan was a fan of The X-Files, and after talking about the show to his agent, who was a relative of series creator Chris Carter, he arranged a meeting between Gilligan and Carter. During it, Gilligan praised the show, and Carter asked if the writer had <b>any</b> <b>ideas</b> for it, to Gilligan's surprise. His reply {{was that he had}} been observing his shadow and thought it would be [...] "creepy" [...] if it began moving independently. Gilligan wrote the episode as a freelancer; after the episode was finished, Carter asked him to join the staff.|$|E

[...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had <b>any</b> <b>ideas.</b> Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out.

500|$|In 1783 Brooks {{played a}} {{prominent}} role in events concerning army pay arrears and pensions that became known as the Newburgh Conspiracy. [...] He was one of three officers who delivered to the Continental Congress a letter drafted by discontented officers, and participated in hearings in which the army delegation outlined serious issues among the officers at Newburgh, New York. [...] He then carried letters back to the army headquarters, and took part in actions orchestrated by Washington supporters to put down <b>any</b> <b>ideas</b> of mutiny. [...] He was accused, apparently falsely, of informing Washington of the conspiracy (Washington was tipped off by Alexander Hamilton to anticipate unrest.) [...] Historian Richard Kohn writes that details are lacking of Brooks' actions and motivations in the critical days of the conspiracy in February and March 1783, but describes his role in the affair as [...] "crucial".|$|E
500|$|In 1986, {{the then}} Controller of BBC One, Michael Grade, {{unhappy with the}} current state of Doctor Who, wrote to Newman to enquire whether he had <b>any</b> <b>ideas</b> for {{reformatting}} the series, which was at the time struggling in the ratings. Newman wrote back to Grade on October 6 that year with a set of detailed proposals and a suggestion that he take direct control of the series as executive producer. Grade suggested that Newman meet the current Head of Drama, Jonathan Powell, for lunch to discuss the Canadian's ideas. Newman and Powell did not get on well, however, and nothing came of their meeting. He was also unsuccessful in an attempt to have his name added to the end credits of the show as its creator. Acting Head of Series & Serials Ken Riddington, to whom Newman's request had been referred, wrote to him that [...] "Heads of Department who originate programmes have to be satisfied with the other rewards that flow from doing so." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{writing process}} for Spook Country began for Gibson {{with a desire}} to write a novel, but without <b>any</b> <b>ideas</b> or themes that he wished to explore. The impetus for the story grew out of the author's visual {{impressions}} of Lower Manhattan in winter, from which the character of Tito emerged. Little of the material in his original pitch of the novel (posted online as part of an early promotional campaign by the book's publishers) survived in the final draft. The original proposal focused on [...] "Warchalker", an obscure Iraqi warblog which chronicles the story of a disappeared consignment of millions of Iraqi reconstruction money. The readers of the blog included a female networks theorist interested in locative technology, and a Manhattanite of mixed heritage who freelanced with his family for organized crime. The plot would have followed those readers' attempt to track a shipping container through Warchalker on behalf of an unnamed villain.|$|E

500|$|Gilbert Adair, {{writing in}} a review for Full Metal Jacket, commented that [...] "Kubrick's {{approach}} to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression". Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a [...] "visual filmmaker", he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique. Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the filming, finding it [...] "more profitable to avoid locking up <b>any</b> <b>ideas</b> about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals" [...] as he put it. Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "I {{think you have to}} view the entire problem of putting the story you want to tell up there on that light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it's only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story. And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing". Kubrick also said: [...] "I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. I like a slow start, the start that gets under the audience's skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don't have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools." ...|$|E
