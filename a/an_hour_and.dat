5|$|A {{particularly}} damning {{piece of}} evidence came from a bonnetmaker named Maria Durden who told the court that Webster had visited her {{a week before the}} murder and had said {{that she was going to}} Birmingham to sell some property, jewellery and a house that her aunt had left her. The jury interpreted this as a sign that Webster had premeditated the murder and convicted her after deliberating for about <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> a quarter.|$|E
5|$|Accessibility to Odense {{was greatly}} {{increased}} when the ferry service {{between the two}} main Danish islands, Zealand and Funen, {{was replaced by the}} Great Belt Bridge – opened in 1997 for rail traffic, 1998 for road traffic. When the bridge opened, it was the second longest suspension bridge in the world. Aarhus can be reached by train in 1 hour and 33 minutes while, thanks to the Great Belt Bridge, trains to Copenhagen can take as little as <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> a quarter.|$|E

5|$|Balcon {{disliked the}} film and his initial thought was to cut its running time down to <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> {{classify}} it as a second feature. He did not provide Mackendrick with another directoral role, but assigned him to second unit work. Another of Ealing's directors, Charles Crichton, added additional footage at Ealing Studios and re-edited the film; this version was the one released into cinemas.|$|E
5|$|Cyrus later {{explained}} that it usually took over <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> half to transition from Miley to Hannah and vice versa on the television series set, while on tour it took approximately two minutes.

5|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} {{close proximity to}} its neighbouring communities, a motorized pirogue trip to Carabane from Elinkine, the nearest village, takes about thirty minutes; the trip once took <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> a half by canoe. Carabane may also be accessed by a two- or three-hour boat trip from Ziguinchor. Travelling from Cap Skirring via Cachouane is also possible, but as a detailed map of the region would make clear, the channels of salt water are not easily navigated.|$|E

5|$|The program's {{scheduled}} broadcast {{time was}} 21:00, but the channel often delayed its broadcast {{by up to}} 40 minutes.

5|$|After <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> a half {{had gone}} (and twenty minutes {{had passed since}} the second attack) the Indonesians {{launched}} a third and final attack up the slope towards the base, which the British responded to with artillery and grenade fire. This defence was remarkably effective, and eventually the barrage of Indonesian rocket fire halted and the few remaining British soldiers rose from their hideouts and began to clear the perimeter. Soon afterwards, Gurkha soldiers and medical staff arrived at the base by helicopter, leaving the soldiers behind to secure the area and airlifting the wounded to a nearby hospital. By this point, however, Indonesian forces had withdrawn, effectively ending the battle.|$|E

5|$|After the {{announcement}} and {{release of the}} third generation iPad, the iPad 2, which continued to be available for purchase, received a hardware upgrade. The upgraded variant of the iPad 2 features a smaller version of the Apple A5 SoC, which is able to reduce battery consumption. Benchmark tests conducted by Anandtech concluded that the upgraded variant is able to last longer by at least <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> a half, depending on the task that is conducted on the device. The maximum temperature that the device heated up to was also less than original iPad 2, tests conducted by the same organisation revealed that the upgraded variant was able to operate at 1 degree lower when performing intensive tasks. Performance {{difference between the two}} variants, according to Anandtech is negligible.|$|E
