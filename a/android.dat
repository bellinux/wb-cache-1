25|$|The novel Do <b>Androids</b> Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick, tells {{a science}} fiction story about <b>Androids</b> and humans clashing in a futuristic world.

Throughout the novel, Dick portrays the idea that human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.|$|R

40|$|September 25, 2009 Abstract. Over {{the last}} decade, {{research}} has been conducted on the potential of <b>androids</b> to evoke uncanny sensations in humans (the so-called uncanny valley phenomenon) : Experiments focussing on robot appearance have shown that static images of <b>androids</b> can avoid uncanniness if they are designed to be aesthetically pleasing. However, the appeal of such <b>androids</b> may only be achieved at the expense of physical realism. Concerning robot movement and behaviour, experiments suggest that <b>androids</b> may not be accepted if their behaviour fails {{to live up to the}} level of human likeness purported by their appearance. Movements which are reminiscent of those of diseased human beings may elicit strong feelings of eeriness. Exposure to eerie images of <b>androids</b> elicits unconscious defence mechanism usually connected to thoughts of death. However, <b>androids</b> are not genuine reminders of death or mortality. The experiments we discussed seem to suggest that a closer examinatio...|$|R

5|$|In North America, <b>Android</b> 4.2.2 {{was only}} {{available}} as the pre-loaded software on Verizon Wireless' HTC One, since HTC considered 4.2 {{to be relatively}} minor on smartphones. Instead, North American models were to be upgraded directly to <b>Android</b> 4.3, which was scheduled for a release in late-September 2013. HTC had previously released the <b>Android</b> 4.3 upgrade for the Google Play edition in early August 2013. On 25 September 2013, HTC began rolling out the upgrade, starting with unlocked models. Alongside the internal changes introduced by <b>Android</b> 4.3, the update adds {{the ability to use}} custom soundtracks on Highlights videos, and also corrects the low-light camera issues introduced by the 4.2.2 upgrade.|$|E

The number of combinations of software version, processor speed and even user interfaces was significantly larger than that for the iOS version. Ultimately, the team settled on a minimum set of requirements, even though that left nearly 30 types of <b>Android</b> phones unable to run the game, including some newly released phones. It was released on October 15, 2010. One month after the initial release on <b>Android,</b> Rovio Mobile began designing a lite version of the game for these other devices.|$|E

25|$|<b>Androids</b> are {{a staple}} of science fiction. Isaac Asimov pioneered the fictionalization of the science of {{robotics}} and artificial intelligence, notably in his 1950s series I, Robot. One thing common to most fictional <b>androids</b> is that the real-life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human-like robots—such as the creation of strong artificial intelligence—are assumed to have been solved. Fictional <b>androids</b> are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans—moving, thinking and speaking as fluidly as them.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} models for testing {{artificial}} intelligence {{have been noted}} by philosophers as being relevant to the themes present in Scott's filmography. The test most commonly associated with artificial intelligence in his work is the Turing test, created by the English computer scientist Alan Turing. Turing's argument was {{that there is no}} significant difference between a human and an <b>android,</b> which would be apparent when a human would be unable to identify if the individual they are communicating with is a human or <b>android.</b> In Blade Runner, the method for identifying the physically identical replicants is by administering the fictional Voight-Kampff test, which detects disparities in emotional responses. Though a replicant would fail the Turing test, an <b>android</b> at the chronological marker of Alien, such as Ash, would likely perform exceedingly well. Additionally, the Chinese room, created by John Searle, has been postured as a test relevant to the androids of the Alien franchise. As the test determines if someone can identify what is Chinese lettering without knowing what it means, philosophers have drawn a parallel to Ash, who may uncannily emulate a human, though fail to understand {{what it means to be}} one. Kang described David's eventual introduction as another <b>android</b> character created by Scott as a synthesis between both Alien and Blade Runner, with the character being capable of passing the Turing test like Ash, yet also able to pass the Chinese room test like a replicant, implying that he would indeed be the first living <b>android</b> of the Alien franchise.|$|E
