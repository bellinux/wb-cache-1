The estimated field metabolic rate (FMR) of a hummingbird maintaining a constant body mass (mean 4. 48 g) is about 32 kl/day, which is 5. 2 times basal metabolic rate (BMR). Metabolic rates during daylight hours were about 6. 8 X BMR, less than one-half that expected for an Anna 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hummingbird</b> in continuous hovering flight. We estimated nighttime metabolism to be near 2. 1 X BMR, which is about what would be expected for a normothermic, resting bird experiencing cool air temperatures (as low as 15 C) but much higher than expected if torpor were employed. Water influx was about 164...|$|R
