5|$|On March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated posted {{an article}} on its website {{as part of its}} {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. The article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Orton, who was alleged to have obtained <b>anastrozole,</b> clomiphene citrate, nandrolone, oxandrolone, stanozolol, and testosterone. WWE simply claimed that the allegations preceded their Talent Wellness program launched in February 2006.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, 2007, Anderson gave an {{interview}} in which he admitted to using steroids when he was performing on the independent wrestling scene, stating that he had quit using them in November 2005 to comply with WWE's Talent Wellness Program, implying that his job in the promotion was worth more than extra muscle mass. 12 days later, on August 30, his statements were shown to be incorrect when he, along with nine other WWE wrestlers, were named in a Sports Illustrated article as having received performance-enhancing drugs in direct non-compliance with the WWE Talent Wellness Program. Anderson received <b>anastrozole,</b> somatropin, and testosterone between October 2006 and February 2007. He later claimed that the steroids were for a legitimate medical reason, {{saying that they were}} from when he tore his latissimus dorsi muscle in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Hormone therapies are a {{topic of}} current {{research}} in ovarian cancer, particularly, the value of certain medications used to treat breast cancer. These include tamoxifen, letrozole, and <b>anastrozole.</b> Preliminary studies have showed a benefit for tamoxifen in {{a small number of}} people with advanced ovarian cancer. Letrozole may help to slow or stop growth of estrogen receptor positive ovarian cancer. <b>Anastrozole</b> is being investigated in postmenopausal people with estrogen receptor-positive cancer.|$|E
25|$|Tamoxifen-treated {{breast cancer}} {{patients}} show evidence of reduced cognition, a major side effect of tamoxifen, and semantic memory scores. However memory impairment in patients treated with tamoxifen was less severe compared with those treated with <b>anastrozole</b> (an aromatase inhibitor).|$|E
25|$|Alderley Park {{opened in}} October 1957, and ICI Pharmaceuticals {{was formed in}} the same year. In 1962 Dora Richardson of ICI {{discovered}} tamoxifen. ICI Alderley Park later discovered <b>Anastrozole,</b> Fulvestrant, Goserelin and Bicalutamide, later made by Zeneca. Sir James Black discovered beta blockers—propranolol (Inderal) at Alderley Park in 1962. The Wellcome Foundation, a provider of much of Britain's medical research, was based from 1966-97 at Crewe Hall in Crewe Green.|$|E
500|$|There is also {{research}} in progress on more genes and biomarkers {{that may be}} linked to endometrial cancer. The protective effect of combined oral contraceptives and the IUD is being investigated. Preliminary research has shown that the levonorgestrel IUD placed for a year, combined with 6monthly injections of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, can stop or reverse the progress of endometrial cancer in young women. An experimental drug that combines a hormone with doxorubicin is also under investigation for greater efficacy in cancers with hormone receptors. [...] Hormone therapy that is effective in treating breast cancer, including use of aromatase inhibitors, is also being investigated for use in endometrial cancer. One such drug is <b>anastrozole,</b> which is currently being researched in hormone-positive recurrences after chemotherapy. Research into hormonal treatments for endometrial stromal sarcomas is ongoing as well. It includes trials of drugs like mifepristone, a progestin antagonist, and aminoglutethimide and letrozole, two aromatase inhibitors.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrazine is a {{precursor}} to several pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Often these applications involve conversion of hydrazine to heterocyclic rings such as pyrazoles and pyridazines. [...] Examples of commercialized bioactive hydrazine derivatives include cefazolin, rizatriptan, <b>anastrozole,</b> [...] fluconazole, metazachlor, metamitron, metribuzin, paclobutrazol, diclobutrazole, propiconazole,hydrazine sulfate, diimide and triadimefon.|$|E
2500|$|Antiestrogens (or {{so-called}} [...] "estrogen blockers") like aromatase inhibitors (AIs) (e.g., <b>anastrozole)</b> or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (e.g., tamoxifen) {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the effects of high levels of endogenous estrogen (e.g., breast development, feminine fat distribution) in transgender men. In addition, in those who have not yet undergone or completed epiphyseal closure (which occurs during adolescence and is mediated by estrogen), antiestrogens can prevent hip widening as well as increase final height (estrogen limits height by causing the epiphyses to fuse).|$|E
2500|$|Endocrine {{therapy for}} breast cancer {{involves}} selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS), such as tamoxifen, which behave as ER antagonists in breast tissue, or aromatase inhibitors, such as <b>anastrozole.</b> ER status is used to determine sensitivity of breast cancer lesions to tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. [...] Another SERM, raloxifene, {{has been used as}} a preventive chemotherapy for women judged to have a high risk of developing breast cancer. [...] Another chemotherapeutic anti-estrogen, ICI 182,780 (Faslodex), which acts as a complete antagonist, also promotes degradation of the estrogen receptor.|$|E
2500|$|Aromatase is {{an enzyme}} which {{converts}} some enones with a six membered ring to aromatic rings - specifically testosterone to estradiol and androstenedione to estrone. [...] Each of these aromatizations involves the oxidation of the C-19 methyl group to formic acid {{to allow for}} the formation of the aromatic system, conversions which are necessary parts of estrogen tumorogenesis in the development of breast cancer and ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women and gynecomastia in men. Aromatase inhibitors like exemestane (which forms a permanent and deactivating bond with the aromatase enzyme) and <b>anastrozole</b> and letrozole (which compete for the enzyme) {{have been shown to be}} more effective than anti-estrogen medications such as tamoxifen likely because they prevent the formation of estradiol.|$|E
2500|$|Some breast cancers require {{estrogen}} {{to continue}} growing. They {{can be identified}} {{by the presence of}} estrogen receptors (ER+) and progesterone receptors (PR+) on their surface (sometimes referred to together as hormone receptors). These ER+ cancers can be treated with drugs that either block the receptors, e.g. tamoxifen, or alternatively block the production of estrogen with an aromatase inhibitor, e.g. <b>anastrozole</b> or letrozole. The use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years. Letrozole is recommended for 5 years. [...] Aromatase inhibitors are only suitable for women after menopause; however, in this group, they appear better than tamoxifen. This is because the active aromatase in postmenopausal women is different from the prevalent form in premenopausal women, and therefore these agents are ineffective in inhibiting the predominant aromatase of premenopausal women. Aromatase inhibitors should not be given to premenopausal women with intact ovarian function (unless they are also on treatment to stop their ovaries from working).|$|E
2500|$|Toxicology reports {{released}} on July 17, 2007, revealed that at their time of death, Nancy had three different drugs in her system: Xanax, hydrocodone, and hydromorphone, {{all of which}} were found at the therapeutic rather than toxic levels. Daniel was found to have Xanax in his system, which led the chief medical examiner to believe that he was sedated before he was murdered. Benoit was found to have Xanax, hydrocodone, and an elevated level of testosterone, caused by a synthetic form of the hormone, in his system. The chief medical examiner attributed the testosterone level to Benoit possibly being treated for a deficiency caused by previous steroid abuse or testicular insufficiency. There was no indication that anything in Benoit's body contributed to his violent behaviour that led to the murder–suicide, concluding that there was no [...] "roid-rage" [...] involved. Prior to the murder–suicide, Benoit had been given illegal steroids not in compliance with WWE's Talent Wellness Program in February 2006. Benoit received nandrolone and <b>anastrozole.</b> During the investigation into steroid abuse, it was revealed that other wrestlers had also been given steroids.|$|E
50|$|Bone {{weakness}} {{has been}} associated with <b>anastrozole.</b> Women who switched to <b>anastrozole</b> after two years on tamoxifen reported twice as many fractures as those who continued to take tamoxifen (2.1% compared to 1%). Bisphosphonates are sometimes prescribed to prevent the osteoporosis induced by aromatase inhibitors. The level of circulating estradiol is likely causal here and not the <b>anastrozole</b> itself, and so the dose will determine likelihood of osteoporosis (estradiol inhibits osteoclasts, which resorb bone). Acne, constricted pupils and water retention have also been attributed with use of this anti-estrogen.|$|E

5000|$|Aromatase inhibitors: <b>anastrozole,</b> aminoglutethimide, fadrozole, finrozole, letrozole, liarozole, norendoxifen, {{rogletimide}} (pyridoglutethimide), vorozole ...|$|E
5000|$|The ATAC {{trial was}} of {{localized}} {{breast cancer and}} women received either <b>anastrozole,</b> tamoxifen, or both for five years, followed by five years of follow-up. [...] After more than 5 years the group that received <b>anastrozole</b> had better results than the tamoxifen group. The trial suggested that <b>anastrozole</b> is the preferred medical therapy for postmenopausal women with localized breast cancer, which is estrogen receptor (ER) positive. Another {{study found that the}} risk of recurrence was reduced by 40%, but was associated with an increased risk of bone fractures. The study concluded that ER positive patients benefited from switching from tamoxifen to <b>anastrozole</b> in patients who have completed 2 years' adjuvant tamoxifen. A more recent trial found that <b>anastrozole</b> significantly reduced the incidence of breast cancer in postmenopausal women relative to placebo, and while there were side effects related to estrogen deprivation observed, the researchers concluded that this was probably not related to the treatment. Lead author Jack Cuzick was quoted by the BBC as saying, [...] "This class of drugs is more effective than previous drugs such as tamoxifen and crucially, it has fewer side effects," [...] adding that he thought there was now enough evidence to support offering the drug.|$|E

50|$|<b>Anastrozole</b> was {{patented}} in 1987 {{and approved}} {{for medical use}} in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Anastrozole</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 1.92 to 30.60 USD a month. In the United States the wholesale cost is about 3.81 USD per month.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anastrozole</b> {{is poorly}} able {{to cross the}} blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system. This is due to P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux.|$|E
5000|$|Nonsteroidal inhibitors, such as <b>anastrozole</b> (Arimidex) and {{letrozole}} (Femara), {{inhibit the}} synthesis of estrogen via reversible competition for the aromatase enzyme.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anastrozole</b> {{reversibly}} binds to the aromatase enzyme, {{and through}} competitive inhibition blocks {{the conversion of}} androgens to estrogens in peripheral (extragonadal) tissues.|$|E
50|$|Type II {{aromatase}} inhibitors such as <b>anastrozole</b> and letrozole, by contrast, are not {{steroids and}} work by {{interfering with the}} aromatase's heme.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anastrozole</b> {{has been}} tested for {{reducing}} estrogens, including estradiol, in men. Excess estradiol in men can cause benign prostatic hyperplasia, gynecomastia, and symptoms of hypogonadism. It can also contribute to increased risk of stroke, heart attack, chronic inflammation, prostate enlargement and prostate cancer. Some athletes and body builders use <b>anastrozole</b> {{as part of their}} steroid cycle to reduce and prevent symptoms of excess estrogen--gynecomastia, emotional lability and water retention. Study data suggest dosages of 0.5 mg to 1 mg a day reduce serum estradiol by approximately 50% in men, which differs in postmenopausal women.|$|E
5000|$|Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as aminoglutethimide, <b>anastrozole,</b> exemestane, letrozole, and {{testolactone}} {{inhibit the}} production of estrogens from androgens and are used mainly {{in the treatment of}} estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|Potential {{methods in}} unexplained {{infertility}} include oral ovarian stimulation agents (such as clomifene citrate, <b>anastrozole</b> or letrozole) {{as well as}} intrauterine insemination (IUI), intracervical insemination (ICI) and in vitro fertilization (IVF).|$|E
50|$|<b>Anastrozole,</b> {{brand name}} Arimidex, {{is a type}} of anti-estrogen used in {{treatment}} of breast cancer but is also used by bodybuilders to combat the estrogenic side effects associated with using anabolic steroids.|$|E
5000|$|The MONARCH 3 {{study is}} {{investigating}} the effectiveness of Abemaciclib, plus either <b>anastrozole</b> or letrozole, as a first-line treatment for women with breast cancer. The trail is expected to end in June 2017.|$|E
50|$|In a {{clinical}} study of enzalutamide for -positive {{breast cancer in}} women, enzalutamide was found to decrease serum concentrations of the aromatase inhibitors <b>anastrozole</b> and exemestane by 90% and 50%, respectively, which could reduce their effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|Antiestrogens include {{selective}} estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like tamoxifen, clomifene, and raloxifene, the ER silent antagonist {{and selective}} estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) fulvestrant, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) like <b>anastrozole,</b> and antigonadotropins including androgens/anabolic steroids, progestogens, and GnRH analogues.|$|E
50|$|Tamoxifen-treated {{breast cancer}} {{patients}} show evidence of reduced cognition, a major side effect of tamoxifen, and semantic memory scores. However memory impairment in patients treated with tamoxifen was less severe compared with those treated with <b>anastrozole</b> (an aromatase inhibitor).|$|E
50|$|Estrogen {{deprivation}} {{therapy is}} a form of hormone therapy that is used in the treatment of breast cancer. Modalities include antiestrogens such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like tamoxifen, selective estrogen receptor degraders like fulvestrant, and aromatase inhibitors like <b>anastrozole</b> and ovariectomy.|$|E

50|$|Common {{side effects}} include hot flashes, altered mood, joint pain, and nausea. Severe side effects include an {{increased}} risk of heart disease and osteoporosis. Use during pregnancy is known to harm the baby. <b>Anastrozole</b> is in the aromatase-inhibiting family of medications. It works by blocking the creation of estrogen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anastrozole,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Arimidex among others, is a {{medication}} used {{in addition to}} other treatments for breast cancer. Specifically it is used for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. It has also been used to prevent breast cancer in those at high risk. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|Metandienone binds to and {{activates}} the {{androgen receptor}} (AR) {{in order to}} exert its effects. These include dramatic increases in protein synthesis, glycogenolysis, and muscle strength over a short space of time. Side effects such as gynecomastia, high blood pressure, acne and male pattern baldness may begin to occur. The drug causes severe masculinizing effects in women even at low doses. In addition, it is metabolized into methylestradiol by aromatase. This means that without the administration of aromatase inhibitors such as <b>anastrozole</b> or aminoglutethimide, estrogenic effects like gynecomastia (breast development) may appear over time in men. Many users combat the estrogenic side effects with <b>anastrozole,</b> tamoxifen or clomifene. In addition, as with other 17α-alkylated steroids, the use of metandienone over {{extended periods of time}} can result in liver damage without appropriate precautions.|$|E
