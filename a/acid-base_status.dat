40|$|Altitude {{exposure}} {{is associated with}} major changes in cardiovascular function. The initial cardiovascular response to altitude is characterized {{by an increase in}} cardiac output with tachycardia, no change in stroke volume, whereas blood pressure may temporarily be slightly increased. After a few days of acclimatization, cardiac output returns to normal, but heart rate remains increased, so that stroke volume is decreased. Pulmonary artery pressure increases without change in pulmonary artery wedge pressure. This pattern is essentially unchanged with prolonged or lifelong altitude sojourns. Ventricular function is maintained, with initially increased, then preserved or slightly depressed indices of systolic function, and an altered diastolic filling pattern. Filling pressures of the heart remain unchanged. Exercise in acute as well as in chronic high-altitude {{exposure is}} associated with a brisk increase in pulmonary artery pressure. The relationships between workload, cardiac output, and oxygen uptake are preserved in all circumstances, but there is a decrease in maximal oxygen consumption, which is accompanied by a decrease in maximal cardiac output. The decrease in maximal cardiac output is minimal in acute hypoxia but becomes more pronounced with acclimatization. This is not explained by hypovolemia, <b>acid-bases</b> <b>status,</b> increased viscosity on polycythemia, autonomic nervous system changes, or depressed systolic function. Maximal oxygen uptake at high altitudes has been modeled to be determined by the matching of convective and diffusional oxygen transport systems at a lower maximal cardiac output. However, there has been recent suggestion that 10 % to 25 % of the loss in aerobic exercise capacity at high altitudes can be restored by specific pulmonary vasodilating interventions. Whether this is explained by an improved maximum flow output by an unloaded right ventricle remains to be confirmed. Altitude exposure carries no identified risk of myocardial ischemia in healthy subjects but has to be considered as a potential stress in patients with previous cardiovascular conditions.

Following 5 min of exhaustive exercise, white muscle lactate concentration was approximately doubled (approximately 32 �mol g � 1) in larger fish than in smaller fish (approximately 16 �mol g � 1). Associated with this post-exercise increase in lactate was a nearly parallel {{increase in the number}} of metabolic protons produced by larger fish. Larger fish did not possess a greater non-bicarbonate buffering capacity or soluble protein concentration, so their mean muscle intracellular pH (pHi) decreased by approximately 0. 70 units compared with a change in mean pHi of about 0. 40 units in the smallest fish. The relationship between resting pHi and length was independent of size (mean pHi 7. 31). Concentrations of muscle energy metabolites were also determined in trout white muscle before and after exercise. Under resting conditions, larger fish possessed a twofold greater concentration of ATP (approximately 7 �mol g � 1) than did smaller fish (approximately 3 �mol g � 1). Similarly, resting values of muscle glycogen range from about 6 �mol g � 1 in the smallest fish to as high as 15 �mol g � 1 in the largest fish. However, the smaller fish had higher levels (approximately 35 �mol g � 1) of phosphocreatine (PCr) than the larger fish (approximately 25 �mol g � 1). Following exercise, however, both ATP and glycogen concentrations remained size-dependent and increased with increases in fish length. Levels of PCr were size-independent following exercise. These results demonstrate that body size has an important influence on the <b>acid–base</b> and metabolic <b>status</b> of fish before and after exercise...|$|R

40|$|Changes in oxygen consumption, ammonia {{excretion}} {{and in the}} <b>acid-base</b> {{and energy}} <b>status</b> of various tissues were investigated in the cold stenothermal Antarctic bivalve, Limopsis marionensis, and compared to similar data in the limpet, Nacella concinna, for an assessment of thermal sensitivity. Oxygen consumption of L. marionensis varied between − 1. 5 and 2 °C with a Q 10 of 2. 2. Ammonia excretion could only be detected in animals exposed to elevated temperature for periods in excess of 45 [*]days and close to death and it is interpreted as the onset of protein and amino acid catabolism with starvation under temperature stress. In L. marionensis any change in temperature as well as starvation stress at constant temperature induced a decrease in phospho-l-arginine and ATP levels. However, only temperature stress resulted in {{a drop in the}} Gibb's free energy change of ATP hydrolysis. Intracellular pH rose in all tissues during upward or downward temperature changes of only 1. 5 or 2 °C for 24 [*]h with a concomitant trend to accumulate succinate and acetate in the tissues. These changes are seen to reflect disturbances of the tissue <b>acid-base</b> and energy <b>status</b> with any under- or overshoot in aerobic metabolic rate during a temperature decrease or increase. Elevated temperature at 2 °C during 2 [*]weeks of incubation resulted in continued net ATP depletion, at low levels of ATP free energy. This indicates long-term stress, which was also mirrored in the inability to establish a new steady-state mean rate of oxygen consumption. Incubation at even higher temperatures of 4 and 7 °C led to an aggravation of energetic stress and transition to an intracellular acidosis, as well as a fall in oxygen consumption. In N. concinna a drop in energy levels was also visible at 2 °C but was compensated for during long-term incubation. In conclusion, L. marionensis will be able to compensate for a temperature change only in a very narrow range whereas the thermal tolerance window is much wider in N. concinna. The inability of the metabolic rate to rise continually and the concomitant transition to anaerobic metabolism and long-term energetic stress characterize the upper critical temperature. Stenothermality is discussed, not only as reflecting the permanent and very stable low temperature in the natural environment, but also regarding differences in the level of activity and aerobic scope...|$|R

Blood PO 2, PCO 2, and pH, as well as plasma concentrations of lactate, glucose, Na+, K+, Cl-, total Ca, and total Mg were determined in venous blood collected from the occipital sinus.

However, {{there is evidence}} that this response may be sigmoidal in nature. Moreover, it was speculated that these changes at high altitude are mediated by alterations in acid-base buffering. Accordingly, we reanalyzed previously published data to assess middle cerebral blood flow velocity (MCAv) responses to modified rebreathing at sea level (SL), upon ascent (ALT 1) and following 16 days of acclimatization (ALT 16) to 5, 260 m in 21 lowlanders. Using sigmoid curve fitting of the MCAv responses to CO 2, we found the amplitude (95 % vs. 129 %, SL vs. ALT 1, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) [77, 112], [111, 145], respectively, P= 0. 024) and the slope of the sigmoid response (4. 5 vs. 7. 5 %/mmHg, SL vs. ALT 1, 95 % CIs [3. 1, 5. 9], [6. 0, 9. 0], respectively, P= 0. 026) to be enhanced at ALT 1, which persisted with acclimatization at ALT 16 (amplitude: 177 %, 95 % CI [139, 215], P< 0. 001; slope: 10. 3 %/mmHg, 95 % CI [8. 2, 12. 5], P= 0. 003) compared to SL. Meanwhile, the sigmoidal response midpoint was unchanged at ALT 1 (SL: 36. 5 mmHg; ALT 1 : 35. 4 mmHg, 95 % CIs [34. 0, 39. 0], [33. 1, 37. 7], respectively, P= 0. 982), while it was reduced by ~ 7 mmHg at ALT 16 (28. 6 mmHg, 95 % CI [26. 4, 30. 8], P= 0. 001 vs. SL), indicating leftward shift of the cerebrovascular CO 2 response to a lower arterial partial pressure of CO 2 (PaCO 2) following acclimatization to altitude. Sigmoid fitting revealed a leftward shift in the midpoint of the cerebrovascular response curve which could not be observed with linear fitting. These findings demonstrate that there is resetting of the cerebrovascular CO 2 reactivity operating point to a lower PaCO 2 following acclimatization to high altitude.

Non-bicarbonate, non-phosphate buffer values estimated by the homogenate technique were similar in the three studied species (28 - 37 mmol pH- 1 kg- 1 wet weight) and did not change during freshwater exposure. The CaCO 3 buffer value of the foot tissues was considerably higher (171 - 218 mmol pH- 1 kg- 1 wet weight) and decreased significantly during freshwater exposure. The contribution of the multiple tissue buffering systems to pHi regulation in Littorina spp. shifts between different stages of freshwater exposure. Initially the non-bicarbonate, non-phosphate tissue buffering system seems to be of major importance for metabolic proton buffering at pHi between 7. 5 and 7. 0. During later stages of anaerobiosis and at lower pHi, the CaCO 3 buffer is involved in proton buffering. Decrease in the CaCO 3 buffer value during freshwater exposure was in quantitative agreement with the amount of metabolic protons buffered thus suggesting that CaCO 3 tissue stores may serve as a major buffering system during prolonged anaerobiosis in Littorina spp...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that pendrin, an apical Cl(-) /HCO 3 (-) {{exchanger}} in type B intercalated cells, is modulated by chronic acid-base disturbances and electrolyte intake. To study this adaptation further at the acute level, we analyzed urinary exosomes from individuals subjected to oral acute acid, alkali, and NaCl loading. Acute oral NH 4 Cl loading (n =  8) elicited systemic acidemia with a drop in urinary pH and an increase in urinary NH 4 excretion. Nadir urinary pH was achieved 5  h after NH 4 Cl loading. Exosomal pendrin abundance was dramatically decreased at 3  h after acid loading. In contrast, after acute equimolar oral NaHCO 3 loading (n =  8), urinary and venous blood pH rose rapidly with a significant attenuation of urinary NH 4 excretion. Alkali loading caused rapid upregulation of exosomal pendrin abundance at 1  h and normalized within 3  h of treatment. Equimolar NaCl loading (n =  6) did not alter urinary or venous blood pH or urinary NH 4 excretion. However, pendrin abundance in urinary exosomes was significantly reduced at 2  h of NaCl ingestion with lowest levels observed at 4  h after treatment. In patients with inherited distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), pendrin abundance in urinary exosomes was greatly reduced and did not change upon oral NH 4 Cl loading. In summary, pendrin can be detected and quantified in human urinary exosomes by immunoblotting. Acid, alkali, and NaCl loadings cause acute changes in pendrin abundance in urinary exosomes within a few hours. Our data suggest that exosomal pendrin is a promising urinary biomarker for acute <b>acid-base</b> and volume <b>status</b> changes in humans...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to selectively cool the brain with cold saline circulating in balloon catheters introduced into the nasal cavity in pigs. Material and methods: Twelve anaesthetised pigs were subjected to selective cerebral cooling for a period of 6 h. Cerebral temperature was towered by means of bilaterally introduced nasal balloon catheters perfused with saline cooled by a heat exchanger to 8 - 10 degrees C. Brain temperature was measured in both cerebral hemispheres. Body temperature was measured in rectum, oesophagus and the right atrium. The pigs were normoventilated and haemodynamic variables were measured continuously. <b>Acid-base</b> and electrolyte <b>status</b> was measured hourly. Results: Cerebral hypothermia was induced rapidly and within the first 20 min of cooling cerebral temperature was lowered from 38. 1 +/- 0. 6 degrees C by a mean of 2. 8 +/- 0. 6 to 35. 3 +/- 0. 6 degrees C.

Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAG acidosis) has also been reported in acute asthma but {{its impact on the}} clinical outcome has not been evaluated. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the prevalence of NAG acidosis, characterize the laboratory findings, and determine its impact on clinical outcomes. <b>Acid-base</b> and electrolyte <b>status</b> and clinical outcomes were examined over a 1 -yr (2005 calendar yr) period in 109 adult patients (38 males, 71 females; age range 21 to 91 yr) hospitalized for asthma exacerbation. The cohort was divided into 3 groups: I. No metabolic acidosis (n = 66), II. Anion gap (AG) acidosis (n = 11), and III. NAG acidosis (n = 32). For each of the groups, laboratory findings were consistent, demonstrating a tendency to hyperchloremia in the NAG acidosis group. One subject in the NAG acidosis group died. NAG acidosis was associated with a statistically significant (p = 0. 028) risk of requirement for mechanical ventilation necessitating admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU); the odds ratio for intubation for NAG acidosis compared to other groups was 3. 92. No difference, however, was detected in overall length of stay (LOS) in hospital for patients with NAG acidosis vs the other groups. NAG metabolic acidosis in acute asthma may be more prevalent than expected and may be associated with more frequent need for mechanical ventilation and admission to an intensive care unit...|$|R
