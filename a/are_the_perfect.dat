500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed critical reception. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded it a C, {{claiming that}} Amy [...] "gets {{some of the}} episode's best lines". Sava noted that it [...] "has a lot of Jew humor, and Mayim Bialik and Simon Helberg <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> people to deliver it", although disliked Barry and Wil and said that [...] "their jokes wore thin fairly quickly". R.L. Shaffer of IGN also gave the episode a mixed review, saying that The Big Bang Theory has become more [...] "cynical and chauvinistic" [...] towards female characters. Shaffer also noted he was more frustrated about [...] "the revelation that Bernadette wouldn't allow strippers at Wolowitz's bachelor party", as it is never explained why. Shaffer claimed that there were [...] "only a few laughs here and there" [...] and scored the episode 5.5 out of 10, classifying it as [...] "mediocre".|$|E

Michael Paoletta of Billboard stated, [...] "the retro-vibed song {{calls to mind}} the sparkly yet wistful soul of '60s-era girl groups" [...] while maintaining [...] "a contemporary reference". Paoletta considered its aura and [...] "girl-desires-boy theme" [...] to make the track a [...] "crossover gem". West's production was also praised, adding [...] "the opening drum downbeat immediately sets the tone. That beat smoothly propels the song, accompanied by swirling string crescendos that <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> backdrop for Jackson's breathy vocals", concluding it to potentially have [...] "multiformat popularity." [...] Ernest Hardy of LA Weekly called it [...] "a retro affair" [...] with a classic [...] "girl-group arrangement", while a critique from Gashaus noted the song [...] "shimmers with some of Janet's former iridescent glow."

500|$|Victor and Nikki are {{recognized}} as one of daytime television's most prominent couples. They have also garnered a large fan following, dubbed [...] "Niktor" [...] by viewers. In addition, the couple's weddings have been reported by mainstream media. Scott has said: [...] "Let’s face facts: [...] Victor and Nikki will always be a huge dynamic, they’ve been in a circular cycle for over 30 years! [...] Finding a new leading man that you have chemistry with is like finding gold." [...] In a 1994 interview with The Los Angeles Times, the newspaper reported that Victor's relationship with Nikki had [...] "registered an enduring appeal among viewers", with Braeden replying that, [...] "Arguably, it's the idea of this incredibly powerful, wealthy man taking a woman who comes from {{the wrong side of the}} tracks into his life, and shaping her and forming her more to his liking. But, of course, no one can shape or form anyone, she remains who she is, has retained her strength, and that causes conflict." [...] In other interviews, Braeden stated that he loves working with Scott and that he [...] "always thought it was an honestly felt love story with great material for conflict with Nikki". He also stated in an interview that he considers Victor's storylines with Nikki to be some of his favorites. Discussing Victor and Nikki's union, former As the World Turns actress Martha Byrne stated: [...] "Young and Restless Victor and Nikki <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> example of a couple who they can tear apart and put back together how many times? And [...] do it really well because they're so stable as characters that you can basically do anything with them now, and the audience will go on the journey with them." [...] The Museum of Television and Radio wrote: [...] "Combined with a series of social-issue storylines covering everything from AIDS to date rape to the plight of the elderly, as well as featuring a group of popular young African-American characters, and several long-term romantic and professional relationships, Victor and Nikki's love story has kept viewers enthralled for many years." [...] They also described their relationship as being a [...] "dominant force" [...] in the soap opera. Daytime journalist Michael Fairman stated: [...] "Victor and Nikki just can’t, we mean can’t, ever get it together long enough to find any happiness with each other. So, many would say that they deserve each other and the baggage and betrayals that come along with their co-dependent relationship." ...|$|E

C., for instance, does not appear in Mr. Robertson's volume, nor the Young Love of the same author, nor the beautiful elegy Ben Jonson wrote on the death of Salathiel Pavy, the little boy-actor of his plays.

6000|$|But Christmas is {{not only}} the mile-mark of another year, moving us to {{thoughts}} of self-examination: it is a season, from all its associations, whether domestic or religious, suggesting thoughts of joy. A man dissatisfied with his endeavours is a man tempted to sadness. And {{in the midst of the}} winter, when his life runs lowest and he is reminded of the empty chairs of his beloved, it is well he should be condemned to this fashion of the smiling face. Noble disappointment, noble self-denial are not to be admired, not even to be pardoned, if they bring bitterness. It is one thing to enter the kingdom of heaven maim; another to maim yourself and stay without. And the kingdom of heaven is of the childlike, of those who are easy to please, who love and who give pleasure. Mighty men of their hands, the smiters and the builders and the judges, have lived long and done sternly and yet preserved this lovely character; and among our carpet interests and twopenny concerns, the shame were indelible if we should lose it. Gentleness and cheerfulness, these come before all morality; they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> duties. And it is the trouble with moral men that they have neither one nor other. It was the moral man, the Pharisee, whom Christ could not away with. If your morals make you dreary, depend upon it they are wrong.

In spite of the vast varieties of language and dialect spoken by fifty or sixty human beings, collected from twenty or thirty islets of the Pacific main, no practical difficulty {{has been found in}} using the Mota as the general language in Chapel and school, so that in a short time a congregation of twenty languages are able to join in worship in the one Mota tongue, more or less akin to all the rest, and a class of, say, nine boys, speaking by nature five different languages, easily join in using the one Mota language, just as a Frenchman, a German, a Russian, a Pole, an Italian, and an Englishman, all meeting in the same cafe or railway carriage, on the same glacier or mountain top, might harmoniously agree to use the French language as their medium of communication. So the service is conducted in Mota with one exception only. The collect for the day is read in English, as a brief allowable concession to the ears and hearts of the English members of the Mission. The service consists of the greater part of the Church of England Service translated. Some modifications have been made to suit the course of religious instruction. The Psalms are chanted and hymns sung in parts, and always in admirable tune, by the congregation. Noteworthy <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> attention, the reverent attitude, the hearty swing and unison of the little congregation, a lesson, I felt with shame, to many of our white congregations.|$|E
60|$|In {{opposition}} to this assertion we first do positively deny {{that he or}} the Company <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> representative of any sovereign power whatever. They have certain rights by their charter, and by acts of Parliament, {{but they have no}} other. They have their legal rights only, and these do not imply any such thing as sovereign power. The sovereignty of Great Britain is in the King; he is the sovereign of the Lords and the sovereign of the Commons, individually and collectively; and as he has his prerogative established by law, he must exercise it, and all persons claiming and deriving under him, whether by act of Parliament, whether by charter of the Crown, or by any other mode whatever, all are alike bound by law, and responsible to it. No one can assume or receive any power of sovereignty, because the sovereignty is in the Crown, and cannot be delegated away from the Crown; no such delegation ever took place, or ever was intended, as any one may see in the act by which Mr. Hastings was nominated Governor. He cannot, therefore, exercise that high supreme sovereignty which is vested by the law, with the consent of both Houses of Parliament, in the King, and in the King only. It is a violent, rebellious assumption of power, when Mr. Hastings pretends fully, perfectly, and entirely to represent the sovereign of this country, and to exercise legislative, executive, and judicial authority, with as large and broad a sway as his Majesty, acting with the consent of the two Houses of Parliament, and agreeably to the laws of this kingdom. I say, my Lords, this is a traitorous and rebellious assumption, which he has no right to make, and which we charge against him, and therefore it cannot be urged in justification of his conduct in any respect.|$|E

60|$|We {{have spoken}} of Macaulay's {{interests}} and intuitions wearing a certain air of superficiality; {{there is a}} feeling of the same kind about his attempts to be genial. It is not truly festive. There is no abandonment in it. It has no deep root in moral humour, and is merely a literary form, resembling nothing so much as the hard geniality of some clever college tutor of stiff manners, entertaining undergraduates at an official breakfast-party. This is not because his tone is bookish; on the contrary, his tone and level are distinctly those of the man of the world. But one always seems to find that neither a wide range of cultivation, nor familiar access to the best Whig circles, had quite removed the stiffness and self-conscious precision of the Clapham Sect. We would give much for a little more flexibility, and would welcome ever so slight a consciousness of infirmity. As has been said, the only people whom men cannot pardon <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect.</b> Macaulay is like the military king who never suffered himself to be seen, even by the attendants in his bed-chamber, until he had had time to put on his uniform and jack-boots. His severity of eye is very wholesome; it makes his writing firm, and firmness is certainly one of the first qualities that good writing must have. But {{there is such a thing}} as soft and considerate precision, as well as hard and scolding precision. Those most interesting English critics of the generation slightly anterior to Macaulay,--Hazlitt, Lamb, De Quincey, Leigh Hunt,--were fully his equals in precision, and yet they knew how to be clear, acute, and definite, without that edginess and inelasticity which is so conspicuous in Macaulay's criticisms, alike in their matter and their form.|$|E
