5|$|In eukaryotes, {{modifications}} of RNA nucleotides are in general directed by small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA; 60–300nt), {{found in the}} nucleolus and cajal bodies. snoRNAs associate with enzymes <b>and</b> <b>guide</b> them to a spot on an RNA by basepairing to that RNA. These enzymes then perform the nucleotide modification. rRNAs and tRNAs are extensively modified, but snRNAs and mRNAs can also be the target of base modification. RNA can also be methylated.|$|E

5|$|For visual course control, flies' optic {{flow field}} is {{analyzed}} {{by a set}} of motion-sensitive neurons. A subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using the optic flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion, such as yaw, roll, and sideward translation. Other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself, such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax. The H1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly, allowing the fly to generate <b>and</b> <b>guide</b> stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw. The ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity, enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an object.|$|E
5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences <b>and</b> <b>guide</b> the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E
