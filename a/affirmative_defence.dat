50|$|A {{successful}} <b>affirmative</b> <b>defence</b> {{means not}} that {{a criminal act}} was justified, but that the act was not criminal at all. But if no <b>affirmative</b> <b>defence</b> of duress is available, then the duress may be considered as justifying a lighter sentence, typically {{in proportion to the}} degree of duress. If the duress is extreme enough, for example, the defendant might be found guilty of murder but given a minimal, or even trivial, sentence.|$|E
50|$|In some rare cases, a {{successful}} argument of duress -- even when not an <b>affirmative</b> <b>defence</b> -- {{might result in}} the jury nullifying the charge by refusing to convict.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{on the law}} in the jurisdiction, the {{prosecution}} may be required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not entrapped or the defendant may be required to prove that they were entrapped as an <b>affirmative</b> <b>defence.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{delivered}} {{as part of}} a panel entitled “The Justness of Criminal Justice: How has the Charter Changed the Problems We Face?” Participants were asked to “reflect on the social justice issues raised {{in the criminal justice system}} and how those issues have remained, changed or been redressed over the life of the Charter”. The author’s the sis is: (1) the criminal justice system is overflowing with social justice issues; (2) the most significant insight about the criminal justice system in the past 30 years is that criminal law raises equality values; (3) the Charter has had something (but not much) to do with raising that claim; (4) it would be naive to assume that Charter rights could singlehandedly ameliorate the multi-dimensional nature of the social injustice perpetrated by the criminal justice system; and (5) the Charter’s most important role in improving the system is in its potential to “unearth, render visible and potentiate criminal justice responses to systemic inequality”. The paper examines two areas in which the Charter has had a significant impact on how criminal justice issues are conceptualized. The first is in the construction of blame and the move away from a simplistic subjectivism. The second is in the overt recognition of the equality dimensions of many criminal law problems such as, for example, sexual assault, intoxication and the <b>affirmative</b> <b>defences.</b> The author concludes by examining three recent cases in which equality values have played a significant role: R. v. Tran, Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford and R. v. Ipeelee, along with two recent sentencing decisions where equality arguments were unsuccessful (R. v. Nur and R. v. Johnson). While acknowledging that equality raises challenging questions which are complex and multifaceted, the author nevertheless insists that our professional commitments to democracy and social justice require that it be taken seriously...|$|R

50|$|In {{the common}} law of libel, the {{claimant}} has the burden only of proving that the statement {{was made by the}} defendant, and that it was defamatory. These things are generally relatively easy to prove. The claimant is not required to prove that the statement was false. Instead, proving the truth of the statement is an <b>affirmative</b> <b>defence</b> available to the defendant.|$|E
5000|$|In {{criminal}} law, the defendant's {{motive for}} breaking the law is generally irrelevant unless a defendant is raising an affirmative defense allowed for by law. (Duress {{may or may not}} be allowed as an <b>affirmative</b> <b>defence</b> for some particular charge -- in particular, it is generally forbidden for murder, and many jurisdictions also forbid it for sexual assault. Malum in se offences, generally, are less likely to recognise duress as a defence than malum prohibitum offences.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Under New York law, for example: § 40.15 Mental {{disease or}} defect. In any {{prosecution}} for an offense, {{it is an}} <b>affirmative</b> <b>defence</b> that when the defendant engaged in the proscribed conduct, he lacked criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect. Such lack of criminal responsibility means {{that at the time}} of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate either: 1. The nature and consequences of such conduct; or 2. That such conduct was wrong. N.Y. Penal Law, § 40.15 ...|$|E
50|$|The Defence (equivalent to an Answer) {{must state}} which {{allegations}} of the Particulars of Claim are admitted, which allegations are denied, and which allegations {{the defendant is}} unable to admit or deny, but which the claimant is required to prove. A defendant must give reasons for any denial, and must put forward {{his or her own}} version of events if different from the claimant's version. The Rules do not speak to affirmative defences (save that CPR PD 16 paragraph 13.1 requires the defendant to give details of the expiry of any limitation period relied on), but a concise statement of any facts relied on in support of any <b>affirmative</b> <b>defence</b> {{should be included in the}} Defence.|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} a timely and critical reappraisal of the interconnected, but discrete, doctrines {{of loss of}} self-control, under ss 54 – 56 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, and self-defence within s. 76 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. The loss of control conceptualisation renders it difficult for defendants to claim the partial defence where exculpatory self-defence has been rejected, and fear of serious violence is adduced. This doctrinal incoherence has been exacerbated {{by the fact that}} s. 43 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 effectively legitimises the use of disproportionate force in self-defence, but only in ‘startled householder’ cases. A more appropriate avenue of reform is provided by developments in Australian jurisdictions. This comparative extirpation engages the introduction of a new partial defence of self-preservation/psychological self-defence predicated on the notion of excessive utilisation of force in self-defence as in New South Wales, supplemented with a ‘social framework’ provision, akin to that in Victoria. The new defence would avoid the problems associated with requiring the abused woman to establish a loss of self-control and/or affording an <b>affirmative</b> <b>defence</b> in ‘startled householder’ cases...|$|E
