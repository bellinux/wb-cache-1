40|$|Manually landing an {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle presents unique challenges since unmanned vehicle pilots require extensive {{training to}} become proficient in the landing task. Operators must therefore choose between a pilot controlling the vehicle from a ground station, or procurement of an automatic landing system. Although several autoland controllers exist for small or micro unmanned vehicles and for large unmanned vehicles, very few are available for medium sized {{unmanned aerial vehicle}}s (about {{the size of a}} small general aviation aircraft). Additionally, medium sized unmanned aerial vehicles often have limited sensors and instrumentation yet must possess good performance in the presence of modeling uncertainties and external disturbances such as turbulence. This paper describes the synthesis and development of a discrete Quantitative Feedback Theory automatic landing controller for medium size unmanned aerial vehicles. Quantitative Feedback Theory is an attractive control methodology that provides good performance and robustness for a system with structured model uncertainties. It has been successfully applied to many aircraft problems, but not to automatic landing. Controllers for the localizer, glideslope tracker, and <b>automatic</b> <b>flare</b> are developed, as well as details of the inner-loop synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Autoland {{controllers}} are prevalent {{for both}} large and small/micro unmanned aerial vehicles, but very few are available for medium-sized unmanned air vehicles. These vehicles tend to have limited sensors and instrumentation, yet must possess good performance {{in the presence of}} modeling uncertainties and exogenous inputs such as turbulence. Quantitative feedback theory has been reported in the literature for inner-loop control of several aircraft problems, but not for outer-loop control or for automatic landing. This paper describes the synthesis and development of an automatic landing controller for medium-sized unmanned aerial vehicles, using discrete quantitative feedback theory. Controllers for the localizer, glideslope tracker, and <b>automatic</b> <b>flare</b> are developed, with a focus on outer-loop synthesis and robustness with respect to model uncertainty. Linear, non-real-time, six-degree-of-freedom Monte Carlo simulation is used to compare the quantitative feedback theory controller with a baseline proportional–integral controller in several still-air and turbulent-air landing scenarios. Results presented in the paper show that the quantitative feedback theory controller provides superior performance robustness to the proportional–integral controller in turbulent-air conditions when model uncertainties are present. It is therefore concluded to be a promising candidate for an autoland controller for unmanned air vehicles. Nomenclatur...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring of the Sun and its {{activity}} {{is a task}} of growing importance {{in the frame of}} space weather research and awareness. Major space weather disturbances at Earth have their origin in energetic outbursts from the Sun: solar flares, coronal mass ejections and associated solar energetic particles. In this review we discuss the importance and complementarity of ground-based and space-based observations for space weather studies. The main focus is drawn on ground-based observations in the visible range of the spectrum, in particular in the diagnostically manifold Hα spectral line, which enables us to detect and study solar flares, filaments, filament eruptions, and Moreton waves. Existing Hα networks such as the GONG and the Global High-Resolution Hα Network are discussed. As an example of solar observations from space weather research to operations, we present the system of real-time detection of Hα flares and filaments established at Kanzelhöhe Observatory (KSO; Austria) in the frame of the ESA Space Situational Awareness programme. During the evaluation period 7 / 2013 - 11 / 2015, KSO provided 3020 hours of real-time Hα observations at the SWE portal. In total, 824 Hα flares were detected and classified by the real-time detection system, including 174 events of Hα importance class 1 and larger. For the total sample of events, 95 % of the automatically determined flare peak times lie within ± 5 min of the values given in the official optical flares reports (by NOAA and KSO), and 76 % of the start times. The heliographic positions determined are better than ± 5 ^∘. The probability of detection of flares of importance 1 or larger is 95 %, with a false alarm rate of 16 %. These numbers confirm the high potential of <b>automatic</b> <b>flare</b> detection and alerting from ground-based observatories.

40|$|Abstract. The {{focus of}} the <b>automatic</b> solar <b>flare</b> {{detection}} is {{on the development of}} efficient feature-based classifiers. The three principal techniques used in this work are Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. We have experimented and compared these three methods for solar flare detection on the solar Hα (Hydrogen-Alpha) images obtained from the Big Bear Solar Observatory in California. The preprocessing step is to obtain the nine principal features of the solar flares for the classifiers. Experimental results show that by using SVM, we can obtain the best classification rate of the solar flares. We believe our work will lead to real-time solar flare detection using advanced pattern recognition techniques. 1...|$|R

Partnering with Holman-Moody, the Stroppe/Holman/Moody (SHM) Broncos competed in the Mint 400, Baja 500, and Mexican 1000 (later named the Baja 1000). In 1969, SHM again entered a team of six Broncos in the Baja 1000.

40|$|We {{present a}} new method for <b>automatic</b> {{detection}} of <b>flare</b> events from {{images in the}} optical range. The method uses neural networks for pattern recognition and is conceived {{to be applied to}} full-disk Halphaimages. Images are analyzed in real time, which allows for the design of automatic patrol processes able to detect and record flare events with the best time resolution available without human assistance. We use a neural network consisting of two layers, a hidden layer of nonlinear neurodes and an output layer of one linear neurode. The network was trained using a back-propagation algorithm and a set of full- disk solar images obtained by HASTA (HalphaSolar Telescope for Argentina), which is located at the Estacion de Altura Ulrico Cesco of OAFA (Observatorio Astronomico Felix Aguilar), El Leoncito, San Juan, Argentina. This method is appropriate for the detection of solar flares in the complete optical classification, being portable to any Halphainstrument and providing unique criteria for flare detection independent of the observer...|$|R
5000|$|From an {{avionics}} safety perspective, a CAT IIIc landing is the [...] "worst-case scenario" [...] {{for safety}} analysis because {{a failure of}} the <b>automatic</b> systems from <b>flare</b> through the roll-out could easily result in a [...] "hard over" [...] (where a control surface deflects fully in one direction.) This would happen so fast that the flight crew may not effectively respond. For this reason Autoland systems are designed to incorporate a high degree of redundancy so that a single failure of any part of the system can be tolerated (fail active) and a second failure can be detected - at which point the autoland system will turn itself off (uncouple, fail passive). One way of accomplishing this is to have [...] "three of everything." [...] Three ILS receivers, three radio altimeters, three flight control computers, and three ways of controlling the flight surfaces. The three flight control computers all work in parallel and are in constant cross communications, comparing their inputs (ILS receivers and radio altimeters) with those of the other two flight control computers. If there is a difference in inputs, then a computer can [...] "vote out" [...] the deviant input and will notify the other computers that [...] "RA1 is faulty." [...] If the outputs don't match, a computer can declare itself as faulty and, if possible, take itself off line.|$|R
40|$|Observations of the {{transient}} radio sky {{provide an}} insight into the most dynamic and energetic events in the Universe. The exploration of transient and variable sources, {{for a long time}} primarily focused on higher frequencies, has recently been extended to the long wavelength regime, with the development of facilities such as the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). In this work I describe the general design of LOFAR as well as details of the commissioning work performed during the early stages of operation. Secondly, I perform an analysis of the first dedicated LOFAR transient survey [...] the Radio Sky Monitor. The investigation is focused on exploring 30 seconds time-scale images and allows us to place an upper limit on the expected areal densities of fast radio transients in the low frequency sky. It also provides spectral index constraints on the previously found, first LOFAR transient event. I also investigate the relation between the radio luminosities and variability time-scales across a wide range of sources â from nearby flare stars to distant supermassive black holes. The results are discussed in context of the potential use as a classification method, as well as in comparison with the expected brightness temperature of the events. The relation is used as a base for building a tool which classifies (with a given probability) an observed event, depending on the measured rise/decline rates of the flare. It includes the <b>automatic</b> selection of <b>flares</b> and takes into account the estimated areal densities of different classes of objects. Lastly, I discuss the results of the luminosity â time-scale correlation in context of the estimation of the kinetic power, as well as future prospects of implementing the presented classification method into an automated transient detection pipeline for instruments such as MeerKAT and the Square Kilometer Array. </p...|$|R
