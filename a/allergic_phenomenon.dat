40|$|Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a {{condition}} that involves eosinophilic influx into the esophageal epithelium. It affects both children and adults; Adults present with dysphagia whereas children with vague abdominal complaints. The clinical symptoms as well as pathologic features of EoE and gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) are similar. Since eosinophilia in the esophagus is a non-specific finding, the clinical presentation in conjunction with endoscopic findings and pathology, is crucial in determining a differential diagnosis. Infections such as parasites, <b>allergic</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> Crohn's disease, malignancies, medication, and chemotherapy are all associated with eosinophilia. A primary endoscopic difference to note between EoE and GERD is that EoE often involves long segments of the esophagus, could be patchy or focal and frequently involves the proximal esophagus. GERD, however, typically involves the distal much more frequently than the proximal esophagus. Because of the similarity between them, GERD should be excluded by using high dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment or through evidence of a normal pH by esophageal testing, prior to treatment with an elimination diet or steroids. Until further research establishes different diagnostic tests and criteria, clinical and pathological response to therapy {{is considered to be}} the absolute confirmation of this diagnosis. The following is a more detailed discussion of this entity...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hereditary, {{environmental}} and developmental factors {{play an important}} role in dentofacial development, as well as the initiation of malocclusion disorder. <b>Allergic</b> <b>phenomenon</b> such as asthma that induces an alternative mode of breathing in patients is a contributing factor in development of the dental arch. Aim: Our aim in this study was to evaluate the dentoalveolar morphology in asthmatic children and to analyze the effects of asthmatic medications on the dental arch. Setting and Design : This study is centered on 44 asthmatic children aged between 6 - 12 years from J. S. S Hospital, Mysore. Selected variables from model analysis of the casts of the asthmatic group were subjected to comparison with those of the non-asthmatic group, which comprised of 44 non-asthmatic children. Selected parameters were arch width, arch length and palatal depth. Materials and Methods : Impressions of upper and lower arches were made with rubber based impression material. A sliding digital caliper was used to measure the casts for arch width and arch length. A palatal depth gauge was used to measure the palatal depth. Statistical Analysis : Differences in arch widths, arch lengths and palatal depths between asthmatics and non-asthmatics groups were evaluated by independent sample t-tests. Chi-square test was applied to assess the frequency of occurrence of malocclusion in the asthmatic children. Result: The results obtained revealed that the arch length and palatal depth of asthmatic group had higher values compared to that of non-asthmatic groups for both age groups (6 to 8 -year-old males and females, 10 to 12 -year-old males and females). Inter molar width showed a significant lower value in asthmatics in the maxillary arches of 10 to 12 -year-old females. Fifty percent of the asthmatic children aged 10 to 12 -years had open-bite. Children under regular medication showed significant deviation in the dentoalveolar morphology as compared to those under irregular medication. Conclusion: The present study proves a strong relation between asthma and dentoalveolar morphology...|$|E
40|$|There {{are certain}} {{clinical}} and experimental data indicating that allergy or hypersensitiveness may {{play an important}} r 61 e {{in the production of}} pneumococcus lobar pneumonia. Lauche (1) has pointed out that infants under 4 months of age seldom contract lobar pneumonia. This apparent insusceptibility he attributes to their not yet having had opportunity to become sensitized to the pneumococcus. He contends that as individuals grow older they come into contact with the pneumococcus or even contract mild unrecognizable infections until an occasion may occur when the microorganisms invade the lung tissue and produce a marked infection. The basis of this infection in a sensitized individual is the localization of pneumococci in the hilum lymph nodes or hilum, producing an inflammation which obstructs the lymph flow and reverses its direction toward the periphery thereby carrying the organisms into the lung parenchyma. Lausche believes that the rapid onset of the pneumonic infection is an <b>allergic</b> <b>phenomenon</b> occurring in a sensitized individual. Wadsworth (2) was the first to note that after intratracheal inoculation with pneumococcus cultures a localized inflammation was produced only in animals previously immunized by means of killed cultures of pneumococci. Recently Sharp and Blake (3) have shown that pneumococcus autolysates produce an exudative inflammatory pulmonary lesion in sensitized rabbits, {{and that there is a}} close parallelism between cutaneous and pulmonary hypersensifiveness. From the observations of Tillett and Francis (4) it was shown that a proteinfree, type-specific polysaccharide of the homologous pneumococcus elicits an immediate wheal type of reaction when injected into the skin of patients recovering from pneumococcus lobar pneumonia. However, Finland and Sutliff (5) obtained skin reactions with the specific pneumococcus polysaccharides in a number of hospital patients who had no recent history of pneumonia. Mackenzie (6) showed that intraperitoneal injections of killed and living broth cultures of virulent pneumococci produce in guinea pigs a high degree of active immunity and a serum with strong protective power.

40|$|Abstract. Galectins, {{a family}} of {{endogenous}} lectins, are multifunctional effectors that act at various sites {{and can be used}} in immunohistochemical localization studies of diseased states. Since they form a potentially cooperative and antagonistic network, we tested the hypothesis that histopathological fingerprinting of galectins could refine the molecular understanding of naso-sinusal pathologies. Using non-cross-reactive antibodies against galectin- 1,- 3,- 4,- 7,- 8 and- 9, we characterized the galectin profiles in chronic rhino-sinusitis, nasal polyposis, inverted papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas. The expression, signal location and quanti-tative parameters describing the percentage of positive cells and labeling intensity were assessed for various cases. We discovered that inverted papillomas showed a distinct galectin immunohistochemical profile. Indeed, epithelial overexpres-sion of galectin- 3 (P= 0. 0002), galectin- 4 (P< 10 - 6), galectin- 7 (P< 10 - 6) and galectin- 9 (P< 10 - 6) was observed in inverted papillomas compared to non-malignant diseases. Regarding carcinomas, we observed increased expression of galectin- 9 (P< 10 - 6) in epithelial cells compared to non-tumor patholo-gies.

The major metabolic effects of calcitonin in Paget's disease included the induction of positive calcium balance of + 50 to + 240 mg/day, reduction in hyperphosphatasia and hydroxyprolinuria of 15 to 60 %, and a deceleration of radiocalcium turnover by 12 to 46 %.

Because Th 1 /Th 2 differentiation has been determined by cytokine environment, we investigated how mite-specific helper T cells stimulated in different cytokine environments actually influenced IgE and IgG 4 synthesis, which {{are known to be}} regulatory immunoglobulins for allergic response. Th 0 clones, which were mainly established in the presence of IL- 12, provided a great deal of help for IgG 4 and IgG 1 synthesis, but did not provide help for IgE synthesis, whereas Th 2 clones helped IgE synthesis prominently, and IgG 4 and IgG 1 synthesis marginally. These characteristics of Th 0 clones were also true for Th 0 clones obtained from patients who were successfully treated with desensitization therapy. Furthermore, the differences in helper activity between Th 0 and Th 2 clones were not ascribed solely to soluble factors. These data indicate that IgE and IgG 4 synthesis is differentially regulated by antigen-specific T cells, and that conversion or selection from Th 2 to Th 0 by the addition of IL- 12 may exhibit therapeutic effects...|$|R

Objective: To confi rm whether fungi {{were involved in the}} development of polyposis by examining sensitivity to fungal allergens and potential local contamination by fungal species. Methods: We performed a study of 190 patients with polyposis and 190 controls in which we compared the results of skin prick tests to 12 fungi, total IgE, and specifi c IgE to 15 fungal extracts and nasal fungal cultures. Results: The specifi c fungi eliciting a reaction from the largest proportion of patients in the skin prick tests were Fusarium solani (13. 7 %), Penicillium frequentans (12. 6 %), Trichophyton mentagrophytes (11. 1 %), and Candida albicans (8. 4 %) (P <. 001).

Methods Data were collected in a Dutch birth cohort study by postal questionnaire about 2 months before and 3 months after the birth of the child. Results Of the 3147 infants in the study 1910 (61 %) had two non-allergic parents, of 315 infants (10 %) only the mother was allergic, of 787 infants (25 %) only the father was allergic and 135 (4 %) infants had two allergic parents. If both parents were allergic, 53 % reported that allergy was taken into consideration when they furnished their home and significantly more of their homes were free of cats and free of cigarette smoke; adjusted odds ratio's for two allergic parents vs. two non-allergic parents were 0. 30 (confidence interval (CI) 0. 17 - 0. 50) for the presence of cats and 0. 46 (CI 0. 27 - 0. 75) for smoking in the home. Parental allergy was also associated with having a smooth floor in the baby's bedroom and with postponement of the introduction of fruits and vegetables until the age of 26 weeks. The presence of dogs at home, the prevalence of mothers' smoking during pregnancy and the decision to breast feed were unrelated to parental allergy. Conclusion We conclude that studies on the relationship between allergy in parents and allergy in their offspring should always consider the home environment as a potential confounder.

Elevated plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (vWf) are a well recognized feature of vasculitis and have been taken as an indication of in vivo endothelial cell damage. Plasma factor VIII:C and vWf levels and vWf multimeric pattern were studied in 8 patients with HSP, during active disease and twice during the remission (3 and 9 months later). Plasma vWf multimeric composition was evaluated using low resolution gels which better resolve large vWf multimers. During active disease plasma factor VIII:C, vWf:Ag, and vWf:RCoF were normal in 5 % of patients and increased in three, but in each patient, platelets appeared to aggregate at doses of ristocetin lower than in normals. Furthermore, all patients demonstrated the presence of abnormally large vWf multimers usually found only in platelets and endothelial cells. Three and 9 months later, during remission, in spite of the normalization of factor VIII:C and vWf levels, the abnormal multimers were still detectable, as well as hyper-responsiveness to ristocetin. These findings confirm that damage and/or perturbation of endothelial cells is associated with HSP. Moreover, the persistence of abnormality in the vWf multimeric pattern, when the disease is inactive, suggests that the mechanisms involved operate through the entire clinical course...|$|R
40|$|Among the ‘allergic’ {{conditions}} {{involving the}} lung, asthma {{is the more}} frequent and the most extensively investigated, although asthma itself {{may be caused by}} different disorders. The triggering event in allergic subjects is the reaction allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) that activates mast cells and initiates a complex and redundant inflammatory process, where cells, cytokines and adhesion molecules are involved at different stages. In fact, mucosal eosinophilic inflammation is one of the distinctive features of asthma and the particular T helper type 2 (Th 2) phenotype of allergic patients favours it. In general, the clinical severity of asthma correlates well with the degree of inflammation. None the less, other phenomena such as non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness and remodelling intervene in the pathophysiology of <b>allergic</b> asthma.

METHODS: A total of 257 patients with active arthritis who were taking TNF-&# 945; blockers, including 158 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 87 with ankylosing spondylitis and 12 with psoriatic arthritis, were enrolled in a 5 -year prospective analysis. Patients with overlapping or other rheumatic diseases were excluded. Anthropometric, socioeconomic, demographic and clinical data were evaluated, including the Disease Activity Score- 28, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index and Psoriasis Area Severity Index. Skin conditions were evaluated by two dermatology experts, and in doubtful cases, skin lesion biopsies were performed. Associations between adverse cutaneous events and clinical, demographic and epidemiological variables were determined using the chi-square test, and logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that cell-mediated immunity {{is responsible for}} contact dermatitis, but controversy still exists about the involvement of Type IV immune-reactions in other clinical manifestations following inhalant, oral and parenteral administration of penicillin and semi-synthetic penicillin or cephalosporins. The aim {{of the present study}} was to contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanism responsible for these reactions. Detailed history taking, clinical and immuno-allergological investigation on 161 patients with a history of an allergic reaction to penicillin and/or semisynthetic penicillins and/or cephalosporins was carried out with the following tests: skin tests, patch tests, RAST, PRIST and lymphocyte transformation test. The statistical evaluation of data was performed by X 2 test. Comparative studies were focused on groups of patients who presented a positive reaction to patch test (37) skin test (scratch and intradermal) (42), simultaneous skin and patch test (5) and negative skin test (87). No significant difference was observed among the groups studied, although in positive and skin test, a higher frequency is observed to be associated with anaphylactic shock and eczematous type of reaction. It is not possible however not only, to establish whether this is due to a combined immune-reaction (Type I and IV), orto a causal coexistence of the two mechanisms but even to determine either of <b>allergic</b> or pseudoallergic <b>phenomenon</b> without any accurate immunoallergological test. It is suggested that patch tests be carried out as routine investigations on patients with a systematic reaction to penicillins and/or cephalosporins, regardless of the route of administration...|$|R
40|$|Immunoglobulin E (IgE) -mediated allergy {{occurs when}} our immune system causes a {{reaction}} to otherwise harmless substances (allergens). Allergens are predominantly proteins present in biological materials such as pollens, mites, animal epithelia, moulds and foods. In vitro tests for specific IgE antibodies usually employ an allergen source extract as an antibody capturing reagent. The proportion of allergenic molecules in these biochemically complex extracts may vary. Recombinant allergens may be obtained in large quantities with biotechnological techniques. These proteins can be characterized biochemically and immunologically, resulting in tests with minimal batch-to-batch variation. This thesis describes different uses of recombinant allergens in component-resolved diagnostics (CRD). In CRD, single allergenic proteins are used to establish a sensitization profile of the patient. Two timothy grass (Phleum pratense) pollen allergens, Phl p 11 and Phl p 4, were cloned and expressed as recombinant proteins. They were subsequently characterized and can, for example, {{be used in a}} panel for grass pollen CRD. Single allergens may be useful as diagnostic markers for <b>allergic</b> sensitization. This <b>phenomenon</b> was studied using tropomyosin, a major allergen from the shrimp Penaeus aztecus (Pen a 1). The characteristics of the recombinant and natural proteins were compared. The recombinant tropomyosin was then extensively tested using specific competition for IgE binding against extracts of other crustacean species, house dust mite and cockroach. In cases when an important allergen is missing or underrepresented in a natural extract, the corresponding recombinant allergen may be added to the extract as a spiking reagent. Previous studies have shown that latex extracts for diagnostic testing may lack the allergen Hev b 5. Recombinant Hev b 5 was expressed from a synthetic gene construct, incorporating several adaptations to enable efficient large scale production of the recombinant protein, {{to be used as a}} spiking reagent...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} non-allergic (so-called ‘intrinsic’) asthma. The central {{hypothesis}} of this thesis is that intrinsic asthma might {{be driven by}} a local <b>allergic</b> reaction. A <b>phenomenon</b> that has been, so far, only described in the nose, under the concept of ‘entopy’. In {{the first part of}} this work, we confirmed that intrinsic asthma shares some immunopathological similarities with allergic asthma. In particular, the level of airways IgE production was similar between both phenotypes and can occur independently of a systemic production. Surprisingly, at least a part of this IgE is specific to Der p house dust mite allergens. However, in intrinsic asthmatic, lung exposure to the allergen did not translate into immediate (or late) allergic reaction. Looking at basophils from intrinsic asthma patients, as a model of immediate allergic reaction, suggested that these cells were less prone to activate upon IgE stimulation. We therefore postulated that a second signal was required in intrinsic asthma to promote the IgE-FcERI pathway, which seems constitutively primed in atopic asthma. In the second study, we studied the blood basophils and their signaling machinery, with the hypothesis that basophils from intrinsic asthmatics could be less reactive to IgE than basophils from allergic patients and focusing on Syk tyrosine kinase as critical intracellular signal conditioning IgE responsiveness. We have assessed here the expression of two important surface markers of basophils activation, namely CD 203 c and CD 63, and confirmed difference in the reactivity of basophils from intrinsic asthma vs atopic asthmatics. This finding was associated with a lower expression of Syk in intrinsic asthma, one of the pivotal kinase involved in the signal transduction of FcERI. These two original studies shed new insights into the immunopathological pathways involved in intrinsic asthma, and reinforce the belief that local IgE production has a role to play in some non-allergic asthmatics(SBIM 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
40|$|Our {{experiments}} have confirmed {{the fact that}} the so called bacterial allergies are dependent upon a mechanism which differs materially from that determining true protein anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis to protein substances of the bacteria probably occurs but plays a relatively unimportant rôle in the phenomena of infection. The bacterial allergies, however, are of great importance since they develop rapidly and render the infected animal highly vulnerable to products of the bacterial growth which are relatively innocuous for the normal animal. Neither the type-specific carbohydrate "residue antigens" (the "soluble specific substances" of Avery and Heidelberger) nor the antibodies reacting with them play any part whatever in bacterial allergy, and since these type-specific substances represent the haptophore groups of the whole bacteria by which they react with the agglutinins, precipitins, sensitizers, etc., of immune serum, allergy, as previously determined by Mackenzie and Woo, is in no way related to that phase of resistance which is determined by these antibodies. This does not, however, preclude the possibility that allergic hypersusceptibility may not in some way be related to other factors of resistance more definitely associated with cellular rather than with intravascular reactions. Our previous studies with Jennings and Ward in tuberculosis point in this direction (20). Guinea pigs can be actively sensitized with all the bacteria with which we have worked when repeated injections of whole bacteria or of the protein (nucleoprotein) fraction are administered. Large amounts of the latter are necessary since these materials are indifferent antigens, possibly because of the severe manipulations necessary in their production. Sensitiveness develops usually within 10 days after the first dose and increases with continued treatment for 3 or 4 weeks. Sensitiveness is relatively specific, by which we mean that there is a definite specificity which, however, in highly sensitive animals is not absolute and shows considerable overlapping. Continued treatment with considerable quantities of the above substances leads to gradual desensitization in animals in which there are no chronic foci present, which, as in tuberculosis, tends to continue the sensitization. Attempts at passive sensitization have been irregular and inconclusive. When any degree of sensitiveness has developed after the injection of immune sera, it has appeared late and has been of doubtful specificity. Conversely we have failed in any case to neutralize the activity of the active allergic constituents of bacterial extracts by incubation with any type of immune serum. We have failed so far to show any increased fixation of tuberculin material on the part of tuberculous tissues or on that of living tuberculous animals. These failures, however, seem to us of relatively slight importance since quantitative experiments of this nature are extremely difficult {{in the case of a}} substance as delicately potent for the tuberculous animal. On the other hand we have obtained definite, though irregular evidence that the incubation of O. T. with fragments of tuberculous lung tissue (less clearly with other tissues) leads to the formation of a substance that produces allergy-like lesions in the skin of normal guinea pigs. With somewhat greater regularity, similar treatment of O. T. has enhanced the potency of the tuberculin for tuberculous animals. And, in these experiments there was evidence that the factor responsible for this action was not easily separable from the cells themselves. When these experimental data are analytically considered they appear in many respects confusing and contradictory. There has been so much work done on the tuberculin reaction, moreover, that, in the face of experimental inconsistencies it would seem foolhardy to formulate more than tentative suggestions to explain the mechanism of these reactions. Nevertheless there are a few outstanding and sufficiently reliable facts which compel a limited number of definite deductions. In the first place there is no question of the complete independence of the true <b>allergic</b> <b>phenomena</b> from the ordinary bacterial antigen-antibody reactions. We know, moreover, that the allergic substance is chemically separable from the carbohydrate "residue" or haptophore group of the bacteria (Mueller, Laidlaw and Dudley). Indeed it has been shown by Long and Seibert (21) that the active allergic substance is either a protein in itself, or at any rate closely associated with the bacterial protein. Furthermore, the distinct, though limited, specificity of the allergic sensitiveness compels the conclusion that we are dealing with an immunological process in which the tissue cells acquire an increased specific capacity to react with this nitrogenous material, a capacity which, in principle, is not far removed from the supposed "sessile receptor" apparatus which is conventionally held responsible for protein anaphylaxis; and this analogy is further amplified by the apparent desensitization which continued treatment produced in many of our own experiments as well as in those of Mackenzie and Woo. Here, however, the analogy with protein anaphylaxis ends. Passive sensitization with any form of immune serum or with the sera of highly sensitized animals is either feeble or entirely unsuccessful and indicates quite convincingly that, whatever the receptor apparatus of the cells may be, it is not easily given up to the blood stream as are ordinary antibodies. Further than this, our tissue-tuberculin experiments, irregular and occasional as they were, nevertheless convinced us that: 1. The contact with the tissues of tuberculous animals results in the production of a toxic factor, not unlike the autolytic toxic materials of some bacteria. 2. The active cell constituent by which this action is wrought, is not easily separated from the cells, even by energetic methods of extraction. This close association of the entire process with the cells themselves is particularly significant in view of the obvious cell injury in which these delayed allergic effects differ from the ordinary urticarial, evanescent reactions associated with protein anaphylaxis. The process of allergy, as far as we can approach it then, may be conceived as follows: A nitrogenous, probably protein, constituent of the bacterial growth or of its body substance stimulates a specific reaction in the tissue cell by which its specific capacity to establish contact with this constituent is enhanced. The cell is thereby enabled to exert a, probably, enzyme-like effect upon this material in consequence of which a toxic substance is liberated, largely upon or possibly within the cell itself. Both processes may be dependent upon one and the same reaction body. But it seems more likely that increased contact and the increased cell activity are separately developed, an assumption which is rendered probable by the association of the highest degrees of allergy with inflammatory cell reactions, and by the fact that moderate and less specific allergic sensitiveness follows 10 or more days after the administration of considerable amounts of indifferent protein substances to guinea pigs. We interpret this as signifying that such injections may non-speciffcally increase cellular activity, a change which many earlier workers have spoken of as "cell irritability. " Both processes are closely associated with the altered cell itself and the factors by which the reaction is brought about are not easily given up to the blood stream as are the antibodies formed in response to injections of proteins or whole bacteria. We are confronted, therefore, with an immunological mechanism which has some close analogies to those others in which circulating antibodies are formed, but which differs from these mainly in the intimacy with which the entire reacting system is associated with the cells themselves. It is difficult to conceive that a functional cell alteration, as profound as this, should be entirely unrelated to the phenomena of susceptibility or resistance...|$|R
