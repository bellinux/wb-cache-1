5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the condition represents a state of heightened sensitivity to <b>antigenic</b> stimuli, with cross-reactivity of the resulting cell-mediated immune response with cells of the epithelium. Some hypothesize that aphthous stomatitis is caused by expression of HLA class II antigens along with the normally found HLA class I antigens in epithelial cells, which results in them being recognized by the immune system as foreign cells rather than self. Various <b>antigenic</b> triggers have been implicated as a trigger, including L forms of streptococci, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus.|$|E
5|$|VP6 {{forms the}} bulk of the capsid. It is highly <b>antigenic</b> and can be used to {{identify}} rotavirus species. This protein is used in laboratory tests for rotavirus A infections.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} new {{medications}} are under study for treating gout, including anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept. Canakinumab may result in better outcomes than a low dose of a steroid but costs five thousand times more. A recombinant uricase enzyme (rasburicase) is available; its use, however, is limited, as it triggers an immune response. Less <b>antigenic</b> versions are in development.|$|E
5|$|Often, once an {{antibody}} and antigen bind, {{they become}} an immune complex, which {{functions as a}} unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, haptens are small molecules that provoke no immune response by themselves, but once they bind to proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier adduct is <b>antigenic.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1966, a {{paramyxovirus}} {{with some}} <b>antigenic</b> similarity to Newcastle disease was {{isolated from the}} brain of a turquoise parrot in the Netherlands. That year, many aviary species including several species of Australian parrot {{and members of the}} genus Neophema had exhibited neurological symptoms reminiscent of Newcastle disease. Like other members of the genus, the turquoise parrot is highly sensitive to avian paramyxovirus infection. It is one of many species of parrot that can host the nematode Ascaridia platyceri.|$|E
5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} pathogens when antibodies on {{its surface}} bind to a specific foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is {{taken up by the}} B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these <b>antigenic</b> peptides {{on its surface}} MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the T cell-mediated {{mechanism}} of mucosal destruction is strong, but the exact triggers for this process are unknown and {{are thought to}} be multiple and varied from one person to the next. This suggests {{that there are a number}} of possible triggers, each of which is capable of producing the disease in different subgroups. In other words, different subgroups appear to have different causes for the condition. These can be considered in three general groups, namely primary immuno-dysregulation, decrease of the mucosal barrier and states of heightened <b>antigenic</b> sensitivity (see below). Risk factors in aphthous stomatitis are also sometimes considered as either host-related or environmental.|$|E
25|$|In recent work, Bedford {{and colleagues}} used an {{agent-based}} model {{to show that}} evolution in a Euclidean <b>antigenic</b> space can account for the phylogenetic pattern of influenza A/H3N2's HA, {{as well as the}} virus's <b>antigenic,</b> epidemiological, and geographic patterns.|$|E
25|$|HA {{codes for}} hemagglutinin, an <b>antigenic</b> {{glycoprotein}} {{found on the}} surface of the influenza viruses and is responsible for binding the virus to the cell that is being infected. NA codes for neuraminidase, an <b>antigenic</b> glycosylated enzyme found {{on the surface of}} the influenza viruses. It facilitates the release of progeny viruses from infected cells.|$|E
25|$|This model {{showed that}} <b>antigenic</b> {{emergence}} and replacement could result under certain epidemiological conditions.|$|E
25|$|Influenza B {{virus is}} almost {{exclusively}} a human pathogen, and is less common than influenza A. The only other animal {{known to be}} susceptible to influenza B infection is the seal. This type of influenza mutates at a rate 2–3 times lower than type A and consequently is less genetically diverse, with only one influenza B serotype. As {{a result of this}} lack of <b>antigenic</b> diversity, a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age. However, influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible. This reduced rate of <b>antigenic</b> change, combined with its limited host range (inhibiting cross species <b>antigenic</b> shift), ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur.|$|E
25|$|These two glycoproteins are {{the targets}} of {{numerous}} serologic reactions and tests including neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition. The alphaviruses show various degrees of <b>antigenic</b> cross-reactivity in these reactions and this forms {{the basis for the}} seven <b>antigenic</b> complexes, 30 species and many subtypes and varieties. The E2 protein is the site of most neutralizing epitopes, while the E1 protein contains more conserved, cross-reactive epitopes.|$|E
25|$|Genetic and <b>antigenic</b> {{variation}} of influenza is also present across a diverse set of host species.|$|E
25|$|These <b>antigenic</b> {{dynamics}} {{would be}} consistent with a ladder-like phylogeny of influenza exhibiting low genetic diversity and continual strain turnover.|$|E
25|$|In these cases, it {{is thought}} that short host lifespans prevent the {{build-up}} of host immunity necessary to effectively drive <b>antigenic</b> drift.|$|E
25|$|Typically, ADEM {{appears in}} {{children}} following an <b>antigenic</b> challenge and remains monophasic. Nevertheless, ADEM does occur in adults, {{and can also}} be clinically multiphasic.|$|E
25|$|An 11th {{has also}} been described. This protein is encoded by a +1 {{frameshift}} in the capsid gene. It appears to be <b>antigenic</b> but its function is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{modeling}} the genotypes of viral strains, a compartmental simulation model by Gökaydin and colleagues considered influenza evolution at {{the scale of}} <b>antigenic</b> clusters (or phenotypes).|$|E
25|$|Other genetic {{mutations}} besides hemoglobin abnormalities that confer resistance to Plasmodia infection involve alterations of the cellular surface <b>antigenic</b> proteins, cell membrane structural proteins, or enzymes involved in glycolysis.|$|E
25|$|The other MHC class II proteins, DM and DO, {{are used}} in the {{internal}} processing of antigens, loading the <b>antigenic</b> peptides generated from pathogens onto the HLA molecules of antigen-presenting cell.|$|E
25|$|Through {{incorporating}} this {{mapping of}} viral genotype into viral phenotype (or <b>antigenic</b> cluster) into their model, the authors {{were able to}} reproduce the ladder-like phylogeny of influenza's HA protein without generalized strain-transcending immunity.|$|E
25|$|Later during development, {{individual}} CDR {{loops of}} TCR can be re-edited in the periphery outside thymus by reactivation of recombinases using a process termed TCR revision (editing) and change its <b>antigenic</b> specificity.|$|E
25|$|Viral phylodynamics {{is defined}} as the study of how epidemiological, immunological, and {{evolutionary}} processes act and potentially interact to shape viral phylogenies. spatio-temporal dynamics including metapopulation dynamics, zoonotic transmission, tissue tropism, and <b>antigenic</b> drift.|$|E
25|$|After {{introduction}} {{into the}} human population, a lineage of influenza generally persists through <b>antigenic</b> drift, in which HA and NA continually accumulate mutations allowing viruses to infect hosts immune to earlier forms of the virus.|$|E
25|$|Since Graves' {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disease which appears suddenly, often later in life, a viral or bacterial infection may trigger antibodies which cross-react {{with the human}} TSH receptor, a phenomenon known as <b>antigenic</b> mimicry.|$|E
25|$|When the TCR {{engages with}} <b>antigenic</b> peptide and MHC (peptide/MHC), the T {{lymphocyte}} is activated through signal transduction, that is, {{a series of}} biochemical events mediated by associated enzymes, co-receptors, specialized adaptor molecules, and activated or released transcription factors.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people have}} a serious latex allergy, and {{exposure}} to natural latex rubber products such as latex gloves can cause anaphylactic shock. The <b>antigenic</b> proteins found in Hevea latex may be deliberately reduced (though not eliminated) through processing.|$|E
25|$|Stem cell markers: iPSCs {{expressed}} cell surface <b>antigenic</b> markers expressed on ESCs. Human iPSCs {{expressed the}} markers specific to hESC, including SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, TRA-2-49/6E, and Nanog. Mouse iPSCs expressed SSEA-1 but not SSEA-3 nor SSEA-4, similarly to mESCs.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{products}} of this hydrolysis are polypeptides, and smaller products are called simply peptides; these are called wheat protein hydrolysates. These hydrolysates can create allergens out of wheat proteins that previously {{did not exist}} by the exposure of buried <b>antigenic</b> sites in the proteins.|$|E
25|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{is supported by}} empirical patterns of <b>antigenic</b> evolution; there have been nine vaccine updates recommended by the WHO for H1N1 in the interpandemic period between 1978 and 2009, while there have been 20 vaccine updates recommended for H3N2 during this same time period.|$|E
25|$|MHC class II {{molecules}} in humans have {{five to six}} isotypes. Classic molecules present peptides to CD4+ lymphocytes. Nonclassic molecules, accessories, with intracellular functions, are not exposed on cell membranes, but in internal membranes in lysosomes, normally loading the <b>antigenic</b> peptides onto classic MHC class II molecules.|$|E
25|$|The {{detection}} of many antigens can be dramatically improved by antigen retrieval methods that act by breaking {{some of the}} protein cross-links formed by fixation to uncover hidden <b>antigenic</b> sites. This {{can be accomplished by}} heating for varying lengths of times (heat induced epitope retrieval or HIER) or using enzyme digestion (proteolytic induced epitope retrieval or PIER).|$|E
25|$|A fimbria {{also known}} as a pilus is a short, thin, hair-like {{filament}} found on the surface of bacteria. Fimbriae, or pili are formed of a protein called pilin (<b>antigenic)</b> and are responsible for attachment of bacteria to specific receptors of human cell (cell adhesion). There are special types of specific pili involved in bacterial conjugation.|$|E
25|$|Immunity is the {{capability}} of multicellular organisms to resist harmful microorganisms from entering it. Immunity involves both specific and nonspecific components. The nonspecific components act as barriers or eliminators {{of a wide range}} of pathogens irrespective of their <b>antigenic</b> make-up. Other components of the immune system adapt themselves to each new disease encountered and are able to generate pathogen-specific immunity.|$|E
25|$|When {{proteins}} are {{cut into}} polypeptides, buried regions {{are exposed to}} the surface, and these buried regions may possibly be <b>antigenic.</b> Such hydrolyzed wheat protein is used as an additive in foods and cosmetics. The peptides are often 1 kD in size (9 amino acid residues in length) and may increase the allergic response. These wheat polypeptides can cause immediate contact urticaria in susceptible people.|$|E
25|$|Work by Koelle {{and colleagues}} {{revisited}} {{the dynamics of}} influenza A/H3N2 evolution following {{the publication of a}} paper by Smith and colleagues which showed that the <b>antigenic</b> evolution of the virus occurred in a punctuated manner. The phylodynamic model designed by Koelle and coauthors argued that this pattern reflected a many-to-one genotype-to-phenotype mapping, with the possibility of strains from antigenically distinct clusters of influenza sharing a high degree of genetic similarity.|$|E
