5|$|Quantitative easing (QE) is the {{practice}} in which <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> tries to mitigate a potential or actual recession by increasing the money supply for its domestic economy. This {{can be done by}} printing money and injecting it into the domestic economy via open market operations. There may be a promise to destroy any newly created money once the economy improves in order to avoid inflation.|$|E
5|$|A third {{method is}} for {{authorities}} simply to talk down {{the value of}} their currency by hinting at future action to discourage speculators from betting on a future rise, though sometimes this has little discernible effect. Finally, <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> can effect a devaluation by lowering its base rate of interest; however this sometimes has limited effect, and, since the end of World War II, most central banks have set their base rate according to the needs of their domestic economy.|$|E
5|$|The ECB targets {{interest}} rates rather than exchange rates {{and in general}} does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets. This {{is because of the}} implications of the Mundell–Fleming model, which implies <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> cannot (without capital controls) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency. In the years following the Single European Act, the EU has liberalised its capital markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible, or floating. The result of the ECB maintaining historically low {{interest rates}} and restricting money supply has been that over the last decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of Europe's main trading partners. However, in 2010, the euro started on a sharp decline. Starting at U.S$1.60 in 2008, and dropping to US$1.04 in 2015.In the following months € recovered till the value of 1.19 U.S.$.

50|$|An {{explicit}} numerical inflation target increases <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank's</b> accountability, {{and thus}} it is less likely that the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> falls prey to the time-inconsistency trap. This accountability is especially significant because even countries with weak institutions can build public support for <b>an</b> independent <b>central</b> <b>bank.</b> Institutional commitment can also insulate the bank from political pressure to undertake an overly expansionary monetary policy.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{hypothesis}} that <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank's</b> asymmetric preferences are able to explain inflation rate in a developing country. In addition, it seeks to help comprehend movements of inflation rate in Jordan and to understand <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> of Jordan preferences regarding inflation rate and output. Design/methodology/approach – A standard monetary model consists of <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank's</b> loss function and an economy structure is constructed, which acts as a constraint on the <b>central</b> <b>bank's</b> behavior. Then, <b>a</b> distribute-lag version of the derived model is estimated using ordinary least squares method. Findings – The empirical evidence from the Jordanian economy shows that inflation rate relies on the variances of inflation rate and the variances of output. This finding supports the hypothesis that <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank's</b> asymmetric loss function is able to justify inflation rate movements. Moreover, the Jordanian central banker prefers higher inflation rate and higher level of output. Originality/value – The paper provides evidence from a developing country regarding the ability of the asymmetric <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> preferences to justify inflation rate movement. In addition, the paper links central banks' losses with the uncertainty level and inflation rate in the economy. <b>Central</b> <b>banks,</b> Developing countries, Inflation, Jordan, Monetary policy...|$|R
5|$|The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on {{a monthly}} basis back to 1854; {{according}} to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe. Factors that may have contributed to this moderation include the creation of <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> and lender of last resort, like the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the establishment of deposit insurance {{in the form of the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933, increased regulation of the banking sector, the adoption of interventionist Keynesian economics, and the increase in automatic stabilizers in the form of government programs (unemployment insurance, social security, and later Medicare and Medicaid). See Post-World War II economic expansion for further discussion.|$|E
5|$|The United States Congress {{passed the}} Federal Reserve Act in 1913, {{giving rise to}} the Federal Reserve System. Its {{inception}} drew influence from the Panic of 1907, underpinning legislators' hesitance in trusting individual investors, such as John Pierpont Morgan, to serve again as a lender of last resort. The system's design also considered {{the findings of the}} Pujo Committee's investigation of the possibility of a money trust in which Wall Street's concentration of influence over national financial matters was questioned and in which investment bankers were suspected of unusually deep involvement in the directorates of manufacturing corporations. Although the committee's findings were inconclusive, the very possibility was enough to motivate support for the long-resisted notion of establishing <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank.</b> The Federal Reserve's overarching aim was to become the sole lender of last resort and to resolve the inelasticity of the United States' money supply during significant shifts in money demand. In addition to addressing the underlying issues that precipitated the international ramifications of the 1907 money market crunch, New York's banks were liberated from the need to maintain their own reserves and began undertaking greater risks. New access to rediscount facilities enabled them to launch foreign branches, bolstering New York's rivalry with London's competitive discount market.|$|E

The looser the exchange rate peg, the more latitude the central bank has to target other variables (such as interest rates). It may instead target a basket of foreign currencies rather than a single currency. In some instances it is empowered to use additional means other than open market operations, such as changes in reserve requirements or capital controls, to achieve monetary outcomes.|$|E
