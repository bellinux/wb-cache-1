5|$|Yet most American movie theaters, {{especially}} {{outside of}} urban areas, were still not equipped for sound: {{while the number}} of sound cinemas grew from 100 to 800 between 1928 and 1929, they were still vastly outnumbered by silent theaters, which had actually grown in number as well, from 22,204 to 22,544. The studios, in parallel, were still not entirely convinced of the talkies' universal appeal—through mid-1930, the majority of Hollywood movies were produced in dual versions, silent as well as talking. Though few in the industry predicted it, silent film as a viable commercial medium in the United States would soon be little more than a memory. Points West, <b>a</b> <b>Hoot</b> Gibson Western released by Universal Pictures in August 1929, was the last purely silent mainstream feature put out by a major Hollywood studio.|$|E

Biller pointed to the character of Seska as a key narrative device for further exploring the alien species. For Biller, Seska [...] "allowed us to go behind the scenes with the Kazon" [...] and [...] "helped to define the Kazon for us".

Imershein was brought in at the last minute to play Lt. Watley, as she was a friend of one of the production crew and had previously appeared as a Risan pleasure girl in The Next Generation episode [...] "Captain's Holiday". She was brought in because none of the actresses the producers had seen during the casting process could say the role's one line ("Deck 15") convincingly enough. Her involvement led to the role's being expanded into a second scene where she was revealed to be Bashir's great-grandmother.|$|E

She was dressed in military garments and played the electric guitar for the performance. As she sang the song, the backdrops displayed scenes of war and sex which were scrambled to appear {{as if they have}} been shot with a camcorder. Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times described the performance and the video backdrops as being reminiscent of the prisons in Abu Ghraib. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that [...] "it was <b>a</b> <b>hoot</b> to see her [...] strap on an electric guitar and sing classics like 'Burning Up'." [...] Madonna also included a remixed version of the song on the 2015 Rebel Heart Tour. Similar to the Re-Invention World Tour, the singer played the electric guitar during the performance, dressed in a black short nun's outfit.|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today {{felt the}} show benefited from not {{being picked up}} by ABC, where {{it would have been}} in the shadow of Desperate Housewives, and from being {{scheduled}} as summer television, where its competition was weak. Bianco believed that the various storylines were gracefully woven together in the scenes of the episode. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette described the show as a guilty pleasure. Owen stated that although the show was not original for following Desperate Housewives path, it was good summer entertainment that managed to slip in a bit of [...] "social satire". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times panned the show's pilot, describing it as [...] "a silly, hyperactive version of Downton Abbey", although she acknowledged that the episode had elements of The Great Gatsby (the opening murder) and West Side Story (the schoolgirl crush). San Francisco Chronicle critic David Wiegand said [...] "the pilot episode may not break any new ground, but it's energetic and funny". He also noted that [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>hoot</b> the first time we see the maids get the better of their shallow, self-absorbed bosses...", but he felt that this theme might lack the depth to retain audience interest.|$|E

500|$|Rick Porter of Zap2it worried how {{the series}} would fit in [...] "the likes" [...] of Elvis Costello, Mary J. Blige, Sheryl Crow, Clay Aiken and Adam Levine [...] "without it {{overwhelming}} the episode", {{and reported that}} the answer to that [...] "turned out to be 'very effectively.'" [...] In regards to the storylines, itself, he noted that Jack's quest in getting Milton a kidney [...] "balanced nicely" [...] with Liz's story, and that Tracy's [...] "had some good moments". In conclusion, Porter wrote [...] "For a show that doesn't always know how to end episodes, it's done really well at ending seasons." [...] TV Guide Magazine’s Sandra Kofler wrote that the [...] "He Needs a Kidney" [...] song was hilarious, and that it [...] "stole [...] season finale." [...] Patrick Goldstein, a contributor for the Los Angeles Times, was favorable to the musical number, reporting [...] "he song itself is <b>a</b> <b>hoot,</b> highlighted by a wonderful spoken-word kidney donation pitch that begins with Costello saying: 'Listen, when someone starts talking {{in the middle of a}} song, you know it's serious.'" [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett said [...] "Kidney Now!" [...] was [...] "sweet and all", and noted that the [...] "Vontella-as-Tyra spoof" [...] was [...] "brilliant." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik wrote that this episode [...] "was a fitting end for a guest-star-heavy... season of 30 Rock", but added that the finale overall was [...] "maybe average", however, [...] "the ending at least delivered the goods, with the best sitcom celebrity benefit song".|$|E
500|$|Fans of {{the show}} speculated that Dylan would be paired with Nick's ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), to which Case responded by stating, [...] "Everybody’s speculating about Dylan, the new {{character}} coming to town but, all I can say is, I think it’s fun because it’s <b>a</b> <b>hoot</b> to speculate". Luke Kerr of Zap2it noted how fast Dylan met Sharon, and said they could potentially be a [...] "popular pairing with fans". Of working with Case, Burton stated: [...] "Sharon Case is actually very fun, and she makes me laugh. So half the time in scenes where I am laughing, I am really laughing at Sharon! [...] She has that personality where she makes me laugh." [...] He also noted that fans {{of the show}} on Twitter have seen how [...] "comfortable" [...] and [...] "easy" [...] the character's on-screen relationship is. Dylan later shares a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), who was pregnant with Adam Newman's (Michael Muhney) child; she decides to pass the baby off as Dylan's, and the two later marry. Egan described the character's decision to keep the child's paternity a secret as a [...] "ticking time bomb". Burton stated that Dylan is [...] "not the sharpest tool in the shed", since he believed what Chelsea was telling him. When asked about the child, Burton said: [...] "This kid is everything to him, so once we figure out whose it is, if it’s not his, it’s {{not going to be}} a good situation for anybody." [...] When asked if Dylan could forgive Chelsea, Burton added: [...] "That’s a tough one. I don’t know what kind of mental state this is going to put Dylan in, to even think about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Performer Neal Medlyn re-enacted the DVD {{during his}} {{performance}} at the New Museum in April 2008 together with dancers Will Rawls and Erick Montes. His performance was one-hour long and it was titled The Neal Medlyn Experience Live. He sang along to the DVD audio track, complete with word-for-word between-song patter and band introductions. Booth Newspapers' Roger LeLeivre reviewed the re-enactment positively writing, [...] "The event... was <b>a</b> <b>hoot,</b> and the audience loved every second of it. Medlyn has Beyoncé's signature, often spastic, moves down pat, down to each minute hand gesture and facial expression... Unlike a drag show, Medlyn does not try to convince anyone they are seeing Beyoncé. There wasn't {{much in the way}} of costumes (well, he did enter in a black wig, tube top and hot pants, but those bit the dust rather quickly), and why bother?". He concluded that the length of the show was [...] "perfect" [...] as it [...] "ended before the shtick wore out its welcome". LeLeivre finished his review by writing, [...] "It was a delicious pop-culture skewering, right down to the back-up dancers, with their over-the-top moves and expressions... Clearly it enhanced the 'experience,' if you had a passing acquaintance with Beyoncé's songs... but such knowledge was not a prerequisite to enjoying this homage". Claudia La Rocco of The New York Times described his re-enactment as [...] "absurdly faithful" [...] and added that it wouldn't have been nearly as [...] "smart or touching" [...] without the dancing of Rawls and Montes. She further put the performance in her list of the [...] "richest" [...] moments of 2008 and noted, [...] "These astounding performers slipped between genders and among genres, enveloping Mr. Medlyn in utter fabulousness and proving just how sophisticated pop culture can be. Backup dancers everywhere should feel proud." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{northern}} screech-owls {{are found}} in eastern states, such as New Jersey and New York. The screech owls are named for their piercing calls.

They also {{have a kind of}} [...] "song" [...] which is used in courtship and, as a duet, between members of a pair. Calls differ widely between species in type and pitch, and in the field are often the first indication of these birds' presence, as well as the most reliable means to distinguish between species. The distinctness of many species of screech owls was first realized when vastly differing calls of externally similar birds from adjacent regions were noted.|$|E

Ballinger, the genius behind Miranda, is so convincing in the role, you ... will likely forget that there is a normal person behind the red lips".
