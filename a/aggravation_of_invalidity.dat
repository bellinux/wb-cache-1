40|$|It can be {{concluded}} from the Tele 2 judgment of 2016 that i) the declaration <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> <b>of</b> the provisions {{contained in a}} directive inevitably affects the legal act of transposition into the legal order of the Member States, and ii) a Member State cannot resort to the Directive 2002 / 58 to impose a generalised and undifferentiated obligation to conserve traffic and location data following the declaration <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> <b>of</b> Directive 2006 / 24. It is, therefore, urgent to draw conclusions from this recent ruling by the CJEU, which {{is all the more}} relevant because, in Member States where the transposed legislation continued to apply following the declaration <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> <b>of</b> Directive 2006 / 24 – {{as was the case in}} Portugal – many criminal convictions were based on the access to potentially illegitimate data. The authors seek to demonstrate what is happening in Portugal in this area and call for compliance with the jurisprudence of the CJEU – not only because the effectiveness of the European Union law is at stake, but also (and above all), the legal equality between European citizensinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Resumé / Summary This thesis {{deals with}} {{business}} companies, namely {{the stages of}} their existence the understanding of which is essential for their integration into the economical and legal life of the society, more specifically a foundation and an incorporation of a business company and a related question <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> <b>of</b> a company. Business companies are the most frequently chosen institutional form of running business. That is why their legal regulation covers most of the whole {{second part of the}} Commercial Code. The purpose of this thesis is the analysis and explanation of the process of foundation and incorporation of a business company and the closely associated question of acting on behalf of the company before its incorporation, i. e. before it acquires legal personality. This thesis also seeks to clarify the dilemma <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> <b>of</b> business companies. Considering the growing importance of the European law, it is necessary to emphasize the influence of the European law on national legislations, which seems obvious especially in the area <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> <b>of</b> business companies as well as in other mentioned questions. This work is elaborated {{on the basis of the}} valid legal regulations of the Czech Republic, the legislation of the European Union, specialized publications and judicature (national and that of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{population-based}} cross-sectional survey {{assessed the}} prevalence of work-aggravated asthma symptoms {{and the effect of}} the work environment on the <b>aggravation</b> <b>of</b> symptoms of established asthma. A questionnaire was sent to 2, 613 persons (aged 20 – 65 yrs) with asthma. The analyses were restricted to the 969 respondents who were currently employed. The effect of occupational exposure on the <b>aggravation</b> <b>of</b> asthma symptoms at work was assessed according to both self-reported and expert-evaluated exposure. Approximately 21 % of the respondents reported work-aggravated asthma symptoms at least weekly during the past month. The prevalence of those with work-aggravated symptoms increased by age, self-reported occupational exposure to dusts, abnormal temperatures or poor indoor air quality, physically strenuous work, and chemicals, and expert-evaluated probability of daily occupational exposure to airborne dusts, gases or fumes. <b>Aggravation</b> <b>of</b> asthma symptoms at work is common among employed adults with asthma. Both self-reported and expert-evaluated exposure to dusts, abnormal temperatures or poor indoor air quality, physically strenuous work, and chemicals explained the significant worsening of symptoms. The findings suggest a marked role of the work environment in the <b>aggravation</b> <b>of</b> symptoms of established asthma...|$|R

50|$|As to {{the power}} of the court to give {{retrospective}} effect to its order <b>of</b> <b>invalidity,</b> Sachs held that a general declaration <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> with retrospective effect would impact negatively on good government by rendering unlawful all searches conducted after the retrospective date specified. This could create considerable uncertainty regarding the validity of proceedings conducted on the basis of evidence obtained as a result of such searches. It could also give rise to delictual claims by persons subjected to searches and seizures after that date, adding further burdens to a health budget already under considerable strain.|$|R
50|$|The {{court held}} that the {{application}} was in substance an application for direct access. The court had stressed {{on more than one occasion}} that applications for direct access should be granted only in exceptional circumstances. In effect the Minister was asking for an order to suspend the declaration <b>of</b> <b>invalidity.</b> This is an order that should be made, as the Constitution contemplates in section 172(1)(b), by the court making the declaration <b>of</b> <b>invalidity.</b> In this case, the order could have been made by the SCA. It was best placed to determine what was just and equitable in the circumstances.|$|R
50|$|The {{court held}} that the {{declaration}} <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> had to be made retrospective to 27 April 1994, but that it did not apply to any completed transfer of ownership to an heir who had no notice of a challenge to the legal validity of the statutory provisions and the customary-law rule in question. Furthermore, anything done pursuant to the winding-up of an estate in terms of the Act, other than the identification of heirs in a manner inconsistent with this judgment, would not be invalidated by the order <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> in respect <b>of</b> section 23 of the Act and its regulations.|$|R

50|$|Judicial {{review is}} an {{incident}} {{of the separation}} of powers, under which courts regulate and control the exercise of public power by the other branches of government. Before the interim Constitution came into force, in April 1994, the principles of judicial review were developed through the “crucible” of the common law. Since the adoption of the interim Constitution, public power is controlled by the written Constitution, which is the supreme law. The common-law precedent continues to inform the law {{only to the extent that}} it is consistent with the Constitution. Consequently, there is only one system of law. Thus, orders <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> under the courts’ powers of judicial review are orders <b>of</b> constitutional <b>invalidity.</b> If the order <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> relates to conduct of the President, section 172(2) of the Constitution requires that it be confirmed by the Constitutional Court.|$|R
