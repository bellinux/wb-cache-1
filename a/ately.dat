60|$|We good Americans - I say {{it without}} {{presumption}} - are too apt {{to think that}} France is Paris, just as we are accused of being too apt to think that Paris is the celestial city. This {{is by no means}} the case, fortun- <b>ately</b> for those persons who take an interest in modern Gaul, and yet are still left vaguely unsatisfied by that epitome of civilization which stretches from the Arc de Triomphe to the Gymnase theatre. It had already been intimated to the author of these light pages that there are many good things in the doux pays de France of which you get no hint in a walk between those ornaments of the capital; but the truth had been re- vealed only in quick-flashing glimpses, and he was conscious of a desire to look it well in the face. To this end he started, one rainy morning in mid-Septem- ber, for the charming little city of Tours, from which point it seemed possible to make a variety of fruitful excursions. His excursions resolved themselves ulti- mately into a journey through several provinces, - a journey which had its dull moments (as one may defy any journey not to have), but which enabled him to feel that his proposition was demonstrated. France may be Paris, but Paris is not France; that was perfectly evident on the return to the capital.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we prove, {{for the first}} time, that multistability can occur in 3 -dimensional Fillipov type flows due to grazing-sliding bifurcations. We do this by {{reducing}} {{the study of the}} dynamics of Filippov type flows around a grazing-sliding bifurcation to the study of appropri- <b>ately</b> defined one-dimensional maps. In particular, we prove the presence of three qualitatively different types of multiple attractors born in grazing-sliding bifurcations. Namely, a period-two orbit with a sliding segment may coexsist with a chaotic attractor, two stable, period-two and period-three orbits with a segment of sliding each may coexist, or a non-sliding and period-three orbit with two sliding segments may coexist...|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{push and}} pull for data {{collection}} in wireless sensor networks. Most applications to date use the traditional push approach, where nodes transmit sensed data immedi- <b>ately</b> to the sink. Using a pull approach, nodes store the data in their local flash memory, and only engage in commu- nication during dedicated collection phases. We show how one can transform an existing push-based collection protocol into a pull-based one, and compare the power consumption of both approaches on a 35 -node testbed. Our results show that substantial energy gains are possible with pull, provided that the application can tolerate a long latency. Comment: 2 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|Candida albicans is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} human fungal pathogen. Here, we take advantage of haploinsufficiency and transposon mutagenesis to perform large-scale loss-of-function genetic screen in this organism. We identified mutations in 146 genes that affect the switch between its single-cell (yeast) form and filamentous forms of growth; this switch appears central to the virulence of C. albicans. The encoded proteins include those involved in nutrient sensing, signal transduction, transcriptional control, cytoskeletal organization and cell wall construction. Approxim <b>ately</b> one-third of the genes identified in the screen lack homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other model organisms and thus constitute candidate antifungal drug targets. These results illustrate the value of performing forward genetic studies in bona fide pathogens...|$|E

The performance of these mentally disadvantaged' children is compared {{with the performance of}} 200 normally developing children by using a clinical procedure for estimating syntactic development in children's spontaneous speech. The analytical procedure followed is that'presented in Laura Lee's Developmental Sentence Analysis " (1974). At the present time the knowledge concerning dysfunctions of auditory language is based primarily on data from adults who have acquired language and subsequently lost a portion of it. Most of the literature,speculates that mentally disabled children undergo a ',delayed, ' language development and have,a linguistic system that corresponds to younger normal children. Th...|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} and immunologic {{data in a}} case of rheum atoid arthritis complicated by serum hyperviscosity are reported.

The hyperviscosity syndrome in this patient was likely due to the presence of in term ediate complexes and unrelated to the rheu matoid factor activity which was found predom inantly within the IgM fraction of the serum. This case dem onstrates that the hyperviscosity syn drom e may, in rare cases, develop as a complication of rheum atoid arth ri tis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{optimize}} the phase-difference polarization filter for use in extracting short-period regional data from seismic noise and signal coda. The phases to be extracted are the bodywaves Pn, Pg, Sn, and Sg, and the surface waves Lg and Rg. The data available for this work were from events with epicenters in northeastern China, and in Honshu and Hokkaido, Japan. The data used were recorded at the three-component short-period site of the Korean Seismic Research Station (KSRS). The polarization fil-ter yields signal-to-noise ratio gains of approximately 10 dB for regional compressional and shear waves (Pn, Pg, Sn, and Sg) and of approxi <b>ately</b> 8 dB for regional surface waves (Lg and Rg). Direct et imates of 07 e detection capability for regional P and S (= 10 ° to 13) made before and after polar-ization filtering show that the polarization filter yield...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study explores {{feasibility}} of tissue-engineered osteogenesis using sterile coral implants loaded with homologous osteoblasts to repair bone defects. Study Design: A unilateral 4 mm transverse dis- continuity defect was produced approximately mid-way along left radius of young female rabbits using ro- tary diamond disc under continuous saline irrigation and stabilised with autoclaved steel miniplate and screws. The defect was then fitted with sterile bioresorbable coral implant loaded with homologous neonatal calvarial osteoblasts or control implants without osteoblasts. All animals underwent radiography immedi- <b>ately</b> post-operative, at weekly intervals {{for four weeks}} and at fortnightly intervals thereafter. Operated bones were histologically evaluated for osteogenesis at 12 weeks. Results: Findings demonstrate osteogenesis and complete repair of bioresorbable coral implant by homologous osteoblasts loaded on coral scaffold. Conclu- sions: Single stage surgery using this technique to induce osteogenesis and closure of discontinuity bone de- fects including palatal clefts and peripheral reduction of large craniofacial defects might prove better thera- peutic modality than autologous bone grafting or tissue distraction osteogenesis...|$|E
