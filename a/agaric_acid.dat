50|$|<b>Agaric</b> <b>acid</b> {{is used in}} {{medicine}} as an anhidrotic agent {{in order to stop}} excessive perspiration as it paralyses the nerve terminations in the human body's sweat glands. For example, it helps to avoid tuberculosis patients' frequent night sweats. In addition, when taken in doses from 5 to 15 grams, <b>agaric</b> <b>acid</b> produces vomiting in humans. In the past, <b>agaric</b> <b>acid</b> was used as an irritant, an antidiarrhoeal and a bronchial secretions reducer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agaric</b> <b>acid</b> induces the {{mitochondrial}} permeability transition by {{collaborating with}} adenine nucleotide translocase. It facilitates the efflux of accumulated Ca2+, disrupts {{the potential of}} the membrane and causes mitochondrial lumps. All of these effects bet on membrane fluidity. It's thought that <b>agaric</b> <b>acid</b> activates the opening of membrane pores due to the union of citrate to ADP transporters.|$|E
40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright Elsevier [Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]Background: A vast array of substances are marketed as ???legal highs??? in the UK. These products are mainly marketed online and are packaged and produced to mimic illicit drugs. Little is known about the full range of products available at present and no studies have evaluated the product information provided to consumers. Aims & Hypothesis: To describe the available legal high products marketed by UK-based Internet retailers and evaluate the product information provided to consumers. Methods: Websites were identified using the terms ???buy legal highs + UK??? and two search engines. The first 100 hits and a random sample of 5 % of the remaining results were screened. Websites based in the UK were included and all products were entered on a database. Information on product name, list price, claimed effects, side effects, contraindications and interactions was extracted. A descriptive analysis was conducted using SPSS v 14. Results: 115 Websites met the inclusion criteria but due to duplicate listings this was reduced to 39 unique Websites. 1308 products were found and evaluated. The average product price was 9. 69 British pounds. Products took the form of pills (46. 6 %), smoking material (29. 7 %) and single plant material/extract (18. 1 %). Most products claimed to be stimulants (41. 7 %), sedatives (32. 3 %), or hallucinogens (12. 9 %). 40. 1 % of products failed to list ingredients, 91. 9 % failed to list side effects, 81. 9 % failed to list contraindications and 86. 3 % failed to list drug interactions. Top 5 products (with active ingredients in brackets) by frequency were Salvia divinorum (Salivinorin A), Kratom (Mitragynine), Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds (Lysergic <b>Acid</b> Amide), Fly <b>Agaric</b> (Ibotenic <b>Acid,</b> Muscimol) and Genie (JWH 018, CP 47497). Conclusions: Products marketed as ???legal highs??? are easily available from UK-based Internet retailers and are reasonably affordable. Safety information provided to consumers is poor. Uninformed users risk serious adverse effects...|$|R
5000|$|Physicians use <b>agaric</b> <b>acid,</b> but it {{also can}} be used in many other {{subjects}} such as veterinary and biochemistry.In lower animals, this substance depresses the nervous, respiratory and circulatory systems. It {{has been used as a}} metabolic inhibitor at the cellular and subcellular level in scientific animal experiments. <b>Agaric</b> <b>acid</b> has also been used as an alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor in Crithidia fasciculata, which is a species of parasitic protist.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Agaric</b> <b>acid,</b> {{also known}} as agaricin or 2-hydroxynonadecane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid, is an organic tricarboxylic acid (fatty acid) found in fungi, e.g. Laricifomes officinalis. Its {{molecular}} formula is C22H40O7.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Agaric</b> <b>acid</b> {{is a type}} of {{fatty acid}} that is {{composed}} by a long hydrocarbon chain ("tail") and three carboxylic acid groups at one end ("head"). The hydrocarbon chain has sixteen carbons and thirty four hydrogens.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agaric</b> <b>acid</b> {{is used as}} an {{inhibitor}} of metabolism {{in several}} animal experiments. It is shown that this acid prevents the formation of C2 units from citrate and reduces the availability of citrate for the activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase.Moreover, it has {{an important role in}} the metabolism of lipids, because it influences sterol synthesis.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Agaric</b> <b>acid,</b> as {{any other}} fatty acid, has an amphipathic character. It means that it has both polar (hydroxyl groups) and apolar (hydrocarbon chain) sections, and therefore, it is not {{completely}} water-soluble. It is a tribasic acid, and therefore, it can donate up to 3 hydrogen ions to other bases in an acid-base reaction. Another example of tribasic acids is phosphoric acid or citric acid.It is an odorless and tasteless acid, and we can also distinguish it by its white color. Its melting point at atmospheric pressure is 140 Â°C.|$|E
40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} inner membrane {{anion channel}} (IMAC) is a transport pathway which {{is believed to}} be involved in mitochondrial volume homeostasis. The pro-tein, however, has not been identified. In this paper, we examine the relationship between IMAC and the ad-enine nucleotide translocator. Many inhibitors of the ad-enine nucleotide translocase are shown to block IMAC, including Cibacron blue 3 GA, bromcresol green, alizarin red S, <b>agaric</b> <b>acid,</b> palmitoyl-CoA, and the fluorescein derivatives erythrosin B, erythrosin isothiocyanate, rose bengal, and eosin Y. The following evidence sug-gests that Cibacron blue, <b>agaric</b> <b>acid,</b> and palmitoyl-CoA inhibit by binding to a common site. 1) They all only partially block the transport of small anions such as C 1 -, NO,, and HCO,, but completely block the transport of larger anions such as malonate. 2) They decrease the IC, values of each other {{in a manner consistent with}} competitive binding. 3) N-Ethylmaleimide decreases their IC,, values by a similar extent. 4) Inhibition by all shows no dependence on matrix pH and only a small dependence on medium pH. It is suggested that these agents may selectively bind to an open state of IMAC and inhibit by decreasing its conductance. The physi...|$|E
40|$|Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) {{was found}} to be a very potent {{inhibitor}} of purified rabbit liver phosphofructokinase (PFK), giving 50 % inhibition at 0. 2 microM. The inhibition was {{in a manner consistent with}} interaction at the citrate-inhibitory site of the enzyme. The data suggest that inhibition of PFK by ATA was not due to denaturation of the enzyme or the irreversible binding of inhibitor, since the inhibition could be reversed by addition of allosteric activators of PFK, i. e. fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate or AMP. Two other tricarboxylic acids, <b>agaric</b> <b>acid</b> and (-) -hydroxycitrate, were found to inhibit PFK. ATA at much higher concentrations (500 microM) was shown to inhibit fatty acid synthesis from endogenous glycogen in rat hepatocytes; however, protein synthesis was not altered...|$|E

Results : Based on the literary consideration, the following results were obtained: 1. Proteins and polysaccharides of the Class Basidiomycetes activate the host immune system for anti-cancer action without known side-effects, thus it can be given for the prevention and treatment of cancer as a supplement. Phellinus linteus mushroom showed the most significant effects. 2. The Phellinus linteus mushroom is a fungi in the family Hymenochaetaceae and Phellinus, under the class Basidiomycetes. Phellinus linteus can be often found on the trunk of mulberry trees and other latifoliate trees. 3. The characteristics of Phellinus linteus are sweet, neutral in temperature, non-toxic, dissipate the stagnated blood, stop bleeding, invigorate the blood circulation and remove stasis, and nourish qi. It has been used for treating continuous menstrual discharge among the female patients and removing masses in the abdomen to name a few. 4. Phellinus linteus contains <b>agaric</b> <b>acid,</b> fatty acid, C 23 and other numerous enzymes. 5.
