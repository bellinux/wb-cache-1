25|$|When Evelyn Waugh's novel Brideshead Revisited, portraying {{life in the}} English country house, was {{published}} in 1945, its first few chapters offered a glimpse of an exclusive and enviable world, a world of beautiful country houses with magnificent contents, privileged occupants, a profusion of servants and great wealth. Yet, in its final chapters, Brideshead's author accurately documented a changing and fading world, <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> country house {{as a symbol of}} power, privilege and a natural order, was not to exist.|$|E

Describing her as [...] "a major personality in the development" [...] of Wicca, Hutton also expressed the view that [...] "her enduring greatness lay in the very fact that she was so completely and strong-mindedly dedicated to finding and declaring her own truth, in <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> signposts to it were themselves in a state of almost complete confusion".|$|E
500|$|In {{his speeches}} and public writings, Oppenheimer {{continually}} stressed {{the difficulty of}} managing the power of knowledge in <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> freedom of science to exchange ideas was more and more hobbled by political concerns. Oppenheimer delivered the Reith Lectures on the BBC in 1953, which were subsequently published as Science and the Common Understanding. In 1955 Oppenheimer published The Open Mind, a collection of eight lectures that he had given since 1946 {{on the subject of}} nuclear weapons and popular culture. Oppenheimer rejected the idea of nuclear gunboat diplomacy. [...] "The purposes of this country in the field of foreign policy", he wrote, [...] "cannot in any real or enduring way be achieved by coercion". In 1957 the philosophy and psychology departments at Harvard invited Oppenheimer to deliver the William James Lectures. An influential group of Harvard alumni led by Edwin Ginn that included Archibald Roosevelt protested against the decision. Some 1,200 people packed into Sanders Theatre to hear Oppenheimer's six lectures, entitled [...] "The Hope of Order". Oppenheimer delivered the Whidden Lectures at McMaster University in 1962, and these were published in 1964 as The Flying Trapeze: Three Crises for Physicists.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the book}} Superhero: The Secret Origin of a Genre, Peter Coogan writes that Doom's {{original}} appearance was {{representative of a}} change in the portrayal of [...] "mad scientists" [...] to full-fledged villains, often with upgraded powers.

Sanderson also found traces of William Shakespeare’s characters Richard III and Iago in Doom; all of them [...] "are descended from the 'vice' figure of medieval drama", who address the audience in monologues detailing their thoughts and ambitions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} was ranked 4th on IGN's {{list of the}} Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time and as the 8th Greatest Villain by Wizard on its 100 Greatest Villains of All Time list.

Scott James Wells, Sherman Howard, John Shea, and Michael Rosenbaum portrayed the character in Superman-themed television series, while Lyle Talbot, Gene Hackman, Kevin Spacey, and Jesse Eisenberg have portrayed the character in major motion pictures. Clancy Brown, Powers Boothe, James Marsters, Chris Noth, Anthony LaPaglia, Steven Blum, Fred Tatasciore, Jason Isaacs, Kevin Michael Richardson, Mark Rolston, John DiMaggio, James Woods, and others have provided the character's voice in animation adaptations.|$|E
2500|$|Writing in The Guardian on 18 October, Powell {{asserted}} {{that due to}} the Falklands War, [...] "Britain no longer looked upon itself and the world through American spectacles" [...] and the view was [...] "more rational; and it was more congenial; for, after all, it was our own view". He quoted an observation that Americans thought their country was [...] "a unique society... where God has put together all nationalities, races and interests of the globe for one purpose-–to show {{the rest of the}} world how to live". He denounced the [...] "manic exaltation of the American illusion" [...] and compared it to the [...] "American nightmare". Powell also disliked the American belief that [...] "they are authorised, possibly by the deity, to intervene, openly or covertly, in the internal affairs of other countries anywhere in the world". Britain should dissociate herself from American intervention in the Lebanon: [...] "It is not in Britain's self-interest alone that Britain should once again assert her own position. <b>A</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> American myth and the American nightmare go unchallenged by question or by contradiction is not a world as safe or as peaceable as human reason, prudence and realism can make it".|$|E

[...] In 1967, Lou Reed famously wrote, [...] "Will none of the powers that be realize what Brian Wilson did with the chords?" [...] Pitchfork Media posited, [...] "At some point, you learn that the Beach Boys weren't just a fun 1960s surf band with a run of singles that later came to be used in commercials; at their best, they were making capital-A Art. … Once you've absorbed [...] , you find yourself going back through songs like [...] "Don't Worry Baby", [...] "The Warmth of the Sun", and [...] "I Get Around", finding a deeper brilliance where you once heard only pop craftsmanship." [...] Discussing the 2011 release of The Smile Sessions, The Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "certainly every library of American recording history needs this; university composition departments, music professors, budding recording engineers and composers should study it." ...|$|E

2500|$|VA-11 HALL-A is also partly {{inspired}} by Snatcher and Policenauts. The game's music has vaporwave influences, {{as well as}} influences from Kenji Kawai's work. Ortiz described VA-11 HALL-As composer Michael Kelly as [...] "a big, BIG Shin Megami Tensei fan." [...] The game's developers grew up playing PlayStation and Super Famicom games as well as watching anime; VA-11 HALL-A tries to [...] "make players feel what we felt when playing our favourite titles back then", says Ortiz. Fernando Damas, writer and programmer of VA-11 HALL-A, added {{in an interview that}} the game tries to make the player [...] "feel small", and rather than guiding them through the basics of the plotline, the player is instead thrown into the middle of everything and only given the means of piecing together what is going on. He also remarked how the game is set in an [...] "ever-moving world" [...] where things do not wait for the player to happen, with the characters existing long before the player meeting them and their lives happen mostly off-screen. As such, the developers hoped to create <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> player is compelled, rather than obligated, to understand. Details of the world are not given directly to the player, and instead are revealed through intimate exchanges and conversations with the characters. Thus, according Ortiz and Damas, VA-11 HALLAs setting therefore seeks to [...] "humaniz cyberpunk/sci-fi".|$|E
