Agglomeration is defined using geographical concentration while strategic groups are measured as incubated firms that belong to the industry most highly represented within an incubator.

Similarly, incubated firms that belong to a strategic group have a lower hazard of exit. However, the combined effects of agglomeration <b>and</b> strategic <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> based on a three-way interaction between incubation, agglomeration, <b>and</b> strategic <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> leads to an increased hazard of exit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} data association in a multi-person tracking context. In semi-crowded environments, people are still discernible as individually moving entities, that undergo many interac-tions with other people in their direct surrounding. Finding the correct association is therefore difficult, but higher-order social factors, such as <b>group</b> <b>membership,</b> are expected to ease the problem. However, estimat-ing <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> is a chicken-and-egg problem: knowing pedestrian trajectories, it is rather easy to find out possible groupings in the data, but in crowded scenes, {{it is often difficult}} to estimate closely interacting trajectories without further knowledge about groups. To this end, we propose a third-order graphical model that is able to jointly estimate correct trajectories <b>and</b> <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> over a short time window. A set of experiments on challenging data underline the importance of joint reasoning for data association in crowded scenarios...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there are}} some variations, the {{traditional}} minimal group study consists of two phases. In the first phase, participants are randomly and anonymously {{divided into two groups}} (e.g., [...] "Group A" [...] and [...] "Group B"), ostensibly on the basis of trivial criteria (e.g., preference for paintings or the toss of a coin). Sometimes, these participants are strangers to one another. In the second phase, participants take part in an ostensibly unrelated resource distribution task. During this task, participants distribute a valuable resource (e.g., money or points) between other participants who are only identified by code number <b>and</b> <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> (e.g., [...] "participant number 34 of Group A"). Participants are told that, after the task is finished, they will receive the total amount of the resource that has been allocated to them by the other participants.|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} usage {{scenario}} involving a web service that employs WS-Trust, when a client requests {{access to an}} application, the application does not authenticate the client directly (for instance, by validating the client's login credentials against an internal database). Instead, the application redirects the client to a security token service, which in turn authenticates the client and grants it a security token. The token consists {{of a set of}} XML data records that include multiple elements regarding the identity <b>and</b> <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> of the client, as well as information regarding the lifetime of the token and the issuer of the token. The token is protected from manipulation with strong cryptography. The client then presents the token to an application {{to gain access to the}} resources provided by the application. This process is illustrated in the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) use case, demonstrating how single sign-on can be used to access web services.|$|E
50|$|The {{social group}} is a {{critical}} {{source of information about}} individual identity. An individual’s identity (or self-concept) has two components: personal identity and social identity (or collective self). One’s personal identity is defined by more idiosyncratic, individual qualities and attributes. In contrast, one’s social identity is defined by his or her group membership, and the general characteristics (or prototypes) that define the group and differentiate it from others. We naturally make comparisons between our own group and other groups, but we do not necessarily make objective comparisons. Instead, we make evaluations that are self-enhancing, emphasizing the positive qualities of our own group (see ingroup bias). In this way, these comparisons give us a distinct and valued social identity that benefits our self-esteem. Our social identity <b>and</b> <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> also satisfies a need to belong. Of course, individuals belong to multiple groups. Therefore, one’s social identity can have several, qualitatively distinct parts (for example, one’s ethnic identity, religious identity, and political identity).|$|E

50|$|A {{sense of}} belongingness {{increases}} a person’s willingness to assist {{others in the}} group by the group rules. Belongingness <b>and</b> <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> encourages social groups with motivation to comply, cooperate, and help. Cohesive work groups show more consideration, report positive relationships within the group and elicits more organizational citizenship behaviors. Also, an already cohesive and collective group will make people more inclined {{to comply with the}} rules of the workplace. Some people help each other in return for a future expected favor; however, most workings help because it is the “right” thing to do or because they like their leaders so much and wish to express this likeness. People are more receptive to a leader who provides a clear sense of direction and inspiration with the promise of a better future. Workers who feel more isolated in the workplace feel the need to belong even more than those who are not isolated because they are missing that collective feeling of unity. A workplace functions better as a collective whole.|$|E

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} points to the value of multiple <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> for individual well-being. However, much of this work considers <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> very broadly <b>and</b> in terms of number alone. We conducted two correlational studies exploring how the relationship between multiple <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> well-being is shaped by (a) the complexity of those groups within the overall self-concept (i. e., social identity complexity: SIC), and (b) the perceived value and visibility of individual <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> to others (i. e., stigma). Study 1 (N = 112) found a positive relationship between multiple <b>group</b> <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> well-being, but only for individuals high in SIC. This effect was mediated by perceived identity expression and access to social support. Study 2 (N = 104) also found that multiple <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> indirectly contributed to well-being via perceived identity expression and social support, as well as identity compatibility and perceived social inclusion. But, in this study the relationship between multiple <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> <b>and</b> well-being outcomes was moderated by the perceived value <b>and</b> visibility of <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> to others. Specifically, possessing multiple, devalued <b>and</b> visible <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> compromised well-being relative to multiple valued <b>group</b> <b>memberships,</b> or devalued <b>group</b> <b>memberships</b> that were invisible.
