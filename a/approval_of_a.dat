5|$|An east–west freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing traffic to access downtown Lansing in the 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal {{for what would}} become the Interstate Highway System. As originally proposed by the Michigan State Highway Department in 1958, the freeway was to be called I-296. The department was waiting on <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> final numbering scheme the next year, before the first Interstates were signed in the state in 1959. By the time construction started on the Lansing freeway, it was numbered I-496.|$|E

2500|$|The fourth {{exemption}} is for any assessment which previously received majority voter {{approval from}} the voters voting in an election {{on the issue of}} the assessment.

[...] Technically, to qualify for the exemption the election had to be legally binding and not advisory in nature.

Bank regulators refused to approve the sale of Lincoln. Glenn too continued to help Keating after the April 1987 revelation, by setting up a meeting with then-House Majority Leader Jim Wright.|$|E
5|$|In 1785, a {{proposal}} {{for the creation of}} a General Assembly went before the Synod, yet the convening of one was delayed due to the necessity of having to write a constitution, a constitution which officers could not initially agree upon. In 1788, the Synod adopted a constitution modeled on the Church of Scotland in which power was centralized in the General Assembly. The constitution also included provisions of the Church of Scotland's Barrier Act of 1697, which required the General Assembly to receive the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> majority of presbyteries before making major changes to the church's constitution and doctrine.|$|E

5|$|The 1925 General Assembly {{faced the}} threat of schism over {{the actions of the}} Presbytery of New York. Attempting to deescalate the situation, General Assembly {{moderator}} Charles Erdman proposed the creation of a special commission to study the church's problems and find solutions. The commission's report, released in 1926, sought to find a moderate approach to solving the church's theological conflict. In agreement with the Auburn Affirmation, the commission concluded that doctrinal pronouncements issued by the General Assembly were not binding without the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> majority of the presbyteries. In a defeat for conservatives, the report was adopted by the General Assembly. Conservatives were further disenchanted in 1929 when the General Assembly approved the ordination of women as lay elders.|$|E

This included the London House and Normandy House apartment complexes. Although it also proposed constructing two apartment complexes {{in the center of the}} area, three office buildings were built instead. London House opened in January 1965.|$|E
5|$|The first {{legislative}} session of Breathitt's administration {{was a disappointment}} to his faction. His youth and narrow margin of victory in the election undermined his authority. Further, the unexpected death of Richard P. Moloney, a key legislative leader, was a blow to Breathitt's ability to push his agenda through the General Assembly. The major accomplishment of the 1964 session was the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> $176million bond issue to increased funding for roads, public education, the state park system, and social services. Other minor accomplishments included passing a purchasing law, strengthening strip mining regulations, and improving benefits for teachers.|$|E

5|$|As governor, Carroll {{increased}} funding {{for public education}} and promoted the use of coal {{as a means of}} alleviating the 1973 energy crisis. He also oversaw a major reorganization of the state's judicial system following voters' <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> constitutional amendment in 1975. Many natural and man-made disasters occurred during his term in office, including the Great Blizzard of 1978 and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire, leading to better safety practices and stricter law enforcement in the state. When Carroll left office, both he and his predecessor were under the cloud of an investigation for an alleged insurance kickback scheme, but Carroll was not convicted of any wrongdoing. In 2004, {{he was elected to the}} Kentucky Senate. Re-elected in 2008 and 2012, he won a fourth term without opposition in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Belgium gained its {{independence}} from the United Netherlands in 1830 and was established as a popular and constitutional monarchy under a bicameral parliamentary democracy. A liberal Constitution was written in 1831 which codified the responsibilities and restrictions imposed on the monarch. Although the King, as head of state, was prevented from acting without the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> government minister, he was allowed full control of military matters {{in his capacity as}} Commander-in-Chief. Which responsibility would take precedence if they became incompatible was left ambiguous and this uncertainty would {{lie at the heart of}} the Royal Question. The first king, Leopold I, accepted the terms of the Constitution but attempted to use its ambiguities to subtly increase his own powers. This was continued by his successors, although with little real success.|$|E
5|$|Calling a {{constitutional}} convention required the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{majority of voters}} in two successive elections or a two-thirds majority of both houses of the General Assembly. In February 1797, the General Assembly voted to put the question before the electorate in the upcoming May elections. Of the 9,814 votes cast, 5,446 favored the call and 440 opposed it, but 3,928 had not voted at all, and several counties recorded no votes on the issue either way. This cast doubt {{in the minds of}} many legislators regarding the true will of the people. Opponents of the convention claimed that the abstentions should be counted as votes against the call; this position had some merit, as it was well known that many Fayette County voters had abstained as a protest against the convention. When all of the irregularities were accounted for, the General Assembly determined that the vote had fallen short of the required majority.|$|E

Combs {{combined}} the bond issue with $10million in revenue bonds and effected major renovations at all 26 of the state's parks. Though his dreams of seeing privately owned tourist facilities spring up around the parks {{did not come to}} fruition, out-of-state tourism to Kentucky more than doubled during his administration, accounting for about sixty percent of state park visitors and fifty-three percent of the overnight visitations to the parks. Journalist John Ed Pearce recounts that Kentucky natives began to complain that they could not get reservations in the parks during peak seasons and called for limitations on the number of out-of-state visitors or a reservation system that favored Kentuckians, although nothing was done to address these complaints.|$|E
5|$|Desiring to {{care for}} his sick wife and rebuild his {{personal}} wealth, Breckinridge returned to his law practice in Lexington. In addition to his legal practice, he engaged in land speculation in Minnesota and Wisconsin territories. When Governor Willis A. Gorman of the Minnesota Territory thwarted an attempt by Breckinridge's fellow investors (not including Breckinridge) to secure <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> railroad connecting Dubuque, Iowa, with their investments near Superior, Wisconsin, they petitioned Pierce to remove Gorman and appoint Breckinridge in his place. In 1855, Pierce authorized two successive investigations of Gorman, but failed to uncover any wrongdoing that would justify his removal. During his time away from politics, Breckinridge also promoted the advancement of horse racing in his native state and was chosen president of the Kentucky Association for the Improvement of the Breed of Horses.|$|E
5|$|Ferry {{implementation}} required {{permission from}} several entities. Before the ferry could start service, the NYCDOT {{was required to}} approve a new transportation mode within its service area. Additionally, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and United States Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) was supposed to give NYC Ferry permission to use of the landings, with the United States Coast Guard advising the CoE's <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> permit as well as monitoring the design of vessels. In addition, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation had to allow ferries to use the landing at Gantry Plaza State Park, and the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation was consulted so they could give permission for the Roosevelt Island landing to be built. By September 2016, the Gantry Plaza landing had been approved.|$|E
