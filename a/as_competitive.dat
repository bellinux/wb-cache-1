5|$|Numerous senior central {{bankers and}} finance ministers issued public warnings, the first being Alexei Ulyukayev, the first deputy {{chairman}} at Russia's central bank. He was later joined by many others including Park Jae-wan, the finance minister for South Korea, and by Jens Weidmann, {{president of the}} Bundesbank. Weidmann held the view that interventions during the 2009–11 period were not intense enough to count <b>as</b> <b>competitive</b> devaluation, but that a genuine currency war is now a real possibility. Japan's economy minister Akira Amari {{has said that the}} Bank of Japan's bond buying programme is intended to combat deflation, and not to weaken the yen.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} levels of {{advanced}} schooling. The first was the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, which concentrated on teaching officers both command and staff duties related to corps and divisions. Although viewed <b>as</b> <b>competitive,</b> nearly all officers eventually attended. A 1937 survey showed that 97 percent of the Army's colonels and 95 percent of its lieutenant colonels were graduates. There were two senior schools, the Army War College and the Army Industrial College. The Army War College taught the handling of higher formations. The Army Industrial College taught industrial mobilization.|$|E

5|$|Currency war, {{also known}} <b>as</b> <b>competitive</b> devaluations, is a {{condition}} in international affairs where countries seek to gain a trade advantage over other countries by causing the exchange rate of their currency to fall {{in relation to other}} currencies. As the exchange rate of a country's currency falls exports become more competitive in other countries, and imports into the country become more expensive. Both effects benefit the domestic industry, and thus employment, which receives a boost in demand from both domestic and foreign markets. However, the price increases for import goods (as well as in the cost of foreign travel) are unpopular as they harm citizens' purchasing power; and when all countries adopt a similar strategy, it can lead to a general decline in international trade, harming all countries.|$|E
5|$|The Super Smash Bros. {{series has}} been widely played <b>as</b> <b>competitive</b> video games and has been {{featured}} in several high-profile tournaments. The first publicized Super Smash Bros. Melee tournaments were held in early 2002. From 2004 to 2007, Melee was on Major League Gaming's tournament roster. In 2010 MLG picked up Brawl for its pro circuit for a year. During this time, Nintendo prohibited MLG from live streaming Brawl matches. At 2014 MLG Anaheim Melee was once again hosted at an MLG event. Melee was also included at the Evolution Championship Series (Evo) in 2007, a fighting game tournament held in Las Vegas. Melee was again hosted at Evo 2013 after it won a charity drive to decide the final game to be featured in its tournament lineup. Due to the large turnout and popularity that year, Evo again included a Melee at their 2014 event and plans {{to do so in}} 2015. New Jersey based Apex is another prominent Super Smash Bros. tournament, and has a series of qualifying events that are a prerequisite to playing at Apex. In 2015 Apex announced that they were officially sponsored by Nintendo of America. EVO 2015 was the largest Smash tournament in history and featured Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Melee with the former having 1,926 entrants and the latter having 1,869.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{differences in}} the stereotype content of immigrant groups between linguistic regions. We expected that immigrant groups who speak the local language of a specific linguistic region would be perceived <b>as</b> more <b>competitive</b> within this region than in another linguistic region. Further, we expected these differences would underlie regional differences in stereotype content, albeit only for the warmth dimension. Predictions were tested in the two largest linguistic regions of Switzerland. As expected, in the German-speaking region, locals perceived German immigrants <b>as</b> more <b>competitive</b> and thus <b>as</b> less warm, whereas in the French-speaking region, locals perceived French immigrants <b>as</b> more <b>competitive</b> and, consequently, <b>as</b> less warm. So, paradoxically, immigrants with strong integration potential are particularly disliked because they are regarded as direct competitors...|$|R
