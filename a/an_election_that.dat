5|$|By 1972, Diefenbaker {{had grown}} disillusioned with Trudeau, and campaigned wholeheartedly for the Tories in that year's election. Diefenbaker was reelected comfortably {{in his home}} riding, and the Progressive Conservatives came within two seats of {{matching}} the Liberal total. Diefenbaker was relieved both that Trudeau had been humbled and that Stanfield had been denied power. Trudeau regained his majority two years later in <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>that</b> saw Diefenbaker, by then the only living former Prime Minister, have his personal majority grow to 11,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} 2008 and 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, Kilroy was {{involved}} in close elections for Ohio's 15th congressional district. She lost in 2006 after <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>that</b> required the counting of absentee ballots and election recounts. However, after the incumbent retired, she won a similarly close election in 2008. In both cases, she was behind after the Election Day vote tabulations, but made up significant ground with belated absentee ballot voting results. The 2010 election race was widely followed in the mainstream press as a race that the Republicans were targeting.|$|E
5|$|The council met on December 14 {{to appoint}} representatives to the Confederacy's unicameral {{provisional}} congress. Those appointed would serve {{for only two}} months, as the provisional congress was replaced with a permanent bicameral legislature on February 17, 1862. Kentucky was entitled to two senators and 12 representatives in the permanent Confederate Congress. The usual day for general elections being passed, Governor Johnson and the legislative council set election day for Confederate Kentucky on January 22. Voters were allowed to vote in whichever county they occupied on election day, and could cast a general ballot for all positions. In <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>that</b> saw military votes outnumber civilian ones, only four of the provisional legislators were elected to seats in the Confederate House of Representatives. One provisional legislator, Henry Burnett, {{was elected to the}} Confederate Senate.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, the {{legislature}} passed the Aldrich Act; {{combined with the}} approval of the Bond Issue Act during <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>that</b> April, the MSHD was authorized to assume responsibility over the roadways that composed the State Trunkline Highway System. The state highway commissioner was required to sign the state trunkline highways, and Michigan become the second state after Wisconsin to do so. Alan Williams, Ionia County engineer, helped to design the diamond marker used to sign the highways; he is also known for placing a picnic table alongside US16 (Grand River Avenue) in 1929 south of Saranac, considered the first in the country. Other sources say that the first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert Larson near what is now US2 near Iron River in 1919–20. The first crows nest traffic tower in the US was installed at the intersection of Woodward and Michigan avenues in Detroit on October 9, 1917. The tower elevated a police officer above the center of the intersection to direct traffic before it was replaced in October 1920 with the world's first four-way traffic light.|$|E

25|$|At the end, {{the ruling}} parties were {{declared}} winners of <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>that</b> most observers saw as rigged {{in favour of}} the incumbent. This election was indeed the beginning of violent electioneering {{in the annals of}} Nigerian history. There were wanton killings and arson was rampant. It became hazardous to walk the streets in broad daylight. This was a perfect setting for the 15 January 1966 coup that imposed martial law and thereby restored public order.|$|E
25|$|In 1807, {{a famous}} duel {{took place at}} Ardcandrisk between John Colclough and William Alcock. The main cause was <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>that</b> {{was about to be}} held – each being {{opposing}} candidates. Colclough was killed and a huge crowd subsequently attended his funeral at Tintern Abbey. This was mainly because the Colcloughs were generally popular and considered liberal landlords and also because Colclough was the people's candidate. The Colclough family had been granted the former Abbey (part of which they used as a dwelling) and its extensive lands in the mid-16th century.|$|E
25|$|Niger has {{had four}} republican constitutions since {{independence}} in 1960, but {{four of its}} seven presidents have been military leaders, taking power in three coups. The first presidential elections took place in 1993 (33 years after independence), and the first municipal elections only took place in 2007. The 1999 constitution followed the coup against and murder of President Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara by fellow military leaders. Prior to the 1992 uprising that led to free elections, Nigeriens have had little say in their nation's governance. In 2004 Mamadou Tandja was elected to his second five-year presidential term in <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>that</b> international observers deemed generally free and fair.|$|E

25|$|McAleese's initial {{seven-year term}} of office ended in November 2004, but she had {{announced}} on 14 September that she would stand {{for a second term}} in the 2004 presidential election. Following the failure of any other candidate to secure the necessary support for nomination, the incumbent president stood unopposed, with no political party affiliation, and was declared elected on 1 October. She was re-inaugurated at the commencement of her second seven-year term on 11 November. McAleese's very high approval ratings were widely seen as the reason for her re-election, with no opposition party willing to bear the cost (financial or political) of competing in <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>that</b> would prove difficult to win.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before the}} non-partisan primary campaign, Combs complained that Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert F. Stephens' plan to convene {{the court in}} Ashland, Pikeville and Hazard – the three most populous cities in the 7th District, which Combs, Stephenson, and a third {{candidate}} were vying to represent on the court – amounted to a political ploy meant to convey Stephens' endorsement of the incumbent. Stephens denied any political motive, saying the trip {{was part of a}} public education campaign that began in 1986 with trips to Louisville, Owensboro, and Paducah. In <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>that</b> saw a record-low 15% turnout, Stephenson finished about 2,000 votes ahead of Combs in the primary, and both men finished well ahead of the third candidate in the race, who was eliminated from the general election ballot with the loss.|$|E
25|$|Curtin {{stood for}} Parliament {{a second time}} in 1925, this time for Fremantle, {{although}} he lost heavily to the incumbent William Watson. Watson retired in 1928, and Curtin ran again, this time winning on the second count. Re-elected in Labor's sweeping election victory the following year, he expected to be named {{as a member of}} Prime Minister James Scullin's Cabinet, but disapproval of his heavy drinking habit meant that he remained on the backbench. William Watson chose to briefly come out of retirement in 1931, and easily defeated Curtin in <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>that</b> saw Labor collapse to just 14 seats in Parliament. After the loss, Curtin became the advocate for the Western Australian Government with the Commonwealth Grants Commission. He stood for his old seat in 1934 after Watson announced his retirement for the second time, and was able to win it back.|$|E

25|$|The Fascists {{began their}} attempt to entrench Fascism in Italy with the Acerbo Law, which {{guaranteed}} a plurality of the seats in parliament to any party or coalition list in <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>that</b> received 25% {{or more of the}} vote. Through considerable Fascist violence and intimidation, the list won a majority of the vote, allowing many seats to go to the Fascists. In the aftermath of the election, a crisis and political scandal erupted after Socialist Party deputy Giacomo Matteotti was kidnapped and murdered by a Fascist. The liberals and the leftist minority in parliament walked out in protest in {{what became known as the}} Aventine Secession. On 3 January 1925, Mussolini addressed the Fascist-dominated Italian parliament and declared that he was personally responsible for what happened, but insisted that he had done nothing wrong. Mussolini proclaimed himself dictator of Italy, assuming full responsibility over the government and announcing the dismissal of parliament. From 1925 to 1929, Fascism steadily became entrenched in power: opposition deputies were denied access to parliament, censorship was introduced and a December 1925 decree made Mussolini solely responsible to the King.|$|E

The move was backed by Fine Gael's backbench TDs at a meeting on 7 April, but rejected by Fianna Fáil. McEntee described the proposal as [...] "an historic offer, representing seismic change in the political landscape". She also participated in an internal party inquiry into Fine Gael's poor election performance, {{as part of a}} team of TDs who spoke to unsuccessful candidates, but stood down from this position upon her appointment as a junior minister.|$|E

500|$|In 1994, Rice {{was elected}} to the Glendale, Colorado city council, running on a {{platform}} of shifting the small Denver enclave's business base away from adult-oriented businesses and towards a more [...] "resident-family community." [...] He was elected mayor in 1996. During his first term, Rice proposed new regulations on erotic dancers at Glendale nightclubs, garnering strong opposition from local business owners, who formed the [...] "Glendale Tea Party" [...] and elected three members to the city council in 1998 in response to the new regulations. Running for re-election, Rice faced opposition from Tea Party member Mike Dunafon, who promoted accusations that Rice used racial slurs and denigrated African-American and Mexican citizens. Rice was also criticized for being absent from Glendale during six months of his term as mayor, while he attended the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. However, after <b>an</b> <b>election</b> <b>that</b> saw record campaign spending and record turnout for Glendale, Rice defeated Dunafon and was re-elected to a second term in 2000.|$|E
