5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of {{internal transcribed spacer}} DNA sequences shows that C.vinicolor groups in a clade with the closely related C.jamaicensis and C.pseudovinicolor. All of these species feature darkly-amyloid flesh and thick-walled cystidia. Based on this analysis, Miller considered C.jamaicensis to be insufficiently distinct genetically from C.vinicolor to warrant designation as a separate species; however, as of 2012, both MycoBank <b>and</b> <b>Index</b> Fungorum list it as a valid species.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into 27 chapters, with a prelude, coda, {{bibliography}} <b>and</b> <b>index.</b> Each chapter deals with a new topic, such as the potential fates of plastics, petroleum infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and artworks.

There is no unifying narrative, cohesive single-chapter overview, or thesis.|$|E

5|$|The {{holding up}} {{of one hand}} with middle <b>and</b> <b>index</b> fingers crossed was the usual gesture found in New Zealand in 1999–2001. The T-shape was also used when saying {{time-out}}. The time-out gesture is made with two hands - one hand held horizontally, palm down, the other hand vertically with the fingertips touching {{the bottom of the}} horizontal hand. In the US, although the more modern time-out has largely supplanted traditional terms, often accompanied by the time-out gesture, the crossed fingers gesture remains common.|$|E

Yuji Himukai, known for his work on the Etrian Odyssey series, worked as character designer and illustrator on the 2011 game, creating new art for returning characters. The series received a wide range of reviews, from negative to positive. Reviewers enjoyed the demon fusion, while the music and visuals were criticized.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} by School Library Journal, Smith's {{encyclopedia}} was praised for its reference value. The review called the encyclopedia comprehensive, and noted it contained helpful appendices including a glossary, lists of executive staff {{members of the}} CIA, and a large bibliography <b>and</b> <b>index.</b> Booklist commented in its review that the encyclopedia was a good resource to have in libraries at the academic, public, and high school levels. Publishers Weekly reviewed the encyclopedia and criticized Smith's objectivity, suggesting that he took an unabashedly positive view of the agency's role and focused exclusively on its operational successes. Despite the issue with bias, the review concluded that the book was still a useful reference work.|$|E

5|$|Invalided out {{of service}} in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due {{to the extent of}} the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed {{stockbroking}} during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> finger of his (dominant) right hand.|$|E
5|$|Summerhill: A Radical Approach to Child Rearing {{was written}} by A. S. Neill and {{published}} by Hart Publishing Company in 1960. In a letter to Neill, New York publisher Harold Hart suggested a book specific for America devised of parts from four of Neill's previous works: The Problem Child, The Problem Parent, The Free Child, and That Dreadful School. Neill liked his idea and gave the publisher wide liberties in the manuscript's preparation, preferring to write a preface or appendix in reflection on the writings. In rereading his work, he realized he disagreed with his earlier statements on Freudian child analysis. Neill later regretted the liberties he afforded the publisher, particularly his removal of Wilheim Reich's name from the book <b>and</b> <b>index,</b> since Neill saw Reich as an influential figure. They also struggled over issues of copyrights. Neill did not contest his disagreements, as {{he was eager to}} see the book published.|$|E
5|$|The claw {{of a bird}} of prey; {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey {{would not be able}} to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people. All birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The hoatzin and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> finger (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end of the hand digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1853. The type collection {{was made by}} American botanist Henry William Ravenel in South Carolina. Joseph Ammirati and Howard Bigelow considered Cortinarius heliotropicus, described by Charles Horton Peck 1914, {{to be the same}} species as C.iodes after examining the holotype specimens of both. According to the nomenclatural databases MycoBank <b>and</b> <b>Index</b> Fungorum, however, Cortinarius iodes does not have any synonyms. If they are indeed the same species, the name C.iodes has priority. C.iodes is classified in the subgenus Myxacium, along with other Cortinarius species that have a slimy cap and stem.|$|E
5|$|Several taxa {{have been}} named as {{belonging}} to the genus Sarcosphaera over the years, but most lack modern descriptions and have not been reported since their original collections. For example, Sarcosphaera funerata was renamed by Fred Jay Seaver in 1930 based on the basionym Peziza funerata, originally described by Cooke in 1878. Sarcosphaera gigantea was a species collected from Michigan, originally described as Pustularia gigantea by Heinrich Rehm in 1905, and considered distinct from S.coronaria {{on the basis of}} its smaller spore size. Sarcosphaera ulbrichiana was described by Wilhem Kirschstein in 1943. Other taxa have been reduced to synonymy with S.coronaria, or transferred to other genera. Sarcosphaera eximia (originally Peziza eximia Durieu & Lév. 1848, and later transferred to Sarcosphaera by René Maire), Sarcosphaera crassa (considered by Zdeněk Pouzar in a 1972 publication to be the correct name for S.coronaria) and Sarcosphaera dargelasii (originally Peziza dargelasii Gachet 1829, transferred to Sarcosphaera by Nannfeldt) are now considered synonyms of S.coronaria. Sarcosphaera ammophila (originally Peziza ammophila Durieu & Mont.) and Sarcosphaera amplissima (originally Peziza amplissima Fr. 1849) have since been transferred back to Peziza. The 10th edition of the Dictionary of the Fungi (2008) considers Sarcosphaera to be monotypic, <b>and</b> <b>Index</b> Fungorum has only Sarcosphaera coronaria confirmed as valid.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop exact {{relationships}} between empirical Fisher <b>indexes</b> <b>and</b> their theoretical Malmquist and Konus counterparts. We begin by using implicit Malmquist price <b>and</b> price recovery <b>indexes</b> to establish exact relationships between Malmquist quantity <b>and</b> productivity <b>indexes</b> <b>and</b> Fisher quantity <b>and</b> productivity <b>indexes.</b> We then show that Malmquist quantity <b>and</b> productivity <b>indexes</b> <b>and</b> Fisher price <b>and</b> price recovery <b>indexes</b> “almost” satisfy the product test with the relevant value change, and we derive a quantity mix function that ensures {{satisfaction of the}} product test. We next use implicit Konus quantity <b>and</b> productivity <b>indexes</b> to establish exact relationships between Konus price <b>and</b> price recovery <b>indexes</b> <b>and</b> Fisher price <b>and</b> price recovery <b>indexes.</b> We then show that Konus price <b>and</b> price recovery <b>indexes</b> <b>and</b> Fisher quantity <b>and</b> productivity <b>indexes</b> “almost” satisfy the product test with the relevant value change, we derive a price mix function that ensures satisfaction of the product test, and we show that this price mix function differs fundamentally from the quantity mix function relating Malmquist <b>and</b> Fisher <b>indexes...</b>|$|R
