5|$|The {{ability to}} study prehistoric art is {{dependent}} on surviving artifacts.

Whether all these artifacts can be defined as works of art is contested between scholars. Alexander Marshack argued that the earliest, non-representational incisions on rock mark the beginnings of human art. More cautiously, Paul Mellars suggests that the relative rarity of these works means they cannot be seen as integral to early human society and evidence of an artistic culture.|$|E

This Article reports {{the findings of the}} first comprehensive study of the variables that determine whether a business will succeed or fail. Eleven conditions best predict companies' survival prospects. First, a company that even hints in the press release announcing its bankruptcy that it intends to sell its business is highly <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Second, reorganizations assigned to <b>more</b> experienced judges <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Third, companies headquartered in isolated geographical areas <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Fourth, companies that report greater shareholder equity <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Fifth, companies with routinely appointed creditors' committees <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Sixth, companies with debtor-in-possession (DIP) loans <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed.
