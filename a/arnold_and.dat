These actions effectively denied the British any hope of immediately moving onto the lake.|$|E

5|$|Many of the Green Mountain Boys {{objected to}} Arnold's wish to command, insisting {{that they would}} go home rather than serve under anyone other than Ethan Allen. <b>Arnold</b> <b>and</b> Allen worked out an agreement, but no {{documented}} evidence exists concerning the deal. According to Arnold, he was given joint command of the operation. Some historians have supported Arnold's contention, while others suggest he was merely given the right to march next to Allen.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of May 9, Benedict Arnold quite unexpectedly arrived on the scene. Flourishing a commission from the Massachusetts Committee of Safety, he asserted his right to command the expedition. The assembled men refused to acknowledge his authority, insisting they would only follow Allen's lead.
