5|$|During the 14th century, the tengu {{began to}} trouble {{the world outside}} of the Buddhist clergy, and like their ominous {{ancestors}} the tiāngǒu, the tengu became creatures associated with war.

5|$|Hall of Poccetti: The frescoes on {{the vault}} were once <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> Bernardino Poccetti, but now {{attributed}} to Matteo Rosselli. In {{the center of}} the hall is a table (1716) commissioned by Cosimo III. In the hall are also some works by Rubens and Pontormo.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved on}} {{in the summer of}} 759; this has {{traditionally}} been <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> famine, but Hung believes that frustration is a more likely reason. He next spent around six weeks in Qinzhou (now Tianshui, Gansu province), where he wrote more than sixty poems.|$|E

40|$|My aim in {{this paper}} is to examine Aristotle’s notions of {{priority}} in order to determine which sort of priority he <b>ascribes</b> <b>to</b> substances. I try to show that we cannot accept the traditional idea that a substance’s priority must be understood as existential independence. Aristotle rather <b>ascribes</b> <b>to</b> substances a priority in terms of completion, as he <b>ascribes</b> <b>to</b> substances-of-something some specific sort of causal-explanatory priority. Besides that, Aristotle argues, against Platonism, that these two sorts of priority (completion priority and causal-explanatory priority) must be kept apart from each other in any successful ontology...|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} centuries after Alexander's death, {{probably}} in Alexandria, {{a quantity of}} the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the Alexander Romance, later falsely <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> Callisthenes and therefore known as Pseudo-Callisthenes. This text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages, containing many dubious stories, and was translated into numerous languages.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{advances}} in astronomy came {{about with the}} introduction of new technology, including the spectroscope and photography. Fraunhofer discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859, Kirchhoff <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> the presence of different elements. Stars were proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but {{with a wide range of}} temperatures, masses, and sizes.|$|E
5|$|Some modern genealogical {{researchers}} consider John {{a possible}} father to Theodora Axouchina, wife of Emperor Alexios I Megas Komnenos of Trebizond (r. 1204–1222), {{but that is}} conjectural: the family name Axouchina is <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> her because her eldest son, the Trebizondian emperor John I Megas Komnenos Axouchos (r. 1235–1238), bore it as well.|$|E

5|$|The Art of War is {{traditionally}} <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> Sun Tzu. It presents {{a philosophy of}} war for managing conflicts and winning battles.

5|$|The Whitechapel murders were {{committed}} {{in or near}} the impoverished Whitechapel district in the East End of London between 3 April 1888 and 13 February 1891.

5|$|The {{terrestrial}} globe is significant in conjecturing that North America {{is separated from}} Asia, unlike the globe of Monachus.

5|$|According to De ponderibus et mensuris, {{a famous}} 13th century text {{that exists in}} {{numerous}} variations and is often <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> Dino di Garbo, the system of weights used in Salerno {{was different from the}} systems used in Padua and Bologna. As {{can be seen from the}} table, it was also different from the Roman weight system used by Galenus and Dioscorides and from all modern apothecaries' systems: The ounce was divided into 9drachms, rather than 8drachms.|$|E
5|$|An epigraphic {{reference}} <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> Garulaka Simhaditya, {{the son of}} Varahdas, {{the king}} of Dwarka, is inscribed on a copper plate dated to 574AD, found in Palitana. The Greek writer of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea referred to a place called Baraca, which has been interpreted as present-day Dwarka. A reference made in Ptolemy's Geography identified Barake as {{an island in the}} Gulf of Kanthils, which has also been inferred to mean Dwarka.|$|E

5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E
5|$|Born a slave in Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman {{was beaten}} and whipped by her various masters as a child. Early in life, she {{suffered}} a traumatic head wound when an irate slave owner threw a heavy metal weight intending to hit another slave and hit her instead. The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of hypersomnia, which occurred throughout her life. She was a devout Christian and experienced strange visions and vivid dreams, which she <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> premonitions from God.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Roman {{soldiers}} seem to {{have been}} modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves are believed to have copied their style of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.|$|E

5|$|Ecgbert (diedNovember 766) was an 8th-century cleric who {{established}} {{the archdiocese of}} York in 735. In 737, Ecgbert's brother became king of Northumbria and the two siblings worked together on ecclesiastical issues. Ecgbert was a correspondent of Bede and Boniface {{and the author of}} a legal code for his clergy. Other works have been <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> him, although the attribution is doubted by modern scholars.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 the BBC Three series Being Human {{became popular}} in Britain. It {{featured}} an unconventional trio of a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who are sharing a flat in Bristol. Another popular vampire-related show is CW's The Vampire Diaries. The continuing {{popularity of the}} vampire theme has been <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> a combination of two factors: the representation of sexuality and the perennial dread of mortality.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{the vampire}} is {{generally}} {{held to be}} a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> the ignorance of the body's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating {{the figure of the}} vampire to explain the mysteries of death. Porphyria was also linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.|$|E
