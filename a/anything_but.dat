5|$|Amelia is a {{domestic}} novel taking place largely in London during 1733. It describes the hardships suffered {{by a young}} couple newly married. Against her mother's wishes, Amelia marries Captain William Booth, a dashing young army officer. The couple run away to London. In Book II, William is unjustly imprisoned in Newgate, and is subsequently seduced by Miss Matthews. During this time, it is revealed that Amelia was in a carriage accident and that her nose was ruined. Although this brings about jokes at Amelia's behalf, Booth refuses to regard her as <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> beautiful.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the first}} {{exposition}} of empirical materialism {{in the history}} of philosophy is in the Cārvāka school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> matter (which they defined as being made up of the four elements), including God and the soul. Therefore, they held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was not said to survive death.|$|E

5|$|As can {{be discerned}} from the {{previous}} description, the 1945 campaign was <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> genteel and polite. Jolliffe replied by giving a radio speech (written {{with the assistance of}} Lister Sinclair) that accused Drew of running a political Gestapo in Ontario. In the speech excerpt below, Jolliffe alleged that a secret department of the Ontario Provincial Police was acting as a political police – spying on the opposition and the media.|$|E
5|$|Cromwell's programme, {{assisted}} by Anne Boleyn's influence over episcopal appointments, {{was not merely}} against the clergy {{and the power of}} Rome. He persuaded Henry that safety from political alliances that Rome might attempt to bring together lay in negotiations with the German Lutheran princes. There also seemed to be a possibility that Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, might act to avenge his rejected aunt (Queen Catherine) and enforce the Pope's excommunication. It never came to <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> it brought to England Lutheran ideas: three sacraments only—baptism, Eucharist and penance—which Henry was prepared to countenance to maintain the possibility of an alliance.|$|E
5|$|NSB soon bought all {{the shares}} of the company, and also made an {{agreement}} that operations on the Arendal Line would {{be taken over by}} Timetoget. However, the new company tried to take a short-cut in giving engineers only a six-week training program, instead of the usual 18 months. This made NSB want to discontinue operations. They bought {{out the rest of the}} shareholders, and liquidated the company. Timetoget never ran <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> trials on the Bratsberg Line.|$|E

5|$|Throughout their marriage, George I and Olga were {{a close-knit}} couple, and {{contrary}} to the prevailing custom spent much time with their children, {{who grew up in}} a warm family atmosphere. With age, however, George I argued with his sons and Olga lamented the quarrels that divided the family periodically. In private, Olga and George I conversed in German because it was the only language they both spoke at the time of their marriage. With their offspring, they spoke mainly English, although the children were required to speak Greek among themselves, and Prince Andrew refused to speak <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> Greek to his parents.|$|E
5|$|Williams' premiership was {{considered}} controversial outside of Newfoundland and Labrador. Events such as ordering all Canadian flags {{to be removed}} from provincial government buildings, and launching the <b>Anything</b> <b>But</b> Conservative campaign in the 2008 federal election, garnered national attention. While Williams remains a controversial politician outside Newfoundland and Labrador, he was continuously ranked {{as one of the most}} popular premiers in Canada, with approval ratings in the province consistently in the high seventies and eighties.|$|E
5|$|According to Domhoff, {{many people}} {{seem to believe that}} the United States is ruled from behind the scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small secretive group that wants to change the {{government}} system or put the country under the control of a world government. In the past the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> a limited role.|$|E

5|$|As {{the period}} of Sovietization and Stalinism began, the PZPR was <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> united. The most {{important}} split among the communists occurred before the union with PPS, when the Stalinists forced Gomułka out of the PPR's top office and suppressed his native communist faction. The PZPR had become divided into several factions, which espoused different views and methods and sought different degrees of the Polish state's distinction and independence from the Soviet Union. While the official ideology, the Russian version of Marxism, was new to Poland, the communist regime continued, in many psychologically and practically important ways, the precepts, methods and manners of past Polish ruling circles, {{including those of the}} Sanation, the National Democracy, and the 19th century traditions of cooperation with the partitioning powers.|$|E
5|$|Because of its poor flying ability, {{large size}} and {{possible}} island tameness, the broad-billed parrot was easy prey for sailors who visited Mauritius, and their nests {{would have been}} extremely vulnerable to predation by introduced crab-eating macaques and rats. Various sources indicate the bird was aggressive, {{which may explain why}} it held out so long against introduced animals after all. The bird is believed to have become extinct by the 1680s, when the palms it may have sustained itself on were harvested on a large scale. Unlike other parrot species, which were often taken as pets by sailors, there are no records of broad-billed parrots being transported from Mauritius either live or dead, perhaps because of the stigma associated with ravens. The birds would not in any case have survived such a journey if they refused to eat <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> seeds.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with growing}} {{legal and illegal}} {{competition}} for the globally marketed ASA, Bayer worked to cement the connection between Bayer and Aspirin. One strategy it developed was to switch from distributing Aspirin powder for pharmacists to press into pill form to distributing standardized tablets—complete with the distinctive Bayer cross logo. In 1903 the company set up an American subsidiary, with a converted factory in Rensselaer, New York, to produce Aspirin for the American market without paying import duties. Bayer also sued the most egregious patent violators and smugglers. The company's attempts to hold onto its Aspirin sales incited criticism from muckraking journalists and the American Medical Association, especially after the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act that prevented trademarked drugs from being listed in the United States Pharmacopeia; Bayer listed ASA with an intentionally convoluted generic name (monoacetic acid ester of salicylic acid) to discourage doctors referring to <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> Aspirin.|$|E

5|$|Flagged {{initially}} as {{a transit}} event by the satellite, Kepler-9d {{was given the}} designation KOI 377.03. It was recognized as a potential planet after a study into the system confirmed Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c, but follow-up studies had to be completed to verify that it was indeed a planet, and that the apparent transit event was not due to a background eclipsing binary star in the aperture of Kepler's photometer. Kepler's team exhaustively disproved that the small transit event could have been <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> a planet, and their results {{were published in the}} Astrophysical Journal on January 1, 2011. Follow-up observations were conducted by the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, as well as the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California.|$|E
5|$|Hood was {{initially}} fitted with flying-off platforms mounted {{on top of}} 'B' and 'X' turrets, from which Fairey Flycatchers could launch. During her 1929–31 refit, the platform was removed from 'X' turret and a trainable, folding catapult was installed on her quarterdeck, along with a crane to recover a seaplane. She embarked a Fairey IIIF from No. 444 Flight of the Royal Air Force. During the 1932 West Indies cruise, the catapult proved {{to be difficult to}} operate in <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> a calm sea, as it was frequently awash in bad weather. The catapult and crane were removed in 1932, along with the flying-off platform on 'B' turret.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Glenn T. Seaborg {{established}} that when thorium was bombarded with neutrons, {{it could be}} transformed into fissile uranium-233. This was another possible route to an atomic bomb, especially if {{it turned out that}} uranium-233 could be more easily separated from thorium than plutonium from uranium. It was not pursued further because uranium-233 production would have required a complete redesign of the Hanford reactors; but in April 1944 the Metallurgical Laboratory's Thorfin R. Rogness calculated that a nuclear reactor containing thorium could produce enough uranium-233 to sustain its reaction without adding <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> more thorium. This was very interesting, because {{at the time it was}} thought that uranium might be scarce, whereas thorium was at least ten times more plentiful.|$|E

5|$|In {{writing the}} book that would become Washington: A Life, Chernow made {{extensive}} use of the archival evidence left by Washington's meticulous record-keeping. These documents included recently discovered written correspondence, maps, and images from the Papers of George Washington, made available by a University of Virginia research project, which began in 1968. Washington: A Life took six years to complete, {{the first four years}} of which were spent purely on research. In June 2009, {{near the end of his}} work on the book, Chernow slipped on a stair and broke his ankle in the three places. He was unable to do <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> read for the following months, and later attributed the injury with allowing him to return to the book with a fresh perspective and improve the manuscript.|$|E
5|$|On 23 April, Hitler {{appointed}} General of the Artillery Helmuth Weidling, {{commander of}} the LVI Panzer Corps, as the {{commander of the}} Berlin Defense Area, replacing Lieutenant-Colonel (Oberstleutnant) Ernst Kaether. Despite the commands being issued from the Führerbunker, by 25 April the Red Army had consolidated their investment of Berlin, and there was no prospect that the German defence could do <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> delay the city's capture. Hitler summoned Field Marshal Robert Ritter von Greim from Munich to Berlin to take over command of the Luftwaffe from Hermann Göring. Along with his mistress and crack test pilot, Hanna Reitsch, he arrived on 26 April.|$|E
5|$|Pei and {{his team}} also {{designed}} a united urban area for Washington, D.C., L'Enfant Plaza (named for French-American architect Pierre Charles L'Enfant). Pei's associate Araldo Cossutta was the lead architect for the plaza's North Building (955 L'Enfant Plaza SW) and South Building (490 L'Enfant Plaza SW). Vlastimil Koubek was the architect for the East Building (L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, located at 480 L'Enfant Plaza SW), and for the Center Building (475 L'Enfant Plaza SW; now the United States Postal Service headquarters). The team set out with a broad vision that was praised by both the Washington Post and Washington Star (which rarely agreed on <b>anything),</b> <b>but</b> funding problems forced revisions and {{a significant reduction in}} scale.|$|E
