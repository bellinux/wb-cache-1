40|$|Ondansetron, a carbazol {{antiemetic}} drug, {{acts as a}} competitive, {{highly selective}} inhibitor of 5 - HT 3 serotonin receptors and it {{is used for the}} prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy and for postoperative nausea and vomiting. It is thought to block the 5 - HT 3 receptors at both peripheral sites in the gastrointestinal tract as well as within the area postrema in the central nervous system. Ondansetron is given by intramuscular or slow intravenous injection as hydrochloride salt, by mouth as hydrochloride salt or base, or rectally as base. Dosing varies according to the purpose from 8 to 32 mg, expressed in terms of the base. To prevent delayed emesis with less emetogenic chemotherapy and radiotherapy 8 mg by mouth twice a day are given for up to 5 days after the end of a course of chemotherapy. Transdermal application can be an alternative route for ondansetron, which might allow administration of lower doses and avoidance of first - pass metabolism. It can also provide sustained and constant plasma levels and improve patient compliance. In the present study, the in vitro permeation of ondansetron through human cadaver epidermis, as a preliminary step towards the development of a transdermal therapeutic system, was investigated. In vitro release studies were carried out using modified Franz diffusion cells and human epidermis, taken from cadaver skin by heat separation technique. In order to estimate the effect of the type and the concentration of the penetration enhancers and the skin from different donors, an 8132 <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>factorial</b> <b>design</b> was used. Formulations containing lauric acid and oleic acid as penetration enhancers, showed the largest Q values (amounts of ondansetron permeated per unit area of epidermal membrane (μg/cm 2)) at 24, 48 and 72 h, as well as steady state flux values, among all formulations tested. The other enhancers increased the flux in the following order: lauryl alcohol > glycerol monooleate > Azone® > cineole > oleyl alcohol > 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone. Moreover, the concentration of the penetration enhancer and the type of the skin were proved to affect significantly the permeation rate of ondansetron through human epidermis. From the results obtained it was shown that the formulations containing lauric acid or oleic acid at 5 % or 10 % could increase sufficiently the permeation of ondansetron. Therefore the transdermal administration of ondansetron seems feasible. The formation of ion pair between ondansetron and lauric acid, as a possible mechanism of its enhancing action, was also investigated. Several techniques were used to reveal the formation of an ion pair complex. Partitioning experiments, where the n-octanol/water coefficient was measured, showed an increase in the distribution coefficient {{in the presence of the}} acid, possibly as a result of the formation of more lipophilic ion pairs between the charged molecules of ondansetron and lauric acid. Further evidence of complex formation between ondansetron and lauric acid, was gained from the 13 C-NMR spectra of ondansetron, lauric acid and their mixture (molar ratio 1 : 1). The NMR spectra revealed alterations to the magnetic environment of the carbon atoms adjacent to the ionized group, which are the carbonyl group of the acid and the nitrogen of the imidazole ring of ondansetron. This evidence substantiates the theory of ion pair formation. Finally thermal analysis of the of the binary mixtures of ondansetron and lauric acid revealed the formation of an addition compound, with different melting point from pure ondansetron and lauric acid, which is thermodynamically favored. It is evident therefore that the enhancing effect of lauric acid on the transdermal permeation of ondansetron can be attributed not only on its direct effect on the skin structure, but also to the formation of an ion pair between the drug and the enhancer. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Non-regular {{two-level}} fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs,</b> such as Plackett–Burman designs, {{are becoming}} popular choices {{in many areas}} of scientific investigation due to their run size economy and flexibility. The run size of non-regular two-level <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> is a multiple of 4. They fill the gaps left by the regular two-level fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> whose run size is always a power of 2 (4, 8, 16, 32, …). In non-regular <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> each main effect is partially confounded with all the two-factor interactions not involving itself. Because of this complex aliasing structure, non-regular <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> had not received sufficient attention until recently. [...] . In practical applications of non-regular designs, it is often in the case that some of the two-factor interactions are important and need to be estimated in addition to the main effects. In this article, we consider how to select non-regular two-level fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> when some of the two-factor interactions are presumably important. We propose and study a method to select the optimal non-regular two-level fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> in the situation that some of the two-factor interactions are potentially important.

Finally, motivated by the need for smaller optimal discrete choice experiments, we propose a novel application of blocked <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> for designing discrete choice experiments for estimating main effects, and main effects plus some two-factor interactions, with 100 % efficiency.
