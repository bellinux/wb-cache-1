[...] Furthermore, the site noted that [...] "the sound that takes you by surprise may be your own crying." [...] Novelist Lev Grossman, {{in an interview with}} NPR, praised the backstory of the Ice King and the exploration of his condition, noting that his origin is [...] "psychologically plausible." [...] Grossman praised {{the way the}} series was able to tackle the issues of mental illness, saying: [...] "It's very affecting. My dad has been going through having Alzheimer's, and he's forgotten so much about who he used to be. And I look at him and think this cartoon is <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> dying." ...|$|E
500|$|Arular {{takes its}} title from the {{political}} code name employed by M.I.A.'s father, Arul Pragasam, during his involvement with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, popularly known as the Tamil Tigers; she contends that her father's [...] "revolutionary ideals" [...] are the album's thematic base. [...] "In Sri Lankan, arular means 'enlightenment from the sunshine' or something", she remarked, [...] "but a friend pointed {{out that it was}} a pun in English – 'a ruler' – which is funny because he is a politician. And my mum always used to say <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> 'He was so useless, all he ever gave you was his name'. So I turned it around and turned that something into nothing. And at the same time I {{thought it would be a}} good way to find him. If he really was an egomaniac, he'd be looking himself up and he'd get this pop album stealing his name that would turn out to be me, and he'd have to get in touch", a prediction which ultimately came true.) ...|$|E
2500|$|I think <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{being called}} ‘boy’, my uncle being called ‘boy’, my brother, {{coming back from}} Vietnam and being called ‘boy’. So I {{questioned}} myself: “What does a black man have to do before he’s given the respect as a man?” So when I was 18 years old, when I {{was old enough to}} fight and die for my country, old enough to drink, old enough to vote, I said I was old enough to be called a man. I self-ordained myself Mr. T so the first word out of everybody’s mouth is [...] "Mr." [...] That’s a sign of respect that my father didn’t get, that my brother didn’t get, that my mother didn’t get.|$|E

2500|$|According to Kaminsky, much of Huston's vision {{probably}} {{came from}} his early experience as a painter {{on the streets of}} Paris. While there, he studied art and worked at it {{for a year and a}} half. Huston continued painting as a hobby for most of his life. Kaminsky also notes that most of Huston's films [...] "reflected this prime interest in the image, the moving portrait and the use of color." [...] Huston explored the use of [...] "stylistic framing", especially well-planned close-ups, in much of his directing. In his first film, The Maltese Falcon, for instance, Huston sketched out all of his scenes beforehand, [...] "like canvases of paintings". His daughter, Anjelica Huston adds that even for his subsequent films, he sketched storyboards [...] "constantly". She agrees that for her father, [...] "it was a form of study, and my father was a painter, a very good one." [...] She also notes that [...] "there was an extremely developed sensory quality <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> he didn't miss a trick." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hughes had a {{very poor}} {{relationship}} with his father, with whom he lived in Mexico {{for a brief period}} in 1919. Upon graduating from high school in June 1920, Hughes returned to Mexico to live with his father, hoping to convince him to support his plan to attend Columbia University. Hughes later said that, prior to arriving in Mexico, [...] "I had been thinking <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and his strange dislike of his own people. I didn't understand it, because I was a Negro, and I liked Negroes very much." [...] Initially, his father had hoped for Hughes to attend a university abroad, and to study for a career in engineering. On these grounds, he was willing to provide financial assistance to his son but did not support his desire to be a writer. Eventually, Hughes and his father came to a compromise: Hughes would study engineering, so long as he could attend Columbia. His tuition provided; Hughes left his father after more than a year. While at Columbia in 1921, Hughes managed to maintain a B+ grade average. He left in 1922 because of racial prejudice. He was attracted more to the people and the neighborhood of Harlem than his studies, though he continued writing poetry.|$|E
