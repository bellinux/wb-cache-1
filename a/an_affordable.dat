About 200,000â€“250,000 adult males in Rome received the dole, amounting to about 33kg. per month, for a per annum total of about 100,000 tons of wheat primarily from Sicily, north Africa, and Egypt. The dole cost at least 15% of state revenues, but improved living conditions and family life among the lower classes, and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on the estates of the landowning class.|$|E

They would harness the resources and expertise of the business, non-profit, and government sectors.

They are greatly preferable to other options such as selling off public housing, boosting inflationary rent subsidies or encouraging renters into unwise home purchase commitments...|$|R
