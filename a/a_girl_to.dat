5|$|Numerous fady protect {{wilderness}} areas, particularly {{including the}} Ankarana massif. Excessive cutting of mangrove trees for wood or {{the setting of}} bush fires are both prohibited, as {{is the use of}} nets with holes less than 15 millimeters to prevent catching immature fish. Certain species are protected through fady that forbid hunting them, including sharks, rays and crocodiles. Many fady also exist to regulate relations between the sexes. For instance, it is taboo for <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> <b>to</b> wash her own brother's clothing. Conservative communities adhere to a fady against medical injections, surgery or modern medicines due to their association with their historic enemies the Merina, who were the first to use them widely; instead, tromba ceremonies and traditional herbal remedies are commonly used for healing. These taboos are most strongly applied in the center of Antankarana territory around the village of Ambatoharaña and less so in the villages at the periphery of the region.|$|E

5|$|A human {{going into}} an ala’s house, which is {{frequently}} {{deep in a}} forest, but may also be in the clouds, in a lake, spring, cave, gigantic tree, or other hidden remote place, or on an inhospitable mountain, can have varied consequences. If he approaches the ala with an appeal, and does not mention the differences between her and humans, he will be rewarded. Otherwise, he will be cruelly punished. According to one story, a stepdaughter, driven away from home by her stepmother, comes to an ala’s house; addresses her with the word mother; picks lice from the ala’s hair full of worms; and feeds the ala’s “livestock” of owls, wolves, badgers, and other wild animals; behaving and talking as if these things are quite normal to her, and is rewarded by the ala with a chest filled with gold. When the stepmother’s daughter comes to the ala’s house, she does the opposite, and the ala punishes her and her mother by sending them a chest of snakes, which blind them. In another example, when a prince asks an ala for her daughter’s hand, she saves him from other ale, and helps him get married. But when <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> <b>to</b> whom an ala is the godmother visits the ala with her mother, the ala eats them both because the mother talked about the strange things in her house.|$|E

25|$|According to the myth, Zeus {{gave the}} infant Dionysus {{to the care}} of Hermes. One version of the story is that Hermes took the boy to King Athamas and his wife Ino, Dionysus' aunt. Hermes bade the couple to raise the boy as <b>a</b> <b>girl,</b> <b>to</b> hide him from Hera's wrath. Another version is that Dionysus was taken to the rain-nymphs of Nysa, who nourished his infancy and childhood, and for their care Zeus rewarded them by placing them as the Hyades among the stars (see Hyades star cluster). Other {{versions}} have Zeus giving him to Rhea, or to Persephone to raise in the Underworld, away from Hera. Alternatively, he was raised by Maro.|$|E

Otherwise, the individual may not be allowed to participate in ceremonies or even in social rituals such as marriage. A man {{will not be allowed to}} marry or have any special relationship with a woman who did not go to an initiation, because she is not considered to be a woman.|$|E

25|$|A devadasi's {{life after}} {{dedication}} was obviously very different centuries ago. Nowadays After dedication of <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> <b>to</b> the temple, {{she has to}} take bath every day {{early in the morning}} and should present herself at the temple during morning worship of Yellamma. She is not allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum. But she will bow to the deity from outside. Thereafter she sweeps compound of the temple. Every Tuesday and Friday she goes for yoga along with senior jogatis (yoga teachers). During this period she learns innumerable songs in praise of Yellamma and her son Parashurama. If she shows some aptitude to learn playing instruments she will be given training by her elder jogatis. In Yellampura and other villages Devadasis do not dance but this is performed by eunuch companions. The main functions of Devadasis would be singing and playing stringed musical instruments and Jagate. They form a small group and go for joga, from house to house on every Tuesday and Friday (Jogan Shankar, 1990).|$|E
25|$|Not every suicide {{case was}} successful. Some mothers who had drowned their {{children}} were unable to drown themselves thereafter. In other cases, doses of poison proved to be lethal for children, but not for their mothers. There were also cases where children survived attempted drownings. After a failed suicide, some killed themselves by others methods. A mother and her repeatedly raped daughter, for instance, died by hanging themselves in an attic, after repeatedly failing to drown themselves in the Peene river. Another mother who had poisoned and buried three of her four children before, tried to hang herself on an oak three times, only to be prevented to do so each time by Soviet soldiers. There are further records of Soviet soldiers preventing suicides by retrieving people from the river and nursing cut wrists. In another case, a grandfather forcibly took away a razor blade from a mother {{who was about to}} kill her children and herself after being raped by Soviet soldiers and hearing of the death of her husband. After Soviet soldiers had raped <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> <b>to</b> death and shot her father, an aunt cut her daughter's and son's wrists as well as her own. The other women of the family committed suicide, only one aunt was able to save the grandmother. One family survived, because the 15-year-old son persuaded his mother, who had become a rape victim, to abort her induced drowning, when she was already being dragged by the Tollense river.|$|E

500|$|Syers' {{entry into}} the World Championships {{prompted}} the ISU to discuss the subject of women competing against men at their next Congress in 1903. The concerns raised were that [...] "(1) the dress prevents the judges from seeing the feet; (2) a judge might judge <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> <b>to</b> whom he was attached; and (3) {{it is difficult to}} compare women with men." [...] The Congress voted six to three in favour of barring women from the championships.|$|E

According to Larry Evans, Fischer's first sexual experience was with <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> <b>to</b> whom Evans introduced him during the tournament. Pal Benko says that Fischer did horribly in the tournament [...] "because he {{got caught up in}} women and sex. Afterwards, Fischer said he'd never mix women and chess together, and kept the promise."

500|$|It was not {{uncommon}} for <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> <b>to</b> learn her father's trade and {{for a woman to}} share her husband's trade, since the entire family often helped run medieval shops and farms. Many guilds also accepted the membership of widows, so they might continue their husband's business. Under this system, some women trained in horse-related trades, and there are records of women working as farriers and saddle-makers. [...] On farms, where every hand was needed, excessive emphasis on division of labour was impracticable, and women often worked alongside men (on their own farms or as hired help), leading the farm horses and oxen, and managing their care.|$|E
