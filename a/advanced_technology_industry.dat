40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to compare the {{importance}} of government policies upon the development of <b>advanced</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> in five countries: France, West Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Japan. Three <b>advanced</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> were selected: microelectronics, machine tools and advanced materials. Data were collected from governments in the five countries, academia, independent research organizations, trade associations, industry and international organizations. The data were analyzed using statistical procedures and the results were related to classical and the "new" theories of comparative advantage determinants for the five countries. Critical analysis was also undertaken of the theories that postulate the role of government policies for industrial growth {{in the light of the}} rapid geographic diffusion of <b>advanced</b> <b>technology</b> sectors across national boundaries. As a result of these analyses the role of government policies upon the development of <b>advanced</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> was identified in the five countries.

40|$|Abstract- The {{literature}} on the theory of regional industrial success, including that focused on regional innovation systems, provides the conceptual foundation for this exploration {{of the extent to}} which firms in clusters of <b>advanced</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industry</b> depend on inter-regional sources for a wide variety of knowledge inputs to support innovation. The substantive focus is the electronics cluster of the Toronto region, Canada’s largest manufacturing center. A small, stratified sample of establishments drawn from this cluster is used to verify the importance of external sources of material inputs, and other knowledge sources and the strength of distant market connections. Inter-regional and local collaboration vary in importance as a result of scale-dependent resource differences between firms and in response to choices associated with foreign rather than domestic ownership. The results support the rejection of simple models of clusters and learning regions in which internal connections are privileged over inter-regional and international transactions operating either between or within firms...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{the ever-changing}} {{advanced}} technology market conditions, {{time to market}} is the essential factor in deciding profitability of a product. This leads to exploring different areas to make production faster, which then adds to the manufacturing lead times. This in turn requires the needed information on which the decision is based in {{the least amount of}} time. This research paper discusses one such solution to resolve the above problem by introducing a web based interactive application that uses a structured methodology to collect, sort and retrieve large number of data. Various benefits of the application like clear identification of project scope to minimize change orders and cost over runs, shortening the time required for facility programming, reducing programming cost and promoting standardization across the <b>advanced</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industry</b> are also discussed.

40|$|Carbon {{composite}} structures {{are widely used}} in virtually all <b>advanced</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> for a multitude of applications. The high strength-to-weight ratio and resistance to aggressive service environments make them highly desirable. Automotive, aerospace, and petroleum industries extensively use, {{and will continue to}} use, this enabling technology. As a result of this broad range of use, field and test personnel are increasingly exposed to hazards associated with these structures. No single published document exists to address the hazards and make recommendations for the hazard controls required for the different exposure possibilities from damaged structures including airborne fibers, fly, and dust. The potential for personnel exposure varies depending on the application or manipulation of the structure. The effect of exposure to carbon hazards is not limited to personnel, protection of electronics and mechanical equipment must be considered as well. The various exposure opportunities defined in this document include pre-manufacturing fly and dust, the cured structure, manufacturing/machining, post-event cleanup, and post-event test and/or evaluation. Hazard control is defined as it is applicable or applied for the specific exposure opportunity.

30|$|The {{third body}} of {{literature}} that is tangentially addressed in this paper concerns development studies. It is tangential primarily because few of the political players are classic ‘developing countries’ though China has some such characteristics. Most are, accordingly, developed countries, newly industrialised countries or – China again - ‘emerging markets’. However, what is of more central relevance is changing conceptual frameworks. Fundamentally, as will be seen in more detail later, development studies is wedded to a linear and hierarchical view of the global value system, which is captured in the ‘chain’ terminology. As is also shown below, this has been subject to an auto-critique which elaborates five more or less complex variants on the basic ‘chain’ metaphor. This is partly because the GVC discourse seeks {{to be able to}} generalise about different globalized industries. But because it retains a notion of MNC domination at every link of the chain, it arguably loses leverage in <b>advanced</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> like ICT, and conceivably also automotives, where globally regionalized innovation systems such as Sao Paulo in Brazil produce more advanced bio-engines for cars and trucks than the West or China does. In the same way, the paper’s focus on ICT points to South Korea and Taiwan definitely, and RISs in China, probably, producing superior innovations in implementing chip-integration than US leaders like Texas Instruments and Broadcom. This is an extremely valuable insight for development studies in showing the varied ways development to the point of surpassing western innovation hegemony actually occurs.|$|R
40|$|Computer-aided {{design is}} the generic {{term for a}} rapidly proliferating set of {{techniques}} which have become mandatory for all who wish to maintain their competitive positions in {{an increasing number of}} industries. CAD practitioners in <b>advanced</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> such as aerospace and electronics are usually highly sophisticated in computer usage and therefore able to configure their own CAD environments to suit their requirements. Those, however, who are relatively new to computers, are faced with a bewildering set of choices over which they have to make decisions. Should they have a cheap terminal linked to a remote time-sharing bureau? Should they attempt to do their whole design job on a dedicated, medium-sized in-house computer? Or should they invest in a high capability, intelligent terminal backed up by access to a central (or network-distributed) number-crunching and data-bank facility? What graphic facilities should they use? A drum plotter, a storage-tube display, interactive refresh graphics unit, hardware rotation, conic generation, zooming, are all choices that are presented to them and the manufacturers' praise of their own line is often more confusing than helpful. The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, IIASA, has recently embarked on a World Survey of CAD, one of whose aims has been to provide guidance to would-be users on the establishment of CAD facilities suited to their needs.
