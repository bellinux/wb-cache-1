5|$|Along {{with the}} arcade, the other main draw for the centers since the {{beginning}} was its animatronic show, until the mid-1990s. More recently, less <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> been placed on animatronics. However, there are now several different styles of animatronic shows in use within the company, depending on when the location opened, whether it was renovated, and other factors.|$|E
5|$|Ampelosaurus lived {{alongside}} {{many other}} animals. Over 8500 specimens {{have been found}} alongside it, including gastropods, bivalves, crocodiles, other sauropods, plants and invertebrates in the Villalba de la Sierra, Gres de Saint-Chinian, Marnes Rouges Inférieures and Gres de Labarre formations. Recent <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> made Ampelosaurus {{one of the most}} well-known dinosaurs known from France.|$|E
5|$|An Environmental Protection Act in 1991 {{prohibited}} importing {{radioactive material}} for long-term storage or burial in Russia, but controversial legislation to allow imports for permanent storage {{was passed by}} the Russian Parliament and signed by President Putin in 2001. In the long term, the Russian plan is for deep geologic disposal. Most <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> been paid to locations where waste has accumulated in temporary storage at Mayak, near Chelyabinsk in the Ural Mountains, and in granite at Krasnoyarsk in Siberia.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the diverse}} range of {{accounting}} services and recent corporate collapses, <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> been drawn to ethical standards accepted within the accounting profession. These collapses {{have resulted in a}} widespread disregard for the reputation of the accounting profession. To combat the criticism and prevent fraudulent accounting, various accounting organizations and governments have developed regulations and remedies for improved ethics among the accounting profession.|$|E
5|$|For a phylum with {{relatively}} few species, ctenophores {{have a wide}} range of body plans. Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that {{it is very difficult to}} capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, and for decades after his death, Poulenc had a reputation, {{particularly}} {{in his native}} country, as a humorous, lightweight composer, and his religious music was often overlooked. During the 21st century more <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> been given to his serious works, with many new productions of Dialogues des Carmélites and La voix humaine worldwide, and numerous live and recorded performances of his songs and choral music.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} malaria {{stretches}} from its prehistoric origin as a zoonotic {{disease in the}} primates of Africa through to the 21st century. A widespread and potentially lethal human infectious disease, at its peak malaria infested every continent, except Antarctica. Its prevention and treatment have been targeted in science and medicine for hundreds of years. Since {{the discovery of the}} parasites which cause it, research <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> focused on their biology, {{as well as that of}} the mosquitoes which transmit the parasites.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that element}} 120 fills the 2f5/2 proton orbital, much <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> {{been given to}} the {{compound}} nucleus 302Ubn and its properties. Several experiments have been performed between 2000 and 2008 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna studying the fission characteristics of the compound nucleus 302Ubn. Two nuclear reactions have been used, namely 244Pu+58Fe and 238U+64Ni. The results have revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132Sn (Z=50, N=82). It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48Ca and 58Fe projectiles, indicating a possible future use of 58Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.|$|E
5|$|Gregory's work {{received}} little scholarly {{attention in the}} West until the mid-twentieth century, and he was historically treated as a minor figure in comparison to Basil the Great or Gregory of Nazianzus. As late as 1942, Hans Urs von Balthasar wrote that his work was virtually unknown. In {{part due to the}} scholarship of Balthasar and Jean Daniélou, by the 1950s Gregory became the subject of much serious theological research, with a critical edition of his work published (Gregorii Nysseni Opera), and the founding of the International Colloquium on Gregory of Nyssa. This <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> continued to the present day. Modern studies have mainly focused on Gregory's eschatology rather than his more dogmatic writings, and he has gained a reputation as an unconventional thinker whose thought arguably prefigures postmodernism. Major figures in contemporary research include Sarah Coakley, John Zizioulas and Robert Jenson.|$|E

5|$|Scholarship in {{the area}} of Jewish Christian studies has tended to be based on {{artificial}} constructs similar to those developed by the early Christian heresiologists, with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs and practices of these groups were based on theology. This has led to the perpetuation of ideological definitions that fail {{to take into account the}} pluriformity of these groups, reflecting differences in geography, time periods in history, and ethnicity. With respect to Epiphanius, and the Ebionites in particular, insufficient <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> been paid to the highly speculative nature of his theological constructs and his mixing together of disparate sources, including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus. In the end, he presents an enigmatic picture of the Ebionites and their place in early Christian history.|$|E

25|$|The Super Hornet {{also makes}} {{considerable}} use of panel joint serration and edge alignment. Considerable <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> {{been paid to}} the removal or filling of unnecessary surface join gaps and resonant cavities. Where the F/A-18A-D used grilles to cover various accessory exhaust and inlet ducts, the F/A-18E/F uses perforated panels that appear opaque to radar waves at the frequencies used. Careful <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> {{been paid to the}} alignment of many panel boundaries and edges, to direct reflected waves away from the aircraft in uniformly narrow angles.|$|E
