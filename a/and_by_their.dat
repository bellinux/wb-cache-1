5|$|After Arthur's {{death in}} January 1943, Ninah Cummer began {{collecting}} art in earnest. During the fifteen years before her death, Ninah expanded her art collection to sixty pieces, {{all of which}} are still in the Museum’s collection today. In 1957, the year before her death, Ninah announced that her gifts would “make only a small beginning toward a large vision” and hoped “that others will share this vision <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> interest and contributions will help establish here a center of beauty and culture worthy of the community.” She created the DeEtte Holden Cummer Museum Foundation, named for the deceased infant daughter of the Cummers, to manage her vision after her death.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} about earlier works, Sorabji's earliest known (albeit lost) composition is a transcription dating from 1914 of Delius's In a Summer Garden. His early works are predominantly piano sonatas, songs and piano concertos. Of these, Piano Sonatas Nos. 1–3 (1919; 1920; 1922) are compositionally the most ambitious and significant. They are characterised mainly by {{their use of the}} single-movement format <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> athematism. The main criticism levelled at them is that they lack stylistic consistency and organic form. Sorabji himself developed a largely unfavourable view of his early works, to the extent that late in his life he even considered destroying many of their manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, under Seydlitz's direction, by {{the start}} of the Seven Years' War, the cavalry had become Frederick's pride and joy: it had unrivaled {{training}} and an esprit de corps bolstered by Frederick's confidence in its members, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> confidence in Seydlitz. The King had issued orders that no Prussian cavalryman would allow himself to be attacked without a commensurate response, under penalty of being cashiered; consequently, Prussian cavalrymen were active, impetuous and aggressive. For the King, Seydlitz's cavalry became the dynamic factor in the army of the state, and would be the tool by which Frederick could challenge empires. In 1756, Seydlitz's cavalry became Frederick's weapon of choice.|$|E
5|$|Elves {{are born}} about one year from their {{conception}}. The {{day of their}} conception is celebrated, not the actual birthday itself. Their minds develop more quickly than their bodies; by their first year, they can speak, walk and even dance, and their quicker onset of mental maturity makes young Elves seem, to Men, older than they really are. Physical puberty comes in around their fiftieth to one hundredth year (by age fifty they reach their adult height), <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> first hundred years of life outside the womb all Elves are fully grown. Elven bodies eventually stop aging physically, while human bodies do not.|$|E

5|$|For {{passenger}} {{service the}} F40PH has another electrical alternator, the head-end generator. The HEP unit generates three-phase AC power at 480 V (500kW {{on the first}} order, 800kW on later units) for lighting, heating and air-conditioning the train. Originally, F40PHs powered the HEP alternator from the prime mover; from the head end to the train must be a constant frequency, and the prime mover had to turn at a constant 893 RPM while supplying head end power (even standing still, with the throttle in idle). Power to the traction motors was controlled by varying the field excitation of the main (traction) generator. On some later versions of the F40PH (and on many rebuilt F40s), a second small diesel engine {{at the rear of}} the locomotive powers the HEP alternator. In these engines, the prime-mover speed varies in the usual way; they can be identified by the diesel exhaust {{at the rear of the}} locomotive <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> quiet idle. Remaining F40s, with the constant-RPM prime movers, are noticeably louder.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{also found}} fault with Symeon for revering his spiritual father, Symeon the Studite. At that time, formal {{recognition}} of saints was seldom practiced and not obligatory, so revered monks were informally recognized and honored by monasteries <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> disciples. Every year the younger Symeon arranged a celebration honoring his teacher, which included {{an icon of}} Symeon the Studite and a service to him. Stephen rebuked Symeon for honoring his teacher as a saint, because in his opinion the Studite was not worth of any honor. The conflict between the two lasted for six years.|$|E
5|$|The rise of {{successful}} freedmen—through either political influence in imperial service, or wealth—is {{a characteristic of}} early Imperial society. The prosperity of a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by , <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> ownership {{of some of the}} most lavish houses at Pompeii, such as the House of the Vettii. The excesses of nouveau riche freedmen were satirized in the character of Trimalchio in the Satyricon by Petronius, who wrote in the time of Nero. Such individuals, while exceptional, are indicative of the upward social mobility possible in the Empire.|$|E

5|$|The steel-hooped cage crinoline, first {{patented}} in April 1856 by R.C. Milliet in Paris, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> {{agent in}} Britain {{a few months}} later, became extremely popular. Steel cage crinolines were mass-produced in huge quantity, with factories across the Western world producing tens of thousands in a year. Alternative materials, such as whalebone, cane, gutta-percha and even inflatable caoutchouc (natural rubber) were all used for hoops, although steel was the most popular. At its widest point, the crinoline could reach a circumference of up to six yards, although by the late 1860s, crinolines were beginning to reduce in size. By the early 1870s, the smaller crinolette and the bustle had largely replaced the crinoline.|$|E
5|$|Western astrology {{is founded}} on the {{movements}} and relative positions of celestial bodies such as the Sun, Moon and planets, which are analysed by their movement through signs of the zodiac (twelve spatial divisions of the ecliptic) <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> aspects (based on geometric angles) relative to one another. They are also considered by their placement in houses (twelve spatial divisions of the sky). Astrology's modern representation in western popular media is usually reduced to sun sign astrology, which considers only the zodiac sign of the Sun at an individual's date of birth, and represents only 1/12 of the total chart.|$|E
