40|$|To study <b>the</b> {{organization}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contractile apparatus in {{smooth muscle}} and its behavior during shortening, <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> dense bodies in contracting saponin skinned, isolated cells was analyzed from digital images collected at fixed time intervals. These cells were optically lucent so that punctate structures, identified immunocytochemically as dense bodies, were visible in {{them with the}} phase contrast microscope. Methods were adapted and developed to track the bodies and to study their relative motion. Analysis of their tracks or trajectories indicated that the bodies did not move passively as cells shortened and that nearby bodies often had similar patterns of motion. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relative motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bodies indicated that some bodies were structurally linked to one another or constrained so that {{the distance between them}} remained relatively constant during contraction.

Recently, the Atwood Group has self-assembled a nanocapsule not only capable of carrying cargo in its interior space, but should also be stable in water. This large neutral discrete pseudo-spherical coordination capsule is assembled from six pyrogallol[4]arene ligands and 24 copper(II) metal ions. <b>The</b> potential applications <b>of</b> this new material to bioanalytical chemistry, such as drug delivery, are enormous.

40|$|For {{structural}} {{health monitoring}} applications {{there is a}} need for simple and contact-less methods of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE). A number of damage detection techniques have been developed, such as frequency shift, generalised fractal dimension and wavelet transforms with the aim to identify, locate and determine <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> damage in a material or structure. These techniques are often tailored for factors such as (i) type of material, (ii) damage pattern (crack, delamination), and (iii) <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> any input signals (space and time). This paper describes and evaluates a wavelet-based damage detection framework that locates damage on cantilevered beams via NDE using computer vision technologies. <b>The</b> novelty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approach is <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> computer vision algorithms for <b>the</b> contact-less acquisition <b>of</b> modal shapes. Using the proposed method, <b>the</b> modal shapes <b>of</b> cantilever beams are reconstructed by extracting markers using sub-pixel Hough Transforms from images captured using conventional slow motion cameras. The extracted modal shapes are then used as an input for wavelet transform damage detection, exploiting both discrete and continuous variants.

METHODS: <b>The</b> <b>attachment</b> kinetics <b>of</b> HGK to samples of powdered human dentin (particle size 44 to 76 microm) were examined by use of 3 H-labeled cells. <b>The</b> morphology <b>of</b> attached epithelial cells was then determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: When the initial adhesion kinetics of cells on untreated dentin were tested, <b>the</b> percentage <b>of</b> attached HGK proved to be dependent on <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> plated cells and <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> incubation (from 0 to 12 hours). Conditioning the dentin by 3 % citric acid or by minocycline-HCl (at 0. 01, 0. 1, or 2. 5 %) significantly increased (P < 0. 005) keratinocyte attachment beyond 6 hours, without notable differences between the 2 substances at any concentration. <b>The</b> <b>attachment</b> kinetics <b>of</b> HGK preincubated for 24 hours by 10 microg/ml minocyline-HCl on untreated dentin was found to be similar to that observed for non-preincubated cells.

40|$|Background: The {{connections}} between the radius and the forearm, supporting the radiocarpal joint are poorly understood. They are also of high clinical importance as they are easily damaged through trauma and involved in <b>the</b> mechanical/functional decline <b>of</b> wrists with various degenerative joint diseases. This area {{has been a source}} of debate and inconsistency for decades due to <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> reproducible, quantitative studies, and <b>the</b> recurrent use <b>of</b> different descriptions and terminology. The current study aims to accurately define the key ligaments supporting the radiocarpal joint by quantifying the size, shape and <b>attachment</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ligamentous <b>structures</b> around <b>the</b> distal radius. Materials and Methods: <b>The</b> various <b>attachments</b> <b>of</b> each radiocarpal ligament were analysed in 10 anatomic preparations using gross, histological and 3 D morphometric approaches. Each ligament fascicular pattern was traced from one attachment to another; diversions into non-fascicular (disorganised) tissue were excised. <b>The</b> dimensions <b>of</b> each ligament were measured three different ways: manual with callipers, from a digital photograph using ImageJ and with a 3 D digitizer to create and measure a virtual 3 D model of each structure. Two parameters were analysed in three different levels: the radial, middle and ulnar length as well as the proximal, middle and distal width. <b>The</b> area <b>of</b> ligamentous <b>attachment</b> (enthesis) <b>of</b> each radiocarpal ligament was measured with the microscribe digitiser and confirmed histologically. Results: <b>The</b> ligamentous <b>attachments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distal radius are highly variable. Unlike the manual and digital measurements, microscribe measurements provide more reproducible data as there was no significant difference between <b>the</b> rounds <b>of</b> measurement for all structures (p> 0. 05). Histological analysis confirmed the gross findings with more quantitative details about each attachment. Conclusions: These results provide an important insight towards a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex radiocarpal ligament anatomy with a morphometric description. The microscribe method gave more consistent results than the manual and digital methods and it is probably more accurate. The current study may suggest a special consideration in relation to the carpal instability aetiology and management.

With proper GVT analysts can determine the stiffness distribution, natural frequencies, mode shapes and structural damping of each airplane components, which are needed for flutter and dynamic loads analyses. Hence, the results from GVT are crucial. The problem identified {{in this study is}} focused on structural design, which can lead to catastrophic situations, if proper attention is not given to GVT results. In GVT, analysts attempt to instrument most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airplane while often neglecting secondary structures such as bungees, gears, control surfaces, etc. These secondary structures must also be considered during GVT in identifying the in-phase and out-of-phase modes in order to achieve higher accuracy when tuning <b>the</b> stiffness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary <b>structure.</b> During <b>the</b> stiffness tuning process for the flutter analysis, tuning <b>the</b> primary <b>structure</b> stiffness to in-phase torsion mode can be considered as a conservative approach and will require design change. Conversely, if <b>the</b> stiffness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary <b>structure</b> is tuned to out-of-phase torsion mode, which is always higher, the analysis becomes unconservative. <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> this study is to reconstruct <b>the</b> above-mentioned problem <b>of</b> in-phase and out-of-phase vibration modes of a cantilever plate with an attached secondary structure, replicating a simple model of aircraft wing structure. This includes performing the modal experiments and finite element analysis (FEA) of a cantilever plate (primary structure) with and without flexible links (secondary <b>structure)</b> attached to <b>the</b> plate and characterizing the in-phase and out-of-phase modes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flexible links. A thorough study using frequency response functions (FRFs) is performed to characterize the modes using different accelerometer 'raw data' readings measured from different locations on the dynamic system. For GVT <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cantilever plate, natural frequencies associated with the respective mode shapes are identified and calculated and a comparison is made between the test results, the FEA results, and from an analytical approach. A parametric study is then conducted to evaluate and quantify the change in <b>the</b> frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> in-phase and out-of-phase modes with the change in the chord-wise and span-wise location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flexible <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secondary <b>structure</b> to <b>the</b> primary <b>structure,</b> and due to the change in <b>the</b> compliant stiffness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flexible link to the plate.

First, we examined <b>the</b> cytotoxicity <b>of</b> each component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> OPF hydrogel formulation and the resulting crosslinked network. Marrow stromal cells (MSCs) exhibited different viability with respect to OPF synthesized with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) of various molecular weights, crosslinking agent (PEG-diacylate (PEG-DA)), and the redox initiator pairs. Once crosslinked, the leachable products from the OPF hydrogels had minimal adverse effects on <b>the</b> viability <b>of</b> MSCs. Next study investigated <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> incorporated model peptide, Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) and macromolecular structures <b>of</b> hydrogels on <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> MSCs. <b>The</b> network <b>structure</b> was varied by changing {{number average molecular weight}} of PEG in OPF from 930 to 6090. The cell attachment on the peptide-modified hydrogel was increased with increasing the peptide concentration. In addition, higher molecular weight PEG compared to peptide spacer length reduced cell attachment. In vivo bone and soft tissue behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> OPF hydrogels were also assessed using a rabbit model. The results indicated that the OPF hydrogels are biocompatible as evidenced by an uniform thin circumferential fibrous capsule formation following cranial as well as subcutaneous implantation.

40|$|N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) are ionotropic {{glutamate}} receptors {{which can}} be blocked by Mg 2 + in a voltage-dependent manner and are highly permeable to Ca 2 +, hence they represent a medically relevant target for neurodegenerative disorders caused by excitotoxicity. The two main objectives of this study were, (i) to determine <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> Q/R/N, + 1 and - 8 sites modification in the M 2 pore region of GluN 2 A NMDAR subunit on Mg 2 + block and other open channel blockers; and (ii) to evaluate novel multi-target-directed ligands (MTDL) for Alzheimer’s disease therapy. The Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system was employed where NMDAR subunit cRNAs were injected into the oocytes and responses to NMDA/glycine and channel blockers were recorded using two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) electrophysiology. Pore region mutations to investigate <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> Q/R/N and adjacent sites were characterized using Mg 2 +, memantine, MK- 801, philanthotoxin analogues and an MTDL compound, CR 18. NN at the Q/R/N and + 1 sites in GluN 2 A subunits were mutated to GR and RR, while W at the - 8 position (in relation to the Q/R/N site), was mutated to N. Wild type and mutated GluN 2 A were co-expressed with GluN 1 - 1 a in Xenopus oocytes and antagonistic responses by channel blockers were recorded with TEVC. At - 75 mV, the RR mutation significantly increased IC 50 s of Mg 2 +, memantine and MK- 801 by 27 -, 42 - and 325 -fold respectively, compared to wild-type. As for the GR mutation, IC 50 s were also significantly increased for memantine and MK- 801 by 5 - and 132 -fold respectively, compared to wild type. W to N mutation at the - 8 position did not significantly affect blocking potencies for all channel blockers. Blocking potency for PhTX- 343 was not significantly altered by any mutations. This study provided evidence that <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> G and R at the Q/R/N and + 1 sites are likely responsible for the changes in blocking sensitivity and play important roles in ion permeability. The fact that PhTX- 343 remained potent despite the mutations suggest that this compound might have a different mode of action or different binding site other than the M 2 region and should be further characterized. In the MTDL study, twenty one novel compounds were tested on GluN 1 - 1 a/GluN 2 A NMDAR subunits. Thirteen were memantine-derivatives (MAB) incorporated with antioxidant moieties, three were spermine-derived polyamines also incorporated with antioxidants, and five were combinatorial forms of donepezil and carvedilol. <b>The</b> antagonistic properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compounds were tested electrophysiologically at - 60 mV and compared with Mg 2 + and memantine. The MAB series {{were found to be}} weak NMDAR channel blockers suggesting <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> memantine functionality due to <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antioxidant <b>structure</b> to its amine group. Subsequently, modification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linker point to memantine moieties to free its amine group eventually resulted in weaker NMDAR channel blockers with IC 50 s of more than 100 µM. The spermine-derived polyamines (CR compounds) were potent NMDAR blockers with IC 50 s (0. 69 to 2. 35 µM) comparable to memantine (2. 28 µM) and significantly lower than Mg 2 + (10. 1 µM) and also exhibited voltage-dependence block. Our mutation study revealed that CR 18, the most potent MTDL compound was less sensitive in NMDAR containing GR or RR mutation in GluN 2 A subunits. This is a favourable property of an NMDAR blocker for potential Alzheimer’s disease treatment since GluN 3 subunits containing GR or RR at the Q/R/N and + 1 sites are less permeable to Ca 2 + influx and has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} immobilise biomolecules on solid {{surfaces}} whilst retaining their function is <b>the</b> foundation <b>of</b> microarrays, biosensors and other miniaturised assays that provide convenient ways of analysing binding reactions of molecules with their ligands. The stability, sensitivity, cost {{and ease of}} use are important considerations when designing these systems, with <b>the</b> immobilisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biomolecule to a surface being the key to success. Miniaturised assays can allow multiplex analysis of various samples from protein interactions, carbohydrate recognition events, DNA hybridisation and cell immobilisation. They can enable fast, high-throughput and efficient testing for diagnostics, environmental testing and research purposes, as well as enabling production of whole-cell arrays to tissue engineering. The drive to miniaturisation and integration has advanced the need for effective and stable <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> biomolecules to solid surfaces which allow high probe density and high signal to noise ratio whilst maintaining <b>the</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecule. KODE™ technology is a surface engineering technology that enables modification of a cell or virion surface without causing harm. This is achieved with Function-Spacer-Lipid (FSL) constructs that embed into the membrane. They contain a functional head group that conveys a desirable attribute to the cell or virion, which include carbohydrate or peptide antigens, fluorescent markers, whole proteins or useful molecules for attachment, e. g. biotin. This research set out to determine if FSL constructs could modify non-biological surfaces as well as biological ones. <b>The</b> aims <b>of</b> this research were to establish whether FSL constructs could be attached to non-biological surfaces, and if so what <b>the</b> mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> and <b>the</b> limitations might be and what methods could be used to deliver the molecules to the surface. Inkjet printing was investigated as the primary delivery method, as it is becoming a popular approach to apply biological molecules to surfaces. It is a non-contact, precise, flexible and fast technique which lends itself well to this field where precise patterning, sample and waste volume and cost are important factors. The water soluble advantages of FSL constructs make their use as a “bioink” attractive and this method proved to be successful at applying FSLs to surfaces. FSL constructs were successfully applied to various surfaces including papers, polymers, metals, modified cellulose materials and natural fibres. All surfaces were able to attach the FSLs. <b>The</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attachment</b> was shown to be unchanged after 8 months at room temperature. Some detergents and solvents were able to remove the FSLs from the surface, indicating particular limitations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attachment.</b> Variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FSL <b>structure</b> gave insights into the attachment mechanisms which indicated that <b>the</b> amphiphilic nature <b>of</b> these constructs is important, with hydrophobic forces causing adsorption of these constructs onto solid surfaces. Investigations into possible applications of FSL modified surfaces included mapping monoclonal antibodies against different blood group antigens, assessing disease markers in solid phase and attaching recombinant proteins to surfaces. The surface selected as optimal for bioassays was paper due to low background staining and high sensitivity when used in immunoassays. FSL constructs appear to allow orientated immobilisation of biomolecules, spaced away from the surface. Good correlation to serological results using the same constructs was observed, indicating the solid phase FSL assays can provide accurate results. Cells and kodecytes were also shown to be immobilised onto solid surfaces through FSL attachment. Through linker molecules, red blood cells were attached to microspheres, paper, plastic and other surfaces which themselves were modified with FSLs. This is a potential novel method for producing cellular arrays, cellular bandages and for other applications needing precise <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> cells. Further research will reveal other types of cells able to be used in this way. In summary it was discovered that FSL constructs were able to modify non-biological surfaces with carbohydrate antigens, peptide markers and biotin, adding functionality {{to a wide variety of}} surfaces. This now opens up the potential to use FSLs as a universal surface modification technology by providing a fast, simple and easily controlled approach for biomolecule immobilisation...|$|R
