He relates how Erik outwitted all foes with clever tricks and became the {{counselor}} of Fróði son of Fridleif, king of Denmark. Erik's expeditions on Fróði's behalf <b>always</b> <b>went</b> well because of Erik's cunning and way with words. Erik finally married Fróði's sister Gunvara and Erik's elder half-brother Rollerus (Roller) was made king of Norway.|$|E

Travelling next to Constantinople, he spent many years in the Varangian Guard; [...] "and was thought to be the most valiant in all deeds that try a man, and <b>always</b> <b>went</b> next to those in the forefront."

500|$|In {{his first}} {{appearance}} in 1977, he used a Gibson Ripper only for the [...] "Let There Be Rock" [...] music video. Cliff Williams' trademark instrument is the StingRay and other basses by Music Man, strung with D'Addario (.045, [...]065, [...]085, [...]105) flatwounds {{in the studio and}} roundwound XLs in concert. Williams states that despite trying other basses over the years, he <b>always</b> <b>went</b> back to Music Man's instruments, which he described as [...] "a tremendous work horse of a bass". Other basses used include the Fender Precision Bass, a Gibson Thunderbird non-reverse, Fender Jazz Bass, the Steinberger L-series, a Gibson EB-3 and at least two LAG Custom basses. Williams used 3 Ampeg SVT-810E cabinets with 2 SVT-4PRO Heads, but if there was any interference with the wireless systems, he used cables in his live performances.|$|E

500|$|Fincher, Fischer and Vanderbilt {{spent months}} {{interviewing}} witnesses, {{family members of}} suspects, retired and current investigators, the only two surviving victims, and the mayors of San Francisco and Vallejo. Fincher said, [...] "Even when we did our own interviews, we would talk to two people. [...] One would confirm some aspects of it and another would deny it. Plus, so much time had passed, memories are affected and the different telling of the stories would change perception. So when there was any doubt we <b>always</b> <b>went</b> with the police reports". During {{the course of their}} research, Fincher and Fischer hired Gerald McMenamin, an internationally known forensic linguistics expert and professor of linguistics at California State University Fresno, to analyze the Zodiac's letters. Unlike document examiners in the 1970s, he focused on the language of the Zodiac and how he formed his sentences in terms of word structure and spelling.|$|E

Mindful of the Pan-Islamic propaganda of the Ottomans who proclaimed a jihad against the Allies in 1914, Allenby himself discouraged the use of the crusader imagery, banned his press officers from using the terms crusade and crusader in their press releases and <b>always</b> <b>went</b> {{out of his way to}} insist that he was fighting merely the Ottoman Empire, not Islam.|$|E

Although he is seen driving various cars himself in the series, he always has a driver - usually 'Bill' (an uncredited role played by Tony Allen) - when using the Consul Granada (and the similar Ford Granada models used in later stories), which served as a Squad car: when the Squad travelled they <b>always</b> <b>went</b> [...] "mob handed" [...] (in considerable numbers). Regan did have his own car outside of the squad, in the series.|$|E
2500|$|She {{traveled}} extensively {{well into}} old age. In 1966 and 1969, she undertook two long journeys to Mexico, becoming {{fascinated by the}} indigenous culture {{of the country and}} its mestizo population. She stayed with actor Romney Brent in Mexico City and with Katherine (Kit) Wright, a long-time friend, in Cuernavaca. She collected a large number of travel impressions and wrote tens of thousands of words for a [...] "follow-up" [...] volume to Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, tentatively titled [...] "Survivors in Mexico." [...] The work, however, was never finished, and only saw publication posthumously in 2003. Even into her late 70s, she visited Lebanon, Venice, Monte Carlo, and <b>always</b> <b>went</b> back to the United States.|$|E

But as soon as Shirley came on board she simplified the lyrics so that they were a lot more subtle and worked better as songs." [...] Manson detailed that regarding the previous song sketches, [...] "some of the ideas for lyrics I found unsuitable, and others I liked and worked on with them. I <b>always</b> <b>went</b> to bat for what I believed in." [...] She added that because [...] "the lyrics take a while to work on" [...] bandmates would give suggestions and she included the ones that fancied her.|$|E

Test cricket was not filmed except for highlights {{and the notion of}} Test umpires using slow-motion replays or other modern techniques would have been considered absurd. Instead the umpires had to make judgements based on what they saw in a split-second, and honest mistakes were accepted as {{part and parcel of the}} game.

2500|$|Frank Stewart Farrar (28 June 1916 [...] 7 February 2000), who <b>always</b> <b>went</b> by {{the name}} of Stewart Farrar, was an English screenwriter, novelist and {{prominent}} figure in the Neopagan religion of Wicca, which he devoted much of his later life to propagating with the aid of his seventh wife, Janet Farrar, and then his friend Gavin Bone as well. A devout communist in early life, he worked as a reporter for such newspapers as the Soviet Weekly and the Daily Worker, and also served in the British army during the Second World War. He was responsible for writing episodes for such television series as Dr. Finlay's Casebook, Armchair Theatre and Crossroads, and for his work in writing radio scripts won a Writer's Guild Award. He also published a string of novels, written in such disparate genres as crime, romance and fantasy.|$|E
2500|$|Demetriade {{continued}} to play the unconventional poet, well-integrated in {{the atmosphere of the}} era's literary cafes. He embraced the peculiar lifestyle of literary bohemia. Writing in 1902, Macedonski described him as a [...] "jester" [...] who could prove himself [...] "bitter", also noting that Demetriade's day started [...] "at 3 o'clock in the afternoon". Such depictions were puzzling for the reading public, who wondered whether Macedonski was not in fact mocking his disciple. However, Demetriade remained among the most loyal Macedonskians, to 1904 and beyond. The younger Symbolist Mihail Cruceanu, who met Demetriade in Macedonski's salon in 1905, recalls him as a [...] "Mefisto", who readily imparted his erotic escapades with the Literatorul crowd. He notes: [...] "We the young ones we were looking up to him with much curiosity and sympathy, as he appeared to us as an elegant and fortunate satyr whose astuteness we could never match. But seeing as we were fatigued by the stories' emotionalism, we left for home at midnight, leaving him alone with his complete menu, to consume till dawn. Or so they tell me, since I, the aspiring poet, <b>always</b> <b>went</b> to bed before that time." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Stalin's stroke, Beria {{claimed to}} have killed him. This aborted a final purge of Old Bolsheviks Mikoyan and Molotov, for which Stalin had been laying the groundwork in the year prior to his death. Shortly after Stalin's death, Beria {{announced}} triumphantly to the Politburo that he had [...] "done [...] in" [...] and [...] "saved [...] all", according to Molotov's memoirs. Notably, Beria never explicitly stated whether he had initiated Stalin's stroke or had merely delayed his treatment in the hope he would die (as argued by Sebag-Montefiore). Support for the assertion that Stalin was poisoned with warfarin by Beria's associates has been presented from several sources, including Edvard Radzinsky in his biography Stalin and {{a recent study by}} Miguel A. Faria in the journal Surgical Neurology International [...] Warfarin (4-Hydroxycoumarins) is cited as the likely agent; it would have produced the symptoms reported, and administering it into Stalin's food or drink was well within the operational abilities of Beria's NKVD. Sebag-Montefiore does not dispute the possibility of an assassination by poison masterminded by Beria, whose hatred for Stalin was palpable by this point, but also notes that Beria never made mention of poison or confessed to using it, even during his later interrogations, and was never alone with Stalin during the period prior to his stroke (he <b>always</b> <b>went</b> with Malenkov to defer suspicion).|$|E
2500|$|Short {{spent part}} of each year, from 1889 until 1893, in Chicago. He usually went there {{during the summer months}} to get relief from the Texas heat as well as to attend {{thoroughbred}} horse races. Hattie <b>always</b> <b>went</b> with him on these extended visits that often lasted weeks and sometimes months. The Shorts always stayed at the Leland Hotel on Michigan Avenue. In July 1889, Short was among the party going from Chicago to New Orleans in a private railway car to attend a prize fight. Short was described by a reporter as [...] "the noted sporting man of Fort Worth," [...] who was [...] "not interested in the fight ... but will go because his friend 'Bat' Masterson insists on his doing so." [...] Short explained to the reporter that he would [...] "go anywhere in the world for Bat." [...] Short and Masterson went from New Orleans to Richburg, Mississippi, where they were ringside at the John L. Sullivan – Jake Kilrain championship fight on July 8, 1889. Bat Masterson was not there merely to observe the action; he was the designated timekeeper for Kilrain. Reportedly Short, Johnny Murphy, and [...] "twelve other good men were scattered around the ring side where they would do the most good in case of an emergency." [...] Short's return to Chicago on July 12, 1889 was noted by several newspapers in the city. He had returned from Richburg with a new enthusiasm for boxing, along with an ambition to become a boxing promoter.|$|E
2500|$|In {{this period}} Lisbon {{was a poor}} and dirty city {{compared}} to the cities of northern Europe. Almost all its commercial importance derived from the monopoly it held on {{the products of the}} Portuguese colonies, especially Angola and Mozambique. The country itself was described in London, Paris and Berlin as an extension of North Africa, meaning a territory unable to govern itself. The first large-scale emigrations began, and many thousands of poor Lisbons departed for Brazil, not to take government administrative jobs, but rather to rise from the lower levels of the Portuguese social scale: Despite the poverty and backwardness of most of the country, a rich upper class rose in Lisbon which spent lavishly and behaved as if it belonged to the elite of northern Europe, while governing a rural and backward country crippled by economic protectionism, and lacking systems to provide state-funded education and health care. With the decreasing importance of land as a factor of wealth, the landed aristocracy and gentry orbited the royal court, living luxuriously on allowances and salaries distributed by the state using taxes collected from the middle and lower classes. A regime [...] "of genteel manners" [...] was established which ceased political persecution, but also halted any reforms; corruption was routine and almost <b>always</b> <b>went</b> unpunished. Occasionally, an exceptional politician who was amenable to change and willing to invest time and effort to bring it about would appear in the succession of mostly idle and corrupt administrators. The Prime Minister Fontes Pereira de Melo reacted against protectionism and fought for economic liberalization and expanded industrialisation; various economic and industrial developments were encouraged under his leadership, which was focused primarily on the development of infrastructure.|$|E

2500|$|The Harper {{government}} reversed many {{of these}} positions, re-establishing traditional Canadian support for Israel as a beleaguered democracy. In United Nations votes related to Israel, the Palestinians, and related issues, which almost <b>always</b> <b>went</b> against Israel, reflecting the large bloc of votes from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Canada generally joined the US, Israel, Australia {{and a few other}} countries in principled opposition. PM Harper also announced that Canada would not participate in the Durban Review Conference, and that, in contrast to the antisemitic NGO Forum {{that took place in the}} initial conference in 2001, no Canadian taxpayer funds would be spent in support of this event, which was again expected to be exploited by radical groups for anti-Israel campaigning. In a joint statement, ministers Bernier and Kenney noted that the original 2001 Durban conference [...] "degenerated into open and divisive expressions of intolerance and antisemitism that undermined the principles of the United Nations and the very goals the conference sought to achieve.” Although they [...] "hoped that the preparatory process for the 2009 Durban Review Conference would remedy the mistakes of the past", the evidence showed that [...] "the process was too flawed to make the conference worthwhile." [...] Similarly, Harper declared that “Canada will not lend its name and reputation to an international conference that promotes ... scapegoating the Jewish people.” He added that Canada “will participate in any international conference that combats racism. We will not, however, lend Canada’s good name to those, such as Durban II, that promote it.” When evidence surfaced that the framework known as Rights and Democracy, which was funded by government budgets, had defied this policy, an investigation was undertaken, and in 2012, the organization was shut down.|$|E
