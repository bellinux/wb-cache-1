5|$|The Sky Harbor Expressway {{was a small}} {{remnant of}} the old {{northern}} alignment of Route 143. Beginning at Washington St., the former expressway headed south, under the Union Pacific Railroad, to an interchange with the airport entrance, before a bridge over the Salt River parallel to <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few hundred {{feet away from the}} bridge on Route 143. The former expressway then ended at University Avenue with no further planned extension to Interstate 10.|$|E
5|$|The first {{attestation}} of the Latin term {{is attributed}} to a charter of Duke Trpimir from the year 852. The original is lost, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> 1568 copy is preserved, leading to doubts over {{the authenticity of the}} claim. The oldest preserved stone inscription is the 9th-century Branimir Inscription found near Benkovac, where Duke Branimir is styled as Dux Cruatorvm. The inscription is not believed to be dated accurately, but is likely to be from during the period of 879–892, during Branimir's rule.|$|E

5|$|Nicolls {{retired from}} the Royal Marines, and was given the {{substantive}} rank of lieutenant colonel, on 15 May 1835. On 3 November 1840, he received the brevet British Army rank of colonel, postdated to 10 January 1837. He was awarded a good-service pension of £150 per annum on 30 June 1842. On 9 November 1846 {{he was promoted to}} the brevet Army rank of major general, in June 1854 he was advanced to lieutenant general, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> year later in June 1855 he was promoted to full general.

5|$|Shortly {{before it}} {{opened to the}} public, the C gave notice of its {{intention}} to submit another private bill to Parliament, to construct a new line from its northern terminus at King William Street towards Islington. Because of the awkward arrangement of King William Street station, the extension {{was not to be}} connected directly to the existing running tunnels but was to be linked via a pedestrian subway through which passengers could make interchanges between the separate lines. The bill was rejected {{on the grounds that the}} extension failed to make a connection to the existing line. In November 1891, the C published details of a revised bill for the extension to Islington. The company had recognised the deficiencies of its King William Street station <b>and,</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> year after the line had opened, planned to construct a new pair of tunnels to bypass the problematic northern section.|$|E
5|$|After Dernancourt, the 48th Battalion {{marched to}} the rear and began {{establishing}} a reserve line at Beaucourt. On 18 April, Gellibrand was evacuated sick and Leane was appointed to act as brigade commander in his place. The following day he was temporarily promoted {{to the rank of}} colonel. During Gellibrand's absence, on 27–28 April the 12th Brigade was deployed to the line at Villers-Bretonneux, which had just been recaptured from the Germans. In order to push the frontline further east of the town, it was necessary to capture strongly-held German positions in Monument Wood, so-named as it was adjacent to a memorial to the Franco-Prussian War. This task was given to the 12th Brigade, and Leane, knowing that the fighting would be difficult, applied his usual practice of giving the most challenging missions to his own, the 48th Battalion. After the intense fighting at Dernancourt, the 48th had been reinforced with a significant number of unseasoned new recruits. The attack was planned for 02:00 on 3 May, and in order to achieve surprise, there was to be only intermittent shelling of the wood during the day, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> two minute barrage with all available guns {{at the time of the}} attack. In the event, Leane's first battle as brigade commander went badly, with the artillery barrage being very weak and failing to cut the wire in front of the wood, and the supporting tanks failing to have any impact. One party managed to get through the wire and capture 21 Germans in the farm buildings in the centre of the wood, but a German counterattack forced the Australians back to their start line, with a loss of 12 officers and 143 other ranks, against German casualties of 10 officers and 136 men.|$|E

25|$|Construction of {{a church}} on the site began in 1850, {{commissioned}} by Bishop James Alipius Goold. Building was delayed by the furore of the Gold rush.
