50|$|The {{effect is}} of {{considerable}} industrial importance {{in terms of}} both safety and potential damage to manufactured goods. Static discharge is a particular hazard in grain elevators owing to the danger of a dust explosion. The spark produced is fully able to ignite flammable vapours, for example, petrol, ether fumes as well as methane gas. For bulk fuel deliveries and <b>aircraft</b> <b>fueling</b> a grounding connection is made between the vehicle and the receiving tank prior to opening the tanks.

50|$|On 2 May, Thrush {{arrived at}} Quonset Point, Rhode Island, to begin {{training}} operations which lasted through the summer. Engaged in antisubmarine drills, the seaplane tender towed targets for dive-bomber practices; retrieved practice torpedoes; and acted as an escort for R class submarines engaged in training exercises with aircraft. Upon completion of this duty, the ship moved south and made port at Norfolk on 9 August for availability which lasted through 11 September. Heading further south, Thrush {{took part in}} the dismantling of naval air bases at Almirante Bay, Panama, and at Moneypenny Anchorage, Nicaragua. She then deployed to Baltra Island in the Galápagos group during November and returned to Panamanian waters in December. Operating in the Panama Canal Zone through January 1944, Thrush subsequently carried a U.S. Army surveying party to the Cocos Islands and to the Honduran coast in March before towing a Navy oil barge back to Panama. From April through September, the ship participated in submarine training exercises off Key West, Florida, and towed targets for submarines and aircraft before putting into the Norfolk Navy Yard for availability. Following repairs, she headed south, via Trinidad, to Surinam and arrived at Paramaribo on 19 November. She anchored off the mouth of the Surinam River and commenced tending Martin PBM's—a duty which lasted through March 1945, punctuated briefly by an inspection at Trinidad. Subsequently, Thrush returned to the routine operations of beaching and repairing <b>aircraft,</b> <b>fueling</b> them, and feeding their crews. Acting also as a floating radio station, the seaplane tender continued these duties from her return from Trinidad on 24 March to 4 June.|$|E

40|$|Airports {{will face}} {{congestion}} problems due to increasing air traffic. Since airport expansion {{is not always}} possible, other solutions must be found. One solution could be to make better use of the parties at an airport. Ground handling parties are an example of parties at an airport. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>fueling,</b> passenger boarding and cleaning of an aircraft are examples of ground handling processes, which are performed by ground handling parties. This thesis focuses on replanning of ground handling processes. The original ground handling process plan is modeled as a Simple Temporal Problem. By solving the Temporal Decoupling Problem for a given plan, the plan is split into several independent subplans, each subplan represents {{a plan for a}} service provider. Whenever an aircraft is delayed or one of the ground handling processes is disturbed, the current plan may become infeasible. Subsequently, repair algorithms have to be applied to repair the broken plan. The main contribution of this thesis is to propose repair algorithms for a ground handling process plan, modeled as a decoupled Simple Temporal Problem.

40|$|In 1981, NIOSH began {{investigating}} the potential reproductive health effects resulting from exposures {{to a class}} of organic solvents known generically as glycol ethers (GE). This research was begun {{as a result of}} the NIOSH criteria document development program which revealed little data available on the health effects of glycol ether exposure. Ibxicologic research was begun by NIOSH and other researchers which suggested substantial reproductive effects in animals. These animal data motivated a study of human exposures in the occupational setting. In 1981 and 1982 NIOSH conducted several walk-through surveys which included preliminary measurements of exposures in a variety of industries including painting trades, coal mining, production blending and distribution facilities, <b>aircraft</b> <b>fueling,</b> and communications equipment repair facilities. The human exposure data from these surveys is summarized in this paper with most results well below 1 parts per million (ppm) and only a few values approaching 10 ppm. Blood samples were collected at one site resulting in GE concentrations below the limit of detection. Exposures to airborne glycol ethers, in the industries investigated during the collection of this data, revealed several problems in reliably sampling GE at low concentrations. It became apparent, from the data and observations of work practices, that air monitoring alone provided an inadequate index of GE exposure. Further field studies of exposure to GE are anticipated, pending location of additional groups o...|$|E
40|$|Brewer Environmental Services (BES) {{successfully}} completed a site investigation and initiated remediation of a JP- 4 release at an <b>aircraft</b> <b>fueling</b> ramp in Yokota, Japan. This project was unique {{due to the}} location, redmedial approach selected and depth at which MPX (bioslurping was applied) A pilot study was not funded so the remedial approach chosen had {{to allow for a}} variety of possible field conditions. The design criteria for the system was to remove the JP- 4 layer floating on top of and dissolved in the shallow aquifer groundwater: remove the vapor phase JP- 4 compounds in the vadose zone; provide a cleanup system with the most flexibility, easiest maintenance, and least impact to facility operations BES selected and with CARBTROL, Inc., designed a containerized Multiphase Extraction (MPX) system. The MPX system is designed to recover jet fuel in liquid, vapor and dissolved (in groundwater) phases via vacuum-pumping which utilizes a high vacuum liquid ring pump. Currently, JP- 4 constituents are recovered from a depth of 50 feet in the nine wells using MPX. BES designed an innovative MPX wellhead which consists of multiple valving, multiple sampling ports, an extraction tube and a unique gasketed coupler. The wellhead design allows for the extraction tube to be adjusted to any length in the field to extract any combination of phases. A system for dynamic determination of water level was also developed. The containerized MPX approach allows the system to be shippable and modified to any set of phases that hydrocarbon contamination can be found, thereby reducing the impact by passing a pilot study phase. Simplicity of the single pump design means that all maintenance quipment are in the system – not downhole.
