5|$|The {{resident}} supercargo {{was responsible}} for buying goods such as tea, porcelain, silk, <b>arrack,</b> sago and miscellaneous for the next ship arriving from Sweden. The SOIC traded mainly with the Chinese merchant Puankhequa, who had his factory next to the Swedish, and judging from their letters, Puankhequa and Grill became friends. Grill was entrusted with funds from the SOIC for buying tea and other goods during off-season when the price was at its lowest. He bought most of the tea from Puankhequa, and several contracts are preserved. However, he did not buy the tea from the Chinese merchant on the SOIC's behalf but instead bought it through his own company and sold {{it on to the}} SOIC at a slightly higher price. After some time the SOIC became suspicious and director David Sandberg was sent to Canton to investigate the matter in 1766. Grill and his companions, Grubb and Hahr, had to sign an agreement not to misuse their position within the SOIC. In 1768, Grill was ordered to return home as supercargo on the ship Cron Prins Gustaf. Even so, Hahr stayed behind in Canton, continued their business and was able to transfer Grill's share of the profit through international bank notes.|$|E
25|$|In 1798, Oiseau {{served in}} the Indian Ocean, where she {{captured}} the French Réunion on 1 September. On 21 April 1799 her boats went into Saint Denis on the Íle de Bourbon and cut out two merchant vessels, Denree, which had a cargo of bale goods and coffee, and Augustine, which had a cargo of rum and <b>arrack.</b> Augustine was lost in St. Augustine's Bay.|$|E
25|$|Trade with Europeans was lively in {{the seventeenth}} century. In fact European merchants traded their goods, mainly modern arms such as rifles and cannons, with local {{products}} from the inland jungle such as sapan (lit. bridge) woods, deerskin and rice. Tomé Pires, a Portuguese voyager, mentioned {{in the sixteenth century}} that Ayutthaya, or Odia, was rich in good merchandise. Most of the foreign merchants coming to Ayutthaya were European and Chinese, and were taxed by the authorities. The kingdom had an abundance of rice, salt, dried fish, <b>arrack</b> and vegetables.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 March Fataslem, an English {{ship that}} Malartic had {{captured}} on 25 December 1799, arrived at Mauritius. She {{was carrying a}} cargo of [...] "calin", pepper, sago, <b>arrack,</b> etc.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{pronunciation}} varies {{depending on}} local varieties of Arabic: , [...] Arak {{is not to be}} confused with the similarly named liquor, <b>arrack</b> (which in some cases, such as in Indonesia—especially Bali, also goes by the name arak). Another similar-sounding word is , which in Armenia, Iran, Azerbaijan and Georgia is the colloquial name of vodka, and not an aniseed-flavored drink. Rakı, mastika, and ouzo are aniseed-flavored alcoholic drinks, related to arak, popular in Turkey, [...] Macedonia, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Greece respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{the roots}} of Aitken Spence can be dated back to Wilson & Archer Partnership of the 1830s in the early British Colonial Ceylon, the company began to take its current form after the signing of a formal {{partnership}} agreement between Thomas Clark and Patrick Gordon Spence—Scottish merchants and shipping agents in Galle—on 1 September 1868, wherein Clark Spence & Co. was established. Clark Spence & Co.'s trading segment at this stage included exports of natural vein graphite (plumbago), gems, hides, Sappan wood, ebony, coffee, coconut oil, coir yarn, bristle fibre, <b>arrack,</b> [...] and citronella oil to United Kingdom, Continental Europe, United States of America and Australia; and imports of Burmese rice and coal for steamer ship bunkers.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{trade was}} [...] by barter. Paddy {{was the most}} {{commonly}} accepted medium of exchange, followed by purified salt. Honey and roots were exchanged for fish liver oil and <b>arrack,</b> while sugarcane and rice flakes were traded for venison and toddy. Poems in Purananuru describe the prosperous house in Pandya land [...] well stocked with paddy that the housewife had exchanged for grams and fish. Artisans and professionals traded their services for goods. Quantities were measured by weighing balance, called the Tulakkol named after Tulam, the standard weight. Delicate balances made of ivory were used by the goldsmiths for measures of Urai, Nali and Ma. A different kind of barter involving deferred exchange was known as Kuri edirppai [...] this involved taking a loan for a fixed quantity of a commodity to be repaid by the same quantity of the same commodity at a later date. Since barter was prevalent locally, coins were used almost exclusively for foreign trade.|$|E
60|$|They were {{replenished}} {{with both}} meat and drink; the trenchers readily accessible {{by means of}} cords; but the gourds containing <b>arrack,</b> suspended neck downward, were within easy reach where they swung.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. The returns {{that are}} {{injurious}} to our manufactures, or growth {{of our own}} country, are printed calicoes, chintz, wrought silks, stuffs, of herbs and barks, block-tin, sugar, cotton, <b>arrack,</b> copper, and indigo.|$|E
60|$|The {{doctor had}} his {{employment}} all this while, {{as well as}} William and the old captain, for he went on shore {{several times a day}} in the Indian boat, and brought fresh provisions for the sloop, which the men had need enough of. He brought, in particular, seventeen large casks of <b>arrack,</b> as big as butts, besides smaller quantities, a quantity of rice, and abundance of fruits, mangoes, pompions, and such things, with fowls and fish. He never came on board but he was deep laden; for, in short, he bought for the ship as well as for themselves; and, particularly, they half-loaded the ship with rice and <b>arrack,</b> with some hogs, and six or seven cows, alive; and thus, being well victualled, and having directions for coming again, they returned to us.|$|E
60|$|Not to gainsay the truth, we fancied the Morando much. A nutty, pungent flavor it had; {{like some}} kinds of <b>arrack</b> {{distilled}} in the Philippine isles. And a marvelous effect did it have, in dissolving the crystalization of the brain; leaving nothing but precious little drops of good humor, beading round the bowl of the cranium.|$|E
60|$|The villagers {{and their}} guests {{were still in}} the midst of the feast, and the <b>arrack</b> had not yet begun to stimulate their imaginations, so that the deeds of their ancestors--which formed the chief subject of conversation--were still being recounted with some regard to modesty and truth, when Voalavo said to the assemblage, with a beaming countenance, that he had a treat in store for them.|$|E
60|$|We stored {{ourselves}} likewise with {{oranges and}} lemons; and, buying a great quantity {{of very good}} limes, we made three or four hogsheads of lime-juice, which was a great relief to our men in the hot season, to mix with their water; as for making punch, we had some <b>arrack</b> and some sugar, but neither of them in such quantity as to have much punch made afore the mast.|$|E
60|$|As to the rice, {{they gave}} us six hundred bushels, which they had {{actually}} on board, together with a parcel shipped upon freight. Also, {{they gave us}} thirty middling casks of very good <b>arrack,</b> but beef and pork they had none. However, they went on shore with our men, and bought eleven bullocks and fifty hogs, which were pickled up for our occasion; and upon the supplies of provision from shore, we dismissed them and their ship.|$|E
60|$|Money {{is unknown}} and valueless here--knives, cloth, and <b>arrack</b> forming the only medium of exchange, with tobacco for small coin. Every {{transaction}} {{is the subject}} of a special bargain, and the cause of much talking. It is absolutely necessary to offer very little, as the natives are never satisfied till you add a little more. They are then far better pleased than if you had given them twice the amount at first and refused to increase it.|$|E
60|$|When {{the captain}} came on board, we demanded {{an account of}} their cargo, which was chiefly bales of goods from Bengal for Bantam. We told them our present want was provisions, which they had no need of, being just {{at the end of}} their voyage; and that, if they would send their boat on shore with ours, and procure us six-and-twenty head of black cattle, threescore hogs, a {{quantity}} of brandy and <b>arrack,</b> and three hundred bushels of rice, we would let them go free.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said Larry, talking {{through his}} nose, as usual, [...] "in Madagasky there, they don't wear any togs at all, {{nothing but a}} bowline round the midships; they don't have no dinners, but keeps a dinin' all day off fat pigs and dogs; they don't go to bed any where, but keeps a noddin' all the time; and they gets drunk, too, from some first rate <b>arrack</b> they make from cocoa-nuts; and smokes plenty of 'baccy, too, I tell ye. Fine country, that! Blast Ameriky, I say!" ...|$|E
60|$|The first {{object of}} the march was Fort Augustus, which he {{intended}} to make his central post. As he advanced he was met by Captain Swetenham, who informed him of the raising of the standard and the gathering he had witnessed. As, however, only Locheil's clansmen had arrived before Swetenham left, Cope considered his force ample for the purpose, and continued his march. In order to reach Fort Augustus, however, he had to pass over Corry <b>Arrack,</b> a lofty and precipitous mountain which was ascended by a military road with fifteen zigzags, known to the country as the devil's staircase.|$|E
60|$|This {{being the}} most {{convenient}} station whence to ascend Paras-nath, we started at 6 a.m. for the village of Maddaobund, at the north base of the mountain, or opposite side from that on which the grand trunk-road runs. After following the latter for a few miles to the west, we took a path through beautifully wooded plains, with scattered trees of the Mahowa (Bassia latifolia), resembling good oaks: the natives distil a kind of <b>arrack</b> from its fleshy flowers, which are also eaten raw. The seeds, too, yield a concrete oil, by expression, which is used for lamps and occasionally for frying.|$|E
60|$|The chief {{luxury of}} the Aru people, besides betel and tobacco, is <b>arrack</b> (Java rum), which the traders bring in great {{quantities}} and sell very cheap. A day's fishing or rattan cutting will purchase {{at least a}} half-gallon bottle; and when the tripang or birds' nests collected during a season are sold, they get whole boxes, each containing fifteen such bottles, which the inmates of a house will sit round day and night till they have finished. They themselves tell me that at such bouts they often tear to pieces the house they are in, break and destroy everything they can lay their hands on, and make such an infernal riot as is alarming to behold.|$|E
60|$|We were in {{the lighted}} Grove again, and sitting down to a supper of Vauxhall fare: {{transparent}} slices of ham (which had been a Vauxhall joke for ages), and chickens and cheese cakes and champagne and claret, and <b>arrack</b> punch. Mr. Tyers extended the concert in our favour. Mrs. Weichsell and the beautiful Baddeley trilled sentimental ballads which our ladies chose; and Mr. Vernon, the celebrated tenor, sang Cupid's Recruiting Sergeant so happily that Storer sent him a bottle of champagne. After which we amused ourselves with catches until the space between our boxes and the orchestra was filled. In {{the midst of this}} Comyn came quietly in from the other box and took a seat beside me.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the most}} {{surprising}} things connected with Aru was the excessive cheapness of all articles of European or native manufacture. We were here two thousand miles beyond Singapore and Batavia, which are themselves emporiums of the [...] "far east," [...] in a place unvisited by, and almost unknown to, European traders; everything reached us through {{at least two or}} three hands, often many more; yet English calicoes and American cotton cloths could be bought for 8s. the piece, muskets for 15s., common scissors and German knives at three-halfpence each, and other cutlery, cotton goods, and earthenware in the same proportion. The natives of this out-of-the-way country can, in fact, buy all these things at about the same money price as our workmen at home, but in reality very much cheaper, for the produce of a few hours' labour enables the savage to purchase in abundance what are to him luxuries, while to the European they are necessaries of life. The barbarian is no happier and no better off for this cheapness. On the contrary, it has a most injurious effect on him. He wants the stimulus of necessity to force him to labour; and if iron were as dear as silver, and calico as costly as satin, the effect would be beneficial to him. As it is, he has more idle hours, gets a more constant supply of tobacco, and can intoxicate himself with <b>arrack</b> more frequently and more thoroughly; for your Aru man scorns to get half drunk-a tumbler full of <b>arrack</b> is but a slight stimulus, and nothing less than half a gallon of spirit will make him tipsy to his own satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|In {{some parts}} of this island of Madagascar, as {{in other parts of}} the world, the people reduced {{themselves}} to great poverty through strong drink. Though they had abundance of rice, and much beef, which latter was salted for exportation, they sold so much of their food for arrack-- imported by traders from Mauritius and Bourbon--that little was left for the bare maintenance of life, and they, with their families, were often compelled to subsist on roots. They did not understand [...] "moderate drinking"! Intoxication was the rule until the <b>arrack</b> was done. The wise King Radama the First attempted to check the consumption of ardent spirits by imposing a heavy duty on them, but his efforts were only partially successful.|$|E
6000|$|Montesinos.--Coffee in {{the seventeenth}} century, {{inoculation}} in that which followed; since which we have had {{now and then a}} new dance and a new game at cards, curry and mullagatawny soup from the East Indies, turtle from the West, and that earthly nectar to which the East contributes its <b>arrack,</b> and the West its limes and its rum. In the language of men it is called Punch; I know not what may be its name in the Olympian speech. But tell not the Englishmen of George the Second's age, lest they should be troubled for the degeneracy of their grandchildren, that the punchbowl is now become a relic of antiquity, and their beloved beverage almost as obsolete as metheglin, hippocras, chary, or morat! ...|$|E
60|$|When {{they came}} on board, I ordered {{they should have}} two pieces of linen wrapped round their waists to cover them, which they seemed well pleased with. We gave them also several strings of beads, and our men tied them about their necks, and about their arms like bracelets, and they were wonderfully delighted with their ornaments. Others of our men gave each of them a pair of scissors, with needles and some thread, and {{threading}} the needles, showed them how to sew with them; we also gave them food, {{and each of them}} a dram of <b>arrack,</b> and made signs to know of them where they lived; they pointed up to the river, but we could by no means understand them.|$|E
60|$|After this, we {{exchanged}} some presents of refreshments, and, particularly, {{they sent}} me a hogshead of rum, which, was very acceptable; and I sent them in return a runlet of <b>arrack,</b> excusing myself that I had no great store. I sent them also the quantity of one hundred weight of nutmegs and cloves; but the most agreeable present I sent them was twenty pieces of Madagascar dried beef, cured in the sun, the like of which {{they had never seen}} or tasted before; and without question, it is such an excellent way of curing beef, that if I were to be at Madagascar again, I would take in a sufficient quantity of beef so preserved to victual the whole ship for the voyage; and I leave it as a direction to all English seamen that have occasion to use East-India voyages.|$|E
60|$|On the 12th of May I found another, which {{behaved in}} a very similar manner, howling and hooting with rage, and {{throwing}} down branches. I shot at it five times, and it remained dead {{on the top of}} the tree, supported in a fork in such a manner that it would evidently not fall. I therefore returned home, and luckily found some Dyaks, who came back with me, and climbed up the tree for the animal. This was the first full-grown specimen I had obtained; but it was a female, and not nearly so large or remarkable as the full-grown males. It was, however, 3 ft. 6 in. high, and its arms stretched out to a width of 6 ft. 6 in. I preserved the skin of this specimen in a cask of <b>arrack,</b> and prepared a perfect skeleton, which was afterwards purchased for the Derby Museum.|$|E
60|$|Some {{time before}} {{we were ready to}} sail, I called all the warrant {{officers}} together, and told them, that as we were come to a country where abundance of small things were to be bought, and going to a country where we might possibly have an opportunity to sell them again to advantage, I would advance to every officer a hundred dollars, upon account of their pay, that they might lay it out here, and dispose of it again on the coast of New Spain to advantage. This was very acceptable to them, and they acknowledged it; and here, besides this, by the consent of all our superior officers, I gave a largess or bounty of five dollars a man, to all our foremast men; most of which I believe they laid out in <b>arrack</b> and sugar, to cheer them up {{in the rest of the}} voyage, which they all knew would be long enough.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{this the}} captain, {{who had won}} much upon {{the rest of his}} men by what he had said to them, and was very easy as to the general peace (for it was very true that the most mutinous of the men were gone), came out to the quarter-deck, and, calling the men together, let them know the {{substance}} of the letter, and told the men that, however they had not deserved such civility from him, yet he was not willing to expose them more than they were willing to expose themselves; he was inclined to send them some ammunition, and as they had desired but one barrel of powder, he would send them two barrels, and shot, or lead and moulds to make shot, in proportion; and, to let them see that he was civiller to them than they deserved, he ordered a cask of <b>arrack</b> and a great bag of bread to be sent them for subsistence till {{they should be able to}} furnish themselves.|$|E
60|$|This {{proposal}} soon got my consent, {{being very}} agreeable to my rambling genius; {{and the more}} so, because I looked upon my countryman {{to be a very}} sincere person; it required some time before we could get a vessel to our mind, and sailors to man it accordingly; at length we bought a ship, and got an English mate, boatswain, and gunner, a Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese foremast men; and, for want of others, made shift with Indian seamen. We first sailed to Achin, in the island of Sumatra, and then to Siam, where we bartered our wares for some <b>arrack</b> and opium, the last of which bore a great price among the Chinese; in a word, we went up to Suskan, making a very great voyage; &, after eight months time, I returned to Bengal, very well satisfied with this adventure, having not only got a sufficient quantity of money, but an insight of getting a great deal more.|$|E
60|$|It was scarce {{possible}} to restrain Englishmen, after so long beating the sea, from going on shore {{when they came}} to such a place of refreshment as this; nor indeed was it reasonable to restrain them, considering how we all might be supposed to stand in need of refreshment, and considering that here was no length of ground for the men to wander in, no liquors to come at to distract them with their excess, and, which was still more, no women to disorder or debauch them. We all knew their chief exercise would be hunting goats for their subsistence, and we knew also, that, however they wanted the benefit of fresh provision, they must work hard to catch it before they could taste the sweet of it. Upon these considerations, I say, our ships being well moored, and riding safe, we restrained none of them, except a proper number to take care of each ship; and those were taken out by lot, and then had their turn also to go on shore some days afterwards, and in the mean time had both fresh water and fresh meat sent them immediately, and that in sufficient quantity to their satisfaction. As soon as we were on shore, and had looked about us, we began first with getting some fresh water, for we greatly wanted it. Then carrying a small cask of <b>arrack</b> on shore, I made a quantity of it be put into a whole butt of water before I let our men drink a drop; so correcting a little the chilness of the water, because I knew they would drink an immoderate quantity, and endanger their healths, and the effect answered my care; for, those who drank at the spring where they took in the water, before I got this butt filled, and before the <b>arrack</b> was put into it, fell into swoonings and faint sweats, having gorged themselves too much with the cool water; and two or three I thought would have died, but our surgeons took such care of them, that they recovered.|$|E
60|$|They spent {{good part}} of the first day in looking about them, seeing the manner of the pirates' living there, and their strength, and soon {{perceived}} that they were indeed in but a sorry condition every way, except that they had live cattle and flesh meat sufficient. They had a good platform of guns indeed, and a covered pallisadoe round where they lodged their ammunition: but as for fortifications to the landward, they had none, except a double pallisadoe round their camp, and a sort of a bank thrown up within to fire from, and stand covered from the enemies' lances, which was all they had to fear from the natives. They had no bread but what they made of rice, and the store they had of that was very small: they told our men, indeed, that they had two ships abroad, which they expected back every day, with a quantity of rice, and what else they could get, especially some <b>arrack,</b> which they were to trade for with the Arabian merchants, or take it by force, which should first offer.|$|E
60|$|While we {{continued}} here, several Spaniards {{came on board}} and visited us, and we often went on shore on the same pretence; but our supercargo, who understood his business too well not {{to make use of}} the occasion, presently let the Spaniards see that he had a great cargo of goods to dispose of; they as freely took the hint, and let him know that they had money enough to pay for whatever they bought; so they fell to work, and they bought East India and China silks, Japan ware, China ware, spice, and something of everything we had. We knew we should not sell all our cargo here; nor any extraordinary quantity; but we knew, on the other hand, that, what we did sell here, we should sell for 100l. per cent. extraordinary, I mean more than we should sell for at Lima, or any other ports on that side, and so we did; for here we sold a bottle of <b>arrack</b> for four pieces of eight, a pound of cloves for five pieces of eight, and a pound of nutmegs for six pieces of eight; and the like of other things.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly every {{trace of}} {{civilisation}} fell from my companions {{as if it}} had been a garment. At Aden, shaven and beturbaned, Arab fashion, now they threw off all dress save the loin cloth, and appeared in their dark morocco. Mohammed filled his mouth with a mixture of coarse Surat tobacco and ashes,--the latter article intended, like the Anglo-Indian soldier's chili in his <b>arrack,</b> to [...] "make it bite." [...] Guled uncovered his head, a member which in Africa is certainly made to go bare, and buttered himself with an unguent redolent of sheep's tail; and Ismail, the rais or captain of our [...] "foyst," [...] [6] the Sahalah, applied himself to puffing his nicotiana out of a goat's shank-bone. Our crew, consisting of seventy-one men and boys, prepared, as evening fell, a mess of Jowari grain [7] and grease, the recipe of which I spare you, and it was despatched in a style that would have done credit to Kafirs as regards gobbling, bolting, smearing lips, licking fingers, and using ankles as napkins. Then with a light easterly breeze and the ominous cliffs of Little Aden still in sight, we spread our mats on deck and prepared to sleep under the moon. [8] ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{elephant}} was fastened by the leg to a post, which {{perhaps he}} could have pulled up, had he thought it worth his while, but he was well contented to wave his trunk about and extend its clever finger to receive contributions of cakes and apples, and he was too well amused to resort to any strong measures. The tiger, to Anne's relief, proved {{to be only a}} stuffed specimen. Peregrine, who had seen a good many foreign animals in Holland, where the Dutch captains were in the habit of bringing curiosities home for the delectation of their families in their Lusthausen, was a very amusing companion, having much to tell about bird and beast, while Robert stood staring with open mouth. The long-legged secretary and the beautiful doves were, however, only stuffed, but Anne was much entertained at second hand with the relation of the numerous objects, which on the word of a Leyden merchant had been known to disappear in the former bird's capacious crop, and with stories of the graceful dancing of the cobra, though she was not sorry that the present specimen was only visible in a bottle of <b>arrack,</b> where his spectacled hood was scarcely apparent. Presently a well known shrill young voice was heard. [...] "Yes, yes, I know I shall swoon at that terrible tiger! Oh, don't! I can't come any farther." ...|$|E
60|$|As for the ships, that {{commanded}} by Paul in person {{will be a}} good example of the fleet. She was an old Indiaman, clumsy and crank, smelling strongly of the savor of tea, cloves, and <b>arrack,</b> the cargoes of former voyages. Even at that day she was, from her venerable grotesqueness, what a cocked hat is, at the present age, among ordinary beavers. Her elephantine bulk was houdahed with a castellated poop like the leaning tower of Pisa. Poor Israel, standing on the top of this poop, spy-glass at his eye, looked more an astronomer than a mariner, having to do, not with the mountains of the billows, but the mountains in the moon. Galileo on Fiesole. She was originally a single-decked ship, that is, carried her armament on one gun-deck; but cutting ports below, in her after part, Paul rammed out there six old eighteen-pounders, whose rusty muzzles peered just above the water-line, like a parcel of dirty mulattoes from a cellar-way. Her name was the Duras, but, ere sailing, it was changed to that other appellation, whereby this sad old hulk became afterwards immortal. Though it is not unknown, that a compliment to Doctor Franklin was involved in this change of titles, yet the secret history of the affair will now for the first time be disclosed.|$|E
