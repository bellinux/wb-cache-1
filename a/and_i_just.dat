5|$|The {{first song}} came on <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> {{stood up and}} I kind of walked {{into the other room}} as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo.

5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E
5|$|The Prank War series, which depicts Blumenfeld and Streeter Seidell as {{they play}} a series of {{escalating}} practical jokes on each other, became popular {{and led to the}} two appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in 2009. MTV later hired Seidell and Blumenfeld to host Pranked, a clip show featuring prank videos from the Internet.

5|$|Sia {{is one of}} them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, {{she just}} writes the most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E
25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and he looked at me. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> have some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – but I know he was with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{comments}} he made {{suggesting that}} contracts for the mega-fight {{were close to}} being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, 2010: I think I said it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.|$|E

When asked about {{the first time she}} performed an Amanar in competition, Maroney said, [...] "The first time I did it was at Visa Championships <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> thirteen years old. <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> really little <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't really know what was going on.

500|$|In March 2000, Van Morrison {{told the}} Irish rock {{magazine}} Hot Press {{about the impact}} that Freewheelin made on him: [...] "I think I heard it in a record shop in Smith Street. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> thought it was incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it.

Nevertheless, Mustaine exclaimed the band's new record would be [...] "great" [...] and the songs were [...] "really good".|$|E
500|$|Other publications, such as PopMatters, BlogCritics, and Entertainment Weekly, {{suggested}} that the track referenced Lovato's previous problems with self-harm, specifically in the lines [...] "I try to sever ties and I / Ended up with wounds to bind / Like you're pouring salt in my cuts / <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> ran out of bandaids". Jason Scott of Blogcritics noted that, [...] "If [...] learned one thing this past year, it's how to be brutally and often painfully honest". Chris Willman of Reuters wrote: [...] "The metaphors in the tender, fatalistic 'Fix a Heart' should raise eyebrows, given Lovato's pre-treatment history of cutting".|$|E
