Beyond the descriptive account of the deposits in the area, the book comprises a well-founded critique on academic traditions in archaeology, and their tendency of creating regional and chronological faultlines. These faultlines, it is <b>argued,</b> <b>severely</b> limit our interpretations of deliberate deposition of objects which are, often subsumed under terms like ‘ritual’. In an attempt to overcome these faultlines, Bradley provides an alternative to typological studies of hoard deposits by focusing on object histories and their place within the landscape. Through this approach, original interpretations are presented from hoard deposits (mostly containing metalwork) that transcend pervasive ritual/non-ritual dichotomous interpretations...|$|E

First published in 1996, it chronicles Russian {{history from the}} Famine of 1891-1892, the response to which, Figes <b>argues,</b> <b>severely</b> weakened the Russian Empire, {{to the death of}} Lenin in 1924, when [...] "the basic elements of the Stalinist regime - the one-party state, the system of terror and the cult of the personality - were all in place". According to Figes [...] "... the whole of 1917 could be seen as a political battle between those who saw the revolution as a means of bringing the war to an end and those who saw the war as a means of bringing the revolution to an end." [...] A People's Tragedy won the Wolfson History Prize, the WH Smith Literary Award, the NCR Book Award, the Longman/History Today Book Prize and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. In 2008, the Times Literary Supplement listed A People's Tragedy as one of the [...] "hundred most influential books since the war".|$|R

5000|$|Cumont’s {{theories}} came in {{for severe}} criticism from John R. Hinnells and R.L. Gordon at the First International Congress of Mithraic Studies held in 1971. John Hinnells was unwilling to reject entirely the idea of Iranian origin, but wrote: [...] "we must now conclude that his reconstruction simply will not stand. It receives no support from the Iranian material and is in fact {{in conflict with the}} ideas of that tradition as they are represented in the extant texts. Above all, it is a theoretical reconstruction which does not accord with the actual Roman iconography." [...] He discussed Cumont’s reconstruction of the bull-slaying scene and stated [...] "that the portrayal of Mithras given by Cumont is not merely unsupported by Iranian texts but is actually in serious conflict with known Iranian theology." [...] Another paper by R.L. Gordon <b>argued</b> that Cumont <b>severely</b> distorted the available evidence by forcing the material to conform to his predetermined model of Zoroastrian origins. Gordon suggested that the theory of Persian origins was completely invalid and that the Mithraic mysteries in the West was an entirely new creation.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{strategy}} for controlling “unwanted ” immigration {{that has been}} implemented by the U. S. government since 1993, and suggests explanations {{for the failure of}} that strategy to achieve its stated objectives thus far. Available evidence suggests that a strategy of immigration control that overwhelmingly emphasizes border enforcement and short-changes interior (especially workplace) enforcement has caused illegal entries to be redistributed along the Southwest border; the financial cost of illegal entry has more than quadrupled; undocumented migrants are staying longer in the United States; migrant deaths resulting from clandestine border crossings have risen sharply; {{and there has been a}} surge in anti-immigrant vigilante activity. Consequences predicted by advocates of the concentrated border enforcement strategy have not yet materialized: There is no evidence that unauthorized migration is being deterred at the point of origin; that would-be illegal entrants are being discouraged at the border after multiple apprehensions by the Border Patrol and returning home; that their employment prospects in the U. S. have been curtailed; and that the resident population of undocumented immigrants is shrinking. It is <b>argued</b> that a <b>severely</b> constrained employer sanctions enforcement effort that has left demand for unauthorized immigrant labor intact is the fundamental reason why steadily escalating spending on border enforcement during the last ten years has had such a weak deterrent effect on unauthorized immigration to the United States. Reasons for the persistence of a failed immigration control policy are discussed, and alternatives to the current policy are evaluated...|$|R
40|$|In 2007, {{following}} the Fitzgerald Report, the Irish government launched a 500 million euro {{project for the}} regeneration of areas of severe deprivation in Limerick City. The establishment of these projects, though greeted with great public acclaim, {{was in many ways}} an acknowledgement of the failure of successive public policies to tackle the complex sets of problems which existed in Limerick. Although the regeneration process is now in full swing, there is evidence that the approach being adopted by state agencies is not drawing comprehensively on the body of research which already exists on social deprivation in Limerick. Understanding Limerick: Social Exclusion and Change addresses this gap by gathering together recent expert research on Limerick which draws on a range of theoretical and disciplinary perspectives. By piecing together these expert perspectives, it <b>argues</b> that the <b>severely</b> deprived in Limerick have experienced a range of different forms of social exclusion which have intersected in an almost unique way to create the current crisis in some neighborhoods. Contributors to this text have expertise in a range of research fields including sociology, social policy, planning and urban regeneration, gender and ethnicity studies as well as law and criminal justice perspectives. This edited collection provides not only an overview of available research on Limerick but also attempts to establish how lessons learned from evaluating social exclusion in Limerick might contribute to broader national and international policy debates...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the recent suggestions by Barausse et al. (astro-ph/ 0501152) and Kolb et al. (hep-th/ 0503117) that {{the acceleration of}} the universe {{could be explained by}} large superhorizon fluctuations generated by inflation. We show that no acceleration can be produced by this mechanism. We begin by showing how the application of Raychaudhuri equation to inhomogeneous cosmologies results in several ``no go'' theorems for accelerated expansion. Next we derive an exact solution for a specific case of initial perturbations, for which application of the Kolb et al. expressions leads to an acceleration, while the exact solution reveals that no acceleration is present. We show that the discrepancy can be traced to higher order terms that were dropped in the Kolb et al. analysis. We proceed with the analysis of initial value formulation of general relativity to <b>argue</b> that causality <b>severely</b> limits what observable effects can be derived from superhorizon perturbations. By constructing a Riemann normal coordinate system on initial slice we show that no infrared divergence terms arise in this coordinate system. Thus any divergences found previously can be eliminated by a local rescaling of coordinates and are unobservable. We perform an explicit analysis of the variance of the deceleration parameter for the case of single field inflation using usual coordinates and show that the infrared divergent terms found by Barausse et al. and Kolb et al. cancel against several additional terms not considered in their analysis. Finally, we argue that introducing isocurvature perturbations does not alter our conclusion that the accelerating expansion of the universe cannot be explained by superhorizon modes.

40|$|Inclusion" in {{the broad}} sense of access to, and {{participation}} in, public policy and services has been lacking {{in the majority of}} developing countries [...] -whether authoritarian or democratic [...] -due to highly skewed political, social and economic power structures. To understand why this tends to be the case, the dissertation provides a political economy model for understanding civil society, arguing that the evolution of civil society and its potential as a vehicle for inclusion are conditioned by the economic imperatives in place and the state prerogatives. More specifically, I question {{the extent to which the}} neoliberal model allows civil society to fulfill this role, by examining the impact of Social Funds (SFs), a key social policy institution created and promoted solely under the neoliberal model, on civil society in Egypt and Bolivia. I <b>argue</b> that neoliberalism <b>severely</b> limits the possibility of: citizenship construction, achieving development synergy between the state and civil society, or strengthening the latter. These limitations are structural, inherent to the neoliberal development model and the changes it has brought about economically and politically. The research shows how these changes have manifestations within the state, the economy and civil society and more specifically social policy. Just as important, there are limitations intrinsically grounded in the structures found in many developing countries, pre-neoliberal changes. Such structures, I argue, do not allow new institutions like SFs to push forward such an ideal three-way relationship among the economy, state and civil society. Rather than strengthening civil society and creating development synergy, SFs are shown to be just an attempt to give neoliberal policies a human face and subdue any potential for structural changes. More generally, by contrasting the dynamics of civil society under neoliberalism in a developing country with a democratic regime (Bolivia) with those of a soft authoritarian regime (Egypt). I argue that a dichotomous framework, which sees democracy as antithetically opposed to authoritarianism is not necessarily appropriate to the analysis of developing countries. The cases illustrate that the state and civil society, under two-different regime types, continue to share a number of similarities...|$|R
6000|$|We {{have nothing}} {{remaining}} of those Varronian satires excepting some inconsiderable fragments, and {{those for the}} most part much corrupted. The tithes of many of them are indeed preserved, and they are generally double; from whence, at least, we may understand how many various subjects were treated by that author. Tully in his [...] "Academics" [...] introduces Varro himself giving us some light concerning the scope and design of those works; wherein, after he had shown his reasons why he did not ex professo write of philosophy, he adds what follows:- [...] "Notwithstanding," [...] says he, [...] "that those pieces of mine wherein I have imitated Menippus, though I have not translated him, are sprinkled with a kind of mirth and gaiety, yet many things are there inserted which are drawn from the very entrails of philosophy, and many things <b>severely</b> <b>argued</b> which I have mingled with pleasantries on purpose that they may more easily go down with the common sort of unlearned readers." [...] The rest of the sentence is so lame that we can only make thus much out of it--that in the composition of his satires he so tempered philology with philosophy that his work was a mixture of them both. And Tully himself confirms us in this opinion when a little after he addresses himself to Varro in these words:- [...] "And you yourself have composed a most elegant and complete poem; you have begun philosophy in many places; sufficient to incite us, though too little to instruct us." [...] Thus it appears that Varro was one of those writers whom they called [Greek text which cannot be reproduced] (studious of laughter); and that, as learned as he was, his business was more to divert his reader than to teach him. And he entitled his own satires Menippean; not that Menippus had written any satires (for his were either dialogues or epistles), but that Varro imitated his style, his manner, and his facetiousness. All that we know further of Menippus and his writings, which are wholly lost, is that by some he is esteemed, as, amongst the rest, by Varro; by others he is noted of cynical impudence and obscenity; that he was much given to those parodies which I have already mentioned (that is, he often quoted the verses of Homer and the tragic poets, and turned their serious meaning into something that was ridiculous); whereas Varro's satires are by Tully called absolute, and most elegant and various poems. Lucian, who was emulous of this Menippus, seems to have imitated both his manners and his style in many of his dialogues, where Menippus himself is often introduced as a speaker in them and as a perpetual buffoon; particularly his character is expressed in the beginning of that dialogue which is called [Greek text which cannot be reproduced]. But Varro in imitating him avoids his impudence and filthiness, and only expresses his witty pleasantry.|$|R
