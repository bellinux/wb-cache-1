Kenseth took {{the lead on}} lap 61, as Earnhardt and others made green-flag pit stops. Kenseth stopped on lap 71 with Biffle and Edwards, with Biffle taking the lead as the pit-stop cycle ended. Lap 72 saw the first caution, as Blaney's left rear tire shredded <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> pit stop. Biffle, Edwards and Sterling Marlin stayed out, while the others stopped.|$|E
5|$|Bradford {{had just}} 13 players when McCall took over, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> number of summer signings {{including}} defender Darren Williams, midfielders Kyle Nix, Alex Rhodes and Scott Phelan, and strikers Barry Conlon, Guylain Ndumbu-Nsungu and Peter Thorne. McCall recorded his first win {{as a manager}} against Wrexham on 25 August 2007 after substitute Luke Medley scored a late winner, but despite his pre-season target his team {{spent much of the}} first half of the season in the bottom half of the table. After going unbeaten in January, the club were still 15th in League Two, and McCall told the Telegraph & Argus he did not regret his pre-season target but was carried away with the euphoria at the time. City's form continued to improve during the second half of the season, and McCall led his side to 10th place in League Two.|$|E
5|$|In the Second Test at Melbourne, Davidson made 40 in Australia's first {{innings of}} 316. and then {{captured}} 6/75 to restrict England's lead to 15. Australia then 248 with Davidson contributing 17, {{but he went}} wicketless in the second innings as England successfully reached their target with seven wickets in hand to take a 1–0 series lead. Australia's victory in the Third Test at Sydney, was Davidson's first Test victory on his home ground, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> major contribution with bowling figures of 4/54 and 5/25; the latter effort included the wickets of Pullar, Sheppard and Dexter to precipitate a collapse that saw England all out for 104. This left Australia with a victory target of only 65, which was reached just {{before the beginning of}} a heavy thunderstorm that would have caused the remainder of the match to be abandoned, thus saving England from defeat.|$|E

5|$|While {{coming across}} the Piquet and Rossiter battle Lotterer moved in front of {{teammate}} Jarvis to claim second place. Rusinov entered the pit lane from the LMP2 lead for left-rear bodywork repairs and Rast was handed the No. 26 Oreca. Piquet was able to pass Rossiter for eighth position overall while Turner moved ahead of the other Ford car to run in third in LMGTE Pro. The second round of pit stops began one minute later when Jarvis entered the pit lane and {{the remainder of the}} LMP1 field followed in response for driver changes. Benoît Tréluyer pushed hard and lost control of his car's back-end at Vale corner, allowing Jani to move into second position. Christensen's right-front tyre was punctured at Becketts corner <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> pit stop for a replacement wheel which promoted Turner to second in the class. After changing drivers in the No. 42 Strakka Racing Gibson, Danny Watts overtook González at Brooklands corner for second position in LMP2. Hartley went to the outside of Wainwright driving through Farm Curve and his car's right-front quarter made contact with Wainwright's left-rear section. Hartley went over the bonnet of the No. 86 Porsche but avoided flipping over; both cars went off the track, skidding across the gravel trap, and into the barriers {{at the end of the}} Complex. Both Hartley and Wainwright retired from the event and a full course yellow flag was necessitated to allow the cars to be extracted from the track.|$|E
25|$|His {{experience}} with council housing issues was a considerable asset in winning selection, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> {{speech to the}} Labour Party conference in 1978 arguing that public authorities needed a surplus of council housing in order to solve the housing crisis.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Second World War, Blunt played 14 {{first-class}} {{games for}} Worcestershire between 1946 and 1948, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> good start to his county cricket career by taking seven wickets (including his career best of 5-60) against Hampshire at Southampton on debut.|$|E

25|$|Noel King {{signed him}} then for Shamrock Rovers in September 1988 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> scoring debut against his first club on 30 September in a 3–1 derby win. He also scored {{in his last}} game for the club at Cork City on 21 April 1989. Despite being sent off in Derry on Halloween he was top scorer in that 1988–89 season.|$|E
25|$|Huygens {{designed}} {{more accurate}} clocks than were {{available at the}} time. His invention of the pendulum clock was a breakthrough in timekeeping, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> prototype {{by the end of}} 1656. In 1657 he contracted the construction of his designs to Salomon Coster in The Hague, with a local patent (octroy). He was less successful elsewhere: Pierre Séguier refused him any French rights, Simon Douw of Rotterdam copied the design in 1658, and Ahasuerus Fromanteel also, in London. The oldest known Huygens-style pendulum clock is dated 1657 and can be seen at the Museum Boerhaave in Leiden.|$|E
25|$|Northcote {{was still}} Governor of Bombay when the Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, offered him {{the post of}} Governor-General of Australia in 1903. The first two Governors-General, Lord Hopetoun and Lord Tennyson, had served {{shortened}} terms and had had difficult relations with Australian ministers. Both the British and Australian governments wanted stability and continuity, and Northcote was appointed for a five-year term. His lifelong experience in politics and his time in Bombay made him a suitable appointment. He was neither as imperious as Hopetoun nor as stuffy as Tennyson, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> good impression with both politicians and the public.|$|E

25|$|Bingley then {{signed for}} the Marconi Stallions, {{and in his}} first season with the club, made 24 {{appearances}} for two goals as they finished second in the premiership before taking the title with a 1–0 win over West Adelaide in the Grand Final. Several more international appearances at the senior level preceded Bingley becoming a regular with the Stallions, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> total of 117 league appearances for the club through to the 1996–97 season, scoring 19 goals. During his time there, Marconi missed the finals series just once, and in 1995–96 finished on top of the ladder before falling to the Melbourne Knights in the Grand Final.|$|E
25|$|After his England call up, Cook's {{appearances}} at Essex significantly reduced. In the County Championship {{he appeared in}} only three matches, making two hundreds and another two fifties in his five innings, topping the season averages with an inflated 141.3. Similarly in the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy he appeared only three times and again topped the batting averages, only being out once with a top score of 91 and average of 148. He scored less favourably in his one Twenty20 Cup appearance, scoring only nine runs. In the 2007 season, for Essex alone his first-class average was only 58.8 from three appearances, making two hundreds but countering this with one duck <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> similar century/duck appearance in the (formerly C) Friends Provident Trophy during his 5 matches averaging 38.4.|$|E
25|$|Although his {{relationship}} with the pope was rocky, Guiscard preferred to be on good terms with the papacy, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> gesture of abandoning his first wife in response to church law. While the popes were often fearful of his growing power, they preferred the strong and independent hand of a Catholic Norman to the rule of a Byzantine Greek. Guiscard received his investment with Sicily at the hands of Pope Nicholas II, who feared the opposition of the Holy Roman Emperor to the Papal reforms more. Guiscard supported the reforms, coming to the rescue of a besieged Pope Gregory VII, who had once excommunicated him for encroaching on the territory of the Papal States. After the Great Schism of 1054, the polarized religious atmosphere served to strengthen Guiscard's alliance with papal forces, resulting in a formidable papal-Norman opposition to the Eastern Empire.|$|E

25|$|Mark Taylor retired {{at the end}} of the 1998–99 {{season and}} Waugh {{replaced}} him as Test captain, beginning with a tour of the Caribbean. Australia was expected to win as the West Indies had just been whitewashed 5–0 by South Africa. After easily winning the First Test, Australia was stymied by West Indies skipper Brian Lara, who batted with Jimmy Adams for the entire second day of the Second Test. This led to a victory for the home side, and in the Third Test, Lara batted for the entire final day to secure an unlikely win by one wicket. This result placed Waugh under immense pressure <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> controversial decision to drop Shane Warne from the team for the final Fourth Test. Australia won the final Test despite a third consecutive century from Lara, and retained the Frank Worrell Trophy 2–2.|$|E
25|$|Charlesworth {{made his}} List A debut in October 1989 in a Nissan Shield match for Griqualand West against Western Transvaal at the Fanie du Toit Sports Complex. Charlesworth bowled 9 overs for 32 runs, and scored 36* in the match. A month later, {{he made his}} {{first-class}} debut in a 1989/90 Castle Bowl match against Orange Free State B at Harmony Gold Mine Cricket Club A Ground. He took 1/91 in the first innings, and scored 19 and 43. At the same time, Charlesworth represented Impalas, a team that represented South African minor provinces, in the Benson & Hedges Series of 1989/90 and 1990/91. His highest first-class score was 81 for Griqualand West against Boland in a 1990/91 Castle Bowl match, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> single List A century in his career, in a 1990/91 Benson & Hedges Series match for Impalas against Eastern Province. In 1993, Charlesworth made first-class appearances for Cambridge University, and a single List A appearance for the Combined Universities in the 1993 Benson & Hedges Cup.|$|E
25|$|In the team's second match, Khan {{led them}} to their first Test win on English soil for 28 years at Lord's. Khan's first year as captain was {{the peak of his}} legacy as a fast bowler as well as an all-rounder. He {{recorded}} the best Test bowling of his career while taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka at Lahore in 1981–1982. He also topped both the bowling and batting averages against England in three Test series in 1982, taking 21 wickets and averaging 56 with the bat. Later the same year, he put up a highly acknowledged performance in a home series against the formidable Indian team by taking 40 wickets in six Tests at an average of 13.95. By the end of this series in 1982–1983, Khan had taken 88 wickets in 13 Test matches over a period of one year as captain. This same Test series against India, however, also resulted in a stress fracture in his shin that kept him out of cricket for more than two years. An experimental treatment funded by the Pakistani government helped him recover by the end of 1984 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> successful comeback to international cricket {{in the latter part of}} the 1984–1985 season.|$|E

25|$|Alongside Barkley, {{his former}} Olympic teammate, {{he was also}} teamed with Hakeem Olajuwon, but there were {{chemistry}} problems, especially with Barkley. Pippen had his first triple-double in a 93–87 loss against the Atlanta Hawks as he had 15 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists in addition to 1 steal in 46 minutes of play. On April 22, 1999, Pippen was detained under suspicion of driving while intoxicated. A Houston police officer who stopped Pippen about 1:30a.m. said the Rockets' star ran a red light. A member of the department's DWI task force was called after it was suspected Pippen was intoxicated, Houston police spokesman Fred King said. The charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence. He had his second triple-double {{of the season in}} a 106–101 loss against the Los Angeles Clippers as he had 23 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds in addition to 6 steals in 45 minutes of play. Despite averaging a career high in minutes per game with 40.2 and finishing 4th in the NBA in minutes played, Pippen averaged 14.5 points per game, his lowest since his rookie year, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> career-low 43.2 percent of his shots. He also averaged 6.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists and was named to the NBA All-Defensive first team for the 8th time. The Rockets finished the season with a 31–19 record, finishing third in the Midwest Division and fifth in the Western Conference. They faced the Los Angeles Lakers {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. In Game 3 of the series, Pippen scored 37 points, 13 rebounds, 4 assists and 1 block in order to stave off elimination. The Lakers would go on to win the series the following game as they defeated the Rockets 98–88 and took the series 3–1.|$|E

500|$|After {{the failure}} of the all-conservative government, the Grand Duchess turned to the leading liberal politician, Victor Thorn, to form a new government. [...] After Eyschen's premiership of 27 years, two governments had come and gone in three months, and the Luxembourgish people were {{becoming}} disillusioned with {{the failure of}} the politicians. [...] Thorn's nature was to be a conciliatory leader, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> direct appeal to the Chamber of Deputies to support his government, no matter the deputies' individual ideological persuasions: [...] "If you want a government that acts, and is capable of acting, it is imperative that all parties support this government." [...] This support was forthcoming from all parties, but only on the condition that each was invited into the government; Thorn was left with no choice but to afford them this. [...] The resulting grand coalition cabinet included every leading light in Luxembourgish politics; besides Thorn himself, there were the conservatives Léon Kauffmann and Antoine Lefort, the socialist leader Dr Michel Welter, and the liberal Léon Moutrier.|$|E
