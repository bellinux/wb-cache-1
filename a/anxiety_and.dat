40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the <b>anxieties,</b> the self-acceptances <b>and</b> the ego-identities in Japanese and Chinese college students, and to clarify the relationships among their <b>anxieties,</b> self-acceptances <b>and</b> ego-identities. The subjects were 928 Japanese college students and 866 Chinese college students. The following results were obtained: (1) Japanese college students had higher anxieties than Chinese college students. (2) The positive anxieties were higher than the negative anxieties in both Japanese and Chinese students. (3) Chinese students had higher self-acceptances than Japanese students. (4) The self-acceptances had positive correlations with the positive <b>anxieties</b> <b>and</b> negative correlations with the negative <b>anxieties,</b> <b>and</b> the self-denials had positive correlations with the negative anxieties in both Japanese and Chinese students. (5) About the ego-identity, there were more Japanese students in identity achievement, moratorium, or identity diffusion status than Chinese students. However, there were more Chinese students in identity achievement-foreclosure intermediate or foreclosure status than Japanese students. (6) Both Japanese and Chinese students in identity diffusion status had the highest negative <b>anxieties</b> <b>and</b> the lowest positive <b>anxieties.</b> <b>And,</b> the both students in identity achievement status had the highest positive anxieties...|$|R

Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. <b>Anxiety</b> <b>and</b> drug and alcohol abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties.

5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} {{the investigation and}} confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases utilized camera angles seen in horror films, which allowed enemies to lurk {{in areas that are}} concealed from the player's view. Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|Alprazolam is {{effective}} in the relief of moderate to severe <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> panic attacks. However, {{it is not a}} first line treatment since the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows that the benefits of alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only 4 to 10 weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit.|$|E

It can help with adjustment to a new relationship dynamic and self-image (such as being placed {{in the role of}} caretaker) or with stresses that arise in the sexual relationship. Frequently, partners of injured people must contend with feelings like guilt, anger, <b>anxiety,</b> <b>and</b> exhaustion while dealing with the added financial burden of lost wages and medical expenses. Counseling aims to strengthen the relationship by improving communication and trust.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> agitation.|$|E

A study of the long-term psychological effects of the bombings on the survivors found that even 17–20 years after the bombings had occurred survivors showed a higher prevalence of <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> somatization symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) {{recommends}} benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam {{only as a}} second-line choice, if {{the treatment}} with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful.

CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating ruminative worry, the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.|$|E
