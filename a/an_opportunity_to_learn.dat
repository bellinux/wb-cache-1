Similar experiments have not been uncommon, the most well-known of which is the Shavian alphabet.|$|E

500|$|Many {{commentators}} saw {{the film}} as a message {{of support for the}} struggles of native peoples today. Evo Morales, the first indigenous president of Bolivia, praised Avatar for its [...] "profound show of resistance to capitalism and the struggle for the defense of nature". Others compared the human invaders with [...] "NATO in Iraq or Israel in Palestine", and considered it reassuring that [...] "when the Na'vi clans are united, and a sincere prayer is offered, the... 'primitive savages' win the war." [...] Palestinian activists painted themselves blue and dressed like the Na'vi during their weekly protest in the village of Bilin against Israel's separation barrier. [...] Other Arab writers, however, noted that [...] "for Palestinians, Avatar is rather a reaffirmation and confirmation of the claims about their incapability to lead themselves and build their own future." [...] Forbes columnist Reihan Salam criticized the vilification of capitalism in the film, asserting that it represents a more noble and heroic way of life than that led by the Na'vi, because it [...] "give everyone <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn,</b> discover, and explore, and to change the world around us." [...] Si Sheppard on the other hand praised the film for drawing parallels between the corporate imperialism of the fictional RDA and its historical equivalents of the pre-industrial era (specifically the East India Company, which maintained its own private army in order to impose profit-driven territorial sovereignty at the expense of indigenous peoples).|$|E

2500|$|In September 1917, he was {{appointed}} counsel to a commission, the President's Mediation Committee, established by President Wilson to resolve major strikes threatening war production. Among the disturbances he investigated were the 1916 Preparedness Day Bombing in San Francisco, where he argued strongly that the radical leader Thomas Mooney had been framed and required a new trial. He also examined the copper industry in Arizona, where industry bosses solved industrial relations problems by having more than 1,000 strikers forcibly deported to New Mexico. Overall, Frankfurter's work gave him <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> firsthand about labor politics and extremism, including anarchism, communism and revolutionary socialism. He came to sympathize with labor issues, arguing that [...] "unsatisfactory, remediable social conditions, if unattended, give rise to radical movements far transcending the original impulse."

2500|$|By 665 CE., the Tibetan {{army had}} conquered {{the city of}} Khotan. Ironically, while the Tibetans {{occupied}} the Khotanese kingdom, it was the Khotanese who influenced the Tibetans. [...] This was most notable {{in the cases of}} the technical vocabulary and the translation techniques used for Buddhist texts. [...] Much like the modern-day Tibetan alphabet, the Khotanese alphabet utilized a Cursive Gupta script, most likely influenced by Sanskrit from its nearby neighbors. [...] While writing down a translation of a Sanskrit work, Khotanese scribes would render Buddhist technical vocabulary though an etymology of each syllable. [...] This helped the Khotanese maintain the accuracy of their translations, even if they were more concise than the Sanskrit and Pali originals. [...] The Tibetans had long sought to translate Buddhist Sanskrit texts in a more efficient matter, because at that time they did not share a common alphabet. [...] The occupation of the Central Asian kingdom however gave Tibetans <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the Khotanese alphabet. [...] By the 9th Century, the Tibetans had adapted the Khotanese alphabet for their language.|$|E
