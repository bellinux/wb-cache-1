This SOI wafer and the un-patterned III-V wafer are then exposed to an oxygen plasma before being pressed together at a low (for semiconductor manufacturing) temperature of 300C for 12hours. This process fuses the two wafers together. The III-V wafer is then etched into mesas to expose electrical layers in the epitaxial structure.

50|$|While the {{commercial}} success of flat-panel display opens {{an era of}} large area electronics, other emerging applications, such as rollable display, printable thin film solar cell and electronic skin, demonstrate further desirable attributes for macroelectronic systems, including flexibility, portability and low-cost. To realize these attributes, a growing trend is to fabricate macroelectronic products directly on flexible substrates, such as polymers. The flat-panel displays currently available in market <b>are</b> <b>fabricated</b> <b>on</b> glass substrates and are fragile. A case in recent news is the cracking of the screens of the iPod nano, a music player that Apple Computer expects to be its best-selling portable device. By contrast, displays made on thin polymer substrates are rugged. Flexible displays of large areas will be lightweight and can be rolled up - they will be portable. For example, in Sept. 2005, Philips Polymer Vision has revealed the world's first prototype of a rollable electronic reader, which can unfold to a 5-inch display and roll back into a pocket-size (100×60×20 mm) device. Furthermore, such thin-film devices on flexible polymer substrates can lend themselves to low-cost fabrication process (i.e., roll-to-roll printing), resulting in lightweight, rugged and flexible macroelectronic products.|$|E

50|$|The {{push for}} reduced cost, more compact circuit boards, and added {{customer}} features has providedincentives {{for the inclusion}} of analog functions on primarily digital MOS integrated circuits (ICs) formingmixed-signal ICs. In these systems, the speed of digital circuits is constantly increasing, chips arebecoming more densely packed, interconnect layers are added, and analog resolution is increased. In addition, recent increase in wireless applications and its growing market are introducing a new set of aggressive design goals for realizing mixed-signal systems. Here, the designer integrates radio frequency(RF) analog and base band digital circuitry on a single chip. The goal is to make single-chip radio frequencyintegrated circuits (RFICs) on silicon, where all the blocks <b>are</b> <b>fabricated</b> <b>on</b> the same chip. One of the advantages of this integration is low power dissipation for portability due to a {{reduction in the number of}} package pins and associated bond wire capacitance. Another reason that an integrated solution offers lower power consumption is that routing high-frequency signals off-chip often requires a 50Ω impedance match, which can result in higher power dissipation. Other advantages include improved high-frequency performance due to reduced package interconnect parasitics, higher system reliability, smaller package count, and higher integration of RF components with VLSI-compatible digital circuits. In fact, the single-chip transceiver is now a reality.|$|E
