Curso de Pós-Graduação em Ciências GeodésicasResumo: Neste trabalho, procuramos introduzir a utilização do geopotencial na obtenção de altitudes científicas de uma rede de nivelamento geométrico de precisão, situada na região metropolitana de Curitiba, onde as altitudes das Referências de Nível (RNs) foram obtidas pelo ajustamento dos desníveis brutos e pela correção do não-paralelismo das superfícies equipotenciais. Calculamos os números geopotenciais daquelas RNs e, a partir deles, as altitudes de Helmert, Vignal e Baranov, bem como <b>a</b> <b>altitude</b> dinâmica. Apresentamos ainda <b>a</b> <b>altitude</b> normal, segundo M. S. Molodensky e <b>a</b> <b>altitude</b> ortométrica "free-air", sugerida por Petr Vanícêk. Abstract: The {{geopotential}} {{numbers were}} used to determine differences in elevation of sucessive points on the Earth's surface in Curitiba City. Originaly, the height of the Bench Marks (B. M.) were obtained by adjusting the levelled heights and the correction of the convergence of equipotential surfaces. The geopotential numbers of B. M. - were found from the levelled height and the observed gravity values near benchmarks, and from them the Helmert's, Vignal's, Baranov's and the Dynamic Heignt were obtained. It's also presented in this work the Normal Height and Orthometric Height Free-air suggested by M. S. Molodensky and Petr Vanicek respectively...|$|R

Plains lie to the city's south and east, where any sources of water would be at too low <b>an</b> <b>altitude</b> to be able to flow to the city, while the hills to the west made a water supply route too difficult from an engineering point of view. The only real alternative was to look to the north and in particular to the area around Ucetia (Uzès), where there are natural springs.|$|E

50|$|In each {{range of}} altitudes there are altitude-specific {{concerns}} being addressed by researchers and developers. <b>As</b> <b>altitude</b> increases, tethers increase in length, {{the temperature of}} the air changes, and vulnerability to atmospheric lightning changes. With increasing altitude, exposure to liabilities increase, costs increase, turbulence exposure changes, likelihood of having the system fly in more than one directional strata of winds increases, and the costs of operation changes. HAWP systems that are flown must climb through all intermediate altitudes up to final working altitudes—being at first a low- and then <b>a</b> high- <b>altitude</b> device.|$|R
