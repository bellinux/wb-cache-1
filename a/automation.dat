40|$|Abstract—For decades now, {{mainstream}} development environments {{provide the}} same basic <b>automations</b> for navigating source code: mainly searching and the tree exploration of files and folders. This may imply that other <b>automations</b> have little additional value or too steep a learning curve for mainstream adoption. This paper investigates whether existing navigation <b>automations</b> enriched with traceability benefit basic maintenance tasks such as changing features and fixing bugs in code. To test this, we conducted a controlled experiment with 52 subjects performing real maintenance tasks on two third-party development projects: all with the same navigation tool but half of the tasks with {{and the other half}} without traceability navigation. We found that the existence of traceability profoundly affected the quality of the change tasks and fundamentally changed how software engineers navigated through source code. We show that software engineers benefit instantly from traceability, without training, which is to show that the current <b>automations</b> available to software engineers are by no means sufficient or the only easy ones to use.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a new real time control method in actuators continuous flux and their implementation using complex <b>automations,</b> aimed at determining the behaviour, functional parameters and performances. The mathematical model is presented for the real-time control problem of continuous flow actuators {{and there are}} indicated two probabilistic modalities which have been approached: a probabilistic evaluation and a linear prediction based procedure. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretically predicted results for mathematical modelling of the correlation between actuators. Finally, we obtain real-time control of actuators without the entry signals to be generated by the trial actuator by means of direct measurement. Theoretic and experimental results {{have shown that the}} behaviour errors of the actuators that have been tested through the proposed method are less than 1 % while the testing duration is over 30 times less.
