5|$|<b>A</b> <b>happier</b> family event from Cosima's {{standpoint}} was Siegfried's {{marriage in}} 1915, {{at the age}} of 46, to Winifred Williams, the 18-year-old foster-daughter of Karl Klindworth who had been friends with both Wagner and Liszt. When the couple's first son, Wieland, was born on 5 January 1917, Cosima celebrated by playing excerpts from the Siegfried Idyll on Wagner's piano.|$|E
5|$|The band {{rented a}} house, {{and hoped that}} living communally would foster good {{relations}} and <b>a</b> <b>happier</b> recording environment. According to Corgan, Iha refused {{to live in the}} house and rarely visited. The recording sessions continued to be slow-moving and heavily technical. In the absence of a drummer, the band used a drum machine as it had in its earliest incarnation. The band also enlisted Joey Waronker, of Beck's band, and Matt Cameron, of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, for a few songs each. Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb contributed electronic sequencing and sounds to eight album tracks, with the band giving him mostly free rein.|$|E
5|$|After {{four years}} in retirement, he {{received}} an unexpected invitation to become Master of Peterhouse in 1987, thus becoming {{the first person in}} over four centuries to lead a college at both Oxford and Cambridge. Chadwick's second appointment as head of a college proved <b>a</b> <b>happier</b> experience than his first. The college had been experiencing some problems following the admission of the first female students, to which some fellows were implacably opposed, making their displeasure known at High Table. Chadwick insisted on civility, which coupled with the retirement of some of the fellows, ensured an improvement in the atmosphere within the college. This continued after his second retirement (again to Oxford) in 1993. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours. In 1991 he published a new translation of Augustine's Confessions, with extensive notes revealing Augustine's debt to Plotinus.|$|E

25|$|Newport had {{a mediocre}} 1987 season in England, his {{first-class}} batting average of over 41 that year being artificially inflated by twelve not-outs in twenty five innings. He had <b>a</b> <b>happier</b> time in one-day cricket, taking 34 wickets at 16.70, including his career-best one-day analysis of 5–22. That winter {{he went to}} play for Boland in South African domestic cricket, and was reasonably successful, averaging 25 with the bat and 19 with the ball.|$|E
25|$|Living at {{the edge}} of town, however, led to Eiseley's early {{interest}} in the natural world, to which he turned when being at home was too difficult. There, he would play in the caves and creek banks nearby. Fortunately, there were others who opened the door to <b>a</b> <b>happier</b> life. His half-brother, Leo, for instance, gave him a copy of Robinson Crusoe, with which he taught himself to read. Thereafter, he managed to find ways to get to the public library and became a voracious reader.|$|E
25|$|Eddie Hunter {{was fired}} in December 1994 as Queen's failed to {{recapture}} {{the achievements of the}} previous decade. Former Alloa Athletic manager Hugh McCann was appointed as his successor but after an 8th-place finish in the new 10 team Third Division, he left the club. Graeme Elder took over as player/coach but the team continued their disappointing run and he eventually resigned. <b>A</b> <b>happier</b> memory from this time was the 5–1 demolition of Albion Rovers at Hampden in August 1997, the opposition finishing the match with seven players. There was also an incredible 5–5 draw at East Fife in Hunter's last season, with fan favourite Brian McPhee scoring four goals for Queen's.|$|E

25|$|Renewable {{energies}} {{and renewable energy}} technologies have many advantages over their fossil fuel counterparts. These advantages include the absence of local pollution such as particulates, sulphur oxides (SOX's) and nitrous oxides (NOX's). For the business community, the economic advantages are also becoming clearer. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} the working environment has a significant effect on workforce morale. Renewable energy solutions are a part of this, wind turbines in particular being seen by many as a potent symbol of a new modernity, where environmental considerations are taken seriously. A workforce seeing a forward-looking and responsible company is more likely to feel good about working for such a company. <b>A</b> <b>happier</b> workforce is a more productive workforce.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the musical}} {{includes}} many scenes and jokes {{taken from the}} film, there are many differences. The film was set in the present day of its year of release, 1968. The musical is set in 1959; consequently the character Lorenzo St. Dubois (LSD), a hippie who played Hitler, was omitted from the 2001 musical. In the original film, Max and Leo seek to procure $1,000,000; in the musical it has become $2,000,000. Ulla has a much larger role in the musical and {{is more than just}} the vapid actress of the movie. Franz Liebkind is portrayed more sympathetically and comes to <b>a</b> <b>happier</b> ending than his 1968 counterpart. Overall, the musical is more upbeat than the original film, which was a darker comedy.|$|E

Out of our four records, I thought this might be the one where you're driving down the road listening to it on a sunny summer day." [...] Rawlings again produced the record. The album also reflected a change in the typically sparse instrumentation: Welch and Rawlings introduced a dobro, violin, electric bass and drums, and Welch later said, [...] "Everything's not supposed to sound the same, you want it to reflect change and growth." ...|$|E
500|$|Rebranding in 2013 {{as part of}} the [...] "making pizza happy" [...] {{campaign}} involved {{introducing a}} new logo along with new pizza boxes and uniforms.

The company introduced a [...] "happy bell" [...] to ring when customers were having a good time—aiming for <b>a</b> <b>happier</b> feeling for the in-store experience. The campaign was rolled out in stages, beginning in Far North Queensland, a decision an Eagle Boys spokesperson said was designed to pay homage to the chain's regional heritage.|$|E

500|$|After Secret Mountain Fort Awesome got axed, the Cartoonstitute {{original}} Uncle Grandpa short that Browngardt produced {{was adapted}} {{as a full}} series of the same name. A its preview was shown as part of Cartoon Network's shorts development initiative. The series revolves around the title character, who is simultaneously the grandfather and uncle of everyone in the world. Browngardt explained that while the new series would retain some aspects of Secret Mountain, {{it would be a}} more lighthearted adaption for children. He ultimately expressed that he wanted [...] "more variety in the music and be able to go [...] sort of <b>a</b> <b>happier</b> place, though it does go dark and heavy at times".|$|E
500|$|Like the Classicists, Heliade {{favored a}} {{literature}} highlighting [...] "types" [...] of characters, as {{the union of}} universal traits and particular characteristics, but, like the Romantics, he encouraged writers to write from a subjective viewpoint, which he believed to be indicative of their mission as [...] "prophets,... men who criticize, who point out their society's plagues and who look on to <b>a</b> <b>happier</b> future, waiting for a savior". Through the latter ideal of moral regeneration, Heliade also complimented the Romantic stress on [...] "national specificity", which he adopted in his later years. At the same time, he centered much of his own literary work on non-original material, either by compiling it from various translations or by translating from a single source—having his focus on creating the basis for further development by introducing samples of untapped literary genres and styles to Romanian literature.|$|E
