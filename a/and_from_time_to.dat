5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} dragline of silk as it moves, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> time anchors the dragline to a surface with a spot of sticky silk. This allows the spider {{to return to the}} surface if the animal is dislodged. A spider about to jump first lays a sticky silk anchor, and then lays out a dragline as it flies. Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves.|$|E
5|$|MacMillan {{was born}} in Dunfermline, Scotland, the {{youngest}} of four surviving children of William MacMillan (1891–1946), who was a labourer <b>and,</b> <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> time, cook, and his wife, Edith (1888–1942) née Shreeve. His father {{had served in the}} army in the First World War, and suffered permanent physical and mental damage. In search of work he moved with his family to his wife's home town, Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. After attending a local primary school, Kenneth studied from 1940 at Great Yarmouth Grammar School, to which he won a scholarship. As Great Yarmouth was a target for German air raids in the Second World War, the school was evacuated to Retford in Nottinghamshire.|$|E

Audrey Withers, the editor of Vogue, wanted David to write more personal columns than she had done for Harper's, and paid her £20 a month for food ingredients <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> time £100 for research trips to France.|$|E

5|$|I am {{of opinion}} {{that by the}} terms and spirit of the statute under which this {{proceeding}} has been had, no other than the district attorney of the county of Genesee (in which the lands intruded upon are situated) could regularly be a relator.

Without the act, John Blacksmith or any other person could not claim such summary proceedings to remove intruders upon Indian lands; and with the act, no other person is authorized by its provisions to make complaint of such intrusions, or to cause the intruders to be removed, but the district attorney of the county in which the lands are situated.|$|E

Of Liszt's German concerts between 1840 and 1845, the five most frequently played pieces were the Grand galop chromatique, Schubert's Erlkönig (in Liszt's transcription), Réminiscences de Don Juan, Réminiscences de Robert le Diable, and Réminiscences de Lucia di Lammermoor. Among the works by other composers were Weber's Invitation to the Dance, Chopin mazurkas, études by composers like Ignaz Moscheles, Chopin and Ferdinand Hiller, but also major works by Beethoven, Schumann, Weber and Hummel, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> time even selections from Bach, Handel and Scarlatti.|$|E

25|$|The grand tribal {{identities of}} Berber antiquity {{were said to}} be the Mauri, the Numidians, and the Gaetulians. The Mauri {{inhabited}} the far west (ancient Mauritania, now Morocco and central Algeria). The Numidians were located between the Mauri and the city-state of Carthage. Both had large sedentary populations. The Gaetulians were less settled, with large pastoral elements, and lived in the near south on the margins of the Sahara. The medieval historian of the Maghrib, Ibn Khaldun, is credited or blamed for theorizing a causative dynamic to the different tribal confederacies over time. Issues concerning tribal social-economies and their influence have generated a large literature, which critics say is overblown. Abdallah Laroui discounts the impact of tribes, declaring the subject a form of obfuscation which cloaks suspect colonial ideologies. While Berber tribal society has made an impact on culture and government, their continuance was chiefly due to strong foreign interference which usurped the primary domain of the government institutions, and derailed their natural political development. Rather than there being a predisposition for tribal structures, the Berber's survival strategy in the face of foreign occupation was to figuratively retreat into their own way of life through their enduring tribal networks. On the other hand, as it is accepted and understood, tribal societies in the Middle East have continued over millennia <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> time flourish.|$|E

500|$|The {{literary}} critic John Carey {{suggests that the}} abandonment by intellectuals of [...] "the clerks and the suburbs" [...] as subjects of literary interest provided an opening for writers prepared to exploit this underexplored area. He considers John Betjeman and Stevie Smith as two writers who successfully achieved this. [...] Hammill [...] believes that Gibbons should be named alongside these two, since [...] in her writings she rejects the stereotypical view of suburbia as unexciting, conventional and limited. Instead, says Hammill, [...] "Gibbons's fictional suburbs are socially and architecturally diverse, and her characters—who range from experimental writers to shopkeepers—read and interpret suburban styles and values in varying and incompatible ways". Hammill adds that Gibbons's strong identification with her own suburban home, in which she lived for 53 years, may have influenced her preference to stay outside the mainstream of metropolitan literary life, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> time mock it.|$|E
500|$|The {{impetus to}} produce this film {{appears to have}} been the ability of the Thanhouser crew to capture a {{disaster}} on film. Film historian Q.

[...] It is unknown what particular rail disaster was filmed, but a possible that the accident depicted was in the Bronx on the night of June 1, 1910. That night one stalled train, concealed in smoke from a fire, was struck by another train near the Mott Avenue subway station. One of the composite cars was shredded by the steel cars behind it; there were no fatalities in the accident. Other accidents prior to the film debut occurred in January and February.|$|E

After the Easter holidays he felt more positively about The Temple: [...] "I am making the first chapter a cinema film, and have been writing furiously ever since. I honestly think that it is going to be rather good". He sometimes worked on the book during classes, telling any boys who dared to ask what he was doing that he was writing a history of the Eskimos. By June he felt confident enough to send the first few chapters to his Oxford friend Harold Acton, [...] "asking for criticism and hoping for praise". Earlier that year Waugh had commented warmly on Acton's book of poems, An Indian Ass, [...] "which brought back memories of a life [...] infinitely remote".|$|E
