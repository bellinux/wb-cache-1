5|$|Hosseini has {{commented that}} he {{considers}} The Kite Runner to be a father–son story, emphasizing the familial {{aspects of the}} narrative, an element that he continued to use in his later works. Themes of guilt and redemption feature prominently in the novel, with a pivotal scene depicting an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> against Hassan that Amir fails to prevent. The {{latter half of the}} book centers on Amir's attempts to atone for this transgression by rescuing Hassan's son over two decades later.|$|E

The cattle barons have always used hired guns from Texas to take out {{suspected}} rustlers and scare away the nesters in Wyoming. One particular <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> perpetrated by the Texans was recounted by cowboy John J. Baker, where the Texans ambushed and killed nine trappers whom they mistook for rustlers in Big Dry Creek, Wyoming. They received a $450 bonus for the slaughter.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between Serbs and Croats spread to eastern Slavonia in early 1991. On 1 April, Serb villagers around Vukovar and other towns in eastern Slavonia began to erect barricades across main roads. The White Eagles, a Serbian paramilitary {{group led by}} Vojislav Šešelj, moved into the Serb-populated village of Borovo Selo just north of Vukovar. In mid-April 1991, Armbrust shoulder-launched anti-tank missiles were fired at Borovo Selo. According to one version of the event, missiles were fired at agricultural machinery that served as barricades. According to a second version, three missiles were fired at houses inhabited by Serbs. There were no casualties, but the attack aggravated and deepened ethnic tensions. On 2 May, Serb paramilitaries ambushed two Croatian police buses in the centre of Borovo Selo, killing 12 policemen and injuring 22 more. Three Serbs were also killed. The Battle of Borovo Selo represented the worst <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> between the country's Serbs and Croats since the Second World War. It enraged many Croatians {{and led to a}} surge of ethnic violence across Slavonia.|$|E

50|$|Violence in Buddhism {{refers to}} <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and {{aggression}} committed by Buddhists with religious, political, and socio-cultural motivations. Buddhism is generally seen {{as among the}} religious traditions least associated with violence, but {{in the history of}} Buddhism there have been <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> directed, fomented or inspired by Buddhists.|$|R
50|$|Another {{challenge}} {{is that the}} Political Terror Scale only measures actual violations of physical or integrity rights or <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and therefore countries ruled by truly repressive and coercive regimes may receive low scores. Nations who are successful at oppressing their citizens or who have committed <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> {{in the past to}} deter resistance generally do not have to commit many <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> in order to maintain control. For example, the former USSR would score low on the Political Terror Scale and that score would not reflect the overall level of oppression present in that society.|$|R

The attack was the deadliest <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> against Egypt's Coptic Christians in a decade, since the Kosheh massacre in 2000 left 20 Copts dead. The target of the bombing was the Saints Church, a Coptic church located across the street from the Masjid Sharq El-Madina mosque.|$|E
25|$|The opening {{ceremony}} {{was marred by}} an attack by a drunken 16-year-old wielding a knife, who stabbed {{members of the public}} leaving the ceremony. Forty-one people were wounded, six seriously, before the youth was arrested. According to police, the youth says he cannot remember his <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and is still denying it. One of the first stabbing victims was HIV-positive, leading to worries that other victims may have been infected, although this did not prove to be the case.

At its peak in the early 1970s, it numbered some 7,500 people (80% were of Ashkenazi descent), who lived primarily in the two communities of Salisbury and Bulawayo. Smaller rural communities also existed for short periods in Que Que, Umtali and Gatooma. The community declined {{in part due to}} age, but most Jewish residents in Zimbabwe left after violence and social disruption. In 2007, the local Jewish community had declined to 270. The community had strong links with Israel. In 2003, the Bulawayo Shul was burnt down in an anti-Semitic <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E
25|$|As of 2006, the {{situation}} in Ogoniland has eased significantly, assisted by the transition to democratic rule in 1999. However, no attempts {{were made by the}} government or an international body to bring about justice by investigating and prosecuting those involved in the violence and property destruction that have occurred in Ogoniland. However, Royal Dutch Shell was sued by families of the activists, who accused the company of complicity in the deaths. The company said it never advocated any <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> against the activists and tried to persuade the government to grant clemency. In 2009, the company agreed to an out-of-court settlement with the families, paying them US$15.5 million.|$|E

The other 200 Palestinians besieged inside the Basilica have taken refuge there by force in order to flee from the sweep and search by the Israeli army, just as had happened to the 5 Italian journalists during {{the first day of the}} siege.

The Beast immediately turns on Gaston and is prepared to kill him, but spares his life after seeing the fear in his eyes. The Beast and Belle are reunited, but this reunion is cut short as Gaston fatally stabs the Beast. This <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> causes Gaston to lose his footing and he falls to his death.|$|E
25|$|I wish {{to express}} my heartfelt horror at the {{indiscriminate}} terrorist attacks committed against innocent people of the United States yesterday. While {{it is still not}} clear who carried out the attack, it must be stated that no right-thinking follower of Islam could possibly condone such an action. The Qur'an equates the murder of one innocent person with the murder of the whole of humanity. We pray for the families of all those who lost their lives in this unthinkable <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> as well as all those injured; I hope to reflect the feelings of all Muslims and people around the world whose sympathies go out to the victims of this sorrowful moment.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, at a {{time when}} Nong Samet was being terrorized nightly by violent acts of banditry, local {{policing}} was so ineffective that the bandits could brag about their exploits in the marketplace. Finally, after a particularly blatant <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> three bandits who had identified themselves in the market the day before were found with their throats cut {{at the edge of the}} camp. Banditry decreased significantly in camp after this. Thou Thon thus demonstrated his willingness to use summary execution as a means of maintaining order. This sent a message to the camp population as much as it did to would-be bandits, that security was a priority and that it would be enforced.|$|E
