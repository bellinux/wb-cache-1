5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Barnes & Noble called the writing style fluid and Children's Literature praised {{the story for}} being richly detailed. Kirkus Reviews {{compared}} the story to <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> fantasy elements and characters, then concluded that it, despite being derivative, was exciting and held together well.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} of Nicholas Altomanović's lands created friction between Tvrtko and George of Zeta, since the latter seized coastal župas which Tvrtko {{had expected to}} annex. In early 1377, Tvrtko successfully plotted with the Travunians the takeover of Trebinje, Konavli, and Dračevica, making his final conquests of the Serbian lands. By that time, Serbia {{had been reduced to}} <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> independent lordships.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} eleven seasons of Doctor Who, often the {{surviving}} materials {{are in a}} very different format or condition from their original broadcast masters. Surviving 1960s material is recorded on film stock of varying quality, while early 1970s material is available in <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> professional and consumer formats. To present the material in a form approximating its original broadcast masters requires extensive technical work, and a certain amount of invention.|$|E
50|$|Taxation in the Ottoman Empire changed {{drastically}} over time, and was <b>a</b> complex <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> different taxes, exemptions, {{and local}} customs.|$|R

5|$|Ireland {{continued}} as <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> rival kingdoms but, {{beginning in the}} 7th century, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through {{the concept of a}} High King of Ireland. Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of High Kings stretching back thousands of years but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the century, {{the many}} repairs {{undertaken}} since the memorial's construction had left <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> materials and colours, and a disconcerting pattern of damage from water intrusion at the joints. In May 2001, the Government of Canada announced the Canadian Battlefield Memorials Restoration Project, a major C$30million restoration project to restore Canada's memorial sites in France and Belgium, in order to maintain and present them in a respectful and dignified manner. In 2005, the Vimy memorial closed for major restoration work. Veterans Affairs Canada directed the restoration of the memorial in cooperation with other Canadian departments, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, consultants and specialists in military history.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} for approximately 11,000 years, based on Clovis points discovered in the area. The first inhabitants were most likely the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede tribes of Native Americans, descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia. They fished for salmon, trout, and lamprey, and hunted for deer and elk. They also often set fires to clear brush from prairies and oak savannas, and to promote the growth of certain crops. The fires were limited by the Native Americans, creating <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> burned and unburned land, thus increasing the biodiversity of the watershed.|$|E
50|$|Inland {{wildlife}} areas include Sulby Glen (a rugged grassy glen full of bluebells in spring) and Ballaugh Curragh: <b>a</b> wildlife-rich <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> semi-wilderness, swamp, woodland and agriculture, continuous {{since the}} last Ice Age.|$|R
50|$|The diverse landforms and soils {{support an}} array of {{different}} habitats {{and a large number}} of floral species. <b>A</b> complex <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> forest, woodlands, wetlands, sedges, granite shrublands and coastal heath is found within the park.|$|R
50|$|The {{organisation}} {{have come}} a long way since they began in 1993. Their overall goal now is to build <b>a</b> unique <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> rejuvenated landscapes and communities, to initiate 200 projects and impact on 100,000 children.|$|R
5|$|Some Denver streets have bicycle lanes, leaving <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> disjointed routes {{throughout}} the city. There are over 850 miles of paved, off-road, bike paths in Denver parks and along bodies of water, like Cherry Creek and the South Platte. This {{allows for a}} significant portion of Denver's population to be bicycle commuters and has led to Denver being known as a bicycle-friendly city. Some local residents are very opposed to bike lanes, which have caused some plans to be watered down or nixed. The review process for one bike line on Broadway will last over a year before city council members will make a decision. In addition to the many bike paths, Denver launched B-Cycle– a citywide bicycle sharing program– in late April 2010. The B-Cycle network was the largest in the United States {{at the time of its}} launch, boasting 400 bicycles.|$|E
25|$|The Zapatistas {{claim that}} as {{indigenous}} farmers, {{they are the}} best protectors of the rainforest, and that they want to turn Montes Azules into an “Indian Farmers’ Reserve”, <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> farms and jungle.|$|E
25|$|The {{area was}} <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> mostly Victorian {{buildings}} on a 17th and 18th century layout of streets, alleys, and courts. A map {{used for the}} 1961 meeting of the British Association shows shops fronting Market Street and Cross Street, with warehousing or office buildings behind.|$|E
50|$|The aim is {{to produce}} <b>an</b> uneven <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> short and long {{vegetation}} {{by the end of}} the grazing period, between 8 and 25 cm. This is to allow the devil's bit scabious food plant to grow.|$|R

25|$|According {{to these}} {{scholars}} the Bible includes multiple versions of events.

25|$|By the 2000s, {{the archdiocese}} had long outgrown the 90-year-old Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart. Since it was {{constructed}} as a parish church, {{it had been}} enlarged over the years through <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> renovations and additions and rather than make more costly additions, the Archdiocese decided to construct a new Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the Ottoman Empire {{continued}} to control or have suzerainty (albeit nominal) {{over most of}} the peninsula. Subject to this suzerainty, Arabia was ruled by <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> tribal rulers (including the Al Saud who had returned from exile in 1902 – see below) with the Sharif of Mecca having preeminence and ruling the Hejaz.|$|E
50|$|Nevada {{state law}} allows for {{governance}} of unincorporated towns under two different systems. The Unincorporated Town Government Law, adopted in 1975, applies to counties of 100,000 people or more, {{and any other}} county that opts in. For other counties, <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> system <b>of</b> laws applies.|$|R
50|$|The {{present system}} of high seas {{governance}} {{has evolved over}} a period of several hundred years, the end result being <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> quilt <b>of</b> measures in the form of binding and non-binding instruments with different geographical and legal reaches and different levels of participation.|$|R
25|$|Blue merle (<b>a</b> mottled <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> {{gray and}} black) {{with or without}} tan points or white {{markings}} on the face, collar, legs, chest, underbelly - neither white nor tan points are required. Solid merle dogs are equally desirable as ones with tan or white.|$|R
25|$|In a {{variegated}} landscape, made of <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> closed (woodland) {{and open}} (meadows, cereal crops) environments, most soil-dwelling species are not specialized {{and can be}} found everywhere, but most epigeal and litter-dwelling species are attracted to a particular environment, either forested or not. As a consequence of dispersal limitation, landuse change, when too rapid, may cause the local disappearance of slow-moving, specialist species, a phenomenon the measure of which has been called colonisation credit.|$|E
25|$|Singapore has {{a written}} constitution. The {{text of the}} Singapore Constitution which took effect from 9 August 1965 was <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> {{provisions}} drawn from three statutes: the Constitution of the State of Singapore 1963, the Federal Constitution of Malaysia made applicable to Singapore by the Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965, and the Republic of Singapore Independence Act itself. These provided the newly independent nation with a working constitution at short notice.|$|E
25|$|As part {{of their}} local {{security}} remit, the Canadians built numerous security points and anti-aircraft bases around the town of Bordon, on which tanks and armoured cars were parked, leaving today <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> elderly but still visible concrete slabs. The Canadians had their own fire station, located at the junction of Budds Lane and Station Road, and hence able to access either camp. Canadians also, in part manned the garrison fire station throughout World War II.|$|E
50|$|Haraiki is purportedly uninhabited. However, Google Maps reveals {{there is}} a small {{collection}} of buildings on the north shore (-17.446343,-143.455739) and that the bulk of the land on all three islets has been heavily planted with <b>a</b> grid-like <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> trees or large shrubs.|$|R

50|$|Bophuthatswana was {{the first}} area to be {{declared}} an independent state whose territory constituted <b>a</b> scattered <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> individual enclaves.

25|$|Northern Ireland {{comprises}} <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> communities whose national loyalties {{are represented}} in some areas by flags flown from flagpoles or lamp posts. The Union Jack and the former Northern Ireland flag are flown in many loyalist areas, and the Tricolour, adopted by republicans as the flag of Ireland in 1916,}} is flown in some republican areas. Even kerbstones in some areas are painted red-white-blue or green-white-orange, depending on whether local people express unionist/loyalist or nationalist/republican sympathies.|$|E
25|$|Central Taylor County {{was once}} heavy forest, but by 1896 {{it had been}} logged for thirty years. Instead of the Chequamegon Forest of today, it was <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> cutover slashings, {{occasionally}} scorched by runaway fires. An early settler in that area said it was so open he could see deer a mile from his house. Though a band of towns and farms ran along the Wisconsin Central Railway {{north and south of}} Medford, the rest of the county had large areas with only a smattering of settlers.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of the}} region's history <b>a</b> <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> tribal rulers {{controlled}} most of the area. The Al Saud (the Saudi royal family) {{emerged as}} minor tribal rulers in Najd in central Arabia. From the mid-18th century, imbued with the religious zeal of the Wahhabi Islamic movement, they became aggressively expansionist. Over the following 150 years, {{the extent of the}} Al Saud territory fluctuated. However, between 1902 and 1927, the Al Saud leader, Abdulaziz, carried out a series of wars of conquest which resulted in his establishing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1930.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} {{taxes in the}} Ottoman empire, rav akçesi could be {{affected}} by <b>a</b> complex <b>patchwork</b> <b>of</b> local rules and exemptions, including muafiyet; the Jews of Selanik (Thessaloniki) were among those exempted from taxes by a muafname after the city was conquered by Murad II.|$|R
