2500|$|In the {{confocal}} cavity a ray, {{which is}} deviated {{from its original}} direction in the middle between the of the cavity, is maximally (compared to other cavities) displaced on the return to the middle. This prevents <b>amplified</b> <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emission</b> and is important for a good beam quality and [...] high power amplifiers. In wave optics this is expressed by the eigenvalue degeneration of the modes. On every turn to the left, the 0,0 mode and the 1,0 mode are 90° out of phase, but on the turn back, they are 180° out of phase [...] Interference of the modes then leads to a displacement.|$|E
2500|$|As well as {{decaying}} via stimulated emission, {{electrons in}} the upper energy level can also decay by spontaneous emission, which occurs at random, depending upon the glass structure and inversion level. [...] Photons are emitted spontaneously in all directions, but a proportion of those will be emitted {{in a direction that}} falls within the numerical aperture of the fiber and are thus captured and guided by the fiber. [...] Those photons captured may then interact with other dopant ions, and are thus amplified by stimulated emission. [...] The initial spontaneous emission is therefore amplified {{in the same manner as}} the signals, hence the term <b>Amplified</b> <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>Emission.</b> [...] ASE is emitted by the amplifier in both the forward and reverse directions, but only the forward ASE is a direct concern to system performance since that noise will co-propagate with the signal to the receiver where it degrades system performance. [...] Counter-propagating ASE can, however, lead to degradation of the amplifier's performance since the ASE can deplete the inversion level and thereby reduce the gain of the amplifier.|$|E

40|$|Smith-Purcell {{radiation}} is the emission of electromagnetic radiation by an electron beam passing {{next to an}} optical grating. Recent measurement of relatively intense power of such radiation was observed in the THz-regime [1]. To explain the high intensity and the super-linear dependence on current beyond the threshold {{it was suggested that}} the radiating device operated in the high gain regime, <b>amplifying</b> <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emission</b> (ASE) [1, 2]. We contest this interpretation and suggest an alternative mechanism. According to our interpretation the device operates as a distributed feedback (DFB) laser oscillator, in which a forward going surface wave, excited by the beam on the grating surface, is coupled to a backward going surface wave by a second order Bragg reflection process. This feedback process produces a saturated oscillator. Another plausible mechanism for explaining the experiment [3, 4] is Backward Wave Oscillation (BWO) with a surface wave, accompanied by second harmonic bunching of the e-beam at saturation, and consequent coherent (superradiant) Smith-Purcell radiation. We present analytical models for the two proposed mechanisms, and compare them. The models predict different emission frequencies and angles.

The rib-loaded structure of the waveguides was fabricated by photolithographic and reactive ion etching processes, with patterned rib widths ranging from 1 to 8 µm. Efficient light propagation was observed when end-fire coupling a probe signal both at 633 nm and 780 nm into the waveguides, with attenuation losses as low as 11 dB/cm.

40|$|The Data Vortex {{photonic}} {{packet switching}} architecture {{is designed to}} be a low-latency topology with minimal node complexity and a high degree of scalability [1, 2]. The nodes from which this system is assembled require widebandwidth switching devices with very fast transitioning and minimal signal degradation. Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) have been selected as the most promising active component that fulfills these requirements for the Data Vortex {{as well as for the}} majority of other photonic packet switch fabrics [3]. In tracking switching technologies it is therefore critical to understand how the key physical parameters of the device compare with current commercial SOAs. Additional practical consideration such as the cost and power consumption are also important, and must be addressed. Issues concerning engineering feasibility, mechanical robustness, and reliability, and integratablility should be included in the overall analysis. (A recently-published general guide can be found in the literature [4].) The noise figure (NF) is perhaps the most important feature of a switching device. Measured in decibels (dB), this parameter describes the increase in the noise floor relative to the signal spectrum peak. Because these distortions are cumulative, the size of the Data Vortex network is ultimately limited by this figure [5]. <b>Amplified</b> <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emissions</b> (ASE) is the primary source of this broadband noise component in SOAs [6].

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a theoretical {{study of the}} role of nuclear degrees of freedom in the x-ray absorption, x-ray resonant scattering  and some aspects of the interaction of matter with strong laser fields. Most numerical simulations are performed with a time-dependent wave-packet program that have proved its robustness  in previous investigations. The relevant experimental results are also presented for comparison when available. The first problem considered in the thesis is the possibility of obtaining x-ray absorption spectra with resolution beyond the natural lifetime broadening of the core-excited electronic states. It is shown that the method of measuring x-ray absorptionin the resonant scattering mode suggested earlier for that purpose exhibits severe limitations originating from the lifetime vibrational interference between the intermediate core-excited vibrational levels. However, a broad class of molecules is found for which spectra with super-high resolution can indeed be obtained. These molecules have parallel potential energy surfaces of the core-excited and final states for the x-ray scattering process. The interpretations of two interesting cases of x-ray absorption and Auger scattering follow. The first one is related to scattering through a doubly excited Π state in the CO molecule. A Doppler split feature near 299. 4 eV and strong scattering anisotropy are  observed. Both features are well explained and reproduced by the theory. Next, theelectron-vibrational fine structure of the excitation for O 2 is investigated by means of different models. We are able to single out the electronic states and interpotential crossing points responsible for the peculiar absorption profile. Based on these findings we explain and reproduce the x-ray Auger scattering spectra through the same excitation. Here we encounter a rather unusual situation in which the Auger spectra are affected by three types of the interference: Apart from the lifetime vibrational interference, a strong interference between two intermediate electronic states and an interference with the direct-scattering amplitude is also present. The process of intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) is investigated in the context of formation of <b>amplified</b> <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emissions</b> (ASE) inside laser-pumped gain media. IVR raises to a higher energy region the threshold pump intensity after which blue-shifted ASE is observed. Finally, we suggest a new scheme of x-ray pump-probe spectroscopy based on the core-hole hopping in N 2 induced by an infrared laser field. We investigate the result from the core-hole hoping on the vibrational structure of the x-ray absorption profile. Furthermore, by populating core-excited states with opposite parities, the laser field opens up symmetry forbidden resonant inelastic scattering channels, which can give new insights about the electronic structure of matter.
