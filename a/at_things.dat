5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show {{less attention to}} social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing <b>at</b> <b>things.</b> Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E

She's a little bit more hesitant, a little more cynical". Commentators have mentioned how unusually strong and resilient Fisher is for a female character, and GamesRadar UK called her one of the strongest heroines in video gaming.|$|E

500|$|Fox {{expressed}} a robust attitude to his situation: {{he refused to}} regard himself as disabled, and would not allow anyone to pity him, telling a Toronto radio station that he found life more [...] "rewarding and challenging" [...] since {{he had lost his}} leg. His feat helped redefine Canadian views of disability and the inclusion of the disabled in society. Fox's actions increased the visibility of people with disabilities, and in addition influenced the attitudes of those with disabilities, by showing them disability portrayed in a positive light. Rick Hansen commented that the run challenged society to focus on ability rather than disability. [...] "What was perceived as a limitation became a great opportunity. People with disabilities started looking <b>at</b> <b>things</b> differently. They came away with huge pride", he wrote.|$|E

Upset that Donald Trump won the election, Madonna spoke out against him at the Women's March on Washington, a day after his inauguration. The singer sparked controversy {{when she said that}} she [...] "thought a lot about blowing up the White House".

In February 2017, Madonna adopted four-year-old twin sisters from Malawi named Esther and Stella. In late summer 2017, Madonna moved to Lisbon, Portugal with her adoptive children.|$|E

500|$|Tatiana was {{practical}} {{and had a}} natural talent for leadership. Her sisters gave her the nickname [...] "The Governess" [...] and sent her as their group representative when they wanted their parents to grant a favor. Though she was eighteen months Tatiana's senior, Olga had no objection when Tatiana decided {{to take charge of}} a situation. [...] She was also closer to her mother than any of her sisters and was considered by many who knew her to be the Tsarina's favorite daughter. Tatiana was the conduit of all her mother's decisions. [...] "It was not that her sisters loved their mother any less," [...] recalled her French tutor Pierre Gilliard, [...] "but Tatiana knew how to surround her with unwearying attentions and never gave way to her own capricious impulses." [...] Alexandra wrote Nicholas on 13 March 1916 that Tatiana {{was the only one of}} their four daughters who [...] "grasped it" [...] when she explained her way of looking <b>at</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E
500|$|Due to the father-son {{dynamics}} of the hunting world depicted in the series' first season with the Winchesters, the writers decided to explore a mother-daughter relationship. This resulted in {{the introduction of the}} character Jo Harvelle and her mother Ellen, though the Alex character was eventually renamed Jo. Tal had been a fan of the show, and decided to audition for the role. Since the character was not fully explored during her first few appearances on the show, Tal did not know what her personality would be. Because of the way Jo is introducedthreatening Dean with a rifleTal {{was under the impression that}} the character was an experienced hunter. With this in mind, she decided to portray her as [...] "somewhat confident and cool" [...] by making use of her experience in the Israeli army, where she served for two years. Tal commented, [...] "When I was in the army I was holding my gun and feeling all dangerous and badass. It's an attitude, it's a different kind of walk, and the way you hold yourself, the way you look <b>at</b> <b>things.</b> I tried to put that in there because she didn't say much." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1943, Kesselring {{met with}} Hitler. Kesselring gave an optimistic {{assessment}} {{of the situation in}} Italy and gave reassurances that he could hold the Allies south of Rome on the Winter Line. Kesselring further promised that he could prevent the Allies reaching the Northern Apennines for at least six months. As a result, on 6 November 1943, Hitler ordered Rommel and his Army Group B headquarters to move to France to take charge of the Atlantic Wall and prepare for the Allied attack that was expected there in the spring of 1944. On 21 November 1943, Kesselring resumed command of all German forces in Italy, combining Commander-in-Chief South, a joint command, with that of Army Group C, a ground command. [...] "I had always blamed Kesselring", Hitler later explained, [...] "for looking <b>at</b> <b>things</b> too optimistically ... events have proved Rommel wrong, and I have been justified in my decision to leave Field Marshal Kesselring there, whom I have seen as an incredible political idealist, but also as a military optimist, and it is my opinion that military leadership without optimism is not possible." ...|$|E
