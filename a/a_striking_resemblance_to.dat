5|$|Although van der Weyden did not {{adhere to}} the {{conventions}} of idealisation, he generally sought to flatter his sitters. He depicted his models in highly fashionable clothing, often with rounded—almost sculpted—facial features, some of which deviated from natural representation. He adapted his own aesthetic, and his portraits of women often bear <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} piracy cropped up when a news article {{published}} in The Indian Express exposed {{the dark side of}} the film market. Hardly into weeks of the film's release, CDs were being sold at as low as Rs. 40.

5|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the plot of Cars bears <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> that of Doc Hollywood, the 1991 romantic comedy which stars Michael J. Fox as a hotshot young doctor, who, after causing a traffic {{accident}} in a small town, is sentenced {{to work at the}} town hospital, {{falls in love with a}} local law student and eventually acquires an appreciation for small town values. Some have gone so far as to say that the makers of Cars plagiarized the script of Doc Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest {{may take}} its overall {{structure}} from traditional Italian commedia dell'arte, which sometimes featured a magus and his daughter, their supernatural attendants, {{and a number}} of rustics. The commedia often featured a clown known as Arlecchino (or his predecessor, Zanni) and his partner Brighella, who bear <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> Stephano and Trinculo; a lecherous Neapolitan hunchback who corresponds to Caliban; and the clever and beautiful Isabella, whose wealthy and manipulative father, Pantalone, constantly seeks a suitor for her, thus mirroring the relationship between Miranda and Prospero.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} conducted unearthed square or circular Chera coins made {{of copper}} from near Cochin. This {{was for the}} first time, from a stratographic context, coins of Sangam Chera period {{have been found in}} Kerala. The coin, which is almost a square in shape, has an elephant facing to the right and some symbols towards the top of the coin. The symbols could not be identified as {{the upper part of the}} coin was partially corroded. A drawn bow and arrow was visible on the other side. Below the arrow is an elephant goad (a prod used to control elephants). These coins bear <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> the ones excavated from Karur in Tamil Nadu, said the archaeologists.|$|E

Meanwhile, Seishu gains a new assistant coach {{in the form of}} Yūhei's older brother Junpei, after Ichiyo agrees to marry him if Seishu makes it to Koshien.|$|E
5|$|Cross-linguistically, the-ma suffix may {{be related}} to a coverbial suffix in Jaminjung, a {{language}} in which coverb roots occur without any aspect markers, but are then suffixed with -mayan, which marks continuous aspect. This coverb suffix bears <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> the sum of the Wagiman -ma suffix and the continuous aspect suffix -yan, which always occur in tandem on coverbs. Together, -ma and -yan perform the same semantic function as Jaminjung -mayan. Precisely what the relationship holds between these suffixes; whether one language borrowed from the other, or whether each language inherited them from earlier languages, is not at all clear.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Christiaan Schuckman {{discovered}} {{a set of}} signed plates in Madrid that {{can be attributed to}} the engraver of the First Folio portrait. These plates bear Droeshout's signature and are stylistically similar to his portrait of Shakespeare. (They include a portrait of the priest and writer Franciso de la Peña that has <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> the English poet). On the evidence of these plates, which were made between 1635 and 1639, Schuckman attributed the portrait of Shakespeare to the younger Martin and suggested that the engraver had converted to Catholicism and emigrated to Spain in 1635, where he continued to work.|$|E
50|$|In February 2004, an {{individual}} with <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> physical <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> Fisher was arrested in Vancouver, British Columbia by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

5|$|The club crest {{has been}} a rampant lion since 1936, which was also {{introduced}} by Charlie Hewitt. There have been many variations of the lion; {{the first was a}} single red lion, often mistakenly said to be chosen because of the club's Scottish roots. The lion bore <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> signs used by pubs named The Red Lion. From 1956 to 1974 Millwall's crest was two leaping red lions facing each other. Former chairman Theo Paphitis brought back the badge in 1999, where it was used for a further eight years. The current crest is a leaping lion, which first appeared on a Millwall kit in 1979. It remained until 1999 and was re-introduced again in 2007. The club mascot is a giant lion called Zampa, so named after Zampa Road, the postal address of The Den.|$|E
5|$|Another {{defense that}} often uses color or shape to deceive {{potential}} enemies is mimicry. A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> wasps, which helps them avoid predation {{even though the}} beetles are in fact harmless. Batesian and Müllerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model). Such a mimicry complex {{is referred to as}} Batesian and is most commonly known by the mimicry by the limenitidine viceroy butterfly of the inedible danaine monarch. Later research has discovered that the viceroy is, in fact more toxic than the monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of Müllerian mimicry. In Müllerian mimicry, inedible species, usually within a taxonomic order, find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators who need to learn about the insects' inedibility. Taxa from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well known Müllerian complexes.|$|E
5|$|Temples {{built in}} and around the Kalyani region (in the Bidar district) were quite {{different}} from those built in other regions. Without exception, the articulation was nagara, and the temple plan as a rule was either stepped-diamond or stellate. The elevations corresponding to these two plans were similar because star shapes were produced by rotating the corner projections of a standard stepped plan in increments of 11.25 degrees, resulting in a 32-pointed interrupted plan in which three star points are skipped in the centre of each side of the shrine. Examples of stepped-diamond plans surviving in Karnataka are the Dattatreya Temple at Chattarki, the Someshvara Temple in Kadlewad, and the Mallikarjuna and Siddhesvara at Kalgi in the Gulbarga district. The nagara shrine at Chattarki is a stepped diamond of projecting corners with five projections per side. Because of the stepped-diamond plan, the wall pillars have two fully exposed sides, with a high base block decorated with a mirrored stalk motif and two large wall images above. The shapes and decorations {{on the rest of the}} wall pillar have <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> the actual pillars supporting the ceiling.|$|E
25|$|In February 2004, an {{individual}} with <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> physical <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> Fisher was arrested in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Fingerprints eventually confirmed {{that he was not}} Fisher. He was held by Canadian police for approximately one week until a family member correctly identified him. The FBI alerted local law enforcement in 2012 that Fisher may be living in the Payson area in Gila County.|$|R
5000|$|Eric Wood (born March 18, 1986) is an American {{football}} {{center for}} the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL).

25|$|The {{style of}} {{handwriting}} of the codex bears <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> general <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> that of three Gospel lectionaries of the 10th and 11th centuries: Lectionary 296, ℓ 1599, and ℓ 3. The letters and words are not separated {{from one another}} (scriptio-continua). There is frequent insertion of a point as a mark of interpunction.

50|$|Double Diamond is a cheap popular {{brand of}} {{filtered}} cigars. These cigars are predominantly natural tobacco mixed {{with many other}} additives. The cigars have <b>a</b> similar <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> regular cigarettes and are sold in packs of 20 like most other major brands of cigarettes. Although there are many rumors that these cigars are healthier than regular cigarettes, they are actually much worse for the human body, especially the lungs. However, the nicotine content in Double Diamonds is very mild and nicotine addiction {{is less likely to}} occur if smoked in moderation.|$|R

50|$|Andrzej Seweryn {{appeared}} in over fifty motion pictures, most them Polish, French and German productions. He {{is best known}} in the United States for his portrayal as Julian Scherner in the film Schindler's List.

25|$|As a {{scientific}} adviser during the voyage, Harriot {{was asked by}} Raleigh {{to find the most}} efficient way to stack cannonballs on the deck of the ship. His ensuing theory about the close-packing of spheres shows <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> atomism and modern atomic theory, which he was later accused of believing. His correspondence about optics with Johannes Kepler, in which he described some of his ideas, later influenced Kepler's conjecture.|$|E
25|$|Some {{have noted}} the {{similarity}} of Obama's campaign logo to others, namely those of Vietin Bank, The Sidney Hillman Foundation, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
