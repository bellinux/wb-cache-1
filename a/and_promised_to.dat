5|$|The {{build-up}} {{towards a}} war involving Lombards, Gepids, and Byzantines started possibly in 548 or 549, with Audoin and Thurisind each sending an embassy to Justinian's court at Constantinople, {{in attempts to}} obtain military support from Justinian or at least, {{in the case of}} Thurisind, to get a pledge of neutrality. To sway Justinian, Thurisind's envoys reminded him of their long tradition of alliance <b>and</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> fight against Byzantium's enemies. However, the emperor sided with the Lombards; he made them formal allies <b>and</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> provide troops against the Gepids. From Justinian's perspective, this war was of major importance in the larger context of the Gothic War, because possession of Pannonia was strategically necessary to keep open land communications between Italy and the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First Crusade, Crusader armies assembled at Constantinople <b>and</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> return to the Byzantine Empire any land they might conquer. However, Bohemond, the son of Alexios' former enemy Robert Guiscard, claimed the Principality of Antioch for himself. Alexios did not recognize the legitimacy of the Principality, and Bohemond went to Europe looking for reinforcements. He launched into open warfare against Alexios, but he was soon forced to surrender and negotiate with Alexios at the imperial camp at Diabolis (Devol), where the Treaty was signed.|$|E
