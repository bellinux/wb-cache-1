5|$|Traditionally a pro-market {{economy and}} pro-EU centre-right party, the NCP were the largest {{party in the}} {{parliament}} {{for the first time}} in its history, though losing seats since the 2007 election.

Despite being founded as a primarily conservative party, an analysis on the party's programmes made by an NCP-affiliated think tank concluded that in the 2000s the liberal wing had gained the upper hand and had started to change the party's political ideology. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> conference in 2010, the NCP delegates voted in favour of legalising same-sex marriage. The party's supporters are also generally very supportive of market economy, nuclear power and Finland's admission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.|$|E
