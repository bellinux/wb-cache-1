5|$|The AWS has <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> {{at times}} and reaches peak {{performance}} with the owner who is dedicated to teaching the dog just {{what is expected of}} it. The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills. However, members of the breed can may have issues with food possessiveness. They can be stubborn, and mentally are slow to mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.|$|E

At one point it enters his classroom, causing an uproar from his classmates. The noise alerts the principal, who becomes angry with him and locks him up in his office until school is over. At another, he and the balloon encounter a little girl (Sabine Lamorisse) with a blue balloon that also seems to have <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> too, as evidenced by its act of following his.|$|E
25|$|A boastful donkey {{refuses to}} behave or obey {{the orders of}} its masters. Having <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own,</b> it leaves {{whatever}} master it has and manages to wander through Judea. Sheltering in the stable in Bethlehem, it witnesses the birth of Jesus, the shepherds, the three wise men and the visitation of an angel. Inspecting the presents left by the three wise men for something to eat, the baby Jesus touches the donkey's ear and its character is transformed. It becomes the donkey that takes Joseph, Mary and Jesus into Egypt, once knowing by instinct when Herod's soldiers are near and hiding them.|$|E

Most {{of the film}} was shot at Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for James Cameron's 1997 film Titanic. Some of the sets were designed {{so that they could}} be submerged, while others were built on sound stages with fishtanks used as windows. At Fox Baja Studios, the cast worked with sharks that were either animatronic or computer generated. As the shark used in Jaws was 25 feet long, Harlin decided to increase their animatronic shark to 26 feet. Jackson recalled, [...] "When they first brought it into the lab we were all in awe of the size of this machine [...] It was a real monster. I would walk up to it slowly and touch it and they said it felt like a real shark. The gills moved and it had <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> sometimes." [...] As an added homage to Jaws, the license plate pulled from the shark's teeth by Carter is the same plate found in the tiger shark carcass from Spielberg's film.|$|E
500|$|Marceline the Vampire Queen (voiced by Olivia Olson) {{approaches}} Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) {{and asks}} her to cure {{her of her}} vampirism, as she no longer wants to be immortal. Bubblegum agrees to perform an experimental procedure which extracts the vampiric essence from Marceline's body, but is unsure of whether it has worked or not. As Marceline recovers, the extracted essence gains <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> and escapes. Meanwhile, Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) and Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) are called out to investigate livestock being attacked by a bloodsucking creature. Suspecting Marceline, Finn and Jake confront of her, only to discover the extracted essence has transformed into the vampire attacking the livestock. However, as Finn and Jake chase the vampire, a mob of angry villagers capture Marceline and leave her to be destroyed by the rising sun. As the light engulfs her body, Marceline begins reliving memories of her past. As a child, she's comforted by a lullaby sung by her mother (voiced by Rebecca Sugar), entitled [...] "Everything Stays." [...] She witnesses Simon leaving her {{to protect her from}} himself. As a teenager, she hunts vampires and discovers she can absorb their powers. Later she befriends a tribe of Hyoomans, who are constructing a boat to escape the continent and avoid an impending catastrophe they fear will happen. Marceline helps fight off more vampires, and tells the Hyoomans to flee when the Vampire King arrives. Back in the present, everybody is shocked when they see that the sunlight doesn't kill Marceline, meaning that she has been cured of her vampirism. Meanwhile, Jake encounters the vampires Marceline had previously killed, now resurrected from Marceline's freed vampiric essence.|$|E

Their music [...] "combines elements from rock, dance, electronic, soul, punk, pop, and jazz music to engage {{the body and the}} mind".

According to an AllMusic album review, [...] "This is fine, well-crafted music from a group with <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own".

Madden further praised the remastering, writing the track [...] "breathes easy during the verses and ascends {{elsewhere in the}} song", along with [...] "illuminating Page's touch and Bonham's haymakers". When reviewing the added bonus tracks of the Deluxe Edition, Madden further praised the new version of [...] "Thank You", titled [...] "Thank You (Backing Track)", writing the track [...] "magnifies the song's tasteful sheen, popping with Bonham’s drums and Jones’ organ, {{which seems to have}} <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own." ...|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] "self-organizing" [...] {{was used}} by Immanuel Kant in his 1790 Critique of Judgment, where he argued that {{teleology}} is a meaningful concept only if there exists such an entity whose parts or [...] "organs" [...] are simultaneously ends and means.

2500|$|Although Priapus is {{commonly}} associated with the failed attempts of rape against the nymphs Lotis and Vesta in Ovid’s comedy Fasti and the rather flippant treatment of the deity in urban settings, Priapus' protection traits {{can be traced back}} to the importance placed on the phallus in ancient times (particularly his association with fertility and garden protection). [...] In Greece, the phallus was thought of to have <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own,</b> animal-like, separate from the mind and control of the man. [...] The phallus is also associated with [...] "possession and territorial demarcation" [...] in many cultures, attributing to Priapus' other role as a navigational deity.|$|E
2500|$|Blake's devotees {{are not a}} band of [...] "Merry Men".

Later additions were: a naive weapons expert (Dayna), a mercenary (Tarrant), a gunslinger (Soolin) and an obsequious computer (Slave). While Blake intends to use Liberator to strike against the Federation, the others are often reluctant soldiers—especially Avon. Blake and Avon's clashes over the command represent a conflict between idealism and cynicism, emotion and rationality, and dreams and practicality.|$|E
5000|$|David-Néel {{wrote of}} the tulpa's ability to develop <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own: [...] "Once the tulpa is endowed with enough {{vitality}} {{to be capable of}} playing the part of a real being, it tends to free itself from its maker's control. This, say Tibetan occultists, happens nearly mechanically, just as the child, when his body is completed and able to live apart, leaves its mother's womb." [...] David-Néel claimed to have created a tulpa in the image of a jolly Friar Tuck-like monk which later developed a life <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own and had to be destroyed. David-Néel raised the possibility that her experience was illusory: [...] "I may have created my own hallucination", though she reports that others could see the thoughtforms that have been created.|$|R

40|$|Book synopsis: In this book, {{published}} in 1686, the scientist Robert Boyle (1627 – 91) attacked prevailing {{notions of the}} natural world which depicted 'Nature' as a wise, benevolent and purposeful being. Boyle, one of the leading mechanical philosophers of his day, believed that the world was best understood as a vast, impersonal machine, fashioned by an infinite, personal God. In this cogent treatise, he drew on his scientific findings, his knowledge of contemporary medicine and his deep reflection on theological and philosophical issues, arguing that it was inappropriate both theologically and scientifically to speak of Nature as if it had <b>a</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own: instead, the only true efficient causes of things were the properties and powers given to matter by God. As such, A Free Enquiry into the Vulgarly Received Notion of Nature represents one of the subtlest statements concerning the philosophical issues raised by the mechanical philosophy to emerge from the period of the scientific revolution...|$|R
