60|$|He {{was carried}} <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{but his face}} darkened swiftly.|$|E
60|$|He turned <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{struggling}} with the emotion which she had roused in him.|$|E
60|$|She shrank <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> After all, {{she was a}} woman, and I hated Ray for his brutality.|$|E
60|$|He moved <b>away,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Hetty and Miss Schuyler did {{not look}} at one another. Then Hetty stood up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you mind}} just running <b>away</b> <b>for</b> half <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> Jerry?" [...] she said winningly. [...] "I {{want to say}} {{something}} to uncle Peter." ...|$|R
6000|$|Andrew looked <b>away</b> seaward <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Was it his fancy, or {{was there}} indeed a slim white figure coming across the marshes from the Hall? ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was playing}} with the papers on the table, her face turned <b>away.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> she did not speak.|$|E
6000|$|Her voice died <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> in faint, breathless murmurings. She {{struggled}} to recover it, and repeated in a whisper: ...|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Her tone, {{when she}} replied, {{was meant to}} convey some slight {{annoyance}} at the question.|$|E
60|$|The {{young lady}} {{stepped into a}} car, which whirled <b>away</b> rapidly. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> he was nearly paralyzed at his loss; then he started after the car {{as fast as he}} could go, and this was very fast indeed--he being a woggle-bug.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>away</b> from me <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> My {{question}} {{seemed to}} disconcert her, perhaps {{by reason of}} its directness.|$|R
60|$|The Blythe {{children}} {{went up to}} Ingleside, except Jem, who slipped <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> on <b>a</b> solitary expedition to a remote corner of Rainbow Valley. Mayflowers grew there and Jem never forgot to take his mother a bouquet {{as long as they}} lasted.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a dear he {{must have}} been to have remembered and to have been so faithful!" [...] Philippa observed, looking <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sir Henry {{turned slowly}} <b>away.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> his face darkened {{as his eyes}} met Lessingham's. He seemed about to speak but changed his mind.|$|E
60|$|Douglas looked {{steadily}} <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> He had not {{yet come}} to that stage when he could speak of her lightly as a casual friend.|$|E
60|$|Wrayson lit {{his cigar}} with fingers which {{scarcely}} shook. He threw the match <b>away</b> and smoked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in silence.|$|R
60|$|George {{scanned the}} {{approaches}} to the balcony <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sight of Albert as the shipwrecked mariner scans the horizon for the passing sail. It was inevitable, he supposed, this waiting. It {{would be difficult for}} Maud to slip <b>away</b> even <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> on such <b>a</b> night.|$|R
60|$|Coningsby, in fact, was {{exhausted}} {{by all the}} agitation of the day, and all the harassing spectres of the future. He found wine a momentary solace. He ordered the servants <b>away,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> felt <b>a</b> degree of wild satisfaction {{in the company of}} the brother of Edith.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] And Dora turned <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> They were {{on their}} way to the dining room and the others were {{temporarily}} out of hearing.|$|E
60|$|The music died <b>away.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> the {{tortured}} air quivered in comparative silence; then the girl's voice spoke again. She had, however, selected another topic of conversation.|$|E
60|$|She looked hastily <b>away.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Brooks met her eyes, and {{his heart}} gave an unusual leap. Lady Caroom watched them both thoughtfully, {{and then turned to}} their host.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your friend," [...] she said, [...] "has gone <b>away.</b> He stood <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in {{the doorway}} like Banquo's ghost, and then he disappeared." ...|$|R
60|$|Felix hurried <b>away.</b> Wolfenden {{remained}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{standing in}} the middle of the pavement looking blankly along Piccadilly. Harcutt crossed over to him.|$|R
60|$|With a swoop of {{his long}} arm he {{snatched}} French's gun <b>away,</b> examined it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> looked at French and shook his head.|$|R
60|$|Lord Langerdale's whole {{appearance}} {{was that of}} a man strongly agitated. He turned his head <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and the long, white fingers which supported it were shaking visibly.|$|E
60|$|The face of {{the former}} bully became a study. His eyes grew moist and his lips quivered. He had to turn <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> for he could not control himself.|$|E
60|$|Yates {{released}} his hold {{and everybody in}} the crowd backed <b>away.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> the bronco stood stock-still, his eyes gazing straight ahead. Then he gave a vigorous shake and {{took a few steps}} forward.|$|E
6000|$|MISS GILPIN (turns to Eileen with {{a forced}} smile). I won't steal him <b>away</b> <b>for</b> more than <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> Eileen. (Eileen smiles happily.) ...|$|R
60|$|Edith drew it {{suddenly}} <b>away,</b> and, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{looked at her}} with the same strange dread (there was a sort of wild avoidance in it) as before; but she presently said, 'Nothing, nothing. A blow.' And then she said, 'My Florence!' and then her bosom heaved, and she was weeping passionately.|$|R
60|$|They had {{no further}} {{conversation}} for another hour. The poplars rustled {{behind them and}} the grass rippled and clashed, but now and then the breeze died <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> {{and there was a}} curious and almost disconcerting stillness. At last, in one of these intervals, the Canadian, partly rising, lifted his hand.|$|R
60|$|After this {{there was}} {{a few minutes of}} silence. Henry watched the nine redmen as never before. Several faced him, but now they turned <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and he communicated that fact to Sam Barringford.|$|E
60|$|She {{raised her}} glass and drained it. A woman had entered who {{reminded}} him of Elizabeth, and his eyes had wandered <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> as Beatrice pledged him. She called him back a little impatiently.|$|E
6000|$|The lawyer nodded. [...] "I don't want {{to detain}} you, Deane," [...] he said. [...] "Send your {{secretary}} <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> there's a good fellow. What I {{have to say}} can be said in half-a-dozen words if we are alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned her}} face <b>away,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> neither stirred. Then drawing his head to its former resting-place she touched it very tenderly, seeing how many white threads shone among the brown; and as her hand went to and fro with an inexpressibly {{soothing}} gesture, she said, in a tone whose quietude controlled his agitation like a spell-- ...|$|R
60|$|Cut Finger {{thereafter}} spoke no word, did {{not even}} look back, though Curtis detected him turning his head whenever {{the sound of the}} galloping horse grew faint or died <b>away</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments.</b> The baby ceased to wail, and on the rough ground, when the wagon jarred, the father held the little one high as in a sling.|$|R
60|$|Madame de Florac. My husband always {{likes that}} I should {{be present at}} his dinner. Pardon me, young people, that I have been <b>away</b> from you <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
