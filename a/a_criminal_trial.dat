5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Amendment guards against {{unreasonable}} {{searches and}} seizures, along with requiring any warrant to be judicially sanctioned {{and supported by}} probable cause. It was adopted {{as a response to}} the abuse of the writ of assistance, which is a type of general search warrant, in the American Revolution. Search and seizure (including arrest) must be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court, usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it. The amendment is the basis for the exclusionary rule, which mandates that evidence obtained illegally cannot be introduced into <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>trial.</b> The amendment's interpretation has varied over time; its protections expanded under left-leaning courts such as that headed by Earl Warren and contracted under right-leaning courts such as that of William Rehnquist.|$|E
5|$|The only {{objection}} is, {{not that}} the Court acted beyond its jurisdiction, but that it erred in its judgment of the law applicable to the case. If, then, we are to give any relief in this case, it is by a revision of {{the opinion of the}} Court, given in the course of <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>trial,</b> and thus asserting a right to control its proceedings, and take from them the conclusive effect which the law intended to give them. If this were an application for a habeas corpus, after judgment on an indictment for an offence within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, it could hardly be maintained, that this court could revise such a judgment, or the proceedings which led to it, or set it aside, and discharge the prisoner.|$|E

25|$|With {{respect to}} the failure to pay U.S. federal income tax, some tax protesters miss the {{distinction}} between civil and criminal liability. A verdict of acquittal in <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>trial</b> for non-payment of income tax does not relieve a defendant of civil liability (i.e., the legal obligation to pay the tax). After a criminal acquittal, the IRS can continue to seek money through levy or other lawful means. Generally, {{the amount of money}} due to the IRS is determined administratively by the IRS, and not in <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>trial.</b> (The amount of tax may, however, be calculated after the guilty verdict is reached in a criminal case—for purposes of determining the severity of the sentence.) Although there have been several well-publicized cases of acquittal in a criminal tax case, the IRS continues collection efforts, with many defendants finally seeking refuge in bankruptcy court.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>trial</b> can be {{regarded}} as either or both of two decision processes: guilty vs not guilty or evidence vs a threshold ("beyond a reasonable doubt").

25|$|The company {{suffered}} {{financial difficulties}} in 1985, a company investigation uncovered fraud, {{culminating in the}} dismissal of company director Frank E. Peters. A British political controversy ensued, with its focus upon the fraud and the WDA's investment practices. Peters was extradited to Britain to face <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>trial,</b> but was acquitted of all charges. The company became bankrupt due to financial and market pressures, and its assets were later sold for £1.25 million. Peters was subject to a United States court case in 2007; the charges included conspiracy, fraudulently inflating the value of security to a bank, bank fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud.|$|E

25|$|If the {{business}} information {{was produced in}} the course of a domestic criminal investigation, then either one of the above five categories (for absent witnesses) must apply, or the person producing the statement cannot be expected now to have any recollection of the original information. A typical example of this is doctor's notes in relation to an injured person, which is then adduced as medical evidence in <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>trial.</b> Previous criminal records can be adduced (if otherwise admissible) under this section, but not normally any further details about the method of commission, unless it can be demonstrated that the data inputter had the appropriate personal knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, a {{continuance}} may {{be granted}} {{in a criminal}} case if there is good reason documents pertinent to the case could not be produced at the time of trial. For example, a continuance should be granted for failure to produce a transcript of testimony given at a previous trial. In general, it is reversible error to proceed with <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>trial</b> {{in the absence of a}} previous trial transcript, when such contains pertinent information that should have been considered in the new trial. In these cases, a continuance is the usual remedy. The trial judge or magistrate is the one who issues the continuance.|$|E

The charges stemmed from incidents that occurred on September 19 and 21, 2010.
