5|$|The {{immature}} plumages of <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern</b> {{were originally}} described as separate species, Sterna portlandica and Sterna pikei.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southern}} part of their range, the <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern</b> has been reducing in numbers. Much of this is due to lack of food. However, most of these birds' range is extremely remote, with no apparent trend in the species as a whole.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Arctic</b> <b>terns</b> {{protect their}} {{offspring}} extremely aggressively by very quick drop-downs from a stationary flight over their enemies. Other birds often {{benefit from this}} behavior by breeding {{very close to the}} <b>Arctic</b> <b>terns.</b>|$|R

5|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern</b> has {{appeared}} on the postage stamps of several countries and dependent territories. The territories include the Åland Islands, Alderney, and Faroe Islands. Countries include Canada, Finland, Iceland, and Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{navigation}} is {{the ability}} of many animals to find their way accurately without maps or instruments. Birds such as the <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern,</b> insects such as the monarch butterfly and fish such as the salmon regularly migrate thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds, and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern</b> has a {{continuous}} worldwide circumpolar breeding distribution; {{there are no}} recognized subspecies. It {{can be found in}} coastal regions in cooler temperate parts of North America and Eurasia during the northern summer. During the southern summer, it can be found at sea, reaching the northern edge of the Antarctic ice.|$|E

5|$|<b>Arctic</b> <b>terns</b> usually migrate {{sufficiently}} far offshore {{that they}} are rarely seen from land outside the breeding season.|$|R
50|$|The island's 370 m cliffs {{are home}} to {{numerous}} birds, including <b>Arctic</b> <b>terns,</b> red-throated divers and great skuas.|$|R
5|$|This bird's closest {{relatives}} are {{a group of}} South Polar species, the South American (Sterna hirundinacea), Kerguelen (S. virgata), and Antarctic (S. vittata) terns. On the wintering grounds, the <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern</b> can be distinguished from these relatives; the six-month difference in moult is the best clue here, with Arctic terns being in winter plumage during the southern summer. The southern species also do not show darker wingtips in flight.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern</b> {{is similar}} to the common and roseate terns, its colouring, profile, and call are {{slightly}} different. Compared to the common tern, it has a longer tail and mono-coloured bill, while the main differences from the roseate are its slightly darker colour and longer wings. The Arctic tern's call is more nasal and rasping than that of the common, and is easily distinguishable from that of the roseate.|$|E
5|$|Most tern {{species are}} declining in numbers {{due to the}} loss or {{disturbance}} of breeding habitat, pollution and increased predation. Gull populations have increased {{over the last century}} because of reduced persecution and the availability of food from human activities, and terns have been forced out of many traditional nesting areas by the larger birds. A few species are defying the trend and showing local increases, including the <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern</b> in Scandinavia, Forster's tern around the Great Lakes, the Sandwich tern in eastern North America and its yellow-billed subspecies, the Cayenne tern, in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|<b>Arctic</b> <b>terns</b> {{sometimes}} dip down to {{the surface}} of the water to catch prey close to the surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that <b>Arctic</b> <b>terns</b> may, in spite of their small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|R
50|$|It is an {{important}} breeding site for Canada Geese and Semipalmated Plovers. It {{is also home to}} resident willow ptarmigans and <b>Arctic</b> <b>terns.</b>|$|R
50|$|Species seen: flowers (viper's bugloss, birds-foot trefoil, restharrow, hedge woundwort, marsh cinquefoil), toads, sandhoppers, water vole, puffins, <b>Arctic</b> <b>terns,</b> kittiwakes, shags and guillemots.|$|R
5|$|The diet of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern</b> varies {{depending}} on location and time, but is usually carnivorous. In most cases, it eats small fish or marine crustaceans. Fish species comprise {{the most important part}} of the diet, and account for more of the biomass consumed than any other food. Prey species are immature (1–2-year old) shoaling species such as herring, cod, sandlances, and capelin. Among the marine crustaceans eaten are amphipods, crabs and krill. Sometimes, these birds also eat molluscs, marine worms, or berries, and on their northern breeding grounds, insects.|$|E
5|$|The terns are {{birds of}} open {{habitats}} that typically breed in noisy colonies and {{lay their eggs}} on bare ground {{with little or no}} nest material. Marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats, and a few species build simple nests in trees, on cliffs or in crevices. The white tern, uniquely, lays its single egg on a bare tree branch. Depending on the species, one to three eggs make up the clutch. Most species feed on fish caught by diving from flight, but the marsh terns are insect-eaters, and some large terns will supplement their diet with small land vertebrates. Many terns are long-distance migrants, and the <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern</b> may see more daylight in a year than any other animal.|$|E
25|$|Animals {{move for}} a variety of reasons, such as to find food, a mate, a {{suitable}} microhabitat, or to escape predators. For many animals, the ability to move is essential for survival and, as a result, natural selection has shaped the locomotion methods and mechanisms used by moving organisms. For example, migratory animals that travel vast distances (such as the <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern)</b> typically have a locomotion mechanism that costs very little energy per unit distance, whereas non-migratory animals that must frequently move quickly to escape predators are likely to have energetically costly, but very fast, locomotion.|$|E
50|$|Bird species {{recorded}} in the harbor are Pelagic cormorant, pigeon guillemot, horned puffin, common eider, black scoter, <b>Arctic</b> <b>terns,</b> glaucous gulls and White wagtails.|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} known for its bird life, {{including}} corncrakes, <b>Arctic</b> <b>terns,</b> gannets, corn buntings and Manx shearwaters. The RSPB has a nature reserve at Balranald.|$|R
5000|$|Sights on {{the island}} include the Vat of Kirbister, a natural arch {{described}} as the [...] "finest in Orkney" [...] and various seabirds amongst which are <b>Arctic</b> <b>terns.</b>|$|R
25|$|The area {{is known}} for its {{diversity}} of birds, with 212 species having been recorded as of 1987. Of these, 68 commonly breed, 30 breed occasionally, and 14 which have bred previously. Common birds include the black-throated loon, the bean goose and various species of ducks. Egg-gathering was previously popular from the common goldeneye. Common predator birds include the rough-legged buzzard and merlin, while the white-tailed eagle and golden eagle are less common. The short-eared owl is the most common owl. Waders are abundant along the river, the most common being common ringed plover, ruff and spotted redshank. Other common birds are the common gull, <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern</b> and sparrows.|$|E
25|$|There are 33 {{species of}} fish in the waters, none of which are {{abundant}} or commercially exploitable. The most common are polar cod, which reach lengths of , and liparidae. There are no endemic species within the archipelago. Forty-one species of birds have been documented in the archipelago, of which fourteen breed. These are dominated by seabirds such as fulmar, kittiwake, Brünnich's guillemot, black guillemot and little auk are common throughout the archipelago, while seven other species prefer nesting on flat tundra: common eider, purple sandpiper, Arctic skua, glaucous gull, ivory gull, <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern</b> and snow bunting. Some ivory gulls, little auks and Brünnich's guillemots opt to spend the winter on the islands.|$|E
25|$|Ulva {{is known}} for its wildlife, which is usual for many Scottish islands, {{includes}} many varieties of seabirds. A number of raptors breed on the island including buzzards, golden eagles and sea eagles. Game birds include snipe, grouse, pheasant, and woodcock. White-tailed eagles, which were reintroduced in the nearby Island of Rùm have migrated to Mull, where they now have a stronghold - they can occasionally be seen on Ulva, but are not known to nest there. Ravens also breed here. Puffin, black-legged kittiwakes, shag, common and <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern,</b> gannets, eider ducks, oystercatchers, curlews, redshanks, red-breasted mergansers and gulls nest on the island and the surrounding waters provide a livelihood for numerous seabirds. Occasional visitors (usually not breeding) include - house martins, Leach's storm petrel, corncrakes (which are rare in the British Isles), peregrine falcons and spotted flycatchers.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species of}} birds, {{including}} yellow-billed loons, king eiders, <b>Arctic</b> <b>terns,</b> black-legged kittiwakes, glaucous and Sabine's gulls, king eiders, long-tailed ducks, and red phalaropes, {{are found in}} Smith Bay.|$|R
50|$|The nationally rare plant {{bur chervil}} {{can also be}} found in {{significant}} abundance on Swan Island. Small numbers of both Sandwich and <b>Arctic</b> <b>terns</b> also breed at this site.|$|R
50|$|It lays 2-3 eggs in {{a ground}} scrape. It {{sometimes}} nests among <b>Arctic</b> <b>terns,</b> which, like most white terns, are fiercely defensive of their nest and young and will attack large predators.|$|R

Like most terns, the <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern</b> has high aspect ratio wings and a tail with a deep fork.|$|E
500|$|Terns have a {{worldwide}} distribution, breeding on all continents including Antarctica. The northernmost and southernmost breeders are the <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern</b> and Antarctic tern respectively. Many terns breeding in temperate zones are long-distance migrants, and the <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern</b> probably sees more annual daylight {{than any other}} animal as it migrates from its northern breeding grounds to Antarctic waters, a return journey of more than [...] A common tern that hatched in Sweden and was found dead five months later on Stewart Island, New Zealand, must have flown at least [...] Actual flight distances are, of course, {{much greater than the}} shortest possible route. Arctic terns from Greenland were shown by radio geolocation to average [...] on their annual migrations.|$|E
500|$|Seabird {{migration}} {{is similar in}} pattern {{to those of the}} waders and waterfowl. Some, such as the black guillemot Cepphus grylle and some gulls, are quite sedentary; others, such as most terns and auks breeding in the temperate northern hemisphere, move varying distances south in the northern winter. The <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern</b> Sterna paradisaea has the longest-distance migration of any bird, and sees more daylight than any other, moving from its Arctic breeding grounds to the Antarctic non-breeding areas. One <b>Arctic</b> <b>tern,</b> ringed (banded) as a chick on the Farne Islands off the British east coast, reached Melbourne, Australia in just three months from fledging, a sea journey of over [...] [...] Many tubenosed birds breed in the southern hemisphere and migrate north in the southern winter.|$|E
