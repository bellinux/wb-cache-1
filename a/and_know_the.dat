5|$|As Hondo {{began to}} regenerate, Mauritius and Réunion were placed under {{a state of}} alert. Residents in Réunion were advised to stay up to date with the latest {{warnings}} on the storm, not go hiking in the mountains, ensure their disaster kit is fully stocked, {{stay away from the}} shore, <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> locations of the nearest shelters. Initially, residents in Madagascar feared that Hondo would make landfall in the country after being struck by Cyclone Ivan on February16. However, the storm turn towards the southwest, away from Madagascar. On February23 ex-Hondo tracked just offshore Mauritius before passing directly over Réunion, just short of moderate tropical storm status. Sustained winds of 50km/h (31mph) with gusts up to 76km/h (47mph) were recorded on Mauritius while sustained winds of 55km/h (35mph) with gusts up to 99km/h (61mph) were recorded on Réunion. The highest rainfall total was recorded at Takamaka, totaling to 750mm (29.5in). Up to 760,000 people were affected on Réunion and overall damage was minimal.|$|E

25|$|Divisions {{organised}} attacks {{according to}} SS 135 (Instructions {{for the training}} of Platoons for Offensive Action) of December 1916. The pamphlet {{was derived from the}} experience of the Somme in 1916 for divisions to organise according to a common pattern and prescribed the siege warfare methods necessary for trench-to-trench attacks, the semi-open fighting, when defensive positions had been captured and open warfare techniques, for when the defence collapsed. All the sections of SS 135 addressed the problem of command when no voice communication existed by prescribing that a commander's intention must be communicated and that the infantry should make every effort to send back information by any means available, primarily by visual methods which needed specialist parties to advance with the infantry to set up relay stations, carrier pigeons, experimental wireless sets, power buzzers, signal lamps and runners, who were trained to use the terrain <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> trench systems for maximum protection.|$|E

500|$|Von Neumann's {{closest friend}} in the United States was {{mathematician}} Stanislaw Ulam. A later friend of Ulam's, Gian-Carlo Rota, wrote: [...] "They would spend hours on end gossiping and giggling, swapping Jewish jokes, and drifting {{in and out of}} mathematical talk." [...] When von Neumann was dying in hospital, every time Ulam would visit he would come prepared with a new collection of jokes to cheer up his friend. He believed that much of his mathematical thought occurred intuitively, and he would often go to sleep with a problem unsolved, <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> answer immediately upon waking up. Ulam noted that von Neumann's way of thinking might not be visual, but more of an aural one.|$|E
500|$|According to {{theological}} {{author and}} editor Robert Van De Weyer, this asserts that all {{love is a}} reflection of one's own soul: parents' love of their children, a love of religion or of the entire world. German Indologist and Oxford University professor Max Müller says that the love described in the Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad extends to all aspects of one's life and beyond; in verse 2.4.5, [...] "The Devas (gods) are not dear to one out of love for gods, but because one may love the Self (Atman) that the gods are dear". In the dialogue [...] "the Brahman-class, the Kshatra-class, these worlds, these gods, these beings, everything that is what this Soul is", and when [...] "we see, hear, perceive <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> Self, then all is known".|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team decided that, as with And Then There Were None, {{they would}} change Christie's original ending for Murder on the Orient Express. The {{aim of the}} developers was to create games that would not only appeal to casual gamers, but also to Christie fans. As nearly all Christie fans have read Murder on the Orient Express, <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> solution, and considering that the novel was to be included with the game, the developers decided that the ending needed to be changed. The novel has two solutions [...] one being {{what appears to be}} happening and the other being what is actually occurring [...] and the developers aimed to develop a third solution which drew on these two solutions and still surprised the player. Lee Sheldon admitted that his variation to the ending of And Then There Were None received some criticism, and said that in Murder on the Orient Express changing the ending was even harder because of the sheer fame of the book and its solution. He also expressed his hatred of adaptations of older material which make fun of that time period, and said {{that he was trying to}} stay as faithful to Christie's work and time era as possible.|$|E

Each year, the city hosts a parade downtown, which is preceded by the dyeing of the Chicago River.

2500|$|Some {{instructors}} for Japanese as {{a foreign}} language [...] "introduce katakana after the students have learned {{to read and write}} sentences in hiragana without difficulty <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> rules." [...] Most students who have learned hiragana [...] "do not have great difficulty in memorizing" [...] katakana as well. Other instructors introduce the katakana first, because these are used with loanwords. This gives students a chance to practice reading and writing kana with meaningful words. This was the approach taken by the influential American linguistics scholar Eleanor Harz Jorden in [...] (parallel to [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on National Public Radio (NPR), author Michael Lind said, [...] "Before {{the rise of a}} self-conscious intelligentsia, most educated people [...] as well as the unlettered majority [...] spent most of their time in the countryside or, if they lived in cities, were a few blocks away from farmland or wilderness... At the risk of sounding countercultural, I suspect that thinkers who live in sealed, air-conditioned boxes and work by artificial light (I am one) are as unnatural as apes in cages at zoos. Naturalists like Eiseley in that sense are the most normal human beings to be found among intellectuals, because they {{spend a lot of time}} outdoors <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> names of the plants and animals they see...

This museum was designed to allow tourists and local visitors to really get to understand <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> city of Galway. This museum also houses the statue of the poet, Pádraic Ó Conaire which was originally located in the Kennedy Park section of Eyre Square, prior to the Square's renovation.

DHS also assumes that people {{have at least a}} basic understanding of how computers communicate <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> limits of their privacy rights when they choose to access federal networks. The Privacy Act of 1974 does not apply to Einstein 2 data because its system of records generally do not contain personal information and so are not indexed or queried by the names of individual persons.

2500|$|In 1880, {{the site}} of the Le Rosey campus was chosen by the school's founder, Paul-Emile Carnal, [...] "a lover of nature, history and the countryside". The Le Rosey campus at Rolle is {{situated}} adjacent to the famous Lake Geneva. In 1911, the founder passed the ownership of Le Rosey to his son, Henri-Paul Carnal. In 1917, the school began to go to Gstaad in the German-speaking Canton of Berne for the winter months to escape the dense fog that settles in on Lake Geneva. In 1947, the third generation of directors, Louis Johannot and Helen Schaub, assumed ownership of Le Rosey. Under the same ownership, in 1967, Le Rosey admitted girls {{for the first time and}} opened a separate girls' campus. In 1980, the current owners, Philippe and Anne Gudin de la Sablonnière, became the fourth generation of Directors at Le Rosey. Louis Johannot, in an interview with Life Magazine in 1965, made a comment that received considerable attention: [...] "The only reason I always try to meet <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> parents better is because it helps me to forgive their children." ...|$|E

[...] He is given special powers but uses them to the almost detriment of the United States because he did not study <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> difference between his own side and the enemy. [...] At the conclusion of the film, he recognizes the need for an education. [...] The appropriately titled film Booby Traps uses Private Snafu to show the dangers and the caution needed to be taken in the case of such malicious devices. Spies once again portrays Private Snafu acting counter to what he has been told. [...] The intoxicated G.I. gives secrets to a beautiful woman who is really a Nazi spy.
