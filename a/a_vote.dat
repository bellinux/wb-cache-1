5|$|Because of {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} state, {{the constitution of}} 1816 began to be criticized. Opponents claimed the constitution had too many appointed positions, the terms established were inadequate, {{and some of the}} clauses were too easily manipulated by the political parties that did not exist when then constitution was written. The first constitution had not been put to <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> by the general public, and following the great population growth in the state, it was seen as inadequate. A constitutional convention was called in January 1851 to create a new one. The new constitution was approved by the convention on February 10, 1851, and submitted for <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> to the electorate that year. It was approved and has since been the official constitution.|$|E

5|$|Democrats in the General Assembly were outraged. When the 1930 {{legislative}} session convened, they immediately {{passed a bill}} that stripped Sampson of his power to appoint a highway commissioner, giving it to a three-person commission composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. The Republican Sampson would be outnumbered and outvoted in this group. Confident that the Democrats would not lose another gubernatorial election, Democratic legislators stipulated in the bill that the appointment power {{would return to the}} governor in 1931, the end of Sampson's term. The law passed the House by <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> of 53—42 and the Senate by <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> of 22—15. Sampson vetoed the bill, but the veto was overridden, and Johnson was returned to his former position.|$|E

40|$|Analyses using {{national}} {{aggregate data}} indicate that in the Japanese national elections, <b>a</b> personal <b>vote</b> produces <b>a</b> consistency <b>vote,</b> while <b>a</b> party <b>vote</b> produces <b>a</b> swing <b>vote.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze through survey research whether <b>a</b> personal <b>vote</b> produces <b>a</b> consistency or swing vote. The first hypothesis in this paper is that a positive candidate factor for the LDP candidate can prevent those who voted for the LDP in the previous election from swinging their votes. The second hypothesis is that a positive candidate factor for the LDP candidate can change non-LDP voters in the previous election into LDP voters. The data was gathered from voters living in Kanazawa city, Ishikawa prefecture. The analysis confirmed the first hypothesis as valid, showing that <b>a</b> personal <b>vote</b> produces <b>a</b> consistency <b>vote.</b> The second hypothesis is also valid; however, <b>a</b> personal <b>vote</b> produces <b>a</b> consistency rather than swing vote. Therefore, this research has shown that <b>a</b> personal <b>vote</b> produces <b>a</b> consistency <b>vote</b> even in <b>an</b> analysis based on survey research...|$|R
