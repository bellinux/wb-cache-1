From {{his very first}} discourse onwards, the Buddha explains the reality of things in terms of cause and effect. The existence of misery and suffering in any given individual {{is due to the}} presence of causes. One way to describe the Buddhist eightfold path is a turning towards the reality of things as they <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> and understanding reality directly, although it is debated the degree to which these investigations are metaphysical or epistemological.|$|E

2500|$|Leader of the Opposition and NDP leader Thomas Mulcair said [...] that [...] "Chris Alexander {{has a lot}} {{to answer}} for, but that’s not where we <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> We’re worried about how we got here, how the {{collective}} international response has been so defective, how Canada has failed so completely." [...] NDP MP Fin Donnelly was accused of using the tragic event as a means to garner votes, because he initially told reporters that he had personally handed a letter to Immigration Minister Chris Alexander urging the minister to look at the refugee application of Alan Kurdi's family, but that Canadian immigration authorities denied the family's application. However, later the aunt of Alan Kurdi revealed that the application was made only for Kurdi's uncle and was rejected because it was not complete. Meanwhile, the Citizenship and Immigration Canada office clarified that they had not received the proper documentation to certify refugee status for the uncle's family. Mulcair later defended Donnelly, saying that no apology was warranted because the letter had mentioned both families, and stated that he [...] "couldn’t be prouder to have someone of the strength, integrity and hard work as Fin Donnelly" [...] in caucus.|$|E

60|$|A {{person who}} is ignorant of legal matters is always liable to make {{mistakes}} {{when he tries to}} photograph a court scene with his pen; and so I was not willing to let the law chapters in this book go to press without first subjecting them to rigid and exhausting revision and correction by a trained barrister--if that is what they are called. These chapters <b>are</b> <b>right,</b> <b>now,</b> in every detail, for they were rewritten under the immediate eye of William Hicks, who studied law part of a while in southwest Missouri thirty-five years ago and then came over here to Florence for his health and is still helping for exercise and board in Macaroni Vermicelli's horse-feed shed, which is up the back alley as you turn around the corner out of the Piazza del Duomo just beyond the house where that stone that Dante used to sit on six hundred years ago is let into the wall when he let on to be watching them build Giotto's campanile and yet always got tired looking as Beatrice passed along on her way to get a chunk of chestnut cake to defend herself with in case of a Ghibelline outbreak before she got to school, at the same old stand where they sell the same old cake to this day and it is just as light and good as it was then, too, and this is not flattery, far from it. He was a little rusty on his law, but he rubbed up for this book, and those two or three legal chapters are right and straight, now. He told me so himself.|$|E
