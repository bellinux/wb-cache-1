We have developed a mouse model of closed-head blast injury using an air pressure wave delivered to a small area {{on one side of}} the cranium, which we have used to create mild TBI. We found that 20 -psi blasts in 3 -month old C 57 BL/ 6 male mice yielded no obvious behavioral or histological evidence of brain injury, while 25 - 40 psi blasts produced transient anxiety in an open field arena but little histological evidence of brain damage. By contrast, 50 - 60 psi blasts resulted in anxiety-like behavior in an open field arena that became more evident with time after blast. In additional behavioral tests conducted 2 - 8 weeks after blast, 50 - 60 psi mice also demonstrated increased acoustic startle, perseverance of learned fear, and enhanced contextual fear, as well as depression-like behavior and diminished prepulse inhibition. We found no evident cerebral pathology, however, and only scattered axonal degeneration in brain sections from 50 - 60 psi mice 3 - 8 weeks after blast. Thus, the TBI caused by single 50 - 60 psi blasts in mice exhibits the minimal neuronal loss coupled to diffuse axonal injury characteristic of human mild TBI. A reduction in the abundance of a subpopulation of excitatory projection neurons in basolateral amygdala enriched in Thy 1 was, however, observed. The reported link of this neuronal population to fear suppression suggests their damage by mild TBI may contribute to the heightened anxiety and fearfulness observed after blast in our mice.

Furthermore, the most influential parameters on AOp, including the maximum charge per delay and the distance between the blast-face and monitoring point, were measured and used to train the ICA-ANN model. Based on the generalized predictor equation and considering the measured data from the granite quarry site, a new empirical equation was developed to predict AOp.

When dome is supported by columns, no overpressure is required inside the dome which is important when the dome covers a damaged nuclear reactor. The nuclear reactor may produce radioactive gases and dust, and, as inflatable domes are not typically hermetically sealed, the increased pressure inside the dome can leak out gas and dust into the atmosphere.

This paper presents the development of two artificial intelligence techniques, namely artificial neural network (ANN) and ANN based on genetic algorithm (GA) for prediction of AOp. For this purpose, a database was compiled from 97 blasting events in a granite quarry in Penang, Malaysia. The values of maximum charge per delay and the distance from the blast-face were set as model inputs to predict AOp. To verify the quality and reliability of the ANN and GA-ANN models, several statistical functions, i. e., root means square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R 2) and variance account for (VAF) were calculated. Based on the obtained results, the GA-ANN model is found to be better than ANN model in estimating AOp induced by blasting.

40|$|Abstract The {{economics}} of a mining operation is directly influenced by blasting outcomes, where blasting aims to comminute the rock mass {{in order to}} attain smaller grain sizes to be loaded and hauled at a minimum cost for its first processing stage. In order to promote adequate rock breakage, the stemming structure needs to provide proper confinement for the borehole charged with explosives, reflecting the energy released during the detonation in form of shock waves and gases to act throughout the in situ rock mass, enlarging its failures and fractures, and also creating new ones. To build up a stemming column, literature recommends the usage of dry granular materials instead of elements with plastic behavior. However, a study was performed using Gypsum plaster as stemming; a kind of material that exhibits solid-like behavior when it is dry. Following this theory, this test verified improvements regarding confinement effectiveness and energy propagation throughout the rock mass when a non-Newtonian mixture (NNM) was applied as stemming; a material that shows a solid-like behavior when is under shear stress. When the stemming arrangement was composed of NNM, {{it was able to}} reduce energy and gas losses to the atmosphere, because of the liquid's property of filling voids into the borehole. The NNM yielded high results due to its better confinement effectiveness, a reduction of <b>air</b> <b>overpressure,</b> and an increase of the strain propagation and ground vibration throughout the rock...|$|E

ISO 31010 has been recently issued which provides a structured process that identifies how objectives may be affected, and analyses the risk in term of consequences and their probabilities before deciding on whether further treatment is required. In this lecture, that ISO Standard has been adapted to Open Pit Blasting Operations, focusing in Environmental effects which can be managed properly. Technique used is Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), which is applied in all possible scenarios, providing to Blasting Professionals the tools to identify, analyze and manage environmental effects in blasting operations.

40|$|Vocal {{communication}} {{is a crucial}} aspect of animal behavior. The mechanism which most mammals use to vocalize relies on three anatomical components. First, <b>air</b> <b>overpressure</b> is generated inside the lower vocal tract. Second, as the airstream goes through the glottis, sound is produced via vocal fold vibration. Third, this sound is further filtered by the geometry and length of the upper vocal tract. Evidence from mammalian anatomy and bioacoustics suggests {{that some of these}} three components may covary with an animal’s body size. The framework provided by acoustic allometry suggests that, because vocal tract length (VTL) is more strongly constrained by the growth of the body than vocal fold length (VFL), VTL generates more reliable acoustic cues to an animal’s size. This hypothesis is often tested acoustically but rarely anatomically, especially in pinnipeds. Here, we test the anatomical bases of the acoustic allometry hypothesis in harbor seal pups Phoca vitulina. We dissected and measured vocal tract, vocal folds, and other anatomical features of 15 harbor seals post-mortem. We found that, while VTL correlates with body size, VFL does not. This suggests that, while body growth puts anatomical constraints on how vocalizations are filtered by harbor seals’ vocal tract, no such constraints appear to exist on vocal folds, at least during puppyhood. It is particularly interesting to find anatomical constraints on harbor seals’ vocal tracts, the same anatomical region partially enabling pups to produce individually distinctive vocalizations...|$|E
40|$|The author, in {{a series}} of {{previous}} articles, designed the “AB Dome” made of transparent thin film supported by a small additional <b>air</b> <b>overpressure</b> for the purpose of covering a city or other important large installations or sub-regions. In present article the author offers a variation in which a damaged nuclear station can be quickly covered by such a cheap inflatable dome. By containing the radioactive dust from the damaged nuclear station, the danger zone is reduced to about 2 km 2 rather than large regions which requires the resettlement of huge masses of people and which stops indus-try in large areas. If there is a big city (as Tokyo) near the nuclear disaster or there is already a dangerous amount of radioactive dust near a city, the city may also be covered by a large inflatable transparent Dome. The building of a gi-gantic inflatable AB Dome over an empty flat surface is not difficult. The cover is spread on a flat surface and a venti-lator (fan system) pumps air under the film cover and lifts the new dome into place but inflation takes many hours. However, to cover a city, garden, forest or other obstacle course in contrast to an empty, mowed field, the thin film cannot be easily deployed over building or trees without risking damage to it by snagging and other complications. This article proposes a new method which solves this problem. The design is a double film blanket filled by light gas such as, methane, hydrogen, or helium - although of these, methane will be the most practical and least likely to leak.

Para esta temperatura o vapor puro apresentou uma excelente distribuicão de calor com diferenças de temperatura não maiores que 0, 6 º C cumprindo com o sugerido pela Food and Drug Administration", seguido por mistura com 90 % de vapor, água com sobrepressão a 126 kPa, água com sobrepressão a 191 kPa e mistura com 70 % de vapor. Esta mistura vapor/ar, foi descartada por não ter atingido estabilidade durante o "tempo de processo", com diferenças de temperaturas de até 2 º C e ocorrência de pontos frios na metade superior do conjunto de prateleiras. A seleção dos meios de aquecimento Foi completada com ensaios de penetracão de calor a 121 º C em blocos simuladores. A penetração de calor dos blocos, em água com sobrapressão a 126 ou 191 kPa foi muito lenta, decorrente do longo tempo de subida. Isto impossibilitou o cálculo das taxas e fatores de atraso do aquecimento (fh e jh, respectivamente). Consequentemente, este meio de aquecimento foi descartado para o estudo da penetração de calor em bolsas no sistema modificado. Não foram detectadas diferenças significativas (&# 945;= 0, 005) nos "fh", "jh", "fc" ou jc, de blocos instalados sobre as prateleiras 2 ou 6 processados em vapor puro ou mistura com 90 % de vapor. Consequentemente, a mistura com 90 % de vapor foi selecionada como o melhor meio de aquecimento para os experimentos com bolsas esterilizáveis. Bolsas contendo 160 g de suspensão aquosa de bentonita 10 % (p/p) e de 1 a 33 mL de ar residual foram esterilizados 15 mín. A 121 ° C em mistura com 90 % de vapor na autoclave modificada. As soldas de fundo e lateral cumpriram com as sugestões s da Food and Drug Administration" referentes à integridade, podendo ser consideradas como de "Alto Desempenho". As bolsas com i a 11 mL de ar residual apresentaram as seguintes características melhor aspecto visual, aquecimento e resfriamento mais rápidos com os menores "fh" e "fc" e o máximo valor de Fo". Porém, quando comparadas com as bolsas contendo de 12 a 33 mL de ar residual estas diferenças não foram significativas (&# 945;= 0, 005). A Dixie vertical retort (pilot size, 300 L) {{was modified}} for retort pouch sterilization. The modification involved {{the installation of}} a line to inject air into the steam inlet Pipe, {{the construction of a}} rack with 10 trays confining up to 30 pouches with 110 x 150 mm (internal dimensions) and allowing up to 20 mm of thickness, the installation of a glass sight tube and one stell pipe for venting. Blocks of nylon- 6 with 15 x 110 x 150 mm were constructed simulating retort pouches containing foods. Heating media for retort pouches were selected through heat distribution tests at 105, 113 and 121 º C in a full retort with 30 simulative blocks heated in the following media. pure steam (as pattern), steam/air mixtures with 70 e 90 % steam and water heated by steam with <b>air</b> <b>overpressure</b> at the same level as steam/air mixtures. Temperature of 121 º C allowed the most stable control with the best heat distributions. For this temperature pure steam showed an excellent heat distribution with temperature differences no higher than 0. 6 ° C in agreement with the suggestion of Food and Drug Administration, followed by mixture with 90 % steam, water with overpressure at 126 kPa, water with overpressure at 191 kPa and mixture with 70 % steam. This mixture was discarded because it did not achieve stabilization during "processing time", with differences up to 2 º C and cold points in the upper half of the rack. Heating media selection was completed with heat penetration tests at 121 º C with simulating blocks. Heat penetration m water at 126 and 191 kPa were very slow because of the long come up time, that did not allow the calculation of heating rates and lag factors (fh and jh respectively). Therefore, water was discarded for further heat penetration tests in retort pouches in thy modified retort. No significant differences (&# 945;= 0, 005) among "fh", "jh", "fc" ou "jc" parameters were detected for simulative blocks processed in pure steam or mixture with 90 % steam on tray 2 or 6. Therefore mixtures with 90 % steam were selected as the best heating media for the experiments in retort pouches. Pouches containing 160 g of bentonite 10 % (w/w) in water and 1 to 33 mL of residual sir were sterilized 15 min at 121 º C in mixture with 90 % steam m the modified retort. Lateral and bottom seals have attained the recommendation for integrity of the Food and Drug Administration end can be considered as "High Performance" seals. Pouches with 1 to 11 mL of residual air showed the best visual appearance, the fastest heating and cooling with the lower "fh" e "fc" and highest "Fo" value, but if compared against packages with 12 a 33 mL of residual air, these differences were not significatives (&# 945;= 0, 005) ...|$|E
