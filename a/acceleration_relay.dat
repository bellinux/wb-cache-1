In case of automatic starting controller's shaft is turned to a next position, and the current in electric engine is brought down to 170 to 180 amperes. The starting with less transfer currents is possible for a next position 125 A. For this purpose, an engineer must push [...] "Decreased Acceleration Button".

40|$|<b>Acceleration</b> using {{centrifugal}} <b>relays</b> is {{a recently}} discovered method for {{the acceleration of}} spaceborne payloads to high velocity at high thrust. Centrifugal relays are moving rotors which progressively accelerate reaction mass to higher velocities. One important engineering problem consists of accurately tracking {{the position of the}} projectiles and rotors and guiding each projectile exactly onto the appropriate guide tracks on each rotor. The topics of this research are the system kinematics and dynamics and the computerized guidance system which will allow the projectile to approach each rotor with exact timing with respect to the rotor rotation period and with very small errors in lateral positions. Kinematics studies include analysis of rotor and projectile positions versus time and projectile/rotor interactions. Guidance studies include {{a detailed description of the}} tracking mechanism (interrupt of optical beams) and the aiming mechanism (electromagnetic focusing) including the design of electromagnetic deflection coils and the switching circuitry...|$|R
40|$|The GE N 60 relay {{evaluation}} {{project was}} conducted by Brenna Andrews with help from Richard Setterstrom and Daniel Kachmarik from NorthWestern Energy. The goal {{of the project was}} to determine if the GE N 60 relay was a sufficient replacement candidate for the <b>Acceleration</b> Trend <b>Relays</b> (ATRs) currently being utilized on four stem-coal generators in Colstrip, Montana, to protect the power system. The ATRs protect the power system from events such as faults or equipment damage. The criteria used to evaluate the GE N 60 relayâ€™s capabilities included the following: The GE N 60 relay must have a sampling frequency equal to or greater than that of the ATRs. The GE N 60 relay must have minimal noise so as not to affect trip decisions in the relay. The GE N 60 relay must be able to accurately detect events. The GE N 60 relay must be able to create and store event records of adequate length. The GE N 60 relay was programmed to emulate the functions of the ATRs. Two Colstrip-Broadview transmission-line events were captured simultaneously by the ATRs and the GE N 60 relay. Comparison of the speed deviation, acceleration, and power responses from these two events showed that the GE N 60 relay is an adequate replacement candidate for the GE N 60 relay. Refer to Figures 27 through 40. The GE N 60 relay proved to have a variable sampling frequency. The relay determined events based on the frequency deviation and frequency rate of change threshold values. The frequency deviation value was sampled at 60 Hz in the GE N 60 relay, whereas the ATRs could sample at 150 Hz. The decision was made that, until further testing could be completed, the lower frequency deviation sampling rate would not make the collected data unusable. From qualitative analysis, the noise level was proved to be acceptable, since the GE N 60 relay trip decisions were not affected by what noise was present in the event responses. The decision was made that additional filtering could be implemented so long as the trip decision speed is not compromised. Finally, the GE N 60 relay proved to accurately detect and store events. The GE N 60 relay was able to detect events simultaneously with the ATRs, showing that the ATR functions were correctly emulated in the GE N 60 relay. The GE N 60 relay event records were of acceptable length and exceptional quality. Based on these results, the GE N 60 relay was found to be an adequate replacement candidate for the ATRs in Colstrip and should {{move on to the next}} stages of testing...|$|R
40|$|Boxing {{has seen}} limited advancements {{in way of}} {{quantification}} of the sport during live professional fights. The PunchR system is an automated measurement system to collect information about a fight in realtime with fine-grained temporal resolution. The system employs nonintrusive accelerometers placed on the insides of boxers' wrists beneath their gloves to wirelessly <b>relay</b> <b>acceleration</b> data to a ringside laptop. Statistical models process the data for realtime estimates of fight metrics to quantify the action {{taking place in the}} ring including punch count, punch speed, punch force, and punch type. There are no new risks provided to the boxers during the fight nor do these accelerometers affect either of the boxers' physical performances. The statistical methods used to construct these statistical models are non-parametric in a sense that the data is really driving the modeling procedure without any notion of a structure prior to model construction. Data for the models is collected in a controlled experimental boxing setting or through video review of live fights. Model features are derived from the acceleration profiles of punches combined with boxer physical measurements to create a complete feature set to train the models. Primarily, the boxing metrics are largely tangible quantities that already are commonplace in boxing discussions (count, speed, force, and type) but have no prior method of measure. Methods are also developed to measure number of counterpunches and flurries using the timing of certain punches. Newly proposed metrics not in typical boxing terminology are either combinations of the common punch metrics or other measures taken from the acceleration data. These metrics attempt to measure a boxer's aggression and different measures of overall punch quality. The groundwork for these new contributions to boxing metrics and resulting visualizations for these metrics arise through the study of 65 professional boxing matches. Two complete fight summaries illustrate how a fight narrative can be told through use of the new metrics and visualizations. The PunchR system has been developed to begin the higher level quantification of boxing...|$|R
