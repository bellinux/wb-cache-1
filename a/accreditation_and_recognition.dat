After narrow consultation the level descriptors were discussed and accepted. As all proposals this will still be open for changes. The following roles were described using the format of a Qualification based on Unit Standards. Unit Standards are linked to the proposed six "roles" which are seen as generic to all Pastoral Counselling practices: Maintain effective relational and communication competence, Apply and maintain professional work ethics, Plan and facilitate pastoral counselling process, Engage in an effective personal development process, Design and conduct course of treatment, Conduct research, The roles and applied competencies for the pastoral counselling/therapy specialised field were defined. These roles may be used to re-shape current qualifications, as well as to research and design new qualifications. They are intended as initial guidelines for providers.

40|$|Dental {{practice}} and education {{are becoming more}} globalized. Greater practitioner and patient mobility, {{the free flow of}} information, increasingly global standards of care and new legal and economic frameworks (such as European Union [EU] legislation) are forcing a review of dental licensure, specialization and continuing education systems. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare these systems in Canada, France, Germany, the UK and the US. Representatives from the five countries completed a 29 -item questionnaire, and the information was collated and summarized qualitatively. Statutory bodies are responsible for licensing and re-licensing in all countries. In the two North American countries, this responsibility rests with individual states, and in Europe, with the countries themselves, mainly governed by the legal framework of the EU. In some countries, re-licensure requires completion of continuing education credits. Approaches to dental specialization tend to differ widely with regard to definition of specialities, course and duration of training, training facilities, and accreditation of training programmes. In most countries, continuing education is provided by a number of different entities, such as universities, dental associations, companies, institutes and private individuals. <b>Accreditation</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> of continuing education is primarily process-driven, not outcome-orientated.

40|$|M. Ed. South Africa {{needs to}} spread its {{available}} and required competence, skills and educational basis among its broad population (Valchanges, 1992 : 23). This {{is reflected in}} South Africa being rated 43 rd out of 47 countries in the human development and skills level, or put differently, 14 th out of 15 Group II countries in the World Competitiveness Report of 1992 (Gerber, Nel and Van Dyk, 1995 : 6). The South African educational system also ranked 14 th of the 15 Group II countries in the same report (Gerber, et al, 1995 : 7). The situation is even worse if the World Competitiveness Report of 1995 is taken into consideration. South Africa ranked. 44 th of 46 countries regarding its human resource development (Buffington and Associates, 1996; Rossouw, 1996 : 3; Pretoria News, 29 May 1996). If the above is taken into consideration {{it is clear that}} the start of the National Training Board (NTB) process that began in 1993 was necessary. The initial debates in the process were located within the vocational training context (HSRC, 1995 : 34). Four stakeholders entered the initial NTB process; namely: The government of the day with official representation by the departments of Education and Labour (called the Department of Manpower at the time); Representatives of different employers organisations; Representatives of organised labour; and Providers of learning. Different concerns from each of the above stakeholders caused a shift in the debate from a concern about vocational training to a broader concept of vocational education and training. This lead to the argument of an integrated approach. Thus: The field of education, training and development should adopt an integrated approach to all activities and systems currently classified as education and training and, unlike the past concentrate on vocational training only (HSRC, 1995 : 35). As part of such an integrated approach, education, training and development should not be seen as separate entities, but as one unit within the larger field of human resource development, i. e. the development of all those involved in Education, Training and Development (ETD), must be ranked as one of the biggest priorities in South Africa (National Training Board, 1995 a: 5). In November 1993, Working Committee 3 of the NTB submitted a report on "Trainer Development", under the title of "Education, Training and Development Practitioner" (NTB Annexure A, 1995 c: 2) thus starting a process of integrating the ETD field. Those involved in ETD were referred to as Education, Training and Development Practitioners (ETDP). The original task given to Working Committee 3 reads as follows: "Develop a South African competency-based model for trainers. Identify requirements for registration, certification, <b>accreditation</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> of existing qualifications and experience or competency in a national integrated certification/qualification structure. " The ETDP competency model must be based on outcomes/outputs as a central focus, that will link the ETDP competency model with the National Qualifications Framework (NQF), thus ensuring registration, certification, <b>accreditation</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> of existing qualifications and experience (NTB, 1995 c: 21.

The study was undertaken during the period April-December 2000 by research staff from the Institute of Public Administration. Drawing upon previous research, this current study focuses on the critically important issues of <b>accreditation</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition.</b> In particular, by critically evaluating current arrangements, and drawing upon best practice here and elsewhere, this study provides objective and practical suggestions as to how best to introduce a QCS Mark in the Irish public service. This study was also undertaken in consultation with the QCS Working Group which has a vital role to play in taking forward the current QCS Initiative in the civil and wider public service. Why research a possible QCS Mark for the Irish public service? At the planning stage of the research, initial consultations indicated that: · There is considerable support for the view that the development of an effective servicewide system of <b>accreditation</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> (i. e. a QCS Mark) could have a key role to play in the next phase of the QCS Initiative. · A well-designed QCS Mark scheme could assist the internal and external promotion of a quality customer service, by raising awareness and morale, and acting as a driver for progressive change. · Such a development could also have major implications for the promotion of a benchmarking approach to QCS by the public service. · It could provide a platform to facilitate the sharing of best practice among organisations, promote healthy competition and allow achievement to be acknowledged. · An appropriate and effective QCS Mark scheme could also facilitate improved service delivery integration within and between public bodies. Scope of the research Accordingly, this study seeks to: · review current quality accreditation systems in Ireland and elsewhere. This will help identify the range of approaches available, potential key elements and appropriate concepts for an Irish public service QCS Mark system · identify (a) the potential benefits and other implications for the Irish public service from the introduction of a voluntary and attainable QCS Mark system and (b) the key issues to be addressed in order to introduce system-wide accreditation · outline a framework for QCS accreditation in the Irish public service and how such a system might be administered and resourced · make recommendations on the steps to be taken to introduce the proposed system,in the civil service in the first instance, with a view to its extension to the wider public service. Our research presents: · a detailed review and evaluation of relevant QCS and quality management literature.

However, <b>accreditation</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> of that role has been devolved to the autonomic regions. The opinions of the RT may be relevant to future decisions; Methods A comprehensive questionnaire, including demographic characteristics, academic and research achievement and personal views about their role, was sent to 201 RTs in the Murcia Region of Spain. The responses are described using median and interquartile ranges (IQR); Results There were 147 replies (response rate 73 %), 69 % male, mean age 45 ± 7 yrs. RTs perception of the residents' initial knowledge and commitment throughout the program was 5 (IQR 4 - 6) and 7 (IQR 5 - 8), respectively. As regards {{their impact on the}} PMT program, RTs considered that their own contribution was similar to that of senior residents. RTs perception of how their role was recognised was 5 (IQR 3 - 6). Only 16 % did not encounter difficulties in accessing specific RT training programs. Regarding the RTs view of their various duties, supervision of patient care was accorded the greatest importance (64 %) while the satisfactory completion of the PMT program and supervision of day-to-day activities were also considered important (61 % and 59 % respectively). The main RT requirements were: a greater professional recognition (97 %), protected time (95 %), specific RT training programs (95 %) and financial recognition (86 %); Conclusions This comprehensive study, reflecting the feelings of our RTs, provides a useful insight into the reality of their work and the findings ought to be taken into consideration in the imminent definitive regulatory document on PMT. </p...|$|E

40|$|While {{nutrition}} information {{is readily available}} and the basic advice is reasonably clear, the science of nutrition is actually quite complex and sometimes more is needed than just the basic information. The earlier chapters of this book demonstrate the breadth of knowledge in nutrition. Many years of education are required {{to do justice to}} all these areas, but there comes a point where students of nutrition can be of value in translating nutrition knowledge for others and working with various groups in applying nutrition knowledge and skills to help solve problems and contribute to innovation. Providing expert advice and engaging in activities that draw on knowledge and skills depends on the context. In the case of healthcare services, <b>accreditation</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> of particular skills training in the healthcare context is required. In research, public health programs and policy development, and food innovation and marketing there is greater variation of the requirements for nutrition, depending on the task at hand. Even so, formal recognised training and experience are important elements in determining who is best to do the job. Governments play a large role in the public health arena. Given the fundamental nature of the relationship between food and health, governments drive policies, programs and activities that are strongly linked to food and nutrition. There is a very wide array of locations in which nutrition practitioners can contribute, and in which they are required to ensure a nutrition science base to these activities. Many of these practitioners will also be engaged in research, either entirely as researchers or in a focused way with other responsibilities. There is a strong interdependence between nutrition research and practice, as they both inform each other. Practice is dependent on scientific evidence and research is dependent on questions derived from practice. Problems arise when the methodologies of research do not adequately address the needs of practice, that is, the path to translation is difficult. Thus collaboration and cooperation are important in all the research and practice areas of nutrition. Collaboration is particularly important in the food industry domain. From the perspective of the whole value chain of food production, nutrition applications in the food industry range from research and food innovation through to marketing and communications and regulatory affairs. There are many opportunities for students,hained in nutrition to contribute to organisations associated with food and nutrition. This chapter explores the dimensions of nutrition practice in these main locations...|$|E
