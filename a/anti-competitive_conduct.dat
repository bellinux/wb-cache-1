40|$|Before {{the current}} {{financial}} crisis, economic recessions in history were always accompanied by relaxation or abandon of competition policy. However, {{in the current}} financial crisis, although different jurisdictions have different practices, most jurisdictions have kept {{the bottom line of}} competition policy enforcement.

Chinais one of the few countries still weakening competition policy enforcement during the current financial crisis. In fact, there are several mechanisms contained in competition laws and policies, such as the exemption of cartels, the defense of business concentrations and the coordination between competition authorities and sector regulators, which provide some space of flexible competition policy enforcement during economic recessions.

40|$|A new PRC Anti-Monopoly Law (AML) {{was enacted}} on August 30, 2007 and took effect on August 1, 2008. The new AML is a {{milestone}} in Chinese economic policy. It will reorganise the competition paradigm in many Chinese domestic sectors. PRC's telecommunications sector had undergone {{a number of major}} reforms in the past two decades. These reforms include one fundamental regulatory restructuring and three significant market reorganisations. As a result, the PRC telecommunications industry has developed by an astonishingly fast speed. In May 2008, the PRC State Council initiated a large telecommunications reform in both regulatory domain and market restructure. This reform has created a mega-telecommunications regulator, and merged six telecommunications players into three giant operators. All these were done 3 months prior to the country's AML become effective. Against this background, this paper studies the new AML and its various provisions in relation to antimonopoly and <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conducts</b> and attempts to validate those provisions against the recent PRC telecommunications reform. Part 1 provides an introduction of the telecommunications industry in China, including its regulatory framework and its market arrangement. Part 2 studies the 13 -year long law making history of the new AML and highlights some of the major aspects of this act. Part 3 analyses the recent telecommunications reform in China. Part 4 analyses the interplay between the AML and the recent telecommunications reform. In conclusion, the paper argues that the recent telecommunications reform constitutes an administrative monopolistic conduct in the telecommunications market, which clearly breached provisions set in chapter 5 of the AML. As a result, the AML is unlikely to effectively foster competition in China's telecom industry. Moreover, if this situation is not addressed by the PRC government in a timely manner, it would undermine the sustainability of the telecommunications industry and challenge the effectiveness of the AML.

40|$|KT, {{the major}} telecom service {{provider}} in Korea, {{was transformed into}} a purely private company in August 2002, in accordance with the complete divestiture of government's shares. Thereafter, KT has been entitled to manage its businesses with full degree of freedom with no government intervention or influence as long as its <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conducts</b> are not concerned. However, {{it is worth noting that}} KT's procurement in fact is still being bound by bilateral and multilateral Government Procurement Agreements(GPAs) which legally cover government or public entities only. This paper, motivated by the contradictory state of affairs, seeks to evaluate and get some lessons from the Korean government's negotiation strategies through scrutinizing its former GPAs negotiations in telecom sector and as well its recent follow-up negotiations for the exclusion of KT from them. Based upon the findings of this paper, the Korean government is generally responsible for the delay of follow-up negotiations from the perspectives as follows: first, it accepted 'Agreement' as a legal formality in the past, which is hard to modify in accordance with the change of procurement market environment; second, existing bilateral and multilateral GPAs lack the criteria for the exclusion of committed entities, while there was no such efforts made to arrange those in GPAs after taking effect; third, it lost appropriate timing to launch follow-up negotiations to exclude KT from GPAs; and finally, it lingered around in preparing negotiation leverages to turn the tables in the follow-up negotiations even after the complete privatization of KT. In this context, we could regard it as an effective and irreversible action for marking a new phase that the Korean government revised the domestic regulation affecting KT's procurement of telecom equipments around the end of 2003. What is important for the future bilateral negotiations is to target the termination of the Agreements rather than amendment, since KT currently remains a private company, de jure or de facto. ...|$|R

30|$|Consequently, the {{analysis}} of the price transmission has showed that antitrust intervention would seem have produced some substantial effects in the Italian pasta market by restoring a state of high competition among companies. This result is in line with part of the previous literature (Sabbatini 2008) on the effectiveness of authority intervention on markets in which collusion among firms is investigated and fined. However, among the reasons which could have pushed firms to a higher competition, {{it is important to consider}} that in the last years, as suggested by Cacchiarelli, Lass and Sorrentino (2016), in Italian pasta supply chain the role played by retailers is decisively more important. In fact, retailers, entering pasta market through private labels, have improved their bargaining power toward pasta makers. Based on the last sentences, it is worthwhile to briefly underline the importance of competition law in the food supply chain which connects sectors with a very articulated structure. The agricultural sector is characterized by highly fragmented production while the market structure in processing and retailing stages is much more concentrated (EU 2009; Russo et al. 2011). This often allows processors and retailers to exert their potential market power to extract rent from government interventions sustaining farmers by different forms of subsidies (Russo et al. 2011; Sexton 2013). Therefore, for an effective antitrust policy it is crucial both the monitoring activities of antitrust authority and the measures of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which can be successful in rebalancing the market power among the sectors of the agro-food chains. In effect, although national antitrust authorities can intervene, as we demonstrated in this paper, by restoring a state of competition among companies this is not sufficient to prevent <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conducts.</b> This goal can be reached through a policy which might improve the bargaining power of farmers. In this direction, we consider very useful the measures of the 2013 CAP Reform to strengthen and extend the role for Producer Organisation and Interbrunch Organisation in all agricultural sectors for their capability to concentrate producers’ supply and provide alternative marketing channels with more balanced contracts and transactions.|$|R
40|$|In the US {{and in the}} EU, the {{antitrust}} rules on single-firm conduct are currently under review. Antitrust authorities {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic are reconsidering the tests to be applied in order to distinguish between lawful competition on the merits and exclusionary conduct. In the transatlantic comparison that accompanies the review, it has been observed that in the US, the tests for identifying <b>anti-competitive</b> single-firm <b>conduct</b> under Sec. 2 Sherman Act are frequently more narrowly construed than the tests applied in the EU under Art. 82 EC. A standard explanation for the divergence is an in-built regulatory tendency of EU competition law which is frequently ascribed to German ordoliberal influence – a theory supposedly antagonistic to sound economic analysis. This paper challenges this view. Tracing the history of Art. 82 EC and comparing US and EU competition law attitudes towards exploitative abuses, predatory prices and refusals to deal, it argues that transatlantic differences are sometimes less pronounced than is claimed, and may be explained by valid economic and normative reasons where they exist. Along the way, the paper attempts to clarify the frequently misinterpreted concept of ordoliberalism. European law...|$|R

Although the thesis focuses on EU law, it also seeks inspiration from the approach in other jurisdictions. A comparative study includes relevant cases from various EU Member States (France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK) and non-EU jurisdictions (Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Africa and the US).

40|$|The {{trend of}} retail {{concentration}} across the European Union has raised concerns on the buyer power that retailers {{may have in}} the relation with their suppliers. Specifically, due to the alleged increasing pressure on producer and supplier margins in various distribution chains, but the increased focus on consumer welfare in EU competition policy, various stakeholders call for demands {{for a change in}} the current substantive legal framework of EU competition law. In this discussion, reference is often made to initiatives at the national level that are specifically designed to deal with disparities in market power in business-to-business relations, such as prohibitions on so-called ‘abuse of economic dependency’ or ‘abuse of superior bargaining position’. This Law and Economics research addresses the underlying premise for these requests and therefore analyses whether there is a ‘gap’ in the current substantive legal framework of EU competition law, which may cause the underenforcement of the potential harmful effects of buyer power. That is, by applying the conceptual apparatus of economics to the field of EU competition law, it has been assessed from an economic efficiency perspective whether the competition rules provide for a legal basis to address the potential competition concerns of buyer power. The results show that the EU competition rules are readily applicable to buyer conduct and moreover provide for a legal basis to address the potential competition concerns of buyer power. The analysis therefore does not indicate that that the current substantive legal framework of EU competition law is unfit to address the potential harmful effects of buyer power. However, a critical comment is in place with regard to the application of the consumer welfare standard that appears to be used in EU competition policy. While the consumer welfare standard will generally not lead to very different decisions than its alternative, the total welfare standard, and may moreover be preferable due to mitigate regulation costs and undesirable lobbying, it has a specific disadvantage in the context of buyer power. Since buyer power may under specific circumstances harm economic efficiency but does not necessarily directly affect consumer welfare, application of the consumer welfare standard might lead to underenforcement of <b>anti-competitive</b> buyer <b>conduct.</b> There are, however, various indications that the European Commission is aware of this risk and may moreover refrain from the application of the consumer welfare standard in specific buyer power cases. Because this suggests that there is a discrepancy between the actual treatment of buyer conduct and the approach outlined in the European Commission’s guidelines, it seems advisable that these guidelines are clarified...|$|R
40|$|Joint ventures are {{a popular}} form of {{enterprise}} {{structure in the}} resources sector in Australia. Despite the absence of hard data, {{it is estimated that}} at least half the expenditure on mineral exploration and virtually all petroleum exploration in Australia {{in recent years has been}} through joint venture arrangements. So it is elsewhere, and in other fields. In resource exploration and exploitation, engineering and construction, manufacturing, and research and development, various forms of joint ventures are being relied on increasingly as vehicles for business. In competition policy terms, the creation and activities of joint ventures present special. problems. Whereas competition policy seeks to encourage competition between participants in the marketplace, joint venture arrangements involve cooperation between participants, often resulting in a lessening of competition. There are advantages and disadvantages to be weighed; a balancing test involving beneficial economic effects, and anti-competitive detriments. The task of legislators and competition authorities (in Australia, the Trade Practices Commission) has been and remains to develop and implement a framework which allows joint ventures to develop in an economically beneficial way, whilst at the same time circumscribing their anti-competitive effects. The object of this paper is to examine the approach to this problem which has been developed in Australia, and distilled in the Trade Practices Act 1974 ("the Act"), in the context of resources joint ventures. It is timely to undertake such an examination The Act has now been in force for 15 years and its principles have been applied in a number of determinations, particularly in the last two years. I have adopted what I hope is a relatively straightforward approach to this task. First, in Part 2 of the paper, I attempt to identify the characteristics of resources joint ventures in Australia which are significant in the context of competition policy. Also in this part, I outline the costs and benefits of joint ventures, as they are perceived in competition theory. Secondly, in Part 3 of the paper, I describe the competition provisions of Part IV of the Trade Practices Act, and the adjudication provisions set out in Part VII. Whilst these will be familiar to many readers, they are included here not only for the sake of completeness and the aid of those unfamiliar with the Act, but also because a detailed understanding of these provisions is essential to the analysis and discussion which follows. These provisions embody the regulatory approach to the problem, which is in essence to subject joint ventures to the full spectrum of competition laws (with limited exceptions), but subject to an adjudication process which permits authorised contraventions on public benefit grounds. In Part 4, the meaning of some concepts which are essential to the practical application of the competition and authorisation provisions (namely, "competition", "market", "public benefit" and "dominance") is explained. This is done by reference to decided cases and also to the determinations of the Trade Practices Commission ("the Commission") in the case studies discussed in the Schedule to this paper. Part 5 of the paper examines the competition issues which arise upon the formation of a joint venture. This involves a consideration of Section 50 of the Act (which proscribes mergers or acquisitions leading to market dominance) in relation to the joint venturers individually (the "parents") and the joint venture itself (the "child"). In Part 6, I examine some specific provisions of resources joint venture agreements which have the potential to contravene the Act. These are, namely, area of mutual interest, assignment and non-competition provisions. Also in this part, the trade practices implications of joint venturers' cooperative marketing and joint acquisition arrangements are considered. Throughout the paper, extensive references are made to various determinations of the Commission made since the inception of the Act, which involve resources joint ventures. Summaries of these determinations and the issues which they have considered are set out in the Schedule. These cases provide practical illustrations of the types of competition issues to which resources joint ventures give rise, and the public benefits which have been accepted as outweighing anti-competitive detriment. It is important to emphasize at the outset that competition policy does not operate in a vacuum. Not only does the cause of competition require to be subordinated from time to time to the greater economic benefits which flow from joint ventures; it must also take its place in the ranks of other government policies, not all of which are compatible with it. Examples of this dilemma can be found in the paper; specifically with respect to government policies dealing with crude oil marketing and tenement licensing. Reconciliation of these conflicting policy goals is of course the daunting task of the bureaucracy and the legislature. It is also important to acknowledge the matters which I have not addressed in this paper. First, I have confined my analysis to those provisions of agreements or types of conduct which are an integral part of, or peculiar to, resources joint ventures. This is not to say however that this paper presents a comprehensive picture of the interface between resources joint ventures and competition law. Many activities engaged in by joint venturers with respect to their joint ventures may involve <b>anti-competitive</b> forms of <b>conduct</b> (such as exclusive dealing, tying, predatory pricing or refusals to deal) which invoke the provisions of the Act. However, these forms of conduct are not peculiar to joint ventures, and it is not within the scope of this paper to deal with them. Secondly, the paper is confined to an analysis of the Australian Trade Practices Act. The extra-territorial application of foreign competition and anti-trust laws is not addressed. (2) Thirdly, the paper does not contain any comparative analysis of competition laws in other countries. The issues which are discussed in this paper have been addressed (to varying extents) in the United States, Canada, Japan and the EEC nations. Had time and space permitted, it would have been of interest to compare the approaches adopted by these various countries, and to consider whether an alternative approach should be adopted here. (3) Shortly before this paper was completed, the High Court handed down its decision in the Queensland Wire case (4) The decision in that case has signalled the court's preparedness to adopt a purposive approach to the application of the Act, bearing in mind its objective of fostering competition. This, coupled with the more visible and assertive role being adopted by the Commission, has heightened and reinforced the need for joint venturers to have the Act, and competition policy generally, firmly in mind when contemplating their agreements and arrangementsRestricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

The Justice Department said this was the first case resulting from a continuing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging, and other <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> in the petroleum industry.William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said [...] "His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land. Executives who abuse their positions as leaders of major corporations to organize criminal activity must be held accountable for their actions.” ...|$|E

This paper proposes a simple oligopoly model which raises the possibility that such <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> and R&D investment are complementary activities for incumbents. Consequently, an institutional framework or technological possibilities which encourage <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conduct,</b> although impeding entry of potential rivals and accentuating standard oligopoly distortions, may foster R&D-based growth and welfare. However, this outcome is less likely if entrants exert technological spillover effects, e. g. through foreign direct investment. Stronger protection of intellectual property rights, although triggering <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> and thereby impeding market entry as well, is more likely to foster economic growth. ...|$|E
40|$|International {{trade has}} changed {{some of the}} {{challenges}} faced by antitrust authorities: it has added an international dimension. Under {{the current system of}} international antitrust, the backbone of enforcement is unilateral: each country applies its own tools to deal with international antitrust issues within the constraints imposed upon it by public international law. This enforcement pattern is sometimes coupled with cooperation agreements which are based on the realization that while cooperation among firms might be anti-competitive, this is generally not true for cooperation among countries. Yet such cooperation is often limited. This paper, which is part of a book on Cooperation, Comity And Competition Policy (Oxford University Press, 2009), analyzes the effects that a unilateral enforcement system has on a small economy, by focusing on a specific case study: Israel. The case of Israel is interesting not only as a stand-alone case study, but mostly because it provides useful insights into the reality of enforcing antitrust in a globalized world by a small economy. As the paper indicates, even when it possesses the legal tools to tackle international antitrust issues, Israel often suffer from serious practical deficiencies. Most importantly, it frequently cannot create a credible threat to large, multinational firms that engage in <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> which harms its economy. It also has limited resources and incentives to deal with international <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conduct,</b> especially when such conduct is addressed by other jurisdictions. As a result, despite the sometimes severe effects of <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> on its markets, Israel, like other small economies, is a marginal player in the globalized antitrust regime and is generally a passive bearer of the effects of international <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> and of the enforcement actions of larger jurisdictions rather than proactive confronters of such issues and actions. This observation has important implications for a globalized antitrust regime. The paper also analyzes some intriguing issues which arise from public international law doctrines of extraterritoriality. For example, it analyzes the issue of whether the effects doctrine acts as a pre-condition for a finding of an <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> if some of the parties are foreign or does it apply only if there is a finding of an <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> that has direct legal implications for a foreign firm. It also analyzes the issue of whether presumptions of illegality can apply in cases which involve foreign firms and in which jurisdiction is based on proof of 2 ̆ 2 a significant and direct 2 ̆ 2 anti-competitive effect...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{contribute}} to the discussion on the internationalisation of competition law. Within that context the thesis has three objectives: first, to determine the nature of the competition law problems created by commercial globalisation; secondly, to determine whether the existing mix of domestic and international rules is capable of solving those problems; and thirdly, having regard to the conclusions drawn in respect of the previous objectives, to determine the minimum rules required. Competition law is still predominantly domestic law. Business and commerce, however, is increasingly internationalised. This creates tensions that may require an international solution. International competition law issues - international <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> - may be divided into four categories; conduct designed to exclude imports, export cartels, international cartels and international single firm conduct. A fifth category, mergers, is not discussed in this thesis. The regulatory problems differ depending on the category of conduct concerned. This means that unless a broad-based solution is preferred, solutions will vary depending on the category of conduct. International rules, however, should only be sought if existing regulatory approaches are inadequate. If existing approaches are capable of evolving to solve the problems of international <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conduct,</b> there is no justification for and little prospect of new international rules. To determine this it is necessary to investigate unilateral, bilateral and multilateral approaches. Unilateralism has advantages, but in a shrinking world it is deeply flawed as long as nations have different policies and legal preferences. Regulatory cooperation is evolving, but within a non-binding structure. Some of the problems associated with international anticompetitive conduct are likely to be resistant to non-binding approaches because they involve protectionism. A possibly relevant binding set of multilateral rules already exists {{in the shape of the}} agreements that make up the World Trade Organisation. These may be capable of solving some of the problems of international <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conduct.</b> However, they will not solve all the problems. For these reasons new rules are required. There are theoretical, practical and institutional reasons why attempts to construct comprehensive rules should be avoided. Any new rules should be the minimum required. This thesis concludes with outline proposals for the minimum rules required to solve the four categories of international <b>anti-competitive</b> <b>conduct...</b>|$|E
