New vocals were combined with previously released tracks and new Synclavier music. In addition to the new songs, the previously recorded songs include new overdubs moving this storyline forward. As the recording process continued, Zappa brought in revised scripts and improved the work by editing or changing aspects with which he was dissatisfied.|$|E

500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Savoy Truffle" [...] as {{a tribute}} to Clapton's {{chocolate}} addiction. He derived the title and much of the lyrics from a box of Mackintosh's Good News chocolates, which Clapton began eating during one of his visits to Harrison's home. Many of the confectionery names used in the song are authentic; others, such as cherry cream, coconut fudge and pineapple heart, were Harrison's invention, based on the flavours listed inside the lid of the box. For the lyrics to the second of the song's middle eight sections, Harrison received assistance from Derek Taylor, the press officer for the Beatles' new record label, Apple Records. In keeping with the theme of Harrison's composition, Taylor drew inspiration from the title of the American counterculture film You <b>Are</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Eat, which was itself titled after a fashionable macrobiotic slogan.|$|E

The album included one complex instrumental, [...] "Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear", but focused mainly on rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics targeted at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy. [...] "Dumb All Over" [...] is a tirade on religion, as is [...] "Heavenly Bank Account", wherein Zappa rails against TV evangelists such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson for their purported influence on the U.S. administration {{as well as their}} use of religion as a means of raising money. Songs like [...] "Society Pages" [...] and [...] "I'm a Beautiful Guy" [...] show Zappa's dismay with the Reagan era and its [...] "obscene pursuit of wealth and happiness".|$|E
500|$|The Village Voices Sean Fennessey {{commented that}} the {{production}} by Bink! was gorgeous in nature.

[...] Craig Jenkins [...] of Prefix Music opined that [...] "Bink’s beat for 'Devil in a New Dress' peters out midway through, and a live band plays a sultry, emotive take on that beat." [...] Andrew Barber of Complex stated that for the people disappointed in the briefness of the verses provided by Ross on [...] "Monster", this track more than makes up for it.

On the compilation's title, Aguilera said: [...] "I'm looking forward to the next 10 years, which is partly why I named the album, Keeps Gettin' Better, 'cause it does". People who pre-ordered the compilation would receive a free digital download version of the single [...] "Keeps Gettin' Better". During an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Aguilera explained that Target [...] "got such a great creative team", and that's why she worked with the retailer for the album. Released in November 2008, Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits features all of Aguilera's hits from her previous studio albums released up to 2008 and four new songs produced by Linda Perry. Two of which are remakes of her previous singles, [...] "Genie 2.0" [...] ("Genie in a Bottle"), and [...] "You <b>Are</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Are (Beautiful)" [...] ("Beautiful").

[...] "Devil in a New Dress" [...] contains lyrics about lust and heartache, with sexual and religious imagery described by one critic as [...] "part bedroom allure, part angelic prayer". Rap-Up called it a [...] "female-focused song" [...] and a [...] "soulful track, boasting a slow-rolling beat with a haunting vocal sample.” Alex Koening of Knightnews wrote [...] "over piano flourishes and a scintillating string section contain some of the funniest tongue-in-cheek lyrics about women Kanye ever managed: 'I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat/ I ordered the jerk, she said you <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> eat.'

Yahoo! writer Lyndsey Parker remarked about Trainor's fashion in the video; and said it [...] "seems to be an unofficial campaign to land her own M.A.C. Viva Glam endorsement deal". Fuse's Hilary Hughes wrote that the video was a bold and sassy sentiment, and that its style shift from [...] "All About That Bass" [...] "definitely made a statement".
