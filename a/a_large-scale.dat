40|$|Abstract. Downward {{communication}} {{is a popular}} push-based scheme to forward messages from headquarters to front-line staff in <b>a</b> <b>large-scaled</b> company. With the maturing intranet and web technology, broadcasting algorithms, including pull-based and push-based broadcasting algorithms, it is feasible to send downward messages through web-based design by sending packets on a network. To avoid losing messages {{due to the traditional}} push-based method, companies adopt a pull-based algorithm to build up the broadcasting system. However, although the pull-based method can ensure that a message is received, it has a critical problem, the network is always congested. The push-based method can avoid congesting the network, but it needs a specific robust design to ensure that the message reaches its destination. Hence, adopting only a pull-based or a push-based broadcasting algorithm is no longer feasible especially not for <b>a</b> <b>large-scaled</b> company with complex network architecture. To ensure that every receiver will read downward messages thereby reducing the consumption of network bandwidth, this work proposes a robust web-based push- and pull-based broadcasting system for sending downward messages. This proposed system was successfully applied to <b>a</b> <b>large-scaled</b> company for <b>a</b> one-year period...|$|R

5|$|Conversely, {{there are}} no records of <b>a</b> <b>large-scale</b> Greek slave revolt {{comparable}} to that of Spartacus in Rome. It can probably be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning. Slave revolts were rare, even in Rome. Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.|$|E

The Khazars, on their part, only launched a few raids into the Transcaucasian principalities that were loosely under Muslim dominion: in 661/662, they launched a raid into Albania but were defeated by the local prince; in 683 or 685 (also a time of civil war in the Muslim world), <b>a</b> <b>large-scale</b> raid across Transcaucasia was more successful, capturing much booty and many prisoners.|$|E
5|$|General Eisenhower had {{reviewed}} the airborne role in Operation Husky, and {{had concluded that}} large-scale formations were too difficult to control in combat to be practical. Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, commander of Army Ground Forces, had similar misgivings: once an airborne supporter, he had been greatly disappointed by their performance in North Africa and, more recently, Sicily. However, other high-ranking officers believed otherwise, notably the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, George Marshall. He persuaded Eisenhower {{to set up a}} review board and to withhold judgement on the effectiveness of divisional-sized airborne forces until <b>a</b> <b>large-scale</b> maneuver could be tried in December. When Swing returned to the United States to resume command of the 11th Airborne Division in mid-September 1943, he had an additional role. McNair ordered him to form a committeethe Swing Board–composed of U.S. Army Air Forces, parachute and glider infantry, and artillery officers to arrange <b>a</b> <b>large-scale</b> maneuver that would effectively decide the fate of the divisional-sized airborne force. As the 11th Airborne Division was in reserve in the United States, and had not yet been earmarked for overseas shipment, the Swing Board chose it as the test formation; it would be opposed by a composite combat team from the 17th Airborne Division with a battalion from the 541st Parachute Infantry Regiment temporarily attached. The maneuver would also provide both divisions with further airborne training, as had occurred several months previously in <b>a</b> <b>large-scale</b> maneuver undertaken by the 82nd and the 101st Airborne Divisions.|$|E
