5|$|McLamore and Edgerton {{acquired}} {{a license to}} operate an Insta-Burger King franchise and opened their first location on 4 December 1954 at 3090 NW 36th Street in Miami. By 1959, the pair had stores at several locations within the Miami-Dade area, and operations were growing at a fast rate. However, the partners discovered that the insta-broiler units' heating elements were prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas grill that avoided the problems by cooking the meat patties a different way inside the unit. The new cooking appliance, which they called a flame broiler, moved the patties over the flame vertically on a chain link conveyor over the heating elements, a design that imparted grill lines on the patties similar to those made on <b>a</b> <b>charcoal</b> grill. The new unit worked so well that they {{made the decision to}} replace all of their Insta-Broilers with the newly designed unit.|$|E

25|$|At {{temperatures}} above 550°C {{the equilibrium}} CO2 pressure begins {{to exceed the}} CO2 pressure in air. So above 550°C, calcium carbonate begins to outgas CO2 into air. However, in <b>a</b> <b>charcoal</b> fired kiln, the concentration of CO2 will be much higher {{than it is in}} air. Indeed, if all the oxygen in the kiln is consumed in the fire, then the partial pressure of CO2 in the kiln can be as high as 20 kPa.|$|E

25|$|Gui are grilled dishes, {{which most}} {{commonly}} have meat or fish {{as their primary}} ingredient, but may in some cases also comprise grilled vegetables or other vegetable ingredients. At traditional restaurants, meats are cooked {{at the center of}} the table over <b>a</b> <b>charcoal</b> grill, surrounded by various banchan and individual rice bowls. The cooked meat is then cut into small pieces and wrapped with fresh lettuce leaves, with rice, thinly sliced garlic, ssamjang (a mixture of gochujang and dwenjang), and other seasonings. The suffix gui is often omitted in the names of meat-based gui such as galbi, the name of which was originally galbi gui.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>charcoal</b> briquette, or briquet is a {{block of}} {{flammable}} charcoal matter which is used as fuel to start and maintain a fire, mainly used for food preparation over an open fire or a barbecue. Charcoal briquettes are made by using a process which consists of compressing charcoal, typically made from sawdust and other wood by-products, with a binder and other additives. The binder is usually starch. Some charcoal briquettes may also include brown coal, mineral carbon, borax, sodium nitrate, limestone, raw sawdust, and other additives like paraffin or petroleum solvents to aid in ignition. The design of the charcoal briquette was invented and patented by Ellsworth B. A. Zwoyer in 1897.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of Gustave's birth his father, an ex-soldier, was working as an {{administrator}} for the French Army; but shortly after his birth, his mother expanded <b>a</b> <b>charcoal</b> business, and soon afterwards his father gave up his job to assist her. Due to his mother's business commitments, Gustave spent his childhood living with his grandmother, but nevertheless remained close to his mother, who was to remain an influential figure until her death in 1878. The business was successful enough for Catherine Eiffel to sell it in 1843 and retire on the proceeds. Eiffel was not a studious child, and thought his classes at the Lycée Royal in Dijon boring and a waste of time, although in his last two years, influenced by his teachers for history and literature, he began to study seriously, and he gained his baccalauréats in humanities and science.|$|E

25|$|Australian Indigenous art is {{the oldest}} {{unbroken}} tradition {{of art in the}} world. The oldest firmly dated rock art painting in Australia is <b>a</b> <b>charcoal</b> drawing on a rock fragment found during the excavation of the Narwala Gabarnmang rock shelter in south-western Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. Dated at 28,000 years, {{it is one of the}} oldest known pieces of rock art on Earth with a confirmed date. Rock art, including painting and engraving or carving, can be found at sites throughout Australia. Rock paintings appear on caves in the Kimberley region of Western Australia known as Bradshaws. They are named after the European, Joseph Bradshaw, who first reported them in 1891. To Aboriginal people of the region they are known as Gwion Gwion or Giro Giro. Other painted rock art sites include Laura, Queensland, Ubirr, in the Kakadu National Park, Uluru, and Carnarvon Gorge.|$|E

25|$|The New York Iron and Coal Company {{created the}} first {{business}} venture in {{what was to become}} McIntyre Township in when they constructed a sawmill on Lycoming Creek. The New York Iron and Coal Company also built an iron furnace near the mouth of Frozen Run in 1831. They began to make iron using iron ore that was mined nearby. The company also established <b>a</b> <b>charcoal</b> making operation for the fuel that was needed to keep the furnaces fired. The iron industry had little success in McIntyre. The ore was difficult to clean, it could only be separated from the dirt that was mixed in when it was frozen. And the ore that they did manage to extract produced iron that proved to be very brittle. The reason that several companies attempted to succeed in what proved to be a failing enterprise {{was the fact that the}} furnace was within easy distance of the Williamsport and Elmira Railroad which connected the industrial centers of Williamsport, Pennsylvania and Elmira, New York.|$|E
