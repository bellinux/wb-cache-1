5000|$|Digital fuel injection, {{introduced}} for California bound 1982 Volvo 240 models. The 'LH' {{stands for}} [...] "Luftmasse-Hitzdraht" [...] - the hotwire anemometer technology {{used to determine}} the mass of air into the engine. This <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> <b>meter</b> is called HLM2 (Hitzdraht-LuftMassenmesser 2) by Bosch. The LH-Jetronic was mostly used by Scandinavian car manufacturers, and by sports and luxury cars produced in small quantities, such as Porsche 928. The most common variants are LH 2.2, which uses an Intel 8049 (MCS-48) microcontroller, and usually a 4 kB programme memory, and LH 2.4, which uses a Siemens 80535 microcontroller (a variant of Intel's 8051/MCS-51 architecture) and 32 kB programme memory based on the 27C256 chip. LH-Jetronic 2.4 has adaptive lambda control, and support for a variety of advanced features; including fuel enrichment based on exhaust gas temperature (ex. Volvo B204GT/B204FT engines). Some later (post-1995) versions contain hardware support for first generation diagnostics according to ISO 9141 (a.k.a. OBD-II) and immobiliser functions.|$|E
40|$|A fuel {{injection}} engine {{in a vehicle}} requires a good air flow to sustain high performance. The air is supplied by the air filter system and the flow though the system is measured by an <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> <b>meter.</b> Volvo performs CFD analysis on the air filter system using a procedure to find pressure loss and flow uniformity index. This thesis presents two CFD procedures designed to improve analysis {{of these types of}} systems. The first is dedicated to predicting the flow through the air mass flow sensor present in the system. Experiments show that at low mass flows the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> <b>meter</b> signal is affected by a noise. Current simulation procedures cannot predict this noise and a new procedure were needed. The procedure developed could not find the signal noise but {{can be used as a}} basis for a future transient analysis procedure at Volvo. The second is an optimization procedure designed to find the optimal design for any given geometries in the system with respect to pressure losses and flow uniformity index. The optimization procedure showed promise in finding optimal designs and will be of used in future development. The procedures are tested and developed on existing air filter systems. Experiments were performed with the system in a flow rig and verified the simulated results. Validerat; 20110725 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|The {{estimation}} of the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> in the cylinder of a spark ignition (SI) engine is crucial in order to regulate the exact air fuel (A/F) ratio for the catalyst and thus minimize the emissions. Conventional algorithms for estimating the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> are based on sensor information measured {{in front of the}} throttle or in the manifold. Thus, the determination of cylinder individual sizes, particularly the <b>air</b> <b>mass,</b> is impossible. In this work, new sensors, which provide cylinder individual information are investigated and the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> in each individual cylinder is calculated with adaptive, model based algorithms. Sensors within the combustion chamber of an SI engine enable a cylinder specific evaluation of the thermodynamic work process. In particular, the combustion pressure sensor or ionisation current sensing are two independent methods of measuring direct combustion information. In a few cases such sensors are used in mass production cars. The combustion pressure sensor exhibits two significant advantages when compared to ionisation current. First, it provides information of the pressure in the cylinder during the complete working cycle of the engine and this pressure information {{is a measure of the}} entire combustion chamber. In contrast, the ionisation sensing represents a local measurement during the combustion and part of the expansion phase and this measurement can only be seen as a part of the information contained in the combustion pressure sensor signal. Second, the determination of the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> in the cylinder, the most significant process information, can only be determined by cylinder pressure measurements and not by ionisation current. Reducing costs by eliminating the <b>mass</b> <b>air</b> flow <b>meter</b> is a requirement for the implementation of combustion pressure sensors in a mass production throttled SI engine. Thus, the cylinder pressure sensor must be able to determine the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> in the cylinder. However, the cylinder pressure sensors will not be implemented in a mass production application based only on replacing the <b>mass</b> <b>air</b> flow <b>meter,</b> but must in addition provide much more cylinder specific information. This might change in future with new engine concepts. Available from: [URL] / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEDEGerman...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{automobile}} engines require precise {{regulation of}} air-fuel ratio #A#F# to attain high catalytic converter e#ciency and minimize tailpipe emissions. During engine transients, good A#F control requires, in turn, accurate {{estimation of the}} air charge entering the cylinders during each induction event.
