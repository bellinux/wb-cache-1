5|$|After enrolling him, Smith signed Burdell {{up for all}} {{the same}} classes he had. Smith would do all {{schoolwork}} twice, changing it slightly to avoid professors catching his sham. When he had a test, he would take it twice <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> it in under both names. By 1930, the school had awarded Burdell a bachelor's degree, {{and a few years}} later awarded the fictitious student a master's degree. The college listed him as an official alumnus, even though his name has remained on the active student rolls. In 1930, the ANAK Society, Georgia Tech's oldest secret society, offered Burdell membership.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Colonel Michaelis {{went to the}} 1st Cavalry Division command post in Hwanggan and asked {{division}} commander Major General Hobart R. Gay for permission to withdraw his regiment through that division. Gay telephoned the Eighth Army headquarters {{and asked if he}} should attack in an effort to relieve the pressure on the 27th Infantry, or if that regiment should withdraw into the 1st Cavalry Division's area, move south to Kumch'on, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> toward Sangju to rejoin the 25th Division. The Eighth Army decided the 27th Regiment should withdraw, as Gay feared it would quickly be surrounded if it tried to hold its position.|$|E
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare {{usually has}} a single stem, but {{occasionally}} several stems arise from a thick common base. It attaches {{to the side of}} the cap and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base. Its surface is covered with hairy fibers (especially near the base), and its mature color is a dark chestnut brown. The cap is semicircular or kidney-shaped, flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. However, it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken to the point of being almost black. The cap margin is usually buff to light brown–roughly the same color as the spines and lighter in color than the center. It becomes rolled inward (revolute) and often wavy in maturity. The spines on the underside of the cap are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White to light brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> an ashy gray. Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely.|$|E

5|$|Now {{with three}} lanes in each direction, the highway {{straddles}} {{the boundary between}} Salt Lake City and West Valley City, another suburb of the former. The road continues due east with diamond interchanges at 5600 West (SR-172) and Bangerter Highway (SR-154). Immediately following a single-point urban interchange (SPUI) at 3200 West, the freeway intersects I-215 {{in the form of}} a cloverleaf interchange. The road dips to the south slightly and, following two SPUIs at Redwood Road (SR-68) and 900 West, the freeway terminates at the Spaghetti Bowl interchange, giving eastbound motorists on SR-201 the option of continuing to I-15, I-80, 1300 South and 900 South. However, an eastbound traveler wanting to continue on the surface portion of SR-201 to State Street must exit on 900 West, head north briefly <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> eastbound on 2100 South; a westbound traveler on 2100 South wishing to connect to the freeway must take an on-ramp from the surface street just before 900 West. Prior to 1997, this connection was direct. Now on the four-lane 2100 South, a secondary surface street, the route runs along the Salt Lake City-South Salt Lake border. State maintenance of 2100 South ends at the intersection of State Street (US-89).|$|E

25|$|Left arm {{orthodox}} spin bowlers generally {{attempt to}} drift {{the ball in}} the air into a right-handed batsman, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> it away from the batsman (towards off-stump) upon landing on the pitch. The drift and turn in the air are attacking techniques. The left-arm orthodox spin like an off break or off spin is also a bowling action.|$|E

25|$|Delancey Street in Manhattan has two lanes on the {{eastbound}} side {{adjacent to}} the median used for westbound traffic in the morning rush hour between the Williamsburg Bridge and Allen Street. All traffic in these lanes must continue to <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> left onto Allen, during these times left turns are prohibited from the regular westbound roadway onto Allen Street.|$|E
25|$|Grant {{reacted to}} this final repulse by {{deciding}} to abandon this general {{area as a}} battlefield. He ordered Hancock's II Corps to march to the railroad line between Fredericksburg and Richmond, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> south. With luck, Lee might take the bait and follow, seeking to overwhelm and destroy the isolated corps. In that case, Grant would chase Lee with his remaining corps and strike him before the Confederates could entrench again.|$|E
25|$|Soon—possibly by 1958, when {{numbers were}} assigned—I-95 between Baltimore and Washington was shifted to its present alignment, {{splitting}} from the US50 corridor northeast of Union Station. I-295 was shifted {{to cross the}} 11th Street Bridges, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> east in the median of present I-695 (where the ramps to RFK Stadium now lie), continuing north and northwest to end at I-95 and US50 at their split. I-695 would be the short section of freeway between I-95 and I-295, and ramps {{on both sides of}} the East Capitol Street Bridge would provide a freeway-to-freeway connection between I-695 and DC295 (via I-295).|$|E

25|$|From 1974 to 1981, NASA's Glenn Research Center (then the Lewis Research Center) in Brook Park, Ohio led the U.S. Wind Energy Program {{for large}} horizontal-axis wind turbines, {{designing}} {{a series of}} 13 experimental large horizontal-axis wind turbines. In conjunction with the United States Department of Energy, NASA developed and tested megawatt-class wind turbines. The program's goal was to develop the technology, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> it over to private industry. While none of the program's wind turbine designs saw mass commercialization, the tests generated valuable data and pioneered modern design concepts such as tubular towers and computer control of blade pitch and rotor yaw.|$|E
25|$|Eclipse {{continues}} {{the drama of}} Bella and Edward's relationship. Edward explains that he is reluctant to change Bella into a vampire because he believes that vampires are soulless creatures who {{have no place in}} heaven. Bella, whose opinion of marriage is jaded by her own parents' early divorce, agrees to marry Edward on the condition that he will make love with her while she is still human <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> her into a vampire. He initially refuses, saying that he could easily lose control {{in the heat of the}} moment and unintentionally kill her. However, seeing how important it is to Bella, he agrees to try, but only after they are married.|$|E
25|$|While Halleck {{accomplished}} little following Corinth, Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg succeeded Beauregard (on June 27, {{for health}} reasons) {{in command of}} his 56,000 troops of the Army of Tennessee, in Tupelo, Mississippi, due south of Corinth. But he determined that an advance directly north from Tupelo was not practical. He left Maj. Gens. Sterling Price and Earl Van Dorn to distract Grant and shifted 35,000 men by rail through Mobile, Alabama, to Chattanooga. Even {{though he did not}} leave Tupelo until July 21, he was able to reach Chattanooga before Buell could. Bragg's general plan was to invade Kentucky in a joint operation with Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, cut Buell's lines of communications, defeat him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> back to defeat Grant.|$|E

25|$|Rosecrans was {{convinced}} that Bragg was demoralized and fleeing to either Dalton, Rome, or Atlanta, Georgia. Instead, Bragg's Army of Tennessee was encamped at LaFayette, some 20 miles (32km) south of Chattanooga. Confederate soldiers who posed as deserters deliberately added to this impression. Thomas firmly cautioned Rosecrans that a pursuit of Bragg was unwise because the Army of the Cumberland was too widely dispersed and its supply lines were tenuous. Rosecrans, exultant at his success in capturing Chattanooga, discounted Thomas's advice. He ordered McCook to swing across Lookout Mountain at Winston's Gap and use his cavalry to break Bragg's railroad supply line at Resaca, Georgia. Crittenden was to take Chattanooga <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> south in pursuit of Bragg. Thomas was to continue his advance toward LaFayette.|$|E
25|$|Sheridan {{believed}} that understanding the topography of the Shenandoah Valley {{would give him}} a strategic and tactical advantage. By the summer of 1864, Meigs was {{recognized as one of the}} best mapmakers in the Union Army. At his base in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, he spent hours being tutored by Meigs on the layout of the valley. From Meigs, Sheridan learned that the long ridges in the Shenandoah were not the great protective barriers Union commanders had assumed. The ridges had a number of gaps. Confederate forces could ride north and south, screened by the ridges, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> through the gaps to initiate flank attacks on Union forces. Sheridan resolved to protect his flanks from these attacks, and take advantage of the gaps himself.|$|E
25|$|When Windows 95 started up, MS-DOS loaded, {{processed}} CONFIG.SYS, launched COMMAND.COM, ran AUTOEXEC.BAT {{and finally}} ran WIN.COM. The WIN.COM program used MS-DOS {{to load the}} virtual machine manager, read SYSTEM.INI, load the virtual device drivers, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> off any running copies of EMM386 and switch into protected mode. Once in protected mode, the virtual device drivers (VxDs) transferred all state information from MS-DOS to the 32-bit file system manager, and then shut off MS-DOS. These VxDs allow Windows 9x to interact with hardware resources directly, as providing low-level functionalities such as 32-bit disk access and memory management. All future file system operations would get routed to the 32-bit file system manager. In Windows ME, win.com was no longer executed during the startup process; instead it went directly to execute VMM32.VXD from IO.SYS.|$|E

25|$|Grant {{decided to}} abandon the Spotsylvania area. He ordered Hancock's II Corps to march to the {{railroad}} line between Fredericksburg and Richmond, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> south. With luck, Lee might take the bait and follow, seeking to overwhelm and destroy the isolated corps. In that case, Grant would chase Lee with his remaining corps and strike him before the Confederates could entrench again. Before Hancock began to move, Lee ordered Ewell to conduct a reconnaissance in force to locate the northern flank of the Union army. Ewell fought near the Harris farm with several units of Union heavy artillery soldiers who had recently been converted to infantry duty before he was recalled by Lee. Grant's intended advance of Hancock's corps was delayed by the Harris farm engagement, so the troops did not begin their movement south until the night of May 20–21. Lee did not fall into Grant's trap of attacking Hancock, but traveled on a parallel path to the North Anna River.|$|E
25|$|Junipero Serra Boulevard {{begins at}} exit 44 (Avalon Drive) of I-280, and travels {{north along the}} east side of I-280 as a four-lane divided highway with minimal intersections, just east of the ridge line of the San Francisco Peninsula that Skyline Boulevard (SR 35) travels along. The median ends when it crosses Hickey Boulevard; the portion of Hickey Boulevard east from Junipero Serra Boulevard to El Camino Real (SR 82) was built as part of that portion of Junipero Serra Boulevard to the north. The {{boulevard}} continues northwards with occasional intersections, some with access to I-280, before crossing to the west side of I-280 just north of Washington Street in Daly City and back to the east side north of School Street. At John Daly Boulevard, Junipero Serra Boulevard crosses I-280 for the final time and becomes part of SR 1; the northbound lanes simply cross over I-280, merging with the ramp that carries SR 1 from I-280 onto the boulevard, but southbound traffic must pass under Daly Boulevard, exit and loop over the bridge it just passed under, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> right onto Junipero Serra Boulevard.|$|E
25|$|Having won {{the first}} three stages of the Grand Slam Hoad was favoured to win the fourth <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> {{professional}} for a lucrative contract offered by Jack Kramer. In an upset, however, he lost the final in four sets to Rosewall in the United States Championship at Forest Hills. Hoad and Rosewall won the doubles title against Trabert and Seixas. At the Pacific Southwest Championships in September, {{the last leg of}} his overseas tour before returning to Australia, Hoad was beaten by Alex Olmedo in the third round. In early November he lost the final of the Queensland Championships to Ashley Cooper in five sets and was hindered by numbness in the serving arm between the elbow and the wrist. The following week Hoad had to retire from the New South Wales Championships during his first round match against Ross Sherriff due to a sore arm. In mid December Hoad and Rosewall competed in the final of the Victorian Championships which was their last final as amateurs as Rosewall turned professional {{at the end of the}} month. The final started late due to rain and was stopped due to darkness at two sets to one for Hoad but the following day Rosewall won the last two sets and the title. In late December Hoad was part of the Australian Davis Cup team which successfully defended the cup in the Challenge Round against the United States who were weakened by the absence of Tony Trabert who had turned professional in the fall of 1955. In his last Davis Cup appearance Hoad won both his singles rubbers, against Herbie Flam and Seixas, as well as his doubles match with Rosewall to help Australia to a 5–0 victory. At the end of the year Hoad was ranked No. 1 in the world for the first time in his career.|$|E
