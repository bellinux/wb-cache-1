5|$|Room 5 is of {{identical}} proportions as rooms 2 and 4. It was extremely well preserved, including the rear {{wall of the}} bench <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> used {{as a model for}} investigations of the other rooms in Structure 4.|$|E
5|$|The dining room, on {{the other}} hand, saw {{extensive}} remodeling in 1895. The room size was increased by {{the construction of a}} bay window, parquet floor was installed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> decorated in cherry woodwork, with a gilt and crystal chandelier and sconces. The only original item remaining left in the room was the fireplace mantel. The Pink Room, named for the pink damask which covered the walls in 1895, the library, the Best Chamber (Daisy Grubb's bedroom), was also extensively remodeled.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremonial}} {{entrance to}} the north-west of the station, St Andrew's Gate, was officially opened on 16 December 1957 to mark the link between Uxbridge and the Royal Air Force. A memorial to the personnel of No. 11 Group, made of Cornish granite, {{was placed in the}} ground above the Operations Room in 1957. No. 11 Group moved to RAF Martlesham Heath on 14 April 1958 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> soon sealed in its original condition. The memorial was unveiled by Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding on 23 April 1958 in a ceremony attended by Group Captain Douglas Bader and Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, among others, and marked by a flypast of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. Control of RAF Hillingdon passed from Fighter Command to Technical Training Command that year, at which time the entire site became known as RAF Uxbridge. The RAF School of Education moved into Hillingdon House from RAF Spitalgate on 10 November 1958, and the station was subsequently merged with No. 22 Group RAF.|$|E

500|$|In 1970, Amos Avery donated 100 {{acres of}} land to the Mashantucket Land Trust and kept the {{surrounding}} 40 acres. Amos Avery also restored the house to a [...] "more or less" [...] 18th-century appearance through a decade-long restoration effort. The restoration effort began in the mid-1950s when he poked {{a hole in the}} ceiling and felt the molding, spurring his desire to see what was underneath. The ceiling was removed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> restored and then it moved to the next room. Avery removed plaster off the fireplaces, replaced the wide floor boards and replicated the wainscotting. Upon Amos Avery's death in July 1998, aged 96, the house passed to his oldest son Edward. Many historical artifacts were put up for auction, including 12 wicker baskets of Mohegan or Pequot origin, which were bid on by the Mashantucket Pequot Museum.|$|E
2500|$|Work on the seventh-floor Cryptic Masonry {{room was}} {{well under way}} by late 1957 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> {{dedicated}} on February 12, 1958. A change was made to the portico as well that year. [...] The portico had been designed so that large bronze plaques could be installed {{on either side of}} the main doors. Fundraising for these plaques had not gone well, leaving two gaping holes in the marble walls. The memorial association decided that marble, rather than bronze, plaques be installed in these spaces. Quotations from George Washington's Masonic correspondence were selected and inscribed on these marble plaques. Additionally, the bronze doors for both sets of elevators were also installed (at a cost of $18,000). At the end of the year, the memorial association spent more than $108,000 to finish the granite facing of the auditorium.|$|E
2500|$|In 1846 Nicholson began showing poses plastiques, {{a form of}} tableau vivant, at Garrick's Head and Town Hotel. The acts, {{which later}} became a common form of {{entertainment}} in London, featured models reenacting a work of art. Nicholson {{claimed to have been}} the first person in London to host such an event. The performances were typically scheduled for the early evening, and after performances in the local theatres concluded. At Nicholson's hotel, the models often stood on a revolving stage that overlooked the audience. The stage was illuminated by blue lights, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> covered in mirrors. Nicholson stood near the models as they posed and delivered a lecture on art to the audience, most of whom drank and smoked cigars during the performance. He advertised the events as [...] "representing Pictures from the Manchester Art Galleries and scenes from all the Principal Tragedies, Dramas, Operas". The women were purported to be a musical group known as the [...] "Female American Serenaders". Many of the titles of the acts suggested that nudity would be on display, such as [...] "The Sultan's Favourite returning from the bath" [...] or [...] "Cupid and Psyche". One of the few existing depictions of an event shows two women onstage, unclothed except for a loose skirt below the waist of one, and a sash wrapped between the legs and over the shoulder of the other.|$|E

60|$|Janoo {{pulled me}} over to the shadow in the recess of the carved bow-windows. The boards <b>were</b> up, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> only lit by one tiny lamp. There was no chance of my being seen if I stayed still.|$|R
60|$|Howbeit, {{they come}} at last into the hall, where a lamp is burning, and so into Mr. Tulkinghorn's usual room--the {{room where he}} drank his old wine to-night.

60|$|Two hours stole over me.
