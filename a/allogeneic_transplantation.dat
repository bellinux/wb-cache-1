5000|$|There {{are three}} types of HSCT: syngeneic, autologous, and {{allogeneic}} transplants. [...] Syngeneic transplantations occur between identical twins.

To lower the risks of transplant, which include graft rejection and Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), allogeneic HSCT must satisfy compatibility at the HLA loci (i.e. genetic matching to reduce the immunogenicity of the transplant).

40|$|Allogeneic stem-cell {{transplantation}} {{for multiple}} myeloma has been performed since 1983 (1).

40|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} {{is a highly}} specialized and unique medical procedure. Autologous transplantation allows the administration of high-dose chemotherapy without prolonged bone marrow aplasia. In <b>allogeneic</b> <b>transplantation,</b> donor-derived stem cells provide alloimmunity that enables a graft-versus-tumor effect to eradicate residual disease and prevent relapse. The first <b>allogeneic</b> <b>transplantation</b> was performed by E. Donnall Thomas in 1957. Since then the field has evolved and expanded worldwide. New indications beside acute leukemia and aplastic anemia have been constantly explored and now include congenital disorders of the hematopoietic system, metabolic disorders, and autoimmune disease. The use of matched unrelated donors, umbilical cord blood units, and partially matched related donors has dramatically extended the availability of <b>allogeneic</b> <b>transplantation.</b> Transplant-related mortality has decreased due to improved supportive care, including better strategies to prevent severe infections and with the incorporation of reduced-intensity conditioning protocols that lowered the toxicity and allowed for transplantation in older patients. However, disease relapse and graft-versus-host disease remain the two major causes of mortality with unsatisfactory progress. Intense research aiming to improve adoptive immunotherapy and increase graft-versus-leukemia response while decreasing graft-versus-host response might bring the next breakthrough in <b>allogeneic</b> <b>transplantation.</b> Strategies of graft manipulation, tumor-associated antigen vaccinations, monoclonal antibodies, and adoptive cellular immunotherapy have already proved clinically efficient.

The main indications for HCT were hematologic malignancies (84 %, n =  82). Ninety percent (n =  87) received myeloablative conditioning. Thirty-one percent were admitted (autologous transplant recipients 15 %, allogeneic transplant recipients 34 %, and umbilical cord blood [UCB] transplant recipients 48 %) with an average length of stay of 19  days (range, 1 to 73  days).

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} <b>Allogeneic</b> hematopoietic cell <b>transplantation</b> with {{myeloablative}} conditioning {{is a well}} established therapy for patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Its efficacy depends, in part, on the destruction of recipient acute myeloid leukemia cells by the conditioning regimen and, in part on their removal by donor immune cells contained in the graft (graft-versus-tumor effect). Due to regiment related toxicities, the use of myeloablative <b>allogeneic</b> hematopoietic cell <b>transplantation</b> has been restricted to younger patients in good condition. More recently, the introduction of <b>allogeneic</b> hematopoietic cell <b>transplantation</b> following reduced-intensity or nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens, which rely mainly on graft-versus-tumor effects for tumor cell eradication, has permitted extending hematopoietic cell transplantation to include older patients and those with medical comorbidities. Recent findings Early results with <b>allogeneic</b> hematopoietic cell <b>transplantation</b> after nonmyeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning for patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission are encouraging, with 2 -year survivals after hematopoietic cell transplantation ranging from 48 to 79 % among studies.
