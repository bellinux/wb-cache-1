5|$|The {{popularity}} of Angry Birds has helped spread {{the game to}} other devices that were not initially designed as gaming machines. Barnes & Noble announced that a future update for its Nook Color e-reader will let the Android-based device run applications, including a port of Angry Birds. In June 2011, Rovio announced plans to partner with Roku to include a version of Angry Birds on <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> its Internet-connected set-top box, the Roku 2 XS.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, Karelian Trains, a {{joint venture}} by VR and RZhD, started a new service linking Helsinki to St. Petersburg, Russia using <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the Pendolino called the Sm6 Allegro. The Sm6 is {{technically}} based on the Pendolino Nuovo, but its looks {{are similar to the}} Sm3. The most significant difference is that an Sm6 unit is composed of seven carriages. The train is capable of dual-voltage running due to differences between the electric systems of the Finnish and Russian rail network and is equipped with four pantographs.|$|E
5|$|James Fleming {{has written}} {{about the use of}} the postmodern {{tradition}} in 1602, and how this is employed; as a means to respond to the post-9/11 world in which the comic was written; and to propose <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> postmodernism better suited to the post-9/11 world. On the one hand, 1602 is clearly postmodern, depending as it does on the mixing of tropes of both Elizabethan fiction and contemporary comics. But Fleming focuses particularly on Gaiman's use of The Watcher as a witness that provides an epistemological grounding to the text - a grounding that, citing Brian McHale, Fleming argues is absent in traditional postmodern writing.|$|E

5|$|On September 12, 2013, NASA officially {{confirmed}} that Voyager 1 {{had reached the}} interstellar medium in August 2012 as previously observed, with a generally accepted date of August 25, 2012, the date durable changes in the density of energetic particles were first detected. By this point most space scientists had abandoned the hypothesis that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany crossing of the heliopause; <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the heliopause predicted that no such change would be found. A key finding that persuaded many scientists that the heliopause had been crossed was an indirect measurement of an 80-fold increase in electron density, based on the frequency of plasma oscillations observed beginning on April 9, 2013, triggered by a solar outburst that had occurred in March 2012 (electron density {{is expected to be}} two orders of magnitude higher outside the heliopause than within). Weaker sets of oscillations measured in October and November 2012 provided additional data. An indirect measurement was required because Voyager 1s plasma spectrometer had stopped working in 1980. In September 2013, NASA released audio renditions of these plasma waves. The recordings represent the first sounds to be captured in interstellar space.|$|E

25|$|Experience of Vampire {{operation}} in tropical climates {{led to the}} development of new models featuring refrigeration equipment for pilot comfort and increasingly powerful models of the Goblin engine, to counter the degradation of performance in hot conditions.
