40|$|AbstractThis study {{attempts}} {{to explore the}} process of professional development of RODACIE (Romanian Danish Center for Integrated Education) team. Set up in 2012 as an innovative centre for early education in Bucharest, RODACIE grounds on both Romanian and Danish values and quality education trends. RODACIE also represents a professional development laboratory, nurtured by the involvement of experts and trainers from both countries. The paper discusses material from ongoing action-research project in which the authors are involved. It gives voice to practitioners, inspired and challenged by multiple and sometimes conflicting practices. Practices are shaped by cultural differences and various understanding of development and care, health and nutrition, freedom and guidance, nurture and culture, body and mind, autonomy and discipline, competition and cooperation, etc. From a professional development perspective, the seven members of the staff are in an unique condition. They are simultaneously exposed to RODACIE on-the-job-training and they are enrolled as students in the Early Education Master degree program at the University of Bucharest. The coordinator of the center and seven early education practitioners have different professional backgrounds and age ranging from 28 to 50 years old. Their double exposure represents a complex and challenging opportunity to reflect on from different perspectives. Data collected (since October 2012) by weekly site observations, monthly photo analysis, focus groups and individual interviews, policy documents and critical incidents analysis provide rich insights. At one hand, subjects reflect on their own professional development and critically compare the types of learning experiences (gained by {{on the job training}} and by attending the master degree academic program). <b>At</b> <b>another</b> <b>hand,</b> mature reflective practitioners focus on their double affiliation (to RODACIE project learning community and the academic community as master students) and provide rich ideas on how universities can improve their provisions on adult and continuing education...|$|E

Participants received EMLA cream {{at one side}} dorsum of hand and lidocaine tape <b>at</b> <b>another</b> dorsum of <b>hand</b> before entering operation room. Local anesthetics were strictly applied according to their manufacturers’ instruments, respectively. In the EL group, participants received venipuncture at EMLA cream site firstly. In LE group, participants, conversely, received venipuncture at lidocaine tape site firstly. Before anesthetic induction, local anesthetics were removed followed by venous cannulations. After cannulation, participants evaluated the pain by visual analog scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale (VRS).The primary outcome was VAS, and the secondary outcome was VRS.|$|R

50|$|Military {{aviation}} {{appeared in}} World War I where aircraft were initially used to spot enemy troop concentrations, field gun positions and movements. Early aerial combat consisted of aviators shooting <b>at</b> one <b>another</b> with <b>hand</b> held weapons. The first recorded aircraft {{to be shot}} down by another aircraft, which occurred on October 5, 1914, was a German Aviatik. The pilot, Feldwebel Wilhelm Schlichting, was shot with a carbine wielded by observer Louis Quenault, who was riding in a Voisin Type 3 piloted by French Sergeant Joseph Frantz.The need to stop reconnaissance that was being conducted by enemy aircraft rapidly {{led to the development}} of fighter planes, a class of aircraft designed specifically to destroy other aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Ambling {{horses are}} now {{uncommon}} in Europe. They were effectively replaced by trotting horses for several reasons: The first was that as roads improved, travel by carriage became more common, and trotting horse breeds were generally larger and stronger, {{more suited to}} the job <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>Another</b> reason was {{the rise of the}} Thoroughbred and other breeds developed for horse racing and for light cavalry, both of which required horses able to gallop for substantial periods of time. Breeds swift at the gallop also tend to trot rather than pace or amble. In the Americas, ambling horses continued to be bred, both in the southern United States and in Latin America.|$|R

Laurent Ruquier likewise noted that he invited François Asselineau to On n'est pas couché because of incessant Twitter pressure. After the broadcast of this program, an article on the collaborative website of L'Obs (Le Plus) expressed doubts about the granting of speaking time to [...] "this kind of conspiracist", while [...] suggested that Laurent Ruquier had in fact invited Asselineau in order to ridicule his anti-European ideas.|$|R
60|$|You have read, no doubt, {{of their}} discovering, {{a year or}} two since, in making an {{excavation}} in a Pompeian street, the molds of four human bodies, three women and a man, who fell down, blind and writhing, in the storm of fire eighteen hundred years ago; whose shape the settling and hardening ashes took; whose flesh wasted away, and whose bones lay there in the hollow of the matrix till the cunning of this time found them, and, pouring liquid plaster round the skeletons, clothed them with human form again, and drew them forth into the world once more. There are many things in Pompeii which bring back the gay life of the city, but nothing which so vividly reports the terrible manner of her death as these effigies of the creatures that actually shared it. The man in the last struggle has thrown himself upon his back and taken his doom sturdily--there is a sublime calm in his rigid figure. The women lie upon their faces, their limbs tossed and distorted, their drapery tangled and heaped about them, and in every fibre you see how hard they died. One presses her face into her handkerchief to draw one last breath unmixed with scalding steam; another's arms are wildly thrown abroad to clutch <b>at</b> help; <b>another's</b> <b>hand</b> is appealingly raised, and on her slight fingers you see the silver hoops with which her poor dead vanity adorned them.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 and 21 April 1915 the 1st Battalion was {{in action}} on Hill 60 near Ypres. Second Lieutenant Geary led his men across exposed open ground swept by fierce enemy fire to join {{survivors}} of the Bedfordshire Regiment in a crater {{at the top of}} the hill. Geary's subsequent actions earned him the VC. The citation reads: For most conspicuous bravery and determination on [...] "Hill 60," [...] near Ypres, on April 20th and 21st, 1915, when he held the left crater with his platoon, some men of the Bedfordshire Regiment and a few reinforcements who came up during the evening and night. The crater was first exposed to very heavy artillery fire which broke down the defences, and afterwards throughout the night to repeated bomb attacks which filled it with dead and wounded. Each attack was, however, repulsed mainly owing to the splendid personal gallantry and example of Second Lieutenant Geary. At one time he used a rifle with great effect, <b>at</b> <b>another</b> threw <b>hand</b> grenades, and exposed himself with entire disregard to danger in order to see by the light of flares where the enemy were coming on. In the intervals between the attacks he spent his whole time arranging for the ammunition supply and for reinforcements. He was severely wounded just before daylight on 21st April.|$|R

2500|$|Regardless of {{the nature}} of a {{confirmed}} detection, PDPs also place considerable emphasis on the range of likely reactions from different constituencies, including the press, various religious groups, political leaders, and the general public. The differences in reactions across the range of cultural and religious boundaries would be substantial. One possible strategy for development of more comprehensive PDPs is to undertake carefully planned cross-cultural polls and other empirical studies based on analogues in the humanities and history, the social and behavioral sciences, and even science fiction to determine likely reactions. Shortly after a confirmed detection, the timely application of relevant interdisciplinary data is likely to prove invaluable in implementing the appropriate policy {{as well as in the}} delivery of educational and public relations initiatives particular to the situation <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>Another</b> potential strategy is to explore the capacity of religion as a “resource to absorb the impact of discovery and to maintain beneficial relations with ETI.” ...|$|R
40|$|In an {{endogenous}} cueing paradigm {{with central}} visual cues, observers made speeded responses to tactile targets at the hands, which were either close together or far apart, and holding either two separate objects or one common object between them. When the hands were far apart, the response time {{costs associated with}} attending to the wrong hand were reduced when attention had to be shifted along one object jointly held by both hands compared to when it was shifted over the same distance but across separate objects. Similar reductions in attentional costs were observed when the hands were placed closer together, suggesting that processing at one hand is less prioritized over that <b>at</b> <b>another</b> when the <b>hands</b> can be ''grouped'' by virtue of arising from the same spatial location or from the same object. Probes of perceived hand locations throughout the task showed that holding a common object decreased attentional separability without decreasing the perceived separation between the hands. Our findings suggest that tactile events at the hands may be represented in a spatial framework that flexibly adapts to (object-guided) attentional demands, while their relative coordinates are simultaneously preserved. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing...|$|R
