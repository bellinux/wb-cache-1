5|$|Seeing no {{alternative}} to avoid further bloodshed, the Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman decided to expel Singapore from the federation. Goh Keng Swee, who had become skeptical of merger's economic benefits for Singapore, convinced Lee Kuan Yew that the separation had to take place. UMNO and PAP representatives worked out the terms of separation in extreme secrecy in order to present the British government, in particular, with <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli.|$|E

5|$|Castillo Armas' army of 480 men was {{not large}} enough to defeat the Guatemalan military, even with U.S.-supplied aircraft. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSUCCESS called for a {{campaign}} of psychological warfare, which would present Castillo Armas' victory as <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli to the Guatemalan people, and would force Árbenz to resign. The propaganda campaign had begun well before the invasion, with the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing {{tens of thousands of}} leaflets throughout Latin America. The CIA persuaded friendly governments to screen video footage of Guatemala that supported the U.S. version of events.|$|E

5|$|By 21 July 1914, the British had {{postponed}} {{delivery of}} Reşadiye and Sultan Osman-ı Evvel as tensions flared in Europe following {{the assassination of}} Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June. This action prompted a protest by Djemal Pasha, the Ottoman naval minister, via France, {{in the hopes of}} securing the ships' delivery. A transport ship carrying crews for the two battleships departed Constantinople on 4 August, only to be recalled on 7 August after the Ottoman government was informed that the dreadnoughts would not be delivered. First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill ordered the Royal Navy to detain the two ships on 29 July and prevent Ottoman naval personnel from boarding them; two days later, British sailors boarded the ships and formally seized them. Since Britain was not yet at war, these actions were illegal; the British government nevertheless determined to present the Ottomans with <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli. On 3 August, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire informed the government that Britain had seized the ships.|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas {{was given}} {{enough money to}} recruit a small force of mercenaries from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of nearby countries. This band was called the Army of Liberation. The CIA {{established}} training camps in Nicaragua and Honduras and supplied them with weapons {{as well as several}} bombers. The U.S. signed military agreements with both those countries prior to the invasion of Guatemala, allowing it to move heavier arms freely. These preparations were only superficially covert: the CIA intended Árbenz to find out about them, as a part of its plan to convince the Guatemalan people that the overthrow of Árbenz was <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli. Additionally, the CIA made covert contact with a number of church leaders throughout the Guatemalan countryside, and persuaded them to incorporate anti-government messages into their sermons.|$|E

The IRB, however, was determined to use the Volunteers for offensive action while Britain was {{tied up in the}} First World War. Their plan was to circumvent MacNeill's command, instigating a Rising, and to get MacNeill on board once the rising was <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli.|$|E
25|$|The {{short-term}} {{effect of}} the Treaty was to prevent the sale of Māori land to anyone other than the Crown. This was intended to protect Māori from the kinds of shady land purchases which had alienated indigenous peoples {{in other parts of}} the world from their land with minimal compensation. Anticipating the Treaty, the New Zealand Company made several hasty land deals and shipped settlers from Great Britain to New Zealand, hoping the British would be forced to accept its land claims as <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli.|$|E

His purchase was in defiance of orders not to purchase vessels. However, faced with <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli, the Admiralty issued an order in February 1801 that her name be changed to Pickle.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet Union invaded Eastern Poland on September 17, {{its path}} cleared {{by the lack}} of British and French {{military}} activity against the Nazis in Western Poland. It wanted to build a cordon against German military strength west of the Soviet Union's national border. The Stalin regime went further, however, making its nonaggression pact into a de facto Friendship Pact by signing a joint statement with the Germans characterizing the partition of Poland as <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli, calling for an end to hostilities, and placing the onus for any escalation of the European conflict on the governments of Great Britain and France.|$|E
25|$|British leaders—and {{those on}} the Continent—generally {{believed}} that division of the U.S. was inevitable. Remembering their own unsuccessful attempt to keep their former American colonies in the Empire by force of arms, the British considered Union efforts to resist <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli to be unreasonable, but they also viewed Union resistance as a {{fact that they had}} to deal with. Believing the war's outcome to be predetermined, the British saw any action they could take to encourage {{the end of the war}} as a humanitarian gesture. Lyons was instructed by Russell to use his own office and any other parties who might promote a settlement of the war.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of May 25, Truscott {{received}} new orders from Clark via his Operations Officer, Brigadier General Don Brand. These were, in effect, to implement Operation Turtle and turn the main line of attack 90 degrees to the left. Most importantly, although the attack towards Valmontone and Route6 would continue, 1stArmored were to withdraw to prepare to exploit the planned breakthrough along the new line of attack leaving 3rdDivision to continue towards Valmontone with 1st Special Service Force in support. Clark informed Alexander of these developments late {{in the morning of}} May26 by which time the change of orders was <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli.|$|E

25|$|As {{initially}} {{envisioned by}} Warnecke, the site would be accessed by a circular granite walkway {{which led to}} an elliptical marble plaza. The downslope side of the elliptical plaza would be enclosed by a low wall inscribed with quotes from Kennedy's speeches. Marble steps led up from the plaza to a rectangular terrace which enclosed a rectangular plot of grass in which the graves would reside. A retaining wall formed {{the rear of the}} burial site. The eternal flame would be placed {{in the center of the}} grassy plot in a flat, triangular bronze sculpture intended to resemble a votive candle or brazier. The original design won near-universal praise. The U.S. Department of Defense formally hired Warnecke to design the approaches (although this was <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli).|$|E
25|$|In the process, further {{extensions}} {{were planned}} and in 1975 spending {{was expected to}} reach reached $1.6 billion ($7.3 billion in 2016). Faced with these soaring costs, the Government of Quebec declared a moratorium May 19, 1976 to the all-out expansion desired by Mayor Drapeau. Tenders were frozen, including those of Line 2 after Snowdon and those of Line 5 whose works were yet already underway. A struggle then ensued between the MUC and the Government of Quebec as any extension could not be done without the agreement of both parties. The Montreal Transportation Office may have {{tried to put the}} government in front of <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli by awarding large contracts to build the tunnel between Namur station and Bois-Franc just before the moratorium entry into force.|$|E
25|$|Argetoianu {{soon became}} noted for his anti-communist stance: he carried out arrests of those Socialist Party members who, during their party's {{congress}} in May 1921, supported a maximalist platform and {{voted in favor}} of aligning their Socialist-Communist faction (future Communist Party of Romania) with the Comintern, citing the latter's condemnation of Greater Romania (all those arrested were prosecuted in the Dealul Spirii Trial). Argetoianu later stated that the arrest lacked legal grounds, and indicated that he purposely gave the Socialist Gheorghe Cristescu approval to hold the congress as a means to incriminate the faction. Faced with mixed reactions inside the cabinet (Averescu hesitated, while the Minister of Justice Grigore Trancu-Iași refused to give him support), he ordered the move without his fellow ministers' prior knowledge, and thus faced them with <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli.|$|E

25|$|Germany's {{policy was}} {{to support a}} swift war to destroy Serbia that would present <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli to the world. Unlike the three earlier cases dating from 1912 when Austria had asked for German {{diplomatic}} support for a war against Serbia, {{this time it was}} felt that political conditions for such a war now existed. At this time, the German military supported the idea of an Austrian attack against Serbia as the best way of starting a general war, whereas Wilhelm believed that an Austro-Serbian war would be purely local. Austrian policy based upon pre-existing plans to destroy Serbia involved not waiting to complete judicial inquiries to strike back immediately and not to strain its credibility in the coming weeks as it would become more and more clear that Austria was not reacting to the assassination. Likewise, Germany wished to give the impression of its ignorance of Austrian intentions.|$|E
25|$|May {{asserted}} that in Paris, London and other capitals, {{there was an}} inability to believe that someone might want another world war. He wrote that, given public reluctance to contemplate another war and a need to reach consensus about Germany, the rulers of France and Britain were reticent (to take a stand against German aggression), which limited dissent {{at the cost of}} enabling assumptions that suited their convenience. In France, Édouard Daladier withheld information until the last moment, and then presented the Munich Agreement to the French cabinet as <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli in September 1938, thus avoiding discussions over whether Britain would follow France into war or if the military balance was really in Germany's favour or how significant it was. The decision for war in September 1939 and the plan devised in the winter of 1939–1940 by Daladier for war with the USSR followed the same pattern.|$|E
25|$|The plot of Cecilia {{revolves}} around the heroine, Cecilia Beverley, whose inheritance from her uncle comes with the stipulation that she find a husband who will accept her name. Beset on all sides by would-be suitors, the beautiful and intelligent Cecilia's heart is captivated by a man whose family's pride in its birth and ancestry would forbid the only son-and-heir's change of name. This young man finally persuades Cecilia, against all her good judgement, to agree to marry him secretly, so that their union – and the consequent change of name – can {{be presented to the}} family as <b>a</b> <b>fait</b> accompli. The work received praise for the mature tone of its ironic third-person narration, but was viewed as less spontaneous than her first work, and weighed down by the author's self-conscious awareness of her audience. Some critics claim to have found the narration intrusive, while some of her friends found the writing too closely modelled on Johnson's. Edmund Burke greatly admired the novel, but moderated his praise with criticism of the enormous array of characters and tangled, convoluted plots.|$|E
