Although Whitlam would have received ALP support in either division, he chose to continue standing for Werriwa and moved from Cronulla to Cabramatta. This meant even longer journeys for his older children to <b>attend</b> <b>school,</b> since neither electorate had a high school at the time, and they attended school in Sydney.|$|E

5|$|Aware of the {{inadequacy}} of bureaucracy in Austria, and wishing to improve it, Maria Theresa reformed education in 1775. In a new school system based on the Prussian one, all children of both genders from the ages of six to twelve were required to <b>attend</b> <b>school.</b> Education reform was met with hostility from many villages; Maria Theresa crushed the dissent by ordering the arrest of all those opposed. Although the idea had merit, the reforms were not as successful as {{they were expected to}} be since no funding was offered from the state; in some parts of Austria, half of the population was illiterate well into the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Hamasaki was {{initially}} a good student, earning good grades {{in junior high}} school. Eventually, she lost faith in the curriculum, thinking that the subjects taught were of no use to her.

5|$|The family's {{problems}} are compounded when Kiat Kun accidentally loses Seow Fang's only {{pair of shoes}} after taking them to be repaired.

5|$|The son of Scottish immigrants, Bain {{was born}} in Belleville, Ontario and moved {{with his family to}} Winnipeg, Manitoba, as a young child. His father, James Henderson Bain, was a horse buyer for the British {{government}} and upon his arrival in Canada lived in Montreal before moving west. His mother, Helen Miller, was a seamstress. Bain was the sixth of seven children, having four sisters and two brothers. Bain would <b>attend</b> <b>school</b> in Winnipeg, and earned a bachelor's degree from Manitoba College. He began working in 1888, aged 14, serving as a bookkeeper's apprentice for a grocery broker.|$|E
5|$|Welfare was expanded, as {{characterized}} {{by the introduction of}} non-contributory old-age pensions and payments to mothers provided their babies are taken for health checks and that their children <b>attend</b> <b>school.</b> Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices of gas and many foodstuffs were controlled, and local food producers were made to sell in the local market rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought economic stability.|$|E
5|$|When she was {{old enough}} to <b>attend</b> <b>school,</b> Razafindrahety was taken into the custody of her aunt, Queen Ranavalona II, who ensured she began {{receiving}} a private education from a London Missionary Society (LMS) teacher.

She continued her education throughout her adolescence at the Congregational School of Ambatonakanga, the Friends High School for Girls, and the LMS Girls' Central School. She was baptized as a Protestant at Ambohimanga on April 5, 1874. Her teachers consistently described her as ranking among their strongest students.|$|E
5|$|William Taylor {{was born}} October 10, 1853 in {{a log cabin}} on the Green River, about five miles from Morgantown, Kentucky. He was the first child of Sylvester and Mary G. (Moore) Taylor.

In 1874, he began teaching, specializing in mathematics, history, and politics. He taught until 1882, and later became a successful attorney, but continued to operate a farm.|$|E
5|$|With Grace's support, Carroll {{was able}} to <b>attend</b> <b>school</b> in France—at Lille and at the University of Douai—where he studied the humanities, philosophy, and civil and canon law.

According to family tradition, Carroll secured a position as clerk to William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis, an Englishman who was one of two Catholic peers in the court of James II.|$|E
5|$|Although Max insisted von Neumann <b>attend</b> <b>school</b> at {{the grade}} level {{appropriate}} to his age, {{he agreed to}} hire private tutors to give him advanced instruction in those areas {{in which he had}} displayed an aptitude. At the age of 15, he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst Gábor Szegő. On their first meeting, Szegő was so astounded with the boy's mathematical talent that he was brought to tears. Some of von Neumann's instant solutions to the problems in calculus posed by Szegő, sketched out on his father's stationery, are still on display at the von Neumann archive in Budapest. By the age of 19, von Neumann had published two major mathematical papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, which superseded Georg Cantor's definition. At the conclusion of his education at the gymnasium, von Neumann sat for and won the Eötvös Prize, a national prize for mathematics.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to <b>attend</b> <b>school,</b> while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|Both of the World Wars had a {{major impact}} on Stroma, which was only a dozen miles from the Royal Navy's chief base at Scapa Flow in Orkney. Six islanders died in each of the World Wars; the names of all twelve are inscribed on the island's war memorial, and during the Second World War as much as a quarter of the {{population}} was on war service. Adding to the island's economic problems, the introduction of the 11-plus exam in 1944 meant that all children over the age of 12 had to leave Stroma to complete their education at the secondary school in Wick. Because they could not commute between the island and Wick, they had to <b>attend</b> <b>school</b> as boarders, which incurred additional expenses for their parents.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge began reforms {{immediately}} and zealously. He secured the General Assembly's {{passage of a}} two-cent property tax for education. The tax was subject to voter approval, and Breckinridge worked hard to publicize the issue. His efforts paid off, as the tax passed by almost a two-to-one margin. Continuing to publicize needs and push legislators to action, Breckinridge enjoyed the support of {{five of the six}} governors under whom he served. Only John L. Helm, who opposed a state-funded school system, challenged him, but Helm's veto of a Breckinridge educational bill was overridden in the General Assembly. Breckinridge's reforms manifested tangible results. From 1847 to 1850, educational spending increased from $6,000 to $144,000. By 1850, only one out of every ten school age children did not <b>attend</b> <b>school.</b>|$|E
5|$|McLeod {{attended}} Mayesville's one-room black schoolhouse, Trinity Mission School, {{which was}} run by the Presbyterian Board of Missions of Freedmen. She was the only child in her family to <b>attend</b> <b>school,</b> so each day, she taught her family what she had learned. To get to and from school, Mary walked five miles each day. Her teacher Emma Jane Wilson became a significant mentor in her life. Wilson had attended Scotia Seminary (now Barber-Scotia College). She helped McLeod attend the same school on a scholarship, which she did from 1888–1893. The following year, she attended Dwight L. Moody's Institute for Home and Foreign Missions in Chicago (now the Moody Bible Institute), hoping to become a missionary in Africa. Told that black missionaries were not needed, she planned to teach, as education was a prime goal among African Americans.|$|E
5|$|The Elementary Education Act 1880 {{insisted on}} {{compulsory}} attendance from 5–10 years. For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, {{as it was}} more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. Attendance Officers often visited the homes of children who failed to <b>attend</b> <b>school,</b> which often proved to be ineffective. Children {{under the age of}} 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to show they had reached the educational standard; employers of these children who weren't able to show this were penalised. An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of the Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893, which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf children, who previously had no means of an official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.|$|E
