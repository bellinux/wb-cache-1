40|$|Abstract—In {{the last}} few years {{scalable}} video coding emerged as a promising technology for efficient distribution of videos through heterogeneous networks. In a heterogeneous environ-ment, the video content needs to be adapted in order to meet different end terminal capability requirements (user adaptation) or fluctuations of the available bandwidth (network adaptation).

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, wide-area {{distributed}} computing {{has emerged as}} a powerful computing paradigm. However, developing applications to execute over the wide-area has remained a challenge, primarily due to issues involved in providing automatic, dynamic and run-time adaptation. A virtual execution environment consisting of virtual machines (VMs) interconnected with virtual networks provides opportunities to dynamically optimize, at run-time, the performance of existing, unmodified distributed applications without any user or programmer intervention. Along with resource monitoring, inference and application-independent adaptation mechanisms, efficient adaptation algorithms are key to the success of such an effort. In this paper we formalize the <b>adaptation</b> <b>problem</b> in virtual execution environments. We show that this <b>adaptation</b> <b>problem</b> is NP-hard. Further, we characterize the <b>adaptation</b> <b>problem’s</b> hardness of approximation and show that it is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of m 1 / 2 −δ for any δ> 0, where m is the number of edges in the virtual overlay graph.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel method for {{adaptation}} of a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP ANN). Nowadays, the adaptation of the ANN is usually done as an incremental retraining either of a subset or the complete set of the ANN parameters. However, since sometimes {{the amount of the}} adaptation data is quite small, there is a fundamental drawback of such approach – during retraining, the network parameters can be easily overfitted to the new data. There certainly are techniques that can help overcome this problem (earlystopping, cross-validation), however application of such techniques leads to more complex and possibly more data hungry training procedure. The proposed method approaches the problem from a different perspective. We use the fact that in many cases we have an additional knowledge about the problem. Such additional knowledge can be used to limit the dimensionality of the <b>adaptation</b> <b>problem.</b> We applied the proposed method on speaker adaptation of a phoneme recognizer based on traps (Temporal Patterns) parameters. We exploited the fact that the employed traps parameters are constructed using log-outputs of mel-filter bank and by virtue of reformulating the first layer weight matrix <b>adaptation</b> <b>problem</b> as a mel-filter bank output <b>adaptation</b> <b>problem,</b> we were able to significantly limit the number of free variables.

The instrument used is “The Michigan International Student Problem Inventory” (MISPI) {{which is used to}} measure the <b>adaptation</b> <b>problem</b> among students. The statistical analysis comprising of t-test and correlation coefficient are used to test the hypotheses at a significant level of p<. 05.

The ability of using different sampling rates in control systems provides the flexibility for adapting their resource needs based on the dynamic networking environment.

In particular, we define a utility function which quantifies the relationship between the performance of a control system and its sampling rate. Then we formulate the rate <b>adaptation</b> <b>problem</b> as an optimal resource allocation problem, where the aggregated utility is maximized. We further present a price-based algorithm, where prices are generated to reflect the network utilization penalties and are used as the basis for rate adaptation. We formally prove the stability of our algorithm. The rate adaptation algorithm is further evaluated in an integrated simulation environment that consists of Matlab and ns- 2, which allows highly accurate evaluation of network effects on the NCS performance.
