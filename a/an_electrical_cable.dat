25|$|This uses {{low-voltage}} {{electricity to}} transmit {{the action of}} the organ keys to the pipes. Earlier church instruments used a mechanical linkage of rods and wires to connect the keys to the pipes. With the new system, the console (also known as a key-desk) could be placed at virtually any distance from the organ's pipes and could be somewhat portable, as just <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>cable</b> and flexible wind line connected the console with other parts of the instrument. This also allowed the console to achieve its ubiquitous place—on an elevator platform in front of the stage, low in the orchestra pit for accompanying the film, and rising majestically to stage height for organ solos.|$|E
500|$|From 1930 to 1934, Beebe and Barton {{used the}} Bathysphere {{to conduct a}} series of dives of {{increasing}} depth {{off the coast of}} Nonsuch Island, becoming the first people to observe deep-sea animals in their native environment. The Bathysphere was lowered into the ocean using a steel cable, and a second cable carried a phone line which the Bathysphere's occupants used to communicate with the surface, as well as <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>cable</b> for a searchlight to illuminate animals outside the Bathysphere. Beebe's observations were relayed up the phone line to be recorded by Gloria Hollister, his chief technical associate who was also in charge of preparing specimens obtained from dredging. Beebe and Barton made a total of 35 dives in the Bathysphere, setting several consecutive world records for the deepest dive ever performed by a human. The record set by the deepest of these, to a depth of [...] on August 15, 1934, lasted until it was broken by Barton in 1949.|$|E

500|$|At {{their mutual}} execution, David tries to taunt his son into {{transforming}} into the Hulk, but fails. He then decides to [...] "go first" [...] and bites <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>cable,</b> absorbing all the electricity in San Francisco. The electricity hits Bruce, triggering his own transformation. A brutal fight ensues between David and the Hulk, with David absorbing the Hulk's energy. It proves {{too much for}} David to handle, but when he himself transforms into a massive creature, he is killed by an Army missile. One year later, Bruce is presumed dead, while General Ross mentions apparent Hulk sightings and Betty admits her love for Bruce. In a South American jungle, Bruce has become a doctor and is approached by rebel militants {{who want to take}} medical supplies from the poor. Bruce faces the militants' leader, warning him that, [...] "You wouldn't like me when I'm angry." [...] His eyes turn green and the roar of the Hulk is heard from the distance.|$|E
500|$|The chase scene {{involving}} Joseph and Olivia required much preparation, as {{the crew}} had to simulate an exploding transformer. Special effects coordinator Conrad Brink used a [...] "mechanical trip" [...] to support <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>cable,</b> which he then strung {{to the other side}} of the adjacent road using a pole. The crew filled the fuse box with [...] "sparking devices", meant to give the appearance of an exploding transformer and power lines. Demonstrating this, Brink noted, [...] "What happens is the panel cover will blow off, sparks will come out, the cable will go up, sparking down to the ground." [...] Misiano said of the sequence, [...] "This young man runs by an electrical box and it blows up. It really blew!" [...] The director added that guest actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach later told him, [...] "that was actually really scary" [...] to film. After he filmed his character hitting Joseph with a crow bar, actor Joshua Jackson joked, [...] "Finally I'm going to get a little respect on this set." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the bombings, {{police found}} 16 other bombs in Tanweer's car, {{several of them}} {{so-called}} [...] "initiators" [...] for the rucksack bombs: plastic bottles turned into nail bombs, containing a detonator attached to <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>cable.</b> Felt-roofing nails were fixed {{to the outside of}} the bottles with their tips pointing outwards, apparently intended to cause maximum soft-tissue damage. The devices would then have had cakes of high explosive packed around them.|$|E

50|$|The term telegraphy, {{although}} {{best known}} {{in relation to}} the electric telegraph, relates to the sending of messages over long-distances. Wireless telegraphy is differentiated from electrical telegraphy in that the messages are transmitted via electromagnetic means (light or radio) rather than via <b>a</b> physical <b>electrical</b> <b>cable</b> connection.|$|R
2500|$|Sources vary on Hitchcock's {{performance}} in school. Gene Adair reports that by [...] "most accounts, Alfred {{was only an}} average, or slightly above-average, student", although McGilligan writes that Hitchcock [...] "certainly" [...] excelled academically. When Hitchcock was 15, his father died. In that same year, he left St. Ignatius to study at the London County Council School of Engineering and Navigation in Poplar, London. After leaving, he became a draftsman and advertising designer with <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>cable</b> company called Henley's.|$|E
2500|$|Loudspeakers with {{integrated}} CobraNet {{help keep}} the signal chain digital for an even longer span. [...] In a typical unpowered speaker application, the amplifier would be housed {{far away from the}} speaker, and a long speaker cable (analog) would be run between the speaker and the amplifier. The speaker cable would be subject to interference and signal loss from electrical resistance. However, a powered speaker, powered by <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>cable</b> and fitted with integrated CobraNet inputs, eliminates the speaker cable and replaces it with a network cable. Since a speaker will only use one audio channel out of the bundle, many speakers with CobraNet will also have a number of analog outputs {{for the rest of the}} channels in the bundle, which is useful in speaker cluster applications.|$|E
2500|$|For several reasons, a {{different}} landing system {{was chosen for}} MSL compared to previous Mars landers and rovers. Curiosity was considered too heavy to use the airbag landing system as used on the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rovers. A legged lander approach would have caused several design problems. It would have needed to have engines high enough above the ground when landing not to form a dust cloud that could damage the rover's instruments. This would have required long landing legs that would need to have significant width to keep {{the center of gravity}} low. A legged lander would have also required ramps so the rover could drive down to the surface, which would have incurred extra risk to the mission on the chance rocks or tilt would prevent Curiosity from being able to drive off the lander successfully. Faced with these challenges, the MSL engineers came up with a novel alternative solution: the sky crane. The sky crane system lowered the rover with a [...] tether to a soft landing—wheels down—on the surface of Mars. This system consists of a bridle lowering the rover on three nylon tethers and <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>cable</b> carrying information and power between the descent stage and rover. As the support and data cables unreeled, the rover's six motorized wheels snapped into position. At roughly [...] below the descent stage the sky crane system slowed to a halt and the rover touched down. After the rover touched down, it waited two seconds to confirm that it was on solid ground by detecting the weight on the wheels and fired several pyros (small explosive devices) activating cable cutters on the bridle and umbilical cords to free itself from the descent stage. The descent stage flew away to a crash landing [...] away. The sky crane concept had never been used in missions before.|$|E

50|$|A {{clamp meter}} {{measures}} the vector {{sum of the}} currents flowing in all the conductors passing through the probe, which depends on the phase relationship of the currents. Only one conductor is normally passed through the probe. In particular if the clamp is closed around a two-conductor cable carrying power to equipment, the same current flows down one conductor and up the other; the meter correctly reads a net current of zero. <b>As</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>cables</b> for equipment have both insulated conductors (and possibly an earth wire) bonded together, clamp meters are often used with what is essentially a short extension cord with the two conductors separated, so that the clamp can be placed around only one conductor of this extension.|$|R

50|$|Famous British {{computer}} scientist Dr. Dick Newell worked {{there on a}} file-based macro language driven 3D plant design system called PDMS (Plant Design Management System). Together with colleague Tom Sancha he left the CADCentre in 1977 to form a company called Cambridge Interactive Systems or CIS and primarily concentrated on 2D CAD. CIS had developed <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>cabling</b> solution initially called CABLOS, which was first purchased by Dowty Engineering in about 1979. Another early adopter was BMW, which used the system for car wiring diagrams. CABLOS soon became known and sold as the MEDUSA drafting system under CIS. The proprietary programming language with which MEDUSA version 1 was developed was known as baCIS 1. Around this time, the company also began developing its own 3D modelling kernel for MEDUSA.|$|R
