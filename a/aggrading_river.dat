40|$|In {{the area}} between Montfoort (province of Utrecht) and Zevenhuizen (province of South- Holland) in the Netherlands, four {{instances}} of deep depressions in the Weichselian terrace level were investigated. It was suspected that these depressions were the remnants of early Holocene (10. 150 – 6000 BP) incised rivers in the area. Old and new corings were investigated in terms of lithology {{and a number of}} cores was analysed by loss-on-ignition and palaeobotany to gain insight in the geographical spread, way of forming and age of the depressions. On three locations it was determined that the present depressions represented residual channels of early Holocene incised riviers. The channels are mostly filled with clastics, probably because of the activity of younger <b>aggrading</b> <b>rivers.</b> On the research location of Haastrecht it was determined that the present depression represents a residual channel of Weichselian age, which was filled with organic deposits in the Early Holocene...|$|R
50|$|A curious {{deposit of}} an impalpably fine and unstratified silt, {{known by the}} German name bess (or loess), lies on the older drift sheets near the larger river courses of the upper Mississippi basin. It attains a {{thickness}} of 20 ft (6 m) or more near the rivers and gradually fades away {{at a distance of}} ten or more miles (16 or more km) on either side. It contains land shells, and hence cannot be attributed to marine or lacustrine submergence. The best explanation is that, during certain phases of the glacial period, it was carried as dust by the winds from the flood plains of <b>aggrading</b> <b>rivers,</b> and slowly deposited on the neighboring grass-covered plains. The glacial and eolian origin of this sediment is evidenced by the angularity of its grains (a bank of it will stand without slumping for years), whereas, if it had been transported significantly by water, the grains would have been rounded and polished. Loess is parent material for an extremely fertile, but droughty soil.|$|R
30|$|Slopes were {{particularly}} affected by intense gullying, notably on muddy terrains. Sediment transport in small headwaters increased, and sediment waves travelled downstream {{to the large}} piedmont rivers. During the 19 th century, most of the rivers draining this region were <b>aggrading</b> braided <b>rivers</b> with a high sediment load sourced from hillslope erosion (Bravard and Peiry, 1993). Local populations were exposed to an increased flooding risk in valley floors, subsequent to the aggradation of river channels. Small villages and agricultural lands established on alluvial fans were frequently inundated by debris-flows.|$|R
40|$|Alluvial placer {{deposits}} may {{be divided}} into autochthonous and allochthonous ubtypes. Autochthonous placers contain large heavy mineral grains that are practically immovable by streams and thus occur adjacent to primary ore deposits. Rich "bottom " autoch-thonous placers accumulate during many stages of river development and are concen-trated {{at the base of}} the alluvium or in the crevices of its bedrock. Smaller and poorer "above-bottom " autochthonous placers are composed of grains received by rivers during the last stages of equilibrium and/or aggradation. These grains cannot get to the bed-rock, which is protected from the river action by a layer of a substrative alluvium, but mineral grains may be concentrated in the higher parts of alluvial strata. During later downcutting stages, however, above-bottom placers may be reworked to join and enlarge bottom placers. Allochthonous placers, containing finer heavy mineral grains moved by a river as a part of its alluvial load, form far downstream from primary ore deposits or autochthonous placers, and they occur in surficial parts of channel alluvium. Rivers in an equilibrium state build point-bar placers, and in <b>aggrading</b> <b>rivers</b> several point-bar concentrations may be superimposed to form thick allochthonous placers. As bottom and above-bottom autochthonous placers, and allochthonous placers, require different methods for locating, prospecting, and sampling, the recognition of these types is of a practical importance...|$|R
50|$|The {{central section}} of the Great Plains, between latitudes 42° and 36°, occupying eastern Colorado and western Kansas, is, briefly stated, {{for the most part}} a {{dissected}} fluviatile plain. That is, this section was once smoothly covered with a gently sloping plain of gravel and sand that had been spread far forward on a broad denuded area as a piedmont deposit by the rivers which issued from the mountains. Since then, it has been more or less dissected by the erosion of valleys. The central {{section of the}} plains thus presents a marked contrast to the northern section. For while the northern section owes its smoothness to the removal of local gravels and sands from a formerly uneven surface by the action of degrading rivers and their inflowing tributaries, the southern section owes its smoothness to the deposition of imported gravels and sands upon a previously uneven surface by the action of <b>aggrading</b> <b>rivers</b> and their outgoing distributaries. The two sections are also like in that residual eminences still here and there surmount the peneplain of the northern section, while the fluviatile plain of the central section completely buried the pre-existent relief. Exception to this statement must be made in the south-west, close to the mountains in southern Colorado, where some lava-capped mesas (Mesa de Maya, Raton Mesa) stand several thousand feet above the general plain level, and thus testify to the widespread erosion of this region before it was aggraded.|$|R
40|$|The {{interplay between}} {{sediment}} supply (Ss), sedimentation rate (Sr), {{and the frequency}} of channel avulsion (Af) exerts a primary control on alluvial architecture. In order to investigate the effect of sediment supply on avulsion frequency, four Froude-scale model experiments of an <b>aggrading</b> braided <b>river</b> were undertaken in which the magnitude of Ss was progressively increased over an eightfold range. The value of A f increases at a rate slower than the increase in S s, contrary to the trend previously reported by Bryant, Falk, and Paola in their experimental study on alluvial-fan dynamics. These results suggest that the relationship between A f and S s is dependent upon bed slope and that the response of A f to an increase in S s in unconfined braided rivers may be different than that on steep alluvial fans...|$|R
30|$|A {{recent study}} of the {{sedimentation}} in a palaeo-lake located in the Upper Drôme catchment revealed an erosion rate of 1850 t km 2 yr– 1 between 1442 and 1795 for a drainage basin of 187 km 2 (Buoncristiani et al., 2002). This value is one to two orders of magnitude higher than present-day erosion rates derived from alpine lakes with comparable drainage basins in the French Alps. This {{can be linked to}} the post-Little Ice Age warming, but also to the considerable land use changes that occurred in the Alps during the last 150 years. Today, although erosion is still active locally, a dense forest cover has now established on the slopes as a result of reforestation and associated bioengineering works (Demontzey, 1880) and rural depopulation (Piégay et al., 2004; Liébault et al., 2005). Subsequently, some <b>aggraded</b> braided <b>rivers</b> have progressively incised to a single-thread channel, with moderate sediment loads (Liébault and Piégay, 2002).|$|R

The rising waters submerged the Mapanuepe Valley including the barangays of Aglao (lower), Buhawen and Pili of San Marcelino, Zambales.

40|$|Multiple channel rivers {{characterized}} by vegetated or otherwise stable alluvial islands that divide flows at discharges up to bankfull are termed 2 ̆ 7 anabranching 2 ̆ 7. They {{consist of a}} diverse group ranging from low-energy with organic or fine-textured flood plains that have generally been termed anastomosing rivers, to high-energy gravel systems, or even those carved into bedrock. They are not as common as meandering or braiding rivers but occur widely from the subarctic to the tropics and from humid alpine to lowland arid regions. Furthermore, it is the dominant style among the world 2 ̆ 7 s largest alluvial rivers. Individual alluvial anabranches develop either as erosional channels scoured into flood plains or from mid-channel bars that grow progressively to form long-lived stable islands or ridges that divide the flow in previously much wider channels. They can also form from delta progradation and subsequent modification of the distributary system. Where rapid vertical accretion leads to frequent channel avulsion and abandonment, the pattern will be relatively unstable but can remain anabranching for millennia. Such <b>aggrading</b> <b>rivers</b> form thick sedimentary sequences, their instability recognizable in the rock record as vertically stacked packages of multiple channels encased in flood plains of accreting clastic and/or organic sediment. Under such conditions of sediment excess, a network of anabranching channels can relatively efficiently redistribute and store the surplus load across wide valleys or advancing deltas. Alternatively, where vertical accretion is slow or nonexistent, very stable anabranching channels can form, which {{appear to have a}} long-term advantage over other patterns. Modeling has shown that such anabranches can lead to equilibrium conditions that maintain the mass-flux balance of bedload by confining bankfull flows in transport-efficient low width/depth (w/d) ratio channels. Reduced w/d ratios formed by the introduction of islands enhance bed shear and move sediment over gradients that would otherwise be insufficient. By contrast, in underloaded systems, modeling has shown that anabranching can consume surplus energy by generating greater skin resistance with the addition of channels. On relatively small rivers, vegetation appears to be essential for maintaining the bank strength necessary for anabranching. By contrast, on very large rivers where banks are high and stage varies greatly, vegetation probably has limited or even no effect, and anabranching is probably linked to keeping w/d ratios in a range optimal for sediment transport as discharge increases. Along with meandering and braiding, anabranching provides yet another mechanism facilitating self-adjustment in alluvial rivers...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Discontinuity-bounded late Quaternary {{sequences}} in {{the southern}} Gangetic Plains (Himalayan Foreland Basin) reflect flood-plain aggradation and degradation in response to forcing by the pow-erful Southwest Indian Monsoon. The major Himalayan and cratonic rivers in this area occupy narrow, incised valleys and do not inundate the adjoining broad interfluves, which display soil development, small plains-fed rivers, lakes, eolian deposits, and badland ravines. However, these areas formerly experienced active alluviation because thick flood-plain muds underlie the interfluve. An age model suggests that inter-fluve areas near the major <b>rivers</b> <b>aggraded</b> periodically between about 27 ka and 90 ka (Marine Oxygen Isotope Stages 3 – 5).

40|$|Generic {{models of}} continental-margin {{evolution}} predict that siliciclastic fluxes to slopes should be maximal and minimal during major sea-level lowstands and transgressions, respectively. Here we document the opposite for the northeast Australian margin, the largest extant mixed siliciclastic-carbonate depositional system. Cores from slopes of this margin consistently contain siliciclastic-rich intervals, ~ 0. 3 – 1 m thick, {{in the upper}} few meters. Radiocarbon dates of planktonic foraminifera show that this interval was deposited between 12 and 7 ka and represents greatly increased siliciclastic fluxes during late transgression. This massive terrigenous discharge to slopes occurred along at least 450 km of the margin, irrespective of modern variations in bathymetry or climate. Although we cannot dismiss a significantly different early Holocene climate with greatly enhanced sediment discharge, available data instead suggest that <b>rivers</b> <b>aggraded</b> on the shelf during lowstand because of an extensive subaerially exposed reef system. This phenomenon may occur on other margins rimmed by reefs, requiring a major revision of concepts used to interpret mixed siliciclastic-carbonate systems...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{modelling}} of the braided Ashburton River, Canterbury Plains, New Zealand, {{has allowed}} {{investigation of the}} relationship between the frequency of channel avulsion (Af), the duration of time that the braidplain is occupied by flow, the spatial pattern of braidplain sedimentation and how these respond to a change in sediment supply (Ss). Model results demonstrate a strong, positive relationship between Ss and Af and that there is no downstream change in Af over the short braidplain distances (100 m) modelled herein. Although Af is strongly dependent on Ss, the degree of channel switching does not influence the rate, or spatial pattern, of braidplain sedimentation. All experiments used a single, central input for water and sediment, and the channels occupied the centre of the alluvial basin for a longer period of time than the margins for all sediment supply rates and distances downstream. Despite this spatio-temporal pattern in flow occupancy, braidplain sedimentation rates were nearly uniform both downstream and across the basin, and increased at approximately the same rate as increases in Ss. Consequently, less frequent, and possibly short-lived, flows at the braidplain margins deposited and preserved more sediment per unit time than at the centre of the basin where flow occupancy was higher. An approximate order of magnitude change in sediment supply resulted in only a factor of two change in bed slope, probably due to an increase in channelization and sediment throughput. This result suggests that linear diffusion models are unlikely to be applicable in <b>aggrading</b> multi-thread <b>rivers.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{indicate}} that aggradation of a river channel is caused by upriver and/or downriver controls, but the evaluation of their relative importance is often difficult. A method is proposed to isolate {{the effect of the}} downriver control based on the slopes of the existing river profile, those of the graded profile estimated from the discharge-sediment relationship and slope reduction due to local base-level rise. The method was applied to the rapidly <b>aggrading</b> lower Yellow <b>River.</b> The downriver control in this case refers to the local base-level rise associated with deltaic extension during the period under discussion. The result shows that the main portion of siltation along the river is not caused by downriver control but by the slope difference between the existing and the graded profiles over a period within the last 700 years, assuming conditions of discharge and sediment load during the period from 1962 to 1985 are reflective of the long term. The marked slope difference between the existing and the graded profiles of the river is a result of changes in the river environment in the past several thousand years including the increase of sediment load, local base-level rise associated with river lengthening by deltaic growth, and relative sea-level rise due to tectonic subsidence of the coastal alluvial plain.

40|$|We {{quantified}} all {{components of}} a fluvial sediment budget for a discrete flood on an <b>aggrading</b> gravel bed <b>river.</b> Bed load transport rates were measured at the upstream and downstream ends of a 4 km study area on the Provo River, Utah, during a dam-controlled flood. We also collected high-resolution measurements of channel topography {{before and after the}} controlled flood for the entire reach. Topographic uncertainty in the digital elevation models (DEM) was characterized using a spatially variable approach. The net sediment flux provided unambiguous indication of storage. Sediment input to the reach (319 m 3) exceeded output (32 m 3), producing a net accumulation of approximately 290 m 3. The difference between the scour and fill was also positive (470 m 3), but uncertainty in the topographic differencing was larger than the observed net storage. Thus, the budget would have been indeterminate if based on morphologic data alone. Although topographic differencing was not sufficiently accurate to indicate net storage, it was able to demonstrate that internal erosion was a larger sediment source than the net sediment flux. The magnitude of total erosion (1454 m 3) and deposition (1926 m 3) was considerably larger than net change in storage, showing that internal sources and sinks were the dominant driver of channel change. The findings provide guidance for the development of sediment budgets in settings in which one must choose between a morphological approach and the direct measurement of sediment flux...|$|R
40|$|The Kirkwood Formation in the Bushman's River {{area of the}} Algoa Basin is characterised by {{a number}} of fining-upward cycles. These have been {{interpreted}} as indicating deposition in a dynamic <b>aggrading</b> meandering <b>river</b> system with the channel deposits (conglomerates grading upwards into sandstones) fining upward into the overbank deposits (mudrocks). Channel, channel-margin and overbank deposits were recognised. The three mudrock sequences logged comprise compound pedofacies sequences of multistorey, simple and cumulative palaeosols. Distinctive palaeopedological features, such as root traces and pedotubules, soil horizons and structures, mottles, and iron-rich and calcareous glaebules and calcareous hardpan lenses and layers were used to identify a number of palaeosols within the mudrock sequences. Each mudrock sequence comprises multistorey entisol, inceptisol, alfisol, ultisol, aridisol and vertisol profiles at different stags of pedogenic maturity. The entisols and inceptisols are relatively immature profiles formed close to the meandering river channel and are classified as channel-margin palaeosols. The ultisols, alfisols, aridisols and vertisols are more mature and formed at some distance from the channel. They are classified as proximal floodbasin or distal floodbasin palaeosols depending on their maturity, distance from the channel and grain-size. Slickensides, desiccation cracks, and iron-rich concretions occur, indicating multiple cycles of wetting and drying. A low water-table beneath the floodplain is indicated by both the prominent maroon-brown colouration of the mudstones, caused by oxidation during deposition, and the general lack of evaporites in the sequence. Calcretes comprising calcic and petrocalcic horizons are very common in the lower mudrock sequence, rare in the middle mudrock sequence and relatively common in the upper mudrock sequence. The calcretes generally consist a nodular zone which may, in some cases, be capped by a thin hardpan layer. The calcic palaeosols commonly show stages of carbonate accumulation which indicate at least 10 000 years of formation. The lack of calcrete formation in some of the profiles may indicate frequent flooding and high sediment accretion rates or a decrease in the influx of Ca²⁺-rich aeolian dust into the depositional basin. Clay alluviation is common in many of the profiles and soil structures are commonly well developed. The palaeosols are interpreted as having formed on an aggrading floodplain in a warm to hot (25 - 30 °C), semi-arid climate with a low but seasonal rainfall (100 - 500 mm per annum) ...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{variability}} has had {{a dramatic}} impact on eastern Grand Canyon tributaries over the past - 100 ky. This is readily observed in the Lava Chuar and Comanche catchments, which host well preserved colluvial remnants and river terraces that resulted from several climate-induced cycles of aggradation and incision. This study investigates these climate responses using surveying, sedimentology, and luminescence geochronology methods to investigate the mechanisms and timing of their deposition. The survey data demonstrate that the concavity of terrace treads is lower than modern drainages. The sedimentology suggests the prevalence of stream-flow reworking of debris flow deposits and portrays an expected down-stream fining of deposits. Results of geochronology indicate that Lava Chuar Creek aggraded from - 100 - 90 ka (S 4), 61 - 55 ka (S 3 o), 50 - 35 ka (S 3 y), and 14 - 7 ka (S 2). Comanche Creek similarly aggraded twice during the time period from 77 - 35 ka (S 3) and also from 26 - 22 ka (S 2). The response of eastern Grand Canyon tributaries to glacial-interglacial climate cycling {{appears to be more}} complicated than formerly thought. Previous conceptual models assumed that stream aggradation in arid settings occurred as a response to one specific set of climatic and biologic conditions, but new field data and luminescence dates on terrace materials reveal that {{there are at least two}} sets of conditions that were conducive to aggradation along local streams. First, streams aggraded during cooler, wetter climates, which is inferred to be due to increased sediment supply (e. g. S 4 and S 3 y in Lava Chuar). With the transition to warmer interglacial climates came higher intensity storms and decreased vegetation density in catchments, based on previous paleoclimate studies. These conditions caused remobilization and redeposition of older sediment and resulted in a second set of stream aggradation phases (e. g. S 3 o and S 2 in Lava Chuar). Meanwhile, the Colorado <b>River</b> <b>aggraded</b> only once per climate cycle during glacial advances and subsequent climate transitions. Thus, tributaries have responded more frequently and more sensitively to changing local conditions compared to the relatively insensitive Colorado River. This is supported by tighter correlation of tributary records to trends in regional paleoclimate records than to global ice records...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the sediment transported by rivers (e. g. sediment flux, grain size distribution – GSD) dictate whether <b>rivers</b> <b>aggrade</b> or erode their substrate. They also condition the architecture and properties of sedimentary successions in basins. In this study, we investigate the relationship between landscape steepness and the grain size of hillslope and fluvial sediments. The study area is located within the Feather River basin in northern California, and studied basins are underlain exclusively by tonalite lithology. Erosion rates {{in the study area}} vary over an order of magnitude, from > 250 mm ka − 1 in the Feather River canyon to < 15 mm ka − 1 on an adjacent low-relief plateau. We find that the coarseness of hillslope sediment increases with increasing hillslope steepness and erosion rates. We hypothesise that, in our soil samples, the measured 10 -fold increase in D 50 and doubling of the amount of fragments larger than 1 mm when slope increases from 0. 38 to 0. 83 m m − 1 is due to a decrease in the residence time of rock fragments, causing particles to be exposed for shorter periods of time to processes that can reduce grain size. For slopes in excess of 0. 7 m m − 1, landslides and scree cones supply much coarser sediment to rivers, with D 50 and D 84 more than one order of magnitude larger than in soils. In the tributary basins of the Feather River, a prominent break in slope developed in response to the rapid incision of the Feather River. Downstream of the break in slope, fluvial sediment grain size increases, due to an increase in flow competence (mostly driven by channel steepening) as well as a change in sediment source and in sediment dynamics: on the plateau upstream of the break in slope, rivers transport easily mobilised fine-grained sediment derived exclusively from soils. Downstream of the break in slope, mass wasting processes supply a wide range of grain sizes that rivers entrain selectively, depending on the competence of their flow. Our results also suggest that, in this study site, hillslopes respond rapidly to an increase in the rate of base-level lowering compared to rivers...|$|R
40|$|Well-preserved Holocene {{terraces}} {{along the}} South Fork Payette River in central Idaho provide {{a record of}} fluvial system behavior in a steep mountain watershed characterized by weathered and erodible Idaho Batholith granitic rocks. Terrace deposit ages were provided by 14 C dating of charcoal fragments and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of sandy sediments. Along with pairing of many terrace tread heights, these data indicate episodic downcutting during the Holocene, with a mean incision rate of 0. 9 m/ka from 7 ka to present. Prior to 7 ka, the river incised to within 3 m of current bankfull, but then aggraded by 5 m over at least a 10 km-long reach in an episode centered 7 – 6 ka. Aggradation may relate to (1) increased hillslope sediment input from landslides and debris flows in steep tributary basins with abundant grussified granitic bedrock, (2) possible local landslide-damming of the channel, (3) decreased peak discharge, or (4) {{a combination of these}} factors. Middle Holocene channel aggradation ca. 7 – 6 ka corresponds with a period of prolonged and widespread aridity in the northern Rocky Mountains. Between 5 and 1. 3 ka, the <b>river</b> <b>aggraded</b> slightly and then remained stable, forming a prominent terrace tread at 3 m above current bankfull. Modest aggradation to vertical stability of the South Fork Payette River at the 1. 5 m terrace level 1. 0 – 0. 7 ka corresponds with large fire-related debris flows in tributaries during Medieval droughts. Three intervals of incision (5. 5 – 5 ka, 1. 3 – 1. 0 ka and 0. 5 ka) correspond with frequent but small fire-related sedimentation events and generally cooler, wetter conditions suggesting increased snowmelt runoff discharges. Other possible drivers of channel incision include an increase in stochastic or climate-modulated large storms and floods and a reduction in delivery of hillslope sediment to the channel. Aggradation is more confidently tied to climate through increases in hillslope sediment delivery and (or) decreased stream power, both likely related to warmer, drier conditions (including high-severity fires) that reduce snowmelt and decrease vegetation cover on steep slopes. Thus, the Holocene terraces of the South Fork Payette River do not reflect simple stepwise incision with periods of vertical stability and lateral migration, but record substantial episodes of aggradation as well. We infer that increases in hillslope erosion and mass movements combined with reduced discharges during prolonged droughts episodically reverse the post-glacial trend of downcutting, in particular during the middle Holocene. The present bedrock-dominated channel implies a strong tendency toward incision in the late Holocene...|$|R
