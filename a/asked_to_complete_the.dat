5|$|The story {{revolves}} around fifteen-year-old pilot Claus Valca and navigator Lavie Head, who fly their vanship as sky couriers {{in the nation}} of Anatoray. Although they usually take up missions of relatively low difficulty, they are one day <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> mission of a dying courier. The mission, rated seven stars out of ten, is to deliver a young girl named Alvis Hamilton to the mysterious battleship Silvana. Despite their fears, Claus and Lavie deliver Alvis to the battleship but decide to remain aboard to keep her safe.|$|E
5|$|Below Frodsham, barges {{carrying}} salt had {{to negotiate}} a tidal section of the river to reach the Mersey, from where the cargo would be taken to Liverpool or Manchester for distribution worldwide. Water levels were inadequate for the Mersey Flats at neap tides, resulting in them having to wait for days at Frodsham. In 1796, users of the navigation suggested {{that it should be}} extended to Weston Point, where the water was deeper. The trustees wanted to pay for this extension by raising tolls, but the users objected, and it took several years to work out a deal which suited both parties. Finally, the Trustees obtained a third Act on 8 August 1807, which authorised the construction of a cut from Frodsham to Weston Point. The trustees insisted that their own engineer, John Johnson, should oversee the work, but the project was too large for him, and ran over time and budget. He was sacked in 1809, after serving the navigation for 29 years, and Thomas Telford was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> work. He managed the project with Samuel Fowls as engineer. At Weston Point, a new lock connected the cut to a basin, and tide gates connect the basin to the Mersey. This cut was called the Weston Canal and was completed in 1810. A fourth Act was obtained on 2 May 1825, which altered some of the details of the previous Act, and an Act of 22 May 1829 noted that the Weston Canal had been completed. It stated that the Trustees had built a basin, piers and a lighthouse at Weston Point, that the Weston Canal was officially a branch of the River Weaver, and that the Trustees would make no additional charges for using the section. No tolls had been collected since 1816, once the construction costs had been repaid.|$|E

When performing a word-stem completion test, patients were able to successfully complete the task when <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> stem using the first word that came to mind, but when explicitly asked to recall a word to complete the stem that was on the study list, patients performed at below-average levels.|$|E

Pilots were trained at night, over unfamiliar terrain, and forced to rely on their instruments for direction. The Ju 87's standard Revi C12D gunsight was replaced with the new Nachtrevi ("Nightrevi") C12N. On some Ju 87s, the Revi 16D was exchanged for the Nachtrevi 16D. To help the pilot see his instrument panel, a violet light was installed.|$|E
500|$|Of Offenbach's two serious operas, Die Rheinnixen, a failure, was not revived {{until the}} 21st century. His second attempt, The Tales of Hoffmann, was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} grand opera. When the work was accepted by Léon Carvalho for production at the Opéra-Comique, Offenbach agreed {{to make it an}} opéra comique with spoken dialogue. It was incomplete when he died; Faris speculates that, but for Georges Bizet's premature death, Bizet rather than Guiraud would have been <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> piece and would have done so more satisfactorily. The critic Tim Ashley writes, [...] "Stylistically, the opera reveals a remarkable amalgam of French and German influences … Weberian chorales preface Hoffmann's narrative. Olympia delivers a big coloratura aria straight out of French grand opera, while Antonia sings herself to death to music reminiscent of Schubert." ...|$|E
