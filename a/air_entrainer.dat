40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of slipforming field trials carried out to investigate the potential of polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete in reducing the need for anti-cracking conventional reinforcement in slipform construction. Three trials are reported in which polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete of different strengths ranging between 43 and 54 N mm- 2 was used to replace conventional reinforcement in normal concretes. In addition steel fibre (melt-extract) reinforced concrete of strength 60 N mm- 2 was also used in one of the trials. In order to achieve optimum mix design, use was made of pulverized fuel ash, silica fume and admixtures such as superplasticizer, retarder and <b>air</b> <b>entrainer</b> as required. The results of the field trials confirm the promising potential of fibre-reinforced concrete in eliminating the need for conventional anti-cracking reinforcement in slipform construction...|$|E
40|$|Literature often {{concludes that}} the lower {{mechanical}} properties of recycled concrete, compared to standard concrete, is unfavourable for the durability in aggressive environments. One of these aggressive environments is frost. Belgium, with a temperate maritime climate, {{is a country that}} experiences many annual frost/thaw-cycles. Before recycled concrete can be used in outside environments, more experimental research is needed. This investigation was set up to determine the resistance of concrete made with coarse recycled concrete aggregates (0 - 40 %), against these frost/thaw-cycles. In this research recycled concrete aggregates originating from mixed demolition containing mainly limestone aggregates and aggregates from road demolition, containing porphyry were used. A second parameter of this research was the influence of different concentrations of <b>air</b> <b>entrainer.</b> In total three reference concrete mixture and twelve different recycled concrete mixtures were made. All fifteen concretes mixtures were exposed to frost-thaw cycles in a 3 % NaCl solution. Beside the frost/thaw resistance tests, the hardened density, dynamic modus of elasticity and compressive strength were tested before and after 30 frost-thaw cycles. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The most {{prevalent}} method {{for the prevention}} of freeze-thaw and salt scaling damage in cement based materials is through the entrainment of air voids using air entraining chemical admixtures (AEA's). However, the common field methods for measuring air content in fresh concrete cannot distinguish between entrained and entrapped air voids, and the actual air content in the hardened concrete can vary from that determined by these tests due to a variety of factors such as workability, placing operations, consolidation efforts, and environmental conditions. Previous research has shown the ability of ultrasonic attenuation to distinguish between entrained and entrapped air voids in hardened cement paste, providing a foundation for an inversion procedure to calculate the size and volume content of the two scatterer sizes. While additional challenges are present with measurements in fresh paste, the use of an immersion setup can overcome the limitations of cement paste containment vessels and provide a means to measure air content from batching to placement. An immersion apparatus to monitor ultrasonic wave attributes including attenuation in fresh cement paste is designed and built. Results comparing air entrained and non-air entrained cement pastes are presented. Ultrasonic wave attributes are studied as a function of time and level of chemical <b>air</b> <b>entrainer.</b> Finally, recommendations are made to improve the accuracy of the immersion apparatus in order to develop an in situ, quality control procedure to quantify the air content of fresh cement paste from batching to placement.

40|$|Statistical models using {{multiple}} linear regression {{are some of the}} most widely used methods to study the influence of independent variables in a given phenomenon. This study’s objective is to understand the influence of the various components of aerogel-based renders on their thermal and mechanical performance, namely cement (three types), fly ash, aerial lime, silica sand, expanded clay, type of aerogel, expanded cork granules, expanded perlite, <b>air</b> <b>entrainers,</b> resins (two types), and rheological agent. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences), based on 85 mortar mixes produced in the laboratory and on their values of thermal conductivity and compressive strength obtained using tests in small-scale samples. The results showed that aerial lime assumes the main role in improving the thermal conductivity of the mortars. Aerogel type, fly ash, expanded perlite and <b>air</b> <b>entrainers</b> are also relevant components for a good thermal conductivity. Expanded clay can improve the mechanical behavior and aerogel has the opposite effect...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{demand for}} {{creating}} more sustainable and durable concretes {{lead to the}} increased usage of various cementitious materials and chemical admixtures in the mixtures. However, the increased usage of these components resulted in more complex mixtures that sometimes cause unexpected incompatibility problems. ^ This thesis summarizes {{the results of the}} investigation of the parameters that may lead to workability problems, early age hydration irregularities and difficulties in achieving quality air void system in both plain and fly ash cementitious mixtures. The present research work was performed in three major phases and the statistical modeling was used to aid in interpretation. ^ Phase I involved evaluation of more than 100 different paste and mortar mixtures with respect to potential slump loss and hydration irregularities. The results showed that cements with high C 3 A and low SO 3 content were more prone to incompatibility problems. It was also observed that mixes with lignin based water reducer had higher tendency for rapid stiffening than mixes with poly-carboxylate type super-plasticizer (PCSP). Increased replacement of cement by class C ashes resulted in the development of abnormal secondary peaks in semi-adiabatic calorimetry curves and accelerated the setting behavior. ^ The focus of phase II was on identifying material combinations that can result in problems related to air void generation and stability. The experiments were conducted on 18 different systems and included determination of foam drainage and foam index parameters. The results show that the amount of <b>air</b> <b>entrainers</b> required to obtain target air percentage, increased with the increase in the fly ash content in the mixture. Lignin based WR had, in general, a higher air entraining effect than the super-plasticizer when used in combination with <b>air</b> <b>entrainers.</b> Also, five out of the six mixtures with most unstable air void system, identified using the foam drainage experiments, contained the PCSP. ^ The third (and final) phase of the study involved production of 10 concrete mixtures to verify the incompatibility findings from the paste and mortar experiments performed in phases I and II. The observations from the concrete testing were in agreement with the findings from the paste and mortar testing. ^ Statistical modeling (performed using the material properties and results from phase I) identified the total C 3 A, SO 3 and Na 2 Oequ contents of the binder system along with presence of PCSP (if present in the mixture) as statistically significant in predicting the initial set time and area of spread measured at different time using the mini-slump test. ...|$|R
40|$|With {{the use of}} {{supplementary}} cementing materials (SCMs) {{in concrete}} mixtures, salt scaling tests such as ASTM C 672 {{have been found to}} be overly aggressive and do correlate well with field scaling performance. The reasons for this are thought to be because at high replacement levels, SCM mixtures can take longer to set and to develop their properties: neither of these factors is taken into account in the standard laboratory finishing and curing procedures. As a result, these variables were studied as well as a modified scaling test, based on the Quebec BNQ scaling test that had shown promise in other research. The experimental research focused on the evaluation of three scaling resistance tests, including the ASTM C 672 test with normal curing as well as an accelerated curing regime used by VDOT for ASTM C 1202 rapid chloride permeability tests and now included as an option in ASTM C 1202. As well, several variations on the proposed draft ASTM WK 9367 deicer scaling resistance test, based on the Quebec Ministry of Transportation BNQ test method, were evaluated for concretes containing varying amounts of slag cement. A total of 16 concrete mixtures were studied using both high alkali cement and low alkali cement, Grade 100 slag and Grade 120 slag with 0, 20, 35 and 50 percent slag replacement by mass of total cementing materials. Vinsol resin was used as the primary <b>air</b> <b>entrainer</b> and Micro Air® was used in two replicate mixes for comparison. Based on the results of this study, a draft alternative test method to ASTM C 762 is proposed...|$|E
40|$|The current {{operation}} strategy for using Saltstone Vault 4 to receive 0. 2 Ci/gallon salt solution waste involves pouring a clean grout layer over the radioactive grout prior to initiating pour into another cell. This will minimize the radiating surface area {{and reduce the}} dose rate at the vault and surrounding area. The Clean Cap {{will be used to}} shield about four feet of Saltstone poured into a Z-Area vault cell prior to moving to another cell. The minimum thickness of the Clean Cap layer will be determined by the cesium concentration and resulting dose levels and it is expected to be about one foot thick based on current calculations for 0. 1 Ci Saltstone that is produced in the Saltstone process by stabilization of 0. 2 Ci salt solution. This report documents experiments performed to identify a formulation for the Clean Cap. Thermal transient calculations, adiabatic temperature rise measurements, pour height, time between pour calculations and shielding calculations were beyond the scope and time limitations of this study. However, data required for shielding calculations (composition and specific gravity) are provided for shielding calculations. The approach used to design a Clean Cap formulation was to produce a slurry from the reference premix (10 / 45 / 45 weight percent cement/slag/fly ash) and domestic water that resembled as closely as possible the properties of the Saltstone slurry. In addition, options were investigated that may offer advantages such as less bleed water and less heat generation. The options with less bleed water required addition of dispersants. The options with lower heat contained more fly ash and less slag. A mix containing 10 / 45 / 45 weight percent cement/slag/fly ash with a water to premix ratio of 0. 60 is recommended for the Clean Cap. Although this mix may generate more than 3 volume percent standing water (bleed water), it has rheological, mixing and flow properties that are similar to previously processed Saltstone. The recommended Clean Cap mix generates more bleed water than the reference Saltstone formulation because the specific gravity of water, the carrier fluid, is less than that of the carrier fluid in Saltstone, 1 versus 1. 1 to 1. 2, respectively. In addition, the development of slurry structure as a result of hydration reactions is slightly slower than in the salt solution slurry. In other words, the Clean Cap mix has a slightly longer gel time. The lower density of the carrier fluid and the slower development of slurry structure, enable more settling to occur (more standing water) in the Clean Cap slurry. Consequently, for the same rheological properties, the Clean Cap slurry will have more bleed water. In an attempt to reduce the bleed water, the water to premix ratio was lowered and dispersants (high range water reducers) were added. Below water to premix ratios of 0. 35, little bleed water and settling was observed. However, a low water to premix Clean Cap mix is not recommended because processing has not been demonstrated in the Saltstone facility. The lowest water to premix ratio processed in Z-Area was 0. 478 in the last attempt to produce a clean cap. Although this option may provide significant advantages (less bleed water and potentially better flow) process testing in the Saltstone Facility or in a pilot scale facility in conjunction with laboratory testing will be required to demonstrate mixing, pumping and flow properties. Other additives were tested to minimize bleed water. These additives were found to be unsatisfactory in one or more ways and therefore, were not recommended at this time. An air entraining agent and a thickener had some benefit in reducing bleed water but were found too difficult to implement as an additive in the Saltstone facility. Surfactants (<b>air</b> <b>entrainers)</b> added to the mixing water in the hold tank could generate foam as the result of agitation to mix the tank, and the thickener increased the apparent viscosity and yield stress...|$|R
