25|$|There is much {{disagreement}} over {{the meaning of}} constipation, far overreported by the general public versus conventional medical criteria—under two defecations per week. Despite the general public's remaining prevalence of belief that maintaining good health requires defecation at least daily, many constipated individuals <b>apparently</b> <b>are</b> quite healthy—some even defecating under once a week—whereas others who defecate daily are unhealthy.|$|E
25|$|Beaufort Sea, {{the density}} of ringed seals in May–June is higher to the east than {{to the west of}} Flaxman Island. The overall winter {{distribution}} is probably similar, and it is believed there is a net movement of seals northward with the ice edge in late spring and summer. Thus, ringed seals occupying the Bering and southern Chukchi seas in winter <b>apparently</b> <b>are</b> migratory, but details of their movements are unknown.|$|E
25|$|Attachment is a two-step process. Following {{an initial}} weak and {{reversible}} attachment, the bacteria synthesize cellulose fibrils that anchor {{them to the}} wounded plant cell {{to which they were}} attracted. Four main genes are involved in this process: chvA, chvB, pscA, and att. The products of the first three genes <b>apparently</b> <b>are</b> involved in the actual synthesis of the cellulose fibrils. These fibrils also anchor the bacteria to each other, helping to form a microcolony.|$|E

25|$|As a rule {{it is not}} {{difficult}} to guess which eyes are which in a living or preserved specimen, but sometimes it can be. Apart from the fact that in some species one or more pairs may be missing, sometimes eyes from the posterior and anterior rows may be very close to each other, or even fused. Also, either one row or both might be so grossly curved that some of the notionally anterior eyes actually may lie posterior to some of the eyes in the posterior row. In some species the curve is so gross that the eyes <b>apparently</b> <b>are</b> arranged into two anteroposterior parallel rows of eyes.|$|E
25|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the San Francisco garter snake is a densely vegetated pond near an open hillside {{where it can}} sun, feed, and find cover in rodent burrows; however, markedly less suitable habitat can be successfully used. Temporary ponds and other seasonal freshwater bodies are also appropriate. This subspecies avoids brackish marsh areas because its preferred prey, the California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii), cannot survive in saline water. Emergent and bankside vegetation such as cattails (Typha spp.), bulrushes (Scirpus / Schoenoplectus spp.), and spike rushes (Juncus spp. and Eleocharis spp.) <b>apparently</b> <b>are</b> preferred and used for cover. The zone between stream and pond habitats and grasslands or bank sides is characteristically utilized for basking, while nearby dense vegetation or water often provide escape cover. The subspecies occasionally uses floating algal or rush mats, when available.|$|E
25|$|Eastern Anatolia, {{where the}} Pontic and Anti-Taurus {{mountain}} ranges converge, is rugged country with higher elevations, a more severe climate, and greater precipitation than are {{found on the}} Anatolian Plateau. The {{western part of the}} Eastern Anatolia Region is known as the Anti-Taurus, where the average elevation of mountain peaks exceed 3,000 meters; while {{the eastern part of the}} region was historically known as the Armenian Highland and includes Mount Ararat, the highest point in Turkey at 5,137 meters. Many of the East Anatolian peaks <b>apparently</b> <b>are</b> recently extinct volcanoes, to judge from extensive green lava flows. Turkey's largest lake, Lake Van, is situated in the mountains at an elevation of 1,546 meters. The headwaters of three major rivers arise in the Anti-Taurus: the east-flowing Aras, which pours into the Caspian Sea; the south-flowing Euphrates; and the south-flowing Tigris, which eventually joins the Euphrates in Iraq before emptying into the Persian Gulf. Several small streams that empty into the Black Sea or landlocked Lake Van also originate in these mountains.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the recent}} past, small tears were treated arthroscopically, while larger tears would usually require an open procedure. [...] Advances in {{arthroscopy}} now allow arthroscopic repair {{of even the}} largest tears, and arthroscopic techniques are now required to mobilize many retracted tears. [...] The results match open surgical techniques, while permitting a more thorough evaluation of the shoulder at time of surgery, increasing the diagnostic value of the procedure, as other conditions may simultaneously cause shoulder pain. Arthroscopic surgery also allows for shorter recovery time although significant differences in postoperative pain or pain medication use <b>apparently</b> <b>are</b> not seen between arthroscopic- and open-surgical patients.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} town hall {{meetings}} held by members of Congress during the August 2009 congressional recess were the site of protests and disruptions by opponents of this health care reform legislation. [...] Steven Pearlstein of The Washington Post wrote that the concerns raised {{in most of these}} town hall disruptions are factually incorrect claims made by some conservative members of Congress and some in the right-wing media in opposition of the reform bill. Wendell Potter, who has been an executive of Cigna, a for-profit health insurer, stated that health insurance companies [...] "are very much behind the town hall disruptions that you see {{and a lot of the}} deception that’s going on in terms of disinformation that many Americans, <b>apparently,</b> <b>are</b> believing." ...|$|E
2500|$|While a {{comprehensive}} review of the Anatidae which unites all evidence into a robust phylogeny is still lacking, the reasons for the confusing data are at least clear: As demonstrated by the Late Cretaceous fossil Vegavis iaai — an early modern waterbird which belonged to an extinct lineage—the Anatidae are an ancient group among the modern birds. Their earliest direct ancestors, though not documented by fossils yet, likewise can be assumed to have been contemporaries with the dinosaurs. The long period of evolution and shifts from one kind of waterbird lifestyle to another have obscured many plesiomorphies, while apomorphies <b>apparently</b> <b>are</b> quite often the result of parallel evolution, for example the [...] "non-diving duck" [...] type displayed by such unrelated genera as Dendrocygna, Amazonetta, and Cairina. For the fossil record, see below.|$|E

2500|$|Aquila chrysaetos daphanea Severtzov, 1888 – known {{variously}} as the Asian {{golden eagle}}, Himalayan golden eagle or berkut. This race is distributed in central Kazakhstan, eastern Iran and the easternmost Caucasus distributed to Manchuria and central China {{and along the}} Himalayas from northern Pakistan {{in the west to}} Bhutan in the east (rarely ranging over into northernmost India) discontinuing in northeastern Myanmar. This subspecies is the largest race on average.

The forehead and crown are dark with a blackish cap {{near the end of the}} crown. The feathers of the nape and top-neck are rich brown-red. The nape feathers are slightly shorter than in the nominate race and are similar in length to A. c. homeyeri.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, {{publisher}} and politician Steve Forbes, writing in Forbes magazine, praised Sowell's Wealth, Poverty and Politics: An International Perspective, saying [...] "It's a scandal that economist Thomas Sowell {{has not been}} awarded the Nobel Prize. No one alive has turned out so many insightful, richly researched books. His latest is another triumph of crackling observations that underscore the ignorance of our economists and policymakers. His take on how culture, geography, politics and social factors affect how societies progress—or don't—will rile those addicted to political correctness but leave everyone else wiser." [...] Columnist Steven Pearlstein of The Washington Post criticized Sowell, saying [...] "as an intellectual combatant, Sowell thrives on jousting with straw men whose existence he posits {{with little or no}} proof. In the world according to Sowell, liberals (including rich ones, <b>apparently)</b> <b>are</b> so filled with envy and resentment that they will deny billionaires the chance to create new jobs and new products if it means adding even a dollar to their incomes. Black leaders want to keep their people in poverty because otherwise they would have no purpose. The media and government officials systematically ignore and cover up racially motivated black-on-white violence (he knows about these incidents, according to the footnotes, from major news outlets). These are more like the rants of a talk-radio host than the considered judgments of a respected academic." [...] Walter E. Williams stated, [...] "Wealth, Poverty and Politics: An International Perspective is a true gem in terms of exposing the demagoguery and sheer ignorance of politicians and intellectuals in their claims about wealth and poverty." ...|$|E
