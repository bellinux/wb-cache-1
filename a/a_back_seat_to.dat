By January 1878, when he wrote to Mrs. von Meck about its members, he had drifted far from their musical world and ideals. In addition, The Five's finest days had long passed. Despite considerable effort in writing operas and songs, Cui had become better known as a critic than as a composer, and even his critical efforts competed for time with his career as an army engineer and expert in the science of fortification. Balakirev had withdrawn completely from the musical scene, Mussorgsky was sinking ever deeper into alcoholism, and Borodin's creative activities increasingly took <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> his official duties {{as a professor of}} chemistry.|$|E

The discussion escalates into a fight, during which Megan makes a hurtful remark about Don's mother, and Don storms out and drives off without her.

25|$|Ascani {{was born}} on May 29, 1917 in Beloit, Wisconsin to Italian {{immigrants}} just 14 years after the Wright brothers achieved powered flight. His interest in aviation was sparked in 1927 when he watched Charles Lindbergh fly overhead in the Spirit of St. Louis on his historic flight to Paris. His family moved to Rockford, Illinois, several miles downriver from Beloit, where Ascani attended Rockford High School and enjoyed a hobby building model airplanes. He graduated as high school valedictorian in 1935 and attended Beloit College for two years. In 1937, Ascani was accepted at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated 34th out of a class of 425 and in 1941 was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Corps of Engineers. Engineering took <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> aviation when Ascani was sent to Hicks Field for initial flight training and Foster Army Air Field for advanced flight training.|$|E
25|$|Paleolithic peoples {{suffered}} less {{famine and}} malnutrition than the Neolithic farming tribes that followed them. This was partly because Paleolithic hunter-gatherers accessed {{a wider variety}} natural foods, which allowed them a more nutritious diet and a decreased risk of famine. Many of the famines experienced by Neolithic (and some modern) farmers were caused or amplified by their dependence on {{a small number of}} crops. It is thought that wild foods can have a significantly different nutritional profile than cultivated foods. The greater amount of meat obtained by hunting big game animals in Paleolithic diets than Neolithic diets may have also allowed Paleolithic hunter-gatherers to enjoy a more nutritious diet than Neolithic agriculturalists. It has been argued that the shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture resulted in an increasing focus on a limited variety of foods, with meat likely taking <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> plants. It is also unlikely that Paleolithic hunter-gatherers were affected by modern diseases of affluence such as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease, because they ate mostly lean meats and plants and frequently engaged in intense physical activity, and because the average lifespan was shorter than the age of common onset of these conditions.|$|E

25|$|On Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing {{the injured}} left ankle that {{he picked up}} a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for Alan Gordon in the 78th minute of a 0–1 {{friendly}} loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer. With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Eva Longoria, Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Drew Carey among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as Andriy Shevchenko, Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, and Frank Lampard, the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by Steve Sidwell whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US – a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN. As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than British Open golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the Indy Racing League's Honda 200 motor race.|$|E

40|$|Within fiber optics, plastic {{optical fibers}} (POFs) {{have always had}} <b>to</b> take <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> due <b>to</b> their {{relatively}} high loss. This kept them as a specialty fiber for illumination, sensing and low speed short data links. However, continued research and development on the core materials used in POFs are improving their performance significantly as we {{are now able to}} manufacture POFs with low transmission loss, high temperature resistance and stable bandwidth over distance. The improved performance, the ease of installation and the low cost of POFs has led to a renewed interest in these fibers. This review looks at the material developments that have and continue to improve the optical loss factors in POFs. Both intrinsic and extrinsic loss mechanisms are discussed. In particular the intrinsic loss mechanisms are reviewed in greater detail. Intrinsic losses are associated with the chemical and physical structure of the fiber materials, while extrinsic losses are related to losses due to contaminants and various production imperfections...|$|R

40|$|This {{relative}} {{dearth of}} material {{is due to}} a number of obvious and some less obvious factors. 1948 is the marker of transformation in Palestine and the historic moment whose shadow hangs over everything, including scholarship, though the Nakba is an on-going colonial process of which the war in 1967 is a major aspect. For historians, working on the Nakba within the (narrow) lens of 1948 has been a duty of national importance. After all, the mere scope and size of Zionist mythology on the matter has taken decades to counter. If the victor tells the tale, Palestinians have been trying desperately for three generations, and at the very least, to proclaim: we did and do exist here. Within this colonial context it is even more troubling to reflect on Jerusalem in 1967 and think about how the important work of “recording” has taken <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> relative <b>to</b> our other individual and collective concerns.

Power metal often makes use of Major chord progressions as well as circle progressions. Some {{of the most influential}} and acclaimed power metal guitarists are Kai Hansen of Gamma Ray, Michael Weikath of Helloween, and Timo Tolkki formerly of Stratovarius. It is a common trait in power metal for the bass guitar <b>to</b> take <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat,</b> so <b>to</b> speak; often simply providing the chord root notes and being drowned out by the more prevalent rhythm guitars. However, some power metal bands incorporate bass that is more audible with colorful patterns distinct from the rhythm guitars, such as Helloween, Hibria, and Symphony X.|$|R

He added that Doug Mahnke's pencils grounded the story in Geoff John's universe, but felt the battle sequences were not as good as Ivan Reis' in Justice League 22. Jesse Schedeen of IGN, who gave the issue an 8.1 out of 10, was wary that the [...] "heavy emphasis on The Outsider and his schemes made [...] "Trinity War" [...] feel less like the big event DC has been building towards since the start of the New 52 and more like another stepping stone on the road to Forever Evil," [...] but was surprised at Johns' ability to not dwell on The Outsider that much in this issue, and give each member a moral ambiguity, questioning their role in the conflict. Schedeen, however, was disappointed at how little the Trinity of Sin appeared in the issue. He also felt that the Justice League of America series got its strongest contender for art in Mahnke, but noted that it was not his best effort. Comic Book Resources gave the issue 3.5 stars out of 5, with Doug Zawisza saying he was not impressed with the issue, with a lot going on, and nothing really moving forward.

Another factor accounting for the late development of political science is its evolution as a byproduct of philosophy, law and history.

This article assesses the interest of Turkish political scientists in European integration in terms of the evolution of research agenda and teaching specializations. At the beginning of the 1990 s, relatively little attention was paid to European integration among political scientists in terms of both their teaching and research agendas, however, since 1999 there has been an increased emphasis on both in Turkey.
