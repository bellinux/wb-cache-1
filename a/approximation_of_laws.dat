40|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{objectives}} of integration policies, one of the crucial activities of the European Community was to ensure the <b>approximation</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> of the Member States {{to the extent necessary}} for the functioning of the common/internal market. In this field, the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty has not brought along any significant changes. The substantive provisions conferring competence may be added, deleted or modified, as part of another common policy that contributes to the functioning of the internal market, without requiring changes in the procedural rules of the law approximation policy itself. Moreover, primary law includes several provisions on law approximation, without giving sufficient indication of any comprehensive definition of this concept, providing only a general and vague normative framework. For this reason, it was the judicial interpretation of the rules of cross-community policy of the approximation of legislation that came to complete the provisions of the treaties in a creative and evolutionary manner. In order to explain and analyse this evolution, this paper will first focus {{on the nature of the}} provisions on law approximation set by the treaties and then examine how those provisions were interpreted and completed by the Court of Justice...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We compute {{explicit}} bounds in {{the normal}} and chi-square approximations of multilinear homogenous sums (of arbitrary order) of general centered independent random variables with unit variance. Our techniques combine an invariance principle by Mossel, O’Donnell and Oleszkiewicz with a refinement of some recent results by Nourdin and Peccati, about the <b>approximation</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> of random variables belonging to a fixed (Gaussian) Wiener chaos. In particular, we show that chaotic random variables enjoy the following form of universality: (a) the normal and chi-square approximations of any homogenous sum can be completely characterized and assessed by first switching to its Wiener chaos counterpart, and (b) the simple upper bounds and convergence criteria available on the Wiener chaos extend almost verbatim to the class of homogeneous sums. These results partially rely {{on the notion of}} “low influences ” for functions defined on product spaces, and provide a generalization of central and non-central limit theorems proved by Nourdin, Nualart and Peccati. They also imply a further drastic simplification of the method of moments and cumulants – as applied to the proof of probabilistic limit theorems – and yield substantial generalizations, new proofs and new insights into some classic findings by de Jong and Rotar’. Our tools involve the use of Malliavin calculus, and of both the Stein’...|$|E
40|$|Background: All {{experimental}} animal protection legislation {{is based on}} the premise that, under certain conditions, it is morally acceptable to use animals for experimental and other scientific purposes. Directive on the <b>approximation</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws,</b> regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes (86 / 609 /EEC) adopted in 1986, was one of the key international acts, which has started to regulate the legislation on the protection of {{experimental animal}}s in Europe. It has a legal force and therefore obligates all member states of European Union to implement its provisions through their national legislation. However, in Slovenia the field of the protection of experimental animals has actually started to regulate with the adoption of the Animal Protection Act and other subsidiary legal acts that define legitimate purposes and conditions on which animals for experimental purposes may be used. Conclusions: The aim {{of this article is to}} introduce in brief the present situation in the field of experimental animal protection legislation in Slovenia. At the same time, we would like to warn the reader, that the legislation is both an interpretative and dynamic subject, constantly changing and developing, because the ethic and the legal criteria of the society depend on the time and the space in which we live. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to point out the {{necessity}} to address trafficking in human beings in a larger context of migration. The development of an overall European Union concept relating to migration in Europe is being mapped out by the European Commission, which sees the handling of migration issues in the context of the political objectives of European integration and in particular the establishment of an "Area of Freedom, Security and Justice " in the EU (COM 2000, 0757 final). The Commission is not, however, in a position autonomously to shape the legislative agenda on migration as, notwithstanding the Treaty changes introduced at Amsterdam, the Member States remain in the driving seat and their initiatives have tended to concentrate on reacting to immediate migration "pressures " rather than on building an overall strategy. Legal basis questions are beginning to arise when criminal law measures are contemplated in relation to the combating of trafficking. The very need for the <b>approximation</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws,</b> though foreseen in the Treaty on European Union, is questioned by some states, and- especially in the context of such a sensitive issue as migration- national legal approaches can be difficult to reconcile. Consensus within the Council on legislative measures is not easily achieved. There are, however, many practical and political pressures on the EU to agree at least a minimum o...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Use {{of plant}} {{ingredients}} in aquaculture feeds is impeded by high contents of antinutritional {{factors such as}} saponins, which may cause various pharmacological and biological effects. In this study, transcriptome changes were analyzed using a 21 [*]k oligonucleotide microarray and qPCR in the distal intestine of Atlantic salmon fed diets based on five plant protein sources combined with soybean saponins. Results Diets with corn gluten, sunflower, rapeseed or horsebean produced minor effects while the combination of saponins with pea protein concentrate caused enteritis and major transcriptome changes. Acute inflammation was characterised by up-regulation of cytokines, NFkB and TNFalpha related genes and regulators of T-cell function, while the IFN-axis was suppressed. Induction of lectins, complement, metalloproteinases and the respiratory burst complex parallelled a down-regulation of genes for free radical scavengers and iron binding proteins. Marked down-regulation of xenobiotic metabolism was also observed, possibly increasing vulnerability of the intestinal tissue. A hallmark of metabolic changes was dramatic down-regulation of lipid, bile and steroid metabolism. Impairment of digestion was further suggested by expression changes of nutrient transporters and regulators of water balance (e. g. aquaporin, guanylin). On the other hand, microarray profiling revealed activation of multiple mucosal defence processes. Annexin- 1, with important anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective properties, was markedly up-regulated. Furthermore, augmented synthesis of polyamines needed for cellular proliferation (up-regulation of arginase and ornithine decarboxylase) and increased mucus production (down-regulation of glycan turnover and goblet cell hyperplasia) could participate in mucosal healing and restoration of normal tissue function. Conclusion The current study promoted understanding of salmon intestinal pathology and establishment of a model for feed induced enteritis. Multiple gene expression profiling further characterised the inflammation and described the intestinal pathology at the molecular level.

40|$|The European Community (EC), in particular, took {{upon itself}} {{the role of}} the key {{external}} player in the political and economic restructuring programs in Eastern Europe. It successfully used a combination of aid packages and advice-giving, to frame its political and economic relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. For their part, the Eastern states, hoping for a quick path to a convertible currency and EU membership, fully embraced the free market philosophy by swallowing the bitter pill of shock therapy, mass privatization and deregulation. The Eastern Europeans have gradually come to a significant twofold realization. First, that membership {{is not likely to be}} offered any time soon. And second, that there are significant barriers to the strengthening of ties with the EU. The EU eventually responded to the growing pleas for membership by announcing that the special relationship between Western and Eastern Europe would be assured through association agreements pursuant to Article 235 of the Treaty of Rome. Initially, the EU did not intend to make any reference in the Europe Agreements to future membership of the Association countries. A major indicator in the Europe Agreements, which highlights the EU's fundamental concern over its own interests rather than assisting Eastern Europe in the transition process, are the trade provisions. In essence, these maintain significant, potentially long-term barriers to trade between the EC and the East, particularly in sensitive sectors such as steel, textiles and agriculture. A second obstacle to the Associate countries' accession are the relatively weak institutional links created by the Europe Agreements. Convergence of laws is another important condition which needs to be satisfied before membership is granted to the Eastern European applicants. The present approach excludes the Eastern Europeans from exemption from the EU's anti-dumping law; it shuts them out of most of the EU's decision making; and it limits the effectiveness of their attempts to harmonise their legislation with the EU. Taken collectively, it seems certain that these exclusions will seriously restrict the Associates' prospects of rapid integration into the EU. The compromise may involve complicated negotiations between member states and also with potential applicants.

40|$|It {{is universally}} {{known that the}} {{approach}} towards tax law has always been characterized by strong differences between indirect and direct taxation. The need for harmonization concerning the system of value added tax, for the uniformity regarding customs law and for a similar framework {{in the field of}} excise duties, still cope with a secondary Community legislation in the field of direct taxation that is fragmented, incomplete and episodic. This {{is the result of a}} necessary compromise imposed by a decision-making model which is no longer compatible with the zeitgeist of the new millennium. From this point of view neither the Charter of Nice nor the new European Constitution in Rome (even the abridged version that has prevailed at the latest meeting in Berlin) appear to be adequate to change this approach. Interventions in the field of direct taxation, both for individuals and for certain businesses, such as trading companies and permanent establishments, are focused on areas in which bilateral treaties did not provide an adequate protection to the taxpayer, or where the contractual nature of the instrument clearly demonstrates an intrinsic inadequacy. Thus, the 1990 / 435 / EEC [2], 2003 / 48 /EC [3], 2003 / 49 /EC [4] and, of most interest here, the 1990 / 434 /CEE [5] directives came to light, among others. Leaving aside the crucial role played by the European Court of Justice on the progressive removal of barriers to a common market and, indirectly, the <b>approximation</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> in those areas that clash with a more effective harmonization, it remains that all the above-mentioned instruments still show an unmistakable common characteristic: they are all oriented to minimize the occurrence of double taxation on passive income. Dividends, interest and royalties now benefit from an EU framework intended to apportion the taxing powers amongst the different States potentially interested (State of residence of the payee and the payer, for instance). The only exception in this respect is the one related to the regime of capital gains. If arguably practical reasons have excluded such a need in the case of realization of capital gains determined by the sale of securities or other property, the EU legislator was concerned with this issue only when taxation of capital gains do not guarantee the neutrality imposed by the Treaty (in general) and the fundamental freedoms laid down and protected by it. In this context, reference was made to specific extraordinary corporate operations (mergers, divisions and transfers of assets, for example) suitable to generate capital gains taxable in two European states at least, considering as such the States where the companies involved are placed, or where the assets are dislocated. With the last mentioned Directive, 1990 / 434 /CEE (so called “Parent – Subsidiary), the EU lawmaker has confirmed this need for tax neutrality for the above-mentioned corporate operations, giving the full fiscal neutrality to extraordinary corporate reorganization that could generate potentially taxable gains. This is true especially in cases where a company was, for example, merged with another resident in another European country, ending up with the former which had to leave its residence in the State of origin (even in this case would be more appropriate to conclude that it was actually winded up to all relevant effects). Among the cases classified as “extraordinary” in the Directive, the simple transfer of registered office of the company is never mentioned despite it could be considered an extraordinary corporate operation from the point of view of many legal systems, including the Italian one, where it is not entirely prohibited (such is the case for the Netherlands). Even if we ignore for now the taxation of individuals, a tax loophole seems already to emerge. In recent years doctrine, jurisprudence and the European Commission have tried to provide an adequate response to it. This is the problem of the so-called “Exit taxes” as introduced by the scientific literature with respect to its possible incompatibility with EC law, and confronted by the EU Commission in a quite original way. The problem that we raise in this short survey, apart from the comment of the ECJ case law which was discussed elsewhere, is the mobility within the EU and the relevance of such income transfers, whether they involve individuals or corporate entities, or both. In this perspective the question is undoubtedly peculiar: it pertains not only to a case of income transfer, but rather to a sort of “trans-nationality” involving, on the one hand, the status of the taxpayer (who belongs at the beginning to a State and subsequently to another within the EU, and on the other hand, whether one or both States attach importance to the transfer of residence abroad, up to what amount of his/her taxable base can be taxed in the former or in the latter, perhaps in a later time. The transfer of registered office or residence from one State to another is still, under many circumstances, comparable to the realization of unrealized capital gains on specific assets, according to the State in question. The taxation of capital gains is sometimes carried out (especially following the case law cited above) in a subsequent moment (maybe in a different tax period and in coincidence with the effective realization of the asset on the market) while other times, as still happens in the Italian system, it even coincides with the transfer of headquarters abroad, at least for corporations. In brief, what seems to emerge from this partial reconstruction is a framework in which every European country makes its own tax claim potentially different from those of other countries with respect to the same situation. The absence (or apparent absence) of specific rules to regulate mobility within the Union in terms of taxes emphasises the potential conflict between States, and therefore international double taxation within the EU, as mentioned above. From this array of mutually-conflicting claims, there are two certainties: first, that in a system such as the current one, corporate and personal mobility is still strongly affected, in terms and conditions, and arguably not consistently with the provisions of the Treaty, and secondly, that something has been lost (or perhaps never acquired by the Union, namely what in taxation could be revised as Nomos of tax territoriality...|$|E
