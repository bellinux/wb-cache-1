2500|$|Another {{method for}} {{quantifying}} risk {{of ovarian cancer}} is the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA), observes levels over time and [...] determines if they are increasing rapidly enough to warrant transvaginal ultrasound. The Risk of Ovarian Malignancy algorithm uses CA-125 levels and HE4 levels to calculate the risk of ovarian cancer; {{it may be more}} effective than RMI. The IOTA models can be used to estimate the probability that an adnexal tumor is malignant. They include LR2 risk model, The Simple Rules risk (SRrisk) calculation and Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the <b>Adnexa</b> (ADNEX) model {{that can be used to}} assess risk of malignancy in an adnexal mass, based on its characteristics and risk factors. The QCancer (Ovary) algorithm is used to predict likelihood of ovarian cancer from risk factors.|$|E

30|$|Lee et al. [15] {{suggested}} that vNOTES {{should be avoided}} in patients with an adnexal mass larger than 80  mm due to technical difficulties. We, however, successfully managed to perform adnexectomy by vNOTES in two patients with an adnexal mass larger than 80  mm (110 and 100  mm, respectively) without significantly increasing the duration of surgery. All <b>adnexae</b> were resected in toto. In case of a large mass, an endoscopic bag was used. The pursestring of the endobag was pulled through the colpotomy and released outside the vagina. Before removing the bag, the mass was first punctured to aspirate its content and reduce its volume.

The patient presented with foul smelling ulcers of the medial and lateral orbital walls of the right eye extending into the lids and nose, teeming with maggots. Computerized Tomography (CT) showed widespread bone destruction with extension into surrounding sinuses. Over 200 maggots were manually removed after immobilisation with turpentine oil instillation.

40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} {{the pattern of}} ocular and visual complications of head injury. Method A prospective study of 225 head-injured patients managed at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Ilorin, Nigeria. For the purpose of extracting vaisual complications, a Neurosurgeon and an Ophthalmologist examined each patient and appropriate investigations were carried out. Patients with ocular morbidity were analysed for age, sex, cause of injury, admission Glasgow coma score, and associated injuries in addition to findings at ophthalmic and neurosurgical evaluations. Results Two major types of ocular and visual complications were observed in 57 (25. 3 %) of 225 head-injured patients studied. Soft-tissue injury to the globe and <b>adnexae</b> included periorbital ecchymosis, subconjuctival haemorrhage, lid laceration, or rarely globe rupture in 29 patients. Neuro-ophthalmic ocular cranial nerve palsies occurred in 28 patients, while orbital fracture was encountered in two patients. Ocular injuries were multiple in 60 % of cases. The patients, comprising 37 male and 20 female subjects, were aged 9 months to 57 years (mean 28 years). Traffic accident was {{the leading cause of}} head injuries (84. 2 %), while fall from height (7 %), assault (7 %), and gunshot (1. 8 %) were miscellaneous causes. Conclusion Injury to the globe and <b>adnexae</b> and ocular cranial nerve palsies constitute the most common oculovisual complications following head injury in our centre...|$|R
