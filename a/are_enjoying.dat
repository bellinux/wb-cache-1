25|$|The Pacer {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the formerly unloved cars from the 1970s that <b>are</b> <b>enjoying</b> a resurgence in both collectibility and auto restorationâ€”especially among fans of cars from that era. The Pacer is one of several 1970s cars that were always thought of as cheap vehicles; therefore they were poorly maintained, which reduced their life expectancy. Also the heavy engines used in the car put more load on the front suspension than intended, which caused the rack & pinion steering to fail frequently on Pacers built in 1975.|$|E

Reports are stored electronically and printed selectively as the need arises. Many MTs now utilize personal computers with electronic references and use the Internet not only for web resources {{but also as a}} working platform.

500|$|As {{late as the}} 1960s, glowbugs {{were part}} of many {{beginner}} ham stations, and the ARRL Radio Amateur Handbook for those years exhibited a number of such simple, tube-based designs.

Many hams are assembling [...] "glowbug rigs" [...] on improvised chassis such as tin cakepans and wooden boards, and putting them on the air between 7040 â€“ 7050kHz and 7114 â€“ 7125kHz. Amateur radio Glowbug enthusiasts can often be heard communicating on the shortwave bands via CW using Morse code. Popular frequencies to hear glowbug contacts are around 3560kHz and also 3579.5kHz, chosen because crystals for this frequency can be salvaged from discarded color TV sets, along with other transmitter components.|$|E

Marlene considers Ben weak, so Leslie becomes determined to prove that he is a tough boss to impress Marlene.|$|E
500|$|Lim Kit Siang {{attributed}} the opposition's defeat to Mahathir's liberalism and the government's {{adoption of the}} DAP's stance on issues like [...] "language, culture and education". Some, however, doubted Mahathir's sincerity.

We share the political power with the Chinese. When they need to increase their political support from their community it is very important for them to serve the main concerns of the Chinese. So, why shouldn't we allow that? We can... achieve a win-win situation. This is a purely political move.... Similarly we UMNO Youth have to be often seen as a very racialist political group fighting for the Malay interests.... However, those finished agendas that we have done, such as Islam, Bahasa Melayu [...] and the special status of the Malays, should not be questioned in any circumstance because these are very sensitive issues." ...|$|E

She added that Mercedes does not have much to lose in her life. After her stalking of Mitzeee, Mercedes went on to stab herself, on this Carena Crawford of All About Soap said the episode itself was a [...] "huge shocker" [...] due to Mercedes' actions. Crawford added that when Mercedes realises she will be blamed for knocking Mitzeee unconscious she sees the knife and [...] "mad Mercedes {{came up with the}} perfect plan and we winced as she plunged the blade into her own stomach, knowing everyone would think Mitzeee did it! So now manipulative Mercedes has the upper hand over her rival [...] After all, whoâ€™d suspect anyone of stabbing themselves â€“ very few people are warped enough to do that".|$|E
