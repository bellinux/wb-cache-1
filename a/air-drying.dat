2500|$|Fixation {{is usually}} {{performed}} by incubation {{in a solution}} of a buffered chemical fixative, such as glutaraldehyde, sometimes in combination with formaldehyde and other fixatives, and optionally followed by postfixation with osmium tetroxide. The fixed tissue is then dehydrated. Because <b>air-drying</b> causes collapse and shrinkage, this is commonly achieved by replacement {{of water in the}} cells with organic solvents such as ethanol or acetone, and replacement of these solvents in turn with a transitional fluid such as liquid carbon dioxide by critical point drying. The carbon dioxide is finally removed while in a supercritical state, so that no gas–liquid interface is present within the sample during drying.|$|E
2500|$|Such clay {{has a high}} [...] "shrink-swell" [...] ratio {{depending}} upon {{the amount of water}} present. As it dries from a saturated to a dry state it shrinks greatly – as seen in the cracked clay deposits of drying flooded areas – and this characteristic presents a serious problem to the potter. As the vessel is fired, any water left in the clay will tend to quickly turn to steam and explode the vessel wall in a spawl. It takes care and time to dry these vessels before they can be fired safely. Moreover, as even a well-tempered vessel dries shrinkage rates vary around the contours of the form and will create strains which will crack an air drying vessel if the drying is not slowed and controlled. A high shrinkage rate probably meant lots of effort lost to broken pots in both the drying and firing stages for inexperienced potters and ineffective technologies. Woodland potters attempted to remedy the high shrinkage by using large amounts (up to 33%) of coarse sand and/or grog temper in their efforts to render the clay usable for vessel construction. Moreover, their vessel shapes were necessarily confined to either a flat or conical-bottomed vessel and a thick walled construction were required in order for the vessel to stand, in an unfired state, without collapsing during the <b>air-drying</b> process in preparation for firing. Non-backswamp clays used {{in many parts of the}} world could use grog and/or sand and create a round-bottomed vessel, favored by the cook, but not so with the [...] "gumbo" [...] clays of the Mississippi Valley.|$|E

30|$|The {{emissions}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} from <b>air-dried,</b> conventionally dried, and high-temperaturedried sugi wood were compared by gas chromatographymass spectrometry. Terpenes were clearly the main compound group in the <b>air-dried</b> wood samples, whereas acetic acid was only detected in the high-temperature-dried wood samples, indicating that considerable changes occurred in the volatile compound emission profile during hightemperature processing. The most abundant compounds in the <b>air-dried</b> wood and conventionally dried wood were δ-cadinene, α-muurolene, and β-cadinene (sesquiterpenes) for all specimens, and a-pinene and D-limonene (monoterpenes) for conventionally dried wood and <b>air-dried</b> wood. In contrast, acetic acid was detected only in the hightemperature-dried wood. Sensory evaluation of volatile organic compounds was performed by 18 male university students. Volatile compounds of <b>air-dried</b> wood and conventionally dried wood were assessed as being significantly more soothing than those from high-temperature-dried wood.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the utility of}} the cell transfer technique (CTT) for BRAF molecular testing on thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) specimens. Methods: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) –based BRAF molecular testing was performed on tissues obtained through CTT from both <b>air-dried</b> and ethanol-fixed direct smears of thyroid FNA specimens and then compared with the corresponding thyroidectomy formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues on 30 cases. Results: BRAF testing was successfully performed on 29 of 30 <b>air-dried</b> CTT, 27 of 30 ethanol-fixed CTT, and 27 of 30 FFPE tissues. The results exhibited 11, 13, and 13 BRAF mutations and 18, 14, and 14 wild types for the <b>air-dried</b> CTT, the ethanol-fixed CTT, and the FFPE tissues, respectively. The concordance rate was 96 % between <b>air-dried</b> and ethanol-fixed CTT tissues, 88 % between <b>air-dried</b> CTT and FFPE tissues, and 92 % between ethanol-fixed CTT and FFPE tissues.
