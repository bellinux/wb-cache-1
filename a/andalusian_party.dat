50|$|While in Spain, Ibn Habib {{involved}} {{himself in}} the conflicts which immediately erupted between the commanders of the defeated army (the Syrian regiments (junds)), and the resident governor, Abd al-Malik ibn Qatan al-Fihri. When the Syrian commander Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri tortured and executed the elderly Ibn Qatan, a Fihrid relative, Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib openly broke with the Syrians and joined the <b>Andalusian</b> (baladi) <b>party.</b> Ibn Habib participated in the Battle of Aqua Portora in August 740 and it was claimed {{by at least one}} chronicler (Ibn al-Khatam) that he sought out and fatally wounded Balj in the heat of battle (although the chronicler may have confused Ibn Habib with another Abd al-Rahman, Ibn al-Qama al-Lakhmi, the governor of Narbonne and commander of the Andalusians). In the aftermath, Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib tried to put himself forward as a candidate to replace the governor, but gave up on these ambitions with the arrival of Abu al-Khattar ibn Dirar al-Kalbi as Andalusian governor in 743, who then set about pacifying the situation.|$|R

50|$|Andalusian {{nationalism}} is the nationalism which asserts that Andalusians {{are a nation}} and promotes the cultural unity of Andalusians. It {{is considered to be}} represented primarily by the <b>Andalusian</b> <b>Party</b> but there are also lesser political organisations that identify with Andalusian nationalism.

50|$|Pedro Sánchez, {{a member}} of the PSOE unknown to the public and much of the party membership, succeeded Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba as Secretary General of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party in the 26 July 2014 party {{extraordinary}} congress, having won a leadership election held earlier that month with 48.7% of the membership vote to Eduardo Madina's 36.2%. Andalusia President Susana Díaz's support for Sánchez to hold off Madina was a determining factor in Sánchez's victory, as the <b>party's</b> <b>Andalusian</b> membership voted overwhelmingly in favour of Sánchez. Madina's move to trigger a primary election forced Díaz—who was said to be seeking an election by acclamation—out of the leadership race, prompting her to support Sánchez in order to prevent a potential Madina victory.|$|R
5000|$|Senante {{inherited}} ultraconservative political outlook {{from his}} ancestors. His {{grandfather was a}} subscriber of the Carlist daily El Siglo Futuro in the 1870s and in the 1880s, when the newspaper followed the breakaway Integrist path; also his father engaged in politically loaded public disputes. Having completed academic period and driven principally by his profound religiosity, back in his home city Manuel threw himself into Alicantine public activities. He associated with the Conservative Party in 1897 and commenced his long editorial career first by contributing and later by running a local <b>party</b> <b>Andalusian</b> daily, La Monarquía (1899-1900). He became active in numerous local Catholic initiatives, e.g. hosting Junta Organizadora for erection of the Century Cross in Alicante in 1901. [...] Senante started to contribute to El Siglo Futuro himself in 1901, initially with short informative pieces. [...] Already in 1902 he was hailed as “elocuentisimo abogado” and “uno de los católicos más firmes y decididos”. In the early 20th century Senante dissociated himself from the conservatives and approached Partido Católico Nacional, the Integrist political party; in 1903 he was already reported by the press as “joven abogado alicantino, integrista ayer”. The same year he tried his luck in elections to the Cortes, especially that according to some sources he was already {{one of the most}} influential personalities of the Right in the province. He stood as a candidate of Liga Católica, a newly formed electoral platform promoted by the Church in Spain. For reasons which are not clear he fielded his candidature in the south-Levantine city of Orihuela, possibly the southernmost Carlist outpost at the Mediterranean cost, animated by a small but active Traditionalist group, but was defeated by the famous liberal politician, Francisco Ballesteros.|$|R
50|$|The Andalusian Progress Party (in Spanish: Partido Andaluz del Progreso; PAP) was an Andalusian {{nationalist}} {{political party}} in Andalusia, founded in 1993 by Pedro Pacheco (then mayor of Jérez de la Frontera), {{as the result}} of a split in the <b>Andalusian</b> <b>Party</b> (PA) due to the confrontation between Alejandro Rojas-Marcos and Pacheco himself, who it ended with the departure of him and his supporters from the party.|$|E
50|$|If {{one takes}} into account the Union of the Democratic Centre (Unión de Centro Democrático, UCD), {{predecessor}} to the PP, this is roughly representative of the major parties in local politics in the years since the Spanish transition to democracy. The United Left (Izquierda Unida, IU) has also elected councilors on several occasions, as has the <b>Andalusian</b> <b>Party.</b> AVEMA has been a force in local politics since the 1995-1999 legislative session. PIM was newly formed in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Incumbent President Manuel Chaves {{from the}} Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE-A) was re-elected for a sixth {{term in office}} with a {{slightly}} reduced majority. Final results showed a major breakthrough by the People's Party (PP), which gained 10 seats from 37 to 47 and scored its best result in the community at the time. United Left (IULV-CA) remained stagnant with 6 seasts, whereas the <b>Andalusian</b> <b>Party</b> (PA) suffered a major drop in support and failed to enter the regional parliament for the first time.|$|E
50|$|The Municipal Corporation {{comprises}} 17 councillors. In {{the municipal}} elections of May 27, 2007, the PP won 9 council seats with 45.73 {{percent of the}} votes, while the left-of-centre Spanish Socialist Workers' Party-Andalusia (Partido Socialista Obrero Español-Andalucía, PSOE-A) won 6 seats with 30.19 percent. The Asociación de Vecinos de Mazagón (AVEMA, the Neighborhood Association of Mazagón) won 2 seats and 13.32 percent of the votes. Two other groupings, the Partido Independiente de Mazagón (PIM, Mazagón Independent Party) and the left-of-centre Andalusian nationalist <b>Andalusian</b> <b>Party</b> also ran, but did not obtain representation, in the 2007 elections.|$|E
50|$|Only {{after the}} 1989 European Parliament {{election}} did EFA members form a united group, called Rainbow like its green predecessor. It {{consisted of three}} Italian MEPs (two for Lega Lombarda {{and one for the}} PSd'Az), two Spanish MEPs (one each for the PNV and the <b>Andalusian</b> <b>Party,</b> PA), one Belgian MEP (for VU), one French MEP (Union of the Corsican People, UPC), one British MEP (SNP) and one independent MEP from Ireland. They were joined by 4 MEPs from the Danish left-wing Eurosceptic People's Movement against the EU, while the other regionalist parties, including the SVP, Batasuna and the Convergence and Union of Catalonia (CiU) declined to join.|$|E
50|$|On 3 April 1979 Spain {{held its}} first {{democratic}} municipal elections {{after the end of}} Franco's dictatorship; councillors representing four different political parties were elected in Seville: the Union of the Democratic Centre or Unión de Centro Democrático (UCD) won nine councilors, the <b>Andalusian</b> <b>Party</b> or Partido Andalucista (PA) won eight, the Spanish Socialist Party or Partido Socialista Obrero Español (PSOE) won eight as well and the Communist Party of Spain or Partido Comunista de España (PCE) won six. As no party achieved a sufficient majority to govern, a coalition government was formed, with power shared between the PSA, the PSOE and the PCE. The coalition elected Councilman Luis Uruñuela of the Partido Andalucista as mayor.|$|E
50|$|With the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) regaining its {{absolute}} majority in Andalusia in the 2004 election, Manuel Chaves {{was able to}} govern alone again, after 10 years of minority government, having relied on {{the support of the}} <b>Andalusian</b> <b>Party</b> in the previous 8 years. Teófila Martínez, who had been PP candidate for President of Andalusia in the previous two elections (1996 and 2000), was replaced by Javier Arenas as head of the Andalusian People's Party (PP). Arenas had been PP candidate in the 1994 and 1996 elections, but left the PP regional leadership in order to become Spain's Minister of Labor and Social Affairs in the Aznar cabinet and, later, Secretary-General of the People's Party.|$|E
50|$|Seville {{began the}} century under the {{leadership}} of the socialist Mayor Alfredo Sanchez Monteseirín (PSOE), who had held the position of alderman since June 1999 with support from the PA, the PP being the largest party. In 2003 he was again invested as mayor, winning this time as the candidate with the most popular votes but not an absolute majority, and in this case supported by the councilors of the United Left. The outcome of the elections in May 2007 validated the progressive pact of the (PSOE-IU), surpassing the number of votes submitted by the People's Party (PP) or the <b>Andalusian</b> <b>Party</b> (PA), leaving the latter without representation in the council and the PP with the most votes of all the parties represented in the Consistorio. Thus Sánchez Monteseirín ranks as the first mayor in the history of democracy in Seville to serve three times on the city council in power, despite having been only once the candidate with the most votes from the electorate and the filing of corruption charges of illegal financing through the issue of false invoices.|$|E
