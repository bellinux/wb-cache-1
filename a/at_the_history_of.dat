5|$|Stratton wrote Experimental Psychology and its Bearing upon Culture {{to explain}} both typical {{psychological}} experiment methodology {{and how the}} results obtained answered philosophical problems. The book covered experimental results in psychology and how they influenced overall social behavior and the everyday cultural life of people. It did so by looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> experimental psychology, and then surveying experimental methods covering both their applications and limits. Stratton pointed out how psychological experiments differed from the ones in physiology. The survey of experiments also included studies on mental perception, including among the blind. Stratton noted that the blind did {{have a sense of}} space. He also described how measurements of mental phenomena were both possible and being done in practice, though he did believe the results had to be interpreted on a psychic scale different from the usual physical ones used for measures such as lengths and weights. He rejected the argument the mind was unitary and could not be studied by splitting it into parts, by drawing on the analogy of studying a tree by looking at its constituent parts, themselves not functionally trees. He presumed sensations were akin to trees in how they could be split up into parts.|$|E

25|$|When {{addressing}} {{police brutality}} in Latvia, {{it is important}} to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the country and how this affects its police and brutality towards the population. Latvia became an independent Republic in 1918 and attempted to develop an effective and accepted police force, moving away from the untrusted Russian Tsarist Administration. Despite positive post-independence aims to reform the police system and to maintain public order and security, the Latvian police were underfunded and under-resourced. The National Militia was created in response, being a voluntary force for the protection of public order. Policing during this period was quite successful, being assimilated to what is today referred to as community policing.|$|E

500|$|Stebbins's review, [...] "The {{significance}} of polyploidy in plant evolution", published in American Naturalist in 1940, demonstrated how work done on artificial polyploids and natural polyploid complexes {{had shown that}} polyploidy was important in developing large, complex, and widespread genera. However, by looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> polyploidy in plant families, he argued that polyploidy was only common in herbaceous perennials and infrequent in woody plants and annuals. As such, polyploids played a conservative role in evolution since problems with fertility prevented the acquisition and replication of new genetic material {{that might lead to}} a new line of evolution. This work continued with the 1947 paper [...] "Types of polyploids: their classification and significance", which detailed a system for the classification of polyploids and described Stebbins' ideas about the role of paleopolyploidy in angiosperm evolution, where he argued that chromosome number may be a useful tool for the construction of phylogenies. These reviews were highly influential and provided a basis for others to study the role of polyploidy in evolution.|$|E
500|$|... "At Long Last Leave", {{which is}} the 500th episode of The Simpsons, was written by Michael Price. The Simpsons showrunner Al Jean has {{described}} it as [...] "a tribute to people who love the show." [...] Being a fan of musical theater, Price titled the episode {{in reference to the}} Cole Porter song [...] "At Long Last Love". Price did not write [...] "At Long Last Leave" [...] with the intention of it becoming the 500th episode; that decision was made afterwards when the staff members realized the story offered an opportunity for a look-back <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the Simpson family. He {{said in an interview with}} the magazine Channel Guide that he was [...] "deeply honored" [...] when his episode was selected for the milestone. As acknowledged by Price in that interview, the plot of the episode features similarities to the 2007 film The Simpsons Movie, in which the Simpsons are forced to flee to Alaska after Homer angers the townspeople in Springfield by polluting a lake. However, Price commented that [...] "I think it's different from the movie in that it sort of does reference back the entire history of the show, the collective experience of Springfield vis-a-vis the Simpsons, whereas the movie they were forced to run away due to that very specific thing". He further noted that despite the similarities [...] "we [...] liked it enough to go with it anyway." [...] The plot was first announced to the press at the Comic-Con convention in San Diego, California on July 23, 2011, during a panel with the cast and crew of The Simpsons.|$|E

Here's the result of our disintegration!" [...] (Zakharyin's words over Ivan the Terrible's dead body), [...] "I am to blame for all of this... Oh God, why did you make me Tsar?!"

The trilogy continued to divide opinion in Russia up until 1917. Not long before the Revolution, in Alexandrinsky Theatre the public reacted to Tsar Boris in an overtly political fashion. Monarchists applauded Boris Godunov's words, the left [...] "supported" [...] boyarin Sitsky, seeing in him a fighter of despotism.|$|E
