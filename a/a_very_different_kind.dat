For many problems, {{it is possible to}} begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made.

Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing, beam search and random optimization.|$|E

In {{order to be}} a fully functional succinct representation for these domains, the k 2 -tree must support all the required operations for binary relations. In their original description, the authors include how to answer {{some of the most}} relevant queries over the k 2 -tree. In this paper, we extend this functionality and detail the algorithms to efficiently compute the k 2 -tree resulting from the union, intersection, difference or complement of binary relations represented using k 2 -trees. ...|$|R
500|$|The two symphonies are {{strongly}} contrasted with one another. The First is {{on a large}} scale, reminiscent at times of Sibelius.

Critics have always differed on whether the finale lives up {{to the rest of the}} work. In comparison with the First, the Second Symphony struck many reviewers as lightweight, and, as with many of Walton's works of the 1950s, it was regarded as old fashioned. It is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> of work from the First Symphony. David Cox describes it as [...] "more a divertimento than a symphony ... highly personal, unmistakably Walton throughout", and Kennedy calls it [...] "somewhat enigmatic in mood, and a superb example of Walton's more mature, concise, and mellow post-1945 style." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} {{explanations}} of the Greek success. Most scholars believe that the Greeks had better equipment and used superior tactics. According to Herodotus, the Greeks were better equipped. They did not use bronze upper body armour at this time, but that of leather or linen.

40|$|Magnetic clouds (MCs), {{and more}} generally, interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), are {{believed}} to be the interplanetary counterparts of CMEs. The link has usually been shown by taking into account the CME launch position on the Sun, the expected time delay and by comparing the orientation of the coronal and interplanetary magnetic field. Making such a link more quantitative is challenging since it requires <b>a</b> relation between <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>kinds</b> of magnetic field measurements: (i) photospheric magnetic maps, which are observed from a distant vantage point (remote sensing) and (ii) in-situ measurements of MCs, which provide precise, directly measured, magnetic field data merely from one-dimensional linear samples. The association between events in these different domains can be made using adequate coronal and MC models. Then, global quantities like magnetic fluxes and helicity can be derived and compared. This review paper describes all the general trends found in the above association criteria. A special focus is given for the cases which do not follow the earlier derived mean laws since interesting physics is usually involved...|$|R

Charlotte's epistles, to which she was well accustomed, were of <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> style and <b>kind.</b> She {{generally}} wrote on large note-paper; she twisted up her letters into the shape and sometimes into the size of cocked hats; she addressed them in a sprawling, manly hand, and not unusually added a blot or a smudge, as though such were her own peculiar sign-manual. The address of this note was written in a beautiful female hand, and the gummed wafer bore on it an impress of a gilt coronet. Though Eleanor had never seen such a one before, she guessed that it came from the signora. Such epistles were very numerously sent out from any house in which the signora might happen to be dwelling, but they were rarely addressed to ladies. When the coachman was told by the lady's maid to take the letter to Mrs. Bold, he openly expressed his opinion that there was some mistake about it. Whereupon the lady's maid boxed the coachman's ears. Had Mr. Slope seen in how meek a spirit the coachman took the rebuke, he might have learnt a useful lesson, both in philosophy and religion.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} advances {{the explanation}} of behaviour of creative art, design and communication practitioners. It uses notions of receiver persuasion and gratification as analytic tools to understand perceptions of people starting businesses in the creative sector. The study shows {{the importance of the}} personal perceptions of the cultural message sender and that sender-recipient tensions among creative art, design and communication practitioners are detrimental {{to the development of the}} government’s enterprise culture. The entrepreneurially unusual responses of such practitioners to enterprise culture norms indicate that a subculture of entrepreneurial practice might exist. Blending notions from cognitive anthropology, cultural schemas and audience reception of culture to explore art, design and communication practises makes the methodology and focus of this work original. It borrows multidisciplinary perspectives of communication and enterprise to examine perception themes of creative practitioners. The paper asserts that although individual reception and acceptance of norms in the enterprise culture operates through reciprocal benefits, the basis of that reciprocity differs from mainstream entrepreneurs. Creative and cultural policy issues arise from this paper. This is because people responsible for implementing government enterprise initiatives at a local level need to engage with creative art, design and communication practitioners with support of <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> and specific <b>kind.</b> The paper was presented at the Cultures and Contexts 2007 Conference and appears in its proceedings.

Many of his plays are now forgotten, but a number, including Major Barbara, Saint Joan (usually considered his masterpiece) and Pygmalion [...] are still regularly performed. Pygmalion [...] was the basis for the movie My Fair Lady, a fact which benefitted the National Gallery of Ireland as Shaw had left the royalties of the play to the gallery.

40|$|The {{interdisciplinary}} work {{presented here}} {{deals with the}} management of diverse types of information collected during an archaeological excavation, and organized as an XML based data management system. The approach is global, from the consultation of three-dimensional data to simple textual data, and to additional data captured by a digital photogrammetry system called ARPENTEUR, which is now fully integrated to the XML data management system. This work {{is available on the}} Internet: [URL] A stratigraphic approach and a set of underwater photogrammetric survey was done after the excavation process. The photogrammetric orientation work was done in Photomodeler 4. 0 (camera calibration and bundle adjustment). The final plotting of amphoras and other artefacts was done using the ARPENTEUR software after importation of all camera orientation data from Photomodeler. The Arpenteur plotting phase is driven by a theoretical model of the measured artefact. The resulting survey is described in a set of XML files containing all measured data (2 D, 3 D and computed amphoras or artefacts). At this point, a data management system (based on XML technology) is built in order to access to all the data from 2 D or 3 D representation of the site on the Internet. In the framework of multimedia data management system as photographs, indexation of metadata available as XML documents is particularly convenient. Thanks to this formalism we can represent in an homogeneous way <b>a</b> set of <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> of data such as : − Structural description of the image content (given by an expert), − Physical data as color histogram, color zone, (with automatic extraction) − Photogrammetric data − Metadata as : intellectual properties, shooting date, policy of right, original support, etc [...] . This homogeneous representation management of the data coming from different sources is an opportunity to elaborate a request on the whole set of data. On the other hand the results data (also generated in XML) allows a simple and automatic publication of the result towards different media as HTML or PDF for example. The implementation of such a system has to be done in close collaboration with experts of the investigated domain (here underwater archaeology) in order to build a relevant data model and adapt the request algorithm to the specific problematic. The XML document structure allows <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> of data indexation : − Intuitive way, by interactive navigation, − Simple way as keyword research (for example as search engine, i. e. Google) − Accurate way by request formalisation as we can do in a traditional DBMS with SQL.
