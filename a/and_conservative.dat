40|$|This article {{examines}} citizens who combine liberalism {{on one of}} two major issue dimensions with conservatism on the other, assessing whether they are less politically engaged than “consistent ” liberals <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> <b>and</b> whether this relationship has strengthened over time with elite polariza-tion. It also explores the contributions of cross-pressures, partisanship, and alienation to contemporary ideological differences in political engagement. This article departs from most existing research by defining ideology two dimensionally. Using the 1984 - 2008 American National Election Studies, it finds that culturally conservative, economically liberal Americans {{and to a lesser}} extent culturally liberal, economically conservative Americans are less engaged in elections than “consistent ” liberals <b>and</b> <b>conservatives.</b> Different factors explain these differences with liberals <b>and</b> <b>conservatives,</b> but cross-pressures do not demobilize either “two-dimensional ideologue. ” Over time, the increased involvement of liberals <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> has produced a growing ideological gap in political engagement...|$|R

40|$|Liberals <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> exhibit {{different}} cognitive {{styles and}} converging lines of evidence suggest that biology influences {{differences in their}} political attitudes and beliefs. In particular, {{a recent study of}} young adults suggests that liberals <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> have significantly different brain structure, with liberals showing increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> showing increased gray matter volume in the in the amygdala. Here, we explore differences in brain function in liberals <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> by matching publicly-available voter records to 82 subjects who performed a risk-taking task during functional imaging. Although the risk-taking behavior of Democrats (liberals) <b>and</b> Republicans (<b>conservatives)</b> did not differ, their brain activity did. Democrats showed significantly greater activity in the left insula, while Republicans showed significantly greater activity in the right amygdala. In fact, a two parameter model of partisanship based on amygdala and insula activations yields a better fitting model of partisanship than a well-established model based on parental socialization of party identification long thought {{to be one of the}} core findings of political science. These results suggest that liberals <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> engage different cognitive processes when they think about risk, and they support recent evidence that conservatives show greater sensitivity to threatening stimuli. © 2013 Schreiber et al...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the moral stereotypes political liberals <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> have {{of themselves and}} each other. In reality, liberals endorse the individual-focused moral concerns of compassion and fairness more than <b>conservatives</b> do, <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> endorse the group-focused moral concerns of ingroup loyalty, respect for authorities and traditions, and physical/spiritual purity more than liberals do. 2, 212 U. S. participants filled out the Moral Foundations Questionnaire with their own answers, or as a typical liberal or conservative would answer. Across the political spectrum, moral stereotypes about "typical" liberals <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> correctly reflected the direction of actual differences in foundation endorsement but exaggerated the magnitude of these differences. Contrary to common theories of stereotyping, the moral stereotypes were not simple underestimations of the political outgroup's morality. Both liberals <b>and</b> <b>conservatives</b> exaggerated the ideological extremity of moral concerns for the ingroup {{as well as the}} outgroup. Liberals were least accurate about both groups...|$|R
