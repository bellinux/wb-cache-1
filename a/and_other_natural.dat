5|$|Darjeeling {{has seen}} a {{significant}} growth in its population, its decadal growth rate being 47% between 1991 and 2001. The colonial town was designed for a population of only 10,000, and subsequent growth has created extensive infrastructural and environmental problems. The district's forests <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> wealth have been adversely affected by an ever-growing population.|$|E
5|$|Extending {{the work}} of Vesalius into {{experiments}} on still living bodies (of both humans and animals), William Harvey <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> philosophers investigated the roles of blood, veins and arteries. Harvey's De motu cordis in 1628 {{was the beginning of}} the end for Galenic theory, and alongside Santorio Santorio's studies of metabolism, it served as an influential model of quantitative approaches to physiology.|$|E

5|$|Like {{some other}} {{grassland}} psilocybin mushroom {{species such as}} P.mexicana, P.tampanensis and Conocybe cyanopus, P.semilanceata may form sclerotia, a dormant form of the fungus, which affords it some protection from wildfires <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> disasters. The German mycologist Jochen Gartz even succeeded in producing sclerotia on a malt agar surface culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{was built}} to withstand earthquakes, forest fires, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> disasters. The 2002 Denali earthquake damaged some of the pipeline sliders designed to absorb similar quakes, and it caused the pipeline to shut down for more than 66 hours as a precaution.

5|$|Following his {{confrontation}} with the returned Spider-Man after his campaign against Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man's body, Norman Osborn has been rid of the Goblin formula from his system and thus the lost of his superhuman abilities, forcing him to rely on his intellect <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> abilities. Doctor Octopus's anti-serum also prevents Osborn's attempts of restoring his powers, ultimately he seeks to rid it in hopes of having them again despite risking his health and sanity.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Exmoors {{were used}} as pit ponies. Ponies not kept in semi-feral {{conditions}} are used {{for a variety of}} activities including showing, long-distance riding, driving, and agility. Exmoor ponies won both divisions at the International Horse Agility Championships in 2011, and took a third title at the 2012 Championships. The breed's hardiness makes it suitable for conservation grazing, and it contributes to the management of many heathland, chalk grassland <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> pasture habitats, {{as well as to the}} conservation of Exmoor itself.|$|E

5|$|Like {{some other}} psychoactive {{grassland}} {{species such as}} Psilocybe semilanceata, Conocybe cyanopus, P.tampanensis can form sclerotia–a hardened mass of mycelia that is more resistant to adverse environmental conditions than normal mycelia. This truffle-like form gives the fungus some protection from wildfires <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> disasters. Other Psilocybe species known to produce sclerotia include Psilocybe mexicana and Psilocybe caerulescens. Sclerotia are also produced when the species is grown in culture.|$|E
5|$|Many {{other types}} of {{tessellation}} are possible under different constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular tessellation, made {{with more than one}} kind of regular polygon but still having the same arrangement of polygons at every corner. Irregular tessellations can also be made from other shapes such as pentagons, polyominoes and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist M. C. Escher is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped like animals <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> objects. If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for the tiles of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors.|$|E
5|$|Mycotoxins are {{secondary}} metabolites (or natural products), {{and research}} has established {{the existence of}} biochemical pathways solely {{for the purpose of}} producing mycotoxins <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> products in fungi. Mycotoxins may provide fitness benefits in terms of physiological adaptation, competition with other microbes and fungi, and protection from consumption (fungivory). Many fungal secondary metabolites (or derivatives) are used medically, as described under Human Use below.|$|E

5|$|Norwegian army {{units were}} skiing for sport (and prizes) in the 18th century. Starting {{in the latter}} part of the 20th century, {{technique}} evolved from the striding in-track classic technique to include skate-skiing, which occurs on courses that have been groomed with wide lanes for those using the technique. At the same time, equipment evolved from skis and poles that were made of wood <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> materials to comprising such man-made materials as fiberglass, carbon fiber, and polyethylene plastics.|$|E
5|$|The bronzes of Igbo-Ukwu pay special {{attention}} to detail depicting birds, snails, chameleons, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> aspects of the world such as a hatching bird. Other pieces include gourds and vessels which were often given handles. The pieces are so fine that small insects were included on the surfaces of some while others have what looks like bronze wires decorated around them. None of these extra details were made separately; the bronzes were all one piece. Igbo-Ukwu gave the evidence of an early bronze casting tradition in Nri.|$|E
5|$|The pagoda {{has been}} damaged by {{earthquakes}} <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> calamities over the centuries, and has been refurbished from time to time. A notable renovation {{was carried out by}} King Bayinnaung (r. 1551–1581) during late 16th century. In the 1975 earthquake there was considerable damage to the spire and the dome necessitating large renovation. It is now substantially strengthened with covering of more than 30,000 copper plates, which were donated by local and international devotees; gilding of the dome has been done during 1983–1984 and again in recent times. However, the pagoda's bottom level terraces have remained mostly in their original form.|$|E

5|$|The park {{is divided}} into three {{horizontal}} sections, and architects considered the rivers <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> characteristics of the St. Louis area when designing the park. The northern limestone wall represents the Mississippi River bluffs, while the southern snaking meander wall stands is inspired by the region's waterways. Between the two zones are the rain gardens, larger trees, and larger sculptures, an area that meant to represent a floodplain. The main paths of the park were plotted to match the locations of alleyways that park designers saw in a 1916 Sanborn map.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the stop lines and the {{anti-tank}} islands that followed was to hold up the enemy, slowing progress and restricting the route of an attack. The need to prevent tanks from breaking through was of key importance. Consequently, the defences generally ran along pre-existing barriers to tanks such as rivers and canals; railway embankments and cuttings; thick woods; <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> obstacles. Where possible, usually well-drained land was allowed to flood, making the ground too soft to support even tracked vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{disasters}} <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> occurrences {{are also}} sources of mortality. The West Indian manatee and Dugong face risks from hurricanes and cyclones, which are predicted {{to increase in}} the future. These storms may also damage seagrass populations. Exposure to brevetoxin from Karenia brevis during a red tide event are also sources of mortality; {{they may be able}} to be exposed to brevetoxin after a red tide has subsided, as it could settle on seagrasses. African manatees can become stranded during the dry season when rivers and lakes become too small or dry up completely.|$|E
