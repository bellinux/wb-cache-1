40|$|An embayment in the {{southern}} rock slopes of Little Loch Broom, NW Scotland, was surveyed {{using a combination of}} morphological mapping and engineering geology techniques. The evidence points to a large-scale rock slope failure (rock <b>avalanche)</b> mechanism of <b>formation,</b> occurring during glacial downwasting and retreat, perhaps initiated by debuttressing and stress release. Periglacial activity, such as macrogelivation or large-scale frost-wedging, may have exacerbated the internal joint network by expanding the aperture dimensions of pre-existing joints leading to an increase in stresses and a reduction in friction across joint surfaces. The rockwall cavity was completely evacuated by the rock debris, leaving the embayment with a mantle of sediments originating from the glacial diamicton that drapes the plateau above the backwall.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Variations of snow {{surface and}} snowpack {{properties}} affect <b>avalanche</b> <b>formation.</b> In {{up to four}} north-facing slopes above the tree line near Davos, Switzerland, snow surface properties were characterized. Penetration resistance was measured with a snow micro-penetrometer. The sampling scheme was designed to allow a multi-scale approach covering the snowpack depth scale (0. 5 – 5 m), the slope scale (5 – 100 m) and the basin scale (100 – 1000 m). Observations and measurements were compared to the data of a nearby automatic weather station (AWS). The AWS data were also used to model snow-cover stratigraphy and its evolution with the numerical snow-cover model SNOWPACK. Comparing the four slopes showed that surface properties observed manually were similar among the three slopes that were sheltered, and often different from the slope that was wind-exposed. However, the penetration resistance of the surface layer was in most cases significantly different among slopes, although most values were < 0. 1 N, indicating very low hardness. These seemingly contradictory results follow from the different measurement support of the two methods. It is presently unclear which amount of variation at a given scale is relevant for <b>avalanche</b> <b>formation.</b> The geostatistical analysis and an analysis aimed at identifying the causes of variability were not conclusive. No patterns emerged that would allow conclusions regarding the effect on <b>avalanche</b> <b>formation.</b> Finding the causes of variability seems to require high-resolution terrain and weather models that are presently not readily available...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} with MFM and MOKE finite squared (rectangular) {{arrays of}} circular (elliptical) magnetic dots and performed simulations with MuMax, a GPU-based software. We showed as for limited {{size of the}} periodic arrays the transition of the magnetization during the reversal starts at the edges and corners of the array and propagates inside the pattern, so that in a restricted field range the magnetization results to be not uniformly distributed. While {{the shape of the}} dots (circular, elliptical, etc.) introduces a Configurational Anisotropy, we find that the finite array dimensions introduce an additional Global Configurational Anisotropy. Both effects originate at the demagnetizing interactions playing at different space scales: the dot and total array space scale, respectively. Simulations of dot arrays are often restricted to one dot assuming isolated non-interacting magnetization processes. Periodic boundary conditions are often used to incorporate interdot interactions, still limiting computations to a restricted number of dots and assuming infinite lattice periodicity. Then, configurational anisotropy is accounted for, but global configurational anisotropy is not. We show that mutual dot interactions together with finite array dimensions have a nonnegligible impact on the magnetization reversal of a dot array. We numerically and experimentally study the hysteresis properties of Permalloy (Py) arrays of 16 x 16 circular and elliptical dots, with thickness ranging between 10 and 25 nm and lateral size between 300 and 500 nm. In magnetooptical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements, in-field magnetic force microscope (MFM) measurements and simulations, we find that global shape anisotropy steers the magnetization reversal of the array: the dots run through different magnetization states depending on the dot location and collective magnetization processes occur, leading to transition <b>avalanches</b> and <b>formation</b> of magnetization chains. Moreover, we find that imperfections as edge roughness and external perturbations, as the MFM measurement itself, anticipate the dots reversal path set by the global configurational anisotropy and promote field induced magnetization state changes. These findings are important in the development of applications that rely on a robust control of dot magnetization states in dot arrays...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{experimental}} investigation of the photoconductively switched gas-filled spark gap. When the laser intensity of a femtosecond laser is high enough (around 1018 Wm- 2), a plasma can be created that spans the complete distance between the electrodes. The gas-filled spark gap is then closed on a femtosecond timescale, similar to photoconductive switching of a semiconductor switch. Stochastic breakdown processes, such as <b>avalanche</b> and streamer <b>formation</b> that cause the breakdown in laser triggered spark gaps, are passed over, which results in faster risetime and less jitter. Measurements of the switched pulses {{as a function of}} laser energy were performed in a 1 mm gap at an applied voltage of 4. 5 kV.

Measurements of the output pulses with the gap filled with nitrogen at 1 atm showed results very similar to measurements in air in the same gap. In the switching regime, the amplitude of the switched pulse did not depend strongly on the laser energy. Measurements at lower applied voltages but with the same gap distance showed {{that it was possible to}} switch voltages as low as 10 % of the self-breakdown voltage.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} rock avalanches in tectonically active terrains including {{the effects of the}} deposits on glacier behaviour and their contribution to moraine formation. The chronologies of mountain glacier fluctuations, based on moraine ages, are widely used to infer regional climate change and are often correlated globally. In actively uplifting mountain ranges rock avalanches that travel onto the ablation zone of a glacier can reduce ice-surface melting by insulating the ice. This can cause buried ice to thicken due to slower ablation and can signiﬁcantly alter the overall glacier mass balance. This glacier response to supraglacial rock avalanche deposits can confound apparent climatic signals extracted from moraine chronologies. This thesis investigates the processes through which rock avalanche deposits may affect glaciers and develops a new technique to identify the presence of rock avalanche debris in glacial moraines. From laboratory experiments on the effects of debris on ice ablation it is demonstrated that the rate of underlying ice ablation is controlled by diurnal cyclicity and is amplified at high altitude and in lower latitudes. The relatively low permeability of rock avalanche sediment in comparison with non-rock avalanche supraglacial debris cover contributes to the suppression of ablation, at least partly because it greatly reduces the advection of heat from rain water to the underlying ice. The laboratory findings are supplemented by field investigations of two recent rock avalanche deposits on glaciers in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. This work demonstrates that the rock avalanche deposits are very thick (10 m at Aoraki/Mt. Cook and 7 m at Mt. Beatrice) and almost stopped the ablation of the overlying ice. This resulted in the formation of an ice-platform more than 30 m high. This led to a reduction of the existing negative mass balance of the affected Tasman and Hooker Glaciers. There was little noticeable alteration of the overall glacial regime due to the small scale of the debris covered area (4 and 1 % of the ablation zones for the Tasman and Hooker Glaciers, respectively) but there is a significant contribution to supraglacial debris, which is passively transported toward the terminus. A conceptual model of the response of mountain valley glaciers to emplacement of extensive rock avalanche debris on the ablation zone has been proposed for the effect of this type of debris on terminal moraine formation based on enhanced ‘dumping’ of supraglacial sediments. A new technique has been developed to distinguish rock-avalanche-derived sediment from sediment of glacial origin, based on the sedimentary characteristics of the finest fraction. Examination of rock avalanche sediment under the Scanning Electron Microscope showed that finer particles tend to form strong clumps, which comprise many smaller (down to nanometre-scale) clasts, named here ‘agglomerates’. These agglomerates are present in the ﬁne fraction of all examined rock avalanche deposits and absent in known non-rock-avalanche-derived glacial sediments. The agglomerates are characteristics of sediment produced under the high-stress conditions of rock avalanche emplacement and contrast with lower-stress process sub- and en-glacial environments. It is demonstrated that these agglomerates are present in some moraines in the Southern Alps of New Zealand that have been attributed to climate fluctuation. Consequently, this technique has the potential to resolve long-standing arguments about the role of rock <b>avalanches</b> in moraine <b>formation,</b> and to enhance the use of moraines in palaeoclimatological studies...|$|R
40|$|Rock avalanching {{is a very}} {{hazardous}} process in mountain areas, that generates a high risk in inhabited valleys. Present glacier shrinkage and permafrost degradation in steep rockwalls could increase the frequency and magnitude of rock avalanching {{in the context of}} the current climate change. In high glaciated mountain, rock avalanches interact with glaciers in different ways. Oversteepening of rock slopes by glacial erosion, and effects of glacier thinning and retreat on debuttressing of rockwalls and on permafrost prepare rock avalanche triggering. Channelling of rock avalanche by moraines and glacial valleys, incorporation of ice, and irregularities on the glacier surface modify the rock-avalanche mobility. High elevated scars resulting from rock <b>avalanches</b> favour the <b>formation</b> of small glaciers. Here, we describe how rock avalanche deposits modify glacier dynamics, and how complex could moraine complexes result from rock avalanches onto glaciers, basing our arguments on case studies mainly located in three of the larger massifs of the Western Alps: Mont Blanc, Vanoise and Ecrins massifs. Large debris accumulation deposited by a rock avalanche onto the glacier surface is a driving factor of the glacier dynamics because it can strongly reduce its ablation, especially when the glacier becomes debris-covered. Modification of the glacier mass balance by a dense debris cover allows: (i) the rate of retreat or advance of its front to be different than this of a clean-type glacier, with accelerated advance during positive mass balance periods, and slow down retreat during negative ones; this is illustrated for instance by the control of 1920 and 1997 rock avalanches on the dynamics of Brenva Glacier; (ii) advances to last longer or to reach further downvalley, as shown by the case of Miage Glacier both during the Neoglacial and the 20 th Century; and (iii) small glaciers to survive at a lower elevation than the regional ELA (e. g. Grande Casse or Drus Glaciers). In a secondary way, the supplementary mass of debris can play a role in the modification of small, thin glacier behaviour. Finally, impact of the rock avalanche, and debris that penetrate into the glacier can alter the subglacial drainage system, contributing to short-term glacier accelerations, as possibly illustrated by the 2000 - 2002 surge-type advance at Belvedere Glacier (Monte Rosa massif). Melting of incorporated ice in a rock avalanche deposit generally reduces the maximum thickness of the hummocky final deposit to 1 - 2 metres at the glacier surface. When mainly supplied by this large amount of avalanche debris, moraine complexes may be characterized by: (i) huge lateral moraines for large- (e. g. Miage), medium (e. g. Grande Casse) or even small-sized (e. g. Drus) glaciers, the topographical shape of which can be modified (e. g. Brenva); or (ii) lateral and end moraine ridges composed of massive blocks with little or no matrix, and having a discontinuous and disorderly pattern (e. g. Triolet) - in contrast to the sub-concentric moraines of neighbouring proglacial margins of clean-type glaciers. Finally, we deal with the distinction between rock avalanche deposits and moraine sets in valleys of glaciated mountains - two assemblages of landforms which often look alike. To study these relations between rock avalanches and glacier and moraine dynamics, we combine historical data with detailed geomorphological mapping, stratigraphic observation, and absolute and relative dating...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Forest and {{especially}} evergreen conifers like pine and spruce {{are known to}} reduce <b>avalanche</b> <b>formation</b> due to their physical anchoring effect and their influence on snow pack layering through changed temperature, radiation, wind speed etc. Research shows that percentage covered by the crown reflects the forests ability to reduce avalanche danger, and crown cover is therefore often used {{as a measure of}} the forest's efficiency as protection forest. Crown cover is highest in evergreen conifer forests, but in Scandinavia, the deciduous tree species birch (Betula pubsens, subspecies alpine betula) is the most common tree species in higher elevations near the tree line. This is a small and often thin stemmed, flexible tree. Their crown is thin and field observations show that in avalanche terrain the stems of such trees have a form heavily affected by snow creep and glide and the trees are in many cases bent under the snow cover. Thus, this type of forest does not fulfill the common criteria set for protection forests and its effect on the snow cover is largely unknown. In this study we question whether typical birch forests can reduce the probability of <b>avalanche</b> <b>formation</b> through snowpack effects and anchoring. We look at cases of small avalanches in birch forest, stem densities and snow profiles inside and outside birch forest and compare observations to results from models for calculating anchoring effects...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the reset time of superconducting nanowire avalanche photodetectors (SNAPs) based on 30 nm wide nanowires. We studied {{the dependence of}} the reset time of SNAPs on the device inductance and discovered that SNAPs can provide a speed-up relative to SNSPDs with the same area, but with some limitations: (1) reducing the series inductance of SNAPs (necessary for the <b>avalanche</b> <b>formation)</b> {{could result in the}} detectors operating in an unstable regime; (2) a trade-off exists between maximizing the bias current margin and minimizing the reset time of SNAPs; and (3) reducing the reset time of SNAPs below ~ 1 ns resulted in afterpulsing...|$|E
40|$|An {{approximate}} formula {{has been}} derived for gain fluctuations in cascaded gaseous detectors such as Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs), {{based on the}} assumption that the charge collection, <b>avalanche</b> <b>formation,</b> and extraction steps are independent cascaded processes. In order to test the approximation experimentally, a setup involving a standard GEM layer has been constructed to measure the energy resolution for 5. 9 [*]keV gamma particles. The formula reasonably traces both the charge collection and the extraction process dependence of the energy resolution. Such analytic approximation for gain fluctuations can be applied to multi-GEM detectors where it aids the interpretation of measurements as well as simulations...|$|E
