25|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) {{involves the use}} of a pre-mixed lean air-fuel mixture being compressed to the point of <b>auto-ignition,</b> so electronic spark ignition is eliminated. Gasoline engines combine homogeneous charge (HC) with spark ignition (SI), abbreviated as HCSI. Diesel engines combine stratified charge (SC) with {{compression ignition}} (CI), abbreviated as SCCI. HCCI engines achieve gasoline engine-like emissions with compression ignition engine-like efficiency, and low levels of nitrogen oxide emissions (NO x) without a catalytic converter. However, unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions still require treatment to conform with automotive emission regulations.|$|E
2500|$|The NTSB also {{investigated}} {{whether the}} fuel/air mixture in the CWT {{could have been}} ignited by lightning strike, meteor strike, <b>auto-ignition</b> or hot surface ignition, a fire migrating to the CWT from another fuel tank via the vent system, an uncontained engine failure, a turbine burst in the air conditioning packs beneath the CWT, a malfunctioning CWT jettison/override pump, a malfunctioning CWT scavenger pump, or static electricity. After analysis the investigation determined that these potential sources were [...] "very unlikely" [...] {{to have been the}} source of ignition.|$|E

50|$|If {{during the}} {{compression}} stroke the air-fuel mix reaches a temperature {{greater than the}} <b>auto-ignition</b> temperature of the fuel, the fuel self or auto-ignites. When <b>auto-ignition</b> occurs (before the piston reaches {{the top of its}} travel) the up-rising piston is then attempting to squeeze the rapidly heating fuel charge. This will usually destroy an engine quickly if allowed to continue.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>auto-ignition</b> {{temperature}} of a dust is usually {{higher than that}} of vapours & gases. Examples for common materials are: ...|$|E
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are heat engines, {{and as such}} their theoretical efficiency can be approximated by idealized thermodynamic cycles. The thermal efficiency of a theoretical cycle cannot exceed that of the Carnot cycle, whose efficiency {{is determined by the}} difference between the lower and upper operating temperatures of the engine. The upper operating temperature of an engine is limited by two main factors; the thermal operating limits of the materials, and the <b>auto-ignition</b> resistance of the fuel. All metals and alloys have a thermal operating limit, and there is significant research into ceramic materials that can be made with greater thermal stability and desirable structural properties. Higher thermal stability allows for a greater temperature difference between the lower (ambient) and upper operating temperatures, hence greater thermodynamic efficiency. Also, as the cylinder temperature rises, the engine becomes more prone to <b>auto-ignition.</b> This is caused when the cylinder temperature nears the flash point of the charge. At this point, ignition can spontaneously occur before the spark plug fires, causing excessive cylinder pressures. <b>Auto-ignition</b> can be mitigated by using fuels with high <b>auto-ignition</b> resistance (octane rating), however it still puts an upper bound on the allowable peak cylinder temperature.|$|E

5000|$|CNG is {{less likely}} to ignite on hot surfaces, since it has a high <b>auto-ignition</b> {{temperature}} (540 °C), and a narrow range (5-15 percent) of flammability.|$|E
50|$|An {{antiknock}} {{agent is}} a gasoline additive {{used to reduce}} engine knocking and increase the fuel's octane rating by raising the temperature and pressure at which <b>auto-ignition</b> occurs.|$|E
50|$|On 5 February 2016, the Chinese {{government}} {{issued the}} investigation {{report of the}} explosions. The report concluded the fire started in a container through <b>auto-ignition</b> of nitrocellulose, due to vaporization of the wetting agent during hot weather.|$|E
50|$|A fuel with {{a higher}} octane rating is less prone to <b>auto-ignition</b> and can {{withstand}} a greater rise in temperature during the compression stroke of an internal combustion engine without auto-igniting, thus allowing more power to be extracted from the Otto-Cycle.|$|E
50|$|Once ignited, {{combustion}} occurs very quickly. When <b>auto-ignition</b> occurs {{too early}} or {{with too much}} chemical energy, combustion is too fast and high in-cylinder pressures can destroy an engine. For this reason, HCCI is typically operated at lean overall fuel mixtures.|$|E
50|$|This {{bearing system}} has been tested in pumps for liquid oxygen, for example in oxygen turbopumps for thrust engines of space rockets, with the {{following}} results. SiC and SiC/SiC are compatible with liquid oxygen. In an <b>auto-ignition</b> test according to the French standard NF 28-763, no <b>auto-ignition</b> was observed with powdered SiC/SiC in 20 bar pure oxygen at temperatures up to 525 °C. Tests {{have shown that the}} friction coefficient is half, and wear one fiftieth of standard metals used in this environment.A hydrostatic bearing system (see picture) has survived several hours at a speed up to 10,000 revolutions per minute, various loads, and 50 cycles of start/stop transients without any significant traces of wear.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>auto-ignition</b> {{temperature}} of a liquid, gas or vapor is the temperature {{at which the}} substance will ignite without any external heat source. The exact temperature value determined depends on the laboratory test conditions and apparatus. Such temperatures for common substances are: ...|$|E
5000|$|Nearly all airbags are {{designed}} to automatically deploy {{in the event of}} a vehicle fire when temperatures reach 150-200 °C (300-400 °F). [...] This safety feature, often termed <b>auto-ignition,</b> helps to ensure that such temperatures do not cause an explosion of the entire airbag module.|$|E
50|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) {{is a form}} of internal combustion in which well-mixed fuel and oxidizer (typically air) are compressed to the point of <b>auto-ignition.</b> As in other forms of combustion, this exothermic reaction releases energy that can be transformed in an engine into work and heat.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine is}} {{designed}} to run without using spark ignition once it is warmed up. This is known as <b>auto-ignition</b> or dieseling, and the air/fuel mixture starts to burn due to the high temperature of the compressed gas, and/or the presence of hot metal in the combustion chamber.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} consideration is the temperature classification of the electrical equipment. The surface temperature or any {{parts of the}} electrical equipment that may {{be exposed to the}} hazardous atmosphere should be tested that it does not exceed 80% of the <b>auto-ignition</b> temperature of the specific gas or vapor in the area where the equipment is intended to be used.|$|E
50|$|Nicotine is a hygroscopic, colorless to yellow-brown, oily liquid, that {{is readily}} soluble in alcohol, ether or light petroleum. It is {{miscible}} with water in its base form between 60 °C and 210 °C. As a nitrogenous base, nicotine forms salts with acids {{that are usually}} solid and water-soluble. Its flash point is 95 °C and its <b>auto-ignition</b> temperature is 244 °C.|$|E
50|$|As this happened, the {{likelihood}} of <b>auto-ignition</b> increased even further. Projection booth fires were not uncommon {{in the early decades}} of cinema if a film managed to be exposed to too much heat while passing through the projector's film gate, and several incidents of this type resulted in audience deaths by flames, smoke, or the resulting stampede. An accident of this kind was recreated in Cinema Paradiso (1988).|$|E
5000|$|When {{running in}} <b>auto-ignition</b> mode {{the timing of}} the start of the burn is {{controlled}} by the operating state of the engine, rather than directly as in a spark ignition or diesel engine. As such {{it may be possible to}} optimize it for one operating condition, but not for the wide range of torques and speeds that an engine typically sees. The result will be reduced efficiency and higher emissions.|$|E
5000|$|A hot rich {{flashover}} {{occurs when}} the hot smoke with flammable gas ratio above the {{upper limit of flammability}} range and temperature higher than the ignition temperature leaves the compartment. Upon dilution with air it can spontaneously ignite, and the resultant flame can propagate back into the compartment, resulting in an event similar to a rich flashover. The common definition of this process is known as <b>auto-ignition</b> which is another form of fire gas ignition.|$|E
50|$|Open flame {{should never}} be used to melt the propellant, and the mix should always be heated in an oil bath, never over direct heat. This is to avoid hot spots causing <b>auto-ignition</b> or caramelization and {{degradation}} of the propellant. Preparing rocket candy in a microwave oven is very dangerous because localized hotspots can ignite. Because rocket candy is extremely flammable, it should be prepared in small batches, out of doors or in an outbuilding, and using adequate personal protective equipment (eye protection at the very least).|$|E
50|$|There is no {{electrical}} {{sparking plug}} in an <b>auto-ignition</b> diesel engine; {{the heat of}} compression raises {{the temperature of the}} air in the cylinder sufficiently to ignite the diesel when this is injected into the cylinder; after the compression stroke. The CR will customarily exceed 14:1 and ratios over 22:1 are common. The appropriate compression ratio depends on the design of the cylinder head. The figure is usually between 14:1 and 23:1 for direct injection engines, and between 18:1 and 23:1 for indirect injection.|$|E
50|$|A flame {{arrester}} (also called a deflagration arrester) functions by absorbing {{the heat from}} a flame front traveling at sub-sonic velocities, thus dropping the burning gas/air mixture below its <b>auto-ignition</b> temperature: consequently, the flame cannot survive. The heat is absorbed through channels (passages) designed into an element. These channels are chosen and measured as the mesg (Maximum Experimental Safe Gap) of the gas for a particular installation.These passages can be regular, like crimped metal ribbon or wire mesh or a sheet metal plate with punched holes, or irregular, {{such as those in}} random packing.|$|E
50|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) {{involves the use}} of a pre-mixed lean air-fuel mixture being compressed to the point of <b>auto-ignition,</b> so electronic spark ignition is eliminated. Gasoline engines combine homogeneous charge (HC) with spark ignition (SI), abbreviated as HCSI. Diesel engines combine stratified charge (SC) with {{compression ignition}} (CI), abbreviated as SCCI.

However, unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions still require treatment to conform with automotive emission regulations.|$|E
50|$|To prevent {{buildup of}} the {{deterioration}} products, stabilizers are added. Diphenylamine {{is one of}} the most common stabilizers used. Nitrated analogs of diphenylamine formed in the process of stabilizing decomposing powder are sometimes used as stabilizers themselves. The stabilizers are added in the amount of 0.5-2% of the total amount of the formulation; higher amounts tend to degrade its ballistic properties. The amount of the stabilizer is depleted with time. Propellants in storage should be periodically tested for the amount of stabilizer remaining, as its depletion may lead to <b>auto-ignition</b> of the propellant.|$|E
50|$|The section {{identifies}} {{physical and}} chemical properties associated with the chemical or mixture. As per SANS 11014:2010 this should address: appearance of the chemical (e.g. physical state, form, and colour), odour, pH(with indication of concentration), melting / freezing point, boiling point, initial boiling point and boiling range, flash point, upper/lower flammability or explosive limits, vapour pressure, vapour density, density / relative density, solubility(ies), evaporation rate, flammability (solid, gas), n-octanol/water partition coefficient, <b>auto-ignition</b> temperature, decomposition temperature, and / or viscosity. An indication of values must use SI system, as per ISO 1000 and ISO 80000-9.|$|E
5000|$|The NTSB also {{investigated}} {{whether the}} fuel/air mixture in the CWT {{could have been}} ignited by lightning strike, meteor strike, <b>auto-ignition</b> or hot surface ignition, a fire migrating to the CWT from another fuel tank via the vent system, an uncontained engine failure, a turbine burst in the air conditioning packs beneath the CWT, a malfunctioning CWT jettison/override pump, a malfunctioning CWT scavenger pump, or static electricity. After analysis the investigation determined that these potential sources were [...] "very unlikely" [...] {{to have been the}} source of ignition.|$|E
50|$|Firestops in {{occupancy}} separations {{are also}} more likely to require an equal fire protection rating (a fire resistance rating for closures). They also must provide a temperature rating ensuring that the components of the firestop systems, including the penetrants are not permitted to rise in temperature above 140°C (284°F) on average or 180°C (356°F) at any single point, to lower the likelihood of <b>auto-ignition</b> on the unexposed side. In this manner, occupancy separations are treated similarly to fire walls which are structurally stable in case of a fire, thus limiting the danger of fire-induced building collapse.|$|E
50|$|A {{backdraft}} {{can occur}} when a compartment fire {{has little or}} no ventilation, leading to slowing of gas-phase combustion (due to the lack of oxygen); combustible fuel gases (unburnt fuel vapor and gas-phase combustion intermediates such as hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide) and smoke (primarily particulate matter) remain at a temperature hotter than the <b>auto-ignition</b> temperature of the fuel mixture. If oxygen is then re-introduced to the compartment, e.g. by opening a door or window to a closed room, combustion will restart, often rapidly, as the gases are heated by the combustion and expand rapidly because of the rapidly increasing temperature.|$|E
50|$|The Cheyenne IA (PA-31T-1A-500), {{certified}} May 1983 {{and produced}} until 1985, brought together several design {{improvements to the}} basic Cheyenne I. A redesigned cowling allowed more air to flow into the engine; situating the propeller closer to the engine air scoop allowed greater recovery of high-velocity ram-air. New, streamlined exhaust stubs yielded more jet thrust than previous models and kept nacelle soot accumulation to a minimum. Together, these changes allowed higher inter-turbine temperature (ITT) limits. Other improvements to the standard airplane airframe included an <b>auto-ignition</b> system, automatic starter disengage for simplified starting procedures and a larger windshield.|$|E
50|$|It is {{the ease}} of {{splitting}} the peroxy group to give two free radicals that makes organic peroxides so useful. However, the presence of energetic free radicals during decomposition, particularly in hot gases or mists, can cause <b>auto-ignition</b> to occur at a lower temperature than would otherwise be normal for a similar chemical structure without the peroxy functional group. Organic peroxides do not generally consume oxygen {{as part of the}} decomposition so there is little risk of enhanced burning rates due to oxygen enrichment. This is unlike the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and solid oxidizers that can liberate oxygen.|$|E
50|$|Package boilers {{are fired}} from fuel {{oil in the}} form of liquid or gas. Fuel is ignited in the burners which creates an {{explosion}} within the boiler. Such package boiler do not require purifiers (filters) because they burn consistently removing all contaminants within the fuel. To create constant combustion within the boiler, the forced draft fan forces air into the burner, causing a tornado effect creating turbulence to keep the flame ignited and the furnace pressurized. Other essentials such as Burner electronics provide <b>auto-ignition</b> and on-demand lighting feature that monitors the flame and pressure within the boiler.|$|E
50|$|Dieseling is {{so named}} because it is similar in effect to how diesel engines operate: by firing without a spark. The {{ignition}} source of a diesel engine is the heat generated by the compression of {{the air in the}} cylinder, rather than a spark as in gasoline engines. The dieseling phenomenon occurs not just because the compression ratio is sufficient to cause <b>auto-ignition</b> of the fuel, but also because a hot spot inside the cylinder (spark plug electrode, combustion-chamber/valve edge or even excess carbon) starts combustion. An automobile engine that is dieseling will typically sputter, then gradually stop. This is normally seen in carbureted engines with many miles on them.|$|E
5000|$|Cool flame {{can occur}} in hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, oils, acids, waxes and even methane. The lowest {{temperature}} of a cool flame is poorly defined and is conventionally set as temperature at which the flame can be detected by eye {{in a dark room}} (cool flames are hardly visible in daylight). This temperature slightly depends on the fuel to oxygen ratio and strongly depends on gas pressure - there is a threshold below which cool flame is not formed. A specific example is 50% n-butane-50% oxygen (in volume percent) which has a cool flame temperature (CFT) of about 300 °C at [...] One of the lowest CFTs (156 °C) was reported for a C2H5OC2H5 + O2 + N2 mixture at [...] The CFT is significantly lower than the <b>auto-ignition</b> temperature (AIT) of conventional flame (see table).|$|E
