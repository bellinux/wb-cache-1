40|$|Depression is {{associated}} with subjective di - culties identifying one’s emotions, known as low emotional clarity, but the mediators and moderators of this relationship are not well understood. We hypothesized {{that the role of}} emotional clarity in emotion regulation and, in turn, depres- sion depends on individual di erences in negative <b>a</b> ect <b>intensity.</b> In Study 1, conducted in an unselected sample (N = 119), low emotional clarity more strongly predicted depression symptoms among individuals higher in <b>a</b> ect <b>intensity.</b> In Study 2, conducted in a clinically diagnosed, treatment-seeking sample (N = 245), we examined whether <b>a</b> ect <b>intensity</b> moderated <b>an</b> indirect path of clarity through emotion regulation strategy use that has emerged in previous work. Except when <b>a</b> ect <b>intensity</b> was very low, emotional clarity predicted reappraisal, and except when a ect inten- sity was very high, emotional clarity predicted non-accept- ance and experiential avoidance. By contrast, rumination mediated associations of emotional clarity with depressive symptoms regardless of <b>a</b> ect <b>intensity.</b> Findings support <b>a</b> process model of low emotional clarity in depression that integrates (1) emotion regulatory mediators and (2) modera- tion by negative <b>a</b> ect <b>intensity.</b> Trait di erences in <b>a</b> ect <b>intensity</b> may determine whether and how emotional clarity and regulation processes factor into mood psychopathology...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis examines at how libraries {{can function}} as meeting places {{in areas with}} inhabitants from sevral different countries. It {{is done in the}} form of a case study, with interviews and observations, of a minilibrary in a part of Växjö. The results are analysed with the help of Ragnar Audunsons theory about high and low intensity meeting places. According to the theory <b>a</b> high <b>intensity</b> meeting place is where a person meets people who share their intrests, whereas <b>a</b> low <b>intensity</b> meeting place is where the person are exposed to diffrent views. This study finds that the minilibrary in question funtions as both a high and <b>a</b> low <b>intensity</b> meeting place, depending on the context. When the children and youth living in the area use it as a place to meet after school, the library functions as <b>a</b> high <b>intensity</b> meeting place, and when the library hosts language cafés it becomes <b>a</b> low <b>intensity</b> meeting place...|$|R
5|$|In 2012, the NHC {{expanded}} the windspeed range for Category 4 by 1mph in both directions, to 130–156mph, with corresponding {{changes in the}} other units (113–136 kn, 209–251km/h), instead of 131–155mph (114–135 kn, 210–249km/h). The NHC and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5 knot increments, and then convert to mph and km/h with a similar rounding for other reports. So <b>an</b> <b>intensity</b> of 115 knots is rated Category 4, but the conversion to miles per hour (132.3mph) would round down to 130mph, making it {{appear to be a}} Category 3 storm. Likewise, <b>an</b> <b>intensity</b> of 135 knots (~155mph, and thus Category 4) is 250.02km/h, which according to the definition used before the change would be Category 5. To resolve these issues, the NHC had been obliged to incorrectly report storms with wind speeds of 115 kn as 135mph, and 135 kn as 245km/h. The change in definition allows storms of 115 kn to be correctly rounded down to 130mph, and storms of 135 kn to be correctly reported as 250km/h, and still qualify as Category 4. Since the NHC had previously rounded incorrectly to keep storms in Category 4 in each unit of measure, the change does not affect the classification of storms from previous years. The new scale became operational on May 15, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Since 1851, a {{total of}} 81 {{tropical}} storms and hurricanes formed {{in the month of}} June.

5|$|After Iris {{strengthened}} into a hurricane, {{it turned}} to the west-southwest due to interaction with Hurricane Humberto. An upper-level low north of Puerto Rico increased wind shear over the hurricane, which dislocated the center from the deep convection. As a result, Iris weakened to tropical storm status on August24 after being a hurricane for about 24hours. As the storm approached the Lesser Antilles, the thunderstorms decreased markedly and the cloud pattern became disorganized. As late as August25, there was uncertainty whether Iris would continue toward the islands or turn to the north. A new circulation became the dominant center as the storm continued westward, and Iris brushed Saint Lucia early on August26. An approaching trough turned the storm to the northwest, bringing it near most of the Lesser Antilles. Early on August27, Iris weakened to <b>an</b> <b>intensity</b> of , although it immediately began restrengthening. Later that day, the center made landfall on Montserrat, Anguilla, and Barbuda with winds of over 60mph (95km/h). By that time, an eye began reforming, and the structure became better organized as wind shear decreased.|$|E

After moving across northern Taiwan, Bilis made its second landfall in Fujian, China early on July 14 at the same intensity, then weakened into a tropical depression over land the next day. Bilis lingered as a tropical depression over southeastern China before degenerating into a remnant low on July 16. But the JMA carried {{the system as a}} tropical depression until July 17. Despite becoming a remnant low, the remnants of Bilis maintained their identity for several days while moving westward over China, bringing heavy rains to inland areas.|$|E
5|$|By September25, Georges {{entered the}} Gulf of Mexico and {{intensified}} into a Category 2 hurricane. The storm re-organized over the gulf, with the eye fully reforming and deep convection persisting around {{the center of}} circulation. By September27, Georges reached <b>an</b> <b>intensity</b> of 110mph (175km/h). Several hours prior to landfall the next day, the hurricane weakened slightly and tracked inland near Biloxi, Mississippi with winds of 105mph (165km/h). Upon landfall, the hurricane's forward motion slowed, executing a brief clockwise loop before maintaining an eastward drift. Gradually weakening, the hurricane was only a tropical depression by the afternoon of September29. Two days later, Georges fully dissipated near the Atlantic coast of Florida.|$|E

5|$|Data {{processing}} {{begins with}} indexing the reflections. This means identifying {{the dimensions of}} the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space group. Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine. Having assigned symmetry, the data is then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at the very least) records of the Miller index of each reflection, and <b>an</b> <b>intensity</b> for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality (what part of a given reflection was recorded on that image)).|$|E
5|$|Following {{tropical}} cyclogenesis, the fast-moving {{tropical cyclone}} quickly intensified, reaching {{the equivalent of}} a Category1 on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Between December4 and 5, however, Amy briefly weakened back to tropical storm intensity before restrengthening. Steady intensification followed afterwards, with the typhoon reaching {{the equivalent of a}} Category3 hurricane by 0000UTC on December6. By this time, the storm had slowed in forward speed. Later that day, the two, formerly separate circulation centers merged, resulting in an eye spanning 26km (16mi) in diameter. At 1200UTC on December8, Amy reached its peak intensity with winds of 220km/h (140mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg), which would classify it as a modern-day Category4 typhoon. At the same time, the tropical cyclone began to track slightly southwestward. At 0600UTC the following day, Amy made its first landfall on southern Samar with <b>an</b> <b>intensity</b> equivalent of a Category2 typhoon. Over the next two days, the typhoon weakened and moved over several islands in the Philippines including Leyte, Cebu, and Panay before emerging into the South China Sea on December11.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kate {{maintained}} {{peak intensity}} for about 18hours. On November21, a cold front {{moving through the}} Mississippi Valley deflected the hurricane {{to the north and}} northeast. The combination of cooler waters and wind shear from the front weakened Kate to <b>an</b> <b>intensity</b> of 100mph (160km/h) by the time the hurricane struck Crooked Island near Mexico Beach, Florida late on November21. After landfall, Kate continued to the northeast, crossing into Georgia and weakened into a tropical storm. Kate emerged from North Carolina into the Atlantic Ocean late on November22. Encountering even colder waters and continued shear, the storm weakened further while turning to the east-southeast. On November23, Kate transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the west of Bermuda, terminating at 1800UTC that day.|$|E
