According to Kunz's later testimony, he gave the children morphine injections but it was Magda Goebbels and SS-Obersturmbannführer Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler's personal doctor, who administered the cyanide.|$|E
5|$|At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda {{left the}} bunker {{and walked up}} to the garden of the Chancellery, where they {{committed}} suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. According to one account, Goebbels shot Magda and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide <b>ampule</b> and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into his body, which did not move.|$|E

30|$|Although more <b>ampules</b> of {{paracetamol}} for intravenous infusion and pethidine for intramuscular infusion {{were administered}} {{in the placebo}} group for controlling pain (on average 2.3 <b>ampules</b> of paracetamol/patient/day and 1.2 <b>ampules</b> of pethidine/patient/day and {{in the placebo group}} versus 0.65 <b>ampules</b> of paracetamol/patient/day and 0.48 <b>ampules</b> of pethidine/patient/day in the FICB prophylaxis group), no correlation between the number of <b>ampules</b> of paracetamol or pethidine needed and delirium occurrence was evidenced (r =  0.28, P =  0.62). According to the VAS the pain scores in the two groups did not differ significantly (mean preoperative pain score of placebo group versus FICB group were 68.2 and 61.4, respectively, P =  0.59; mean postoperative pain score of placebo group versus FICB group were 72.6 and 64.6, respectively, P =  0.34).|$|R

5000|$|Other semen {{packages}} {{that have been}} tried include the [...] "Magic Wand" [...] developed by Badger Breeders Co-op in the mid-1960s. This was a frozen pipette that contained about [...]75 cc of extended semen. With {{the use of a}} connector and adapter which had a syringe or rubber bulb attached it was air thawed or thawed in the cow. The frozen polybulb was another semen package that had some usage. Semen was actually placed in a plastic polybulb and frozen on canes. The polybulb was thawed, sealed end cut, and attached to a pipette. The semen expelled through the pipette. There were several size of <b>ampules</b> used during the early days. The 1cc <b>ampules</b> were used by Curtiss Breeding Service, [...]75cc <b>ampules</b> were used by Tri-State Breeders Co-op, and the [...]50cc <b>ampules</b> were almost excursively used by American Breeders Service. The [...]75 and 1cc <b>ampules</b> were usually attached 6 to a metal cane. The [...]50 cc <b>ampules</b> were attached 8 per cane.|$|R
25|$|It is also {{available}} for use in injectable form (IV) in Europe, {{but not in the}} U.S. The injection pack is a combination pack consisting of a vial and a separate <b>ampule</b> of reconstituting solution. Each 10-ml clear glass vial contains a white to off-white lyophilised powder consisting of omeprazole sodium 42.6mg, equivalent to 40mg of omeprazole.|$|E
25|$|Calcium (calcium {{chloride}} or calcium gluconate) increases {{threshold potential}} through a mechanism {{that is still}} unclear, thus restoring normal gradient between threshold potential and resting membrane potential, which is elevated abnormally in hyperkalemia. A standard <b>ampule</b> of 10% calcium chloride is 10 mL and contains 6.8mmol of calcium. A standard <b>ampule</b> of 10% calcium gluconate is also 10 mL but has only 2.26mmol of calcium. Clinical practice guidelines recommend giving 6.8mmol for typical EKG findings of hyperkalemia. This is 10 mL of 10% calcium chloride or 30 mL of 10% calcium gluconate. Though calcium chloride is more concentrated, it is caustic to the veins and should only be given through a central line. Onset of action is less than one to three minutes and lasts about 30–60 minutes. The goal of treatment is to normalize the EKG and doses can be repeated if the EKG does not improve within a few minutes.|$|E

25|$|Hitler and Eva Braun {{committed}} suicide {{on the afternoon}} of 30 April. On the following day of 1 May 1945, Magda and Joseph Goebbels arranged for an SS dentist, Helmut Kunz, to inject his six children with morphine so that when they were unconscious, an <b>ampule</b> of cyanide could be then crushed in each of their mouths. According to Kunz's later testimony, he gave the children morphine injections but it was Magda and SS-Obersturmbannführer Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler's personal doctor, who administered the cyanide. Author James P. O'Donnell concluded that although Stumpfegger was probably involved in drugging the children, Magda killed them herself. He surmised that witnesses blamed the deaths on Stumpfegger because he was a convenient target, having died the following day. Moreover, as O'Donnell recorded, Stumpfegger may have been too intoxicated {{at the time of the}} deaths to have played a reliable role.|$|E
25|$|Some {{money went}} to Vysotsky, {{the rest was}} {{distributed}} amongst this circle. At first this was a reasonable return on their efforts; however, as his addiction progressed and his body developed resistance, the frequency and amount of drugs needed to keep Vysotsky going became unmanageable. This culminated {{at the time of}} the Moscow Olympics which coincided with the last days of his life, when supplies of drugs were monitored more strictly than usual, and some of the doctors involved in supplying Vysotsky were already behind bars (normally the doctors had to account for every <b>ampule,</b> thus drugs were transferred to an empty container, while the patients received a substitute or placebo instead). In the last few days Vysotsky became uncontrollable, his shouting could be heard all over the apartment building on Malaya Gruzinskaya St. where he lived amongst VIP's. Several days before his death, in a state of stupor he went on a high speed drive around Moscow in an attempt to obtain drugs and alcohol – when many high-ranking people saw him. This increased the likelihood of him being forcibly admitted to hospital, and the consequent danger to the circle supplying his habit. As his state of health declined, and it became obvious that he may die, his associates gathered to decide what to do with him. They came up with no firm decision. They did not want him admitted officially, as his drug addiction would become public and they would fall under suspicion, although some of them admitted that any ordinary person in his condition would have been admitted immediately.|$|E

500|$|Afterwards, Goebbels and {{his wife}} went {{up the stairs to}} ground level and through the Führerbunker's {{emergency}} exit to the bombed-out garden behind the Reich Chancellery. There are several different accounts on what followed. According to one account, Goebbels shot his wife and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide <b>ampule</b> and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards by Goebbels' SS adjutant, Günther Schwägermann.

Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and outside. There he saw the lifeless bodies of the couple. Following Joseph Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann told an SS soldier to make sure Goebbels' was dead. The soldier fired into Goebbels' body, which did not move.

There were three subsets of CAIS, distributed in 18 different set configurations. These subsets included bottles of sulfur mustard used to purposely contaminate equipment or terrain for decontamination training. Another type of CAIS were known as [...] "sniff sets" [...] and were used to train soldiers to recognize the color and odor of chemical agents. Used indoors, the sniff sets contained agent-impregnated charcoal and agent simulants; they contained very little actual chemical warfare agent.|$|E
2500|$|Thorium tetraiodide (ThI4, yellow, m.p.556°C) is {{prepared}} by direct {{reaction of the}} elements in a sealed silica <b>ampule.</b> Water and oxygen must not be present, or else ThOI2 and ThO2 can contaminate the product. It has a different crystal structure from the other tetrahalides, being monoclinic. The lower iodides ThI3 (black) and ThI2 (gold) can be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal. (ThI is also predicted to form as an intermediate in the dissociation of ThI4 to thorium metal.) These do not contain Th(III) and Th(II), but instead contain Th4+ and could be more clearly formulated as [...] and [...] respectively. Depending {{on the amount of}} time allowed for the reaction between ThI4 and thorium, two modifications of ThI3 can be produced: shorter times give thin lustrous rods of α-ThI3, while longer times give small β-ThI3 crystals with green to brass-coloured luster. Both forms are quickly oxidised by air and reduce water, quickly forming large quantities of hydrogen gas. ThI2 also has two modifications, which can be produced by varying the reaction temperature: at 600°C, α-ThI2 is formed, while a reaction temperature of 700–850°C produces β-ThI2, which has a golden luster.|$|E
