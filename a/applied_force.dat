5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a {{frictional}} surface {{can result in a}} situation where the object does not move because the <b>applied</b> <b>force</b> is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the <b>applied</b> <b>force</b> resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the <b>applied</b> <b>force</b> up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E
5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the <b>applied</b> <b>force.</b> This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the <b>applied</b> <b>force.</b> However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E
5|$|The {{virtue of}} a {{practical}} realization based upon this definition is that unlike the Kibble balance and other scale-based methods, {{all of which}} require the careful characterization of gravity in the laboratory, this method delineates {{the magnitude of the}} kilogram directly in the very terms that define the nature of mass: acceleration due to an <b>applied</b> <b>force.</b> Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to develop a practical realization based upon accelerating masses. Experiments {{over a period of years}} in Japan with a superconducting, 30g mass supported by diamagnetic levitation never achieved an uncertainty better than ten parts per million. Magnetic hysteresis was one of the limiting issues. Other groups performed similar research that used different techniques to levitate the mass.|$|E
40|$|Study design: {{clinical}} measurement, cross-sectional. Objectives: {{to compare}} cervical mobilization <b>forces</b> <b>applied</b> by physiotherapists and students, and the {{factors associated with}} forces for each group. Background: cervical spine joint mobilization is a common manual technique for treating patients with mechanical neck pain. But {{little is known about}} the <b>forces</b> <b>applied</b> during this technique. Potential variability between therapists may result from clinical experience or may be due to factors present in individuals prior to clinical practice exposure. Methods: one hundred sixteen practicing physiotherapists and 120 physiotherapy students without clinical experience applied grades I through IV posteroanterior mobilization to the premarked C 2 and C 7 spinous and articular processes of 1 of 67 asymptomatic subjects. An instrumented table recorded <b>applied</b> <b>forces</b> (N), force amplitudes (N), and oscillation frequencies (Hz), and a custom device measured subjects’ spinal stiffness (N/mm). Independent t tests were used to compare the <b>forces</b> <b>applied</b> by therapists and students, intraclass correlation coefficients were used to determine variability, and linear regression was used to establish factors associated with <b>applied</b> <b>forces.</b> RESULTS: Students’ forces were generally lower (mean difference, 15. 7 N for grades III and IV; P<. 001) and applied with slower oscillation frequencies (0. 12 Hz; P<. 001) than therapists’ forces. Similar factors were associated with <b>applied</b> <b>forces</b> for both groups: male gender and greater subject body weight were associated with higher <b>applied</b> <b>forces,</b> and greater C 2 stiffness with lower forces. Having thumb pain was associated with lower <b>applied</b> <b>forces</b> for therapists but higher ones for students. Conclusions: students <b>apply</b> lower <b>forces</b> than therapists. Similar factors appear to affect <b>applied</b> <b>forces</b> regardless of clinical experience...|$|R

25|$|Elastic {{deformation}} in solids is {{reversible change}} in the internal molecular structure of an object. Stress does not necessarily cause permanent change. As deformation occurs, internal forces oppose the <b>applied</b> <b>force.</b> If the applied stress is not too large these opposing forces may completely resist the <b>applied</b> <b>force,</b> allowing the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original shape when the force is removed. This is known as elastic deformation or elasticity.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} asymptotics of the Stokes problem in {{cylinders}} becoming unbounded {{in the direction}} of their axis. First we assume that the <b>applied</b> <b>forces</b> are independent of the axis coordinate, then we assume that they are periodic along the axis of the cylinder. Finally in Section 4, we make an asymptotic analysis under much more general assumptions on the <b>applied</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|R
25|$|In these whistles, {{the flow}} {{instability}} is asymmetric, often resulting in rows of alternate vortices {{and the sound}} generation is associated with fluctuations of <b>applied</b> <b>force.</b> The sound field {{is as close to}} a dipole source as local geometry allows.|$|E
25|$|A greenstick {{fracture}} occurs due to {{mechanical failure}} on the tension side. That is, since the bone {{is not so}} brittle {{as it would be}} in an adult, it does not completely fracture, but rather exhibits bowing without complete disruption of the bone's cortex in the surface opposite the <b>applied</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
25|$|Plastic {{deformation}} in solids is an irreversible {{change in}} the internal molecular structure of an object. This change {{may be due to}} either (or both) an <b>applied</b> <b>force</b> or a change in temperature. The change of an object's shape is called strain. The force causing it is called stress.|$|E

50|$|The main {{difference}} in working principle {{between these two}} cases {{is the way they}} <b>apply</b> <b>forces</b> to the sensing elements. In a pressure sensor, a thin membrane transfers the force to the elements, while in accelerometers an attached seismic mass <b>applies</b> the <b>forces.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{pointing}} stick is an isometric joystick {{operated by}} <b>applied</b> <b>force</b> {{and is used}} as a pointing device on laptop computers. It {{takes the form of a}} rubber cap located on top of the keyboard embedded between the 'G', 'H' and 'B' keys. The pointing stick was invented by American computer scientist Ted Selker in 1984.|$|E
25|$|Axial {{precession}} {{is similar}} to the precession of a spinning top. In both cases, the <b>applied</b> <b>force</b> is due to gravity. For a spinning top, this force tends to be almost parallel to the rotation axis. For the Earth, however, the applied forces of the Sun and the Moon are nearly perpendicular to the axis of rotation.|$|E
25|$|Thus {{the speed}} of sound {{increases}} with the stiffness (the resistance of an elastic body to deformation by an <b>applied</b> <b>force)</b> of the material, and decreases with increase in density. For ideal gases the bulk modulus K is simply the gas pressure multiplied by the dimensionless adiabatic index, which is about 1.4 for air under normal conditions of pressure and temperature.|$|E

25|$|Agility is a {{characteristic}} of an organization or unit capable of swarming. Focus can be designation of a goal by a higher-level commander, by a peer unit detecting a target, or by intelligence systems that feed information to the swarming units. Convergence is the key feature, which, while it can be distributed, causes swarming units to coordinate their actions, <b>apply</b> <b>force,</b> and know when to stop <b>applying</b> <b>force.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{pressure}} transmitting {{medium is}} the compressible fluid that fills the sample chamber and transmits the <b>applied</b> <b>force</b> to the sample. Hydrostatic pressure is preferred for high-pressure experiments because variation in strain throughout the sample {{can lead to}} distorted observations of different behaviors. In some experiments stress and strain relationships are investigated {{and the effects of}} non-hydrostatic forces are desired. A good pressure medium will remain a soft, compressible fluid to high pressure.|$|E
25|$|An {{interior}} vortex of {{this type}} would explain why no frequency jumps occur. Since the excess fluid in the cavity must be discharged, the jet lateral movement must be considerably larger than that found in the edge tone; this is likely {{the reason for the}} high level sound. The flow over the edge results in an <b>applied</b> <b>force</b> and a dipole-like sound field. The characteristic speed must be U the jet exit speed. The characteristic dimension must be D, the cavity diameter.|$|E
25|$|There are two typical {{protocols}} of SMD: one {{in which}} pulling velocity is held constant, and {{one in which}} <b>applied</b> <b>force</b> is constant. Typically, part of the studied system (e.g., an atom in a protein) is restrained by a harmonic potential. Forces are then applied to specific atoms at either a constant velocity or a constant force. Umbrella sampling is used to move the system along the desired reaction coordinate by varying, for example, the forces, distances, and angles manipulated in the simulation. Through umbrella sampling, all of the system's configurations—both high-energy and low-energy—are adequately sampled. Then, each configuration's change in free energy can be calculated as the potential of mean force. A popular method of computing PMF is through the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM), which analyzes a series of umbrella sampling simulations.|$|E

25|$|Of decisive {{importance}} for the piezoelectric effect is the change of polarization P when applying a mechanical stress. This might either {{be caused by a}} reconfiguration of the dipole-inducing surrounding or by re-orientation of molecular dipole moments {{under the influence of the}} external stress. Piezoelectricity may then manifest in a variation of the polarization strength, its direction or both, with the details depending on: 1. the orientation of P within the crystal; 2. crystal symmetry; and 3. the applied mechanical stress. The change in P appears as a variation of surface charge density upon the crystal faces, i.e. as a variation of the electric field extending between the faces caused by a change in dipole density in the bulk. For example, a 1cm3 cube of quartz with 2kN (500lbf) of correctly <b>applied</b> <b>force</b> can produce a voltage of 12500 V.|$|E
25|$|For a bead sliding on a {{frictionless}} wire subject only {{to gravity}} in 2d space, the constraint on the bead can be {{stated in the}} form f(r) = 0, where {{the position of the}} bead can be written r = (x(s), y(s)), in which s is a parameter, the arc length s along the curve from some point on the wire. This is a suitable choice of generalized coordinate for the system. Only one coordinate is needed instead of two, because the position of the bead can be parameterized by one number, s, and the constraint equation connects the two coordinates x and y; either one is determined from the other. The constraint force is the reaction force the wire exerts on the bead to keep it on the wire, and the non-constraint <b>applied</b> <b>force</b> is gravity acting on the bead.|$|E
25|$|A {{derivative}} term {{does not}} consider the error (meaning it cannot bring it to zero: a pure D controller cannot bring the system to its setpoint), but {{the rate of change}} of error, trying to bring this rate to zero. It aims at flattening the error trajectory into a horizontal line, damping the force applied, and so reduces overshoot (error on the other side because too great <b>applied</b> <b>force).</b> Applying too much impetus when the error is small and is reducing will lead to overshoot. After overshooting, if the controller were to apply a large correction in the opposite direction and repeatedly overshoot the desired position, the output would oscillate around the setpoint in either a constant, growing, or decaying sinusoid. If the amplitude of the oscillations increase with time, the system is unstable. If they decrease, the system is stable. If the oscillations remain at a constant magnitude, the system is marginally stable.|$|E
