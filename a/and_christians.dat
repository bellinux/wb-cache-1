The Hardyz faced Edge <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> {{for the title}} at Insurrextion and {{defeated}} them by disqualification, which meant that Edge <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> retained the title.

5|$|The {{earliest}} documented Christian {{knowledge of}} Muhammad stems from Byzantine sources. They indicate that both Jews <b>and</b> <b>Christians</b> saw Muhammad as a false prophet. Another Greek source for Muhammad is Theophanes the Confessor, a 9th-century writer. The earliest Syriac source is the 7th-century writer John bar Penkaye.|$|E

5|$|After the Bar Kokhba revolt was crushed, Hadrian {{converted}} the Christian site above the Grotto into a shrine {{dedicated to the}} Greek god Adonis, to honour his favourite, the Greek youth Antinous. Some scholars hold the view that this site was one that had originally been dedicated to Adonis-Tammuz <b>and</b> <b>Christians</b> had taken it over.|$|E
5|$|Bethlehem paid {{taxes on}} wheat, barley and grapes. The Muslims <b>and</b> <b>Christians</b> were {{organized}} into separate communities, each having its own leader. Five leaders represented {{the village in}} the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population was slightly more prosperous or grew more grain than grapes (the former being a more valuable commodity).|$|E
5|$|Four {{centuries of}} {{stagnation}} during Ottoman rule {{came to an}} end during World War I by the 1916 Arab Revolt; driven by long-term Arab resentment towards the Ottoman authorities, and growing Arab nationalism. The revolt was launched by Sharif Hussein of Mecca, a member of the Hashemite clan of Hejaz who claim descent from Muhammad. Locally, the revolt garnered the support of the Transjordanian Bedouin tribes, Circassians <b>and</b> <b>Christians.</b> The Allies of World WarI, including Britain and France, offered support.|$|E

50|$|In Jewish <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> tradition, {{the love}} of money is {{condemned}} as a sin primarily based on texts such as Ecclesiastes 5.10 and 1 Timothy 6:10. The Jewish <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> condemnation relates to avarice and greed rather than money itself. The Jewish <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> texts (scriptures) are full of parables and use easy to understand subjects, such as money, to convey the actual message, there are further parallels in Solon and Aristotle, and Massinissa - who ascribed love of money to Hannibal and the Carthaginians.. Avarice {{is one of the}} Seven deadly sins in the Jewish <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> classifications of vices (sins).|$|R
5|$|Hindus, Muslims <b>and</b> <b>Christians</b> {{generally}} {{followed a}} joint family system. The society was largely patriarchal with the eldest male member {{the leader of}} the family.

5|$|However, {{the tenure}} of the Justice Party {{government}} of the Raja of Panagal is largely remembered for the introduction of caste-based reservations in 1921. In August 1921, the First communal Government Order (G.O. No.613) was passed. As per the order, 44 percent of jobs were reserved for non-Brahmins, 16 percent for Brahmins, 16 percent for Muslims, 16 percent for Anglo-Indians <b>and</b> <b>Christians</b> and eight percent for the Scheduled Castes.|$|E

5|$|Some {{philosophers}} <b>and</b> <b>Christians</b> {{resisted the}} demands of the body and the pleasures of food, and adopted fasting as an ideal. Food became simpler in general as urban life in the West diminished, trade routes were disrupted, and the rich retreated to the more limited self-sufficiency of their country estates. As an urban lifestyle came to be associated with decadence, the Church formally discouraged gluttony, and hunting and pastoralism were seen as simple, virtuous ways of life.|$|E

50|$|The fourth {{match was}} a tag team {{match for the}} WWF Tag Team Championship. Edge <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> defended the titles against Acolytes Protection Agency (Faarooq and Bradshaw). Prior to the match, Christian had been {{declared}} unable to compete due to food poisoning, but Commissioner Foley ordered the match to take place after discovering Christian's deception. As the match started, Acolytes started attacking Edge <b>and</b> <b>Christian.</b> Christian tried to attack a high-flying attack on Bradshaw but Bradshaw countered it by performing a Fallaway Slam. Acolytes continued to dominate the match and the big men overpowered Edge <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> throughout the match by using their size and strength and power moves until Edge hit Faarooq with the Tag Team Championship belt. As a result, Edge <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> were disqualified <b>and</b> retained the title as a title could not change hands on a disqualification. Acolytes attacked Edge <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> after the match and continued to attack them throughout the ringside area and the backstage area.|$|R
5|$|On the March 5, 2001 {{episode of}} Raw Is War, the Hardy Boyz {{captured}} their fourth Tag Team Championship when they defeated The Dudley Boyz, after interference from Christian, only {{to lose the}} titles to Edge <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> two weeks later on Raw. The next month at WrestleMania X-Seven, the Hardy Boyz competed in another TLC match against Edge <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>and</b> the Dudley Boyz.

5|$|Anekāntavāda {{played a}} role in the history of Jainism in India, during {{intellectual}} debates from Śaivas, Vaiṣṇavas, Buddhists, Muslims, <b>and</b> <b>Christians</b> at various times. According to John Koller, professor of Asian studies, anekāntavāda allowed Jain thinkers to maintain the validity of their doctrine, while at the same time respectfully criticizing the views of their opponents. In other cases, it was a tool used by Jaina scholars to confront and dispute Buddhist scholars in ancient India, or in the case of Haribhadra justify the retaliation of the killing of his two nephews by Buddhist monks, with capital punishment for all Buddhist monks in the suspected monastery, according to the Buddhist version of Haribhadra's biography.|$|E

5000|$|As Edge <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> complained, it was {{declared}} that Edge and Christian's title victory {{the previous night}} was official. At the same time, because the Hardy Boyz had just defeated the champions, commissioner Mick Foley ruled they were now the tag team champions. After being outsmarted by the Hardy Boyz, Edge <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> gave up the golden costumes of Los Conquistadors. In line with the stipulations of the prior ladder match, the ban on Edge <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> challenging for the championships had ended when [...] "Los Conquistadors" [...] defeated the Hardy Boyz' for the titles, so Edge <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> could wrestle for the titles again without disguises.|$|R
