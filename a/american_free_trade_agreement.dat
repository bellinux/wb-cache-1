5000|$|The Canada-US and North <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>agreements</b> (specifically Chapter 11 of NAFTA) have {{essentially}} removed most barriers to cross-border expansions and takeovers within North America, {{with a few}} notable exceptions. Most major sectors are highly integrated, with the most important companies working in all three countries. Sectors that were still not highly integrated in 2012 were healthcare, banking, telecoms, broadcasting, and airlines, largely because these areas have been [...] "ring-fenced" [...] within the agreements, or are subject to other legislative hurdles. In Mexico the energy sector is also ring-fenced by provisions in the Mexican constitution that protect the state oil company, Pemex, from privatization.

The paper exhaustively reviews services disciplines included in several <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Agreements</b> (FTA). The aim of the paper is to enable stakeholders to understand how rules and commitments regarding trade in services have been introduced in FTAs, and how those policies might impact sustainable development in developing countries. The paper starts by examining the main models used for agreements on services disciplines, namely the approaches deployed by the North <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Agreements</b> (NAFTA), the WTO General <b>Agreement</b> on <b>Trade</b> in Services (GATS) and the EU in form of the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). Unlike already existing research, this analysis goes beyond {{a discussion of the}} different mechanisms for liberalization (i. e. the negative and positive approach) thus introducing new groundbreaking research on services provisions in FTAs.

5|$|Canada's {{economic}} integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders {{to trade in}} the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada– United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Agreement</b> (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.|$|E

The accuracy of these reports has been debated by both the Obama campaign and the Canadian Government. The news came at a key time nearing the Ohio and Texas primaries, where perceptions among Democratic voters was (and is) that the benefits of the NAFTA agreement are dubious.

40|$|The primary {{distinction}} in a North-South trade accord {{is likely to}} be that the Southern nation experiences more capital scarcity than its Northern trade partner. So the trade accord's impact on the Southern trading partner's ability to attract capital may have welfare implications for both nations. The authors extend the traditional analysis of customs unions to allow for international capital movements. Their results indicate that trade accords may affect the ability of Southern nations to attract capital and may divert capital between Southern nations. Moreover, the welfare implications of North-South trade accords may differ from those that predict the North <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Agreement's</b> (NAFTA) minor third-country effects, holding factor endowments constant. The key implications of North-South trade accords such as NAFTA are generally perceived to involve their impact on investment flows. The authors try to understand the channels through which trade accords can affect North-South investment flows. A potential link between trade accords and investment flows may be how the accords affect the ability of the Southern partner government to make commitments about the treatment of foreign investment. They show that these accords can affect both the magnitude and pattern of inward foreign investment and production, implying the possibility that both trade and financial diversioncan stem from a bilateral regional trade accord. Novel effects that emerge under sovereign risk must be addressed when assessing the welfare implications of trade accords. The greatest gains from integration are still achieved when integration takes place between the countries with the greatest potential gains from trade. But the authors make a distinction: these gains now include both current trade and inter-temporal trade through foreign investment.

In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of the Congress {{for the first time}} in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D.

Clinton passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for matters related to a scandal that involved White House employee Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office. Clinton is only the second U.S. president to ever be impeached. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus, the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide an ex-ante assessment of the poverty and income distribution impacts of the Central <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Area <b>agreement</b> on Nicaragua. A general equilibrium macro model is used to simulate trade reform scenarios and estimate their price effects, while a micro-module maps these price changes into real income changes at the individual household level. A useful insight from this analysis is that even if the final total impact on poverty is not too large, its dispersion across households – due to their heterogeneity of factor endowments, inputs use, commodity production, and consumption preferences – is significant and should be taken into account when designing compensatory policies. Additionally, growth and redistribution decomposition shows that, at least in the short to medium run, redistribution can be as important as growth. The main policy message that emerges from the paper is that Nicaragua should consider enlarging its own liberalization to countries other than the U.

C. in collaboration with Jesuit social centers from around the world. This chapter: Jorge Enrique’s life changed dramatically when the tire factory where he worked, Euzkadi, shut down. Located in El Salto, Mexico, the factory was owned by a multinational company and in the past had had a strong labor union. It was a very good job for Jorge Enrique, with better wages and benefits than many other places in Mexico. But in 2001, the owners said that Mexico’s new lower import duties allowed cheaper foreign tires to enter the country and they couldn’t compete without concessions from labor. Now in his thirties, Jorge Enrique is involved with his union’s efforts to force the factory’s reopening. He wonders if he should go back to work in the United States, which he did when he was younger. It would be easy for him, because he has a “green card” − a legal entry visa. The old Mexican economic system crashed in 1982 under the weight of mounting international debt and fiscal deficits. It was a closed economy; domestic production was protected by high import tariffs and major industries were often in government hands. The immediate response to the crisis included severe economic austerity measures backed by loans from the IMF. This was followed by economic restructuring, particularly after 1988, marked by privatizations and liberalization of international trade and investment. Over the next decade, these measures were supported by Mexico’s implementing the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations and, in 1996, signing the North <b>American</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Area <b>Agreement</b> (NAFTA) with the U. S. and Canada. Mexico’s economic restructuring affected El Salto. Foreign companies made new investments − Continental Tire of Germany bought Euzkadi − and old plants, like the textile factory where Jorge Enrique’s father worked, had to close. In the country as a whole, the already ongoing migration to the U. S. accelerated as agriculture’s contribution to the economy fell by nearly two-thirds, down to 4 percent of GDP by 2000...|$|R
