25|$|Inspired by {{findings}} that the Amur tiger {{is the closest}} relative of the Caspian tiger, there has been discussion whether the Amur tiger could be an appropriate subspecies for reintroduction into a safe place in Central Asia. The Amu-Darya Delta was suggested as a potential site for such a project. A feasibility study was initiated to investigate if the area is suitable and if such an initiative would receive support from relevant decision makers. A viable tiger population of about 100 animals would require at least 5000km2 (1930sqmi) of large tracts of contiguous habitat with rich prey populations. Such habitat is not presently available in the Delta, and so cannot be provided in the short term. The proposed region is therefore unsuitable for the reintroduction, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> stage of development.|$|E

[...] Ology's Josh Harrison was also positive and gave the episode a rating of seven out of ten, while commenting that he [...] "thought this was a definite downgrade from the season premiere in terms of sheer comedic value, but the sincerity of Bart's educational experience, combined with the enthusiasm of his mad quest for justice, definitely made this one a winner." ...|$|E

Bassist Jeff Ament commented that he felt that love was a major theme of the album, and Vedder tried to convey themes such as love, loss and struggle to make a difference because of the difficulty in leading with events such as the September 11 attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival – [...] "You start feeling like, 'What do I have to say? What is my opinion?' Then I realized I did have an opinion. Not only did I have one, but I felt like it was formed by processing a lot of information and having good influences. Ament also told that [...] "I think the time's right to turn our voice up a bit [...] And Ed did it in a great way, with humour and a mystical, magical approach. It isn't just, 'We're pissed off, and fuck you! Riot! Anarchy!' Cos I don't think that's the method. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point." [...] Vedder, however, said, [...] "I have to admit this record came out a bit one-sided. But I think we as a country need to understand why we're involved in the Middle East. This hollow patriotism frightens me." [...] The singer added that the Riot Act lyrics [...] "represent my state of mind these days. I'm optimistic yet disillusioned, hopeful yet frustrated." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by Roskilde tragedy, with the album's first single, [...] "I Am Mine", being written by Vedder in 2000 in a hotel room before the band's first show after Roskilde, and [...] "Love Boat Captain" [...] including a brief lyrical reference ("Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today"). Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Bartlett's book The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil was published. The 200,000-word study {{applies the}} science of {{pathology}} to the human species {{in order to identify}} and describe many dispositionally-based pathologies that afflict our species, often without our awareness. A central purpose of the book is to bring together and discuss the work of twentieth century psychologists, psychiatrists, ethologists, psychologically-focused historians, and others who have studied the underlying psychology of human aggression and destructiveness. The conclusions of the study emphasize that human pathology has many originating factors, that people obtain varied cognitive and emotional gratifications from such pathology, and that human pathology is a normal human condition and is therefore generally intractable, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> stage of human development. Bartlett describes how deficits in what he defines as moral intelligence combine with the psychology of stupidity, which together form major contributors to the psychological shortcomings that result in human pathology. In critical responses to the book, the study was commended by The Journal of Analytical Psychology: [...] "Bartlett is a lucid, painstaking and illuminating writer. This is certainly a classic work of reference in the field." [...] The Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic appraised the book as [...] "a challenging and thought provoking approach that makes a significant contribution to an aspect of human psychopathology that is rarely or so comprehensively addressed." [...] About the book, M. Scott Peck commented: [...] "he study of evil is just beginning and you are a pioneer." [...] Eric Zillmer, Carl R. Pacifico Professor of Neuropsychology at Drexel University, commended the book: [...] "Steven James Bartlett's The Pathology of Man marks the most comprehensive examination of evil to date. Drawing from different fields of study, including psychology and epistemology, Bartlett sets out on a Tour de Force of delineating the parameters on human evil.... The resulting text is a most welcome addition to the field and provides for fascinating reading. The Pathology of Man is a timely, scholarly, and important piece of work that should appeal to anyone who is interested in understanding human evil." [...] Author and President of the Jewish Life Network Irving Greenberg commented: [...] "This book is stunning, upsetting, gripping.... he book is a moral act of the highest order. These...comments would be incomplete without mentioning the erudition, the intellectual insight and playfulness, the gallows humor and the self-restraint which deepen and lighten this book." [...] Since the publication of The Pathology of Man, Bartlett has published a series of further books and papers related to the same and related subjects.|$|E
