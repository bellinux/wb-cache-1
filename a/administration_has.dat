5|$|Modi was {{appointed}} Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001, due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi {{was elected to}} the legislative assembly soon after. His <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots, or otherwise criticised for its handling of it, although a court found no evidence to prosecute Modi. His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise. His <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty, and education indices in the state.|$|E

5|$|The <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> {{said earlier}} {{that it will be}} able to {{allocate}} different payment amounts to different people. To that end, in 2009, forms were distributed asking Iranians to report income, assets and property but the question remains on how the government will verify this information gathered by self-reporting. Many people have chosen not to report or withhold information. The <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> categorized the people into three income brackets; namely lower, middle, and higher for the implementation of the subsidy reform plan. On the other side, it was not clear in what form the compensation would be distributed, direct cash or goods. Another concern is the accuracy of government information on family incomes.|$|E

5|$|Forecasts ofhurricane {{activity}} are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University. A normal season, {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric <b>Administration,</b> <b>has</b> six to fourteen named storms, with four to eight of those reaching hurricane strength, and one to three major hurricanes. The 1994forecast predicted that a total of 10storms would form, of which six of the storms would reach hurricane status. The forecast also projected that three of the hurricanes would reach major hurricane status.|$|E

5|$|The National Rail <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> {{developed}} {{a plan for}} possible expansion of the commuter rail. The main possibilities have been discussed: rebuilding the section from Sandnes to Egersund to double track, taking back into use the Ålgård Line, which branches off at Ganddal, and building a new branch from south of Gausel to Stavanger Airport, Sola. An alternative to several of the options is a light rail, {{which may or may}} not be built as a tram-train, which would use parts of the existing double track between Stavanger and Sandnes.|$|E
5|$|The National Rail <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> {{stated that}} they may have to close Innherred Sykehus Station. The station is located in a curve and within the {{signaling}} area of Levanger Station, and the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate has required the station to be corrected by 2012. Because of the adjacent Levanger Hospital, the station is one of the busiest on the system, with 90,000 annual riders. One possible solution is to move the platforms of Levanger Station closer towards the hospital and thus serve both the town and the hospital from the same station.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian National Rail <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> {{proposed}} {{a number of}} upgrades to the Bergen Line that would allow total travel time between the termini to reduce to {{four and a half}} hours. The Ringerike Line is seen as the hallmark of this attempt, that was first launched by the director of NSB in 1954; sixty years later travel time remains at six and a half hours. The project is estimated to cost NOK 7 billion, of which NOK 4 billion would be for the line.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} {{presented}} {{as part of the}} original proposal of the Bergen Line when approved by Parliament in 1894, but due to the narrow gauge on the Drammen Line at the time, a temporary solution via Roa was chosen instead. Later proposals have been launched, and parliament has voted over it in 1954, 1978, 1984 and 1992; only the last being passed, but not followed up by funding, and the Norwegian National Rail <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> not allocated any date to start construction; detailed plans have however been produced.|$|E
5|$|The Østfold Line is {{the railway}} that connects Norway to Continental Europe, and 80% of all land-based, {{international}} freight transport goes through Østfold. Until the Follo Line opens, there cannot be a capacity increase on international freight trains to Norway. The Rail <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> {{set a goal}} of tripling the amount of rail freight by 2040, which for the South Corridor is equal to the removal of 750 trucks per day from European Route E18. The Follo Line will also allow freight trains to pass during rush hour.|$|E

The Asian Development Bank notes that, although the <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms, {{in the absence of an}} alternative to phosphate mining, the medium-term outlook is for continued dependence on external assistance. Tourism is not a major contributor to the economy.|$|E

5|$|With the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and Istanbul Province having {{equivalent}} jurisdictions, few responsibilities {{remain for}} the provincial government. Similar to the MMI, the Istanbul Special Provincial <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> a governor, a democratically elected decision-making body—the Provincial Parliament—and an appointed Executive Committee. Mirroring {{the executive committee}} at the municipal level, the Provincial Executive Committee includes a secretary-general and leaders of departments that advise the Provincial Parliament. The Provincial Administration's duties are largely limited to the building and maintenance of schools, residences, government buildings, and roads, {{and the promotion of}} arts, culture, and nature conservation. Hüseyin Avni Mutlu has been Governor of Istanbul Province since May 2010.|$|E
5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly {{all aspects of the}} trucking industry. Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol. States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In some states, trucks also have special speed limits, in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes (normally the far right lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> {{denied that}} devaluing their {{currency}} {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E
