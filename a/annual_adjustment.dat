In 1948-1949 substantial share of Marshall Plan funds allocated to Austria {{was used to}} subsidize imports of food. American money, effectively, raised real wages of Austrian workers: grain price in Austria was at {{about one-third of the}} world price. Farmers were depressed by artificially low prices; the Americans were not happy about it too and planned to cut off food subsidies by the end of 1950. Austrian coalition government chaired by Leopold Figl was facing an impending social and economic crisis. They had to manage it alone, without allied support and without financial reserves to smooth the transition. Austrian finances were ruined by post-war hyperinflation.

50|$|To {{reach this}} figure {{a more general}} formula is {{employed}} that simplifies its calculation. The starting point is a basis that takes account of: State expenditure in Spain on untransferred powers; what the State collects due to income {{not included in the}} agreement; and, {{in order to avoid the}} quota representing an extra burden over and above the generation of effective resources of the State, the deficit. A proportion of this expenditure and income had to be assigned to the Basque Country. Through an approximate calculation, which takes account of the weight of the income and population within the Spanish total, it was stipulated that the proportion was 6.24%. The Quota has a five-yearly periodicity, although there is an <b>annual</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the quantity on the basis of the figures budgeted for and liquidated by the State. This is an essential difference from the design of the Quota up until that time, inasmuch as it involves the unilateral risk represented for the Basque Country of assuming a part of the expenditure on powers that have not been transferred and that depend exclusively on the State, independent of how the conjuncture of the country evolves or whether the tax collection increases or not.|$|E

30|$|To {{assess the}} {{magnitude}} of the adjustment costs associated with the average wage, the model’s parameters are estimated. The estimates reveal that labor quality, inferred indirectly from the data on employment, wage bill, and revenue, is an important input of production. Furthermore, there are statistically and economically significant asymmetric adjustment costs. When only the continuing plants are considered, the mean annual cost of average-wage adjustment in any direction constitutes up to 1.6 % of a plant’s revenue at the median of the adjustment cost distribution. For plants adjusting their average wage downwards, the <b>annual</b> <b>adjustment</b> cost claims, on average, up to 3.6 % of revenue. For plants adjusting their average wage upwards, the <b>annual</b> <b>adjustment</b> cost makes up as much as 0.8 % of revenue on average. These shares are much higher when only the exiting plants are considered. A version of the model with both the average-wage and employment adjustment costs is also estimated. A plant {{may not be able to}} adjust its average wage holding employment constant. Similarly, changes in employment can induce changes in the average wage due to changes in the composition of a plant’s labor force. Allowing for both channels of adjustment addresses potential biases due to using only one.|$|E
