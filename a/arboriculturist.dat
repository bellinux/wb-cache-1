5000|$|A {{person who}} {{practices}} or studies arboriculture can be termed an 'arborist' or an 'arboriculturist'. A 'tree surgeon' is more typically {{someone who is}} trained in the physical maintenance and manipulation of trees and therefore more {{a part of the}} arboriculture process rather than an arborist. Risk management, legal issues, and aesthetic considerations have come to play prominent roles in the practice of arboriculture. Businesses often need to hire <b>arboriculturists</b> to complete [...] "tree hazard surveys" [...] and generally manage the trees on-site to fulfill occupational safety and health obligations.|$|R

50|$|In 2014, Sutton {{published}} an e-book, Nullius in Verba: Darwin’s Greatest Secret, alleging that Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace plagiarised {{the theory of}} natural selection from Scottish grain merchant and <b>arboriculturist</b> Patrick Matthew. Matthew had published On Naval Timber and Arboriculture in 1831, twenty-eight years before Darwin's On the Origin of Species. When challenged by Matthew writing to a Gardeners' periodical, Darwin claimed that neither he, nor any naturalist he knew, had read Matthew's work. Sutton rejects this claim, identifying seven naturalists who cited the book before 1858, and that three of those (John Claudius Loudon, Prideaux John Selby and Robert Chambers) were well known to Darwin and his associates. He also analysed similarities between Darwin's, Wallace's and Matthew's writings, particularly unpublished essays by Darwin, and Wallace's 1855 Sarawak paper, that was published in a journal edited by Selby. Sutton points out that Loudon was the editor of two influential papers on species and variety written by Blyth, and that Chambers wrote, anonymously, the influential Vestiges of Creation. Sutton has not explained how the relevance of this to telling Darwin and Wallace of Matthew's ideas, especially as each of those editors stated they did not understand Matthew's ideas, or rejected them. Additionally, the paucity of evidence throughout means Sutton has no basis for his claims, each having been deconstructed at Natural Histories. Sutton has yet to respond.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the {{transition}} from a production nursery to the landscape, the percentage survival of woody trees and shrubs is sometimes small due to limited root growth. It is important to nurserymen and <b>arboriculturists</b> that proper fertility programs be determined that will maintain a proper balance in growth between shoots and roots. Studies with Cotoneaster divaricata showed that root growth was not increased by N ad-dition up to 500 mg/l of soil mix. High N levels actually had negative effects on root growth, whereas P slightly stimulated growth. Mycorrhizal inoculation of Liriodendron tulipifera did not promote root or shoot growth without application of fer-tilizer. The impetus for these studies came from popular promotion of containerized plants for use in street plantings and as major components in ur...|$|R

In 1884-85 the revenue of British India was Rs. 70,69,06,810, of which the land-tax yielded Rs. 21,83,22,110; Rs. 8,81,64,690 were derived from opium, and Rs. 98,69,840 from forest. In that year 22,425 human beings were killed by elephants, tigers, leopards, wolves, bears, hyenas, and venomous snakes; and of cattle killed the number was 49,987.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{evidence}} base that documents the social, environmental and economic beneﬁts that urban trees can deliver. Trees are, however, under threat today as never before due to competition for space imposed by development, other hard infrastructures, increased pressure {{on the availability of}} ﬁnancial provision from local authorities and a highly cautious approach to risk management in a modern litigious society. It is, therefore, incumbent upon all of us in construction and urban design disciplines to pursue a set of goals that not only preserve existing trees where we can, but also ensure that new plantings are appropriately speciﬁed and detailed to enable their successful establishment and growth to productive maturity. Aimed at developers, urban planners, urban designers, landscape architects and <b>arboriculturists,</b> this book takes a candid look at the beneﬁts that trees provide alongside the threats that are eliminating them from our towns and cities. It takes a simple, applied approach that explores a combination of science and practical experience to help ensure a pragmatic and reasoned approach to decision-making in terms of tree selection, speciﬁcation, placement and establishment. In this way, trees can be successfully incorporated within our urban landscapes, so that we can continue to reap the beneﬁts they provide...|$|R
30|$|Concerns {{about public}} safety and urban tree {{conservation}} strongly support the development and application of rapid, precise, and cost efficient diagnostic techniques to detect decay {{and other types of}} structural defects in trees [1]. Standing trees must be evaluated to maintain in situ structural safety for tree risk assessment. Various nondestructive techniques (NDT) have been applied to detect decay and deterioration in trees to identify hazardous trees. NDT is the science of identifying the physical and mechanical properties of a piece of material without altering its end-use capabilities and then using this information to make decisions regarding appropriate applications [2]. Visual tree assessment, a systematic method of tree assessment using biological and biomechanical indicators to evaluate overall vitality and structural integrity of a tree, includes visual inspection of the tree to look for external evidence of internal defects, instrumental measurements of internal defects and evaluation of the residual strength of the wood [3]. <b>Arboriculturists</b> consider visual tree assessment (i.e., structural defects) an essential practice. This kind of assessment serves as the starting point for evaluating tree defects and providing basic information about tree growth performance and stability. Tree breakage depends on many features of the tree, including its height, width of crown, crown architecture, crown density in the branching and leaves, form, condition, physical wood properties, and species [4].|$|R
40|$|Urban {{development}} in Hong Kong {{has left a}} tightly-packed town plan with little intervening space for trees. Limitation of available land {{in relation to a}} large population underscores the fundamental constraint. The planting tradition adopted since the founding of the city some 150 years ago was implemented when the urban matrix was still relatively porous. Recent intensification of development has imposed increasing pressure on the meagre tree stock. Pervasive shortage of plantable space is aggravated by its poor quality which deteriorates with land-use changes. Setting back building lots for amenity planting, if applied on a large scale, should bring permeation of greenery. Existing roadside and offroad habitats, including areas containing high-calibre specimen trees and woodland plots, are often lost to vehicular-traffic infrastructure and other community needs. Proliferation of underground utilities restricts chances for roadside trees. Frequent trenching to repair buried services and recently to install a territory-wide cable-television and communication network brings havoc to roots, and premature decline. Soils at planting sites, especially at roadsides, are beset by problems such as: shallowness, too many boulders and stones, excessively coarse texture, compaction, nutrient deficiency, alkaline reaction and pollution. Outmoded nursery practice, ineffective quality control, and lack of research on suitable cultivars have allowed widespread use of substandard planting materials. Whereas trained <b>arboriculturists</b> are employed by the government to look after public trees, the shortage of expertise and professionalism in the private sector degrades the quality of tree work. The poor match between species selection and planting-site conditions, and a large backlog of surgery work need to be addressed. Preservation efforts are not commensurate with the scarcity of outstanding trees, with worthwhile ones continually lost due mainly to construction activities. Transplanting, the protection of champion trees and those dwelling on old stone walls should be more earnestly adopted measures. The community needs to modify its rather apathetic attitude towards urban trees and furnish effective statutory measures to plan, plant and preserve trees to effect long-term improvement. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
