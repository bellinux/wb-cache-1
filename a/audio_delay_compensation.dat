The use of vanadium SPNDs are limited to 3 -D flux mapping despite of providing better Signal to Noise Ratio as compared to other prompt SPNDs, due to their small prompt component in the signal.

Consistent with previous studies of auditory-visual speech recognition which showed a broad, asymmetrical range of temporal synchrony (<b>audio</b> <b>delays</b> roughly between- 40 ms and + 240 ms) for which intelligibility was basically unaffected, synchrony discrimination thresholds also showed a broad, asymmetrical pattern of similar magnitude (<b>audio</b> <b>delays</b> roughly between- 45 ms and 200 ms).
