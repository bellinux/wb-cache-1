As Maya society developed, and the elite became more powerful, Maya royalty developed their household shrines into the great pyramids that held the tombs of their ancestors.|$|E

5|$|The idea of Masonic brotherhood {{probably}} descends from a 16th-century {{legal definition}} of a brother as one who has taken an oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law. In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a Volume of Sacred Law, whichever book of divine revelation is <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In Progressive continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are permissible, a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges.|$|E

5|$|Weber's most {{influential}} work was on economic sociology, political sociology, and {{the sociology of}} religion. Along with Karl Marx and Émile Durkheim, he is commonly {{regarded as one of}} the founders of modern sociology. But whereas Durkheim, following Comte, worked in the positivist tradition, Weber was instrumental in developing an antipositivist, hermeneutic, tradition in the social sciences. In this regard he belongs to a similar tradition as his German colleagues Werner Sombart, Georg Simmel, and Wilhelm Dilthey, who stressed the differences between the methodologies <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> social and the natural sciences.|$|E
5|$|Clergy of the Church of England {{who were}} not bishops {{historically}} bore arms identical to a layman, with a shield, helm and crest, and no ecclesiastical hat. In England in 1976 a system for deans, archdeacons and canons was authorized by the College of Arms, allowing a black ecclesiastical hat, black or violet cords, and three violet or red tassels on each side. A priest uses {{a black and white}} cord with a single tassel on each side, and a deacon a hat without tassels. A Doctor of Divinity may have cords interwoven with red and a hat <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> degree, and members of the Ecclesiastical Household add a Tudor rose {{on the front of the}} hat. According to Boutell's Heraldry, this system represents the practice of the Church in England in the 16th century.|$|E

Wilson explained that Bolivia was <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plot, because of the country's history of water problems, and was surprised the two countries disliked each other a century after the War of the Pacific. In a poll by Chilean daily newspaper La Segunda, 75% of its readers disagreed with Lopez's actions, due to the negative image of Chile they felt it presented, and the controversy's potential to put off productions looking to film {{in the country in}} the future.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{compounds}} built within the rova by successive Merina rulers bears distinct architectural styles that reflect the dramatic changes experienced in Imerina over {{the reign of the}} 19th century Kingdom of Madagascar, which saw the arrival and rapid expansion of European influence at the royal court. The site contains a blend of traditional Merina and European styles and construction methods. The predominant architectural features and layout of the royal city follow the traditional model of rova construction that predominated in the Highlands from the 15th century. Following tradition, the homes of the living are constructed of wood and vegetation (living materials), while the tombs of the dead are built in stone (cold, inert material). The selection of specific wood and plant materials used in construction, each of which were imbued with distinct symbolic meaning, reflected traditional social norms and spiritual beliefs. Since 1996, many of the buildings have undergone restoration using traditional materials and construction practices <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> era in which the buildings were first erected.|$|E
5|$|Features on Io {{are named}} after {{characters}} and places from the Io myth, {{as well as}} deities of fire, volcanoes, the Sun, and thunder from various myths, and characters and places from Dante's Inferno: names <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> volcanic nature of the surface. Since the surface was first seen up close by Voyager 1, the International Astronomical Union has approved 225 names for Io's volcanoes, mountains, plateaus, and large albedo features. The approved feature categories used for Io for different types of volcanic features include patera ("saucer"; volcanic depression), fluctus ("flow"; lava flow), vallis ("valley"; lava channel), and active eruptive center (location where plume activity was {{the first sign of}} volcanic activity at a particular volcano). Named mountains, plateaus, layered terrain, and shield volcanoes include the terms mons, mensa ("table"), planum, and tholus ("rotunda"), respectively. Named, bright albedo regions use the term regio. Examples of named features are Prometheus, Pan Mensa, Tvashtar Paterae, and Tsũi Goab Fluctus.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E

5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come.

Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E
