40|$|The {{research}} in this PhD thesis is motivated by the importance of precise microflow control in transforming various laboratory-based chemical and clinical assays into portable centrifugal microfluidics based devices. The more specific aim {{is the development of}} inexpensive flow control and liquid routing techniques {{that can be used in}} sample preparative processes such as blood plasma separation, washing, metering, and analyte detection. Efficient and inexpensive flow control techniques based on new principles and operations are introduced and compared with state of the art industrial approaches. Unlike previously introduced techniques these novel flow control methods are not dependent on the direction of the disk rotation and do not require special surface treatments or external power sources. The hardware to enable these techniques is easy to implement and provides robust control of the flow in centrifugal microfluidic platforms. Prior to designing new <b>capillary</b> <b>valves,</b> a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between contact angles and capillary dimensions on the performance of passive <b>capillary</b> <b>valves</b> was carried out. The results reveal, for example, that square capillaries have lower capillary forces compared to rectangular capillaries. The results also show that -contrary to earlier theoretical predictions- the capillary force at burst valves dramatically drops when the contact angle decreases. For the first time, a new valving technique is introduced that exploits a geometrical effect on the surface tension to control and switch the flow direction. The valve is a frequency dependent device that is able to direct the flow to one direction (e. g., c. w.) at low frequencies and to the opposite direction (e. g., c. c. w.) at higher frequencies without using external power sources or applying surface treatments. The flow behavior of the new valve for distilled water as well as for liquids with different properties was investigated experimentally and numerically. The results show that the new valve is v able to control the flow direction on a spinning microfluidic platform for liquids of widely varying properties. Another novel microvalve is presented that allows for the efficient routing of samples, switching and controlling the flow direction on centrifugal microfluidic platforms. The distinctive feature that makes this approach different from other types of passive <b>capillary</b> <b>valves</b> is the robust control of liquid movement, which is achieved by employing two adjustable sequential burst valves i. e., a primary and a secondary burst valve. The performance of this novel configuration was experimentally tested, the flow behavior was numerically studied using the VOF method and a theoretical model for their burst frequency was presented. For the first time, the role of the effective moment of inertia of the liquid in centrifugal microfluidics – that can be used for pushing the liquid towards specific lateral or/and radial directions – was theoretically, experimentally and numerically investigated. The experiment results confirmed that utilizing the effective moment of inertia of the liquid i. e., as a result of a sudden reduction of the rotational speed (45 Hz/s), propels the entire liquid volume from a chamber adjacent to the disc’s periphery to a chamber close to the disc center...|$|R

40|$|Summary A {{theoretical}} {{treatment of}} some of the factors in-fluencing air seeding at the pit membranes of xylem vessels is given. Pit membrane structure, viewed as a three-dimensional mesh of intercrossing fibrils, and vulnerability to water-stress-induced air seeding are examined {{in the context of the}} Young-Laplace equation. Simple geometrical considerations of the porous membrane show that the vapor–liquid interface curva-ture radius is a function of fiber–fiber distance, fiber radius, wetting angle and position of the wetting line. Air seeding (maximum pressure) occurs at the minimum curvature radius, therefore air seeding is not simply determined by the fiber–fi-ber distance but is a function of the geometry of the pit mem-brane and of physicochemical quantities like surface tension and wetting angle. As a consequence of considering a wetting angle different from zero, the minimum curvature radius be-comes larger than half the fiber–fiber distance. The present model considers that, for a given pressure difference at the pit membrane, all local interface curvatures are the same. In this sense, pit membranes work as variable <b>capillary</b> <b>valves</b> that al-low or prevent air seeding by adjusting local curvatures and in-terface positions relative to the pore-forming fibers, following the pressure differences across the membranes. The theoretical prediction for the air seeding threshold is consistent with recent experimental data for angiosperm trees...|$|R

Determining and switching the flow direction at a T-junction is a common fluidic operation important for implementing several chemical and clinical assays for Lab-on-CDs. The present work describes a novel approach to route samples and control flow direction on a spinning disc that employs a guiding microstructure that relies on a two-stage valve comprised of an auxiliary inlet, which is a recess embedded at a T-junction, and a bent auxiliary outlet. The distinctive feature that makes this approach different from other types of passive <b>capillary</b> <b>valves</b> is the strong control of liquid movement, which is achieved by employing two adjustable sequential burst valves called a primary valve and a secondary burst valve.

The technique also allows for the switching of the flow direction instantaneously from the direction along the disc rotation to the opposite direction by increasing the rotational speed of the disc rather than relying on the Coriolis force, which would require reversing the spin direction.

This thesis presents {{the development of}} reversible microballoon pump, mixer and valve that enhance the control over the manipulation of liquids in bioanalytical assay on centrifugal microfluidic platforms. The high elasticity of the microballoon allows for an efficient conversion of centrifugally and externally induced forces to pumping, mixing and valving forces. The first liquid handling element presented in this thesis is a microballoon pump that relies on elastic energy stored in a latex membrane. It operates at low rotational speeds (< 1500 rpm) and pumps various liquid volumes towards {{the centre of the}} CD. The second presented liquid handling element is a microballoon mixer that operates by the expansion and relaxation of the membrane to provide for a consistent periodical 3 D reciprocating flow. The third presented microballoon liquid handling element is a reversible thermo-pneumatic valve (RTPV) that seals or reopens an inlet when a trapped air volume is heated or cooled, respectively. It employs the deflection of a latex membrane to control liquid flow and prevent evaporation of reagents over a wide range of spinning speeds (up to 6000 rpm) and temperatures (up to the operational temperature of the disk materials), respectively.

The prototype has been tested by fluorescence dye 5 -Carboxyfluorescein ( 5 -FAM) dissolved into the solvent DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide). The results prove a remarkable sensitivity at a pico-scale molar, around 1. 08 pM. The low-cost and miniaturized optical detection system, with a self-control capillary-driven microfluidic chip developed in this work, {{can be used as}} the crucial parts in portable biochemical detection applications and point of care testing...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the design, fabrication, and testing process for a microfluidic phosphate colorimeter utilized for water quality analysis. The device can be powered by, and interfaced {{for data collection}} with, a common cell phone or laptop to dramatically reduce costs. Unlike commercially available colorimeters, this device {{does not require the}} user to measure or mix sample and reagent. A disposable poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluid chip, powered by an absorption pumping mechanism, was used to draw water samples, mix the sample at a specific ratio with a molybdovanadate reagent, and load both fluids into an onboard cuvette for colorimetric analysis. A series of <b>capillary</b> retention <b>valves,</b> channels, and diffusion pumping surfaces passively controls the microfluidic chip so that no user input is required. The microfluidic chip was fabricated using a modified SU- 8 soft lithography process to produce a 1. 67 mm light absorbance pathlength for optimal Beer Lambert Law color absorbance. Preliminary calibration curves for the device produced from standard phosphate solutions indicate a range of detection between 5 to 30 mg/L for reactive orthophosphate with a linearity of R²= 91. 3 % and precision of 2. 6 ppm. The performance of the PDMS absorption driven pumping process was investigated using flow image analysis and indicates an effective pumping rate up to approximately 7 µL/min to load a 36 µL sample...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} developed to predict the steady-state performance of vapor compression automobile air conditioners and heat pumps. The code {{is based on the}} residential heat pump model developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Most calculations are based on fundamental physical principles, in conjunction with generalized correlations available in the research literature. Automobile air conditioning components that can be specified as inputs to the program include open and hermetic compressors; finned tube condensers; finned tube and plate-fin style evaporators; thermal expansion <b>valve,</b> <b>capillary</b> tube and short tube expansion devices; refrigerant mass; evaporator pressure regulator; and all interconnecting tubing. The program can be used with a variety of refrigerants, including R 134 a. Methodologies are discussed for using the model as a tool for designing all new systems or, alternatively, as a tool for simulating a known system for a variety of operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{work for}} the first time {{presents}} the full integration and automation concept for a range of bioassays leveraged by cascading a centrifugo-pneumatic valving scheme to sequentially move several liquids through shared channel segments for multi-step sample preparation into the detection zone. This novel centrifugo-pneumatic liquid handling significantly simplifies system manufacture by obviating the need for complex surface functionalization procedures or hybrid material integration, as it is common in conventional valving methods such as <b>capillary</b> burst <b>valves</b> or sacrificial valves. Based on the centrifugo-pneumatic valving scheme, this work presents a toolkit of operational elements implementing liquid loading/transfer, metering, mixing and sedimentation in a microstructured polymer disc. As a proof of concept for the broad class of homogeneous bioassays, the full integration and automation of a colorimetric nitrate/nitrite test for the detection of clinically relevant nitric oxide (NO) in whole blood is implemented. First, 40 µL of plasma is extracted from a 100 µL sample of human blood, incubated for one hour with the enzymatic mixture (60 µL), and finally reacted with 100 µL of colorimetric (Greiss) reagents. Following just a single loading phase {{at the beginning of the}} process, all of these steps are automated through the centrifugo-pneumatic cascade with a high level of flow control and synchronization. Our system shows good correlation with controls up to 50 µM of nitrate, which adequately covers the healthy human range (4 to 45. 3 µM) ...|$|R
40|$|Direct analysis, {{with minimal}} sample pretreatment, of {{antidepressant}} drugs, fluoxetine, imipramine, desipramine, amitriptyline, and nortriptyline in biofluids was developed {{with a total}} run time of 8 min. The setup consists of two HPLC pumps, injection <b>valve,</b> <b>capillary</b> RAM-ADS-C 18 pre-column and a capillary analytical C 18 column connected {{by means of a}} six-port valve in backflush mode. Detection was performed with ESI-MS/MS and only 1 mu m of sample was injected. Validation was adequately carried out using FLU-d(5) as internal standard. Calibration curves were constructed under a linear range of 1 - 250 ng mL(- 1) in plasma, being the limit of quantification (LOQ), determined as 1 ng mL(- 1), for all the analytes. With the described approach it was possible to reach a quantified mass sensitivity of 0. 3 pg for each analyte (equivalent to 1. 1 - 1. 3 fmol), translating to a lower sample consumption (in the order of 103 less sample than using conventional methods).

50|$|Mechanical {{heat pumps}} exploit the {{physical}} properties of a volatile evaporating and condensing fluid {{known as a}} refrigerant. The heat pump compresses the refrigerant to make it hotter on the side to be warmed, and releases the pressure at the side where heat is absorbed. The working fluid, in its gaseous state, is pressurized and circulated through the system by a compressor. On the discharge side of the compressor, the now hot and highly pressurized vapor is cooled in a heat exchanger, called a condenser, until it condenses into a high pressure, moderate temperature liquid. The condensed refrigerant then passes through a pressure-lowering device also called a metering device. This may be an expansion <b>valve,</b> <b>capillary</b> tube, or possibly a work-extracting device such as a turbine. The low-pressure liquid refrigerant then enters another heat exchanger, the evaporator, in which the fluid absorbs heat and boils. The refrigerant then returns to the compressor and the cycle is repeated.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} the design, numerical simulation, fabrication and characterization of a label-free optofluidic refractive index sensor {{that is based}} on air-suspended SU‐ 8 grating couplers. By exploiting a polymer-onto-polymer lamination method for thin structured SU‐ 8 films, waveguide grating couplers can be fabricated in a film on top of a microfluidic channel system. A <b>capillary</b> force <b>valve,</b> integrated into the microchannels, precisely positions the employed test analytes, which are different DI water based sugar solutions, below the sensing grating coupler. By performing numerical simulations, the sensing grating coupler is optimized to a center wavelength of 1550 nm in the case that pure DI water (n = 1. 33) is applied to the microfluidic channel. When a supported mode, guided in the waveguide, reaches the sensing grating region, it is exposed to the test solution resulting in a change of the effective refractive index of the mode. Similar to the simulation results, the experimental characterization of the sensor structure demonstrates a refractive index sensitivity of approximately 400 nm per refractive index unit (RIU) with respect to the wavelength shift of the grating coupler response, and 17 dB RIU ‐ 1 with respect to the intensity decrease at the individual center wavelengths for refractive index variations between n = 1. 33 and n = 1. 36. Due to the combination of microfluidic channels and air-suspended grating couplers, analytes can directly be probed in-line in an integrated microfluidic channel making the presented principle suitable for low-cost, in-line polymer optofluidic and photonic sensing applications...|$|R
