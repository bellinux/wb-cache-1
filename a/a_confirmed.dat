5|$|Dr. Charles Kroger (Stanley Kamel) {{arrives at}} his office and finds Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) and Harold Krenshaw (Tim Bagley) arguing over who should get the {{following}} session. They enter the office and find Teresa Mueller (Lisa Dempsey), the building's cleaning lady, dead, {{and some of the}} patient files scattered. Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) suspect that one of Dr. Kroger's patients was responsible. Dr. Kroger says it can be Joseph Wheeler (Kevin Fry), who threatened him in the past. Dr. Kroger blames himself for not predicting the murder, and decides to retire. Wheeler, however, is dismissed as a suspect as he has <b>a</b> <b>confirmed</b> alibi.|$|E
5|$|Joseph died in February 1790 and {{was soon}} succeeded by his brother Leopold II. Leopold, himself <b>a</b> <b>confirmed</b> liberal, made an {{armistice}} with the Turks and withdrew 30,000 troops to repress the rebellion in Brabant. On 27 July 1790, Leopold signed the Reichenbach Convention with Prussia which allowed the Emperor to begin the reconquest of the Austrian Netherlands as long as its local traditions were respected. An amnesty was offered to all revolutionaries who surrendered to the Austrian forces.|$|E

5|$|More {{was indicted}} by the Grand Inquest for the County of Washington, during its July term, for taking {{unlawful}} fees {{for his services}} as a justice of the peace. The indictment charged More with having taken the fees on July 17 and 24. A capias, returnable at the December 1802 term, was issued. The members of the Inquest included five other D.C. justices of the peace: Daniel Carrol, Daniel Reintzell, Joseph Sprigg Belt, Thomas Corcoran, and Anthony Reintzell. Another member of the Inquest was Thomas Beall, <b>a</b> <b>confirmed</b> Adams appointee who had not received a commission from Jefferson.|$|E
5|$|One of the wrecks was rediscovered in 1964. A private company, Platoro, Ltd., {{began to}} {{excavate}} the Espíritu Santo wreck in late 1967, which caused public outrage and {{the passage of}} new laws to protect wrecks on the Texan coast. The remains of San Esteban were found in 1970 and excavated in 1972–73. Many artifacts have been recovered and are held in the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History. They include the world's oldest mariner's astrolabe with <b>a</b> <b>confirmed</b> date.|$|E

5|$|Another related {{investigation}} {{involved the}} fate of the children of captured pregnant guerrillas, who were given up for adoption by the military junta. An estimated 500 children were involved. The investigation became controversial during the Kirchner administration, as those involved had become adults and some of them refused to participate in DNA testing. One of those cases was the Noble siblings case, involving the adopted sons of Ernestina Herrera de Noble, owner of the Clarín newspaper. The Kirchners advanced a bill in Congress to make the genetic testing of suspected victims mandatory. Although the measure had popular support, critics considered it a breach of the right to privacy, and politically motivated because of a dispute between Kirchner and the Clarín newspaper. The Noble siblings tests in 2011 were negative, and the case was closed in January 2016, after Kirchner left the presidency. Hilario Bacca, <b>a</b> <b>confirmed</b> son of disappeared guerrillas, appealed a judicial ruling that sought to change his name, asking to keep the name he had been using.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before any}} {{construction}} work {{had started the}} cost of the forts had been estimated to exceed the previous calculations by fifty percent. In December 1901, only few months after the first blasting work that had been done at Gammelängsberget in July 1901, the cost for the four forts northeast of the river was expected to be sixty-five percent more expensive than the initial calculation. The blueprints of the forts at Degerberget, Gammelängsberget and Södra Åberget were the first to be confirmed, which happened on 11 May 1901. The fort at Mjösjöberget followed suit on 3 April 1902 and the last fort to get <b>a</b> <b>confirmed</b> blueprint was the fort at Rödberget, on 19 May 1903. The last proposed fort, at Paglaberget, was deleted from the plans in 1906along with the batteries at Fällberget and Slumpberget as well as the fortifications at Avan and Svartbyträsketbefore any work on the fort had started, due to the proposal of the new Fortification Committee of 1905, which was formed following the reports of the large rise in costs. On 9 February 1906, the current Minister for War Lars Tingsten calculated the total cost to end at 19,220,000 kronor, more than twice the cost reported by the 1897 committee.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} inauguration, Jefferson {{instructed}} his Secretary of State, James Madison, to stop delivery on all outstanding commissions. Further, {{an act of}} March 8, 1802 the abolished the circuit court judgeships created by the Midnight Judges Act (15 of which had already been filled), restoring the system created under the 1789 and 1793 acts. Federalists viewed this as unconstitutional and looked to the then-pending case of Marbury v. Madisonconcerning <b>a</b> <b>confirmed</b> D.C. {{justice of the peace}} who had not received his commissionas a test case for the constitutionality of the repeal. The next session of the Supreme Court was in June, one month before the repeal would take effect. But, the Judiciary Act of 1802 delayed the Court's next session until February 1803, and made other changes to the structure of the judicial system.|$|E

5|$|Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler ("Life Guards SS Adolf Hitler"; LSSAH) was {{an elite}} SS {{protection}} unit founded in 1933 as a palace guard to provide protection for Hitler's residences and offices. The LSSAH {{had some of}} the strictest entry requirements. The commander, Sepp Dietrich insisted that the men be in good physical condition, between the ages of 23 to 35, and have <b>a</b> <b>confirmed</b> ancestry record without Jewish lineage. The LSSAH eventually grew into an elite division of the Waffen-SS. Although nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration. By 1945, while the LSSAH fought on the Eastern Front during World War II, a core group of 800 men stayed in Berlin and made up the Leibstandarte Guard Battalion (Wache Reichskanzlei), assigned to guard the Führer.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease. Genetic testing {{can be used to}} confirm a physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic testing can confirm if an individual or embryo carries an expanded copy of the trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene that causes the disease. Genetic counseling is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the implications of <b>a</b> <b>confirmed</b> diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.|$|E
5|$|On March 4, 1801, President John Adams's {{last day}} in office, Adams {{nominated}} and the Senate confirmed 20 D.C. justices {{of the peace}} for Washington County and 19 for Alexandria County. On March 16, President Thomas Jefferson issued 15 commissions to justices of the peace in Washington County, including 13 nominated by Adams, and 15 in Alexandria County, including 11 nominated by Adams; the remainder were of his own choosing. (Jefferson's list, submitted to the Senate on January 6, 1802, erroneously contained the name of John Laird, <b>a</b> <b>confirmed</b> Adams appointed who had not received a commission from Jefferson, instead of More.)

5|$|Raised {{to acting}} {{squadron}} leader, Steege was given {{command of the}} newly arrived No.450 Squadron at Rayak, Lebanon, on 31May 1941. The assignment was a challenging one, as the operational requirements of existing forces, and the RAAF Air Board's insistence on staffing ArticleXV squadrons such as No.450 with Australian Empire Air Training Scheme aircrew rather than Permanent Air Force members, meant that the unit was short of experienced pilots. Steege was mentioned in despatches on 24September 1941 for his leadership of the squadron. By December, it was at nominal strength and equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks; it commenced combat operations out of Gambut and ElAdem, Libya, and began registering victories in February 1942. Steege himself scored <b>a</b> <b>confirmed</b> victory over a Messerschmitt Bf109 on 28March. His final tally in the Middle Eastern theatre was eight enemy aircraft destroyed, two probables and five damaged. He returned to Australia a temporary wing commander in December 1942.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of a stationary front and significant moisture from Hurricane Igor resulted in unprecedented rainfall across parts of eastern Newfoundland, leading to widespread flooding. In Bonavista, more than 10in (250mm) was estimated to have fallen between September20 and 21. In St. Lawrence, <b>a</b> <b>confirmed</b> 9.37in (238mm) of rain fell, ranking Igor as the third-wettest tropical cyclone in Canadian history. The widespread nature of heavy rains ranked the storm as a 1-in-100 year event. Similar to the rainfall, winds across eastern Newfoundland were exacerbated by {{the interaction of the}} front and Igor. In Cape Pine, near where the center of Igor tracked, sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and gusts to 107mph (172km/h) battered the area. No records for sustained winds or gusts were broken; however, it was noted as a 1-in-50 year event even with powerful winter storms taken into account. Along the coast, Igor produced a storm tide of 3.5ft (1.1m). Additionally, offshore waves reached immense heights, measured up to 83.6ft (25.5m); one buoy reported a wave of 92ft (28m) but data is subject to further analysis to verify it.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its {{neighbours}} in the halogen column (chlorine and iodine), bromine is {{not known}} to have <b>a</b> <b>confirmed</b> biological role in humans. A single 2014 study suggests {{that it may be}} a necessary catalyst to make collagen IV, making it essential to basement membrane architecture and tissue development, but these findings have not been confirmed and the precise role posited for bromine is not certain. Aside from this, only circumstantial evidence in the form of hypothesised deprivation symptoms exists for a trace role for bromine. Nevertheless, even if bromine is not an essential element, it can be pharmacologically beneficial. For example, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, formed by the eosinophil, and either chloride or bromide ions, eosinophil peroxidase provides a potent mechanism by which eosinophils kill multicellular parasites (such as, for example, the nematode worms involved in filariasis) and some bacteria (such as tuberculosis bacteria). Eosinophil peroxidase is a haloperoxidase that preferentially uses bromide over chloride for this purpose, generating hypobromite (hypobromous acid), although the use of chloride is possible.|$|E
