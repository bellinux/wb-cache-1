50|$|Kenneth Brown {{undertook}} {{a number of}} exploring expeditions between 1852 and 1863. In 1852, he explored the country behind Glengarry with Major Logue. Two years later, {{he was a member}} of Robert Austin's expedition of 1854. On that expedition, he shot and collected the type specimen of the <b>Australian</b> <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> (Pezoporus occidentalis) on break-away ranges north west of Mount Magnet near Mount Farmer. In 1859, he explored the higher reaches of the Murchison River with William Dalgety Moore to look for new land. In June 1862, he again explored up the Murchison, this time with Thomas Burges.|$|E

50|$|The <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> {{remains one}} of the most elusive and mysterious birds in the world of ornithology. Reliable records of the bird have been few and far between, with efforts to locate the species proving fruitless after an {{authenticated}} report from 1912. Ornithologists continued to patrol the outback for traces, even checking the old nests of other birds, such as the zebra finch, for fragments of <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> feathers.|$|R

40|$|The <b>Night</b> <b>Parrot</b> Pezoporus occidentalis, {{known from}} just two {{specimens}} {{and with no}} confirmed sightings for just over 100 years, and having declined from {{being one of the}} most widespread of Australian birds, has surely been amongst the most enigmatic birds of the world and deservedly the 'holy grail' for many birders. Amazingly, a population of this species has recently been re-discovered by John Young and the 'quest' is over, but swift action is now required lest the 'grail' slip from our grasp. Steps must be taken to protect and manage the newly-located population, and to better understand the biology of the species and the reasons for its widespread decline. Much of this decline occurred {{before the end of the}} 19 th century and must therefore have resulted from broad factors associated with earlier landscape changes, such as cat predation and altered fire regimes. Searches for additional <b>Night</b> <b>Parrot</b> populations also seem warranted. Progress toward these goals would benefit from acceptance of the reasonable accumulation of 'unconfirmed' observations of the species and further utilizing the large numbers of 'amateur' birders who would doubtless be keen to be involved. We suggest that the <b>Night</b> <b>Parrot</b> should now be viewed as an 'icon' for conservation, possibly even an 'indicator' for how successful we are in terms of conservation in general. With his discovery of the <b>Night</b> <b>Parrot,</b> John Young has thus made a significant contribution to conservation, opening a new realm of necessities and possibilities. 6 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Earlier ornithologists {{felt that}} the kakapo {{might be related to}} the ground <b>parrots</b> and <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> of Australia due to their similar colouration, but this is contradicted by recent studies; rather, the cryptic colour seems to be {{adaptation}} to terrestrial habits that evolved twice convergently.|$|R
5000|$|Ornithologist John Gould {{described}} the <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> in 1861, from a specimen—the holotype—that was collected 13 km southeast of Mt Farmer, west of Lake Austin in Western Australia. Its specific epithet is Latin occidentalis [...] "western". The species was originally placed {{within its own}} genus (Geopsittacus) by Gould, though consensus soon swung in favour of placing it in Pezoporus; James Murie dissected a specimen, observing {{that it was very}} similar in anatomy and plumage to the ground parrot. Gould had posited a relationship to the kakapo based on similarity of the plumage, however Murie concluded they were markedly different anatomically. Despite its close relationship with the ground parrot, its placement in the genus Pezoporus was uncertain, with some authorities leaving it in its own genus, as data on the <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> was so limited. A 1994 molecular study using the cytochrome b of several parrot species confirmed the close relationship of the taxa and consensus for its placement in Pezoporus. It also revealed that the kakapo was not closely related to Pezoporus. Analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences in a 2011 study showed that the <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> most likely diverged from the ancestor of the eastern and western ground parrots around 3.3 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|The {{approval}} of the A$2 billion Cloud Break mine project through the then-Minister for the Environment, Ian Campbell, was criticised because {{of a number of}} endangered species {{in the area of the}} future mine, among them the <b>night</b> <b>parrot.</b> In order to gain EPA approval, the mine had to implement a management plan to ensure that mining activities would not have a negative effect on the species survival in the area. The occurrence of the <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> in the future mining area, at Minga Well on 12 April 2005, was discovered during a 2005 survey commissioned by FMG, which was carried out by two contract biologists who sighted a small group of the birds. Unconfirmed sightings of the bird had been made previously in a nearby area in 2004.|$|R
50|$|The sighting, at dusk, was by {{biologists}} Dr Robert Davis and Mr Brendan Metcalf, {{who were}} not able to obtain a photograph of the three birds they saw, but are confident that they spotted three <b>night</b> <b>parrots.</b> The detailed descriptions of their sighting were accepted by the Birds Australia Rarities Committee (BARC) making it the first accepted <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> sighting in modern times. Based on this acceptance by scientific peers, a paper describing the sighting was published in the Australian ornithological journal, Emu in 2008. The two biologists carried out further searches at Minga Well and Moojari Well the following five nights after the sighting, but were unable to see the birds again. A follow up survey of the Fortescue Marsh area in May 2005 was unsuccessful in finding any conclusive evidence of the species.|$|R
50|$|The western {{ground parrot}} (Pezoporus flaviventris) is an {{endangered}} species of parrot endemic to Western Australia and is a close relative of the eastern ground parrot (P. wallicus) and the somewhat more distantly related and mysterious <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> (Pezoporus occidentalis).

50|$|The eastern {{ground parrot}} (Pezoporus wallicus) of Australia {{is one of}} only five ground-dwelling parrots in the world, the others being its closest relatives, the western ground parrot (Pezoporus flaviventris), the {{extremely}} rare <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> (Pezoporus occidentalis), the somewhat closely related Antipodes parakeet (Cyanoramphus unicolor), and the unrelated highly endangered kakapo (Strigops habroptila) from New Zealand.|$|R

50|$|A {{relatively}} small and short-tailed parrot, the species' colour is predominantly a yellowish green, mottled with dark brown, blacks and yellows. Both sexes have this coloration. It is {{distinguished from the}} two superficially similar ground parrot species by its shorter tail and different range and habitat. Predominantly terrestrial, taking to the air only when panicked or in search of water, the <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> has furtive, nocturnal habits and—even when it was abundant—was apparently a highly secretive species. Its natural habitat {{appears to be the}} spinifex grass which still dominates much of the dry, dusty Australian interior; other early reports also indicate that it never strayed far from water. It may also inhabit chenopod shrublands, eucalyptus woodlands, and mallee shrublands. One of the vocalisations of the <b>night</b> <b>parrot</b> {{has been described as a}} croak and identified as a contact call.. Other calls, mostly short 'ding-ding' whistles, and a more drawn out whistle, have been recorded from Queensland and Western Australia..|$|R
50|$|Some {{species of}} lories and lorikeets are kept as pets but are quite messy, and often more popular as aviary birds. Hanging parrots and fig parrots are {{normally}} kept as aviary birds {{and not as}} pets. Some species as pygmy <b>parrots</b> and kakapos, <b>night</b> <b>parrots,</b> and {{about half of the}} species of parrotlet, are not considered companion parrots due to difficult dietary requirements or unavailability.|$|R
50|$|All {{common names}} for species {{in this family}} {{are the same as}} the {{traditional}} Māori names. The word kākā derives from the ancient Proto-Polynesian word meaning parrot. Kākāpō is a logical extension of that name, as pō means night, resulting in kākā of the <b>night</b> or <b>night</b> <b>parrot,</b> reflecting the species' nocturnal behaviour. The etymology of kea in Māori is less clear, and might be onomatopoeic of its call kee-aah.|$|R
