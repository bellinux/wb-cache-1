In general, the authors conclude that Mexico introducing a real racial classification and accepting itself as a multicultural country opposed to a monolithic Mestizo country would bring benefits to the Mexican society as a whole.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 3 rd July 2019. This {{editorial}} introduction identifies {{a need for}} more multidimensional and collective theorisations of boundary-crossing <b>academic</b> <b>mobilities</b> in order to conceptualise this phenomenon, compare empirical findings, and identify new research perspectives. My suggestion is that triadic thought – or the thinking in three rather than two conceptual categories – overcomes some of the limitations that binary thought has imposed on social theory. By transforming the three conceptual dyads that frame this special issue on boundary-crossing <b>academic</b> <b>mobilities,</b> namely mobility/migration, students/academics, and local/global, into more differentiated relational triads, I argue that ordering and framing studies on <b>academic</b> and other <b>mobilities</b> through three-by-three matrices grounded in triadic thought helps to advance conceptual debate and unfold a wider research agenda in truly collective ways...|$|R

Expansion of on-line education Full Abstract: Globalization process in XXI century requires more common space in higher education field. Access to equal education rights for everyone is vital for Russian universities. There are at least 3 main directions in global higher education: 1. Internationalisation with continually increasing role of English language as a medium for instruction and research. English is globally-recognized language of communication in academic community. In 2014 the NUST MISIS lunched MA and MSc degree programs, taught in English to be more competitive in global educational market. 2. Dramatically growth of students and <b>academics</b> <b>mobility</b> based on common standards and systems of financial support. The Russian Federation joined Bologna Agreement in 2003. The Russian Government launched the Academic Excellence Program, called “ 5 - 100 Project,” to make top Russian universities more transparent and open for international students from other countries. 3. Expansion of on-line education as a part of long-life learning paradigm. Education opportunities are offered by the higher education institutions in many ways; from classic “face-to-face” to MOOCs and distant learning methods. In the same time, the today’s phenomenon of life-long lasting learning demonstrates that people are racing to be more educated, thus, more competitive in the market...|$|R

50|$|Female mobile {{students}} have some particular barriers {{because of their}} gender role. The female mobile students, especially who are in order in age, are tied to a specific spatial context by private responsibilities. For example, partnering and children will have a great effect on the female's <b>academic</b> <b>mobility.</b> Some findings from qualitative interviews with researchers from Bulgaria and Poland, confirmed the great significance of personal and family relationships for female's <b>academic</b> <b>mobility,</b> either as a barrier or as an incentive.|$|E
40|$|In what follows, {{we explore}} the {{implications}} of a mobilities perspective for the conceptualization, teaching, and study of <b>academic</b> literacies. <b>Mobility</b> has come {{to serve as a}} catalyst for rethinking scholarly work in a variety of fields – most provocatively, the assumed stability as well as uniformity of what is studied and the location and products of acts and actors of study. The concept of academic literacies aligns with a mobilities perspective in its challenge to a still-dominant conception of ‘literacy’ as singular, universal, uniform, and stable. However, in recognition that any attempt to define <b>mobility,</b> <b>academic</b> literacies, or ‘mobility and academic literacies’ may itself be antithetical to the inherent mobility of all concepts, including ‘mobility’ and ‘academic literacies’, our exploration takes the form of an epistolary conversation whose movement – its turns, eddies, currents – may illustrate both the potential directions and navigational challenges of taking a <b>mobilities</b> perspective on <b>academic</b> literacies...|$|R

40|$|By using a {{data set}} of {{academic}} economists from Japanese universities, we estimated {{the effect of}} refereed articles on salary, promotion and labor mobility. Results show no effect of refereed articles on salary and on promotion. However, there is a statistically significant effect of refereed articles on labor mobility, though {{the magnitude of the}} effect is rather small. Publishing one additional refereed article increases the probability that an academic has worked in exactly two universities by 0. 4 %. In addition, publishing one additional refereed article in the US or Europe increases the probability that an academic has worked in exactly two universities by 1 %. Refereed articles published in Japan have no statistically significant impact on the probability of working in more universities. We conclude that publishing refereed articles does not reward Japanese economists by a direct increase in salary and accelerated promotion. Our results are thus consistent with the beliefs within Japanese academia that publications do not affect salary or promotion.

40|$|Based on mixed method, {{this paper}} {{deals with the}} {{different}} ways to conciliate job career and private life for academic people who are strongly confronted to spatial <b>mobility.</b> <b>Academic</b> career and <b>mobility</b> influence stages of conjugal and familial development, so that {{the construction of a}} stable couple is more difficult and fertility is postponed. Nevertheless, some recurrent forms of spatial mobility, such as commuting, may constitute a conjugal arrangement to conciliate job career and family life. In everyday life, these arrangements point to gendered differences on family management. Academic mobile males delegate children care and housework to their non-mobile spouse. On the contrary, academic mobile females take charge, at the same time, of domestic management and job career. This double task leads some of these women to reject mobility that is necessary to an academic career, and so implicitly to stop this career...|$|R

Although Bologna Process is perceived as a move to increase the quality of higher education system in Turkey, there are very serious criticisms from academics, students, and businessmen to the Bologna Process in various European countries. This study claims that the Process did not achieve its goals, more importantly the main instruments of the Process (qualifications, quality assurance agency etc.) brought about hyper-bureaucratization, hierarchization and standardization of European higher education systems...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} intra-sectoral <b>mobility</b> of <b>academics</b> on research productivity and R&D information exchange dynamics in Japan. The analysis shows intra-sectoral mobility impacting positively both research productivity and information exchange dynamics, but that this effect-except for information exchange with peers based abroad-has a threshold. This result {{highlights the importance of}} <b>academic</b> job <b>mobility</b> but also alerts for cases of "overloads of mobility," leading us to argue for some degree of stability in academic careers, supported by policies fostering temporary international mobility spells. We also find that the role of foreign academics in the Japanese higher education is one of national and international gatekeepers being this role shaped by where the doctorate was obtained (Japan vs abroad). Japanese academics that have performed the doctorate abroad are also key international gatekeepers. © 2013 Education Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
