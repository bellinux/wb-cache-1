40|$|Cooperative efforts {{between the}} Lockheed-Huntsville Computational Mechanics Group and the NASA-MSFC Computational Fluid Dynamics staff has {{resulted}} in improved capabilities for numerically simulating incompressible flows generic to the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). A well established and documented CFD code was obtained, modified, and applied to laminar and turbulent flows of the type occurring in the SSME Hot Gas Manifold. The INS 3 D code was installed on the NASA-MSFC CRAY-XMP computer system and is currently being used by NASA engineers. Studies to perform a transient analysis of the FPB were conducted. The COBRA/TRAC code is recommended for simulating the transient flow of oxygen into the LOX manifold. Property data for modifying the code to represent LOX/GOX flow was collected. The <b>ALFA</b> <b>code</b> was developed and recommended for representing the transient combustion in the preburner. These two codes will couple through the transient boundary conditions to simulate the startup and/or shutdown of the fuel preburner. A study, NAS 8 - 37461, is currently being conducted to implement this modeling effort...|$|E
