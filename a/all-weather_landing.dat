However, an airfield at the present location of Kirksville Regional Airport wasn't created until 1930 when the Federal Aviation Administration built a series of emergency landing strips across the nation. With America's entry into World War II, the Kirksville Municipal Airport, as it had been declared in the late 1930s, received a major upgrade from the Civilian Pilots Training Program and the US Army Air Corps War Training Service.

40|$|To fully {{appreciate}} {{the development of the}} specific operational capabilities weather-modification could deliver to the war fighter, we must examine and understand their relationship to associated core competencies and the development of their requisite technologies.

40|$|CNAS 1 (Collaborative Network for Atmospheric Sensing) is an agent-based, {{power-aware}} {{sensor network}} for ground-level atmospheric monitoring. In many multi-agent applications, reducing message transmission {{is a primary}} objective. In CNAS, however, itâs not the cost of sending messages, but when messages can be sent that is the driving communication constraint. CNAS agents must have their radios turned off most of the time, as even listening consumes significant power. Working in such collaborative isolation changes the character of agent interaction, as agents must have their radios turned on when others are sending messages to them. CNAS requires agent policies that can intelligently meet operational requirements while communicating only during intermittent, mutually established, communication windows. In this paper, we describe the CNAS agents and their hardware and blackboard-system software architectures. We also relate experiences and lessons learned from a field deployment of CNAS at the 2006 PATRIOT Exercise held last July at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, and we discuss the upcoming CNAS deployment {{in conjunction with the}} Talisman Saber Combined Exercise to be conducted MayâJuly 2007 in Australia. We conclude with an overview of current CNAS research that is exploring the addition of a rollable solar panel to each sensor agent that allows its battery reserves to grow (up to full capacity) when sunlight is available. Replenishable power reserves can support unlimited operational lifetimes, but activity decisions become more complex as each agent now must consider how much additional power may become available and when. 1.

40|$|A fixed-based {{simulation}} {{experiment was}} conducted in NASA Langley Research Center s Integration Flight Deck simulator to investigate enabling technologies for equivalent visual operations (EVO) in the emerging Next Generation Air Transportation System operating environment. EVO implies the capability to achieve or even improve on the safety of current-day Visual Flight Rules (VFR) operations, maintain the operational tempos of VFR, and perhaps even retain VFR procedures - all independent of the actual weather and visibility conditions. Twenty-four air transport-rated pilots evaluated the use of Synthetic/Enhanced Vision Systems (S/EVS) and eXternal Vision Systems (XVS) technologies as enabling technologies for future all-weather operations. The experimental objectives were to determine the feasibility of XVS/SVS/EVS to provide for all weather (visibility) landing capability without the need (or ability) for a visual approach segment and to determine the interaction of XVS/EVS and peripheral vision cues for terminal area and surface operations. Another key element of the testing investigated the pilot's awareness and reaction to non-normal events (i. e., failure conditions) that were unexpectedly introduced into the experiment. These non-normal runs served as critical determinants in the underlying safety of all-weather operations. Experimental data from this test are cast into performance-based approach and landing standards which might establish a basis for future <b>all-weather</b> <b>landing</b> operations. Glideslope tracking performance appears to have improved with {{the elimination of the}} approach visual segment. This improvement can most likely be attributed {{to the fact that the}} pilots didn't have to simultaneously perform glideslope corrections and find required visual landing references in order to continue a landing. Lateral tracking performance was excellent regardless of the display concept being evaluated or whether or not there were peripheral cues in the side window. Although workload ratings were significantly less when peripheral cues were present compared to when there were none, these differences appear to be operationally inconsequential. Larger display concepts tested in this experiment showed significant situation awareness (SA) improvements and workload reductions compared to smaller display concepts. With a fixed display size, a color display was more influential in SA and workload ratings than a collimated display...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in aviation industry requires parallel effective plans, programs and designs of systems and facilities nationwide to fulfill the increasing needs for safe air transportation. Aircraft landing remains a problem {{for a long time}} all over the world. Systems that aircraft rely on in landing are unreliable to perform a precise guidance due to many limitations such as inaccuracy, unreliability and dependency. In low visibility conditions, when pilots are unable to see the runway, the aircrafts are diverted to another airport. However, low visibility can also affect all airports in the vicinity, forcing aircrafts to land in low visibility conditions depending on Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). Aircraft approach and landing are the most hazardous portions of flight; accidents records indicate that approximately 50 percent of the accidents occur during aircraft landing. Aircraft landing Category III C is not yet in operation anywhere in the world. It requires landing with no visibility or runway visual range. Currently, Global Positioning System (GPS) is the main navigation system used all over the world for aircraft navigation, approach and landing. However, in aircraft approach and landing phase, the accuracy of GPS is not sufficient to perform a perfect landing due to the possibility of aircraft to be drifted out of the runway. The accuracy of GPS could be improved to 3 meter by sending correction. Improved accuracy {{has not been able to}} meet ICAO standards for aircraft automatic landing. In this paper, aircraft landing systems characteristics, performance and accuracies have been studied and compared for the purpose of assessinglimitations and drawbacks.

40|$|Enhanced Vision (EV) and {{synthetic}} vision (SV) systems {{may serve as}} enabling technologies {{to meet the challenges}} of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) Equivalent Visual Operations (EVO) concept ? that is, the ability to achieve or even improve on the safety of Visual Flight Rules (VFR) operations, maintain the operational tempos of VFR, and even, perhaps, retain VFR procedures independent of actual weather and visibility conditions. One significant challenge lies in the definition of required equipage on the aircraft and on the airport to enable the EVO concept objective. A piloted simulation experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of the presence or absence of Synthetic Vision, the location of this information during an instrument approach (i. e., on a Head-Up or Head-Down Primary Flight Display), and the type of airport lighting information on landing minima. The quantitative data from this experiment were analyzed to begin the definition of performance-based criteria for <b>all-weather</b> approach and <b>landing</b> operations. Objective results from the present study showed that better approach performance was attainable with the head-up display (HUD) compared to the head-down display (HDD). A slight performance improvement in HDD performance was shown when SV was added, as the pilots descended below 200 ft to a 100 ft decision altitude, but this performance was not tested for statistical significance (nor was it expected to be statistically significant). The touchdown data showed that regardless of the display concept flown (SV HUD, Baseline HUD, SV HDD, Baseline HDD) a majority of the runs were within the performance-based defined approach and landing criteria in all the visibility levels, approach lighting systems, and decision altitudes tested. For this visual flight maneuver, RVR appeared to be the most significant influence in touchdown performance.
