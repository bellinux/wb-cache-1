2500|$|At Cranley Gardens, Nilsen had {{no access}} to a garden, and as he resided in an attic flat, {{he was unable to}} stow any bodies beneath his floorboards. For almost two months, any acquaintances Nilsen {{encountered}} and lured to his flat were not assaulted in any manner, although he attempted to strangle a 19-year-old student named Paul Nobbs on 23 November 1981. In March 1982, Nilsen encountered a 23-year-old named John Howlett as he (Nilsen) drank in a pub located close to Leicester Square. Howlett was lured to Nilsen's flat on the promise of continuing drinking with Nilsen. At Cranley Gardens, both Nilsen and Howlett drank as they watched a film, before Howlett walked into Nilsen's front room and fell asleep in the bed (which was located in the front room at this time). One hour later, Nilsen unsuccessfully attempted to rouse Howlett, then {{sat on the edge of}} the bed drinking rum <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Howlett, before deciding to kill him. Following a ferocious struggle (in which Howlett himself attempted to strangle his attacker), Nilsen strangled Howlett into unconsciousness with an upholstery strap before returning to his living room, shaking from the [...] "stress of the struggle" [...] in which he had believed he would be overpowered. On three occasions over the following ten minutes, Nilsen unsuccessfully attempted to kill this victim after noting he had resumed breathing, before deciding to fill his bathtub with water and drown him.|$|E

60|$|Edward {{was still}} inarticulate. His face twitched, his eyes watered <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|E
50|$|Nandalal is {{overwhelmed}} by emotions <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> {{the money in}} his hand. Putting the money back in pocket, he walks away.|$|R
50|$|Júlio Madiaga is a probinciano, a young rustic {{from the}} island of Marinduque, who arrives in Manila. From time to time, Júlio would pass by the corner of Ongpin and Misericordia, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> a {{peculiar}} building from a distance. While pursuing his quest, he has to work {{in order to survive}} the conditions of the urban jungle.|$|R
60|$|The boy {{produced}} a sealed packet, which Captain Cuttle <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the keys.|$|R
60|$|Harper {{stood up}} and {{straightened}} himself, clenching {{his hands on the}} chair back <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Appleby.|$|E
60|$|Grandfather Frog {{shook his}} head. His big goggly eyes seemed more goggly than ever, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the new pond in the Green Forest.|$|E
6000|$|The {{contract}} {{had been}} laid face upwards upon the table. Frank Crosse's face grew whiter and his eyes larger <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> it. It ran in this way - ...|$|E
60|$|The captain {{leaned back}} in his arm-chair, and turned his {{toothpick}} between his lips, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> hard <b>at</b> the girl.|$|R
40|$|Department of Public Works workers, [s. d. ]. At center, two {{men can be}} {{standing}} beside three large blueprints attached to the wall. The shorter man at left wears a suit and tie. He holds a pen {{in his left hand}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> a small piece of paper in his right hand. The taller man at right also wears a suit and tie, as well <b>as</b> glasses. <b>He</b> holds a larger paper in his left hand, while his right hand points with a pen to the large blueprint on the wall...|$|R
6000|$|Peter was puzzled. <b>He</b> {{showed it}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> down <b>at</b> Mrs. Teeter {{just in front}} of him. [...] "I don't see any nest or eggs or anything," [...] said he rather testily.|$|R
6000|$|... "There an't," [...] growled {{the man on}} the floor, {{whose head}} rested on his hand <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> us, [...] "any more on you to come in, is there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How long?" [...] said he, {{taking his}} black pipe from his mouth, and {{dropping}} his jaw <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me. [...] "I'm not a going back. I've come for good." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the warm}} visage of Bumpus elongated, {{and his eyes}} opened uncommonly wide <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> a {{particular}} spot in the ground; insomuch that Corrie burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pegging away at her Greek, I suppose. She {{usually is}} in the evening. More's the pity,' added Demi, in a low tone, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> intently <b>at</b> the book-case, though he couldn't read a title.|$|R
5000|$|Clyde, welcomed back by {{his friends}} and family, tries to search for Ellie. He asks many people only to find {{they do not know}} where or who she is. Clyde {{suggests}} they use Mr Smith to track her, but Rani points out her name on a sign, indicating that Ellie took the name. A man there saw Ellie board a truck named [...] "Night Dragon Haulage". He explains that the truck driver occasionally would drive some people to other places for a better life. At night in his room, Clyde reminisces about Ellie <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> his portrait of her.|$|R
6000|$|The boy grew {{pale and}} then red. His eyes narrowed <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> fixedly <b>at</b> the officer. But {{he did not}} change his position, nor did he betray either fear or agitation. In a voice quite unmoved he asked: ...|$|R
60|$|And <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> it, {{it began}} slowly to dawn upon Fenn {{that he had}} not shown up to {{advantage}} in the recent interview. In a word, he had made a fool of himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was the Holy Crocodile," [...] said Rames abstractedly <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> {{the boiling}} waters, [...] "which has lived {{here during the}} reigns of eight Pharaohs, and perhaps longer. Now we have seen it." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} Eldon Parr, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the clergyman, {{tightened}} his lips,--lips that seemed peculiarly formed for compression. Then they relaxed into what resembled a smile. If it were one, the other returned it.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Montrose gave a gasp of dismay, while Maud flushed painfully. The captain, however, {{allowed a}} gleam of admiration to soften his grim {{features}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> fixedly <b>at</b> saucy Flo. Patsy marked this fleeting change of expression {{at once and}} said hastily: ...|$|R
50|$|The year 1969. Kinshasa, Congo. On July 21, the Apollo 11 {{is going}} {{to land on the}} Moon. Tanga and Nika, husband and wife, wait for Sister Mwezi to spend a “Moon” evening with Nika’s brother Muntu-wa-Bantu. However, the nun does not appear. The Moon is full. Muntu-wa-Bantu holds the {{transistor}} radio up to his ear <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the Moon. <b>He</b> wants to see the first steps of mankind on the Moon for himself. But no matter how long <b>he</b> <b>stares,</b> <b>he</b> cannot see what they are saying on the radio. Can the Moon be that far away? That night, Muntu-wa-Bantu decides that he too will walk on the Moon.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! if I {{could only}} {{fly to the}} highest beam in the barn, and give a splendid crow that {{everyone}} could hear, I should be perfectly happy,' said this silly little fowl, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> up <b>at</b> the loft where the old cock often sat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Her honor?" [...] Sir John's ruddy {{face had}} turned redder still, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the troubled {{features}} of the priest. [...] "Her honor, say you--the honor of my daughter? Make good those words, or never set your foot over the threshold of Cosford again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Was I drunk?" [...] he repeated. [...] "I ask you, because I {{was never}} touched by drink {{in my life}} before, and I don't know." [...] He stood with his huge hands {{trembling}} {{on the back of}} his chair, and his dry lips apart, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Corey.|$|E
60|$|They {{said nothing}} to Pessim, who was sitting on his stool and scowling dismally <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the ocean, but started at once to seek the trees that bore the magic fruits. The Ork remembered very well where the {{lavender}} berries grew and led his companions quickly to the spot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello, Flitter!" [...] exclaimed Peter, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> up <b>at</b> {{a little}} dark form darting this way, {{twisting}} that way, now up, now down, almost brushing Peter's {{head and then}} flying so high he could hardly be seen. [...] "Why should I stay at home?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{subsequent}} title card reads [...] "Sixteen years ago." [...] We see {{the second}} young man's {{face for the}} first time (and discover that he is also played by Pierre Batcheff) <b>as</b> <b>he</b> admires the art supplies and books on the table near the wall and forces the first young man to hold two of the books <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the wall. The first young man eventually shoots the second young man when the books abruptly turn into pistols. The second young man, now in a meadow, dies while swiping at the back of a nude female figure which suddenly disappears into thin air. A group of men come and carry his corpse away.|$|R
50|$|Brushing {{his hand}} across his face, Kagenobu sates his curiosity if the fury that drove Eliza {{to the school and}} once lingered deep within her was no longer there. Offended by him {{questioning}} her, Eliza slaps his hand away while informing him the fury still remains. While Eliza demands to know what would become of her father since he is a foreigner himself, Kagenobu tells her he is protected since he is of value to The Hand since they have been using him as an unwitting spy for all the years they’ve known the two. Enraged by Kagenobu’s betrayal, Eliza slaps him and turns her back on him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> her coldly while rubbing his jaw struck by her blow.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Boltwood {{reached in}} his change pocket. He had no quarter. He {{pulled out a}} plump bill-fold. Without looking at the man, Claire could vision his eyes glistening and his chops {{dripping}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the hoard. Mr. Boltwood handed him a dollar bill. [...] "There, take that, and let's change the subject," [...] said Mr. Boltwood testily.|$|E
60|$|Little old shrivelled Ah Moy debated. He visibly thought, {{although}} none knew the intrinsicness of his thinking <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the gun {{of the fat}} pawnbroker and at the leprosy of Kwaque and Daughtry, and weighed the one against the other and tossed the light and heavy loads of the two boats into the balance.|$|E
6000|$|He {{seemed to}} brace {{himself up and}} lean {{backward}} against the air <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me. “How about this here tide that’s rushin’ out through the Golden Gate?” he demanded, or bellowed, rather. “How fast is she ebbin’? What’s the drift, eh? Listen to that, will you? A bell-buoy, and we’re a-top of it! See ’em alterin’ the course!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Vincent Cawdor," [...] she continued, [...] "came in alone. <b>He</b> {{looked just}} <b>as</b> {{objectionable}} <b>as</b> ever, and <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me till I nearly threw my wine glass at him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [But <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{continues}} to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> her a strange disorder appears in his face. MAGGIE feels {{that it is}} to be now or never.] ...|$|R
50|$|Much later, Kreutz finally {{gives in}} to temptation and reveals the Crystal to Johann Tring. Tring is giddy with {{excitement}} and instructs Kreutz {{to gaze at}} the crystal. The alchemist, however, is tired from his numerous trances and goes into one <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> the gemstone. In it his thoughts arrange themselves into a strange order, and he reads in the stone what Tring believes to be the formula for the chrysopoeia, but what is in actuality the formula for a niter-based explosive. When Tring mixes the ingredients together, the loft explodes into flames and Tring flees for cover. Kreutz grabs the stone and, still crazed, heads off into the streets of Kraków. After that, he is dragged to the tower by Jan Kanty and the Great Tarnov Crystal is given back to Pan Andrew.|$|R
