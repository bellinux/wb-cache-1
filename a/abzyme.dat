40|$|AbstractVarious catalytically active {{antibodies}} or <b>abzymes</b> {{have been}} detected recently in the sera of patients with several autoimmune pathologies, where their presence is most probably associated with autoimmunization.

50|$|In a June 2008 {{issue of}} the journal Autoimmunity Review, {{researchers}} S Planque, Sudhir Paul, Ph.D, and Yasuhiro Nishiyama, Ph.D of the University Of Texas Medical School at Houston announced that they have engineered an <b>abzyme</b> that degrades the superantigenic region of the gp120 CD4 binding site. This is the one part of the HIV virus outer coating that does not change, because it is the attachment point to T lymphocytes, the key cell in cell-mediated immunity. Once infected by HIV, patients produce antibodies to the more changeable parts of the viral coat. The antibodies are ineffective because of the virus' ability to change their coats rapidly. Because this protein gp120 is necessary for HIV to attach, it does not change across different strains and is a point of vulnerability across the entire range of the HIV variant population.|$|E

The dependence of the <b>abzyme</b> hydrolytic activity on the molar ratio of water to surfactant (w(o)) showed a bell-shaped curve, presenting a maximum at w(o) = 11. 1. An increase of the AOT concentration at constant w(o), resulted in a decrease of the catalytic activity suggesting a possible inhibition effect of the surfactant. The incorporation of the <b>abzyme</b> into the reverse micelle system caused a blue shift of the fluorescence emission maximum by a magnitude of 7 - 10 nm depending on the w(o) value. This result indicates that the antibody molecule, or {{a large part of}} it, is located in the aqueous microphase of the system.

Here we have shown {{for the first time}} that anti-MBP SLE IgGs hydrolyze nonspecific tri- and tetrapeptides with an extreme low efficiency and cannot effectively hydrolyze longer 20 -mer nonspecific oligopeptides corresponding to antigenic determinants (AGDs) of HIV- 1 integrase. At the same time, anti-MBP SLE IgGs efficiently hydrolyze oligopeptides corresponding to AGDs of MBP. All sites of IgG-mediated proteolysis of 21 -and 25 -mer encephalytogenic oligopeptides corresponding to two known AGDs of MBP were found by a combination of reverse-phase chromatography, TLC, and MALDI spectrometry. Several clustered major, moderate, and minor sites of cleavage were revealed in the case of 21 - and 25 -mer oligopeptides. The active sites of anti-MBP <b>abzymes</b> are localised on their light chains, while heavy chains are responsible for the affinity of protein substrates.

It was interesting whether Abs from patients with viral diseases can hydrolyze viral proteins. Electrophoretically and immunologically homogeneous IgGs were isolated from sera of AIDS patients by chromatography on several affinity sorbents. We present evidence showing that 89. 5 % IgGs purified from the sera of HIV-infected patients using several affinity resins including Sepharose with immobilized integrase specifically hydrolyze only HIV integrase (IN) {{but not many}} other tested proteins.

Similar to autoimmune proteolytic <b>abzymes,</b> IN-hydrolyzing IgGs from some patients were inhibited by specific inhibitors of serine and metal-dependent proteases but a significant inhibition of the activity by specific inhibitors of acidic- and thiol-like proteases was observed for the first time. Although HIV infection leads to formation of Abs to many viral and human antigens, no possible biological role for most of them is known. Since anti-IN IgG can efficiently hydrolyze IN, a positive role of <b>abzymes</b> in counteracting the infection cannot be excluded.

Determination of DNAse activity of immunoglobulins with different DNA substrates, and search for specific substrates for distinct clinical entities could serve these purposes. The aim of present work is to determine DNase activity of the polyclonal class G immunoglobulins in rheumatoid and reactive arthritis using various methods. Different methods are used to evaluate nuclease activity. In this paper we present newly developed and modified techniques for determination of DNAse activity of polyclonal IgGs. Particular attention was paid to the electrophoretic method of DNase activity assessment. Polyclonal IgG isolated from blood serum of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and reactive arthritis were used for assays. In this study, we demonstrated the presence of an inhomogeneous DNase activity of immunoglobulins in relation to different substrates. Along with calf thymus DNA, we used bacterial plasmid DNA and PCR products based on bacterial gene sequences. Levels of DNase activity by rivanol clot method with calf thymus DNA as substrate proved to be higher in patients with rheumatoid arthritis than the control values (p < 0. 01).

Cleavage of peptide substrates by 6 B 8 -E 12 revealed distinct patterns of hydrolysis with high preference for aromatic residues {{before or after the}} scissile bond. Catalytic activity of Ab 2 was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a mechanism-based inhibitor of serine hydrolases. 5 -H 4 and 6 B 8 -E 12 were cloned, produced in Escherichia coli as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), and purified. Kinetic parameters for amidolytic and esterolytic activities were similar in Ab 2 and its scFv derivative. Although the antigen-specific portion of 6 B 8 -E 12 possesses no primary structure similarity to subtilisin, it mimics proteolytic and amidolytic functions of the parental antigen, albeit with 4 orders of magnitude slower acceleration rates.

We propose that complementary proteins, which occur naturally or result from cellular dysfunction, might be more common than recognized currently. This implies that the role of complementary proteins in autoimmunity merits increasing investigation. The concept of complementary proteins is reviewed here and, also, new ideas are presented that underscore the role of open-reading frames in frame - 1 of recognized genes in the production of complementary proteins (frame - 1 is the reverse complement sequence of a gene that uses the antisense of the codons of frame + 1). Furthermore, a novel role for palindromic sequences in autoimmunity and a new model explaining how <b>abzymes</b> and autoantigen complementarity might be related are proposed...|$|R
40|$|We report here our {{preliminary}} {{results on the}} use of catalytic antibodies as an approach to neutralizing organophosphorus chemical weapons. A first-generation hapten, methyl-α-hydroxyphosphinate Ha, was designed to mimic the approach of an incoming water molecule for the hydrolysis of exceedingly toxic methylphosphonothioate VX (1 a). A moderate protective activity was first observed on polyclonal antibodies raised against Ha. The results were further confirmed by using a mAb PAR 15 raised against phenyl-α-hydroxyphosphinate Hb, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of PhX (1 b), a less toxic phenylphosphonothioate analog of VX with a rate constant of 0. 36 M− 1 ⋅min− 1 at pH 7. 4 and 25 °C, which corresponds to a catalytic proficiency of 14, 400 M− 1 toward the rate constant for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of 1 b. This is a demonstration on the organophosphorus poisons themselves that mAbs can catalytically hydrolyze nerve agents, and a significant step toward the production of therapeutically active <b>abzymes</b> to treat poisoning by warfare agents...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHIV- 1 {{integrase}} (IN) catalyzes {{integration of}} a DNA {{copy of the}} viral genome into the host genome. In contrast to canonical proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K), IgGs and IgMs isolated from HIV-infected patients by affinity chromatography on immobilized IN specifically hydrolyzed only IN but not many other tested intact globular proteins. The sites of IN cleavage determined by MALDI mass spectrometry were localized mainly within seven known immunodominant regions of IN. Thin layer chromatography analysis {{has shown that the}} <b>abzymes</b> (Abzs) could also cleave 17 to 22 -mer oligopeptides (OPs) corresponding to the immunodominant regions of IN sequence with a much higher rate than non-specific long peptides or three- and tetrapeptides of various sequence. Therefore, a prolonged incubation of IN with AIDS IgGs and IgMs having high catalytic activity usually produces many OPs of different length. Since anti-IN IgGs and IgMs can efficiently hydrolyze IN, a positive role of the Abzs in counteracting the infection is possible...|$|R
