The Avignon Papacy ended in 1376 when the pope returned to Rome, but was followed in 1378 by the 38-year-long Western schism with claimants to the papacy in Rome, Avignon and (after 1409) Pisa.

5|$|The {{surge of}} German nationalism, {{stimulated by the}} {{experience}} of Germans in the Napoleonic period and initially allied with liberalism, shifted political, social, and cultural relationships within the German states. In this context, one can detect {{its roots in the}} experience of Germans in the Napoleonic period. The Burschenschaft student organizations and popular demonstrations, such as those held at Wartburg Castle in October 1817, contributed to <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>sense</b> of unity among German speakers of Central Europe. Furthermore, implicit and sometimes explicit promises made during the War of Liberation engendered an expectation of popular sovereignty and widespread participation in the political process, promises that largely went unfulfilled once peace had been achieved. Agitation by student organizations led such conservative leaders as Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich, to fear the rise of national sentiment; the assassination of German dramatist August von Kotzebue in March 1819 by a radical student seeking unification was followed on 20 September 1819 by the proclamation of the Carlsbad Decrees, which hampered intellectual leadership of the nationalist movement.|$|E

This is more an anthropological approach than historical that sees the slow universalization of the idea of compassion for the Other as a process that begins with the ideal of “to civilize the war”, but whose affirmation will entail the overcoming the initial arguments of religious nature and the adoption of a wider idea of the Other as similar in more absolute terms.

What the generational cycle can do, according to Strauss and Howe, is explain how society is likely to respond to these events in different eras.

[...] While many composers continued to write symphonies during the 1820s and 30s, [...] "there was <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>sense</b> that these works were aesthetically far inferior to Beethoven's....

He took up the suggestion of former college friend Arthur Grimble, by then a colonial administrator in the Ellice Islands, that he visit the South Pacific, a fashionable destination for 1920s Europeans. To Keable the South Seas appeared to offer escape from the hypocrisies of British society, as well as furnishing a climate better suited to his never-hearty constitution. In 1922 Keable and Buck sailed aboard the Bendigo for the South Pacific via Australia, where Keable undertook a book tour, giving lectures in which he broadcast his new sexual ethics: that unmarried couples in love could have deeply moral relationships, while loveless spouses who stayed together for convention's sake were committing acts of deep immorality.

30|$|Perhaps {{the first}} unified {{definition}} of CSR {{was presented in}} 1979 by Carroll (1979), who placed specific responsibilities and expectations (economic, legal, ethical and discretionary) upon corporations and who understood {{the economic and social}} objectives of firms {{as an integral part of}} a business framework and not as incompatible aspects. This gave way to the debate around the operationalization of CSR during the 1980 ’s and into the early 1990 ’s which brought forward a new understanding of the concept as a decision making process (see: Jones 1980) and was accompanied by the proposal of models and frameworks for its implementation (see: Cochran and Wood 1984; Strand 1983; Tuzzolino and Armandi 1981). In 1991, Carroll (1991) presented the “Pyramid of Corporate Social Responsibility” to represent what he defined as the four main responsibilities of any company and explicitly placing specific responsibilities on corporations. It was also during this period when the adoption of international agreements on sustainable development reflected, to a certain extent, <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of awareness with respect to the impact of corporate behavior (e.g. the creation of the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1983, the UN adoption of the Montreal Protocol in 1987, the creation of the IPCC in 1988, the creation of the European Environmental Agency in 1990 and the UN summit on the Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro which translated into the adoption of the Agenda 21 and the UNFCCC in 1992).

Reform of the academic orders, new curricula and radical changes to the teaching staff ushered in a new season of intense teaching and scientific work at the University.
