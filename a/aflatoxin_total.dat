5000|$|<b>Aflatoxin</b> <b>total</b> {{synthesis}} {{concerns the}} total synthesis {{of a group}} of organic compounds called aflatoxins. These compounds occur naturally in several fungi. As with other chemical compound targets in organic chemistry, the organic synthesis of aflatoxins serves various purposes. Traditionally it served to prove the structure of a complex biocompound in addition to evidence obtained from spectroscopy. It also demonstrates new concepts in organic chemistry (reagents, reaction types) and opens the way to molecular derivatives not found in nature. And for practical purposes, a synthetic biocompound is a commercial alternative to isolating the compound from natural resources. Aflatoxins in particular add another dimension because it is suspected that they have been mass-produced in the past from biological sources as part of a biological weapons program.|$|E
40|$|This study aims at {{evaluating}} {{the effects of}} Zataria multiflora (Z. multiflora) essential oil (EO) on growth, aflatoxin production and transcription of aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway genes. Total RNAs of Aspergillus parasiticus (A. parasiticus) ATCC 56775 grown in yeast extract sucrose (YES) broth medium treated with Z. multiflora EO were subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Specific primers of nor- 1, ver- 1, omt-A and aflR genes were used. In parallel mycelial dry weight of samples were measured and all the media were assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for aflatoxinB 1 (AFB 1), aflatoxinB 2 (AFB 2), aflatoxinG 1 (AFG 1), aflatoxinG 2 (AFG 2) and <b>aflatoxin</b> <b>total</b> (AFTotal) production. The results showed that mycelial dry weight and aflatoxin production reduce {{in the presence of}} Z. multiflora EO (100 ppm) on day 5 of growth. It was found that the expression of nor- 1, ver- 1, omt-A and aflR genes was correlated with the ability of fungus to produce aflatoxins on day 5 in YES medium. RT-PCR showed that in the presence of Z. multiflora EO (100 ppm) nor- 1, ver- 1 and omtA genes expression was reduced. It seems that toxin production inhibitory effects of Z. multiflora EO on day 5 may be at the transcription level and this herb may cause reduction in aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway genes activity...|$|E

40|$|Aflatoxins {{are very}} potent mycotoxins produce by molds. Molds are very common pre-harvest and post harvest {{contaminant}} of cereals/cereal products. Despite improved handling, processing and storage of cereals, aflatoxins still remain {{a major problem}} in the cereal processing industry causing both health hazards and economic losses. Therefore, some researchers have suggested that {{in order to avoid the}} toxicity, the levels of aflatoxins and similar toxic compounds in foodstuffs have to be monitored closely, and be kept under control continuously. Otherwise, related health effects like acute and chronic intoxications, and even deaths, will still be an issue. Therefore, in this research the microbial and <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxins</b> analysis of selected cereal flours processed and sold in Abakaliki metropolis was carried out. A total of four cereal samples (maize, millet, sorghum and wheat) were studied. The <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxins</b> were analyzed using highly sensitive competitive Enzyme Link Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) reader. The cereal samples were also analyzed for total fungal count using digital colony counting machine (CCM China). The result showed that all the cereal flours (wheat, sorghum, millet and maize) analyzed were heavily contaminated with fungal cells. The flours also contain unacceptable levels of <b>aflatoxins.</b> The <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxins</b> were above the minimum acceptable limits (10 ppm) according to National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC). The millet and sorghum have the highest fungal and <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxins</b> concentrations while the wheat flour has the lowest fungal and <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxins</b> concentrations. There were significant difference (p< 0. 05) among the <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxins</b> level of the different cereal flours. The research also revealed that flours have high moisture content.

Maize samples obtained from farmers in the village in the mid altitude, dry zone had significantly higher mean aflatoxin (3. 32 µg/kg) and significantly lower mean fumonisin (3. 17 mg/kg) than maize from the other two villages (in the high and mid altitude, high rainfall zones). Most farmers (n= 442) were male (72 %), educated to primary school level (77 %) and aware of mycotoxins (62 %). As well as participating in a development program, Africa Research in Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation, most (86 %) farmers had experience of working with other development programs. All farmers used flat planting, most used improved seeds (98 %), ox ploughing (78 %), insecticides (78 %) and early planting (36 %). Practices associated with mycotoxins were planting time, tillage methods, previous season planted crops, and use of insecticides. Awareness of mycotoxins and climatic conditions were also associated with mycotoxin prevalence. In conclusion, good practices are associated with acceptable aflatoxin levels and should be continued.

Aflatoxin B 1 and B 2 were identified and quantitated in all collected fractions at levels ranging from 1. 7 to 22, 451. 5 µg/kg of AFB 1 + AFB 2, whereas AFG 1 and AFG 2 were not detected. Excellent results were obtained by manual sorting of peeled kernels since the removal of discolored kernels (2. 6 %– 19. 9 % of total peeled kernels) removed 97. 3 %– 99. 5 % of <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxins.</b> The combination of peeling and visual/manual separation of discolored kernels is a feasible strategy to remove 97 %– 99 % of aflatoxins accumulated in naturally-contaminated samples. Electronic optical sorter gave highly variable results since the amount of AFB 1 + AFB 2 measured in rejected fractions (15 %– 18 % of total kernels) ranged from 13 % to 59 % of <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxins.</b> An improved immunoaffinity-based HPLC-FLD method having low limits of detection for the four aflatoxins (0. 01 – 0. 05 µg/kg) was developed and used to monitor the occurrence of aflatoxins in 47 commercial products containing apricot kernels and/or almonds commercialized in Italy. Low aflatoxin levels were found in 38 % of the tested samples and ranged from 0. 06 to 1. 50 μg/kg for AFB 1 and from 0. 06 to 1. 79 μg/kg for <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxins...</b>|$|R

Thestudy aimed at determining the incidence of fungal species e emphasis on Aspergillus section Flavi eassociated with peanut products. A 0. 5 kg representative sample was obtained from each surveyedvendor and the colony forming units (CFU) of fungal species determined. The samples were also analyzedfor <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxin</b> level while isolates of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus were screened forproduction of aflatoxin B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2. Eight fungal species were detected in the samples and were indecreasing order of CFU/g of sample: A. flavus S-strain (467), A. flavus L-strain (341), Penicillium spp. (326), Aspergillus niger (156), Aspergillus tamari (27), Aspergillus alliaceus (21), A. parasiticus (10), andAspergillus caelatus (5). The overall incidence of A. flavus S-strain in samples from Nairobi was 92 and 1425 % higher than samples from Nyanza and Western regions, respectively. The combined incidence ofA. flavus and A. parasiticus was varied significantly (p _ 0. 05) with peanut product: peanut flour (69 %),shelled raw peanuts (53 %), spoilt peanuts (49 %), boiled podded peanuts (45 %), podded peanuts (39 %),peanut butter (31 %), fried peanuts (22 %) and roasted peanuts (20 %). Seventy three percent of A. flavusand A. parasiticus isolates produced {{at least one of}} the aflatoxin types, with 66 % producing aflatoxin B 1. The <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxin</b> level among peanut products ranged from 0 to 1629 mg/g; and there was a positivecorrelation (r ¼ 0. 2711) between the incidence of A. flavus and A. parasiticus, and <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxin</b> level.

This study, an experimental exposure of broiler chicken to feed naturally contaminated with mycotoxins, {{is part of the}} efforts to unravel this problem of low productivity. Broiler chickens aged 1 day to 8 weeks were fed with diet compounded with naturally contaminated raw materials. Another set of day old broiler chicks were fed with feed compounded with high quality materials and served as control. <b>Total</b> <b>aflatoxin</b> and ochratoxin in each diet were determined by ELISA technique. The effects of mycotoxins on the birds were determined for growth performances, immunological status, as well as general well being of the birds. The <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxin</b> and ochratoxin concentrations in test feed were 200 ppb and 10 ppb respectively, while the control feed contained 15 ppb aflatoxin with no detectable level of ochratoxin. Birds fed with mycotoxin-rich diet had significantly lower growth performances (p = 0. 012) and survival rate than control birds. Birds fed on mycotoxin rich diet had lower Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD) antibody titres (42801470) than controls (67801250), an indication of deleterious effect on body immune responses.

40|$|Abstract. The {{mycotoxin}} {{contamination of}} some products which constitutes vegetal substrates in different foodstuff or fodder was often ignored, {{despite the fact}} that the consumption of such products may seriously jeopardize the health. Different food stuffs and fodders samples were collected from a county in the South of Romania and it was studied the concentration of ochratoxin A, zearalenone, fumonisin, deoxynivalenol (DON) and <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxin.</b> Mycotoxins identification was made by using ELISA method and the results interpretation was done according to the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) no. 1881 / 2006. Following the investigations there were recorded values of 1, 28 - 5, 40 times higher than the admitted limits for DON concentration in 7 out of 194 analyzed samples and of 1, 40 - 5, 00 times higher for ochratoxin A in 2 out of 93 analyzed samples. For zearalenone, <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxin</b> and fumonisin, the concentrations ranged within the admitted limits in all samples. During this study, mycotoxin contamination was noticed for a large number of samples. Even if the levels of contamination recorded values lower than the admitted limit, they provide a clear picture regarding the quality of raw materials used for various food and fodder and their processing, transport, storage and marketing conditions...|$|R

During the drying processes, the crop {{is exposed to}} contamination by microorganisms, especially fungi. In this article, the isolation of mycobiota from retail markets and food restaurants of Taif city was studied. Crushed chili showed a high fungal load compared to chili sauce and chili powder, while chili powder showed a high occurrence of <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxins</b> (AFs). Aspergillus, Eurotium and Penicillium were the most common genera isolated from chili samples. Thirty-four samples (out of 60) were naturally contaminated with AFs ranging from 20 to 200 ppb. The <b>total</b> <b>aflatoxin</b> potential of 35 isolates of A. flavus, A. parasiticus and A. tamarri were studied. Seventy percent of A. flavus isolates were aflatoxigenic. The frequencies of aflatoxin biosynthesis genes aflR, nor- 1, ver- 1 and omtA were studied in aflatoxigenic and non-aflatoxigenic isolates of Aspergillus species collected in this study. All aflatoxigenic isolates (21) and 1 non-aflatoxigenic isolate of A. flavus showed DNA fragments that correspond to the complete set of the targeted genes. In conclusion, the high co-occurrence of Aspergillus species capable of producing aflatoxins, particularly in chili samples, suggests {{the need for more}} efficient control during processing and storage to reduce fungal contamination...|$|R
