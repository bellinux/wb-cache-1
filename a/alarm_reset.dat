The player must avoid detection by security systems and enemies, otherwise an alarm will sound and the player will either have to destroy the alarm, avoid or defeat foes alerted by the alarm or hide for several seconds until the <b>alarm</b> <b>resets.</b> The game uses a dynamic music system that changes depending on the state of alarm in the area: the music will increase in volume and pacing when Sly attacks or is detected, and then will quiet down as the disturbance goes away.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{properly}} configured firewall is a {{good starting}} point in securing a computer network. However, complex network environments that involve higher number of participants and endpoints require better security infrastructure. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), proposed as a solution to perimeter defense, have many open problems and it is clear that better solutions must be found. Due to many unsolved problems associated with IDS, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) is introduced. The main idea in IPS is to be proactive. Network intrusion prevention system (NIPS) becomes more complex due to the rapid growth of network bandwidth and requirement of network security.

In this paper, intrusion prevention can be used to and block malicious activity upon detection. To be specific intrusion prevention may involve dropping packets that can be considered malicious, blocking any traffic from an IP address that may be offending, sending <b>alarms,</b> <b>resetting</b> of connections, correcting cyclic redundancy errors etc. Networks refer to an interconnection of computers. Intrusion prevention, therefore, refers to the act of blocking, stopping or reporting activities or accesses that are unauthorized or malicious to a network. Intrusion prevention involves monitoring activities of all the network systems running and the network traffic. This means that intrusio...|$|R
50|$|This in turn {{caused the}} CDUs to issue {{interrupts}} to the guidance computerâ€”12,800 interrupts per second, which consumed about 15% of the computer's available compute time. As {{the rest of}} the landing tasks were consuming about 85% of the computer's time, the computer ran out of time to process all of its queued jobs in a single cycle. As scheduled jobs in the computer failed to complete in time, the programs competed for core set memory and vector accumulator registers; eventually, one and then the other were exhausted, and the LM's guidance computer began sounding program <b>alarms</b> and <b>resetting.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "Fire" [...] or [...] "General Alarm". This {{indicator}} is lit when an alarm condition {{exists in the}} system, initiated by smoke detectors, heat detectors, sprinkler flow switches, manual pull stations, manual call points, or otherwise. Along with the indicator on the panel, notification appliances, such as horns and strobes, are also activated, signaling a need to evacuate to building occupants. In an alarm condition, the fire alarm panel indicates where the alarm originated. The alarm panel can be reset once the device which initiated the <b>alarm</b> is <b>reset,</b> such as returning the handle of a manual pull station to its normal position.|$|R

50|$|<b>Resetting</b> a fire <b>alarm</b> {{pull station}} {{after it has}} been {{operated}} normally requires building personnel or emergency responders to open the station using a key, which often is either a hex key or a more traditional key. Opening the station causes the handle to go back to its original position, allowing the <b>alarm</b> to be <b>reset</b> from the fire alarm control panel after the station has been closed.|$|R
5000|$|On 18June 1986, the Havor Ring {{was stolen}} during visiting hours from the Gotland Museum. The {{circumstances}} of the theft {{have been described as}} [...] "mysterious". On that day, the alarm in the Treasury was activated twice. After the first time, at 12pm, the antiquarian in charge of security found everything in order and the <b>alarm</b> was <b>reset.</b> At 12:45pm the alarm went off again. This time the antiquarian noticed that a latch on the lock was recessed, meaning that the showcase was unlocked, but she did not notice that the torc was gone. She locked the case and <b>reset</b> the <b>alarm</b> again. The theft was discovered at noon the next day. According to the police, the lock had been picked or opened with a key.|$|R
40|$|Alarm system {{operators}} often manage multiple {{alarm systems}} concurrently. Because such situations often accompany cascading events, {{it is important}} to know how operators sequence responses. We examined how the relative reliability and priority of two concurrent alarms affected <b>alarm</b> gauge <b>reset</b> patterns. We hypothesized that operators would respond first to an alarm with higher reliability or higher priority when the other variable was held constant. We also expected participants to respond to alarms with higher priority first when they occurred at the same time as a high-reliability alarm. Sixty-one Old Dominion University undergraduates performed a tracking task and responded to gauge fluctuations (alarms). A between subjects ANOVA revealed that participants responded to alarms with higher priority first when reliability was constant, and to higher reliability alarms first when priority was constant. Our results suggest that relative priority and reliability may be useful parameters to control in complex task situations. Operators of automated alarm systems rely on reliability and priority information to mak...|$|R
50|$|Phase one mode is {{activated}} by a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building. Once an alarm has been activated, the elevator will automatically go into phase one. The elevator will wait {{an amount of}} time, then proceed to go into nudging mode to tell everyone the elevator is leaving the floor. Once the elevator has left the floor, depending on where the alarm was set off, the elevator {{will go to the}} fire-recall floor. However, if the alarm was activated on the fire-recall floor, the elevator will have an alternate floor to recall to. When the elevator is recalled, it proceeds to the recall floor and stops with its doors open. The elevator will no longer respond to calls or move in any direction. Located on the fire-recall floor is a fire-service key switch. The fire-service key switch has the ability to turn fire service off, turn fire service on or to bypass fire service. The only way to return the elevator to normal service is to switch it to bypass after the <b>alarms</b> have <b>reset.</b>|$|R
