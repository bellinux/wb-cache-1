5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} {{in the blue}} wildebeest is 58. Chromosomes were studied in a male and a female wildebeest. In the female, all except a pair of very large submetacentric chromosomes {{were found to be}} <b>acrocentric.</b> Metaphases were studied in the male's chromosomes, and very large submetacentric chromosomes were found there as well, similar to those in the female both in size and morphology. the rest were <b>acrocentric.</b> The X chromosome is a large <b>acrocentric</b> while the Y chromosome a minute one.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} contains 52chromosomes with a {{total of}} 58major arms (2n=52, FN=58). The non-sex chromosomes (autosomes) are mostly <b>acrocentric,</b> having a long and a short arm, or telocentric, having only one arm, but there are also three large metacentric pairs, which have two major arms, and a small metacentric pair. The Y chromosome is metacentric and the X chromosome is variable, ranging from nearly metacentric to <b>acrocentric</b> in five specimens studied.|$|E
5|$|The addax has 29 {{pairs of}} {{chromosomes}}. All chromosomes are <b>acrocentric</b> {{except for the}} first pair of autosomes, which are submetacentric. The X chromosome is {{the largest of the}} <b>acrocentric</b> chromosomes, and the Y chromosome is medium-sized. The short and long arms of the pair of submetacentric autosomes correspond respectively to the 27th and 1st chromosomes in cattle and goats. In a study, the banding patterns of chromosomes in addax were found to be similar to those in four other species of the subfamily Hippotraginae.|$|E
5|$|The {{dromedary}} has 74 diploid chromosomes, {{the same}} as other camelids. The autosomes consist of five pairs of small to medium-sized metacentrics and submetacentrics.

40|$|The {{karyotype}} of a {{fish species}} belonging to the family Scoloplacidae, Scoloplax distolothrix, is described for the first time. Cytogenetic studies showed that this species has 2 n= 50 chromosomes, 18 metacentrics, 18 submetacentrics, 10 subtelocentrics and 4 <b>acrocentrics.</b> The Ag-NORs are restricted to a single large metacentric pair in the interstitial position on the long arm. © 2006 The Japan Mendel Society...|$|R
5|$|The {{karyotype}} generally includes 56chromosomes with a {{total of}} 54major arms (2n=56, FN=54) in specimens from both Bolivia and Brazil; a poorly prepared Paraguayan specimen seems to have a similar karyotype. In this karyotype, all autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are <b>acrocentric</b> (with one arm so short as to be almost invisible). However, in two specimens from the Brazilian states of Tocantins and São Paulo, one pair of autosomes contains both an <b>acrocentric</b> and a metacentric chromosome (with two equally long arms), yielding an FN of 55. One arm of the metacentric chromosome consists entirely of heterochromatin. Apparently, a whole heterochromatic arm was added to this chromosome; cases of similar variation are known from the rodents Peromyscus, Clyomys, and Thaptomys. Both sex chromosomes are <b>acrocentric,</b> and X is larger than Y. In addition to heterochromatin near the centromere, the Y chromosome contains two large blocks of heterochromatin on its long arm. The karyotype is closely similar to that of Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E
5|$|The animal has a {{karyotype}} of 46 chromosomes, with a {{total of}} 50 major arms on the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes). The X chromosome is submetacentric (with one arm slightly longer than the other) and the Y chromosome is small and <b>acrocentric</b> (with one very short and one long arm). The karyotype is conserved among species of Miniopterus; the number of chromosomes and arms is identical in M.griveaudi, the Malagasy M.aelleni and M.gleni, and even the Asian M.fuliginosus.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} of Drymoreomys albimaculatus is 2n=62, FN=62: {{the animal}} has 62 chromosomes, and 29 pairs of autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are <b>acrocentric</b> (with one arm so short {{as to be}} almost invisible) and one small pair is metacentric (with two equally long arms). Both sex chromosomes are submetacentric (with one arm noticeably longer than the other), and X is larger than Y. Blocks of heterochromatin are present on all autosomes and the long arm of Y. Telomeric sequences are found near the centromeres of the sex chromosomes. Aspects of this karyotype—with {{a high number of}} mostly <b>acrocentric</b> chromosomes and the presence of heterochromatin on the Y chromosome—are consistent with the pattern seen in other oryzomyines. However, no other oryzomyine has exactly the same karyotype as D. albimaculatus. Other species in clade D have fewer chromosomes, down to 16 in Nectomys palmipes, although the karyotype of Eremoryzomys polius is unknown. This suggests an evolutionary trend of decreasing chromosome number within the clade.|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} of karyotype {{evolution in the}} superfamily Chalcidoidea is given. Structural types of chromosome sets in the superfamily are listed. Main pathways of karyotypic change in the Chalcidoidea are outlined. The chromosome set containing eleven subtelo- or <b>acrocentrics</b> is considered as an ancestral karyotype for the superfamily. Multiple independent reductions in n values through chromosomal fusions presumably occurred in various groups of chalcid families...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} 'generalised distances' {{was applied to}} characterise the {{relative}} position of the metaphase chromosomes in a population of XXY subjects (180 metaphases from 28 subjects). The most striking observation was {{that the presence of}} an extra gonosome coincided with a disturbance of the normally stable centromere-centre distribution pattern. The distribution analysis gave no clear cut evidence for the induction of gonosomal trisomy XXY by chromosome association. No significant association was observed between X and X or X and Y but there was a smaller distance between X and Y in XXY karyotypes than in XY karyotypes. As far as autosomes are concerned, the XXY karyotypes were characterised by a less central location of the <b>acrocentrics</b> without a clear decrease of association frequencies of these <b>acrocentrics,</b> and the C heterochromatin rich chromosomes were more often associated than in the XX and XY control populations. These data do not support the idea that gonosomal trisomies result from chromosome associations, but favour the hypothesis that spindle degeneration as a result of intrafollicular ageing of C heterochromatin polymorphism may be responsible for non-disjunctions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the cytogenetic {{investigation of the}} Croatian endemic species Fibigia triquetra (DC.) Boiss. (Brassicaceae). The number of chromosomes in all investigated cells from three populations of Fibigia triquetra was 2 n= 2 x=! 6. Chromosomes were small and ranged from submetacentrics to <b>acrocentrics.</b> One chromosome pair had a relatively small satellite. Although meiosis was not completely regular, irregularities were not very frequent. Low pollen germination rate was probably due to these irregularities. As the species is perennial, weakness of seed germination seems not to be important for its survival...|$|R
5|$|The {{karyotype}} includes 80 chromosomes with a {{total of}} 86 major arms (2n=80; FN=86). The X chromosome is subtelocentric (with one pair of long arms and one pair of short arms) and the Y chromosome is <b>acrocentric</b> (with only one pair of arms, or with a minute second pair). Among the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), the four metacentric or submetacentric (with two pairs of arms as long as or not much shorter than the other) pairs of chromosomes are small, and the 35 pairs of acrocentrics range from large to small. Some of those have a minute second pair of arms and could also be classified as subtelocentric, which would raise FN to 90. This karyotype is similar to other known karyotypes of members of Euryoryzomys.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} in T.talamancae is variable. Samples {{from two}} different localities in Venezuela have 34chromosomes and a fundamental number of 64 chromosomal arms (2n=34, FN=64). Four specimens from another Venezuelan locality each have a different karyotype, {{with the number of}} chromosomes ranging from 40 to 42 and the fundamental number from 66 to perhaps 67. The autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) of the 2n=34 karyotype all have two major arms, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes include several <b>acrocentric</b> autosomes, which only have one major arm. The 2n=34 karyotype includes two large submetacentric pairs, which have two long arms but one distinctly longer than the other, and one pair of subtelocentric chromosomes, with a long and a much shorter arm, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes lack the submetacentrics and have another pair of subtelocentrics. Both Robertsonian translocations (fusions of the long arm of one chromosome with the long arm of another and the short arm of the one with the short arm of the other) and pericentric inversions (reversals of part of a chromosome that includes the centromere) are needed to explain {{the difference between the two}} groups. Musser and colleagues, in discussing these karyotypes, assumed that the 2n=40–42 sample was from within a hybrid zone between two karyotypic morphs.|$|E

40|$|The karyomorphology of Glossogobius giuris (Gobiidae) {{obtained}} from Lake Taal and some rivers of Cavite in Luzon Island, Philippines was described. Metaphase chromosome analysis (colchicine-sodium citrate-Carnoy's fixation-Giemsa staining procedures) of the hematopoitetic {{cells in the}} anterior kidneys revealed that the diploid chromosome number was 2 n= 46 (46 A). Fundamental Number (FN) is also 46, since all chromosomal morphology were <b>acrocentrics</b> without any distinguishable heteromorphic pair of chromosomes in the metaphase spreads from {{both dry and wet}} preparations.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of a compound metacentric fourth chromosome (see PDF) has been examined to determine whether arm length or total length {{is the basis for}} recognition in distributive pairing. Recognition was judged by the frequency with which the (see PDF) nondisjoined from a series of X duplications (Dp), ranging in size from ≤ 0. 3 to > 4 times the size of a single fourth chromosome. Dp, (see PDF) nondisjunction was measured in the absence and {{in the presence of a}} competitor, a compound metacentric X. In both situations, total length and not arm length, was found to confer the characteristic recognition property to the (see PDF). A comparison of Dp, (see PDF) nondisjunction curves for both the noncompetitive and competitive situations with analogous Dp, 4 curves previously obtained, show the Dp, (see PDF) curves to be similar in shape to those obtained earlier but displaced one unit to the right, corresponding precisely to the difference in size between the (see PDF) and the 4. Rules governing chromosome recognition for <b>acrocentrics</b> were found completely applicable to metacentrics; disjunctive {{behavior of}} metacentrics differed from that of <b>acrocentrics</b> in that two arms conferred on a chromosome the capacity to act as the intermediate of a trivalent when size no longer warranted this attribute. This capacity, itself, is size-dependent...|$|R

25|$|The {{fundamental}} number, FN, of a karyotype is {{the number}} of visible major chromosomal arms per set of chromosomes. Thus, FN ≤ 2 x 2n, the difference depending on the number of chromosomes considered single-armed (<b>acrocentric</b> or telocentric) present. Humans have FN = 82, due to the presence of five <b>acrocentric</b> chromosome pairs: 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A {{group of}} trout that reside in streams of the desiccating lake basins of southeastern Oregon differ {{markedly}} from other known Salmo. Known commonly as the red-band trout, this fish {{was subjected to}} chromosome analysis for comparison with other species of western North American Salmo. The karyotype of the red-banded trout is 2 n = 58 composed of 44 metacentrics, 2 metacentrics with satallites, 2 sub-metacentrics and 10 <b>acrocentrics</b> to give 104 chromosome arms. This karyotype is identical {{to that of the}} California golden trout, S. a. guabonita. A similar karyotype has been found, for trout from the Deschutes River and summer-run steelhead from the Siletz and Clearwater rivers. The chromosomal and distributional data is believed to indicate a widespread golden trout complex composed of the red-band trout, the California golden trout, and the Kern River trout inhabiting the Pacific Coast drainage from British Columbia to southern California. In the course of this study, a new karyotype was discovered for the Alvord cutthroat trout of 2 n = 64 with 40 metacentrics and 24 <b>acrocentrics</b> to give 104 chromosome arms. Nineteen enzyme systems were analysed by starch-gel electrophoresis in two populations of the red-band trout. The Bridge Creek population displayed very low variability for only malate dehydroge, nase (MDH) and phosphoglucomutase (PGM). No variability was found in the Three-Mile Creek population. A new allele, not previously reported was found for MDH in the Bridge Creek population. The high degree of genetic similarity among and between these populations is thought {{to be the result of}} selection pressure rather than stochastic processes. The isolated populations of the red-banded trout appear to be well adapted to their present environment, but without the genetic variability to meet future environmental changes, they may face extinction. Their most immediate threat is man' s use of the environment...|$|R
40|$|Transmission ratio {{distortion}} (TRD) {{is defined}} as a significant departure from expected Mendelian ratios of inheritance of an allele or chromosome. TRD is observed among specific regions of the mouse and human genome and is frequently associated with chromosome rearrangements such as Robertsonian (Rb) chromosomes. We intercrossed mice heterozygous for a (7. 18) Rb translocation and genotyped chromosomes 7 and 18 in 1812 individuals, 47 % of which were informative for chromosome segregation. We substantiated previous findings that females were less likely than expected to transmit the Rb chromosome to their offspring. Surprisingly, however, we report that heterozygous males transmitted the Rb translocation chromosome significantly more frequently than the <b>acrocentrics.</b> The transmission of the Rb chromosome was not significantly influenced by either the sex of the Rb grandparent or the strain of the Rb...|$|R

25|$|Several chromosome-banding {{techniques}} {{are used in}} cytogenetics laboratories. Quinacrine banding (Q-banding) was the first staining method used to produce specific banding patterns. This method requires a fluorescence microscope {{and is no longer}} as widely used as Giemsa banding (G-banding). Reverse banding, or R-banding, requires heat treatment and reverses the usual black-and-white pattern that is seen in G-bands and Q-bands. This method is particularly helpful for staining the distal ends of chromosomes. Other staining techniques include C-banding and nucleolar organizing region stains (NORstains). These latter methods specifically stain certain portions of the chromosome. C-banding stains the constitutive heterochromatin, which usually lies near the centromere, and NORstaining highlights the satellites and stalks of <b>acrocentric</b> chromosomes.|$|E
