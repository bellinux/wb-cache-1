5|$|In early 1942, Zyklon B {{emerged as}} the {{preferred}} killing tool of Nazi Germany for use in extermination camps during the Holocaust. The chemical was used to kill roughly one million people in gas chambers installed in extermination camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and elsewhere. Most {{of the victims were}} Jews, and by far the majority killed using this method died at Auschwitz. Zyklon B was supplied to concentration camps at Mauthausen, Dachau, and Buchenwald by the distributor Heli, and to Auschwitz and Majdanek by Testa. Camps also occasionally bought Zyklon B directly from the manufacturers. Of the 729 metric tons of Zyklon B sold in Germany in 1942–44, 56 metric tons (about 8 per cent of domestic sales) were sold to concentration camps. Auschwitz received 23.8 tons, of which 6 tons were used for fumigation. The remainder was used in the gas chambers or lost to spoilage (the product had a stated shelf life of only three months). Testa conducted fumigations for the Wehrmacht and supplied them with Zyklon B. They also offered courses to the SS in the safe handling and use of the material for fumigation purposes. In April 1941, the German agriculture and interior ministries designated the SS as an authorized <b>applier</b> of the chemical, and thus they were able to use it without any further training or governmental oversight.|$|E
50|$|The <b>applier</b> grasps {{the clip}} {{and holds the}} legs open {{by way of a}} drop lock on its {{proximal}} end. The drop lock is automatically released when the <b>applier</b> is compressed. Shortly after its invention, a California surgeon called in desperate hopes of securing the clips in time to use them during an upcoming operation on actress Patricia Neal. Mayfield told the surgeon to contact the props man on the set of the TV show, Ben Casey, where their use had been featured in a recent episode.|$|E

40|$|Earlier {{studies by}} our group {{suggested}} {{the possibility that}} offspring of pesticide <b>appliers</b> might have increased risks of birth anomalies. To evaluate this hypothesis, 935 births to 34, 772 state-licensed, private pesticide <b>appliers</b> in Minnesota occurring between 1989 and 1992 were linked to the Minnesota state birth registry containing 210, 723 live births in this timeframe. The birth defect rate for all birth anomalies was significantly increased in children born to private <b>appliers.</b> Specific birth defect categories, circulatory/respiratory, urogenital, and musculoskeletal/integumental, showed significant increases. For the general population and for <b>appliers,</b> the birth anomaly rate differed by corp-growing region. Western Minnesota, a major wheat, sugar beet, and potato growing region, showed {{the highest rate of}} birth anomalies per/ 1000 live births: 30. 0 for private <b>appliers</b> versus 26. 9 for the general population of the same region. The lowest rates, 23. 7 / 1000 for private <b>appliers</b> versus 18. 3 / 1000 for the general population, occurred in noncorp regions. The highest frequency of use of chlorophenoxy herbicides and fungicides also occurred in western Minnesota. Births in the general population of western Minnesota showed a significant increase in birth anomalies in the same three birth anomaly categories as <b>appliers</b> and for central nervous system anomalies. This increase was most pronounced for infants conceived in the spring. The seasonal effect did not occur in other regions. The male/female sex ratio for the four birth anomaly categories of interest in areas of high phenoxy herbicide/fungicide use is 2. 8 for <b>appliers</b> versus 1. 5 for the general population of the same region (p = 0. 05). In minimal use regions, this ratio is 2. 1 for <b>appliers</b> versus 1. 7 for the general population. The pattern of excess frequency of birth anomalies by pesticide use, season, and alteration of sex ratio suggests exposure-related effects in <b>appliers</b> and the general population of the crop-growing region of western Minnesota...|$|R

5000|$|Laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} is {{the most}} common laparoscopic procedure performed. In this procedure, 5-10 mm diameter instruments (graspers, scissors, clip <b>applier)</b> can be introduced by the surgeon into the abdomen through trocars (hollow tubes with a seal to keep the [...] from leaking). Over one million cholecystectomies are performed in the U.S. annually, with over 96% of those being performed laparoscopically.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1990, {{the only}} {{specialty}} performing laparoscopy on a widespread basis was gynecology, mostly for relatively short, simple procedures {{such as a}} diagnostic laparoscopy or tubal ligation. The introduction in 1990 of a laparoscopic clip <b>applier</b> with twenty automatically advancing clips (rather than a single load clip <b>applier</b> {{that would have to}} be taken out, reloaded and reintroduced for each clip application) made general surgeons more comfortable with making the leap to laparoscopic cholecystectomies (gall bladder removal). On the other hand, some surgeons continue to use the single clip appliers as they save as much as $200 per case for the patient, detract nothing from the quality of the clip ligation, and add only seconds to case lengths. It must be noted that both laparoscopy tubal ligations and cholecystectomies may be performed using suturing and tying, thus further reducing the expensive cost of single and multiclips (when compared to suture). Once again this may increase case lengths but costs are greatly reduced (ideal for developing countries) and widespread accidents of loose clips are eliminated.|$|E

5000|$|The conk (derived from congolene, a hair {{straightener}} gel made from lye) was a hairstyle popular among African-American {{men from the}} 1920s to the 1960s. This hairstyle called {{for a man with}} naturally [...] "kinky" [...] hair to have it chemically straightened using a relaxer (sometimes the pure corrosive chemical lye), so that the newly straightened hair could be styled in specific ways. Often, the relaxer was made at home, by mixing lye, eggs, and potatoes, the <b>applier</b> having to wear gloves and the receiver's head having to be rinsed thoroughly after application to avoid chemical burns. Conks were often styled as large pompadours although other men chose to simply slick their straightened hair back, allowing it to lie flat on their heads. Regardless of the styling, conks required a considerable amount of effort to maintain: a man often had to wear a do-rag of some sort at home, to absorb sweat or other agents from causing his hair to revert to its natural state prematurely. Also, the style required repeated application of relaxers; as new hair grew in, it too had to be chemically straightened.|$|E

40|$|This Article scrutinizes varying interpretive methodologies used by {{different}} tribunals of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ("ICSID") {{in relation to}} Article XI of the US-Argentina bilateral investment treaty ("BIT"), which, in different degrees, had referred to the customary doctrine of "necessity" to derive Article XI's substantive meaning and legal effects.

The system uses nonpenetrating clips to approximate everted vessel walls. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of nonpenetrating vascular clips on endothelial wound healing. Aortic end-to-end anastomoses were performed in male Wistar rats. A comparison was made between clipped (n = 12) and conventional hand-sewn (n = 6) anastomoses. Patency rates were verified at different time intervals (after 1, 4, and 8 weeks), after which the anastomotic sites were removed. Morphological evaluation was carried out using scanning electron microscopy, All rats survived the procedure. Closure with clips took less time than closure with conventional sutures, with decreasing aortic clamping times for the clipped procedures during the course of the experiments. Patency rates were 100 % in both the "clipped" and "sutured" groups. Microscopic examination showed favorable endothelial healing at the clipped anastomotic sites, with less inflammatory reaction at 1 week, and a more complete endothelial regeneration at 4 and 8 weeks follow-up, as compared with the sutured anastomoses. The clip <b>applier</b> holds the promise of a useful device in anastomosing small-caliber vessels, since clip closure takes less time than suturing, while patency rates are identical, and morphological results are favorable.
