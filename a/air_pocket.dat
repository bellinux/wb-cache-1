5|$|Anna Elisabeth Johansson Bågenholm (born 1970) is a Swedish {{radiologist}} from Vänersborg, {{who survived}} after a skiing accident in 1999 left her trapped under {{a layer of}} ice for 80minutes in freezing water. During this time she became a victim of extreme hypothermia and her body temperature decreased to , {{one of the lowest}} survived body temperatures ever recorded in a human with accidental hypothermia. Bågenholm was able to find an <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> under the ice, but suffered circulatory arrest after 40minutes in the water.|$|E
5|$|Falkenberg and Næsheim {{held onto}} Bågenholm's skis {{as they waited}} for the rescue teams to arrive. At first Bågenholm {{struggled}} in the cold water before she found an <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> and was able to remain conscious for 40minutes before becoming a victim of circulatory arrest. Ketil Singstad led the rescue team {{from the top of the}} mountain. He skied as fast as he could to Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to pull her out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow shovel could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a pointed gardening shovel. They were able to cut a hole in the ice, and pulled her through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of hemmed edges: closed hems and open hems. Closed hems are {{completely}} flush while open hems have an <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> in the bend. The major difference is that the tonnage required for a closed hem is much greater than that for an open hem.|$|E
40|$|A 30 -year-old man {{presented}} with headache, vomiting, altered sensorium and seizures. There was {{no history of}} trauma or surgery. On examination, he was unconscious with signs of meningeal irritation and asymmetrical pupils. Computed tomography (CT) scan of brain revealed pneumocephalus. He died immediately after the CT scan. He was later found to be immunocompetent. Computed tomography scan (figures 1 and 2) showed moderate dilatation of lateral ventricles with intraventricular <b>air</b> <b>pockets,</b> small bilateral intracranial <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> in the sulci. The CT features were suggestive of meningitis with ventriculitis. Figure 1 : Computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain.

30|$|The {{difference}} {{resides in}} the fact while the size of <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> are large initially on all superhydrophobic surfaces, which {{gives rise to the}} high water contact angles, the stability of these larger <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> can be fine-tuned by surface roughness. According to this theory, it seems to suggest that the significant variation in surface coverage by biofilms between surfaces with different pore sizes {{can be attributed to the}} relative stability of larger <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> retained on the surface. While the mechanism behind this difference is still under investigation, the presence of <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> and its morphology has a significant influence over the settlement behaviour of Amphora coffeaeformis.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Air</b> <b>pockets,</b> {{one kind}} of {{concrete}} surface defects, are often created on formed concrete surfaces during concrete construction. Their existence undermines the desired appearance and visual uniformity of architectural concrete. Therefore, measuring the impact of <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> on the concrete surface {{in the form of}} <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> is vital in assessing the quality of architectural concrete. Traditionally, such measurements are mainly based on in-situ manual inspections, the results of which are subjective and heavily dependent on the inspectors’ own criteria and experience. Often, inspectors may make different assessments even when inspecting the same concrete surface. In addition, the need for experienced inspectors costs owners or general contractors more in inspection fees. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents a methodology that can measure <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> quantitatively and automatically. In order to achieve this goal, a high contrast, scaled image of a concrete surface is acquired from a fixed distance range and then a spot filter is used to accurately detect <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> {{with the help of an}} image pyramid. The properties of <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> (the number, the size, and the occupation area of <b>air</b> <b>pockets)</b> are subsequently calculated. These properties are used to quantify the impact of <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> on the architectural concrete surface. The methodology is implemented in a C++ based prototype and tested on a database of concrete surface images. Comparisons with manual tests validated its measuring accuracy. As a result, the methodology presented in this paper can increase the reliability of concrete surface quality assessment...|$|R
25|$|Pusher Finn capsized {{along with}} the barge Baltic outside Hanko, Finland, on 27 December 1990 at around 12:25 (UTC+02). The pusher-barge {{combination}} Finn-Baltic was en route from Raahe to Koverhar with 13,398 tons of Malmberget A Fines (MAF) iron ore concentrate when the cargo shifted in heavy weather, resulting {{in the loss of}} stability and the vessel capsizing in 10–15 seconds. Seven crew members and a pilot lost their lives in the accident, but the chief engineer and first officer survived in an <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> in the aftmost part of the engine room and were later rescued through a hole cut in the bottom.|$|E
25|$|On 27 December 1990 {{the vessel}} capsized {{along with the}} barge Baltic outside Hanko, Finland, while en route from Raahe to Koverhar in {{southern}} Finland with a cargo of iron ore concentrate. The cargo shifted in heavy weather, resulting {{in the loss of}} stability and the vessel capsizing in 10–15 seconds. Seven crew members and a pilot lost their lives in the accident, but the chief engineer and chief officer survived in an <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> in the aftmost part of the engine room and were later rescued through a hole cut in the bottom. The combination was later rightened and towed to Rauma for rebuilding. Finn returned to service as Steel and Baltic as Botnia in 1991.|$|E
25|$|In March 1945, 87 POWs from Island Farm escaped {{through a}} tunnel, but all were recaptured. While Bridgend was as {{important}} {{during the war}} as {{any other part of}} Wales, and although it was photographed by the Luftwaffe, it was never blitzed, although the area immediately around Bridgend did suffer bombing raids. This was largely due to the area's <b>air</b> <b>pocket,</b> which made bombing extremely hazardous for incoming planes. The close proximity of the POW camp at Island Farm may also have been a deterrent. Unlike Bridgend, neither Swansea nor Cardiff escaped such massive attacks. Had Bridgend been bombed, it would have likely been a massive blow to munitions supplies to the allies and could have changed {{the course of the war}} in the Axis' favour.|$|E

25|$|A {{similar study}} was {{conducted}} by Nielsen and other associates with another Australian mangrove ant, Polyrhachis sokolova. This mangrove species {{has been known to}} use the front four legs as oars and the back two legs as rudders in order to swim back to the nest directly before inundation. At this point, the ants retreat into their nest in the mud, which creates an <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> and blocks out the incoming tide. The question was again raised about the ant’s source of air, and the study on carbon dioxide levels in the nests of Polyrhachis sokolova was conducted. The experiment concluded with results similar to the study of Camponotus anderseni nests with evidence that the ants had achieved anerobic respiration.|$|E
25|$|Fog, turbulence, and {{darkness}} altered the refueling schedule, shortening some contacts and delaying others. On six occasions the Question Mark was forced {{away from its}} flight track to refuel, once over Oceanside and five times over El Centro. Maintaining contact formation became more difficult as {{the weight of the}} planes changed during transfer, especially since the refueling pilot could not observe the Question Mark. On January 4, after the aircraft rendezvoused over the Imperial Valley, both nearly impacted the ground when they encountered an unexpected <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> while refueling. Hoyt developed a system whereby Woodring tugged on a string tied to the pilot's arm if the C-1's speed was excessive. Early in the flight a window blew out of the C-2's cabin, but a replacement was eventually hauled up and installed by Hooe. A leak in a fuel line was repaired using a mixture of red lead, soap, and shellac hauled up by tanker.|$|E
25|$|Those aboard Collapsible B {{suffered}} greatly {{during the}} night. The boat gradually sank lower {{into the water}} as the <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> underneath it leaked away. The sea began to get up towards dawn, causing the boat to rock in the swell and lose more of its precious air. Lightoller organised {{the men on the}} hull to stand in two parallel rows {{on either side of the}} centreline, facing the bow, and got them to sway in unison to counteract the rocking motion caused by the swell. They were directly exposed to the freezing seawater, first up to their feet, then to their ankles and finally to their knees as the boat subsided in the water. For some, the ordeal proved too much and one by one they collapsed, fell into the water and died. The victims possibly included John George Phillips, the first radio officer, and the third class passenger David Livshin, whose body was taken to the Carpathia on the following morning. About 30 people were left alive by the morning and were transferred into other lifeboats before being rescued by Carpathia.|$|E
40|$|We present AirCode, a {{technique}} that allows the user to tag physically fabricated objects with given information. An AirCode tag consists {{of a group of}} carefully designed <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> placed beneath the object surface. These <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> are easily produced during the fabrication process of the object, without any additional material or postprocessing. Meanwhile, the <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> affect only the scattering light transport under the surface, and thus are hard to notice to our naked eyes. But, by using a computational imaging method, the tags become detectable. We present a tool that automates the design of <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> for the user to encode information. AirCode system also allows the user to retrieve the information from captured images via a robust decoding algorithm. We demonstrate our tagging technique with applications for metadata embedding, robotic grasping, as well as conveying object affordances. Comment: ACM UIST 2017 Technical Paper...|$|R

50|$|If {{rocks are}} used, it is {{important}} not to use river rocks, or other kinds of rocks with <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> inside them. Rocks must be completely dry before heating. Rocks with <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> or excessive moisture could crack and possibly explode in the fire or when hit by water. Previously used rocks may absorb humidity or moisture leading to cracks or shattering.|$|R
25|$|By 2:15a.m., Lightoller, Moody {{and others}} were {{struggling}} to retrieve Collapsible Boats A and B from their places of storage {{on the roof of}} the officers' quarters. They rigged up makeshift ramps from oars and spars down which they slid the boats onto the Boat Deck. Unfortunately for all concerned, the boat broke through the ramp and landed upside-down on the deck. It reached the Boat Deck upside-down but there was no time to right it as Titanic began her final break-up and plunge to the seabed. Water swept across the Boat Deck, washing the upside-down lifeboat and many people into the sea. Wireless operator Harold Bride found himself trapped underneath the overturned hull. Titanics increasing angle in the water and an opening expansion joint caused the stays supporting the forward funnel to snap and crash into the water, crushing swimmers in its path and pushing Collapsible B away from the sinking ship. As Titanic went under, the lifeboat was left in the midst of hundreds of people swimming in the water. Several dozen people climbed onto its hull, including Lightoller, who then took charge of it. Also aboard were Jack Thayer (whose mother was saved with her maid in Boat #4, but whose father died), military historian Colonel Archibald Gracie, who later wrote a popular account of the disaster, and Chief Baker Charles Joughin. Bride managed to escape from the <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> beneath the boat and made it onto the hull.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Superboy's only superpower is a telekinetic {{force field}} that {{surrounds}} {{his body and}} granted him abilities that approximated some of Superman's powers such as super strength, flight and invulnerability. The field allowed Superboy to lift heavy objects by extending the field around him and deflecting any solid object that {{came into contact with}} him. The field also allowed Superboy the ability to manipulate objects that he came into tactile contact with, bend them into any shape that he could visualize mentally, and disassemble things such as machines and other complex constructions by touch. Under Knockout's training, Superboy learned new ways to use his tactile telekinesis such as projecting telekinetic force waves to blast pieces of ground and extending his field to another person. Superboy can also manipulate solid masses such as volumes of sand or dust causing the individual particles to fly apart in an explosive manner to create particle clouds or a forceful attack. He can also perform the same with solid masses that are splintered, such as a cracked slab of concrete or fractured pane of glass. The telekinetic field also lets Superboy break free of an opponent's grip by pushing the field outward to force the opponent away and he is also able to create an <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> around himself enabling him to breathe in outer space. In addition, he demonstrated the ability to extend his telekinetic field around other people that he touches to make them invulnerable. He also learned a trick from his older and more experienced alternate self, Black Zero, that allowed him to freeze people where they stood if he was touching the same surface that they were standing on.|$|E

500|$|A {{series of}} public demonstrations were planned in Australia {{to assist in}} fund-raising, {{the first of which}} was {{scheduled}} for 5 October 1911 at the Cheltenham Racecourse in Adelaide. During a test flight the day before, excessive pressure in the fuel tank caused it to rupture, almost blinding Watkins. That problem resolved, Watkins took Frank Wild, whom Mawson had hired to command a support base during the expedition, on another test flight the morning of the demonstration. In Watkins' account, which he addressed to Vickers' Aviation Department, he wrote: [...] " [...] about 200 ft. up. I got into a fierce tremor, and then into an <b>air</b> <b>pocket,</b> and was brought down about 100 ft., got straight, and dropped into another, almost a vacuum. That finished it. We hit the ground with an awful crash, both wings damaged, one cylinder broken, and the Nose bent up, the tail in half, etc." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the flying}} sections, the player {{controls}} Nights' flight along a predetermined route through each Mare, resembling {{that of a}} 2D platformer. The player has only a limited period of time available before Nights {{falls to the ground}} and transforms back into Claris or Elliot, and each collision with an enemy subtracts five seconds from the time remaining. While flying, Nights can use a boost to travel faster, as well as defeat certain reverie enemies scattered throughout the level. Grabbing onto certain enemies causes Nights to spin around, which will launch both Nights and the enemy in the direction the boost was initiated. Various acrobatic manoeuvres can be performed, including the [...] "Paraloop", whereby flying around in a complete circle and connecting the trail of stars left in Nights' wake will cause any items within the loop to be attracted towards Nights. The game features a combo system known as [...] "Linking", whereby actions such as collecting items and flying through rings are worth more points when performed in quick succession. Power-ups may be gained by flying through several predetermined rings, which will be indicated by a bonus barrel. The power-ups include a speed boost, point multiplier and an <b>air</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{the other}} boats, {{there was nothing}} the {{survivors}} could do but await the arrival of rescue ships. The air was bitterly cold {{and several of the}} boats had taken on water. The survivors could not find any food or drinkable water in the boats, and most had no lights. The situation was particularly bad aboard collapsible B, which was only kept afloat by a diminishing <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> in the upturned hull. As dawn approached, the wind rose and the sea became increasingly choppy, forcing those on the collapsible boat to stand up to balance it. Some, exhausted by the ordeal, fell off into the sea and were drowned. It became steadily harder for the rest to keep their balance on the hull, with waves washing across it. Archibald Gracie later wrote of how he and the other survivors sitting on the upturned hull were struck by [...] "the utter helplessness of our position." [...] Some swimmers who had reached collapsible A had not enough strength to come aboard, and had to cling to the boat's sides. The bodies {{of the majority of the}} people who died during the night were lowered into the sea to make more room for the survivors.|$|E

50|$|Defects {{known as}} voids and dry resin (in {{the case of}} resin {{transfer}} molding) are possible in transfer molding and often are exacerbated by high viscosity materials.

40|$|Purpose: To {{retrospectively}} {{assess the}} incidence {{and magnitude of}} <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> around vaginal cylinders {{and its impact on}} dose distribution in vaginal cuff image-guided high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Material and methods: Fifty endometrial carcinoma patients treated by postoperative HDR vaginal cuff brachyther-apy were included in the study. The average age of patients was 58. 3 ± 11. 8 years (range: 31 - 87 years). Brachytherapy was performed using cylindrical applicators, and the dose prescribed to 0. 5 cm from the applicator’s surface, over a length of 5 cm from the applicator’s tip. Computed tomography (CT) simulation was used for each brachytherapy fraction. The incidence, vaginal mucosa displacement, volume, and dosimetric effect of <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> around the vaginal cylinder were evaluated. Results: A total of 78 <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> were found in 29 / 50 patients (58 %) and 45 / 135 (33 %) brachytherapy plans. They were located at the apex: 16 / 78 (20 %) and lateral to the applicator: 62 / 78 (80 %). The volume of <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> ranged be-tween 0. 01 and 2. 1 cm 3 (mean: 0. 15 cm 3 ± 0. 36 cm 3), and the maximum displacement of vaginal mucosa from cylinder surface was between 0. 1 and 1. 09 cm (mean: 0. 34 cm ± 0. 2 cm). The dose reduction to the vaginal mucosa generated by the <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> ranged from 0. 5 to 66 % (mean: 26. 4 % ± 13. 9 %). Conclusions: The presence of <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> around vaginal cylinder applicators is frequently noticed in post-operative vaginal cuff brachytherapy. The dose to the vaginal mucosa is reduced, as a result of displacement generated by air pock-ets. The effect on the clinical outcome of this dose reduction is yet to be determined...|$|R
