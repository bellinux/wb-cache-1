5000|$|Epiphanius {{uses the}} {{spelling}} nasaraioi (Νασαραῖοι), which {{he attempts to}} distinguish from the spelling nazoraios {{in parts of the}} New Testament, as a Jewish-Christian sect. According to the testimony of Epiphanius against the 4th century Nazarenes, he reports them as having pre-Christian origins. He writes: [...] "(6,1) They did not call themselves Nasaraeans either; the Nasaraean sect was before Christ, and did not know Christ. 6,2 But besides, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>indicated,</b> everyone called the Christians Nazoraeans," [...] (Adversus Haereses, 29.6). The sect was apparently centered in the areas of Coele-Syria, Galilee and Samaria, essentially corresponding to the long-defunct Kingdom of Israel. According to Epiphanius they rejected temple sacrifice and the Law of Moses, but adhered to other Jewish practices. They are described as being vegetarian. According to him they were Jews only by nationality who lived in Gilead, Basham, and the Transjordan. They revered Moses but, unlike the pro-Torah Nazoraeans, believed he had received different laws from those accredited to him.|$|E

I am still willing, perfectly willing, to go forward with this attempt to testify, although I will not be willing to testify about actions and activities of other people. I will be willing to testify about my own actions and my own activities because I am proud of them. However, as I tried to indicate earlier, I am very concerned about the general atmosphere in which these hearings are being conducted, both inside and outside this hearing room. I am very concerned about the kind of actions that the committee and law enforcement officers, or people who should be enforcing the law, have taken against myself, attorneys, other witnesses, colleagues of mine that have appeared or tried to appear before this committee……..

40|$|Many years ago, I can {{remember}} being singularly impressed with a photographic exhibition which came, on tour, {{to the small}} country town in which I was living. This exhibition contained very powerful,exemplars of the human condition. Photographs of people in various cultq'res, drawn from various socio-economic groups, ranging in all ages from the very young to the very old depicted universal themes such as birth, innocence, poverty, joy, pain, death, faith, hope. The exhibition was called "The Family of Man " and its theme seemed to be that, despite man's diversity- racially, geographically, socially, economically, politically- there was an essence which could transcend difference and distil the essential under-lying quality that signified man- whatever his present cultural context.

40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} {{affects a}} significant portion of college-aged individuals, but researchers know little about how the intersection of age, race, class, and gender influence intimate partner violence among community college students in the United States. In this quantitative correlational study, I examined the relationship between intimate partner violence and gender, race, age, class, marital status, and past abuse among community college students using the intersectionality theory. I used the Abusive Behavior Inventory and a demographic survey to collect data via a convenience sample of the target population of men (n = 220) and women (n = 330) attending a community college or recent graduates. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated although no demographic variables were related to the frequency of psychological violence, lower age and higher socioeconomic status were related to increased frequency of physical violence. Individuals aged 18 â?? 24 were more likely than other groups to experience physical violence (t = - 2. 73, p =. 008), and individuals with higher income levels (larger than 50, 000) were more likely than individuals in other socioeconomic statuses to experience physical violence (t = 1. 99, p =. 049). The implications for positive social change include generating data regarding the potential predictive demographic factors that influence intimate partner violence, which may help professional 2 ̆ 7 s complete interventions that address intimate partner violence among community college students.

40|$|The World Trade Report 2004 is {{the second}} annual {{publication}} in the WTO Secretariat’s new series. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>indicated</b> last year, the World Trade Report seeks to deepen public understanding of current trade policy issues and to contribute to more informed consideration of the options facing governments. Like last year, the Report begins with a review of recent world trade developments. This is followed by three shorter essays – on trade preferences, the temporary movement of natural persons, and geographical indications. The main topic of the Report this year is coherence. As far as trade developments are concerned, 2003 was not as bleak a year as many had feared. Trade grew in real terms by 4. 5 per cent, a rate still somewhat below the average for the 1990 s but above what many forecasters had anticipated. These results were largely {{a reflection of a}} pick-up in economic activity {{in the second half of}} the year. Prospects for 2004 look much better than the results for 2003. The Fifth WTO Ministerial Meeting at Cancún was a disappointment to many and did little to bolster business confidence. I fully share what I believe is the widely-held aspiration that signs of renewed commitment to moving the Doha Development Agenda forward will lead to concrete results in the near future. A failure by governments to deliver on the promise of Doha would be a blow to the trading system and would do nothing to support, let alone improve upon, near-term expectations regarding the performance of the worl...|$|E
40|$|I {{would like}} to express to the {{membership}} of the Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) how deeply honored I have been to serve as your 65 th president. This was an unde-served and unexpected privilege. Our specialty is at an inflection point in history occa-sioned by the unanimous approval of subspecialty board certification by the American Board of Surgery. The 21 st century is an exciting time to be a surgical oncologist, with our deeper understanding of cancer biology and a contin-uous pipeline of molecules that target oncogenes and signaling pathways, and enhance antitumor immunity. ROLE MODELS IN MY ACADEMIC CAREER I want to begin my presidential address by thanking two remarkable surgical leaders: Monica Morrow, who will succeed me as president, and Mitch Posner, my immediate predecessor. Many of you already know what I learned over the last year: Monica is hard-working, highly orga-nized, articulate, and purposeful, as well as a preeminent expert in breast diseases. This society has much to look forward to during her presidency. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>indicated</b> last year when I introduced him to you as president, Mitch is the real deal. He is hard-working, a superior clinical surgeon and investigator, a great leader, and a fundamentally decent person. It has been a privilege to have my term flanked by these two fine surgical leaders (Fig. 1). I am indebted to many individuals throughout my career, and I feel obligated to quickly acknowledge them. All were role models; some were mentors. A role model is a person regarded as a good example to follow, whose behavior and quality is worth adopting. Seven faculty at Johns Hopkins had an important impact early in my career: the senior vascular and transplant sur-geon Mel Williams, in whose laboratory I first worked; Mack Holmes and Mike Zinner, on whose services I worked as a medical student; and John Cameron, Saul Roseman, and my PhD advisor, Hyun Shin, and his senio...|$|E

We are convinced intellectually that we inhabit a small provincial planet, but we do not feel in the least suburban.
