5|$|The courts {{recognise}} {{two forms}} of secret trust. Fully secret trusts are trusts not referred to at <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> face of the will. Instead, an agreement made between the testator and trustees elsewhere. The trustee will instead be named only a beneficiary. In {{the case of a}} half-secret trust, the fact that the beneficiary holds as trustee only is declared {{on the face of the}} will, but not the other terms of the trust.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} façade of {{the main}} wing, in the same classical style as its counterpart facing the Ill, is narrower. A strong emphasis is put on the verticality of the windows, by which means the impression of height is accentuated. Again, a central avant-corps is crowned with a triangular pediment bearing reliefs {{and in this case}} also statues. Both façades are richly decorated with allegorical mascarons (depicting seasons, temperaments, continents and elements), eighteen in <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> riverside façade and nine in <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> courtyard façade, to which the riverside façade adds a pair of broad wrought-iron balconies. Due to the difference in width and the trapezoidal plan, the centres of the façades are not aligned.|$|E

5|$|Alabama {{extended}} their lead to 10–0 after Shelley connected on a 24-yard field goal {{early in the}} third quarter. Early in the fourth, Trent Richardson scored on a two-yard run for a 17–0 Crimson Tide lead. However, on the ensuing kickoff was returned 68-yards to the Alabama 22-yard line by John Fulton, and four plays later the Bulldogs cut the score to 17–7 after Tyler Russell threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Chris Smith. The Crimson Tide then closed the game with an eleven-play, 73-yard drive, <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, with Lacy scoring his second touchdown of the night from 32 yards out to give Alabama the 24–7 victory. The 127 rushing yards gained by Richardson was his seventh 100-yard rushing game of the season. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Bulldogs to 74–18–3 (76–17–3 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|At the start, Nico Rosberg {{got around}} the outside of Hamilton in turn one, while Räikkönen lost {{positions}} due to a slow getaway. Sebastian Vettel got past Verstappen, but was immediately repassed on the approach to turn four. At {{the front of the}} race, coming out of turn three, Hamilton tried to retake the position from Rosberg. As the latter defended his position, Hamilton went off the track and spun and they collided at turn 4, ending the race of both Mercedes drivers. The collision resulted in a safety car period, with the order standing: Ricciardo, Verstappen, Sainz, Vettel and Räikkönen. The safety car came in at the end of lap four. Vettel got past Sainz on lap eight and Räikkönen tried to follow suit two laps later, but was forced off track into turn two. He completed the move one lap later at the same spot. Sainz and Button were the first to come into the pit lane for new tyres on lap 12, followed by race leader Ricciardo one lap later, making Verstappen the first Dutchman to lead a Grand Prix, before he came in another lap later. When Vettel made a pit stop on lap 16, he emerged third behind the two Red Bull drivers, <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> medium compound tyre.|$|E

5|$|However, a close {{examination}} of the excavated tracks may give a more differentiated picture. While there is agreement that the grooves {{in the eastern part}} were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels, those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result of wear or do not appear at <b>all.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, the marked cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of the grooves can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the trackway.|$|E

5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1936, water levels in Lake Mead were high enough to permit power generation, and the first three Allis Chalmers built Francis turbine-{{generator}}s, <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Nevada side, began operating. In March 1937, one more Nevada generator went online and the first Arizona generator by August. By September 1939, four more generators were operating, and the dam's power plant became the largest hydroelectricity facility in the world. The final generator was not placed in service until 1961, bringing the maximum generating capacity to 1,345 megawatts at the time. Original plans called for 16large generators, eight {{on each side of the}} river, but two smaller generators were installed instead of one large one on the Arizona side for a total of 17. The smaller generators were used to serve smaller communities at a time when the output of each generator was dedicated to a single municipality, before the dam's total power output was placed on the grid and made arbitrarily distributable. The present contracts for the sale of electricity expire in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Masséna was {{the fourth}} member {{of a group of}} five battleships built to a broadly similar design, but {{different}} enough to be considered unique vessels. The first ship was Charles Martel, which formed the basis for Masséna and three other ships. Design specifications were identical for each of the ships, but different engineers designed each vessel. The ships were based on the previous battleship Brennus, but instead of mounting the main battery <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> centerline, the ships used the lozenge arrangement of the earlier vessel Magenta, which moved two of the main battery guns to single turrets on the wings.

5|$|Paris {{is a city}} {{of books}} and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language {{publishing}} houses were found in Paris, almost <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Left Bank in the 5th, 6th and 7th arrondissements. Since that time, because of high prices, some publishers have moved out to the less expensive areas. It is also a city of small bookstores; There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five percent below their publisher's cover price.|$|E

5|$|Significant {{damage was}} {{reported}} in coastal areas of Grand Bahama Island, with widespread destruction of roofs and vehicles, along with downed poles and trees. Power and telephone services were disrupted throughout the island. A total of 400structures sustained damage, of which about 200commercial buildings were severely damaged and recommended by engineers not to be repaired. Among the destroyed buildings were a police station on the western end and several buildings in Freeport. More than 500automobiles were flooded, including five police cars. The storm surge also raised 54corpses in five graveyards on the island. Several resorts were closed {{for an extended period}} of time, <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western portion of the island. One hotel, the Xanadu Beach and Marine Resort, reported about $3.5million in damage (2005USD), including numerous destroyed windows designed to withstand hurricane-force winds. Further to the east, numerous houses and commercial buildings lost their roofs in the city of Freeport. One serious traffic accident occurred when the winds overturned a bus, inflicting injuries on the driver. Several other traffic accidents were reported in the area, although none were severe. During the passage of the hurricane, five cases of looting were reported, of which one person was caught in the process. Storm surge from the hurricane killed one child, the only casualty directly related to Wilma in the archipelago.|$|E
