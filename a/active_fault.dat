25|$|The Ramapo fault {{goes through}} the county on a northeast–southwest axis. The fault {{separates}} the Highlands from the Piedmont, {{also known as the}} Newark Basin. This is an <b>active</b> <b>fault.</b> The last major earthquake occurred in 1884, with a strength measured at 5.3 on the Richter scale.|$|E

40|$|The {{location}} and continuity of <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> comprising {{a part of}} the Kinki region are clearly expressed in terms of topography. This area is the so-called Kinki Triangle; a region where many of Japan 2 ̆ 7 s <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> are concentrated within the triangle area. This study presents the results of seismic reflection surveys across <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> of the reverse fault systems (Yoro and Katata faults) and transcurrent fault system (Arima-Takatsuki Tectonic Line) forming the margins of the Kinki Triangle. The subsurface configurations of the <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> are interpreted in correlation with geomorphological, geological and geophysical information. On the basis of these seismic interpretations, the tectonic regime in the Kinki region is discussed. The results of this study are summarized as follows; {{it is likely that the}} compressional axis has likely changed from NW-SE to E-W in 2. 7 Ma to 0. 6 Ma as inferred from the growth structure by movement of <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> in the Kinki region. A time lag of this axis change is identified; starting in the northeast and shifting to the northwest of the region...|$|R

25|$|The Magallanes–Fagnano Fault, a dextral {{strike slip fault}} {{crosses the}} {{southern}} part of the main island from west to east. It is an <b>active</b> <b>fault,</b> located inside and parallel to the Fuegian fold and thrust belt, and marks the boundary between a southern belt of Paleozoic meta sediments and a northern Mesozoic belt of sedimentary sequences. Fagnano Lake occupies a glacier-carved depression in a pull-apart basin that has developed along the Magallanes-Fagnano Fault zone.|$|E
25|$|Though a {{pipeline}} from the North Slope {{to the nearest}} ice-free port, almost 800 miles (1,300km) to the south, {{was the only way}} to get Alaska's oil to market, significant engineering challenges lay ahead. Between the North Slope and Valdez, there were <b>active</b> <b>fault</b> lines, three mountain ranges, miles of unstable, boggy ground underlain with frost, and migration paths of caribou and moose. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was ultimately completed in 1977 at a total cost of $8 billion.|$|E
30|$|Identification and {{mapping of}} the <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> bear {{significant}} importance, {{because they provide}} the primary evidence of the style and kinematic of fault deformation. In this paper, studies on <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> are broadly divided into several sectors keeping in mind the variable strike of the Himalayan arc (Figs.  1, 2, 3).|$|R

25|$|Where {{the towers}} are founded on {{underwater}} piers, caissons are sunk and any soft bottom is excavated for a foundation. If the bedrock is too deep {{to be exposed}} by excavation or the sinking of a caisson, pilings are driven to the bedrock or into overlying hard soil, or a large concrete pad to distribute the weight over less resistant soil may be constructed, first preparing the surface with a bed of compacted gravel. (Such a pad footing can also accommodate the movements of an <b>active</b> <b>fault,</b> {{and this has been}} implemented on the foundations of the cable-stayed Rio-Antirio bridge.) The piers are then extended above water level, where they are capped with pedestal bases for the towers.|$|E
25|$|The Seattle Fault {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1965 but not documented as an <b>active</b> <b>fault</b> until 1992 {{with a set}} of five articles establishing that about 1100 years ago (AD 900—930) an earthquake of magnitude 7+ uplifted Restoration Point and Alki Point, dropped West Point (the three white triangles in the Seattle Basin on the map), caused rockslides in the Olympics, landslides into Lake Washington, and a tsunami on Puget Sound. It extends as far east as (and probably terminates at) the Rattlesnake Mountain Fault Zone (RMFZ; the southern extension of the SWIF) near Fall City. This seems geologically reasonable, as both the SWIF and RMFZ appear to be the contact between Tertiary Crescent Formation basement of Puget Sound on the west and the older Mesozoic (pre-Tertiary) mélange belt basement rocks under the Cascades on the east.|$|E
25|$|Transportation {{around the}} Los Angeles area was {{severely}} afflicted with roadway failures and the partial collapse of several major freeway interchanges. The near total {{failure of the}} Lower Van Norman Dam resulted in the evacuation {{of tens of thousands}} of downstream residents, though an earlier decision to maintain the water at a lower level may have contributed to saving the dam from being overtopped. Schools were affected, as they had been during the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, but this time amended construction styles improved the outcome for the thousands of school buildings in the Los Angeles area. Another aspect of the event were the hundreds of various types of landslides that were documented in the San Gabriel mountains. As had happened following other earthquakes in California, legislation related to building codes was once again revised, with laws that specifically addressed the construction of homes or businesses near known <b>active</b> <b>fault</b> zones.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the various {{definitions of the}} term “active fault” in geologic literature (in a broad sense). This reviewing activity, concentrated on the articles published {{in the past few}} decades and on the internet research, has generated the following remarks: i) the term is used to indicate faults which have been subject to movement in recent geologic time or which might move in the present or future; ii) the age limit given to <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> varies depending on the authors; iii) <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> are often associated with strong earthquakes. Identification of <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> can be based on direct and/or indirect methods (historical, geologic, geomorphologic, seismologic, geodetic, geochemical, geophysical and volcanic criteria). In conclusion, at present no universally accepted definition has been agreed upon for “active fault”, nor have the principles and criteria for the identification of <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> and their ranking been worked out...|$|R
500|$|Kīlauea ( [...] , also [...] ) is a {{currently}} active {{shield volcano}} in the Hawaiian Islands, {{and the most}} active of the five volcanoes that together form the island of Hawaii. Located along the southern shore of the island, the volcano is between 300,000 and 600,000 years old and emerged above sea level about 100,000 years ago. It is the second youngest product of the Hawaiian hotspot and the current eruptive center of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. Because it lacks topographic prominence and its activities historically coincided with those of Mauna Loa, Kīlauea was {{once thought to be}} a satellite of its much larger neighbor. Structurally, Kīlauea has a large, fairly recently formed caldera at its summit and two active rift zones, one extending [...] east and the other [...] west, as an <b>active</b> <b>fault</b> of unknown depth moving vertically an average of [...] per year.|$|E
500|$|A {{prominent}} {{structure on}} Kīlauea's southern flank is the Hilina fault system, a highly <b>active</b> <b>fault</b> moving vertically {{an average of}} [...] per year along the system. Its physiographic province is [...] deep, but it is unknown {{if it is a}} shallow listric fault or if it penetrates to the very base of the volcano. A number of cinder cones, satellite shields, lava tubes, and other eruptive structures also dot the volcano, evidence of its recent activity. Kīlauea has some interactions with Mauna Loa, its larger neighbor and only other recently active volcano on the island; interspersed lava flows and ash deposits belonging to its neighbor have been found on its flanks, and some of Mauna Loa's flows are, in turn, blanketed in Kīlauea tephra. In particular, the saddle between the two volcanoes is currently depressed, and is likely to fill over in the future.|$|E

40|$|Engineering risk is {{referred}} to as occurrence probability multiplied with the consequence when the event occurs. Few engineering decisions are now risk-based, using an alternative with the lowest risk as the solution to a problem. Under such a risk framework, this study develops a classification system for <b>active</b> <b>faults.</b> In addition to population at risk, this classification also considers the earthquake magnitudes and earthquake energy release. Applying such a classification to six <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> in Taiwan, we suggested that the Sanchiao Fault and Changhua Fault should be Category III <b>active</b> <b>faults,</b> the highest level in this classification system. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R

2500|$|A Mr. Okamura of the <b>Active</b> <b>Fault</b> and Earthquake Research Center ( [...] by , , AIST) urged TEPCO and NISA {{to review}} their {{assumption}} of possible tsunami heights {{based on a}} ninth century earthquake, {{but it was not}} seriously considered at that time. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission warned of a risk of losing emergency power in 1991 (NUREG-1150) and NISA referred to the report in 2004. No action to mitigate the risk was taken.|$|E
2500|$|Heavy damping {{mechanism}} {{incorporated in}} vibration control technologies and, particularly, in base isolation devices, is often considered a valuable source of suppressing vibrations thus enhancing a building's seismic performance. However, for the rather pliant {{systems such as}} base isolated structures, with a relatively low bearing stiffness but with a high damping, the so-called [...] "damping force" [...] may turn out the main pushing force at a strong earthquake. [...] The video shows a Lead Rubber Bearing being tested at the UCSD Caltrans-SRMD facility. The bearing is made of rubber with a lead core. It was a uniaxial test in which the bearing was also under a full structure load. Many buildings and bridges, both in New Zealand and elsewhere, are protected with lead dampers and lead and rubber bearings. Te Papa Tongarewa, the national museum of New Zealand, and the New Zealand Parliament Buildings have been fitted with the bearings. Both are in Wellington which sits on an <b>active</b> <b>fault.</b>|$|E

I emphasize that I make no pretext of speaking for either the geotechnical or structural engineers. You already know, of course, the answer posed by the title. It's both "yes" and "no". And I would like to focus on the question of: In what scientific areas, in particular, are our approaches changing, and in what areas do the traditional methods remain credible...|$|R
