Kinetic and equilibrium studies conducted in <b>actual</b> <b>water</b> revealed that the mineralization of water greatly elevated the As(V) adsorption on FVA.

40|$|While having {{basic access}} to water {{resources}} is clearly critical for survival, {{the extent to which}} water consumption contributes to wellbeing once basic needs have been met is not clear. In this study the link between household water consumption and wellbeing is assessed via a household survey conducted in southern England and <b>actual</b> <b>water</b> consumption data for the same households received from their water supply company. While the study revealed a few correlations, in general no link was found between <b>actual</b> <b>water</b> use and wellbeing. This suggests that high wellbeing is attainable regardless of low water use (assuming basic needs are met). In fact, when assessed through individual rather than composite measures of wellbeing, a weak but statistically significant link was shown between higher water use and some indicators of low wellbeing. Our results also show that <b>actual</b> <b>water</b> use appears to be unlinked to environmental attitudes, attitudes to water use or willingness to adopt water saving measures.

Results show that significant relations exist between perceived <b>water</b> consumption and <b>actual</b> <b>water</b> consumption.

The soil of the plots was sampled six times in vertical transects to a depth of 33 cm between 23 May and 7 October 2002. On each sampling date the soil water contents were measured and the persistence of <b>actual</b> <b>water</b> repellency was determined of field-moist samples. Considerably higher soil water contents were found in the bare versus the grass-covered plots. These alterations are caused by differences between evaporation and transpiration rates across the plots. Noteworthy are the often excessive differences in soil water content at depths of 10 to 30 cm between the bare and grass-covered plots. These differences are a consequence of water uptake by the roots in the grass-covered plots. The water storage in the upper 19 cm of the bare soil was at least two times greater than in the grass-covered soil during dry periods. A major part of the soil profile in the grass-covered plots exhibited extreme water repellency to a depth of 19 cm on all sampling dates, while the soil profile of the bare plots was completely wettable on eight of the twelve sampling dates. Significant differences in persistence of <b>actual</b> <b>water</b> repellency were found between the grass-covered and bare plots...|$|R

40|$|Assessments {{of water}} {{repellency}} of soils are commonly made on air-dried or oven-dried samples, without considering the soil water content. The objectives {{of this study}} were to examine the spatial and temporal variability of soil <b>water</b> content, <b>actual</b> <b>water</b> repellency over short distances, and the variations in critical soil water contents. Between 22 April and 23 November 1999, numerous samples were collected from a grass-covered dune sand (typic Psammaquent), at six depths, eight times in transects and two times in soil blocks. The water drop penetration time (WDPT) test was used to measure the <b>actual</b> <b>water</b> repellency of the field-moist samples and the potential water repellency after drying the samples at 25, 65, and 105 °C. Highly spatial and temporal variability in water content and persistence of <b>actual</b> <b>water</b> repellency was found between the samples from all soil depths. At each depth we established an upper water content, below which samples were water repellent and a lower water content, above which samples were wettable. This water content range, called the transition zone, was different for each depth, and, for example, assessed at 0 to 2. 5 cm depth between soil water contents of 18 and 23 % (vol. /vol.), and at 16. 5 to 19 cm depth between 2 and 5 % (vol. /vol.). The potential water repellency of samples dried at 25 and 65 °C was on some days less severe than the actual repellency of field-moist samples on other days, thus underestimating the maximal persistence of water repellency that can occur in the field. Drying of the samples at 105 °C significantly increased the potential water repellency...|$|R

The study proposes suggestions for improvements in meeting and balancing the water demands. Irrigation issues and the interviews with farmers and officials were used for the analysis.

Two lines of improvement are outlined. One is adjustment of the volumes allocated to each D. The second possibility of improvement points to greater involvement of farmers at the scheme and branch levels. A way to tackle this is to devise a transparent process of allocation at the scheme level whereby representatives from the different branch canals would participate in the definition of sharing arrangements. MASL’s role would be to ensure bulk allocation at the head of canal. FOs are responsible for finding ways to distribute this volume within their area...|$|R

A new model was developed for evaluation of higher heating value of dry pyrolysis oil. The dry oil has higher heating values in the range between 19 and 26 MJ/kg.
