5|$|In 1852, {{the pioneer}} town of Mount Carroll, Illinois, lacking a public school, {{incorporated}} the Mount Carroll Seminary with no land, no teachers <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>money.</b> The town persuaded Frances Wood and Cindarella Gregory, two schoolteachers from Ballston Spa, New York, {{to come and}} teach. On May 11, 1853, the new seminary opened in a local church with eleven students.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{balked at}} the plan, seeing in it {{an end to the}} United States policy of {{isolationism}} and the beginning of imperialism. Even some supporters of naval expansion were wary; Senator Eugene Hale feared that because the proposal was so large, the entire bill would be shot down <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> appropriated for any ships. However, in April 1890, the United States House of Representatives approved funding for three 8,000-long ton battleships. Tracy, trying to soothe tensions within Congress, remarked that these ships were so powerful that only twelve would be necessary instead of the 35 called for in the original plan. He also slashed the operating costs of the Navy by giving the remaining Civil War-era monitors—which were utterly obsolete by this time—to navy militias operated by the states. The appropriation was also approved by the Senate, and in total three coast-defense battleships (the Indiana class), a cruiser, and a torpedo boat were given official approval and funding on 30 June 1890.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} plot to {{discredit}} both Dart {{and the government of}} Texas, Edwards persuaded some abolitionists in Cincinnati to give him money with which he would supposedly liberate the slaves on his plantation in Texas, which he no longer owned. Edwards also tried to get money from the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in New York, but its leader, Lewis Tappan, did not trust him <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> was forthcoming from that source. Edwards then went to England, bearing forged letters of introduction from, among others, Daniel Webster and the American Secretary of State, John Forsyth. One of these letters was to Lord Spencer, who was so impressed he gave Edwards £250 as a loan. While in England, Edwards defrauded a company in Liverpool of about $20,000, and then used part of the funds to repay Lord Spencer. The Republic of Texas ambassador in London warned the English government against Edwards. Tappan also sent warnings, so Edwards was unable to acquire more money in England and had returned to the United States by June 1841.|$|E

5|$|The single-player {{adventure}} {{begins by}} personalizing a player character. Each character has randomly generated values for their statistical character attributes: charisma, constitution, dexterity, intelligence, strength, and wisdom. While the algorithm stays the same, the player can randomize repeatedly for new character attribute distributions until satisfied. The player {{begins with a}} sword, armor, shield, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>money,</b> and can only see his immediate surroundings, rather than the whole level. Monsters spawn randomly, and players have three options in battle: fight, use magic, or evade. Magic includes combative missiles, fireballs, lightning bolts, and turning the undead, as well as health regeneration and trap navigation. The effects of the game's most complex spells are not outlined in the instruction manual and must be learned by trial and error. Like the game, the battle events are carried out in real time instead of in turns. Enemies increase in difficulty as the player progresses through the dungeon. They include both living and undead monsters such as elves, dragons, mummies, and wraiths. Defeating enemies awards experience points, which accrete to raise the player's experience level and increase player stats. The player is rewarded with treasures that include magical weapons, armor items, and potions. Players can code their own features into the game.|$|E

His total of 52,533 votes exceeded the threshold of votes set by New York law (50,000) and hence guaranteed the Green Party of New York an automatic ballot line {{for the next four}} years (see election results, New York governor). He said that, with no political machine <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> backing him, the likelihood of winning the governorship would be like climbing Mount Everest barefooted.|$|E

25|$|Scholars {{differ on}} whether the tours made {{substantial}} profits. To be sure, often the children performed before large audiences and took in large sums, but the expenses of travel were also very high, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> at all was made during the various times that Leopold and the children suffered serious illnesses. Mozart biographer Maynard Solomon (1995) takes {{the view that the}} tours were lucrative and produced long-term profits for Leopold; Ruth Halliwell (1998) states to the contrary that their income generally only covered their travel and living expenses.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} {{had been}} unforeseen, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> could be appropriated for the expense. With the state's credit in ruins, {{the prospect of}} borrowing money for such purposes from out-of-state lenders was unlikely. With the legislature out of session and the state's coffers empty, Whitcomb had no funds for the enterprise. On May 26, Whitcomb took a personal loan, on his own credit, for $10,000 from the Bank of Indiana's Madison branch, which he used to purchase arms for the state's regiments. The same day he sent letters to other branches of the bank requesting equivalent loans from them, which allowed the state to muster the five regiments that had been requested by the Federal Government. Once the General Assembly convened, they repaid what he had paid from his own pocket and assumed his outstanding debts to the bank. For {{his role as a}} war-time governor, a bronze statue of Whitcomb was placed in Monument Circle in Indianapolis.|$|E
25|$|The Carthaginian {{leadership}} {{probably thought}} Rome had been defeated and invested little manpower in Sicily. With a small force <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> to hire new troops, Hamilcar’s strategic goal probably was {{to maintain a}} stalemate, as he had neither the resources {{to win the war}} nor the authority to peacefully settle it Hamilcar was in command of a mercenary army composed of multiple nationalities and his ability to successfully lead this force demonstrates his skill as field commander. He employed combined arms tactics, like Alexander and Pyrrhus, and his strategy was similar to the one employed by Quintus Fabius Maximus in the Second Punic War, ironically against Hannibal, the eldest son of Hamilcar Barca, in Italy during 217 BC. The difference was that Fabius commanded a numerically superior army to his opponent, had no supply problems, and had room to manoeuvre, while Hamilcar was mostly static, had a far smaller army than the Romans and was dependent on seaborne supplies from Carthage.|$|E

25|$|With few {{commissions}} for painting, Hazlitt {{seized the}} opportunity to ready for publication his philosophical treatise, which, according to his son, he had completed by 1803. Godwin intervened to help him find a publisher, and the work, An Essay on the Principles of Human Action: Being an Argument in favour of the Natural Disinterestedness of the Human Mind, was printed in a limited edition of 250 copies by Joseph Johnson on 19 July 1805. This gained him little notice as an original thinker, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>money.</b> Although the treatise he valued above anything else he wrote was never, at least in his own lifetime, recognised for what he believed was its true worth, it brought him attention as one who had a grasp of contemporary philosophy. He therefore was commissioned to abridge and write a preface to a now obscure work of mental philosophy, The Light of Nature Pursued by Abraham Tucker (originally published in seven volumes from 1765 to 1777), which appeared in 1807 and may have had some influence on his own later thinking.|$|E

[...] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that [...] "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant.

Marvel Studios also explored opportunities to integrate other characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe into future Spider-Man films financed, distributed, and controlled by Sony Pictures, with Robert Downey, Jr. the first confirmed to reprise his role as Tony Stark / Iron Man in Spider-Man: Homecoming. In June 2015, Feige clarified that the initial Sony deal does not apply to the MCU television series, as it was [...] "very specific ... {{with a certain amount of}} back and forth allowed." [...] Both studios have the ability to terminate the agreement at any point, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> was exchanged with the deal.

500|$|After {{the defeat}} in Tacuarí, the {{government}} of Buenos Aires (which by then was the First Triumvirate) issued a series of conflicting orders. First they requested he should fight the royalists in the Banda Oriental, then {{to return to the}} city and be judged for the defeats. However, no charges were formulated against him. He was appointed {{as the head of the}} Regiment of Patricians, replacing the banished Cornelio Saavedra, but the troops did not accept him and started the Braids Mutiny. After that, the Triumvirate requested that he fortify Rosario against possible royalist attacks from the Banda Oriental. Belgrano created two batteries, [...] "Independencia" [...] ("Independence") and [...] "Libertad" [...] ("Freedom"). After realising that both patriots and royalists were fighting under the same colours, he created the cockade of Argentina, of light blue and white, the use of which was approved by the Triumvirate. The reasons for the colours are usually considered to be either loyalty to the House of Bourbon or his esteem of the Virgin Mary. Belgrano created a flag with the same colours, which was hoisted at Rosario near the Paraná River on 27 February 1812. On that same day he was appointed to replace Pueyrredon in the Army of the North, so he travelled to Yatasto. He found demoralised officials, nearly 1,500 soldiers (a quarter of them hospitalised), minimal artillery, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>money.</b> Some of the officials were Manuel Dorrego, Gregorio Aráoz de Lamadrid, Cornelio Zelaya, José María Paz, Diego Balcarce, and Eustaquio Díaz Vélez. The cities were much more hostile to the Army than those that Belgrano encountered on his way into Paraguay. Salta was menaced by the royalist general José Manuel de Goyeneche; Belgrano had orders to take command and retreat without fighting, but he disobeyed. He prepared a base at Campo Santo, in Salta, where he improved the hospital and created a military tribunal. He later moved to Jujuy, knowing that he did not have the resources to launch an attack on Upper Perú.|$|E
