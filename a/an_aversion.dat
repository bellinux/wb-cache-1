5|$|Like their garage rock predecessors, {{these local}} scenes were {{facilitated}} by enthusiastic impresarios who operated nightclubs or organized concerts in venues such as schools, garages, or warehouses, advertised via inexpensively printed flyers and fanzines. In some cases, punk's {{do it yourself}} ethic reflected <b>an</b> <b>aversion</b> to commercial success, {{as well as a}} desire to maintain creative and financial autonomy. As Joe Harvard, a participant in the Boston scene, describes, it was often a simple necessity—the absence of a local recording industry and well-distributed music magazines left little recourse but DIY.|$|E
5|$|People {{with cancer}} may not report pain due to costs of {{treatment}}, {{a belief that}} pain is inevitable, <b>an</b> <b>aversion</b> to treatment side effects, fear of developing addiction or tolerance, fear of distracting the doctor from treating the illness, or fear of masking a symptom that is important for monitoring progress of the illness. People {{may be reluctant to}} take adequate pain medicine because they are unaware of their prognosis, or may be unwilling to accept their diagnosis. Failure to report pain or misguided reluctance to take pain medicine can be overcome by sensitive coaching.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{prepares for}} an acting {{job in a}} {{laboratory}} safety video that was arranged by his talent agent, Carla Fern (Roseanne Barr). The directors continuously have {{to talk him out}} of overacting, and he backs down from shooting a scene using an eye wash, since he has <b>an</b> <b>aversion</b> towards anything being shot into his eye. However, Carla threatens to have him blacklisted if he does not go through with the scene. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who came along as friendly support, gives Andy the confidence to shoot the scene, and in the end Andy even insists on doing two takes.|$|E
5|$|The {{second child}} of Johnstone Melmore and Jessie Francis Leech, Leech {{was born in}} Bendigo in Australia. She was given the name Faith after her elder sister, who died from leukaemia {{at the age of}} two. A {{delicate}} child, Leech had <b>an</b> <b>aversion</b> to eating {{in the first two years}} of her life, so her mother fed her in small hourly doses. Leech was twice rushed from the family home to a Melbourne hospital. Conventional medicine failed to rectify Leech's dietary issues, so her mother put her on a fast for ten days at the recommendation of a naturopath. Leech was later placed on a diet of fruit, salad and vegetables, with an emphasis on beetroot juice and carrot juice.|$|E
5|$|Monica (Courteney Cox) {{tells her}} friends {{that she will}} not be cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving because of the large amount of {{leftovers}} it will create. Chandler does not eat turkey {{as a result of his}} dislike of all Thanksgiving foods (a result of childhood trauma), Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow's character) is a vegetarian and Rachel was having <b>an</b> <b>aversion</b> to poultry from her pregnancy. This left only Monica, Ross and Joey to eat the enormous turkey. Joey (Matt LeBlanc) protests, and announces that he will eat the entire turkey himself if necessary. Monica agrees, and Joey finishes the nineteen-pound turkey by the end of the episode. Monica tells Rachel that she has invited over an old high-school friend of hers and Ross's called Will Colbert (Brad Pitt). Rachel does not remember him, and he reacts with total disgust when he finds out Rachel will be joining them for dinner.|$|E

5|$|The web series {{begins as}} Jake Fischer arrives in Bright Falls to {{interview}} Dr. Hartman {{on his new}} book, an assignment from his publication agency. After a series of encounters with local townspeople, Jake soon finds himself the victim of long periods of lost time and black outs. He finds himself {{waking up in the}} middle of a forest and other locations where he had not been previously. He also develops <b>an</b> <b>aversion</b> towards lights and daytime. The longer he stays in Bright Falls, the more violent his behaviour becomes. When he realises this, he tries to duct-tape himself to a refrigerator and recording videotape himself in his sleep to see what might be causing the behaviour. It is implied that he is being completely taken over by the Dark Presence, to the point of murdering several people. He then vanishes, just before the arrival of Alan and Alice Wake.|$|E
5|$|The chicks {{take from}} 34 to 50 days to fledge, the period {{depending}} on the abundance of their food supply. In years of fish shortage, the whole colony may experience a longer fledgling period but the normal range is 38 to 44 days, by which time chicks will have reached about 75% of their mature body weight. The chick may come to the burrow entrance to defecate but does not usually emerge into the open and seems to have <b>an</b> <b>aversion</b> to light until it is nearly fully fledged. Although the supply of fish by the adults reduces {{over the last few}} days spent in the nest, the chick is not abandoned as happens in the Manx shearwater. On occasions, an adult has been observed provisioning a nest even after the chick has departed. During the last few days underground, the chick sheds its down and the juvenile plumage is revealed. Its relatively small beak and its legs and feet are a dark colour and it lacks the white facial patches of the adult. The chick finally leaves its nest at night, when the risk of predation is at its lowest. When the moment arrives, it emerges from the burrow, usually for the first time, and walks, runs and flaps its way to the sea. It cannot fly properly yet so descending a cliff is perilous; when it reaches the water it paddles out to sea, and may be three kilometres (two miles) away from the shore by daybreak. It does not congregate with others of its kind and will not return to land for two or three years.|$|E

50|$|An {{anxious state}} {{at the time of}} {{learning}} can create <b>a</b> stronger <b>aversion</b> to the stimuli. <b>A</b> stronger <b>aversion</b> can lead to stronger associations in memory between the stimulus and response, therefore enhancing the memory of the response to the stimulus. When extinction is attempted in male and female humans, compared to a neutral control without anxiety, extinction does not occur. This suggests that memory is enhanced for learning, specifically fear learning, when anxiety is present.|$|R

25|$|The {{language}} of the Amidah most likely comes from the mishnaic period, {{both before and after}} the destruction of the Temple (70 CE) as the probable time of its composition and compilation. In the time of the Mishnah, it was considered unnecessary to prescribe its text and content. This may have been simply because the language was well known to the Mishnah's authors. The Mishnah may also not have recorded a specific text because of <b>an</b> <b>aversion</b> to making prayer a matter of rigor and fixed formula, <b>an</b> <b>aversion</b> that continued at least to some extent throughout the Talmudic period, as evidenced by the opinions of R. Eliezer (Talmud Ber. 29b) and R. Simeon ben Yohai (Ab. ii. 13). R. Jose held that one should include something new in one's prayer every day (Talmud Yerushalmi Ber. 8b), a principle said to have been carried into practice by R. Eleazar and R. Abbahu (ib.). Prayer was not to be read as one would read a letter (ib.).|$|E
