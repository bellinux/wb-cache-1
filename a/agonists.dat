5|$|An inverse agonist {{can have}} effects {{similar to those}} of an antagonist, but causes a {{distinct}} set of downstream biological responses. Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity can have inverse <b>agonists,</b> which not only block the effects of binding <b>agonists</b> like a classical antagonist but also inhibit the basal activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are now beginning to be reclassified as inverse <b>agonists</b> because of the discovery of constitutive active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been reclassified as inverse <b>agonists.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though {{dopamine}} <b>agonists</b> {{are less}} effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms, {{they are usually}} effective enough to manage these symptoms {{in the first years}} of treatment. Dyskinesias due to dopamine <b>agonists</b> are rare in younger people who have PD but, along with other complications, become more common with older age at onset. Thus dopamine <b>agonists</b> are the preferred initial treatment for younger onset PD, and levodopa is preferred for older onset PD.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine <b>agonists</b> produce significant, {{although}} usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. <b>Agonists</b> have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.|$|E

50|$|An <b>agonist</b> is a {{chemical}} that binds to a receptor and activates the receptor {{to produce a}} biological response. Whereas an <b>agonist</b> causes an action, an antagonist blocks {{the action of the}} <b>agonist</b> and an inverse <b>agonist</b> causes an action opposite to that of the <b>agonist.</b>|$|R

5|$|Many antagonists are {{reversible}} antagonists that, {{like most}} <b>agonists,</b> will bind and unbind a receptor at rates determined by receptor-ligand kinetics.|$|E
5|$|Other {{topics of}} {{research}} have included investigations into mannitol, dexamethasone, progesterone, xenon, barbiturates, magnesium, calcium channel blockers, PPAR-γ <b>agonists,</b> curcuminoids, ethanol, NMDA antagonists, caffeine.|$|E
5|$|Partial <b>agonists</b> {{are defined}} as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the {{amplitude}} of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are <b>agonists,</b> partial <b>agonists</b> {{can act as a}} competitive antagonist {{in the presence of a}} full agonist, as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone. Clinically, their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full <b>agonists</b> or antagonists. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence.|$|E
50|$|An {{irreversible}} <b>agonist</b> {{is a type}} of <b>agonist</b> {{that binds}} permanently to a receptor in such a manner that the receptor is permanently activated. It is distinct from a mere (reversible) <b>agonist</b> in that the association of an <b>agonist</b> to a receptor is reversible, whereas the binding of an irreversible <b>agonist</b> to a receptor is, at least in theory, irreversible. Oxymorphazone is an example of an irreversible <b>agonist.</b> In practice, the distinction may be more a matter of degree, in which the binding affinity of an irreversible <b>agonist</b> is some orders of magnitude greater than that of an <b>agonist.</b>|$|R

5|$|Selective {{glucocorticoid}} receptor modulators (SEGRMs) {{and selective}} glucocorticoid receptor <b>agonists</b> (SEGRAs) {{formerly known as}} dissociated glucocorticoid receptor <b>agonists</b> (DIGRAs) are a class of experimental drugs designed to share many of the desirable anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, or anticancer properties of classical glucocorticoid drugs but with fewer side effects such as skin atrophy. Although preclinical evidence on SEGRAMs’ anti-inflammatory effects are culminating, currently, the efficacy of these SEGRAMs on cancer are largely unknown.|$|E
5|$|Several {{dopamine}} <b>agonists</b> {{that bind}} to dopamine receptors {{in the brain}} have similar effects to levodopa. These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications. Dopamine <b>agonists</b> include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine and lisuride.|$|E
5|$|Both non-selective {{glucocorticoids}} {{and selective}} glucocorticoid receptor <b>agonists</b> work by binding to and activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In contrast to glucocorticoids, which activate the GR {{to work through}} (at least) two signal transduction pathways, SEGRAMs activate the GR {{in such a way}} that it only operates through one of the two main possible pathways.|$|E

A similar amplitude of <b>agonist</b> induced Ca mobilization between single cell and populational approaches was observed. New findings in single cells not observable in populations of cells include: 1) {{the maintenance of}} a sustained elevation in [Ca 2 +]i above basal levels throughout <b>agonist</b> application, 2) the reloading of the agonist-sensitive Ca pool only following removal of the <b>agonist</b> and 3) the presence of oscillations of [Ca 2 +]i in response to <b>agonist</b> application which is enhanced at lower <b>agonist</b> concentrations...|$|R
5|$|By definition, antagonists display no {{efficacy}} {{to activate}} the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit the function of <b>agonists,</b> inverse <b>agonists,</b> and partial <b>agonists.</b> In functional antagonist assays, a dose-response curve measures {{the effect of the}} ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. The potency of an antagonist is usually defined by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the potency of the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response. Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side-effects.|$|E
5|$|Impulse control {{disorders}} including pathological gambling, compulsive sexual behavior, binge eating, compulsive {{shopping and}} reckless generosity {{can be caused}} by medication, particularly orally active dopamine <b>agonists.</b> The dopamine dysregulation syndrome – with wanting of medication leading to overusage – is a rare complication of levodopa use (Giovannoni, et al. 2000).|$|E
5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} can {{be placed}} into one of three groups by its elimination half-life, or {{time it takes for}} the body to eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites, such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are partial <b>agonists.</b>|$|E
50|$|Potency is {{the amount}} of <b>agonist</b> needed to elicit a desired response. The potency of an <b>agonist</b> is {{inversely}} related to its EC50 value. The EC50 can be measured for a given <b>agonist</b> by determining the concentration of <b>agonist</b> needed to elicit half of the maximum biological response of the <b>agonist.</b> The EC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies producing physiologically similar effects. The smaller the EC50 value, the greater the potency of the <b>agonist,</b> the lower the concentration of drug that is required to elicit the maximum biological response.|$|R
40|$|Cultured {{human lung}} {{fibroblasts}} were evaluated for their responsiveness to isoprenaline (isoproterenol) or prostaglandin E 2 {{before and after}} chronic incubation with the <b>agonist.</b> Cells incubated for 6 h with either <b>agonist</b> were suppressed in terms of collagen production and exhibited increased intracellular cyclic AMP. Cells incubated for 72 h with the <b>agonist</b> and then re-challenged for 6 h with the same <b>agonist</b> did not demonstrate suppressed collagen production or increased cyclic AMP. Cells incubated for 72 h with isoprenaline still responded to prostaglandin E 2 when challenged for 6 h; however, when the order of <b>agonist</b> exposure was reversed, cells incubated with prostaglandin E 2 {{did not respond to}} a challenge by isoprenaline. If cells were allowed to recover for 48 h without the <b>agonist</b> after a 72 h chronic incubation, they recovered their responsiveness to the <b>agonist.</b> The results indicate that, although cultured fibroblasts may become desensitized to one <b>agonist,</b> they may retain their sensitivity to a second <b>agonist</b> and chronic suppression of collagen production may be achieved by alternate exposure to isoprenaline and prostaglandin E 2...|$|R

5|$|Apomorphine, a non-orally {{administered}} dopamine agonist, {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous subcutaneous infusions. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored. Two dopamine <b>agonists</b> that are administered through skin patches (lisuride and rotigotine) and are useful for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state.|$|E
5|$|Efforts are {{underway}} {{to determine how}} the extra chromosome 21 material causes Down syndrome, as currently this is unknown, and to develop treatments to improve intelligence in those with the syndrome. One hope is to use stem cells. Other methods being studied include the use of antioxidants, gamma secretase inhibition, adrenergic <b>agonists,</b> and memantine. Research is often carried out on an animal model, the Ts65Dn mouse.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his ARIA work, Fischbach also researched rapid desensitization of glutamate receptors in chicken spinal cord and rat hippocampal neurons. Using focal ionophoresis and pressure injections to apply glutamate and other <b>agonists</b> including NMDA, AMPA, and kainate to {{different regions of the}} neurons, he noticed that certain hot spots were desensitized more rapidly that other sites on the neuron. Fischbach and his collaborators hypothesized that these hot spots may be located at synapses between neurons, where clusters of glutamate receptors were present.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be altered {{by a variety of}} modulators. For example, the steroid hormone estradiol may enhance LTP by driving CREB phosphorylation and subsequent dendritic spine growth. Additionally, β-adrenergic receptor <b>agonists</b> such as norepinephrine may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP. Nitric oxide synthase activity may also result in the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG. Similarly, activation of dopamine receptors may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.|$|E
5|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases like}} atopic dermatitis (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),…, {{the side effects}} of corticosteroids are problematic because of the necessary long-term treatment. Therefore, SEGRAMs are being investigated as an alternative topical treatment. Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal. It {{remains to be seen whether}} selective receptor <b>agonists</b> or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.|$|E
5|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} are largely determined by {{activity in the}} area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a region known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors. Consequently, drugs that activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause nausea. This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson's disease, {{as well as other}} dopamine <b>agonists</b> such as apomorphine. In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti-nausea drugs.|$|E
