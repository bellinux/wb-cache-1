The First World War reduced the volume of trade enormously, and after the cessation of hostilities, the trade at St David's never recovered, as shippers preferred to use nearby harbours which were better suited to handling larger vessels. That process accelerated to 1945, when the now-obsolete coal handling equipment at St David's was an insuperable limitation. During World War II the Admiralty was the only customer, {{it was agreed that}} the coal output would all be taken north to the Alice Pit (a little to the east of the George Pit, and adjacent to the former ED line) and taken away by main line railway.|$|E

2500|$|The 1984 {{production}} of The Pope's Wedding {{had been seen}} by director Alex Cox, who offered Oldman the part of ill-fated rocker Sid Vicious in the 1986 film Sid and Nancy. He twice turned down the role before accepting it, because, in his own words: [...] "I wasn't really that interested in Sid Vicious and the punk movement. I'd never followed it. It wasn't something that interested me. The script I felt was banal and 'who cares' and 'why bother' <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> And I {{was a little bit}} sort-of with my nose in the air and sort-of thinking 'well the theatre – so much more superior' and all of that." [...] He reconsidered based on the salary and the urging of his agent. In 1987, Oldman gained his third starring film role as Joe Orton in Prick Up Your Ears, for which he received a BAFTA nomination for Best Actor. That same year, he appeared in the plays The Country Wife (William Wycherley) and Serious Money (Caryl Churchill). Director Luc Besson told how, on the set of The Fifth Element (1997), Oldman could recite any scene from Hamlet (William Shakespeare), in which he had starred a decade earlier.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2015, Jonathan Levine, Ted Melfi, Jason Moore, {{the writing}} team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, and Jared Hess were being {{considered}} {{to direct the}} film. Butterfield, Holland, Judah Lewis, Matthew Lintz, Charlie Plummer, and Charlie Rowe screen tested for the lead role against Robert Downey Jr., who portrays Tony Stark / Iron Man in the MCU, for [...] "chemistry". The six were chosen out of a search of over 1,500 actors to test in front of Feige, Pascal, and the Russo brothers, the directors of Captain America: Civil War. By early June 2015, Levine and Melfi had become the favorites to direct the film, with Daley and Goldstein, and Jon Watts also in consideration, while Feige and Pascal narrowed the actors considered to Holland and Rowe, with both screen testing with Downey again. Holland also tested with Chris Evans, who portrays Steve Rogers / Captain America in the MCU, and emerged as the favorite. On June 23, Marvel and Sony officially announced that Holland would star as Spider-Man, and that Watts would direct the film. The Russos [...] "were pretty vocal about who [...] wanted for the part", pushing to cast an actor close {{to the age of}} Peter Parker in order to differentiate from the previous portrayals. They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background. Watts was able to read the Civil War script, talk with the Russos, and was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes in that film. He was able to [...] "see what they were doing with it" [...] and provide [...] "ideas about this and that", including what Parker's bedroom and wardrobe looked like [...] "so that my movie transitions seamlessly with theirs." [...] On joining the MCU and directing the film, Watts said, [...] "I was really excited about that, because the other movies have shown what I described as the Penthouse level of the Marvel world, what it’s like to be Thor, Iron Man, you know, a billionaire playboy <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> stuff. But what’s great about Spider-Man is that he’s a regular kid and so by showing his story you also get to show what the ground level is like in a world where the Avengers exist".|$|E

60|$|The solitaries of the Thebaid {{found that}} they became selfish wild beasts, or went mad, if they {{remained}} alone; and they formed themselves into lauras, 'lanes' of huts, convents, under a common abbot or father. The evangelical converts {{of the last century}} formed themselves into powerful and highly organized sects. The middle-age monasteries organized themselves into highly artificial communities round some sacred spot, generally under the supposed protection of some saint or martyr, whose bones lay there. Each method was good, though not the highest. None of them rises {{to the idea of a}} people, having one national life, under one monarch, the representative to each <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> national life, and the dispenser and executor of its laws. Indeed, the artificial organization, whether monastic or sectarian, may become so strong as to interfere with national life, and make men forget their real duty to their king and country, in their self-imposed duty to the sect or order to which they belong. The monastic organization indeed had to die, in many countries, in order that national life might develop itself; and the dissolution of the monasteries marks the birth of an united and powerful England. They or Britain must have died. An imperium in imperio--much more many separate imperia--was an element of national weakness, which might be allowed in times of peace and safety, but not in times of convulsion and of danger.|$|E
60|$|For instance, on a {{fine day}} early in April, {{as we were}} {{crossing}} over to superintend the building of our house, we were startled by a striped snake, with his little bright eyes, raising himself to look at us, and putting out his red, forked tongue. Now {{there is no more}} harm in these little garden-snakes than there is in a robin or a squirrel--they are poor little, peaceable, timid creatures, which could not do any harm if they would; but the prejudices of society are so strong against them that one does not like to cultivate too much intimacy with them. So we tried to turn out of our path into a tangle of bushes; and there, instead of one, we found four snakes. We turned on the other side, and there were two more. In short, everywhere we looked, the dry leaves were rustling and coiling with them; and we were in despair. In vain we said that they were harmless as kittens, and tried to persuade ourselves that their little bright eyes were pretty, and that their serpentine movements were in the exact line of beauty: for the life of us, we could not help remembering their family name and connections; we thought of those disagreeable gentlemen the anacondas, the rattlesnakes, and the copper-heads, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> bad line, immediate family friends of the old serpent to whom we are indebted for all the mischief that is done in this world.
