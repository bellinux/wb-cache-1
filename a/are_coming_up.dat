25|$|There {{are many}} simple {{methods such as}} priming, prompt delivery, picture schedules, peer tutoring, and {{cooperative}} learning, that have been proven to help autistic students to prepare for class and to understand the material better. Priming is done by allowing the students to see the assignment or material before they are shown in class. Prompt delivery consists of giving prompts to the autistic children in order to elicit {{a response to the}} academic material. Picture schedules are used to outline the progression of a class and are visual cues to allow autistic children to know when changes in the activity <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up.</b> This method has proven to be very useful in helping the students follow the activities. Peer tutoring and cooperative learning are ways in which an autistic student and a nonhandicapped student are paired together in the learning process. This has shown be very effective for “increasing both academic success and social interaction.” There are more specific strategies that have been shown to improve an autistic’s education, such as LEAP, Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children, and Non-Model-Specific Special Education Programs for preschoolers. LEAP is “an intensive 12-month program that focuses on providing a highly structured and safe environment that helps students to participate in and derive benefit from educational programming” and focuses on children from 5-21 who are on the have a more severe case of autism. The goal of the program is to develop functional independence through academic instruction, vocational/translational curriculum, speech/language services, and other services personalized for each student. While LEAP, TEACCH, and Non-Model Specific Special Education Programs are all different strategies, there has been no evidence that one is more effective than the other.|$|E

She'll survive this one and, hopefully, maybe this time she'll learn something from it." [...] She also described Jill as being in a [...] "soul-searching period" [...] during the storyline, saying: [...] "Now she's numbing herself with the alcohol because all those feelings of love <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> for her mother, and she doesn't {{know how to deal with}} them." [...] Walton said she felt Jill had been [...] "shaken to the very foundation" [...] upon the revelation that Katherine is her mother, stating: [...] "A big part of who she has been all these years has to do with her anger towards Katherine. She always shoved any feeling of love down. Now, she's questioning everything about herself. That's why she is in such pain and why she is drinking. That hate thing is baseless now." [...] While admitting to having been surprised with the maternity revelation, Walton thought it was [...] "fabulous and rich, and it's opened up a whole new facet to the story". However, in 2009, the characters' history was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell; Charlotte had made up this information for revenge against Katherine, and they were not mother and daughter.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, the {{residents}} <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> {{with plans to}} get into the castle and steal Excalibur, but Zelena already knew a way in, having studied the place, on the condition that her powers were restored. As Regina, Hook, David, and Robin sneak their way into the castle, Regina asked Mary Margaret to watch Zelena, with her cuff still on. At the same time, Arthur had other plans for {{the residents}}, as he showed Guinevere a potion that melts anything that it touches. It also turns out that Zelena had double crossed her fellow Storybrookers by tricking Mary Margaret with fake contractions, before knocking her out and tying her up.

(This spell introduced Dark Magic into Merlin's body.) Despite David's pleas, Arthur uses the sword to summon Merlin. As Merlin and Emma are returning to Camelot, Emma discovers that Merlin is missing, even as he appears in front of Arthur. Arthur forces Merlin to disarm the others, but Merlin informs him that Emma had passed her test, and that he had what he needed to unite Excalibur. However, Arthur refuses to give Merlin the sword, in hopes of obtaining more glory, before ordering Merlin to make the [...] "intruders" [...] disappear.|$|E
