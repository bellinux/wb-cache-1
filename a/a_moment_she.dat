He and the panther attack the trio, defeating them, and the floor falls out underneath them.|$|E
25|$|Boyer {{told the}} police that she had first met Cooke earlier that night and had spent the evening in his company. She claimed that after they left a local nightclub together, she had {{repeatedly}} requested that he take her home, but he instead took her against her will to the Hacienda Motel. She claimed that once {{in one of the}} motel's rooms, Cooke physically forced her onto the bed, and that she was certain he was going to rape her. According to Boyer, when Cooke stepped into the bathroom for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>she</b> quickly grabbed her clothes and ran from the room. She claimed that in her haste, she had also scooped up most of Cooke's clothing by mistake. She said she ran first to the manager's office and knocked on the door seeking help. However, she said that the manager took too long in responding, so, fearing Cooke would soon be coming after her, she fled from the motel before the manager ever opened the door. She said she then put her clothing back on, hid Cooke's clothing, went to a telephone booth, and called police.|$|E

After divorcing from Patricia, Carey's mother, when the singer was only three, he kept only limited contact with her throughout the years, as Patricia continuously moved due to their poverty. During this period of Carey's life, {{when she was just}} recovering from a breakdown and career slouch, she began reconnecting with her father during his short time in hospital care. In a song titled [...] "Sunflowers for Alfred Roy", present on Charmbracelet, Carey refers to <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> shared with him on his death-bed. Critics described the song as [...] "the album's most lyrically personal song" [...] and appreciated its simple piano accompaniment, while Carey retells of a visit she shared with her father in his hospital room, [...] "Strange to feel that proud, strong man / Grip tightly to my hand." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hyperion senses her {{attention}} and gazes back, and, although a non-physical entity, also begins to desire her company. Sliding through her window {{when she is}} asleep, he caresses Cătălina as she dreams of him. In one such <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>she</b> moans for him to [...] "glide down upon a ray" [...] and become her betrothed.

2500|$|Several years pass, and {{the scene}} shifts to St. Petersburg. [...] Onegin has come to attend the most {{prominent}} balls and interact {{with the leaders of}} old Russian society. He sees the most beautiful woman, who captures the attention of all and is central to society's whirl, and he realizes that it is the same Tatyana whose love he had once turned away. Now she is married to an aged prince (a general). Upon seeing Tatyana again, he becomes obsessed with winning her affection, {{despite the fact that she}} is married. However, his attempts are rebuffed. He writes her several letters, but receives no reply.

2500|$|.....the virgin {{knelt down}} with great veneration in an {{attitude}} of prayer, and her back was turned to the manger.... And while she was standing thus in prayer, I saw the child in her womb move and suddenly in <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> {{gave birth to her}} son, from whom radiated such an ineffable light and splendour, that the sun was not comparable to it, nor did the candle that St. Joseph had put there, give any light at all, the divine light totally annihilating the material light of the candle.... I saw the glorious infant lying on the ground naked and shining. His body was pure from any kind of soil and impurity. Then I heard also the singing of the angels, which was of miraculous sweetness and great beauty... After this the Virgin kneels to pray to her child, to be joined by Saint Joseph, and this (technically known as the [...] "Adoration of Christ" [...] or [...] "of the Child") becomes one of the commonest depictions in the 15th century, largely replacing the reclining Virgin in the West. Versions of this depiction occur as early as 1300, well before Bridget's vision, and have a Franciscan origin.|$|E
2500|$|As a black time traveller, the {{character}} of Martha allows Doctor Who to explore historical issues concerning race. In the episode [...] "The Shakespeare Code", Martha wonders if she is safe in an era before emancipation, but the Doctor is unconcerned. The Doctor points out to Martha (also the audience surrogate) that England in 1599 is [...] "not so different from your time"; black women are seen walking amongst the crowd at home and safe, and Martha identifies several cross-dressing actors. Martha soon reacts with surprise and possible offence to William Shakespeare's use of Elizabethan terms for black people such as [...] "" [...] and [...] "ethiop". For <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>she</b> thinks these terms could be racist (the Doctor quips that it is [...] "political correctness gone mad"), but realises Shakespeare is actually enamoured of her. At {{the end of the}} episode, he calls her his [...] "Dark Lady", the name given to the woman the real Shakespeare referred to in a number of Shakespeare's sonnets; by implication, Martha is the Dark Lady. Lindy A. Orthia opines that such Tenth Doctor era representations of [...] "Earth’s past as a place of happy and benign diversity" [...] may be anti-racist in intention, but ultimately trivialise the racism that she claims has [...] "infested" [...] Western society for centuries. Such representations include visions of [...] "Depression-era New York [...] mixed-race shanty towns led by a black man ("Daleks in Manhattan"), while black women populate the streets and royal courts of Victorian England and Enlightenment France".|$|E
