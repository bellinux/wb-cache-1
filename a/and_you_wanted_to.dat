However, there it is now, and lucky it is you have got it. However hard the times, however great the danger, a man will hardly starve in Scotland with fifty pounds in his pocket; so now we will turn our faces west, and make for the head of one of the lochs; there are plenty of fish to be had for catching, and with them and a little oatmeal and a bottle or two of whiskey we can live like lords." ...|$|E

50|$|The United States Department of Justice {{announced}} a $33 million settlement with Hudson City Savings Bank, which services New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, on September 24, 2015. The six year DOJ investigation had proven {{that the company}} was intentionally avoiding granting mortgages to Latinos and African Americans and purposefully avoided expanding into minority-majority communities. The Justice Department called it the “largest residential mortgage redlining settlement in its history.” As a part of the settlement agreemnt, HCSB was forced to open branches in non-white communities. As U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman explained to Emily Badger for The Washington Post, “if you lived in a majority-black or Hispanic neighborhood <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> apply for a mortgage, Hudson City Savings Bank was not the place to go.” The enforcement agencies cited additional evidence of discrimination Hudson City’s broker selection practices, noting that the bank received 80 percent of its mortgage applications from mortgage brokers but that the brokers with whom the bank worked were not located in majority African-American and Hispanic areas.|$|E

I always feel like asking the question ‘Well how the fuck wasn’t it?” Where’s the revolution man? What’s Rise Against’s revolution? What’s the revolution? Is there a revolution that, a bunch of people are gonna start coming out to their shows and make them really rich and a really big band? Because that’s been done a million fucken times before. Is the revolution that they’re gonna be poster boys for PETA while wearing Nike shoes? ‘Cause i don’t fucking buy into it man, I think PETA’s full of shit. I think a lot of their politics are kinda opportunistic and self serving personally.|$|E
