5|$|In general, {{like with}} many of the New Trade Theory models, the results of the Brander Spencer model and the policy {{prescriptions}} it generates are very sensitive to the underlying assumptions {{on the nature of the}} industry in question, the information available to the national government, its ability to credibly commit to an <b>action</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> likely response of foreign governments. Some of these criticisms were already noted by Brander and Spencer in their paper, where they advised caution.|$|E
5|$|Senator Bricker {{introduced}} another proposal {{later in}} the 83rd Congress and proposed similar constitutional amendments in the 84th and 85th Congresses. While hearings were held in the 84th and 85th Congresses, the full Senate took no <b>action</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> idea of amending the Constitution was never again seriously considered. In part, this was because the Supreme Court issued rulings that undercut arguments for it, notably in Reid v. Covert.|$|E

5|$|Already {{suffering}} from food shortages {{due to a}} five-month drought, President Fidel Castro announced {{that the government would}} supply people under the age of 14 and those over 60, which accounts for roughly 36% of Cuba's population, with extra food aid. An estimated 156,000 tonnes of food was set aside for this <b>action</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> food was worth several million dollars. People who qualified for the aid would receive 4.4lbs (2kg) of rice and peas if they lived in western Cuba and 6.6lbs (3kg) if they lived in eastern Cuba per month until July 1999. The United Nations World Food Program provided $20.5million in aid for both the effects of the drought and Georges. By December, the Cuban Government requested $90million to help recover from the hurricane and drought. By this time, about $40million had already been set aside for the same reason. The Cuban Red Cross supplied shelter for more than 92,000 residents and supplied them with hygiene kits, food, water, and other relief materials.|$|E

5|$|By mid-March, the Prussian {{ships were}} ready for <b>action</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ice had receded far enough that Prince Adalbert ordered Jachmann to conduct a {{reconnaissance}} of the blockading force on 16 March. In the meantime, Dockum's squadron had arrived off Swinemünde two days before. Arcona and Nymphe patrolled off Greifswald, but the weather was very poor, with snow showers hampering visibility. The Prussian gunboats, led by the paddle steamer , remained closer to Swinemünde. Jachmann spotted three vessels at around 15:30, but {{there was not enough}} time before dark to catch them. Instead, Jachmann turned back to Swinemünde, intending to try again the following day.|$|E
5|$|Candide {{contains}} thirty episodic chapters, {{which may}} be grouped into two main schemes: one consists of two divisions, separated by the protagonist's hiatus in El Dorado; the other consists of three parts, each defined by its geographical setting. By the former scheme, {{the first half of}} Candide constitutes the rising <b>action</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> last part the resolution. This view is supported by the strong theme of travel and quest, reminiscent of adventure and picaresque novels, which tend to employ such a dramatic structure. By the latter scheme, the thirty chapters may be grouped into three parts each comprising ten chapters and defined by locale: I–X are set in Europe, XI–XX are set in the Americas, and XXI–XXX are set in Europe and the Ottoman Empire. The plot summary that follows uses this second format and includes Voltaire's additions of 1761.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored is an action-adventure {{game played}} from a first-person {{perspective}} {{with an emphasis}} on stealth <b>action</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> use of gadgets and the environment to eliminate opposing forces. The game world is a series of self-contained, mission-focused areas designed for multiple avenues of exploration in terms of in-game movement and powers. Between missions, the player is taken to a central hub called the Hound Pits pub where the player character Corvo can meet with his allies, receive mission briefings and alternate objectives, and convert recovered loot into new equipment and upgrades. In-game areas include loading docks, royal estates, poverty-stricken streets, and a bathhouse. The player can save their progress anywhere, and the game includes a checkpoint save system. Saving is disabled during combat. The game has four difficulty levels which modify the effectiveness of health and mana (magic) potions, and enemies' awareness, damage delivered, and responsiveness. In the easy setting, health regeneration is possible.|$|E

5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of 10 June a group of senior officers, including General Douglas MacArthur, his air commander General George Kenney, and Australians Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead and Air Vice Marshal William Bostock (head of RAAF Command), made an inspection tour of the Labuan beachhead. MacArthur insisted on seeing Australian soldiers in <b>action,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> party visited a group of front line infantrymen before departing. The process of unloading supplies from the invasion fleet during 10 June proceeded quickly, and the ships began to depart for Morotai during {{the afternoon}} of 11 June.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to slow the Chinese advance, MacArthur ordered the bridges across the Yalu to be bombed. After due {{consultation}} with his advisers, Truman declared {{that he would not}} approve of such an <b>action,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Joint Chiefs cancelled the order. When MacArthur protested, the President and the Joint Chiefs authorized the bombings, subject to the caveat that Chinese air space not be violated. Major General Emmett O'Donnell would later cite this to the Congressional inquiry into MacArthur's relief as an example of undue political interference in military operations. The Yalu River had many bends, and in some cases there were very restricted lines of approach without overflying the Yalu. This made life easier for the Communist antiaircraft gunners, but correspondingly less so for the aircrew. Within weeks, MacArthur was forced to retreat, and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to contemplate the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely.|$|E
5|$|On December 23, 1988, {{the first}} light novel series began publication, {{starting}} with a two volume set for Dragon Quest III. After {{the success of these}} titles, Enix expanded the books into a series and began publishing volumes starting from the first game in sequential order. Enix published titles from every main series game previously released by March 23, 1995, as well as the first Torenko's Mystery Dungeon game. The titles are written from a second-person perspective; the reader determines the next course of <b>action</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stories have multiple endings.|$|E

5|$|On December 5, 1942 Hansell {{received}} his first combat command, the 3rd Bombardment Wing. Originally {{one of the}} three wings of General Headquarters Air Force, the 3rd was now part of the Eighth Air Force in England, planned as a Martin B-26 Marauder unit with the mission of supporting the Eighth's heavy bomber operations by bombing Luftwaffe fighter airfields. However the wing had no aircraft or units yet assigned, and on January 2, 1943, Hansell was shifted to command the 1st Bomb Wing, the B-17 component of VIII Bomber Command. Hansell flew his first mission with his new command the next day to bomb the submarine pens at Saint-Nazaire, France. He saw first hand the effectiveness of German interceptors, as both wingmen of Hansell's bomber were shot down. Later that month, on a January 13 mission to Lille, France, the pilot of the B-17 in which he flew was killed in <b>action</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> plane nearly shot down on.|$|E
5|$|Schmitt {{arrived at}} dusk, {{and the action}} {{continued}} well after dark; in mid-November night falls at close to 17:00 in the upper Danube climes. Despite the darkness, Schmitt descended out of the defiles and deployed his troops to assail Dupont's flank. As his Russians entered the fray, they came between a battalion of French and another of Russians. With the additional force, the French were overwhelmed, {{but most of the}} shooting subsided when the combatants could not tell apart friend from foe in the dark. Under the cover of darkness, aided by a waning moon, Mortier used the French flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troops to the south bank. The French and Russians continued to skirmish fitfully into the night as sentries encountered one another in the dark. Portions of Gazan's force provided any necessary rear guard <b>action,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> following morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore of the Danube, while they maintained possession of only Spitz and Weissenkirchen on the north bank.|$|E
5|$|Siwiec's timing {{has been}} {{described}} as unfortunate, as he chose to commit his act during a dance (mazurka), at which time his cry was muffled due to the sounds of an orchestra playing. Some, like Tomas Kavaliauskas or Krzysztof Kąkolewski, have speculated that if he had chosen to act moments earlier, during a speech by Polish communist leader Władysław Gomułka, first secretary of the Polish United Workers Party, the commotion he caused would have likely interrupted it and his message might have been witnessed more widely. Publicist Antoni Zambrowski noted that many other self-immolators like Czech Jan Palach had cooperated with anti-communist opposition movements and left messages and other documents which helped publicize their activities; Siwiec worked alone and so the Polish anti-communist opposition with which he identified with was not aware of his <b>action</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> meaning behind it until much later.|$|E

5|$|The Government of Croatia {{established}} several {{bodies to}} address the problem of land mines in Croatia; foremost among them are the Office for Mine <b>Action</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Croatian Mine Action Centre. The Office for Mine Action is a government agency tasked with providing expert analysis and advice on demining. The Croatian Mine Action Centre is a public-sector body tasked with planning and conducting demining surveys, accepting cleared areas, marking mine-suspected areas, quality assurance, demining research and development, and victim assistance. The work of the Croatian Mine Action Centre is supervised by the Office for Mine Action.|$|E
5|$|The eight Locusts {{were loaded}} into {{separate}} Hamilcar gliders between 17–20 March, {{and on the}} morning of 24 March were towed from the airfield by Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers to join the rest of the gliders and transport aircraft carrying the two airborne divisions. Weather conditions for the operation were excellent, with clear visibility, and all eight gliders arrived {{in the vicinity of the}} landing zone without incident. During their attempts to land, however, the small force was severely depleted; one glider broke away from the Halifax towing it and disintegrated, apparently as a result of structural failure, with the Locust inside it falling to the ground. Three more gliders came under heavy German anti-aircraft fire and crashed as they landed; one tank survived with a damaged machine gun, another crashed through a house which put its wireless radio set and main armament out of <b>action,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> third broke loose of the glider as it landed and was flipped over onto its turret, rendering it useless.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot with the {{anamorphic}} process. Peckinpah and his cinematographer, Lucien Ballard, also {{made use of}} telephoto lenses, that allowed for objects and people in both the background and foreground to be compressed in perspective. The effect is best seen in the shots where the Bunch makes the walk to Mapache's headquarters to free Angel. As they walk forward, a constant flow of people passes {{between them and the}} camera; {{most of the people in}} the foreground are as sharply focused as the Bunch. The editing of the film is notable in that shots from multiple angles were spliced together in rapid succession, often at different speeds, placing greater emphasis on the chaotic nature of the <b>action</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gunfights.|$|E
