Two particular regimes corresponding to relatively high and low acoustic frequencies are discussed. In the first regime, the <b>acoustoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> in a smooth constriction can be understood by semi-classical considerations based on local conservation laws. For the low frequency regime, we show that the acousto-conductance {{is closely related to}} the zero field conductance.

It is proposed that the grain boundary motions induced by the structural distortion and the propagation of sound waves enhances the energy dissipation around Tc. Whether this structural distortion is the consequence of the onset of a superconducting state remains undetermined. It is also possible that either a tunneling effect or the <b>acoustoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> contributes to sound energy dissipation.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the permittivity of colloidal dispersions has been demonstrated {{to be a very}} useful technique to characterize the electrical state of the solid/liquid interface. This is so because of its sensitivity to such features as particle size and shape, state of aggregation, surface charge, and so on. The dielectric dispersion data are particularly suited to the evaluation of the surface characteristics when the suspension contains a high solids concentration, as in such conditions the usual electrokinetic techniques linked to optical methods are not applicable. The same advantage is shared by electroacoustic techniques, where it is a collective response of the system that matters. In this case, the experimental quantity is the dynamic (or ac) electrophoretic mobility. In this work, both methods will be used for the investigation of the electrical surface characteristics of concentrated alumina suspensions with volume fractions of solids ranging between 1 and 20 %. The data will be analyzed in the frame of the so-called cell model, often used to analyze the hydrodynamic and electrical interactions between particles in concentrated suspensions. We will show that the model is capable of properly describing both their dielectric dispersion and dynamic mobility, and that the surface (zeta) electric potential calculated from electroacoustic data can be used as an input parameter to reproduce the permittivity. This will demonstrate the internal coherence and accuracy of the cell model and give clues to improve our understanding of the electrokinetic behavior of concentrated slurries.

40|$|Acquisition {{of basic}} {{characteristic}} of defects has become possible through a wide class of measurement techniques which probe the interface, the near interface, {{as well as}} the bulk of semiconductor.

The A-DLTS uses the acoustoelectric response signal (ARS) produced by MOS structure interface when a longitudal acoustic wave propagates through a structure.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{experiments that}} have been performed to investigate ultrafast <b>acoustoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> in semiconductor devices. Current commonly employed techniques to generate ultrafast acoustic pulses and detect them with spectral resolution require a powerful pulsed laser system that is bulky, expensive and complicated. If the acoustic pulses could instead be generated and detected by electrical methods, picosecond acoustic techniques could become more readily available {{as a tool for}} other users. This thesis focusses on the electrical detection of acoustic pulses with spectral resolution. In many of the key experiments described in this thesis a picosecond strain pulse was generated optically on the opposite face of the sample to the semiconductor device of interest. The strain was generated either in a thin Al film thermally deposited on the sample surface, or directly in the GaAs substrate. Acoustic phonons generated by this method propagated across the substrate to the device. Transient voltages across the semiconductor device caused by the incident phonons were detected using a high frequency real-time oscilloscope. The first evidence of heterodyne mixing of coherent acoustic phonons with microwaves was obtained, for frequencies up to about 100 GHz. First, it was confirmed that Schottky diodes can produce a fast transient voltage in response to an incident acoustic wavepacket. The detection process occurs at the semiconductor-metal interface, and is due to the deformation potential. Bow-tie antenna fabricated directly onto the GaAs substrate proved to be ineffective at coupling microwaves from free space to the Schottky diode. A waveguide-coupled beam-lead Schottky diode provided by e 2 v had a sufficient response to the incident microwaves to proceed with the mixing experiments. The microwave local oscillator signal was mixed with a tunable narrow frequency band acoustic signal that was produced using a Fabry-Perot etalon external to the laser cavity. The intermediate frequency components were in the range of 1 - 12 GHz, which could be detected on the oscilloscope. Mixing was performed using both the fundamental frequency acoustic wave and the second harmonic generated in the sample. Semiconductor superlattices were also investigated as electrical detectors for ultrafast acoustic pulses. In this case, the transient voltage measured across the device contained an unexpected contribution {{in the form of a}} peak with a width of approximately 2 ns. This signal is too slow to be caused by a strain pulse and too fast for a heat pulse. It is proposed that this peak is caused by long-lived phonon modes from the centre of the mini-Brillouin zone being confined in the superlattice due to Bragg reflections. The peak caused by confined phonons and the two peaks caused by heat pulses also present in the detected signal were investigated for a range of experimental conditions. This allowed comparisons to be made to previous works. A similar superlattice structure had a very different response to the incident acoustic wavepacket. The polarity of the transient voltage detected was inverted and there was no evidence of an electronic response to the confined phonon modes, which would have been present in both samples. It is proposed that the barriers of the NU 1727 superlattice sample are thicker than expected, and this strongly affects the electron transport through the structure. This thesis shows that semiconductor devices can be suitable for the electrical detection of ultrafast strain pulses. For this technique to reach its full potential, it is also necessary to be able to generate these strain pulses electrically. A step recovery diode has been considered for this purpose as part of the suggested future work...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasound Current Source Density Imaging (UCSDI) is a noninvasive {{modality}} for mapping electrical {{activities in}} the body (brain and heart) in 4 -dimensions (space + time). Conventional cardiac mapping technologies for guiding the radiofrequency ablation procedure for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias have certain limitations. UCSDI can potentially overcome these limitations and enhance the electrophysiology mapping of the heart. UCSDI exploits the <b>acoustoelectric</b> (AE) <b>effect,</b> an interaction between ultrasound pressure and electrical resistivity. When an ultrasound beam intersects a current path in a material, the local resistivity of the material is modulated by the ultrasonic pressure, and a change in voltage signal can be detected based on Ohm's Law. The degree of modulation {{is determined by the}} AE interaction constant K. K is a fundamental property of any type of material, and directly affects the amplitude of the AE signal detected in UCSDI. UCSDI requires detecting a small AE signal associated with electrocardiogram. So sensitivity becomes a major challenge for transferring UCSDI to the clinic. This dissertation will determine the limits of sensitivity and resolution for UCSDI, balancing the tradeoff between them by finding the optimal parameters for electrical cardiac mapping, and finally test the optimized system in a realistic setting. This work begins by describing a technique for measuring K, the AE interaction constant, in ionic solution and biological tissue, and reporting the value of K in excised rabbit cardiac tissue for the first time. K was found to be strongly dependent on concentration for the divalent salt CuSO₄, but not for the monovalent salt NaCl, consistent with their different chemical properties. In the rabbit heart tissue, K was determined to be 0. 041 ± 0. 012 %/MPa, similar to the measurement of K in physiologic saline: 0. 034 ± 0. 003 %/MPa. Next, this dissertation investigates the sensitivity limit of UCSDI by quantifying the relation between the recording electrode distance and the measured AE signal amplitude in gel phantoms and excised porcine heart tissue using a clinical intracardiac catheter. Sensitivity of UCSDI with catheter was 4. 7 μV/mA (R² = 0. 999) in cylindrical gel (0. 9 % NaCl), and 3. 2 μV/mA (R² = 0. 92) in porcine heart tissue. The AE signal was detectable more than 25 mm away from the source in cylindrical gel (0. 9 % NaCl). Effect of transducer properties on UCSDI sensitivity is also investigated using simulation. The optimal ultrasound transducer parameters chosen for cardiac imaging are center frequency = 0. 5 MHz and f/number = 1. 4. Last but not least, this dissertation shows the result of implementing the optimized ultrasound parameters in live rabbit heart preparation, the comparison of different recording electrode configuration and multichannel UCSDI recording and reconstruction. The AE signal detected using the 0. 5 MHz transducer was much stronger (2. 99 μV/MPa) than the 1. 0 MHz transducer (0. 42 μV/MPa). The clinical lasso catheter placed on the epicardium exhibited excellent sensitivity without being too invasive. 3 -dimensional cardiac activation maps of the live rabbit heart using only one pair of recording electrodes were also demonstrated for the first time. Cardiac conduction velocity for atrial (1. 31 m/s) and apical (0. 67 m/s) pacing were calculated based on the activation maps. The future outlook of this dissertation includes integrating UCSDI with 2 -dimensional ultrasound transducer array for fast imaging, and developing a multi-modality catheter with 4 -dimensional UCSDI, multi-electrode recording and echocardiography capacity...|$|R

40|$|The acoustoelectric {{interaction}} in InSb is developed and investigated {{on the basis}} of a hydrodynamical theory. Comparison of numerical results obtained from this theory with the corresponding numerical results from more detailed microscopic theories reveals that the essential features of the microscopic theories are also present in the simpler hydrodynamical theory. In particular, the hydrodynamical theory accounts for the existence of two distinct modes of acoustic domain formation and for the reduction of peak acoustic gain at low values of magnetic field. Valuable insight into the physical basis of the <b>acoustoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> is obtained and it is shown that in the limit of large electron drift velocities and small transverse magnetic field strengths, the Mode I‐type acoustoelectric interaction arises from a drift‐enhanced quenching of electron diffusion effects. Moreover it is found that the frequency of maximum acoustoelectric gain, as given by the hydrodynamical theory of the present paper, does not occur at the fixed frequency f 0 = (ωRωD) 1 ∕ 2 ∕ 2 π, but rather, it is dependent upon the exact values of drift velocity and magnetic field strength.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Springer Nature via the DOI in this record. Surface {{acoustic}} waves (SAWs) propagating on piezoelectric substrates offer a convenient, contactless approach to probing the electronic properties of low-dimensional charge carrier systems such as graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). SAWs can also be used to transport and manipulate charge for applications such as metrology and quantum information. In this work, we investigate the <b>acoustoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> in GNRs, and show that an acoustoelectric current can be generated in GNRs with physical widths as small as 200 [*]nm at room temperature. The positive current in the direction of the SAWs, which corresponds to the transportation of holes, exhibits a linear dependence on SAW intensity and frequency. This is consistent with the description of the interaction between the charge carriers in the GNRs and the piezoelectric fields associated with the SAWs being described by a relatively simple classical relaxation model. Somewhat counter-intuitively, as the GNR width is decreased, the measured acoustoelectric current increases. This is thought to be caused by an increase of the carrier mobility due to increased doping arising from damage to the GNR edges. G. R.

40|$|The current {{saturation}} {{associated with}} the <b>acoustoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> has been investigated in photoconducting crystals of cadmium sulphide. Under normal band gap irradiation the current-voltage characteristic measured under pulsed conditions shows a departure from Ohm's law at a critical field, E(_c), {{of the order of}} l 0 (^ 3) v cm(^- 1). The current saturation is {{associated with the}} internal generation of acoustic flux which occurs when the electron drift velocity, v(_d), exceeds the velocity of sound, v(_s), in the crystal. In consequence the critical field for saturation is determined by the drift mobility µ(_d) = v(_s) /E(_c). The work described in this thesis concerns the measurement of the drift mobility and its relationship to the experimentally determined Hall mobility, fd^, as a function of conductivity and temperature. In uniform samples the critical field at room temperature was independent of conductivity over the range 10 (^- 4) to 10 (^- 2) ohm(^- 1) cm(^- 1). The corresponding values of µ(_d) were all about 300 cm(^ 2) v(^- 1) sec(^- 1) in most of the samples studied and agreed well with the measured values of the Hall mobility. With non-uniform samples, however, the critical field varied strongly with the intensity of incident illumination. Under saturated conditions potential probe measurements on uniform samples revealed the presence of a stationary high field domain near the positive electrode...|$|E
40|$|The <b>acoustoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> in {{single-layer}} {{molybdenum disulfide}} (MoS 2) and tungsten diselenide (WSe 2) is studied in a hybrid setup. Such effects, which {{rely on the}} transfer of momentum from surface acoustic waves (SAWs), are generated {{on the surface of}} lithium niobate (LiNbO 3) to the carriers in MoS 2 and WSe 2, resulting in an attenuation and velocity shift of the wave and giving rise to an acoustoelectric current. This dissertation examines the feasibility of integrating high-quality, single-layer MoS 2 and WSe 2 onto LiNbO 3 to ultimately fabricate and characterize a hybrid chip that combines the functionality of a field-effect transistor (FET) and SAW device. MoS 2 and WSe 2 were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) directly onto a chemically-reduced LiNbO 3 substrate. LiNbO 3 is a ferroelectric material that offers a unique blend of piezoelectric and birefringent properties, yet it lacks both optical activity and semiconductor transport. The prototypical device exhibits electrical characteristics that are competitive with MoS 2 and WSe 2 devices on silicon. These results demonstrate both a sound-driven battery and an acoustic photodetector, and ultimately open directions to non-invasive investigation of electrical properties of single-layer films. The experiments reveal close agreement between transport measurements utilizing conventional contacts and SAW spectroscopy. This approach will set forth the possibility of contact-free transport characterization of two-dimensional (2 D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) films, avoiding such concerns as the role of charge transfer at contacts as an artifact of such measurements...|$|E
40|$|By {{use of the}} <b>acoustoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> of {{the surface}} {{acoustic}} wave, we study the transport properties of carriers through a quasi-one-dimensional quantum channel. The channel length {{in this study is}} fixed at 4 μm. We have fabricated four samples with channel width of 500 nm, 700 nm, 1. 2 μm and 1. 4 μm, respectively. We can control the bias of the split gates of the 1. 2 -μm device to change the effective width of the channel at the temperature of 0. 3 K. The surface acoustic wave is provided by an interdigital transducer with thirty-seven pairs of electrodes whose operating frequency is 648 MHz. All of these fine patterns are defined by e-beam lithography. We have studied the acoustoelectric current through the quasi-one-dimensional channel in various applied magnetic fields and under different gate bias. 本實驗是利用表面聲波(SAW) 所伴隨之電場，推動電子通過準一維之量子通道，並探討外加磁場之特性。 在元件製作方面，我們運用光微影及電子束微影技術成功製作出可供低溫量測的元件，尤其在電子束微影技術方面，成功製作出通道長度為 4 μm，寬度分別為 500 nm、 700 nm、 1. 2 μm、 1. 4 μm之量子通道，而其中寬度為 1. 2 μm之量子通道可以用一對分離閘極(split gate) ，藉著改變閘極偏壓(VG) 來控制此量子通道的寬度。而在表面聲波製作方面，已經可以很穩定的製作出中心頻率為 648 MHz，對數 37 對之梳狀電極(Interdigital Transducer，IDT) 。在低溫量測上，當表面聲波帶動電子通過量子通道時，我們可藉著改變磁場來量測聲電電流傳輸效應，也可藉著改變閘極負偏壓(VG) 去觀測一維量子通道寬度變化所產生的現象。中文摘要…………………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅰ 英文摘要………………………………………………………………………… [...] …Ⅱ 致謝……………………………………………………………………………… [...] …Ⅲ 目錄……………………………………………………………………………… [...] …Ⅳ 圖表索引………………………………………………………………………… [...] …Ⅵ 第一章 緒論……………………………………………………………………… [...] … 1 1. 1 表面聲波(Surface Acoustic Wave) 的發展歷史及基本特性簡介…………. … 1 1. 2 一維量子通道之聲電效應原理及應用………………………………………. 2 1. 3 二維電子系統之量子霍爾效應……………………………………………. … 4 第二章 元件製作與封裝…………………………………………………………… 11 2. 1 樣品介紹………………………………………………………………… [...] . … 11 2. 2 元件製作………………………………………………………… [...] . ………… 11 2. 2. 1 光微影製作流程………………………………………………………… 12 2. 2. 2 電子束微影製作流程…………………………………………………… 16 2. 3 元件封裝…………………………………………………………… [...] . ……… 19 第三章 量測系統與方法…………………………………………………………… 37 3. 1 He 3 低溫系統………………………………………………………………… [...] 37 3. 2 高頻訊號測試……………………………………………………… [...] ………. 38 3. 2. 1 高頻線轉接板及樣品基板設計製作…………………………………… 38 3. 2. 2 高頻線訊號測試結果…………………………………………………… 40 3. 3 高頻量測與低頻量測系統配置與方法…………………………………… [...] . 41 第四章 實驗數據分析討論及結論………………………………………………… 50 4. 1 DC 磁傳輸性質量測與討論…………………………………… [...] . ……… [...] 50 4. 2 一維量子通道之聲電效應量測結果與討論…………………… [...] …………. 51 4. 3 元件製作檢討………………………………………………………………… 54 4. 4 結論……………………………………………………………………… [...] . … 55 參考資料…………………………………………………………………………… [...] 81 附錄一 黃光微影製程參數………………………………………………………… 83 附錄二 電子束微影製程參數……………………………………………………… 8...|$|E
