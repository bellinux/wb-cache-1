During her time with TNA, James made several appearances for independent wrestling promotions such as Pro Championship Wrestling, Legends of the Ring, Northeast Wrestling and National Wrestling Superstars.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} may not develop <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>or</b> may be fused in the midline behind the aorta. These are {{associated}} with other congenital abnormalities, such as failure of the kidneys to develop, or fused kidneys. The gland may develop with a partial or complete absence of the cortex, or may develop in an unusual location.|$|E

5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a cadaver did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, {{and many of the}} signs are little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>or,</b> ironically, to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.|$|E
25|$|Giants are {{referred}} to {{only a few times}} by Tolkien, leading some readers to debate whether they existed <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>or</b> if they were simply Ents or metaphorical descriptions of the power of nature. Stone-giants of the Misty Mountains are said to lob stones at Thorin and Company in The Hobbit.|$|E
25|$|Similar debate {{surrounds}} the Indus script of the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilization in Ancient India (2600 BC). In addition, the script is still undeciphered, {{and there is}} debate about whether the script is true writing <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>or,</b> instead, some kind of proto-writing or nonlinguistic sign system.|$|E

25|$|A {{quarter of}} the convicts were Irish. Many had been arrested in Ireland, and some in Great Britain. Many, if not most, of the Irish spoke Irish and either no English <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>or</b> spoke it poorly and rarely. There were other {{significant}} populations of convicts from non-English speaking part of Britain, such as the Scottish Highlands and Wales.|$|E
25|$|In May 2008, {{the debt}} charity Credit Action made a {{complaint}} to the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading (OFT) that payday lenders were placing advertising which violated advertising regulations {{on the social}} network website Facebook. The main complaint was that the APR was either not displayed <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>or</b> not displayed prominently enough, which is clearly required by UK advertising standards.|$|E
25|$|May 31, 2007: Attorneys for Michael Addison {{stated that}} the New Hampshire Supreme Court should halt all {{proceedings}} due to claims of how the courts handled the death penalty case for Addison. These claims included that the court should not impose the death penalty case <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>or</b> that it enact certain rules pertaining to how the courts would handle a death sentence.|$|E

25|$|Coverage figures do {{not give}} an {{indication}} of service quality, which is generally quite poor. In rural areas, systems have often fallen into disrepair. They either do not provide any water service <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>or</b> provide service only to those close to the source, with those {{at the end of}} the system ("tail-enders") remaining without water. In almost all urban areas water supply is intermittent.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately {{there is}} little {{agreement}} amongst the different American judgments and textbooks as to whether such a separate doctrine exists <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>or</b> {{the circumstances in which}} it would apply. There {{does not appear to be}} any recorded judicial decision in which it has been applied. However, conceptually, to the extent it exists, the doctrine would be an important derogation from the general principle that awards are not subject to review by the courts.|$|E
25|$|The {{footage of}} the BBC and ITV {{coverage}} became victim to the current broadcasting policy of either eventually erasing videotapes or simply not keeping them. It is not definitely known {{what happened to the}} original tapes. This led to rumours that they were taped over almost immediately with horse racing, that the coverage was barely taped <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>or</b> that the tapes fell to bits during digital remastering. All these rumours have since been discounted.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} of Lepospondyli {{in relation to}} other labyrinthodont groups is uncertain, and it is sometimes classified as a separate subclass. The teeth were not labyrinthodont, and the group has classically been seen as separate from the Labyrintyhodontia. There is some doubt as to whether the lepospondyls form a phylogenetic unit <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>or</b> is a wastebin taxon containing the paedamorphic forms and tadpoles of other labyrinthodonts, notably the reptile-like amphibians, or even very small primitve amniotes with reduced skulls.|$|E
25|$|Very high {{rotational}} speeds—30,000 to 100,000 RPM or even higher—are used; this {{translates to}} a reasonably fast linear {{speed of the}} cutting tip in these very small diameters. The high speed, small diameter, and the brittleness of the material, make the bits very subject to breaking, particularly if {{the angle of the}} bit to the workpiece changes <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>or</b> the bit contacts any object. Drilling by hand is not practicable, and many general-purpose drilling machines designed for larger bits rotate too slowly and wobble too much to use carbide bits effectively.|$|E
25|$|The Chronicle makes {{every effort}} to achieve a calm, {{restrained}} tone. Unfortunately, the materials with which the Chronicle is dealing evoke emotional reactions, and these automatically affect {{the tone of the}} text. The Chronicle does, and will do, its utmost to ensure that its strictly factual style is maintained to the greatest degree possible, but it cannot guarantee complete success. The Chronicle tries to refrain from making value judgments — either by not making them <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>or</b> by referring to judgments made in samizdat documents.|$|E

25|$|His contemporaries {{associated}} {{him with}} Socrates {{as a leader}} of a decadent intellectualism, both of them being frequently lampooned by comic poets such as Aristophanes. Whereas Socrates was eventually put on trial and executed as a corrupting influence, Euripides chose a voluntary exile in old age, dying in Macedonia. Recent scholarship casts doubt on ancient biographies of Euripides. For example, it is possible that he never visited Macedonia <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>or,</b> if he did, he might have been drawn there by King Archelaus with incentives that were also offered to other artists.|$|E
25|$|Encouraged {{by these}} results, {{a full season}} with Hesketh was planned for 1976. In the South African Grand Prix he {{qualified}} in the last row and finished 15th. The next races saw him either not qualify <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>or</b> {{at the back of}} the grid, with early retirements due to mechanical failures. Despite not being satisfied with the value the team gave him for the money, he almost scored a point when coming in seventh at the 1976 British Grand Prix, albeit three laps down.|$|E
25|$|Per capita {{water use}} in Georgia varies greatly between localities. In 2003 it varied between 743 liters/capita/day in Tbilisi and only 31 liters in Zugdidi, {{a small town}} in Western Georgia. This compares to 100 - 150 liters in Central Europe. Consumption was {{estimated}} at 94 liters in Rustavi, 116 liters in Kutaisi and 432 liters in Batumi. The mean time of supply per day was estimated at 12 hours, with the lowest value being 3 hours {{in the small town of}} Gurjaani in Eastern Georgia. In many towns water was not disinfected <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>or</b> only seasonally.|$|E
