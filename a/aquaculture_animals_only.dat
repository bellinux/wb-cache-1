40|$|ABSTRACT Infectious {{disease is}} a major {{constraint}} for all species produced via aquaculture. The majority of farmed fish and shellfish production is based on stocks with limited or no selective breeding. Since disease resistance is almost universally heritable, there is huge potential to select for improved resistance to key diseases. This short review discusses the current methods of breeding more resistant aquaculture stocks, with success stories and current bottlenecks highlighted. The current implementation of genomic selection in {{breeding for disease resistance}} and routes to wider-scale implementation and improvement in aquaculture are discussed. Future directions are highlighted, including the potential of genome editing tools for mapping causative variation underlying disease resistance traits and for breeding <b>aquaculture</b> <b>animals</b> with enhanced resistance to disease...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Vibrio harveyi causes {{vibriosis}} to Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer). The disease spreads rapidly among fish stocked in {{the same}} cage. It causes high mortality especially in weak and small sized fish stocked at high density in poorly managed net cage. Study to determine the virulence levels of the bacterial pathogen in various <b>aquaculture</b> <b>animals</b> {{is a key to}} prevent vibriosis in marine aquaculture. Methodology and Result: Isolation of bacteria from diseased Asian seabass was done using tryptic soy agar (TSA) and thiosulphate citrate bile sucrose agar (TCBS) plates. Virulence of two strains of Vibrio harveyi (VHJR 4 and VHJR 7) was tested against clinically healthy <b>aquaculture</b> <b>animals.</b> The analysis revealed that the two bacterial strains differ in pathogenicity. The V. harveyi strain VHJR 7 was virulent to Asian seabass at 1. 40 x 104 c. f. u. g- 1, humpback grouper(Cromileptis altivelis) at LD 50 8. 33 x 103 c. f. u. g- 1 and black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) at LD 50 3. 26 x 104 c. f. u. g- 1,respectively. The V. harveyi strain VHJR 4 was not virulent to Asian seabass and humpback grouper but it caused mortality to black tiger shrimp at LD 50 1. 32 x 106 c. f. u. g- 1. Phenotypically, the two strains shared most of the biochemical features except that the V. harveyi strain VHJR 7 was a urease positive and grew at 8. 5 % NaCl, and at 10 °C. The percentage similarity of nucleotide sequences of 16 S rDNA in V. harveyi VHJR 4 and V. harveyi VHJR 7 was higher (99 %) but reduced at 95 % in hemolysin gene. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: Pathogenic strain of V. harveyi causes mortality and affects aquaculture production of Asian seabass. Hence, vaccine development against the bacterial pathogen is urgently needed for sustainability of Asian seabass aquaculture in Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|The {{outbreak}} of pathogens can induce diseases {{and lead to}} massive mortalities of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>animals</b> including fish, mollusk and shrimp. In this work, the responses induced by Micrococcus luteus and Vibrio anguillarum were investigated in hepatopancreas of mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis using proteomics and metabolomics. Metabolic biomarkers demonstrated that M. luteus and V. anguillarum injections could induce osmotic stress and disturbance in energy metabolism. And the uniquely and more markedly altered metabolic biomarkers (glutamine, succinate, aspartate, glucose, ATP, homarine and tyrosine) indicated that V. anguillarum could cause more severe disturbances in osmotic regulation and energy metabolism. The differentially altered proteins meant that M. luteus and V. anguillarum induced different effects in mussels. However, the common proteomic biomarkers, arginine kinase and small heat shock protein, demonstrated that these two bacteria induced similar effects including oxidative stress and disturbance in energy metabolism in M. galloprovincialis. In addition, some metabolic biomarkers, ATP and glutamine, were confirmed by related proteins including arginine kinase, ATP synthase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase and glutamine synthetase in bacteria-challenged mussels. This study demonstrated that proteomics and metabolomics could provide an insightful view into the effects of environmental pathogens to the marine mussel M. galloprovincialis. Biological significance The {{outbreak of}} pathogens can lead to diseases and massive mortalities of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>animals</b> including fish, mollusk and shrimp.

In the present study, an integrated metabolomic and proteomic approach was used to elucidate the differential effects induced by the representative Gram-positive (M. luteus) and Gram-negative (V. anguillarum) bacteria in M. galloprovincialis.

We argue that ecological theory could serve as a foundation for developing sustainable microbial management methods that prevent pathogenic disease in larviculture. Management of the water microbiota in aquaculture systems according to ecological selection principles has been shown to decrease opportunistic pathogen pressure and to result in an improved performance of the cultured animals.
