40|$|Diamonds are {{the most}} {{precious}} material all over the world. Ever since their discovery, the desire for natural diamonds has been great; recently, the demand has steeply increased, leading to scarcity. For example, in 2010, diamonds worth 50 billion were marketed. This increased demand has led to discovering alternative sources to replace diamonds. The diamond, being the hardest material on earth, could be replaced with no other material except another diamond. Thus, the industrial or synthetic diamond was invented. Because of extreme hardness is one of diamond 2 ̆ 7 s properties, diamonds are used in cutting operations. The fracture strength of diamond {{is one of the}} crucial factors that determine its life time as a cutting tool. Glow discharge is one of the techniques used for plasma formation. The glow discharge process is conducted in a vacuum chamber by ionizing gas atoms. Ions penetrate into the atomic structure, ejecting a secondary electron. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the change in fracture strength of industrial diamond powder before and after plasma treatment. This study focuses mainly on the change in crystal defects and crushing strength (CS) of industrial diamond powder after the penetration of hydrogen gas, air and hydrogen-air mixture ions into the sample powder. For this study, an industrial diamond powder sample of 100 carats weight, along with its average fracture strength value was received from Engis Corporation, Illinois. The sample was divided into parts, each weighing 10 - 12 carats. At the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), a plasma test was conducted on six sample parts for a total of 16 hours on each part. The three gas types mentioned above were used during plasma tests, with the pressure in vacuum chamber between 200 mTorr and 2 Torr. The plasma test on four sample parts was in the presence of hydrogen-air mixture. The first sample had chamber pressures between 200 mTorr and 400 mTorr. The remaining three samples had chamber pressures between 600 mTorr and 1 Torr. The fifth sample part underwent plasma in the presence of atmospheric air, due to <b>accidental</b> <b>closing</b> of the hydrogen valve, at pressure levels 200 mTorr to 400 mTorr. On the last sample, the plasma test was carried out in hydrogen gas at pressures of 1 and 2 Torr. X Ray Diffraction (XRD) was conducted at UNLV before and after plasma tests. The samples were shipped back to Engis Corporation to test the difference in CS after plasma treatment. The XRD results revealed that plasma experiment had no significant change in lattice constants on diamond powder. However, the crystal defect concentrations increased due to change in full width half maximum (FWHM), but the samples are in a highly crystalline state since the change is very small. FWHM after plasma is higher than that before plasma. This confirms a change in defect concentration after plasma. The plasma test conducted in hydrogen gas increased the CS of diamond powders by 0. 4...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} and characterizes mixed direct-iterative {{methods for}} boundary integral formulations of continuum dielectric solvation models. We give an example, the Ca{sup ++}{hor_ellipsis}Cl{sup {minus}} pair potential of mean force in aqueous solution, {{for which a}} direct solution at thermal accuracy is difficult and, thus for which mixed direct-iterative methods seem necessary to obtain the required high resolution. For the simplest such formulations, Gauss-Seidel iteration diverges in rare cases. This difficulty is analyzed by obtaining the eigenvalues and the spectral radius of the non-symmetric iteration matrix. This establishes that those divergences are due to inaccuracies of the asymptotic approximations used in evaluation of the matrix elements corresponding to <b>accidental</b> <b>close</b> encounters of boundary elements on different atomic spheres. The spectral radii are then greater than one for those diverging cases. This problem is cured by checking for boundary element pairs closer than the typical spatial extent of the boundary elements and for those cases performing an ``in-line`` Monte Carlo integration to evaluate the required matrix elements. These difficulties are not expected and have not been observed for the thoroughly coarsened equations obtained when only a direct solution is sought. Finally, we give an example application of hybrid quantum-classical methods to deprotonation of orthosilicic acid in water...|$|R

As its corollary, boundary slopes of accidental essential surfaces are integral or meridional. It is shown that an accidental incompressible Seifert surface is totally knotted. Example of satellite knot with arbitrarily high genus Seifert surfaces with acci-dental peripherals is given, and a Haken 3 -manifold which contains a hyperbolic knot with an accidental incompressible Seifert surface is also given. 1...|$|R

Track II: Transportation and BiofuelsWith the intensified {{energy and}} environmental concerns, hydrogen {{is considered to be}} one of the viable solutions to the increasing demands for clean and secure energy. The transition from fossil fuels to such technologies involves challenges that must be overcome for widespread public use/acceptance. Safety issues need to be fully addressed by developing proper codes and standards that are critical for the design and operation of hydrogen-powered systems. Fire safety of hydrogen applications is generally provided by experience from other traditional fuels whose properties are drastically different from those of hydrogen. As part of a broader project to establish the first hydrogen fueling station and hydrogen-powered commuter service in the state of Missouri, the transient behavior of hydrogen mixing and the associated flammability limits in air are investigated to support the fire safety and prevention guidelines. Advanced computer simulations are developed and utilized to gain a comprehensive understanding of the unsteady mixing, leakage, and flammability of hydrogen under simple and practical conditions. Different hydrogen accidental release scenarios were studied and compared with that of traditional fuels like methane and ethane. The observed complex temporal and spatial distributions of hydrogen demonstrate the fast formation of flammable zones. These results have implications in the safe and efficient use of hydrogen in various applications (e. g., fuel cells) as well as the ventilation of hydrogen <b>accidental</b> leakage in <b>closed</b> and partially closed environments (e. g., parking garage, storage facilities, road tunnel) and other supplementary infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{presented}} article – {{identification of}} interrelation of certain type of organizational culture in {{institute of education}} (<b>closed,</b> <b>accidental,</b> open or synchronous) and level of development of professional deformation of personality of teachers (authoritativeness, rigidity and noncriticality of self-perception). The basis for methodology of research is sociocultural-interdeterministic dialogical approach of V. A. Yanchuk. In the course of research psychodiagnostic techniques were applied: technique of diagnostics of professional deformation of personality of teacher (V. E. Orel, S. P. Andreyev) and questionnaire of «Scale of organizational paradigms» of L. L. Konstantin. Results of research of six institutes of education (schools and gymnasiums)  showed that elements of deformation have higher level of manifestation in institutes with closed type of organizational culture, revealed in three institutes, and insignificant level in two institutes with open type of culture. In institutes with prevalence of synchronous and accidental types of organizational culture significant exceeding {{on the level of}} deformation didn’t find. The greatest development of deformation of teachers is observed on elements of authoritativeness and rigidity, the smallest – on noncriticality of self-perception. Scientific novelty of material is presented for the first time applied sociocultural-interdeterministic dialogical approach to research of professional deformation of personality, that psychological interdeterminant of deformation are allocated, one of structural components of model of ecocultural educational environment – open type of organizational culture in institute of education are described. Practical significance of results consists in detection of opportunities and criteria of formation in institute of formation of ecocultural dialogical environment and its structural component for purpose of timely prevention and overcoming of professional deformation of personality of teachers, to creation of prerequisites for increase of efficiency of interaction among participants of educational process. </p...|$|R
6000|$|Fuglemen {{the world}} and its Nations always have, when {{simultaneously}} bent any-whither, wisely or unwisely; and it is natural that the most adventurous spirit take that post. Friedrich has not sought the post; but following his own objects, has got it; and will be ignominiously lost, and trampled to annihilation under the hoofs of the world, if he do not mind! To keep well ahead;--to be rapid as possible; that were good:--to step aside were still better! And Friedrich we find is very anxious for that; [...] "would be content with the Duchy of Glogau, and join Austria;" [...] but there is not the least chance that way. His Special Envoy to Vienna, Gotter, and along with him Borck the regular Minister, are come home; all negotiation hopeless at Vienna; and nothing but indignant war-preparation going on there, with the most animated diligence, and more success than had seemed possible. That is the law of Friedrich's Silesian Adventure: [...] "Forward, therefore, on these terms; others there are not: waste no words!" [...] Friedrich recognizes to himself what the law is; pushes stiffly forward, with a fine silence on all that is not practical, really with a fine steadiness of hope, and audacity against discouragements. Of his anxieties, which could not well be wanting, but which it is royal to keep strictly under lock and key, of these there is no hint to Jordan or to anybody; and only through <b>accidental</b> chinks, on <b>close</b> scrutiny, can we discover that they exist. Symptom of despondency, of misgiving or repenting about his Enterprise, there is none anywhere, Friedrich's fine gifts of SILENCE (which go deeper than the lips) are noticeable here, as always; and highly they availed Friedrich in leading his life, though now inconvenient to Biographers writing of the same!-- ...|$|R
