40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{probe the}} effects of {{acupuncture}} reinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> methods on the human body. MethodsStudied acupuncture reinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> actions in the ancient literature, based on modern clinical and experimental studies, in combination with experience of acupuncture teaching and clinical treatment. ResultsThe key to the generation of reinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> actions is not the acupuncture reinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> methods themselves, but instead the functional state of the patient during the acupuncture. When reinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> methods act on the human body, a reinforcing-reducing effect is produced through regulation of Qi, indicating that {{the production of the}} reinforcing-reducing effect requires a certain condition. Specifically, acupuncture does not produce the reinforcing-reducing effect under all conditions, but can produce a reinforcing effect in patients with deficiency syndrome <b>and</b> a <b>reducing</b> effect in patients with excess syndrome. ConclusionReinforcing <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> methods each have therapeutic effects on both deficiency syndrome and excess syndrome, but a reinforcing method should be selected first for deficiency syndrome <b>and</b> a <b>reducing</b> method should be selected first for excess syndrome...|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of the de novo pathway, the salvage reactions are essential in humans; a lack of niacin in the diet causes the vitamin deficiency disease pellagra.

40|$|Abstract. A new {{mechanism}} of saving energy <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> pollution is brought forward by analyzing water characters in high temperature condition and all factors which bring saving energy <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> {{pollution in the}} combustion process of emulsification oil. The theory shows that the reason of saving energy <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> pollution is that emulsification oil can reduce surplus air ratio effectively in the combustion process. These reasons include that of improving the burning flame temperature, avoiding the local super-high temperature, decreasing the amount of NOX and the conversion of SO 2 oxidize to SO 3, strengthening the burning and heat transmission <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> the soot of the flue gas. By this new theory, the reasons of saving energy <b>and</b> <b>reducing</b> pollution in the combustion process of emulsification gasoline, emulsification diesel oil, emulsification heavy oil and other slurry fuel of W/O or O/W can be well explained. At the same time, the new mechanism was well validated in the combustion process of hard asphalt water slurry...|$|R
