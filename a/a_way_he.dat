The operating system he designed spread to other users in the company, and formed the core of what would be named in 1970 the Unix operating system. Space Travel was one of the early mainframe games developed before the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early history of video games, and was never distributed beyond its initial locations. As a result, it had no effect on future video games, and its primary legacy is that of sparking the creation of Unix.|$|E

25|$|With Lord Fitzwilliam, in Grosvenor Square, for {{the purpose}} of {{discussing}} the subject of a coalition with him, and of endeavouring to prevail on him to speak to Fox—Lord Fitzwilliam's sentiments perfectly right—he said his opposition never had been to the constitution of the country, but to the Government when it acted in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> thought contrary to the constitution; that, therefore, when that was in danger he ceased to be in opposition. On going over the matter it became evident that the great obstacle would arise from Fox's being too much entangled with Grey, Lambton, and that set of men who had lately separated themselves from the party, in order to form a party of their own, and who publicly professed doctrines and opinions in direct opposition to what he and I considered to be for the good and welfare of the public. That this would indeed be very hard and unreasonable, that for the sake of these very men, who both in their public and private capacity had been as inimical as possible, an arrangement should be broken off so salutary and so advisable. Lord Fitzwilliani and myself agreed on every point; he, however, went beyond me in insisting on the indispensable necessity of Pitt resigning the Treasury for another Cabinet office. He acquiesced in the wisdom of trying to bring Fox to be less attached to these false friends, and said Tom Grenville was the best man to speak to him. Lord Fitzwilliam expressed his dislike to Sheridan, said he might have a lucrative place, but never could be admitted to one of trust and confidence. On my wishing him not to leave town, he said he could safely trust his conscience with the Duke of Portland, and was at the same time ready to return at the shortest notice.|$|E

500|$|Sveriges Radio {{stipulated that}} the work had to include a Swedish element. Singer Russell Mael told The National, [...] "At first, we {{obviously}} thought of cars and Ikea. I'm joking. But the more profound, more lasting idea – being the film fans we are – was Ingmar Bergman. So we hit upon a fantasy situation of him going to Hollywood, which is obviously a lot more universal, too." [...] Before starting work on the musical, the Mael brothers decided to refresh their memories by looking at Bergman's films again. [...] "We were both really big film fans in university. At that time unless you only liked foreign film, and hated American ones, you weren't cool", Ron Mael told The Times. [...] "There was a real kind of seriousness to [...] He actually addressed big things {{and was able to}} frame those in really pure, cinematic ways. Now those things are seen as being kind of pretentious. Everyone wants to be seen as though they don't care about the big issues." [...] Commenting on the suitability of Bergman as the topic of a musical, Russell Mael told a Swedish newspaper, [...] "In <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> is the least appropriate person for a musical. We like the absurdity of it all. He was such a deep, intense person {{and the vast majority of}} his films are about really deep topics. But we did not want to ridicule him, we wanted to do something respectful that Bergman would have been able to appreciate." ...|$|E
500|$|As a visibly distraught Rick hesitates {{to shoot}} Dale, Daryl takes {{the gun and}} inevitably shoots Dale in the head. Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{suggested}} that producers were subtly building up prior to the moment. Kirkman felt this marked Daryl's place in the group and was closure for the deceased Sophia Peletier, whose death caused Daryl {{to pull away from}} interacting with the group. Kirkman iterated that such actions were the testaments of his [...] "putting everything on the line and opening himself up in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> had never done before because his childhood was so messed up."; [...] "So when he found out she was dead and in the barn all the time, that's why he retreated and separated himself from the group. It was because he allowed himself to care and it just backfired on him in a big way. He didn't {{want to be a part}} of the group and have those emotions and care about these people. So he's been distancing himself from them up until this point, and now he's seeing that these people need him and that he can fill a role and in being that harsh distant guy, you can do the things that no one else wants to do. He wants to step in and take that burden away from Rick for a moment. Rick is the one who stepped up and shot Sophia. Daryl saw that and because of his pain over the loss of Sophia he couldn't do that. But when he sees Rick hesitate to do the same thing with Dale he knows: this is my moment, this is where I can prove my worth, and he steps in and does what he needs to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1939 {{a linear}} {{programming}} formulation {{of a problem}} that {{is equivalent to the}} general linear programming problem was given by the Soviet economist Leonid Kantorovich, who also proposed a method for solving it.

Kantorovich and Koopmans later shared the 1975 Nobel prize in economics.

Hooker also emphasises the influence of the Welsh mythological classic The Mabinogion on this novel, stating [...] "that the mythology is more essential, more integral, to this romance than its historical circumstances are".

If you look at his lyrics, he obviously was processing his pain and depression, and all of those things. I think that’s part of what people, myself included, responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there’s not too many people that have that many options with their voice.

Thanks to a molten motivational Rihanna chorus, it's pop-friendly as hell, without compromising Jay's fundamental hardness. And Jay is actually rapping like he cares, something he's only done intermittently {{over the last few}} years. Still, Kanye gets the hottest line on the song: 'What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' RAV 4?'" [...] Following the album's release, Pitchfork made another review of the song, again praising the track. [...] "There's something for everybody: Jay [...] sounds engaged in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> rarely has since unretiring, Rihanna coos those [...] "ay ay"s the radio loves, and Kanye West, as you may have read, once again upstages the guy he's producing.
