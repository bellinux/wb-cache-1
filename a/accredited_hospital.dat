We analyzed the Wrst 100 summaries of accreditation reports available on the website of the Agence Nationale d’Accréditation et d’Evaluation en Santé (ANAES). Data extraction. Data were collected on hospitals, accreditation processes, and outcomes (decisions of the FAC). For each decision, we assessed the relationship with accreditation manual criteria, and analyzed their distribution by chapter. Results of data synthesis. Among the 100 <b>accredited</b> <b>hospitals</b> (40 public, 43 private, 17 mixed), nine were accredited without recommendations for improvement, 47 with recommendations, 40 with reservations, and four with major reservations. All of them received requests for improvement. No signiWcant difference was found concerning the FAC decisions according to status and size of hospitals, although there was a trend that the larger the hospital, the more numerous and more serious the decisions of the FAC. The main topics addressed by decisions were those given high priority by the FAC (information given to patients and its traceability on patient records, and signing of prescriptions for medication).
