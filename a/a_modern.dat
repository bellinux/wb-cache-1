5|$|During World War I, a {{large number}} of pre-dreadnoughts {{remained}} in service.

The efficient cause is how a system moves and develops: to <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> biologist, those are explained by developmental biology and physiology. Biologists continue to offer explanations of these same kinds.|$|E
