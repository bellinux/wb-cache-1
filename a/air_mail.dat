5|$|Smith {{reported}} in his autobiography, during one run from Omaha to Cheyenne, {{that he had}} had to ditch into a pasture, landing on a cow. He sent a laconic telegram to his division supervisor at headquarters in College Park, Maryland, reporting the mishap. Crashes were part of the job. Engines were unreliable, and pilots were using road maps. Unpredictable, bad weather was a constant risk. In {{the first five years of}} US Post Office <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> service the average forced landing was every 800 miles and a pilot was killed about every 80,000 miles. Thirty-five pilots died during the Postal Service's operation of <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> flights; most deaths were between 1920 and 1925.|$|E
5|$|He drew two unusual {{assignments}} in 1934. When the USAAC took over flying the <b>air</b> <b>mail,</b> McClelland acted as zone communications officer at Salt Lake City.

5|$|Lympne Airport , was a {{military}} and later civil airfield , at Lympne, Kent, United Kingdom, which operated from 1916 to 1984. During the First World War RFC Lympne was originally an acceptance point for aircraft being delivered to, and returning from, France but was later designated as a First Class Landing Ground, RAF Lympne. It became a civil airfield in 1919 and saw the operation of early <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> services after the 1918 armistice.

5|$|On 1 April, Color Air won {{a two-year}} {{contract}} with Norway Post for all <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> from Oslo to Trondheim and Ålesund. On 10 April, Color Air started a weekly round trip each Saturday to Alicante Airport in Spain. On 12 April, Ove Johan Solem {{took over as}} CEO of Color Air. In May, the company increased the cabin load from 38 to 48%, with ridership increasing from 33,978 to 44,081. These numbers also included {{a change in the}} number of seats per plane. The following month, 46,777 people traveled with the airline. By the end of July, Color Air had lost NOK350 million. However, in July, Color Air had a cabin load exceeding 50%, the level Sunde had stated was necessary to make a profit.|$|E
5|$|Smith was {{instrumental}} in the inauguration of the <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> service by the United States Postal Service (USPS) in the summer of 1919. He had logged 900 hours of flying time in the Army before he joined the U.S. Mail Service at age nineteen. His first assignment was to fly mail from Omaha, Nebraska, to California, essentially following the same route as the Oregon Trail. His mother had taken this trail by covered wagon from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Cove, Oregon, in 1871. His mother and grandparents had taken two years to complete their trip, whereas Smith flew his route to California within a week with several stops along the way.|$|E

2500|$|Selznick {{realized}} that Oliver H.P. Garrett's original treatment was too heavily based on [...] "the ground" [...] {{and brought in}} John Monk Saunders, {{who had worked with}} him on The Dawn Patrol (1930), to add more flying scenes. Director Clarence Brown was dissatisfied with that version, so Selznick finally called on writer Wells Root to tighten up the final draft. Brown also was interested in an accurate portrayal of aviation, as he had been a World War I pilot. Night Flight utilized both studio and location shooting with the mountainous region around Denver, Colorado, filling in for the South American Andes. The recently retired U.S. Mail Douglas M-4 mail planes were featured as the Trans-Andean European <b>Air</b> <b>Mail's</b> primary aircraft.|$|R
5|$|The Imperial Gift {{aircraft}} {{formed the}} basis of the postwar Canadian Air Force (CAF), later the Royal Canadian Air Force. In 1920, the Canadian Air Board sponsored a project to conduct the first Trans-Canada flight to determine the feasibility of such flights for <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> and passenger services. Rivière du Loup to Winnipeg was flown by Leckie and Major Basil Hobbs in a Felixstowe F.3 and the remainder of the relay was completed using several of the CAF's DH-9As. All aircraft were part of the Imperial Gift. Although not considered suitable for the harsh Canadian weather, the Imperial Gift aircraft soldiered on into the 1930s; the last aircraft in service, an Avro 504K, was retired in 1934.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Lympne was {{designated}} a First Class Landing Ground and the Day and Night Bombing Observation School was formed here in May. The RFC and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) were merged {{to form the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) in April 1918. From 17 July 1919, No. 120 Squadron RAF flew <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> services between Lympne and Cologne, Germany, using de Havilland DH.9 aircraft fitted with Beardmore Halford Pullinger engines. This service ended on 1 September 1919 when 120 squadron moved to RAF Hawkinge. Hawkinge and Lympne lay within {{a few miles of}} each other and as the Air Ministry could not justify keeping the two bases open following the end of the war, they decided to retain Hawkinge. In August 1919 the RAF moved out of Lympne and it was turned over to civilian use, although 120 Squadron did not depart until 21 October.|$|E
5|$|In February 1920, a Notice to Airmen {{was issued}} advising pilots {{that had made}} {{emergency}} landings at Penshurst that they could use the War Office telephone to inform the police of their arrival and to obtain conveyances for their passengers {{to take them to}} Penshurst station. On 5 June 1920, the first <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> flight between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom was made. Bert Hinchcliffe departed from Schiphol in a hired Airco DH.9 with 300 letters on board. Despite the bad weather, Hinchcliffe decided not to land at Lympne and pressed on towards Croydon. He was eventually forced to land at Penshurst due to a combination of the weather and running low on fuel. A taxi was hired to take Hinchcliffe and the letters on to London. A linen windsock was installed at Penshurst in November 1920. The War Office telephone was notified as having been discontinued in January 1921. On 24 September 1921, a de Havilland DH.18 aircraft diverted to Penshurst as Croydon was fogbound.|$|E

50|$|On shortwave a third station {{operated}} a sponsored religious broadcasting station {{under the name}} of WMR—World Mission Radio with an over the <b>air</b> <b>mailing</b> address in California, United States. Because of its American address, this station triggered international complaints to the US FCC during 1988 and 1989. The FCC was at that time engaged in legal casework over Radio Newyork International, whose founder had previously been aboard the MV Ross Revenge helping to set up an earlier shortwave radio channel. In defence of its case for Radio Newyork International lawyers had submitted briefs to the US District Court citing the examples of Radio Caroline and the Voice of Peace as offshore broadcasting stations that had been left alone unchallenged by governmental interference. On August 19, 1989, Dutch authorities with British assistance, raided the MV Ross Revenge and shut down all transmissions.|$|R
25|$|Commercial <b>Air</b> <b>Mail</b> service {{commenced}} in the United Kingdom in 1919. By {{the early}} 1930s Imperial Airways was operating regular airmail services to Europe and the British colonies and dominions. To facilitate easy collection of <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> and its speedy onward transmission, {{a fleet of}} special vehicles and dedicated postboxes were introduced. To distinguish them from regular post boxes, they were painted Air Force blue, with prominent royal blue signage. The service ran successfully until the outbreak of war in 1939, when it was suspended. Although <b>Air</b> <b>Mail</b> re-commenced after the War, the postboxes and vehicles were no longer identifiable, as <b>Air</b> <b>Mail</b> could now be posted anywhere.|$|E
25|$|After an {{intermittent}} {{series of}} government sponsored experimental flights between 1911 and 1918, domestic U.S. <b>Air</b> <b>Mail</b> was formally {{established as a}} new class of service by the Post Office Department on May 15, 1918, with the inauguration of the Washington–Philadelphia–New York route for which the first of special <b>Air</b> <b>Mail</b> stamps were issued.|$|E

40|$|This paper reports field {{results of}} E-PERMS in both (lie S-Chamber and their keeper caps.

Data has been grouped to show precision (co-located tests), accuracy (radon chamber results), and electret stability. The latter results were also broken down into S-Chamber versus keeper cap versus electret series. Besides the aforementioned, a major emphasis will be comparing on-site E-PERM data versus those E-PERMS mailed overnight throughout the country. Overall the data showed that the E-PERMS are accurate and very precise. However, with regard to electret stability, older series and physically older electrets within a series appear to be somewhat more stable or less sensitive than newer electrets. Nevertheless, there is no difference when comparing the results of E-PERMS measured on site versus those <b>air</b> <b>mailed</b> back and forth to the same analysis lab for measurement...|$|R
