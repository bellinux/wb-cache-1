5|$|The {{locations}} in the film are separated visually from the shots of Madonna, who is singing in a darkened studio. Unlike her previous videos, Madonna portrays <b>a</b> <b>narrator,</b> whose song comments on the story, appearing in shots completely different from the narrative action. She appears {{to speak for the}} character, addressing his problems directly, like the chorus of a classical tragedy.|$|E
5|$|The poem was {{the first}} of Eliot's that relied on speech, with <b>a</b> <b>narrator</b> who speaks to the {{audience}} directly. Described as a poem of early summer, air, and grace, it begins with <b>a</b> <b>narrator</b> recalling a moment in a garden. The scene provokes a discussion on time and how the present, not the future or past, really matters to individuals. Memories connect the individual to the past, but the past cannot change. The poem then transitions from memory to how life works and the point of existence. In particular, the universe is described as orderly and that consciousness is not found within time even though humanity is bound by time. The scene of the poem moves from a garden to the London underground where technology dominates. Those who cling to technology and reason are unable to understand the universe or the Logos ("the Word", or Christ). The underworld is replaced by a churchyard and a discussion of death. This, in turn, becomes a discussion of timelessness and eternity, which ends the poem.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>narrator</b> {{explains}} how humans were unaware that {{a race of}} extraterrestrials was making plans to occupy Earth. Ray Ferrier is a divorced crane operator longshoreman {{who works at a}} dock in Brooklyn, New York and lives in Bayonne, New Jersey. Ray is estranged from his children. His former wife, Mary Ann, later drops off the children, 10-year-old daughter Rachel and teenage son Robbie, at Ray's house on her way to visit her parents in Boston. Unexplained changes in the weather occur, including lightning that strikes multiple times {{in the middle of an}} intersection and disrupts all electricity.|$|E

5|$|In June 2010, Anurag Basu {{confirmed}} that his film would feature three lead roles, a deaf and mute man, a mentally challenged girl, and <b>a</b> <b>narrator.</b> With former titles like Khamoshi or Silence, media reports said {{the story was}} grim or dark. However, Basu stated that on the contrary, the film was happy. According to Basu, he paid homage to Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin by adding scenes inspired by the era of silent cinema and using physical comedy in the film, involving silent portions.|$|E
5|$|To avoid <b>a</b> <b>narrator,</b> {{the serial}} delegates the novel's first ironic {{sentence}} to Elizabeth {{in an early}} scene. The adaptation opens {{with a view of}} Darcy's and Bingley's horses as they race across a field toward the Netherfield estate, expressing vitality; Elizabeth watches them before breaking into a run. While the novel indicates Elizabeth's independence and energy in her three-mile trek to Netherfield, the adaptation of this scene also shows her rebelliousness and love of nature.|$|E
5|$|Gielgud, {{a member}} of the {{theatrical}} dynasty the Terry family, began working on stage in 1921 before attending the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. After completing his studies he worked in repertory theatre and in the West End before establishing himself at the Old Vic in the 1930s. He continued working on the stage until 1990 both as a director and actor. Although he made some films early in his career, he did not start working regularly in the medium until he was in his sixties; in the course of just over thirty years between 1964 and 1998 he appeared in over sixty films. He was active on television and radio, appearing in numerous plays and interviews, and was also in demand as <b>a</b> <b>narrator.</b>|$|E

5|$|The poem {{ends with}} the narrator turning towards his own fate, {{accepting}} his life and accomplishments. The poem, like many of Gray's, incorporates <b>a</b> <b>narrator</b> who is contemplating his position in a transient world that is mysterious and tragic. Although the comparison between obscurity and renown is commonly seen as universal and not within a specific context with a specific political message, there are political ramifications for Gray's choices. Both John Milton and John Hampden spent time near the setting of Stoke Poges, which was also affected by the English Civil War. The poem's composition could also have been prompted by the entrance of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland into London or by a trial of Jacobite nobility in 1746.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Kyle, Stan and Kenny watch America's Stupidest Home Videos; {{they hear}} there's a $10,000 grand prize for the stupidest home video. They decide {{to enter the}} {{competition}} with the video they made of Cartman. Cartman approaches Kyle and Stan (Kenny was dragged to a train track by Stan's go-cart and killed by an oncoming train) with the depressing news about his lack of funds to find out his real father. Stan and Kyle agree that if they win the video contest they will give Cartman the $3,000 needed for the DNA testing. Cartman is overjoyed, but quickly becomes extremely angry after seeing the aired video. Though they do not win the competition, as Stan's grandfather wins with a videotape he made of Kenny's death, they receive a $3,000 runner-up prize instead, which is still enough for the DNA test. Dr. Mephesto calls together Cartman, his mother and all potential fathers (including the 1989 Denver Broncos), when he gets the test results which is where Kenny comes back to life. When {{he is about to}} reveal the identity of Cartman's father, <b>a</b> <b>narrator</b> states that the answer will be revealed in the new South Park episode four weeks later, much to Cartman's annoyance and anger.|$|E
