The objective of this work {{was to assess the}} range of physiological <b>adaptative</b> <b>responses</b> involved in tolerance of ammonium nutrition at the intra-specific level. Pisum sativum L. was selected as a model of tolerance for the study, and four varieties of agricultural importance (Snap-pea, Rondo, Tristar and Eclipse) were grown hydroponically withammoniumor nitrate (0. 5, 2. 5, 5. 0 and 10. 0 mM) as the sole nitrogen source. Physiological parameters including photosynthesis, respiration and ammonium contents were analyzed. Activities/expression of key enzymes of the nitrogen metabolism was also determined, for which novel antibodies against glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase were obtained. Snap-pea was considered a reference plant for ammonium tolerance, since its biomass accumulation was not affected by nitrogen source. It avoided the physiological effects of ammonium through low growth potential, high respiratory rates and activity of the alternative pathway. A multivariate analysis of the results showed that each of the four varieties had distinct <b>adaptative</b> <b>responses</b> to ammonium nutrition, highlighting the flexibility of response to ammonium nutrition at the species level.

Here we show that the E 3 ubiquitin ligase and co-chaperone Carboxyl Terminus HSP 70 / 90 Interacting Protein (CHIP) prevents neuron death in the hippocampus induced by severe ER stress. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) were exposed to Tunicamycin, a pharmacological ER stress inducer, to trigger cell death. Overexpression of CHIP was achieved with a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV) and significantly diminished ER stress-induced cell death, as shown by analysis of propidium iodide (PI) uptake, condensed chromatin, TUNEL and cleaved caspase 3 in the CA 1 region of OHSCs. In addition, overexpression of CHIP prevented upregulation of both CHOP and p 53 both pro-apoptotic pathways induced by ER stress. We also detected an attenuation of eIF 2 a phosphorylation promoted by ER stress. However, CHIP did not prevent upregulation of BiP/GRP 78 induced by UPR.

Adult female mice were divided into two groups fed with i) high fat (HF) diet and ii) standard chow (SC) diet, during pregnancy and lactation. HF mothers showed a significant weight gain, higher levels of blood glucose and an abnormal glucose tolerance compared to SC mother, indicating the establishment of metabolic syndrome. Then, offspring subdivided according to maternal diet, O-SC pups birthed from mothers fed SC, whereas O-HF pups birthed from mothers fed HF diet, and morphological and functional experiments were performed in the small intestine 2 developmental ages, early suckling (P 2) and late suckling (P 15) to evaluate the contribute of maternal milk in the development of obesity. O-HF at P 2 and P 15 did not show significant changes in the morphology of the small intestinal wall (villus height, depth of the crypt, villus width near the crypt and thickness of the muscular layer) compared to O-SC. Moreover in agreement with morphological data, no difference has been found in the amplitude and frequency of the intestinal spontaneous mechanical activity from O-HF compared to O-SC. The contractile and relaxant responses to well know drugs as the muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol, and the b-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, were similar in both groups of animal.

The aim of this study was to investigate the global cellular consequences of P 450 2 C 9 overexpression at the transcriptional level using an untargeted approach: pangenomic microarrays. Recombinant adenovirus was used to express P 450 2 C 9 instead of an inducer to prevent a per se effect of inducer or its metabolites. P 450 2 C 9 overexpression induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and regulated genes implicated in the unfolded protein response (UPR) as heat shock protein (HSP) (we studied particurlarly HSPA 5 and HSPB 1) and in the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) system as Sec 61 and ubiquitin and proteasome pathways. UPR and ERAD are two mechanisms of <b>adaptative</b> <b>response</b> to ER stress. Moreover, activation of Akt was observed in HepG 2 cells that overexpress P 450 2 C 9 and might participate in the cellular adaptive response to stress, thus leading to the activation of cell survival pathways.

40|$|Tropisms {{represent}} fascinating {{examples of}} how plants respond to environmental signals by adapting their growth and development. Here, a novel tropism is reported, halotropism, allowing plant seedlings to reduce their exposure to salinity by circumventing a saline environment. In response to a salt gradient, Arabidopsis, tomato, and sorghum roots were found to actively prioritize growth away from salinity above following the gravity axis. Directionality of this response is established by an active redistribution of the plant hormone auxin in the root tip, which is mediated by the PIN-FORMED 2 (PIN 2) auxin efflux carrier. We show that salt-induced phospholipase D activity stimulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis of PIN 2 {{at the side of}} the root facing the higher salt concentration. The intracellular relocalization of PIN 2 allows for auxin redistribution and for the directional bending of the root away from the higher salt concentration.

40|$|There is a {{considerable}} public and scientific debate concerning welfare of fish in aquaculture. In this review, we will consider fish welfare as an integration of physiological, behavioral, and cognitive/emotional responses, {{all of which are}} essentially <b>adaptative</b> <b>responses</b> to stressful situations. An overview of fish welfare in this context suggests that understanding will rely on knowledge of all components of allostatic responses to stress and environmental perturbations. The development of genomic technologies provides new approaches to this task, exemplified by how genome-wide analysis of genetic structures and corresponding expression patterns can lead to the discovery of new aspects of <b>adaptative</b> <b>responses.</b> We will illustrate how the genomic approach may give rise to new biomarkers for fish welfare and also increase our understanding of the interaction between physiological, behavioral, and emotional responses. In a first part, we present data on expression of candidate genes selected a priori. This is a common avenue to develop molecular biomarkers capable of diagnosing a stress condition at its earliest onset, in order to allow quick corrective intervention in an aquaculture setting. However, most of these studies address isolated physiological functions and stress responses that may not be truly indicative of animal welfare, and there is only rudimentary understanding of genes related to possible cognitive and emotional responses in fish. We also present an overview on transcriptomic analysis related to the effect of aquaculture stressors, environmental changes (temperature, salinity, hypoxia), or concerning specific behavioral patterns. These studies illustrate the potential of genomic approaches to characterize the complexity of the molecular mechanisms which underlies not only physiological but also behavioral responses in relation to fish welfare. Thirdly, we address proteomic studies on biological responses to stressors such as salinity change and hypoxia. We will also consider proteomic studies developed in mammals in relation to anxiety and depressive status which may lead to new potential candidates in fish. Finally, in the conclusion, we will suggest new developments to facilitate an integrated view of fish welfare. This includes use of laser microdissection in the transcriptomic/proteomic studies, development of meta-analysis methods for extracting information from genomic data sets, and implementation of technological advances for high-throughput proteomic studies. Development of these new approaches should be as productive for our understanding of the biological processes underlying fish welfare as it has been for the progress of pathophysiological research...|$|R

We investigated in rats {{the effects of}} DFO on the ventilatory response to mild hypoxic tests and the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a target gene of HIF- 1.

40|$|International audienceHeparanase is an endo-beta-d-glucuronidase which {{specifically}} cleaves extracellular {{and cell}} surface heparan sulphates at intra-chain sites. Its enzymatic activity is strongly implicated in cell dissemination associated with tumor metastasis and inflammation. Indeed, heparanase gene {{is expressed in}} various tumors and its over-expression is correlated with increased tumor vascularity and metastatic potential of tumor cells. However, heparanase expression in non-invasive and non-immune tissue, including brain, has received less attention. Using RT-qPCR, western blot and histological analysis, we demonstrate in the adult rat that heparanase transcript is differentially expressed according to brain area, and that heparanase protein is mainly detected in neurons. Furthermore, we provide evidence that heparanase transcript and protein reach their greatest levels at early postnatal stages, in particular within the neocortex characterized by intensive structural plasticity. Using the in vitro model of PC 12 -induced neuronal differentiation, we suggest that developmental regulation of heparanase may coincide with axonal and dendritic pathfinding. At adulthood, we demonstrate that the increased heparanase transcript level correlates in the hippocampus with enhanced angiogenesis following repeated hypoxia exposures. Taken together, our results emphasize the potential importance of heparanase in brain homeostasis, both during development and <b>adaptative</b> <b>responses</b> to severe environmental challenges...|$|R
