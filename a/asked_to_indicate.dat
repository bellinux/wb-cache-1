5|$|According to the Bureau of Immigration, 54,057 Armenians {{entered the}} US between 1899 and 1917. The top listed {{countries}} of origin were Turkey (46,474), Russia (3,034), Canada (1,577), Great Britain (914) and Egypt (894). Immigrants were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> which state {{they were going to}} settle in; for Armenians, the most popular answers were New York (17,391), Massachusetts (14,192), Rhode Island (4,923), Illinois (3,313), California (2,564), New Jersey (2,115), Pennsylvania (2,002), Michigan (1,371). The largest Armenian American communities at that time were located in New York City; Fresno; Worcester, Massachusetts; Boston; Philadelphia; Chicago; Jersey City; Detroit; Los Angeles; Troy, New York; and Cleveland.|$|E
25|$|The Survey of Perceived Organizational Support was {{originally}} constructed with 32 items.

25|$|A dowser {{claimed that}} he could detect water, even in a bottle inside a sealed {{cardboard}} box. He was shown twenty boxes and he was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> which boxes contained a water bottle. He selected eight of the boxes which he said contained water. Actually, only five of the twenty contained water. Of the eight selected boxes, only one was revealed to contain water and one contained sand. It was not revealed whether any of the remaining six boxes contained water.|$|E

30|$|Another {{variable}} {{is also used}} to show the impact of using Internet on the growth of firms’ sales (inter). For this reason, one possibility is <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> firms <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> whether their sales have changed after using the internet. More precisely, an ordered dichotomic {{variable is}} used to show whether sales have increased, decreased or stabilized after using Internet as a marketing tool.|$|R
25|$|Survivor Valeen Schnurr {{claims that}} she was the one {{questioned}} as to her belief in God by Harris. Joshua Lapp thought Bernall had been queried about her belief, but was unable to correctly point out where Bernall was located, and was closer to Schnurr during the shootings. Another witness, Craig Scott, whose sister Rachel Scott was also portrayed as a Christian martyr, claimed that the discussion was with Bernall. When <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> where the conversation had been coming from, he pointed to where Schnurr was shot.|$|E
25|$|This task is {{designed}} to measure spatial memory abilities in children. The experimenter asks the participant to visualize a blank matrix with a little man. Through a series of directional instructions such as forwards, backwards, left or right, the experimenter guides the participant's little man on a pathway throughout the matrix. At the end, the participant is <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> on a real matrix where the little man {{that he or she}} visualized finished. The length of the pathway varies depending on the level of difficulty (1-10) and the matrices themselves may vary in length from 2 x 2 cells to 6 x 6.|$|E
25|$|A related finding {{regarding}} statistical cues to phonological acquisition is {{a phenomenon}} known as the perceptual magnet effect. In this effect, a prototypical phoneme of a person’s native language acts as a “magnet” for similar phonemes, which are perceived as belonging to {{the same category as}} the prototypical phoneme. In the original test of this effect, adult participants were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> if a given exemplar of a particular phoneme differed from a referent phoneme. If the referent phoneme is a non-prototypical phoneme for that language, both adults and 6-month-old infants show less generalization to other sounds than they do for prototypical phonemes, even if the subjective distance between the sounds is the same. That is, adults and infants are both more likely to notice that a particular phoneme differs from the referent phoneme if that referent phoneme is a non-prototypical exemplar than if it is a prototypical exemplar. The prototypes themselves are apparently discovered through a distributional learning process, in which infants are sensitive to the frequencies with which certain sounds occur and treat those that occur most often as the prototypical phonemes of their language.|$|E

30|$|A {{prospective}} cross-sectional {{survey was}} conducted amongst radiology practitioners and radiographers working at a primary paediatric referral centre in Malta. Part of the survey <b>asked</b> participants <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> the typical effective dose (ED) for several commonly performed paediatric imaging examinations, answer five true-false statements about radiation protection principles, and specify their use of referral guidelines for paediatric imaging.|$|R
25|$|To {{distinguish}} {{between these two}} possibilities, Trueswell et al. {{conducted a series of}} experiments similar to those conducted by Yu and Smith except that participants were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> their choice of the word-referent mapping on each trial, and only a single object name was presented on each trial (with varying numbers of objects). Participants would therefore have been at chance when they are forced to make a choice in their first trial. The results from the subsequent trials indicate that participants were not using a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, but instead were using a propose-and-verify mechanism, holding only one potential hypothesis in mind at a time. Specifically, if participants had chosen an incorrect word-referent mapping in an initial presentation of a nonsense word (from a display of five possible choices), their likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping in the next trial of that word was still at chance, or 20%. If, though, the participant had chosen the correct word-referent mapping on an initial presentation of a nonsense word, the likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping on the subsequent presentation of that word was approximately 50%. These results were also replicated in a condition where participants were choosing between only two alternatives. These results suggest that participants did not remember the surrounding context of individual presentations and were therefore not using statistical cues to determine the word-referent mappings. Instead, participants make a hypothesis regarding a word-referent mapping and, on the next presentation of that word, either confirm or reject the hypothesis accordingly.|$|E

500|$|One {{group of}} people {{were told that the}} person was warm and another {{group of people}} were told the person is [...] "cold". Participants were asked to write a brief {{description}} of the impression they formed after hearing these characteristics. The experimenters also produced a check list consisting of pairs of opposite traits, such as generous/ungenerous, shrewd/wise, etc. These words were related to the first list of characteristics they heard. Participants were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> which of these traits matched with the hypothetical person who had just been described to them.|$|E
50|$|In {{an effort}} to {{determine}} which stage partners are in, Welch and Rubin (2002) gave partners a list of behaviors and <b>asked</b> them <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> the extent <b>to</b> which each behavior was characteristic of their relationship.

30|$|In Experiment 1, we <b>asked</b> {{participants}} <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> {{the moment}} at which they began to experience an illusion. Questionnaire responses reflected that participants were able {{to distinguish between the}} experience of ownership and that of disownership, and that these responses correlated with their online recording of OT. Accordingly, we surmised that the OT measure can also be employed to distinguish between these two experiences when participants are aware of what type of illusion to expect. To verify this, for Experiment 2 we <b>asked</b> participants <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> the instant when they began to experience ownership of the rubber hand, as well as the instant they began to experience disownership of the biological hand. We predicted that, if the disownership view holds true: (1) OTs for both ownership and disownership would be earlier under the synchronous than the asynchronous condition; (2) ownership and disownership OTs would correlate; and (3) ownership–disownership ratings would correlate with ownership–disownership OTs.|$|R
