However, Southampton lost 3–2 to Manchester United in the final on 26 February 2017. Forster had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>match</b> in Southampton's scoreless draw with Liverpool at Anfield on 7 May 2017; saving James Milner's 65th minute penalty kick, and then pushing Marko Grujic's header over the crossbar in injury time.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA novel {{reconfigurable}} patch {{array antenna}} {{associated with a}} wall of plasma tubes is proposed at 2. 45 GHz. A parametric study is done for {{the distance between the}} patch array and the plasma wall in order to find what distance gives <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>matching</b> at the operating frequency for all the configurations. The performance of the reconfigurable system is observed in terms of S 11, maximum realized gain, radiation patterns by simulation and measurement. It is shown that by switching ON or OFF the fluorescent lamps, we can change the beamwidth of radiation pattern. In reconfigurable printed active arrays, the main difficulty is to keep <b>good</b> <b>matching</b> for all configurations (switch ON or OFF).

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>match</b> between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Jean-Paul-François de Noailles, Duc d'Ayen {{was looking}} to marry off some of his five daughters. The young Lafayette, aged 14, seemed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>match</b> for his 12-year-old daughter, Marie Adrienne Françoise, and the duc spoke to the boy's {{guardian}} (Lafayette's uncle, the new comte) to negotiate a deal. However, the arranged marriage was opposed by the duc's wife, who felt the couple, and especially her daughter, were too young. The matter was settled by agreeing {{not to mention the}} marriage plans for two years, during which time the two spouses-to-be would meet {{from time to time in}} casual settings and get to know each other better. The scheme worked; the two fell in love, and were happy together from the time of their marriage in 1774 until her death in 1807.|$|E
5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>match</b> and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E

5|$|Sabrina {{asked her}} friends {{not to discuss}} her past as she {{believed}} her humble beginnings, and Day's mistreatment of her, would tarnish her reputation. Anna Seward nevertheless wrote about Sabrina's upbringing in her 1804 work Memoirs on the Life of Dr. Darwin. As Seward publicly identified Sabrina in the book, it was criticised by the press, and Sabrina's son John was very angry to learn of his mother's past. In his 1820 memoirs, Edgeworth stated his belief that Sabrina and Day made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>match</b> and that she loved him.

Mohamad describes her as being fatalistic and notes that she downplays her past by saying that any of a thousand girls in Tanjung Priok could tell the same story; he found her touching without being melodramatic, and notes that Yah was the first prostitute featured portrayed sympathetically in an Indonesian work.|$|E

Their last son, William, was born on 10 July 1723, five months after Charles' death in February.|$|E
5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>match</b> to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E
