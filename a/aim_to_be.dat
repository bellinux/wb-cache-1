25|$|Passive noise {{isolation}} is essentially using {{the body of}} the earphone, either over or in the ear, as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound. The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural. Open-back and earbud headphones provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others. Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15dB. Some models have been specifically designed for drummers, with the <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to monitor the recorded sound while shutting out the sound coming directly from the drums {{at the same time as}} much as possible. Such headphones claim to reduce ambient noise by around 25dB.|$|E
25|$|Chessick also {{acknowledged}} {{the dangers of}} relativism implicit in ontological hermeneutics. He acknowledges that the art and theory of interpretation is not bound by today's methods of science that aim to prevent nihilism and relativism. However, Bernstein {{has pointed out that}} there never could be any hard and fast rules or methods for interpretation because it does not <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a science. Gadamer states that the methods of the natural sciences are too impoverished to reveal many truths about human nature and likewise advocated for a hermeneutic approach. Others have made similar arguments for ontological hermeneutics. Chessick writes that the limitations preventing the natural sciences from uncovering certain truths about human nature is precisely why Dilthey initially advocated for a distinction between the natural and human sciences, paving the way for hermeneutics to become a method of inquiry.|$|E

Despite strong rumors sending him to team U.S. Postal Service, Ivan Basso moved to Team CSC for the 2004 season, under guidance of team manager Bjarne Riis.

25|$|As President, Erdoğan has overseen {{a revival}} of Ottoman tradition, {{greeting}} Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas with an Ottoman-style ceremony in the new presidential palace, with guards dressed in costumes representing founders of 16 Great Turkish Empires in history. While serving as the Prime Minister of Turkey, Erdoğan's AKP made references to the Ottoman era during election campaigns, such as calling their supporters 'grandsons of Ottomans' (Osmanlı torunu). This proved controversial, since it was perceived to be an open attack against the republican nature of modern Turkey founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. In 2015, Erdoğan made a statement in which he endorsed the old Ottoman term külliye to refer to university campuses rather than the standard Turkish word kampüs. Many critics have thus accused Erdoğan of wanting to become an Ottoman sultan and abandon the secular and democratic credentials of the Republic. When pressed on this issue in January 2015, Erdoğan denied these claims {{and said that he}} would <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more like Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom rather than like an Ottoman sultan.|$|E
25|$|Following on from this, Angel {{headlines}} {{the series}} Angel and Faith, primarily set in London. Its stories <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> respectful to the storylines featured in IDW's forty-four issue Angel run, and maintains {{a very tight}} continuity with Buffy Season Nine and other related comics. In his series, Angel faces the looming threat of his now unstable former mentor Whistler, who helped bring about his transformation into Twilight, {{as well as his}} two dangerous former acolytes, half-demons Pearl and Nash, in addition a group of British Slayers who cannot forgive his actions as Twilight. Along with Faith, he lives in Giles' London apartment where they are joined by Giles' ageless aunts, witches Lavinia and Sophronia. Angel intends to honor Giles' memory, and seeks to collect fragments of Giles' soul from magical items as part of a plan to resurrect him. In the series' conclusion, Giles is successfully resurrected, albeit as a young teenage boy, and the gang pursue Whistler, Pearl and Nash to a rooftop, where they plan to unleash a horrific magical plague on the world as an inelegant means to restore magic to the universe. Nash is killed, and Angel is able to persuade Whistler to see the error of his ways, successfully limiting to the extent of the plague to an area of Hackney in London. In the season's denouement, Faith returns to America alongside Giles, while Angel remains behind to guard over the plagued neighborhood, now called Magic Town, where residentsmagically mutated into all manner of creatureare already causing problems.|$|E

Chocolate fondue with marshmallows and waffles are among the options for dessert as well as a knickerbocker glory. Traditional fine dining dishes are also included on the menu, such as Sevruga caviar. Ramsay said in interviews around the launch of the restaurant that he aimed to keep [...] "it all very lean, lean, lean. No heavy sauces".

500|$|Among his {{contemporary}} peers, Messi is {{most often}} compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, {{as part of an}} ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Björn Borg–John McEnroe rivalry in tennis, and the Ayrton Senna–Alain Prost rivalry from Formula One. Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry, they are widely believed to push one another in their <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the best player in the}} world: since 2008, Ronaldo has won four Ballons d'Or to Messi's five, and four European Golden Shoes to Messi's three. Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players; beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques—Ronaldo is [...] with a muscular build—and contrasting public personalities, with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility. Messi faces Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events.
