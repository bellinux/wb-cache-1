25|$|The process uses a {{salt bath}} of alkali cyanate. This is {{contained}} in a steel pot that has an <b>aeration</b> <b>system.</b> The cyanate thermally reacts with {{the surface of the}} workpiece to form alkali carbonate. The bath is then treated to convert the carbonate back to a cyanate. The surface formed from the reaction has a compound layer and a diffusion layer. The compound layer consists of iron, nitrogen, and oxygen, is abrasion resistant, and stable at elevated temperatures. The diffusion layer contains nitrides and carbides. The surface hardness ranges from 800 to 1500 HV depending on the steel grade. This also inversely affects the depth of the case; i.e. a high carbon steel will form a hard, but shallow case.|$|E
500|$|Armillaria luteobubalina uses [...] "an elaborate, {{sophisticated}} aeration system" [...] {{that enables}} it to efficiently deliver oxygen into the rhizomorphs, helping it thrive in low-oxygen environments. When grown in culture, the mycelium develops into a continuous region of tissue with a perforated crust. This tissue is hydrophobic and resistant to becoming waterlogged. Rhizomorphs develop beneath clusters of so-called [...] "air-pores" [...] near the perforations. These gas spaces connect the atmosphere {{with the central}} canal of the rhizomorph, to facilitate diffusion of oxygen and satiate the organism's high oxygen requirement during growth. This <b>aeration</b> <b>system</b> {{is thought to be}} an important factor in the organism's pathogenicity, allowing it to grow on wet or waterlogged root surfaces and send hyphae or rhizomorphs into live roots or cut stumps, where conditions may be hypoxic. The rhizomorphs have a dichotomous branching pattern, so that they split or bifurcate at various intervals. Experiments and field observations have shown that this allows the fungus to be a more aggressive and virulent pathogen than Armillaria species whose rhizomorphs branch monopodially (where lateral branches grow from a main stem). Although the structure of A.luteobubalina rhizomorphs is specialised for spread in potentially anaerobic conditions, the soil mycelium is adaptive and can amplify the absorptive surface of peripheral hyphae in response to the presence of nutrient-rich soil.|$|E

This study describes the results of pilot-scale fine-pore aeration testing to determine a-values and influencing factors for MBRs. Clean water and process water aeration tests were performed at the Honouliuli WWTP during the period of December 2005 and October 2006. Three different 9 -inch diameter fine-pore diffusers were tested. Comprehensive analyses of the sludge properties were conducted. Through this study, correlations were found to exist between a-value and oxygen uptake rate (OUR), particle size distribution (PSD), MLSS and viscosity of activated sludge, thereby providing better understanding and design guidance for MBR <b>aeration</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|The oxygen {{transfer}} {{rate and the}} corresponding power requirement to operate the rotor are vital for design and scale-up of surface aerators. The aeration process can be analyzed in two ways such as batch and continuous systems. The process behaviors of batch and continuous flow systems are different from each other. The experimental and numerical results obtained through the batch systems cannot be relied on and applied for the designing of the continuous aeration tank. Based on the experimentation on batch and continuous type systems, the present work compares the performance of both the batch and continuous surface <b>aeration</b> <b>systems</b> {{in terms of their}} {{oxygen transfer}} capacity and power consumption. A simulation equation developed through experimentation has shown that continuous flow surface <b>aeration</b> <b>systems</b> are taking more energy than the batch systems.

40|$|Resolution of the {{aeration}} {{requirements of}} Brucella suis in broth culture was imperative {{for the production}} of the comparatively large amounts of cells re-quired in the extensive epidemiological and immunological project of which this study is a part. The two prime factors in sparger aeration appeared to be (1) the rate of air supply and (2) the type of sparger employed; the two factors apparently were interdependent. Thus, the more efficient the sparger in pro-ducing fine bubbles, in general the less air required for growth. This has been emphasized in a review of biological <b>aeration</b> <b>systems</b> by De Becge and Liebmann (1944). In the case of this organism, however, the kinds of antifoam employed with various sparger <b>aeration</b> <b>systems</b> has also been found to be of primary importance. A typical industrial type stainless steel "dishpan " sparger has 0. 108 -inch perforations, 49 per square inch; whereas, in contrast, one of the more efficient industrial type heat-resistant carbon spargers (grade no. 60) has an average porosity of 0. 0013 inches.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{management}} practice for grains and legumes {{is the use}} of <b>aeration</b> <b>systems.</b> Air is pushed through the storage bins at low flow rates, which removes excess moisture and heat. Regulation of air flow allows the moisture content in harvested products to remain at a constant level and decreases the temperature within the bins. Temperature levels can decrease enough so insects and mites are dormant, which reduces rapid growth of the pathogen.|$|R

40|$|Aeration {{accounts}} for 30 % to 75 % {{of the total}} energy consumption in activated sludge processes (ASPs). This percentage can be significantly reduced since most <b>aeration</b> <b>systems</b> are not optimized for unsteady influent flow rates and oxygen requirements.

These measures increase the operational lifetime of the aeration equipment and improve effluent and activated sludge quality. This article provides a review of two critical nonlinear time-varying parameters that characterize the DO concentration dynamics in an ASP: the oxygen uptake rate (OUR), related to microorganism activity, and the volumetric oxygen mass transfer function, represented by the oxygen transfer rate (OTR). Second, the physico-chemical, geometric, and dynamic factors and aerator type affecting the oxygen mass transfer coefficient (K (L) a) are thoroughly discussed. The article concludes with model-based optimization, explaining the usefulness of accurate DO models in wastewater treatment, and provides examples for plant-wide or water chain cycle-focused optimizations...|$|R
40|$|Aeration {{technology}} is applied {{in hundreds of}} Minnesota lakes and reservoirs {{for at least three}} purposes: (a) to prevent winterkill of fish in shallow lakes under ice cover, (b) to reduce nutrient release rates from the sediments and (c) in aquaculture to provide aerated water to high-density fish populations. A major uncertainty in the design, selection and application of <b>aeration</b> <b>systems</b> is the often observed increase in oxygen demand after <b>aeration</b> <b>systems</b> are installed and operated. As a result, the improvement in dissolved oxygen is often less than anticipated, even zero. In this study we have investigated this problem through a series of carefully designed experiments. We have shown that sedimentary oxygen demand (SOD), frequently the major oxygen consumer in lakes, increases proportionally to the velocity with which the water above the sediments moves. Aeration devices often and intentionally increase water velocity above the sediments and thereby increase oxygen consumption in the lake. The results given in this report allow a more realistic estimation of oxygen demand in lakes for aerator selection. Recommendations for aerator placement are also given.
