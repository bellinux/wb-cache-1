40|$|The {{problem of}} source {{identification}} involves correctly classifying an incoming signal into a category that identifies the signal's source. The problem {{is difficult because}} information is not provided concerning each source's distinguishing characteristics and because successive signals from the same source differ. The source identification problem can be made more difficult by dynamically changing the repertoire of sources while the problem is being solved. We used genetic programming to evolve both the topology and the sizing (numerical values) for each component of an analog electrical circuit that can correctly classify an incoming <b>analog</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> into three categories. Then, the repertoire of sources was dynamically changed by adding a new source during the run.

40|$|The vibraphone (sometimes {{referred}} to as a vibraharp) is an instrument popular primarily in the jazz community. It is classified in the struck idiophone subfamily of the percussion instruments, meaning that it is struck {{in such a way that}} it produces its sound through vibration.

The sound of striking the bars is amplified through resonators underneath each bar, similar to the amplification of an organ. There are also motor driven butterfly valves within these resonators that when turned on can produce a vibrato or tremolo effect. The vibraphone also features a sustain pedal similar to that of a piano. For my project, I designed and assembled an electronic vibraphone.

40|$|An {{automated}} electro-pneumatic {{soil sampling}} method based on pressurized air for real-time soil analysis {{was developed and}} tested under laboratory conditions. Pressurized air was applied for 36 ms across a 2. 5 cm diameter cylinder to cut a sample from a soil column and convey the sample along a delivery pipe into a container. An electro-pneumatic regulator valve was used to regulate the air pressure at 550, 690, and 830 kPa (80, 100, and 120 psi) using an <b>analog</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>signal.</b> A two-position solenoid valve controlled by a stand-alone microprocessor was used to control pulse duration. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the effectiveness of positive high-pressure air as a cutting force for different soil conditions. The effects of air pressure level, soil moisture content, soil compaction, and soil type on the quantity of soil sample obtained were investigated. Moisture content and air pressure level were the most significant factors, while compaction was not significant (. = 0. 05) in terms of mass of soil obtained. Laboratory test results proved that pressurized air was effective in cutting and transporting a soil sample {{in a short time}} period (36 ms) for all different soils studied in this experiment. The electro-pneumatic method was also capable of obtaining a consistent amount of soil sample with a coefficient of variation of less than 20 % for any individual treatments in the experimental design.

The camera uses a high performance design which produces near film quality images from an electronic system. The optical system of the camera incorporates a conventional camera body that was slightly modified, thus permitting the use of conventional camera accessories, such as telephoto lenses, wide-angle lenses, auto-focusing circuitry, auto-exposure circuitry, flash units, and the like. An image sensor, such as a charge coupled device ('CCD') collects the photons that pass through the camera aperture when the shutter is opened, and produces an <b>analog</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> indicative of the image. The analog image signal is read out of the CCD and is processed by preamplifier circuitry, a correlated double sampler, and a sample and hold circuit before it is converted to a digital signal.

40|$|The prime {{source of}} {{vibration}} and noise in a gear {{system is the}} transmission error between the meshing gears. Transmission error is caused by manufacturing inaccuracy, mounting errors, and elastic deflections under load. Gear designers often attempt to compensate for transmission error by modifying gear teeth. This is done traditionally by a rough "rule of thumb" or more recently {{under the guidance of}} an analytical code. In order for a designer to have confidence in a code, the code must be validated through experiment. NASA Glenn Research Center contracted with the Design Unit of the University of Newcastle in England for a system to measure the transmission error of spur and helical test gears in the NASA Gear Noise Rig. The new system measures transmission error optically by means of light beams directed by lenses and prisms through gratings mounted on the gear shafts. The amount of light that passes through both gratings is directly proportional to the transmission error of the gears. A photodetector circuit converts the light to an <b>analog</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>signal.</b> To increase accuracy and reduce "noise" due to transverse vibration, there are parallel light paths at {{the top and bottom of}} the gears. The two signals are subtracted via differential amplifiers in the electronics package. The output of the system is 40 mV/mm, giving a resolution in the time domain of better than 0. 1 mm, and discrimination in the frequency domain of better than 0. 01 mm. The new system will be used to validate gear analytical codes and to investigate mechanisms that produce vibration and noise in parallel axis gears...|$|E

The EP system was integrated with the prototype of soil sampling shank to develop a complete Real-Time Electro Pneumatic Soil Sampling System (REPS). The performance of the REPS system was tested during preliminary field tests, and performance was evaluated in a soil bin. The effects of traveling speed, soil moisture content, and pulse duration and pressure level on the amount of soil sample collected were investigated. All the factors in the experimental design were found to be highly significant (alpha= 0. 05) on the amount of soil sample obtained. The amount of sample were predicted with a high correlation coefficient (R 2 = 86) for all different soil moisture content. The REPS could be a strong candidate for real-time soil sensing system...|$|E

In such electromechanical type direct indicating devices, the applied pressure is directly measured by a sensing element with a suitable mechanism into an <b>analog</b> / digital <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> in terms of voltage, current or frequency. The generation of such signals is based upon some electromechanical effects viz. inductive, capacitive, resistive, piezoelectric, piezoresistive, reluctive, resonative and optoelectric etc. A {{wide range of}} such pressure measuring instruments is now commercially available in the market. The high-pressure technology and new applications demand that the best instrumentation should ensure the lowest measurement uncertainty, particularly in the fluid media. The calculation of the calibration results and associated uncertainties is a complex matter involving many influencing quantities. The present paper describes a novel method for evaluating uncertainty in pressure measurement using electromechanical type direct pressure indicating devices through statistical analysis of errors.

The gate is a three terminal on-chip device that consists of: (1) the input optical port, (2) the gate selection port, and (3) the output optical port. The device can be built monolithically using a standard multiple quantum well graded index separate confinement heterostructure laser configuration. The gate can be rapidly and repeatedly reprogrammed to perform any of the basic digital logic operations by using an appropriate <b>analog</b> <b>electrical</b> or optical <b>signal</b> at the gate selection port. Specifically, the same gate can be selected to execute one of the 2 basic unary operations (NOT or COPY), or one of the 6 binary operations (OR, XOR, AND, NOR, XNOR, or NAND), or one of the many logic operations involving more than two inputs. The speed of the gate for logic operations as well as for reprogramming the function of the gate is primarily limited to the small signal modulation speed of a laser, which can be on the order of tens of GHz. The reprogrammable nature of the universal gate offers maximum flexibility and interchangeability for the end user since the entire application of a photonic integrated circuit built from cascaded universal logic gates can be changed simply by adjusting the gate selection port signals...|$|R
