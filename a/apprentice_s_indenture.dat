This period was followed by the transcultural platform of the Pan-Pacific and Southeast Asian Women’s Association in the 1940 s and the contemporary women’s movement of the 1960 s led by the Fiji Young Women’s Christian Association. The latter was marked by convergences with and divergences from transnational discourses. The focus-feminisms of the 1980 s brought human rights to the forefront of women’s activism.

40|$|Building on {{companion}} work {{investigating the}} efficacy of financial statement insurance (FSI) {{as an alternative to}} traditional auditor liability (ssrn. com/abstract= 554863), this Article presents the terms of a national enabling statute to implement this concept. The Model Financial Statement Insurance Act uses the architecture of the U. <b>S.</b> Trust <b>Indenture</b> Act of 1939. It authorizes issuer application for qualification, in connection with annual proxy statement filings, of policies of financial statement insurance. The Model FSI Act deems a series of provisions necessary to achieve securities law objectives to be part of all financial statement insurance policies so proposed, and requires insurers to possess characteristics relating to financial capacity, independence from issuers and adequate regulatory supervision. It empowers the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission to issue stop orders against such applications in cases where insurers lack such qualifications. Qualifying policies are put to security holder vote and become effective when a registered public accounting firm engaged by the insurer issues an unqualified opinion that the financial statements provide a fair presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Later-discovered material misstatements result in covered losses under the policy, administered in accordance with terms the Model FSI Act deems included, along with other tailored policy terms not in contravention of the Act. While using a United States template, the Model FSI Act is designed to be adaptable for use in other countries and jurisdictions of the world...|$|R
40|$|Positioned in {{a lively}} current debate {{concerning}} how to design auditor incentives to optimize financial statement auditing, this Article presents the more ambitious financial statement insurance alternative. This breaks {{from the existing}} securities regulation framework to draw directly on insurance markets and law. Based on upon an evaluation of major structural and policy-related features of the concept, the assessment prescribes a framework to permit companies, on an experimental-basis and with investor approval, to use financial statement insurance as an optional alternative to the existing model of financial statement auditing backed by auditor liability. The financial statement insurance concept, pioneered by New York University Accounting Professor Joshua Ronen, promises considerable advantages compared to traditional financial statement auditing. As with any proposal, however, it presents challenges. This Article expands the model first sketched by Dr. Ronen, extending and interpreting it to examine its efficacy, attempting to show how certain limitations can be overcome. A chief challenge is relating state insurance law, the default applicable to insurance policies including FSI, to federal securities regulation. A general method is to develop for financial statement insurance the functional equivalent of the U. <b>S.</b> Trust <b>Indenture</b> Act of 1939 applicable to contracts governing public debt securities. This would allow substantial freedom of contract in policy terms, governed by state law, while mandating certain specific terms and establishing minimum federal parameters for others. Most other hurdles arising from the interplay between state insurance law and federal securities regulation can be overcome using disclosure, while more uncertain are issues associated with preserving insurer solvency if financial statement insurance is placed {{at the center of}} the public-company financial reporting system...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{split in}} the {{circuits}} regarding whether and when agency regulations may establish rights enforceable through 42 U. S. C. Section 1983. In 1987, in Wright v. City of Roanoke, the Supreme Court held that a statute and regulations interpreting the statute could create enforceable rights under Section 1983, but left unclear to what extent it had relied on the regulations alone to reach this conclusion. The District of Columbia Circuit and Sixth Circuit have held {{that at least some}} valid federal regulations may create rights enforceable through Section 1983. Concluding that only Congress by enacting a statute may create an individually enforceable right, however, the Third, Fourth, and Eleventh Circuits have held that an agency regulation cannot create an individual federal right enforceable through Section 1983. Most recently, in 2003, the Ninth Circuit in Save Our Valley v. Sound Transit held that valid agency regulations alone could not establish individual rights enforceable through Section 1983 because only Congress may establish enforceable rights through statutes, although one judge disagreed in a partial dissent. By contrast, during 2003, the First Circuit in Rolland v. Romney acknowledged that regulations by themselves could not establish enforceable rights, but the court concluded that an agency 2 ̆ 7 s regulations interpreting a statutory right could clarify a right so that it is sufficiently definite to be enforceable through a Section 1983 suit. In Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., the Supreme Court in 1984 stated that courts should give significant deference to agency regulations that provide a reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute or fill a 2 ̆ 2 gap 2 ̆ 2 in a silent statute, at least in those cases in which Congress has delegated to the agency the authority to issue regulations that 2 ̆ 2 carry the force of law. 2 ̆ 2 In 2001, in Alexander v. Sandoval, the Court concluded that a private right of action must be based on rights established in the statute and may not arise from regulations alone, declaring 2 ̆ 2 Language in a regulation may invoke a private right of action that Congress through statutory text created, but it may not create a right that Congress has not. 2 ̆ 2 The Court suggested that regulations alone may not establish individual rights, observing 2 ̆ 2 it is most certainly incorrect to say that language in a regulation can conjure up a private cause of action that has not been authorized by Congress. Agencies may play the sorcerer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>apprentice</b> but not the sorcerer himself. 2 ̆ 2 Although declining to apply Chevron deference in that case because the disparate impact regulations were broader than the statute 2 ̆ 7 s ban on intentional discrimination, Justice Scalia acknowledged in Sandoval that 2 ̆ 2 regulations, if valid and reasonable, authoritatively construe the statute itself. 2 ̆ 2 In 2002, in Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, the Court concluded that individual rights enforceable through Section 1983 are similar to implied rights of action because courts are required to 2 ̆ 2 determine whether Congress intended to create a federal right. 2 ̆ 2 Because the Court held in Sandoval that only Congress can create implied rights of action, the Gonzaga decision suggests that only Congress can create rights enforceable through Section 1983 and that regulations alone may not. The Gonzaga decision did not directly resolve, however, whether and to what extent regulations may interpret rights implicit in a statute. Although acknowledging that special care is required in evaluating the authority of agency regulations purporting to establish individual rights, this Article argues that courts should defer to agency regulations that clarify or further define individual rights reasonably implicit in a statute without contradicting the central underlying principle in Sandoval and Gonzaga that Congress alone possesses the legislative authority necessary to create individual rights in a statute. The First Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s Romney decision {{is a good example of}} a court using agency regulations to clarify the scope of a right that Congress clearly intended to create in a statute, but had appropriately chosen to delegate the details of implementation to an agency. Where Congress mandates or clearly implies that it is delegating to an agency the authority to issue regulations implementing an individual right that Congress intends to create on behalf of a class of individuals then the agency 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of the statutory 2 ̆ 2 rights 2 ̆ 2 contained in its regulations are presumptively enforceable through Section 1983...|$|R
40|$|Prior to {{the late}} nineteenth century, medical {{understanding}} of "contagion" {{was based on a}} direct two-stage person to person model of transmission, formalised in 1584 by Fracastorius (1484 - 1553). The agents of such disease were demonstrated to be pathogenic microorganisms by Pasteur in his germ Theory of Disease on 1870 - 1880. A new concept - that a living creature, itself unaffected, might be an immediate carrier of infectious disease, a "vector" came late to medical science. This paradigm shift in understanding, that there might be three or even multi-stage links in the chain of transmissibility, was to unlock the secret of prevention in what had hitherto been the killing epidemic diseases of humankind - plague, typhus, malaria and yellow fever. The intermediate causes of these diseases were shown to be arthropods - fleas, flies, lice and mosquitoes. Their discovery as "intermediate agents", over a brief three decades in the late nineteenth century, brought enlightenment to the long-known associations of disease with poor personal and civic hygiene, with swamps and with the miasmata associated with them. Linnaeus (1707 - 1778) was the first to suggest that insects might be carriers of disease, a theoretical idea further reinforced by Ehrenberg in 1838. The Scottish physician, Sir Henry Holland, (1788 - 1873), in his Medical Notes: On the Hypothesis of Insect Life as Cause of Disease, developed this theoretical model further. In July 1878, Pasteur showed that earthworms could carry anthrax ("charbon") spores in the earth casts of their alimentary canals and so be external agents for disease transmission. However, it was the meticulous research of six doctors - Dr Joseph Bancroft (1876) in Brisbane; Dr Patrick Manson (1879) in China; Dr David Bruce (1894) in Africa; Sir Ronald Ross (1897) in India; Dr Thomas Lane Bancroft (1899) in Burpengary near Brisbane in Australia; and Dr Charles-Jules-Henri Nicolle in Tunis in 1909 - who established the science of an extra "intermediate stage" in disease transmission, such links being essential to the lifecycles and hence transmission of the pathogenic microorganisms involved. The primary research linking insects as potential vectors of human disease was undertaken by Dr Joseph Bancroft (1836 - 1894) who identified the adult filarial worm (later named Wucheria bancrofti) in a lymphatic abscess on the arm of a butcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>apprentice</b> in Brisbane, Australia on December 21, 1876. In 1879, Dr Patrick Manson demonstrated that microfilariae underwent development in the mosquito, thus confirming that mosquitoes could serve as intermediate hosts of parasites which infected vertebrates. A crucial discovery was that of Sir David Bruce, who in 1894 showed that trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) could be passed experimentally from big-game animals to cattle by blood transmission of Trypanosomoa brucei, following the bite of the tsetse fly, Glossina morsitans. This work was followed by the work of Sir Ronald Ross of the Indian Medical Service, who in 1897 demonstrated Plasmodia parasites in the stomach wall of Anopheles mosquitoes which had been fed upon the blood of malarial patients. Bancroft himself believed that mosquitoes sucked up the microfilarial worms and then conveyed them to water by which further victims were infected by drinking. Bancroft 2 ̆ 7 s son, Dr Thomas Lane Bancroft (1860 - 1933) demonstrated in a meticulous series of experiments (1893 - 1901) that the mosquito was the intermediate host ad transmitting agent of Wucheria bancrofti and thus the cause of human clinical filariasis. Although it had been long known that the body louse, Pediculus, was associated with typhus, it was not until 1909 that Dr Charles Nicolle (1866 - 1936) working at the Institut Pasteur de Tunis, demonstrated that epidemic typhus was transmitted by a rickettsia carried by the body louse, a finding for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1928. This process of an intermediate carrier, itself not harmed by the pathogenic agent which it transmits, saw a further extension in the field of toxicology. In this latter, it was demonstrated that a poison or toxin could pass along one or more intermediate steps in an ecological food chain, before causing disease in creatures which form the penultimate or final links in such a chain. The most common example of this phenomenon is that of ciguatoxin - whose food-chain passage from invertebrates to lower vertebrates and then to humans is the cause of clinical ciguatera. This food-chain with its intermediate links was first suggested in 1958. This paper is an analysis of the evolution of scientific thought concerning the concept of an "intermediate agent", usually an arthropod, as an essential link in what from 1876 became known as a chain of disease transmission. The word "vector", to describe such an "intermediate agent", was first used (in the Encyclopaedia Britannica) in 1922. One task of medical history is to analyse the causes and perspective of those paradigm shifts which alter knowledge about disease. One such advance was the discovery of the phenomenon of "vectors" - living creatures which themselves are unaffected, but which might transmit pathogenic microorganisms from human victim to victim. Self-evident and taken for granted today, this milestone in the history of medical thinking constituted an advance which occurred over three decades {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century. It was a qualitative concept which extended the former sixteenth century two-stage concept of "contagion" to a three- or multiple-link chain with vector intermediates. That first use in 1876 of the term "intermediate host" and later "vector" referred to arthropods - especially mosquitoes, flies, lice and mites. By the first decade of the twentieth century, it was appreciated that arthropods could transmit viruses, rickettisias, bacteria, protozoans and multi-cellular parasites. This new paradigm of disease pathogenesis came late in the chronology of the history of medicine. This paper is a review of that development of thought concerning "vectors", discoveries which led ultimately to the potential control of a series of diseases which have figured greatly as killing epidemics throughout the chronology of medical history...|$|R
