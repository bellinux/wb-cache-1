5|$|Across Micronesia, {{impact from}} the typhoon was fairly limited. Winds on Nukuoro were {{estimated}} at 45–75km/h (30–45mph), resulting in minor {{damage to buildings}} and crops. Losses on the atoll reached $10,000. Lukunor, located farther west, experienced similar winds; however, damage was slightly more severe. Notable coastal impact took place, with portions of the dock and sea wall damaged. Damage across Lukunor <b>and</b> <b>nearby</b> islands amounted to $20,000.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Władysław {{gave the}} Russians the border town of Serpeysk <b>and</b> <b>nearby</b> territories, hoping {{to persuade the}} Tsar to join in an anti-Swedish alliance. However, the king was {{ultimately}} unable to overcome objections from the Polish-Lithuanian Sejm, who were unwilling to fight Sweden after the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś. The Russians, unable to see benefit in such an alliance, were also unenthusiastic, and the proposed alliance came to nothing.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of an}} {{operation}} {{that resulted in the}} Coral Sea battle, the Japanese Navy sent troops to occupy Tulagi <b>and</b> <b>nearby</b> islands in the southern Solomons. These troops—mainly members of the 3d Kure Special Naval Landing Force—occupied Tulagi on 3 May 1942, and constructed a seaplane, ship refueling, and communications base on Tulagi and the nearby islands of Gavutu, Tanambogo and Florida, all of which were soon operational. Aware of the Japanese efforts on Tulagi, the Allies' concern increased in early July 1942 when the Japanese Navy began constructing a large airfield near Lunga Point on nearby Guadalcanal. By August 1942, the Japanese had about 900 troops on Tulagi <b>and</b> <b>nearby</b> islands, and 2,800 personnel (many of whom were Korean and Japanese construction specialists and laborers) on Guadalcanal. The airfield—when complete—would protect Japan's major base at Rabaul, threaten Allied supply and communication lines, and establish a staging area for possible future offensives against Fiji, New Caledonia, and Samoa (Operation FS).|$|E

5|$|The {{failure of}} the Japanese to take Port Moresby and their defeat at Midway {{had the effect of}} leaving their base at Tulagi without {{effective}} protection from other Japanese bases. Tulagi was four hours flying time from Rabaul, the nearest large Japanese base. On 7 August 1942, 11,000 U.S. Marines landed on Guadalcanal and 3,000 U.S. Marines landed on Tulagi <b>and</b> <b>nearby</b> islands. The Japanese troops on Tulagi <b>and</b> <b>nearby</b> islands were outnumbered and killed almost to the last man in the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo while the U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal captured the airfield at Lunga Point without significant resistance. Thus began the Guadalcanal campaign that resulted in a series of large, combined-arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces {{over the next six months}} which—along with the New Guinea campaign—would decide the fate of Japanese efforts to secure the southern frontier of their empire in the Pacific.|$|E
