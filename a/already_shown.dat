She attended Tarakanita elementary school and Pelita Harapan {{junior and senior high}} school. Her talent in the performing arts has <b>already</b> <b>shown</b> itself since her childhood, especially in singing. She sang in church and was also sent to vocal courses.|$|E
5|$|The {{cell nucleus}} was {{discovered}} by Robert Brown in 1831. Demonstration of the cellular composition of all organisms, with each cell possessing all the characteristics of life, is attributed to the combined efforts of botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann (1810–1882) in the early 19th century although Moldenhawer had <b>already</b> <b>shown</b> that plants were wholly cellular with each cell having its own wall and Julius von Sachs had shown the continuity protoplasm between cell walls.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} did {{not give}} the Allies any tactical or strategic advantage; Howard notes that it provided experience for the planners in handling deception and for the Twenty Committee in proving the worth of double agents. Terry Crowdy, writing in 2008, argued that any experience that the LCS attained was limited {{by the lack of}} guidance from Cairo and knowledge of double agents. Dudley Clarke had <b>already</b> <b>shown</b> that the most effective method of deception involved the use of agents and faked wireless traffic, rather than major training and troop movements. Hardboiled was the first deception plan aimed at Norway. It led into several others, including Operation Tindall and Operation Solo, culminating in the 1944 Operation Fortitude North, one of the Allies' largest and most successful deceptions.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the loss}} of his father, Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven, selling {{newspapers}} and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home. He quickly learned the newsboy's patter and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him. According to later accounts, Skelton's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian Ed Wynn, approached Skelton, who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When the man asked Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger {{turned out to be one}} of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had <b>already</b> <b>shown</b> comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.|$|E

25|$|Cyclotomic polynomials are {{solvable}} in radicals, as {{roots of}} unity are themselves radicals. Moreover, there exist more informative radical expressions for th roots of unity {{with the additional}} property that every value of the expression obtained by choosing values of the radicals (for example, signs of square roots) is a primitive th root of unity. This was <b>already</b> <b>shown</b> by Gauss in 1797. Efficient algorithms exist for calculating such expressions.|$|E

25|$|Scharoun {{was born}} in Bremen. After passing his Abitur in Bremerhaven in 1912, Scharoun studied {{architecture}} at the Technical University of Berlin until 1914 (at the time called Königliche Technische Hochschule, the Royal Technical University of Berlin), {{but he did not}} complete his studies. He had <b>already</b> <b>shown</b> an interest in architecture during his school years. At the age of 16 he drafted his first designs, and at 18 he entered for the first time an architectural competition for the modernisation of a church in Bremerhaven.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} what led Ferdinando to recruit Cristofori. The Prince {{traveled}} to Venice in 1688 to attend the Carnival, so he may have met Cristofori passing through Padua on his way home. Ferdinando {{was looking for a}} new technician {{to take care of his}} many musical instruments, the previous incumbent having just died. However, it seems possible that the Prince wanted to hire Cristofori not just as his technician, but specifically as an innovator in musical instruments. It would be surprising if Cristofori at age 33 had not <b>already</b> <b>shown</b> the inventiveness for which he later became famous.|$|E
25|$|Evans had <b>already</b> <b>shown</b> {{interest}} in coaching and umpiring while a first-class cricketer. In the 1967-68 off-season, he travelled to Australia on a Winston Churchill Fellowship to study coaching methods. After {{his retirement in}} 1969, he returned to first-class cricket very quickly, qualifying as an umpire and being appointed to the first-class list for the 1971 English cricket season. In 1981, he graduated to the Test panel, and umpired his first Test in the dramatic match between England and Australia when Ian Botham's 149 and Bob Willis's eight for 43 won a match that had seemed lost. Later matches included England games against India, New Zealand and Pakistan, {{and he was one}} of the umpires for the first Test played by Sri Lanka in England in 1984.|$|E

25|$|Accurate {{calculations}} had <b>already</b> <b>shown</b> {{that the}} BMEWS system would give just ten to 25 minutes of warning {{in the case}} of an ICBM attack. The MIDAS system, as planned, would extend this warning time to about 30 minutes, giving the extra time needed for all of the Strategic Air Command's nuclear-armed heavy bombers to take off from their air bases, and hence proving to the Soviet government that it could not destroy these bombers in a sneak attack. Hence, the Soviets would be deterred from launching such an attack by a valid threat of nuclear retaliation. In addition, the MIDAS system should have been able to confirm radar detections from BMEWS of a thermonuclear attack, hence reducing the chances of an accidental nuclear false alarm from the radar system.|$|E
25|$|Maier then {{approached}} the Columbia Broadcasting System. CBS accepted paid religious programs but would the charge full commercial rate of $4500 per half-hour to broadcast over its thirty-four city network. An expense of over $200,000 annually seeming {{too much for}} the Synod during the depths of the Great Depression, the project was turned over to the Lutheran Layman’s League. The L.L.L. had <b>already</b> <b>shown</b> enthusiasm for religious broadcasting, and had great respect for Maier. In the end, the L.L.L. and Walther League were able to raise commitments of $94,000 by late summer – enough to sign the contract with CBS and commence broadcasting. With Maier as Speaker, The Lutheran Hour premiered on Thursday, October 2, 1930 at 10:00 (Eastern) or 7:00 (Pacific); immediately following CBS’s hit mystery, The Shadow.|$|E
