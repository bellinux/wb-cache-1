25|$|The {{declaration}} {{was also}} {{signed by the}} heads of the local Greek Orthodox metropolitan bishoprics: Vasileios of Dryinoupolis, Spyridon of Vela and Konitsa and Germanos of Korytsa. On the day of the declaration, Zografos notified the International Control Commission of his appointment as president of the provisional government and announced that the Epirotes would regard any attempt by the newly founded Albanian Gendarmerie to cross their border as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> and would resist it. The Autonomous Northern Epirus also included Himara, Delvino, Sarandë, and Përmet (Premeti).|$|E
25|$|Initially {{relations}} were generally cordial. Matthew Flinders recognized {{the success of}} his three week sojourn as due in good part to Noongar diplomacy, and Noongar rituals celebrated their reception of the newcomers in a ceremonial form. When settlement became more firmly established, however, misunderstandings over the obligations of reciprocity - some of the most productive land was being taken especially on the Upper Swan - led to sporadic clashes. An example of such misunderstandings was the Noongar land-management practice of setting fires in early summer, mistakenly seen as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> by the settlers. Conversely, the Noongar saw the settlers' livestock as fair game to replace the dwindling stocks of native animals shot indiscriminately by settlers. The only area that successfully resisted the usurpation of native land for any time was the area around the Murray River, which effectively blocked expansion of the tiny settlement at Mandurah for almost half a decade.|$|E

500|$|... "Live to Tell" [...] was {{generally}} well received by music critics, who frequently {{referred to it}} as the best ballad of her career. It was also a commercial success, becoming Madonna's third number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 and her first number-one on the Adult Contemporary chart. The song faced controversy when Madonna performed it on her 2006 Confessions Tour wearing a crown of thorns while hanging on a giant mirrored cross. The performance at Rome's Olympic Stadium was condemned as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> toward the Roman Catholic Church by religious leaders.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's {{performance}} of the song [...] "Live to Tell" [...] while hanging on a giant mirrored cross wearing a crown of thorns was met with strong negative reaction from religious groups. The performance at Rome's Stadio Olimpico was condemned as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> toward the Roman Catholic Church by religious leaders. Madonna responded saying that her main intention with the performance was to bring attention {{to the millions of}} children dying in Africa from hunger and poverty. The tour was recorded and broadcast on such channels as NBC in the United States and Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. A CD+DVD recording titled The Confessions Tour was also released.|$|E
500|$|According to Howard Linecar in {{his book}} on British coin designs and designers, [...] "Pistrucci held the cutting of these dies [...] as a {{bargaining}} counter in his relentless efforts to obtain the post of Chief Engraver at the Royal Mint". Pistrucci asked each new Master of the Mint for appointment to the position, until in 1828, amid Treasury concerns {{about how much money}} was being paid Pistrucci, he was made Chief Medallist, a new position, at a reduced salary; William Wyon became Chief Engraver. Milano wrote, [...] "the Italian artist took this as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> by his enemies." [...] At about this time, Pistrucci contracted an illness that affected his vision, slowing his work.|$|E

500|$|German {{prosecutors}} in Düsseldorf {{threatened to sue}} her for blasphemy, and Protestant bishop Margot Käßmann said that [...] "maybe the only way an aging superstar can attract attention is to offend people's religious sentiments." [...] The Russian Orthodox Church and the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia (FJCR) described Madonna's performance as amoral, and urged all members to boycott her upcoming concert in Moscow. The performance at Rome's Olympic Stadium—located near the Vatican—was condemned as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> toward the Roman Catholic Church by religious leaders. Italian cardinal Ersilio Tonini called the concert [...] "a blasphemous challenge to the faith" [...] and a [...] "profanation of the cross", also calling for Madonna to be excommunicated. Reverend Manfredo Leone described it as [...] "disrespectful, in bad taste and provocative".|$|E
500|$|The British {{had cleared}} the upper decks of American resistance, {{and most of}} Chesapeakes crew had taken refuge on the berth deck. A musket or pistol shot from the berth deck killed a British marine, William Young, who was {{guarding}} the main hatchway. The furious British crewmen then began firing through the hatchway at the Americans crowded below. Lieutenant Charles Leslie Falkiner of Shannon, {{the leader of the}} boarders who had rushed the maindeck, restored order by threatening to blow out the brains of the next person to fire. He then demanded that the Americans send up the man who had killed Young, adding that Chesapeake was taken and [...] "We have three hundred men aboard.

2500|$|Turkey has {{remained}} a close ally of the United States, supporting it in the War on Terror in the post-September 11 climate. However, the Iraq War faced strong domestic opposition in Turkey and as such, the Turkish Parliament couldn't reach the absolute majority of 276 votes needed for allowing U.S. troops to attack Iraq from Turkey, the final tally being 264 votes for and 250 against. This led to {{a brief period of}} cooling in relations, particularly following the [...] "hood event", which was perceived as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> in Turkey.|$|E

[...] When Rawn returned to the fort {{and said that he}} anticipated a battle with the Nez Perce, most of the volunteers left, declaring that “no <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> on their part should provoke the Indians.” [...] The next morning, July 27, less than 100 men were left to man the fort and oppose the Nez Perce.

2500|$|By 1580, {{not only}} had the [...] "universal ruler" [...] subdued all the {{countries}} which had occupied his attention {{for the last three}} decades but he also had the respect from neighboring states. He faced no internal or external threats (although Portuguese Goa considered it was technically at war with Burma for her interference in Ceylon). Instead of resting, he turned his gaze on Arakan, the kingdom he and Tabinshwehti unsuccessfully tried to conquer in 1545–1547. He determined that it was now time to reduce the western coastal kingdom to the vassal status it held under the Pagan kings once more. A year earlier, he had sent an embassy to Emperor Akbar of the Mughal Empire, which had just acquired Bengal in 1576, perhaps to ascertain whether his occupation of Arakan would be viewed as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> to the Mughals.|$|E

60|$|When Genghis Khan heard thus of {{the retreat}} {{of the emperor}} from his capital, he was, or pretended to be, much incensed.
