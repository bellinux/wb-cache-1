Although these children's behavior at 12 months is not a serious problem, {{they appear to be}} on developmental trajectories that will end in poor social skills and relationships. Because attachment styles may serve <b>as</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> later development, it may be appropriate to think of certain attachment styles as part of the range of attachment disorders.|$|E
25|$|High {{turnover}} {{often means}} that employees are {{dissatisfied with their}} jobs, especially when it {{is relatively easy to}} find a new one. It can also indicate unsafe or unhealthy conditions, or that too few employees give satisfactory performance (due to unrealistic expectations, inappropriate processes or tools, or poor candidate screening). The lack of career opportunities and challenges, dissatisfaction with the job-scope or conflict with the management have been cited <b>as</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> high turnover.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of the job, three {{determinants}} {{stand out}} <b>as</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> performance: (1) general mental ability (especially for jobs higher in complexity); (2) job experience (although {{there is a}} law of diminishing returns); and (3) the personality trait of conscientiousness (people who are dependable and achievement-oriented, who plan well). These determinants appear to influence performance largely through the acquisition and usage of job knowledge and the motivation to do well. Further, an expanding area of research in job performance determinants includes emotional intelligence.|$|E

25|$|IQ {{scores are}} used for {{educational}} placement, assessment of intellectual disability, and evaluating job applicants. Even when students improve their scores on standardized tests, they do not always improve their cognitive abilities, such as memory, attention and speed. In research contexts they have been studied <b>as</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> job performance, and income. They are also used to study distributions of psychometric intelligence in populations and the correlations between it and other variables. Raw scores on IQ tests for many populations have been rising at an average rate that scales to three IQ points per decade since the early 20th century, a phenomenon called the Flynn effect. Investigation of different patterns of increases in subtest scores can also inform current research on human intelligence.|$|E
25|$|The American Psychological Association's report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns {{stated that}} in the United States IQ tests <b>as</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> social {{achievement}} are not biased against African Americans since they predict future performance, such as school achievement, similarly {{to the way they}} predict future performance for Caucasians. While agreeing that IQ tests predict performance equally well for all racial groups, Nicholas Mackintosh also points out that there may still be a bias inherent in IQ testing if the education system is also systematically biased against African Americans, in which case educational performance may in fact also be an underestimation of African American children's cognitive abilities. Earl Hunt points out that while this may be the case that would not be a bias of the test, but of society.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, with {{advancement}} of biomedical sciences, {{a number of}} molecular markers in blood, other biospecimens and environment were identified <b>as</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> development or risk of a certain disease. Epidemiology research {{to examine the relationship}} between these biomarkers analyzed at the molecular level, and disease was broadly named “molecular epidemiology”. Specifically, [...] "genetic epidemiology" [...] has been used for epidemiology of germline genetic variation and disease. Genetic variation is typically determined using DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. Since the 2000s, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been commonly performed to identify genetic risk factors for many diseases and health conditions.|$|E

2500|$|In {{predicting}} the prognosis, {{there are several}} scoring indices {{that have been used}} <b>as</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> survival. Two such scoring systems are the Ranson criteria and APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) indices. Most, but not all studies report that the Apache score may be more accurate. In the negative study of the APACHE-II, the APACHE-II 24-hour score was used rather than the 48-hour score. In addition, all patients in the study received an ultrasound twice which may have influenced allocation of co-interventions. Regardless, only the APACHE-II can be fully calculated upon admission. As the APACHE-II is more cumbersome to calculate, presumably patients whose only laboratory abnormality is an elevated lipase or amylase do not need assessment with the APACHE-II; however, this approach is not studied. The APACHE-II score can be calculated at [...]|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, {{the authors}} {{assessed}} the role core self-evaluations may play in moderating the established relationship between family socioeconomic status and individual's academic achievement <b>as</b> <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> economic success later in life. [...] Previous literature has confirmed {{that if you}} grow up in an affluent family and have {{a higher degree of}} education, then you will be more economically successful. [...] Judge and Hurst (2007) found that core self-evaluations could strengthen this relationship. [...] In other words, an individual high in core self-evaluations {{will be more likely to}} capitalize on the advantages given to them via their families economic success or through their own academic achievements and will consequently be more likely to be financially successful later on in life. [...] The authors explain that individuals high in core self-evaluations cope better with events and situations they encounter in life and are motivated to consistently increase their performance and thus, are more likely to capitalize on the educational and financial advantages they already possess in young adulthood. [...] This will allow them to have greater economic success, as measured by their income, in mid-life.|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was {{broadening}} the scope of specific psychological and social work factors investigated <b>as</b> possible <b>predictors</b> <b>of</b> employees` mental health, focusing on mental distress (symptoms of anxiety and depression). Design was prospective full-panel (i. e. measurement of all variables at each time-point) with a two-year follow-up period. Data was gathered by questionnaire. Organizations represented {{a wide variety of}} occupations and job types. Study I included 20 organizations with 1971 respondents in the prospective sample. Study II included 48 organizations with a prospective sample of 3644 employees. Study III incorporated 63 organizations and had a prospective sample of 4158 employees. Different statistical designs were employed in all three studies. This was done as the optimal exposure-outcome measurement interval is unknown and to elucidate which factors were the most consistent predictors across analyses. Study I demonstrated both “normal” (i. e. work <b>as</b> <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> health) and “reversed” (i. e. health <b>as</b> <b>predictor</b> <b>of</b> work) relations between workplace bullying and mental distress. In study II, 14 of 19 work factors showed some prospective relation to incidence of mental distress “caseness”, while role conflict, support from immediate superior, fair leadership, and positive challenge were consistent <b>predictors.</b> Prevalence <b>of</b> “cases” was 11. 9...|$|R
