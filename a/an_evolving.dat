5|$|Most of the {{activity}} at the Marysvale volcanic field occurred during three separate intervals; ~3422mya, 2214mya and 95mya. Dacites and andesites were erupted above <b>an</b> <b>evolving</b> batholith in the first interval. Crystal-rich ash from the 27-million-year-old (myo) Three Creeks caldera, 24myo Big John caldera and 23myo Monroe Peak caldera hardened into tuff. The second and third intervals saw eruptions of great quantities of rhyolites. Alkali-rich rhyolite erupted in the second interval from the 19myo Mount Belknap caldera.|$|E

5|$|Sledd's {{advocacy}} {{of social change}} and <b>an</b> <b>evolving</b> understanding of biblical texts came at a high personal price. Given his chosen career of minister and professor, he never accumulated much personal wealth. Sledd died deep in debt, having lost the family home to foreclosure after the salaries of Candler professors were cut when financial support of the school fell during the Great Depression in the 1930s. His creditors obtained a deficiency judgment for the unpaid portion of his debt after the foreclosure and, following his death, forced the sale {{of some of his}} furniture and parts of his personal library in partial satisfaction of his remaining debts.|$|E

5|$|The {{system was}} {{published}} in 1960 {{as a result of}} an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the metre–kilogram–second system of units (MKS) rather than any variant of the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS). SI is intended to be <b>an</b> <b>evolving</b> system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 24th and 25th General Conferences on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 2011 and 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram, linking it to an invariant of nature rather than to the mass of a material artefact, thereby ensuring long-term stability.|$|E
