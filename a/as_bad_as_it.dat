25|$|James Anthony Froude, a {{well-known}} English intellectual, was an apologist for imperial rule. In 1886, he published Oceana, {{another one of}} Froude's works attacking the desire for self-rule in Australia. Like English in the West Indies, it was criticized for its superficial coverage of colonial affairs and Froude's lack {{of exposure to the}} native countries which he discussed. His next travelogue, The English in the West Indies, detailed his travels in the West Indies and his political opinions on the benefits of the Crown Colony form of government. Froude argued that if the West Indian colonies were allowed home rule, the large black population in those colonies would vote for black leaders who would strip away whites' rights. Froude attacked blacks as being racially inferior, and argued that slavery was not <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was commonly believed to be. Froude's work initially received good reviews in English newspapers and journals; however, it caused an outrage in the West Indian colonies.|$|E
5000|$|David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews {{gave the}} film two stars out of four, saying: [...] "It's {{hard to imagine}} Highlander II {{appealing}} to non-fans of the franchise, as the film barely captures the sense of fun that was so prevalent in the original. With its complicated storyline and dreary visuals, it occasionally feels more perfunctory than anything else—though, to be fair, <b>it's</b> nowhere near <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it's</b> been made out to be over the years." ...|$|R

He ended his thoughts on the matter by clearly stating that socialism wasn't communism. He has also noted that even before joining the Socialist Party, he [...] "always promoted a national socialized health plan, antiwar, favored a guaranteed annual income, advocated worker control and elimination of corporate control." ...|$|E
500|$|Zhou Lian, an {{associate}} professor of philosophy at Renmin University of China, and Ai Weiwei, an artist in Beijing, have publicly criticized Bo and his Chongqing Model for being wrong and lowering trust. Li Zhuang, a lawyer who was imprisoned as part of the [...] "Striking Black" [...] policy, said that [...] "the Chongqing model is problematic because the city's leaders do not follow the rule of law". According to Andrew J. Nathan, a political scientist at Columbia University, [...] "the risk for China is that this scandal could taint everyone in power and challenge the legitimacy of the regime". Furthermore, he said, “All the worst things you ever imagined are actually true” and “It’s not like nobody knew about this stuff, but now they know that it really is true and it’s <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> can possibly be.” ...|$|E
500|$|Love {{claimed she}} was misquoted by Hirschberg, and {{asserted}} {{that she had}} immediately quit using heroin during her first trimester after she discovered she was pregnant. Record executive Danny Goldberg, who {{was a friend of}} Love and Cobain's, defended her against the claims, and commented on her decision to be profiled in the piece: [...] "Courtney had this yearning for mass-culture acceptability and just couldn't say no to something like that. I had a sense of foreboding about it, but I had no idea it as gonna be <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was. [...] done a lot of stupid, self-destructive things, but I don't believe she screwed around with her pregnancy. Those allegations were anonymous." [...] Love would later claim that the publication of the article had serious implications for her marriage as well as Cobain's mental state, suggesting it was a factor in his suicide.|$|E

500|$|No {{music video}} was filmed for {{promotion}} of [...] "Nothing Fails". Initially {{it was reported}} by Daily Mirror that Madonna planned to shoot the video in Israel with actor Michael Douglas. According to Polly Graham from the newspaper, Warner Bros. executives {{were concerned about the}} singer's safety in Israel, but Madonna was adamant. [...] "Her record bosses are really worried about it. They are trying to talk her around, but she's having none of it. She has told them it makes sense to shoot it in Israel as the Kabbalah originates from there. Madonna is not particularly bothered about her safety and potential risks. She doesn't think it's <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> seems." [...] Her then husband Guy Ritchie was also facing difficulty with his project, Revolver, which was rejected by Sony Pictures executives since it contained references to Kabbalah, and they asked Ritchie to re-write the script. Since the video itself would have included symbolism from Kabbalah, Madonna ultimately decided to not film the music video. These reports were later refuted by the artist during an interview with San Francisco radio station Alice 97.3, where she explained that no music video would be shot for the single.|$|E
500|$|After the election, Perot {{continued}} to work with [...] "United We Stand", and focused his efforts to defeat the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In 1993, {{he was involved in}} a highly publicized debate with Vice President Al Gore on Larry King Live over NAFTA. Perot formed the Reform Party of the United States of America in 1995, and ran for president under the party's banner the following year. During the election, he failed to appear in the presidential debates, and finished in third place with about 8% of the vote, behind Republican nominee Bob Dole and President Bill Clinton. The Reform Party's candidate, former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, was elected as Governor of Minnesota in 1998, which was connected to Perot's performance in the presidential elections. His focus on a balanced budget during his campaigns is speculated to have brought the issue to the forefront, enabling the surplus of the late 1990s. [...] Perot declined to run in the 2000 presidential election, and endorsed eventual winner Republican Governor George W. Bush of Texas. In 2008, he endorsed Republican Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts for the presidency, and stated [...] "the situation in 1992 was not nearly <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is now... {{if ever there was a}} time when it was necessary to put our house in order, it is now." [...] The members of the populist Tea Party movement have been compared to Perot advocates, for their support of a balanced budget.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the films}} are presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} of Gone to Coney Island survives in The Moving Picture World from July 9, 1910. It states: [...] "Kate has been employed {{for a number}} of years as a maid in the home of Mrs. Greene. Her 'young man,' Henry, works down at Coney [...] He induces Kate to leave her place and take a situation as a ticket seller at Luna Park. Kate tries to tell her mistress of her intended departure, but Mrs. Greene is busy and refuses to listen. Mrs. Greene goes out, during her absence, Kate takes French leave, leaving a note saying she is going to Coney Island. Never having visited the Island, Mrs. Greene considers it a jungle place. When she gets Kate's note, she thinks that her duty to immediately start in pursuit of the misguided girl. Not knowing how to get to the island, she appeals to her old friend, Professor Griggs. He also is ignorant of the ways of Coney, but in turn appeals to his friend Casey, a ward politician, who of course knows the Island, and consents to act as their escort. The three set out for Coney and start on their search for Kate. The hunt is almost forgotten in the joys of looping the loop, shooting the chutes and various other diversions of the Island. When they finally find Kate, she is at her post, selling tickets at Luna. She laughs at Mrs. Greene's fears for her safety and announces the fact that she is happily married, and presents the lucky man. In a cool Coney corner, Mrs. Greene confesses that she found Coney wasn't <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was painted, and she is going to revisit it often." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a letter}} to his close friend, Venetia Stanley, the British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith wrote:"... the {{situation}} is just about <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> can possibly be. Austria has sent a bullying and humiliating ultimatum to Serbia, who cannot possibly comply with it, and demanded an answer within forty-eight hours-failing which she will march. This means, almost inevitably, that Russia will come to the scene in defence of Serbia and in defiance of Austria, and if so, it is difficult for Germany and France to refrain from lending a hand to one side or the other. So that we are in measurable, or imaginable, distance of a real Armageddon. Happily, {{there seems to be no}} reason why we should be anything more than spectators." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} scenes was the film's ending: Brian's crucifixion. Many Christian protesters said that it was mocking Jesus' suffering by turning it into a [...] "Jolly Boys Outing" [...] (such as when Mr Cheeky turns to Brian and says: [...] "See, not so bad once you're up!"), capped by Brian's fellow sufferers suddenly bursting into song. This is also reinforced by the fact that several characters throughout the film claim crucifixion is not <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> seems, such as when Brian asks his cellmate in prison what will happen to him, and he replies: [...] "Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion", and when Matthias, the old man who works with the PFJ, dismisses crucifixion as [...] "a doddle" [...] and says being stabbed would be worse. The director, Terry Jones, issued the following riposte to this criticism: [...] "Any religion that makes a form of torture into an icon that they worship seems to me a pretty sick sort of religion quite honestly." [...] Religious figures later responded by saying that Jones did not seem to understand the meaning of the crucifix symbol or its significance to Christians as a reminder of the suffering and death Christ endured for their sake. The Pythons also argued that crucifixion was a standard form of execution in ancient times and not just one especially reserved for Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|Rotten Tomatoes, {{a review}} aggregator, reports that 13% of 15 {{surveyed}} critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 3.6/10. [...] Contemporary reviews were generally negative. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "stale through and through, derived from countless cop-buddy formula thrillers, drenched in violence and devoid {{of so much}} as a whiff of real life." [...] Caryn James of The New York Times wrote, [...] "This story turns out to be much more mundane than its outrageously clever premise." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune wrote that the film's imaginative weapons and humor make it an entertaining crowd-pleaser but criticized its cynical violence and lack of moral consciousness. [...] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post compared it to Hardware and said its influences are more subtle, though it suffers from using too much humor. [...] Chris Hicks of the Deseret News wrote that the film [...] "isn't <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> has every right to be" [...] and [...] "provides some fun for fans of the genre". Lou Cedrone of The Baltimore Sun wrote, [...] "Apart from the gore, I Come in Peace is an amusing mixture of action, science-fiction and comedy." [...] Gary Thompson of the Philadelphia Daily News said that it is a better than usual rip-off of The Terminator with some original ideas. [...] Time Out London wrote, [...] "With an upbeat script and a healthy sense of humour, this is an unashamedly ridiculous affair with moderate ambitions and matching success." ...|$|E

2500|$|For the {{football}} season, Texas won their first fourgames although threeof them were closer than analysts had expected. In their next game Texas was beaten {{for a second}} year in a row by the Kansas State Wildcats 41–21 through play with no turnovers and 21 combined points from defense and special teams. [...] The Kansas State Wildcats scored onetouchdown on a punt return, oneon a kick return, and oneon an interception; Previously, Texas had never allowed all three types of scores in a single season. The 41points were the most scored against Texas in Austin since UCLA handed the Longhorns a 66–3 loss in 1997, and it was the worst home defeat in the Mack Brown era at Texas. Texas lost again the following week in the 2007 Red River Shootout, 28–21. With that loss, Texas opened conference play 0–2 for the first time since 1956, when they were in the Southwest Conference and one year before Darrell Royal became head coach of the Longhorns. But that was <b>as</b> <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> got for Mack Brown during the first decade of the 21st century. In their ninth regular season game, Texas outscored Nebraska 28–25, marking Brown's 100th win at Texas. In their next two games, the Longhorns would defeat Oklahoma State and Texas Tech, but in their final matchup against archrival Texas A, the Longhorns lost 30–38. This marked the Longhorns' second straight loss to the Aggies. Despite the loss, Texas went to the Holiday Bowl to defeat 11th-ranked Arizona State 52–34. The Longhorns finished the season 10–3, marking their seventh consecutive 10-win season, the third longest of all time in FBS history, trailing Florida State's 14 from 1987–00 and Miami's 8 from 1985–92.|$|E
