40|$|In this Paper we analyse {{whether the}} {{emergence}} of electronic money <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> affect the optimal size of monetary unions.

In a second scenario, electronic payments systems free ride on the existing national payments systems, which remain firmly in place.

5|$|The {{consequences}} of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last {{for at least five}} million years. It could result in a decline in biodiversity and homogenization of biotas, accompanied by a proliferation of species that are opportunistic, such as pests and weeds. Novel species may also emerge; in particular taxa that prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. Microbes <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large vertebrates <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> arise and food chains will probably be shortened.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are various}} reasons that a species {{exhibits}} their particular survivorship curve, but one contributor can be environmental factors that decrease survival.
