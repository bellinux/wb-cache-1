25|$|Juin did {{not want}} Algeria {{occupied}} by the Americans <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> wanted France occupied by the Germans, but he recognised {{the reality of the}} situation. Darlan authorised Juin to negotiate a local ceasefire in Algiers, so Juin met with American Major General Charles W. Ryder, commander of the U.S. 34th Infantry Division, and the two arranged {{for an end to the}} fighting. Algiers was handed over to the Americans, French troops were confined to barracks but retained their weapons, and French police maintained law and order. French resistance to the Allies continued elsewhere in North Africa until Darlan issued a ceasefire on 10 November, and directed Juin to order French forces in Tunisia to resist the Germans and the Italians. Juin's orders were not always obeyed by his subordinates in Tunisia, many of whom believed that Darlan and Juin were being held prisoner by the Americans, but he was able to personally persuade Noguès to work with the Allies.|$|E
500|$|A leitmotif is a {{recurring}} musical theme {{within a particular}} piece of music, associated with a particular person, place or idea. Wagner is the composer most often associated with leitmotifs, and Parsifal makes liberal use of them. Wagner did not specifically identify or name leitmotifs in the score of Parsifal (<b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> did in any other of his scores), although his wife Cosima mentions statements he made about {{some of them in}} her diary. However, Wagner's followers (notably Hans von Wolzogen whose guide to Parsifal was published in 1882) named, wrote about and made references to these motifs, and they were highlighted in piano arrangements of the score. Wagner's own reaction to such naming of motifs in the score was one of disgust: [...] "In the end people believe that such nonsense happens by my suggestion." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian Lawrence Norfolk {{commented that}} Sarah is a [...] "far from perfect heroine: a semi-neglectful mother and unfaithful wife", but noted that [...] "Cleave does not mock Sarah (and life in Kingston upon Thames) <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> does Little Bee and her {{experiences}} in Nigeria." [...] Norfolk felt that: [...] "For all the characters' faults, {{none of them}} is presented as inauthentic or standing for something that we are intended to disbelieve. On the disparity in sympathy for Sarah and Little Bee, Cleave assessed: [...] "Sarah inevitably suffers by proximity to Little Bee, who {{is much easier to}} like. If Sarah is more twisted, I think it's because her path through life has necessarily been more convoluted. Little Bee's life is extremely harrowing but it is also very simple – she is swimming very hard against the current, struggling to survive and not to be swept away. Sarah doesn’t have the luxury of knowing in which direction she should swim." ...|$|E

2500|$|If {{he wants}} to {{calculate}} how fast his twin was aging when the image was transmitted, he adjusts for the Doppler shift. For example, when he receives high frequency images (showing his twin aging rapidly) with frequency , he does not conclude that the twin was aging that rapidly when the image was generated, <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> concludes that the siren of an ambulance is emitting the frequency he hears. He knows that the Doppler effect has increased the image frequency by the factor 1 / (1 − v/c). Therefore, he calculates that his twin was aging {{at the rate of}} ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Philander {{lifted his}} other eye {{out of the}} mud and gazed in {{speechless}} rage at Professor Porter. Then he attempted to rise; nor could there have been <b>any</b> <b>more</b> surprised <b>than</b> <b>he</b> when his efforts were immediately crowned with marked success.|$|R

60|$|The shell-fire ceased as Jerry trotted along; next {{he heard}} the rifle- fire from the landing-party, as it shot down the {{domestic}} pigs on Somo's streets.

"That's what I call good discipline," [...] said Borroughcliffe, with an exulting laugh; [...] "I {{knew the}} lad would not mind me <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> that <b>he</b> would obey {{the orders of}} that lamp.

60|$|The old Munchkin {{turned and}} looked at Ojo. He had kindly eyes, but he hadn't smiled or laughed in so long that the boy had {{forgotten}} that Unc Nunkie could look any other way than solemn.

60|$|Henderson proved totally {{different}} from any master Michael had had. The man was a neutral sort of creature. He was neither good nor evil. He neither drank, smoked, nor swore; nor did he go to church or belong to the Y.M.C.A. He was a vegetarian without being a bigoted one, liked moving pictures when they were concerned with travel, {{and spent most of}} his spare time in reading Swedenborg. He had no temper whatever. Nobody had ever witnessed anger in him, and all said he had the patience of Job. He was even timid of policemen, freight agents, and conductors, though he was not afraid of them. He was not afraid of anything, <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> was <b>he</b> enamoured of anything save Swedenborg. He was as colourless of character as the neutral-coloured clothes he wore, as the neutral-coloured hair that sprawled upon his crown, as the neutral-coloured eyes with which he observed the world. Nor was <b>he</b> a fool <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> was <b>he</b> a wise man or a scholar. He gave little to life, asked little of life, and, in the show business, was a recluse in the very heart of life.|$|R

6000|$|John Rudstock, of {{vigorous}} physique, {{had opposed}} the war, on principle, from the start, not because, <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Wilderton, <b>he</b> approved of Prussianism, but because, as an essentially combative personality, he opposed {{everything that was}} supported by a majority; the greater the majority, the more bitterly he opposed it; and no one would have been <b>more</b> astonished <b>than</b> <b>he</b> at hearing that this was his principle. He preferred to put it that he did not believe in opposing Force by Force. In peace-time he was a [...] "stalwart," [...] in war-time a [...] "renegade." ...|$|R
