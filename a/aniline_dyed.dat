50|$|Paul Mendelssohn Bartholdy (born Paul Felix Abraham Mendelssohn Bartholdy; 18 January 1841, Leipzig - 17 February 1880, Berlin) was a German chemist and {{a pioneer}} in the {{manufacture}} of <b>aniline</b> <b>dye.</b> He co-founded the Aktien-Gesellschaft für Anilin-Fabrikation (AGFA), a German chemical company.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} form of colorization introduced limited color into {{a black-and-white}} film using dyes, {{as a visual}} effect. The earliest Edison films, most notably the Anabelle Butterfly Dance series, were also the earliest examples of colorization, done by painting <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes</b> onto the emulsion.|$|R
50|$|William H. Perkin, {{a student}} of Hofmann, {{synthesized}} the first <b>aniline</b> <b>dye.</b> That dye, called mauve, was a dye {{that would make a}} big success in the dye-industry. Perkin and Hofmann artificially created a series of textile dyes that substituted for costly biological products.|$|R
50|$|The {{process for}} tinting was laborious, {{although}} simple in principle. Editing {{was done in}} rolls based on tint color, with numbered frames of film in between scenes for later assembly. Once these rolls were printed and processed from the negative, they were immersed in <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes,</b> specified to the colors that were listed in the script or continuity. Hardening fixer was not used on the film {{in order for the}} dye to be imbibed into the emulsion quicker and with better results. Once the film had dried on large film drums, it would be assembled in correct order and rewound onto reels for shipping. Toning was similar, but instead of <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes,</b> the film was immersed in chemicals to change the silver image into colored salts.|$|R
5000|$|In 1856, whilst {{trying to}} {{synthesise}} quinine, von Hofmann's student William Henry Perkin discovered mauveine {{and went into}} industry producing the first synthetic <b>dye.</b> Other <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes</b> followed, such as fuchsine, safranine, and induline. At the time of mauveine's discovery, aniline was expensive. Soon thereafter, applying a method reported in 1854 by Antoine Béchamp, it was prepared [...] "by the ton". [...] The Béchamp reduction enabled {{the evolution of a}} massive dye industry in Germany. Today, the name of BASF, originally Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik (English: Baden Aniline and Soda Factory), now among the largest chemical suppliers, echoes the legacy of the synthetic dye industry, built via <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes</b> and extended via the related azo dyes. The first azo <b>dye</b> was <b>aniline</b> yellow.|$|R
5000|$|Indelible pencils {{were the}} cause of {{significant}} health risks due {{to the presence of}} <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes.</b> Exposure to <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes</b> could lead to eczema, acne and carcinoma. Penetration of the pencil lead into the body commonly leads to severe and debilitating effects such as fever, anaemia, elevated white cell count, gastro-intestinal upset, kidney and liver damage, anorexia and necrosis of the tissue surrounding the wound. Such risks are not associated with ordinary graphite pencils. While these symptoms may appear after a couple of days they often develop only after weeks have passed since the injury was sustained. Surgery is required to remove the lead and the infected tissue and [...] "the necrotizing action may be so severe and extensive amputation is necessary".|$|R
50|$|Van Patten {{became an}} expert in <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes,</b> which had been {{discovered}} in England in the mid-1800s. His success at creating and finding household uses for these compounds made Wells, Richardson one of the country's leading producers of them, and Van Patten became wealthy as a result.|$|R
5000|$|Methemoglobinemia may be acquired. [...] Classical drug {{causes of}} methemoglobinaemia include {{antibiotics}} (trimethoprim, sulfonamides, and dapsone), local anesthetics (especially articaine, benzocaine, and prilocaine), and <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes,</b> metoclopramide, rasburicase, chlorates, and bromates. Ingestion of compounds containing nitrates (such as the patina chemical bismuth nitrate) {{can also cause}} methemoglobinemia.|$|R
500|$|The first {{synthetic}} dyes {{were discovered}} in the mid-19th century, starting with William Henry Perkin's mauveine in 1856, an <b>aniline</b> <b>dye</b> derived from coal tar. Alizarin, the red dye present in madder, was the first natural pigment to be duplicated synthetically, in 1869, leading {{to the collapse of}} the market for naturally grown madder. [...] The development of new, strongly colored <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes</b> followed quickly: a range of reddish-purples, blues, violets, greens and reds became available by 1880. These dyes had great affinity for animal fibres such as wool and silk. [...] The new colors tended to fade and wash out, but they were inexpensive and could be produced in the vast quantities required by textile production in the industrial revolution. By the 1870s commercial dyeing with natural dyestuffs was fast disappearing.|$|R

40|$|The {{extracellular}} colorants {{produced by}} Chlorociboria aeruginosa, Scytalidium cuboideum, and Scytalidium ganodermophthorum, three commonly utilized spalting fungi, were tested against a standard woodworker’s <b>aniline</b> <b>dye</b> {{to determine if}} the fungal colorants could be utilized in an effort to find a naturally occurring replacement for the synthetic dye. Fungal colorants were delivered in two methods within a pressure treater—the first through solubilization of extracted colorants in dichloromethane, and the second via liquid culture consisting of water, malt, and the actively growing fungus. Visual external evaluation of the wood test blocks showed complete surface coloration of all wood species with all colorants, {{with the exception of the}} green colorant (xylindein) from C. aeruginosa in liquid culture, which did not produce a visible surface color change. The highest changes in external color came from noble fir, lodgepole pine, port orford cedar and sugar maple with <b>aniline</b> <b>dye,</b> cottonwood with the yellow colorant in liquid culture, lodgepole pine with the red colorant in liquid culture, red alder and Oregon maple with the green colorant in dichloromethane, and sugar maple and port orford cedar with the yellow colorant in dichloromethane. The <b>aniline</b> <b>dye</b> was superior to the fungal colorants in terms of internal coloration, although none of the tested compounds were able to completely visually color the inside of the test blocks...|$|R
50|$|After the {{discovery}} of mauveine, many new <b>aniline</b> <b>dyes</b> appeared (some discovered by Perkin himself), and factories producing them were constructed across Europe.Towards {{the end of the}} century, Perkin and other British companies found their research and development efforts increasingly eclipsed by the German chemical industry which became world dominant by 1914.|$|R
