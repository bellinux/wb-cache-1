5|$|In the late-19th century, the Sleaford {{area was}} a major barley {{producer}} and by the 1880s, Sleaford was a stop on railway lines connecting the town to Boston, Grantham, Bourne, Spalding and Lincoln. These qualities made the town desirable {{for the production of}} malt, a crucial ingredient in beer production. The brewers Bass, Ratcliffe and Gretton Ltd were attracted to the town and in 1880 proposed a new malting complex there, which would consolidate malting closer to the barley source and reduce costs by up-scaling production. Drilling in 1892 revealed suitable <b>artesian</b> <b>water</b> sources under Sleaford; plans were submitted nine years later and over 13 acres of land off Mareham Lane was purchased; work started in 1901 and was complete by 1907.|$|E

This removed the breeding grounds of the mosquito vector.

In 2011, the city of Olympia committed $50,000 towards improvements of an artesian well, located {{in a parking lot}} that was recently purchased by the city. Renovations at the artesian well were completed in late 2011, including surface improvements, solar lighting, and a raised area to fill bottles.

25|$|Citrus {{in central}} Florida did well until the Great Freeze of 1894-5. Many growers {{abandoned}} their groves entirely, but Mead recognized that below ground <b>artesian</b> <b>water</b> {{at a constant}} 70 degrees might provide relief from frost and allow citrus trees to survive freezing temperatures. His engineering background led him to postulate that overhead water irrigation of the trees hanging with fruit could keep the fruit protected from damage at 32° within an ice cocoon regardless of how low the mercury fell. He successfully covered an acre of oranges, installed a pump and irrigation system, and proved the concept, the first known description of a technique still used today.|$|E
500|$|Until 1993, <b>artesian</b> <b>water</b> was {{not known}} {{to be present in}} the Island of Hawaii. Drilling by the University of Hawaii at that time {{encountered}} an artesian groundwater aquifer at 300 meters below sea level and 100 meters of hole depth within a compacted layer of soil and lava where the flows of both Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea meet (Humuula saddle region). Isotopic composition shows the water present to have been derived from rain coming off Mauna Kea at an elevation higher than 2000 meters above mean sea level. Its presence is attributed to a freshwater head within Mauna Kea's basal lens. Scientists believe there may be more water in Mauna Kea's fresh water lens than current models may indicate. In 2012 two more bore holes were drilled on Mauna Kea and water discovered at much higher elevations than previously believed but shallower than expected. Donald Thomas, director of the University of Hawaii's Center for the Study of Active Volcanoes believes one reason to continue study of the aquifers is due to use and ‘occupancy’ of the higher elevation areas, stating: [...] "Nearly all of these activities depend on the availability of potable water that, in most cases, must be trucked to the Saddle from Waimea or Hilo — an inefficient and expensive process that consumes a substantial quantity of our scarce liquid fuels.” ...|$|E
