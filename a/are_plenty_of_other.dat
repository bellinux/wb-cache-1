25|$|As the Whites took Vyborg {{under their}} control, they {{conducted}} a large mass execution. Some 1,200 people were shot, including up to 400 Russians {{and people of}} associated ethnicities. Today their execution is considered as an ethnic cleansing. Ironically, most of the Russian victims were White supporters and even had greeted them as liberators. Included in the number <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> foreign nationalities who were also executed, as the Whites possibly mistook them as Russians. Other nationalities included Ukrainians, Polish, Estonian, Tatars, Jews and Italians. The largest mass executions were {{carried out in the}} Annenkrone fort on the western side of the city. Youngest of the executed were only 12–13-year-old children and at least three civilian women were also shot.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{the police}} {{have been known to}} crack down on certain occurrences in the park, when it comes to Hippie Hill, the SFPD has been known to be lenient with what goes on there. This {{leniency}} seems to increase during things like concerts and other public events. As supervisor London Breed stated, [...] "smoking anything in any city park is illegal, but San Francisco has a tradition of turning a blind eye to infractions for official or unofficial events." [...] The police department has stated that they are not naïve enough to attempt to catch all the people smoking marijuana at the hill, but as Police Chief Greg Suhr said, [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> things that came with it that we will not have." ...|$|E

Beric made no reply, {{and the subject}} was not again alluded to at that time; but the emperor {{returned}} to it on other occasions, and Beric at last was driven to refuse point blank.|$|E

50|$|In 326 BC, Nearchus {{was made}} admiral {{of the fleet}} that Alexander had built at the Hydaspes (A 6.2.3; Indica 18.10). However, his trierarchy was a {{financial}} responsibility - that is, Nearchus put up {{the money for the}} boats (Heckel, p. 229); and there <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> trierarchs in the Indus fleet who were not natural born sailors.|$|R
50|$|Food {{is sought}} largely in trees but brown jays also take some {{food from the}} ground. They are rather {{indiscriminate}} feeders. Insects and a wide range <b>of</b> <b>other</b> invertebrates are taken, also lizards, nectar, and fruit (e.g. that of Trophis racemosa (Moraceae)). Though they will take eggs and nestlings, they appear not to if there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> food available.|$|R

"If St. Leger {{knows that}} a man of Colonel Willett's rank was eager to take the chances of leaving the {{fortification}} to summon assistance, he must believe the garrison is in sore straits, an' therefore it is that I believe the mistake was made in allowin' him to go out when there <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> here willin' to take the chances." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, it's {{all very}} well that these big people should be frightened out of their wits by an old wife talking with her mouth shut; {{that is one of}} the things we happen to know about. All the old women in the world might talk with their mouths shut, and not frighten you or me, but there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> things that frighten us badly. And if we only knew about them, perhaps we should find them no more worthy to be feared than an old woman talking with her mouth shut. And the names of some of these things are Death, and Pain, and Sorrow.|$|E

I want to live, and I will live, and I grudge every moment out of which I am not extracting the fullest amount of happiness. That's because I've paid. It's the woman's bargaining instinct, you know. She wants to get value.... Now I want to hear about Miss Dalstan. Where did you meet her, and how did you get her to accept your play?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Notwithstanding {{all this}} he still hankers after her and swears she shall be his. He {{is not a}} bad-looking fellow, and from what we know of the market, we should say there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> girls who would jump at him; yet {{for the sake of}} {{settling}} down with this dismal young female as his wife, he is prepared to go through a laborious and exhaustive course of crime and to be bullied and insulted by every one he meets. His love sustains him under it all. He robs and forges, and cheats, and lies, and murders, and arsons. If there were any other crimes he could commit to win her affection, he would, for her sweet sake, commit them cheerfully. But he doesn't know any others--at all events, he is not well up in any others--and she still does not care for him, and what is he to do? ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{moment or}} two later the stout gentleman appeared, wiping his mouth, evidently feeling in a better humor, and ready to make up with his pretty neighbor. Smiling blandly, {{he was about to}} remove the valise, when Miss Dolly laid her hand upon it, saying with great dignity, [...] "This seat is engaged, sir.

50|$|The defense {{attempted}} {{to show that}} others had made the same design independently before Glidden, but the plaintiff was able to assert that indeed the other productions, which were of virtually similar design, were not made until after he issued his patent. The court agreed that there had <b>been</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> attempts to create a similar design and product as Glidden, but none had been successful nor had they been successfully patented.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is nothing}} to to-morrow's, as you will see," [...] Mr Harvey replied. [...] "Traders {{consider}} this defile {{to be the very}} hardest passage anywhere in South Africa, and there <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> bad bits too. In many cases you will see we shall have to unload the waggons, and it will be all that a double team can do to pull them up empty. Sometimes of course the defile is easier than at others; it depends much upon the action of the last floods. In some years rocks and boulders have been jammed so thickly in the narrow parts that the defile has been absolutely impassable; the following year, perhaps, the obstruction has been swept away, or to a certain extent levelled by the spaces between the rocks being filled up with small stones and sand. How it is this season, I do not know; up to the time we left I had heard of no trader having passed along this way. I have spoken of it as a day's journey, but it is only under the most favourable circumstances that it has ever been accomplished in that time, and sometimes traders have been three or four days in getting through." ...|$|E
6000|$|There <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> club-bores {{besides the}} man who rates these {{generally}} affable and well-behaved persons, the club servants. One of the worst is {{the man who}}m you never see anywhere except at the club, and whom you never fail to see there. It is bad enough when you have no acquaintance with him. Murders have probably been committed by sensitive persons for no better reason (often for worse reasons) than that they are tired of seeing some one else going about. His voice, his manner, his cough, especially his cough, become unendurable. People who cough in clubs are generally amateurs of the art. They are huskier, more wheezing, more pertinacious in working away at a cough till they have made it a masterpiece than any other mortals. We believe that club Asthmats (it is quite as good a word as [...] "AEsthetes") practise in the Reading Room of the British Museum, where they acquire their extraordinary compass and mastery of various notes. Be this as it may, the cough which drives every one but its owner {{out of the room}} (though doubtless an affliction to the proprietor) gives him rank as a club-bore of the finest water. The bore who always enters into conversation, though he has nothing to say, merely because you used to dislike him at school, or college, or elsewhere, is another common annoyance. The man who is engaged, apparently, on a large work, and who rushes about the library hunting for Proclus and Jamblichus when other occupants of the room wish to be quiet, is naturally detested.|$|E

5000|$|In July 1993, {{the second}} {{instance}} court upheld {{the findings of}} guilt and the penalties imposed. The third instance court hearing in December 1993 confirmed {{the judgment of the}} second instance court. It was claimed that the trial was a showcase and the accused had not had a fair hearing. However the court rejected the call for a retrial of Damjanović, saying that [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> evidence sufficient for a verdict." ...|$|R
