40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{adaptive}} efficient job scheduling service model on Grids using multi agent systems and a market like Service level Agreement (SLA) negotiation protocol based on the Contract Net model. This job scheduling service model involves four types of agents: <b>service</b> user <b>agents,</b> <b>service</b> provider <b>agents,</b> local scheduler agents and inter-grid <b>agents.</b> <b>Service</b> provider <b>agents</b> provide <b>services</b> to <b>service</b> user <b>agents</b> by allocating resources using local scheduler <b>agents.</b> <b>Service</b> provider <b>agents</b> provide <b>services</b> to <b>service</b> user <b>agents</b> by allocating resources using local scheduler <b>agents.</b> The <b>service</b> provider <b>agents</b> may contact the inter-grid agents if enough resources are not available in their own grid. Inter-grid agents provide resources from the neighboring grid. The <b>service</b> provider <b>agent</b> may adapt the dedicated service according to its interactions with <b>service</b> user <b>agent.</b> The SLA negotiation protocol is a hierarchical bidding mechanism involving negotiations between the four agents. In this protocol, the agents exchange SLA announcements, SLA-bid, and SLA-awards to negotiate the schedule of jobs on Grid Compute resources. To deal {{with the presence of}} uncertainties, renegotiation is used to allow the agents to re-negotiate the SLA in failur...|$|R

The effective way to keep the cognitive ability is suggested by keeping the cognitive impairment them in the social relationship with the others. But it has difficulty because of the family relationship has changed, so individual has less time for other relatives, friends and family 1. Based on the social background, <b>agent</b> <b>service</b> which assists the dementia people has provided.

40|$|Abstract. Networks are {{becoming}} {{much more complicated}} in their support of ubiquitous computing. For example, broadband mobile communications, wireless ad-hoc networks, IPv 6, and so on. Technology is moving towards mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), which create temporary networks. The use of mobile devices for composing MANETs is growing, and {{it is necessary to}} provide <b>agent</b> <b>service</b> for them. In this paper, we propose a mobile agent platform for supporting MANETs. The proposed algorithms provides <b>agent</b> <b>service</b> among mobile devices, choose an AMS and a DF Service Provider (ADSP) dynamically, maintain the ADSP through another device, and route packets between agents that are unable to communicate. We implement a prototype of these algorithms, based on the Bluetooth protocol. We verify efficient agent management on MANETs, which is not supported by existing mobile agent platforms...|$|E
