5|$|A {{music video}} was issued in November 2003 {{to promote the}} single. The video shows Sebastian on <b>a</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set</b> as it is being {{prepared}} for a show. He is dressed casually in jeans and windcheater. He sits on boxes as he begins to sing with a camera crew starting to film him. An image {{of a young woman}} is shown as he continues. Various personnel walk around him and adjust the set. Sebastian stands and the image of the female is seen again, she wears white feathers. Later, Sebastian is dressed more formally in a white suit as he performs the song. On this set are plasma screens depicting the same young woman. The video ends with Sebastian in his casual gear again, sitting on the boxes. The video was produced by Australian Idols Stephen Tate and directed by the show's musical director, John Foreman. On 22 November, the clip was premiered on Network Ten's Video Hits – which had Tate as executive producer.|$|E

500|$|Two main {{types of}} {{electron}} microscopes exist: transmission and scanning. Transmission electron microscopes function like overhead projectors, with {{a beam of}} electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected by lenses on a photographic slide or a charge-coupled device. [...] Scanning electron microscopes rasteri a finely focused electron beam, as in <b>a</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set,</b> across the studied sample to produce the image. Magnifications range from 100× to 1,000,000× or higher for both microscope types. The scanning tunneling microscope uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal tip into the studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of its surface.|$|E
500|$|... "Coming Home" [...] {{starts with}} scenes {{of a black}} {{helicopter}} flying over the desert. In some of the shots, Diddy can be seen looking out on to the horizon. As the song progresses into its main verses, the camera follows Diddy walking through the desert. In the background and foreground, the fire-damaged remnants of a home such as <b>a</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set,</b> fur coats and a stereo system are scattered across the landscape. During the chorus Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper take place {{in front of the}} camera, walking behind Diddy miming Grey's words. Later in the clip, during the second verse, Diddy sits in a burned out building singing to himself. Outside, a burned out vehicle is parked. Then during the song's bridge, red smoke surrounds Diddy as the helicopter, from the opening scene, comes to land. However, this time Richard and Harper are seated inside waiting for Diddy. As the song fades, the helicopter flies over the desert toward the horizon.|$|E

After again facing the Innocentz in a graveyard and abandoned factory, Cash is forced to face off, in what {{is supposed to be}} the final scene of the film, against a gang of schizophrenic, sociopaths called [...] "The Smileys" [...] who have taken over an insane asylum. Here, Cash unexpectedly survives, killing the Smileys (including their leader dressed in a rabbit costume) and escaping the asylum after killing several Cerberus. As such, the Director deploys the remaining Wardogs, led by the vicious Ramirez (Chris McKinney), to hunt Cash down and kill him; from this point on, the Director no longer communicates to Cash.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the music video for [...] "Hollywood", Samuel Bourdin, the son of Guy Bourdin, filed a federal lawsuit that accused Madonna of ripping off the work of his father. Bourdin said they are [...] "strikingly similar" [...] to {{pictures}} taken by his father from the 1950s to 1980s decades and published in French Vogue magazine. He accused Madonna of copyright infringement over at least eleven of Bourdin's works, including one of Madonna with her legs spread on top of <b>a</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set.</b> [...] "It's one thing to draw inspiration; it's quite another to simply plagiarize {{the heart and soul of}} my father's work", Bourdin said at the time. Included in Bourdin's federal complaint were side-by-side comparisons of his father's work with images with stills from the [...] "Hollywood" [...] video. According to Dustin Robertson, editor of the [...] "Hollywood" [...] video, the sequences featuring Madonna in a red dress staring into a mirror are the ones which were pointed by Bourdin's estate in the lawsuit. The lawsuit named Madonna, Warner Bros. Records, and Mondino as defendants. The details presented in the lawsuit read as: [...] "Factors such as composition, background, wardrobe, lighting, narrative, camera angle, decor, and objects depicted are strikingly similar... There are very few scenes or sequences in the 'Hollywood' video that are not directly derived from the Bourdin works." [...] Details of the financial settlement are confidential, and Madonna acknowledged no wrongdoing in her liberal appropriation of the images. Bourdin's lawyer, John Koegel, said the parties reached a [...] "very, very successful settlement", adding that terms of the deal did not allow him to discuss exact dollar amounts. In 2011, news website Independent Online disclosed the settled amount by Madonna to be $600,000.|$|E

The spin-off lasted one season. The first episode of the spin-off, [...] "Switching Channels", features a crossover between the two shows via <b>a</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "TV dinner" [...] {{supposedly}} {{came from}} {{the shape of the}} tray it was served on. The main meal was in a bigger compartment {{on one side of the}} tray and the vegetables lined up in smaller compartments on the other side. The arrangement was similar to that of the front panels of a 1950s television set: a screen on the left and speakers and control on the right. There were other theories about the name of the TV dinner. One reason was that early packaging featured the image of <b>a</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set.</b> Another was that it was marketed a quick alternative to traditional cooking and could be consumed by families at dinnertime while watching TV, a popular pastime in the fifties.|$|E

He also released a single in 1973, [...] "Thinking" [...] with B-side [...] "There is Love" [...] which features Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin on guitar. Bizarrely, the British release, with considerable airplay of [...] "Giving it All Away" [...] (first lines [...] "I paid all my dues so I picked up my shoes, I {{got up and walked}} away") coincided with news reports of The Who being sued for unpaid damage to their hotel on a recent tour, including <b>a</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set</b> being thrown out of the window.|$|E
2500|$|The series {{earned a}} very loyal {{audience}} in the first season. It was so devoted, some people were reported to take <b>a</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set</b> with them {{if they had to}} be away from home, so they would not miss an episode (as home video recording did not yet exist). However, the second season fared rather poorly in the Nielsen ratings after moving from Monday to Saturday night, going against Jackie Gleason. Producer Joseph Stefano chose to leave the show after the first year; he realized that competing against the more popular Gleason would kill his show (proven by its cancellation midway through the second season). However, the series retained a following for many years after its original broadcast. Many decades later, horror writer Stephen King called it [...] "the best program of its type ever to run on network TV." ...|$|E
2500|$|Until {{the passage}} of the Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990, {{television}} captioning was performed by a set-top box manufactured by Sanyo Electric and marketed by the National Captioning Institute (NCI). (At that time a set-top decoder cost about as much as <b>a</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set</b> itself, approximately $200.) Through discussions with the manufacturer it was established that the appropriate circuitry integrated into the television set would be less expensive than the stand-alone box, and Ronald May, then a Sanyo employee, provided the expert witness testimony on behalf of Sanyo and Gallaudet University in support of {{the passage of}} the bill. On January 23, 1991, the Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990 was passed by Congress. [...] This Act gave the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) power to enact rules on the implementation of Closed Captioning. This Act required all analog television receivers with screens of at least 13inches or greater, either sold or manufactured, {{to have the ability to}} display closed captioning by July 1, 1993.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, a {{commission}} chaired by Sir Thomas Legg demanded Murphy repay £577.46 in expenses {{which he had}} overclaimed. He did not appeal, and repaid the money in full. Expenses documents made available showed he also claimed over one million pounds between 2001 and 2012. In 2007/8 he claimed £3,900 for food, £2,284 for petty cash and £4,884 for a new bathroom. He claimed £249 for <b>a</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set</b> and a further £99 for a TV stand; £1762.50 of taxpayers money paid for Murphy's website whilst further claims included Labour party adverts in the local press. He claimed almost £2000 of public cash to pay private accountants to handle his tax returns. In 2012 Murphy was {{among a group of}} 27 MPs named as benefiting from up to £20,000 per year expenses to rent accommodation in London, {{at the same time as}} letting out property they owned in the city. Although the practice did not break rules, it has been characterised as a [...] "loophole" [...] that allows politicians to profit from Commons allowances. He also designated his constituency home in Glasgow as his second home for which he claimed £780 a month in mortgage interest payments in 2007/8. Murphy had previously apologised [...] "on behalf of all politicians" [...] for the expenses scandal in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|On May 1, 1988, The Movie Channel debuted its [...] "eye and profile" [...] logo, which {{utilized}} various designs incorporating facial expressions, {{with the}} channel's name rendered in Helvetica Extended on tilted black bars {{at the top}} and bottom of the logo; some viewers have commented on online blogs and video websites such as YouTube that this logo, due to the eyes being prominently displayed, had frightened them as young children (this logo was replicated somewhat when WGN America used a logo featuring a set of female eyes rimmed with green mascara from 2008 to 2009). The channel ran different and unique feature presentation opens and network IDs during the nine-year period it was in use (among which included intros in which the logo changed facial expressions at the draw of a curtain, set to a bouncy keyboard tune; a grayscale version of the logo – which then winked – rotating to face the screen in front of a gray background accompanied by a steady drumbeat; and a live-action/partially computer-animated sequence set to Indiana Jones-style adventure music in which the logo shoots lasers from its eyes to escape from the newspaper it is printed on – which is set afire as kindling in a fireplace – and embarks on a calamity-filled journey through a family's living room, seen from its point of view, as it heads toward the safety of <b>a</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set</b> it rappels into on a cable hooked up to a wall outlet above the fireplace's mantle).|$|E
2500|$|The former {{hotel has}} been called the [...] "birthplace of cable {{television}}". In 1948, the Hotel Astoria was the site of the [...] "world's first cable television system", invented by L. E. [...] "Ed" [...] Parsons, then owner of Astoria radio station KAST. Ed Parsons set up the first U.S. cable television system to use coaxial cable and a community antenna to deliver TV signals to an area that otherwise {{would not have been able}} to receive broadcast TV signals. [...] The first television station in the Pacific Northwest was inaugurated in November 1948 by Seattle radio station KRSC, now KING-TV. [...] Astoria being about [...] from Seattle, Parsons [...] "was unable to get a picture in his apartment, even with a high antenna". His apartment was located across the street from the eight-story Hotel Astoria, and with permission from the hotel's manager he set up an antenna on the building's roof and ran coaxial cable from there to his apartment. [...] The set-up worked, and Parsons and his wife were the only people in Astoria able to view television, starting on Thanksgiving Day 1948. [...] "Reception was not of a quality that would be saleable today," [...] Parsons told The Oregonian in 1972, [...] "but we received a picture and started attracting guests." [...] The couple quickly became overwhelmed by requests from friends and neighbors eager to pay them a visit to experience the new medium. To appease them, Parsons laid a second cable to <b>a</b> <b>TV</b> <b>set</b> in the hotel's lobby, and by the end of December a nearby music store was the third hook-up. [...] Parsons then began setting up cable television connections to area households, with 25 receiving the service by mid-March 1949 and 100 by July. Some time later, Parsons moved his community antenna from the roof of the Hotel Astoria to a separate location elsewhere in town and also added a second antenna site.|$|E
