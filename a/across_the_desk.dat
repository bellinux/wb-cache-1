2500|$|Frank puts Leigh {{back in his}} solitary cell. Mary Eunice 'predicts' that Frank has {{had trouble}} with Leigh and slices Frank's throat with the {{straight}} razor. She feigns worrying about a rampage as Leigh maniacally laughs. In the office, Jude prays for guidance and strength. The door opens and she sees Leigh enter. When asked, {{he says he is}} there to open his [...] "present." [...] Mary Eunice locks the door from the outside and Arden affirms his loyalty to her. Arden leaves to take Grace's body in a cart down the death chute, so the Raspers can dispose of her. Along the way, he is stunned by a bright light and a deafening sound. He regains his senses to find an empty cart and missing Grace. In the office, Leigh reminds Jude of her cruelty to him by caning her <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> He intends on raping her but she stabs him in the neck with a letter opener.|$|E
2500|$|Outside, Neff {{waits for}} Nino to arrive (something Neff had orchestrated). Neff advises {{him not to}} enter the house and instead go to Lola, the woman who loves him. Nino is reluctantly {{convinced}} and leaves as told. Neff drives to his office and starts speaking into his Dictaphone, as seen at the film's opening. Keyes arrives unnoticed and hears enough to know the truth. Keyes sadly tells him, [...] "Walter, you're all washed up." [...] Neff tells Keyes {{he is going to}} Mexico rather than face the gas chamber, but sags to the floor from his injury and blood loss before he can reach the elevator. A weakened Neff tells Keyes that the reason why he could not figure the case out was that the guy whom he was looking for was [...] "too close, right <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> from you." [...] When Keyes replies [...] "closer than that, Walter." [...] Neff replies that he loves Keyes too. As Neff had done, lighting Keyes' cigars for him throughout the film, Keyes lights Neff's cigarette as they await the police and an ambulance.|$|E
60|$|Peter Phipps {{pushed the}} cigars <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> towards his companion.|$|E
6000|$|I {{followed}} him. Still frowning, he went <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> {{and took}} out a small pack of patience cards. Then he drew up a chair to the table, and, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses! ...|$|R
50|$|In June 2012, {{during a}} live talk show, Kanelli was struck {{three times in}} the {{shoulders}} and the face by Golden Dawn spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris. Kanelli pushed him away after Kasidiaris threw water <b>across</b> <b>the</b> news <b>desk</b> at another guest.|$|R
60|$|Fanny, after {{following}} a few steps, stops and thinks. Ernest has entered with the wood. He is piling {{it in the}} basket by the fire. His entrance decides her. She glances {{through the open door}} of the dressing-room, then flies <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> seats herself, and begins feverishly to write a telegram.|$|R
60|$|Dredlinton leaned <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> There was {{an almost}} satyrlike grin upon his face.|$|E
60|$|Three {{days later}} Joseph Dixon slid a closed-circuit message plate <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> to his boss.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Holder {{did not trust}} himself to reply. He looked down <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> at the financier, who was fumbling with the leaves.|$|E
60|$|The {{action of}} the drama had just brought that {{emotional}} lady on left centre and had taken her <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> which stood {{on the other side}} of <b>the</b> stage. <b>The</b> <b>desk</b> was an important feature of the play, for it symbolized the absorption in business which, exhibited by her husband, was rapidly breaking Miss Hobson's heart. He loved his desk better than his young wife, that was what it amounted to, and no wife can stand that sort of thing.|$|R
6000|$|Holmes walked <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> and dabbed {{a little}} ink from each bottle {{on to the}} {{blotting}} paper. [...] "It was not printed in this room," [...] he said; [...] "this is black ink and the other purplish. It was done by a thick pen, and these are fine. No, it was done elsewhere, I should say. Can you make anything of the inscription, Ames?" ...|$|R
60|$|When he {{went back}} to his post, a few groups, looking very small, were {{creeping}} in by transept doors--by favour, like herself: then a little white figure flitted <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> <b>desks,</b> opened and marked the books, took up something, and disappeared; and in another moment Lance, in his broad white folds, was at her side. 'Here's the music. Oh, you have it! I've seen Fee,' he whispered; 'they are at Mrs. Harewood's, all right!' and he was gone.|$|R
60|$|His fare came {{forth with}} the Casino dreamy smile still on her plain face. Jerry {{took her by}} the arm and led her into the police station. A gray-moustached {{sergeant}} looked keenly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> He and the cabby were no strangers.|$|E
6000|$|As {{they reached}} {{the foot of the}} stairs, the old one, the night clerk leaned <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> and, in a voice that took the whole office into the conversation, quizzed, [...] "Come from New York, eh? Well, you're quite a ways from home." ...|$|E
60|$|Austen Vane {{leaned forward}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> and even Mr. Flint (if the truth were known) recoiled {{a little before}} the anger he had aroused. It shot forth from Austen's eyes, proclaimed itself in the {{squareness}} of the face, and vibrated in every word he spoke.|$|E
5000|$|McClard is most {{noted for}} his [...] "Pianodesks". He {{made his first}} Pianodesk {{in the summer of}} 1996 for a friend while living in Benton, Illinois. <b>The</b> first <b>desk</b> was so well {{received}} that he then made a 2nd for another friend. Since that time he has made desks that have sold all <b>across</b> <b>the</b> United States and bass guitars that have sold all <b>across</b> <b>the</b> World. <b>Desk</b> 7 http://www.pianodesk.com/hollydsk.htm sits in the bungalows at Warner Bros. Studios and is used to hold an Oscar and Emmy Award for one of the original X-Files producers. McClard's pianodesks have been featured in magazines such as Business 2.0 and in countless newspapers and Television news stories. McClard's web site, www.pianodesk.com http://www.pianodesk.com, features all of his woodworking projects.|$|R
60|$|He {{wondered}} {{whether he had}} managed to keep his voice steady, its tone unconcerned enough; for his emotion was strong though {{it had nothing to do}} with the business aspect of this suggestion. He moved in the room in vague preparation for departure, when he heard a soft laugh. He spun about quickly with a frown, but the Editor was not laughing at him. He was chuckling <b>across</b> <b>the</b> big <b>desk</b> at <b>the</b> wall: a preliminary of some speech for which Renouard, recalled to himself, waited silent and mistrustful.|$|R
60|$|Doubtless {{it helped}} Mr. Ross in {{maintaining}} his sublimity {{to dress like}} a cleric--black, modest suits of straight lines, white shirts, small, black ties. But he also wore silk socks, which he reflectively scratched while he was dictating. He was of an elegance in linen handkerchiefs, in a chased-gold cigarette-case, in cigarettes with a monogram. Indeed, he often stopped during dictation to lean <b>across</b> <b>the</b> enormous mahogany <b>desk</b> and explain to Una {{how much of a}} connoisseur he was in tennis, fly-casting, the ordering of small, smart dinners at the Plaza.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] he said. [...] "I can't {{pretend to}} account for these astounding views you have acquired--and I am using a mild term. Let me say this: (he leaned forward a little, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk)</b> I demand that you be specific. I am a busy man, I have little time to waste, I have certain matters--before me which must be {{attended}} to to-night. I warn you that I will not listen any longer to vague accusations." ...|$|E
6000|$|Owe him! thought I--what do I owe him but a grudge, but I {{concealed}} my resentment; and presently he said, [...] "By {{running away}} from the ship in Liverpool, you forfeited your wages, which amount to twelve dollars; and as there has been advanced to you, in money, hammers, and scrapers, seven dollars and seventy-five cents, you are therefore indebted to me in precisely that sum. Now, young gentleman, I'll {{thank you for the}} money;" [...] and he extended his open palm <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{you mind}} about that," [...] Mr. Tooting replied. [...] "The more {{advertising}} you get, the better, and {{this shows that}} the right people are behind you. Mrs. Pomfret's a smart woman, all right. She knows her job. And here's more advertising," [...] he continued, shoving another sheet <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> [...] "a fine likeness of you in caricature labelled, 'Ajax defying the Lightning.' Who's Ajax? There was an Italian, a street contractor, with that name--or something like it--in Newcastle {{a couple of years}} ago--in the eighth ward." ...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{friendly}} conflict between field broadcast journalists and broadcast journalism instructors. The conflict {{centers on the}} development of best instructional practices for the student journalists. This qualitative study is an attempt {{to bridge the gap between}} field journalists and journalism instructors. To accomplish this goal, first, a review of the academic literature was conducted to establish a research base. Then, interviews were conducted with field broadcast journalists (n = 4) to answer the following guiding research question: According to field broadcast journalists, what knowledge, skills, and training are required when transitioning from MC student into professional broadcast journalist? This study presents the findings of these interviews. Areas of focus are technology, internships, and student motivation. The study concludes with a discussion of academic advisory groups. However, the ultimate goal of the study is to get the two groups talking rather than scowling at each other from <b>across</b> <b>the</b> news <b>desk...</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I know, I know," [...] {{interrupted}} Miss Ramsbotham, who of late, {{among other}} failings new to her, {{had developed a}} tendency towards impatience; [...] "but she gets all that in {{half a dozen other}} papers. I have thought it out." [...] Miss Ramsbotham leaned further <b>across</b> <b>the</b> editorial <b>desk</b> and sunk her voice unconsciously to a confidential whisper. [...] "Tell her the coming fashions. Discuss the question whether hat or bonnet makes you look the younger. Tell her whether red hair or black is to be the new colour, what size waist is being worn by the best people. Oh, come!" [...] laughed Miss Ramsbotham in answer to Peter's shocked expression; [...] "one cannot reform the world and human nature all at once. You must appeal to people's folly in order to get them to listen to your wisdom. Make your paper a success first. You can make it a power afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't need an excuse," [...] {{she told}} him. He moved toward her, {{but she took}} a paper from <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> and carried it to a file <b>across</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|R
60|$|Carrier {{interposed}} with {{a coarse}} imprecation. He suddenly leaned forward, sprawling right <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> A {{shaft of light}} from between the damask curtains caught {{the end of his}} nose and the tip of his protruding chin, distorting his face and making it seem grotesque as well as hideous in the dim light. He appeared excited and inflated with vanity. He always gloried in the atrocities which he committed, and though he professed to look with contempt on every one of his colleagues, he was always glad of an opportunity to display his inventive powers before them, and to obtain their fulsome eulogy.|$|E
60|$|Harris {{pushed the}} card aside and stared {{back up at}} the youth <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> from him. The young man seemed ill at ease and {{appeared}} to be avoiding answering the question Harris had put to him. Harris frowned. Westerburg was a good-looking chap, actually handsome in his Patrol uniform, a shock of blond hair over one eye. He was tall, almost six feet, a fine healthy lad, just two years out of Training, according to the card. Born in Detroit. Had measles when he was nine. Interested in jet engines, tennis, and girls. Twenty-six years old.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a rest ye need, I've {{been wanting}} to say it." [...] McCrae took a step forward, {{and for a moment}} it seemed as though he were at last about to break the bonds of his reserve. Perhaps he {{detected}} an instinctive shrinking on the rector's part. At any rate, there was another instant of silence, in which the two men faced each other <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> and McCrae held out his hand. [...] "Good luck to ye," [...] he said, as Hodder took it, [...] "and don't have the pariah on your mind. Stay till ye're rested, and come back to us." ...|$|E
60|$|The rector {{held his}} hand <b>across</b> <b>the</b> side of <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> where <b>the</b> skull was and Stephen, placing his hand in it for a moment, felt a cool moist palm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't I help?" [...] asked Boardman, keeping {{away from}} the sad {{memorials}} of Dan's love strewn about on <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> and yet not able to keep his eyes off them <b>across</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|R
60|$|<b>Across</b> <b>the</b> {{room from}} him Tarzan saw Olga seated before a little desk on which stood her telephone. She was tapping impatiently upon the {{polished}} surface of <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> She {{had not heard}} him enter.|$|R
6000|$|He threw {{aside the}} letter. [...] "I'll {{tell you what}} I want you to do," [...] he said. [...] "It's nothing to object to. Tell him that you've seen me and had a talk. I {{understand}} his scheme {{to be that the}} country should grow more and more food until it eventually becomes self-supporting; and that the Government should control the distribution. Tell him that with that I'm heart and soul in sympathy; and would like to help him." [...] He pushed aside a pile of papers and, leaning <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> spoke with studied deliberation. [...] "If he can see his way to making his policy dependent upon Protection, we can work together." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{tossed a}} franc to him <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> By {{the terms of}} my {{contract}} with him, you understand, he was entitled to ten per cent, of every profit accruing from the business in lieu of wages, but in this instance do you not think that I was justified in looking on one franc now, and perhaps twenty when the transaction was completed, as a more than just honorarium for his share in it? Was I not taking all the risks in this delicate business? Would it be fair for me {{to give him a}} hundred francs for sitting quietly in the office or sipping absinthe at a neighbouring bar whilst I risked New Orleans--not to speak of the gallows? ...|$|E
60|$|Tommy shot a swift glance <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> and for {{the first}} time saw the whole of him. He was clad in a threadbare, long, brown ulster--long, that is, it would have been upon an {{ordinary}} man, but the stranger happening to be remarkably tall, it appeared on him ridiculously short, reaching only to his knees. Round his neck and tucked into his waistcoat, thus completely hiding the shirt and collar he may have been wearing or may not, was carefully arranged a blue silk muffler. His hands, which were bare, looked blue and cold. Yet the black frock-coat and waistcoat and French grey trousers bore the unmistakable cut of a first-class tailor and fitted him to perfection. His hat, which he had rested on the desk, shone resplendent, and the handle of his silk umbrella was an eagle's head in gold, with two small rubies for the eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>Across</b> <b>the</b> room, {{between two}} windows, stood a flat-topped desk. A little pile {{of white and}} brown lay upon it close to the {{opposite}} edge. After a moment of rest I crossed the room to investigate. The white was the bleached human bones--the skull, collar bones, arms, {{and a few of}} the upper ribs of a man. The brown was the dust of a decayed military cap and blouse. In a chair before <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> were other bones, while more still strewed the floor beneath <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> and about <b>the</b> chair. A man had died sitting there with his face buried in his arms--two hundred years ago.|$|R
6000|$|We had {{not long}} to search, {{if to prove}} that Job Lord had been acting {{as a tool for}} the Britishers was our only aim. On the top of <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> {{as if it had been}} but lately placed there, was a folded paper, and when Hiram opened it eagerly I read these words <b>across</b> <b>the</b> top: ...|$|R
60|$|With a wide {{gesture of}} her ever-moving arms the actress waved back the little group of spectators, leaving {{a space in}} front of <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> for <b>the</b> scene of her vindication or fall. Then she whipped off her long tan cloak and tossed it <b>across</b> <b>the</b> arm of the {{policeman}} who still stood officially among them.|$|R
