30|$|Several studies (Roulet et al. 1998, Artaxo et al. 2000, Carmouze et al. 2002, Muresan 2006) {{have shown}} that Hg levels in Amazonian soils are high {{compared}} to temperate zones, mainly due to soil pedogenesis and high atmospheric depositions. Thus the soils constitute an important reservoir of naturally accumulated Hg that can be mobilized through naturel or <b>anthropic</b> <b>erosion</b> (deforestation, gold-mining) and induce increased export of terrestrial Hg to aquatic ecosystems.|$|E
40|$|An {{inventory}} of the <b>anthropic</b> <b>erosion</b> in the Tlalpujahua river basin, based upon an applied geomorphological approach, is presented 16 % of the metamorphic terrain and 4. 5 % of the volcanic terrain are severely eroded. as a whole, 5 % of the catchment is badly affected. Most of the erosion processes occurs in areas of accumulation, in ondulating terrains, gently sloping to sloping, with moderately deep to deep clayey soils. The main differentiating factor among the erosion patterns in the volcanic and non volcanic terrains is the slope hydrology (superficial flows in the metamorphics vs subsuperficial flows in the volcanics) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} multidisciplinary {{study was}} applied to three watersheds inside the national park of Belluno Dolomites (Veneto region, Northern Italy) to verify experimentally the hydrological and ecological effects on river base-flow regime and fluvial functionality of water abstraction for energy supply. For a total of 15 sites (13 river sections and 2 main head-water springs), located upstream and downstream of main water abstraction plants, a hydrological (whole year) and ecological (growing season) monitoring scheme has been applied during 2006 - 2007. Minimum Acceptable Flow (MAF) was calculated through different empirical and analytical tools and compared with monitoring results. A high resilience of river ecosystems in response to water abstraction was highlighted; indeed major ecological effects were due to other factors, either of <b>anthropic</b> (preventing <b>erosion</b> weirs) or natural (geomorphology of river bed) origin...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRiverbanks are characterised by {{high levels}} of both species-richness and <b>anthropic</b> pressure. <b>Erosion</b> {{controls}} on riverbanks often involve installations to protect human investments (i. e. buildings, public amenitiesetc.). However, whether such installations can accommodate natural biodiversity has not been well assessed and subsequently seldom {{taken into account in}} the choice of technique. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess animal and plant species diversity on the natural gradient of various riverbank protection systems, from entirely stone riprap, through combined constructions (mixing riprap and bioengineering), to purely vegetative bioengineering structures. We compared plant species diversity and animal taxonomic diversity above ground (beetles) and below ground (mites) on five installations in each category. Vegetation was sampled along three longitudinal transects using the point contact method. Fauna were sampled in the soil, air and herbaceous layers by trapping (yellow bowl trap, pitfalls and Berlese-Tullgren extractor). The fifteen sites sampled were located in the Rhône-Alpes region (South East France). 148 plant species, 78 beetle genera and 8 mite families were recorded. We found a significantly lower animal and plant diversity in riprap constructions than in the other two types. Surprisingly, diversity was higher, even if not significantly, in combined works than in purely vegetative ones. Furthermore, riprap techniques were more subject to exotic invasions than techniques using bioengineering. This study gives new insights into the animal and plant biodiversity of riverbank protections against erosion, ranging from entirely mineral to purely vegetative constructions. It also provides useful information to help practitioners choose techniques in relation to their future impact on biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|As a zoonosis, Plague {{is also an}} {{ecological}} entity, a complex system of ecological interactions between the pathogen, the hosts, and the spatiotemporal variations of its ecosystems. Five reservoir system models have been proposed: (i) assemblages of small mammals with different levels of susceptibility and roles in the maintenance and amplification of the cycle; (ii) species-specific chronic infection models; (ii) flea vectors as the true reservoirs; (iii) Telluric Plague, and (iv) a metapopulation arrangement for species with a discrete spatial organization, following a source-sink dynamic of extinction and recolonization with naïve potential hosts. The diversity of the community that harbors the reservoir system affects the transmission cycle by predation, competition, and dilution effect. Plague has notable environmental constraints, depending on altitude (500 + meters), warm and dry climates, and conditions for high productivity events for expansion of the transmission cycle. Human impacts are altering Plague dynamics by altering landscape and the faunal composition of the foci and adjacent areas, usually increasing the presence and number of human cases and outbreaks. Climatic change is also affecting the range of its occurrence. In the current transitional state of zoonosis as a whole, Plague is at risk of becoming a public health problem in poor countries where ecosystem <b>erosion,</b> <b>anthropic</b> invasion of new areas, and climate change increase the contact of the population with reservoir systems, giving new urgency for ecologic research that further details its maintenance in the wild, the spillover events, and how it links to human cases...|$|R
30|$|Is crucial the {{information}} of the antecedent precipitations, since a 24  h rainfall event {{is not enough}} to trigger landslides (Pagano et al. 2010). For example, during Hurricane Ida (2009) several sand/silt/debris flowslide/debris avalanche were initiated in the scarps of Ilopango Caldera (covered by TBJ, Figs.  4, 5), but for the event DT 12 E (2011) there were not landslides observed, in spite having more accumulated rain (24  h) than Hurricane Ida. These recent landslides that have taken place mostly close to Ilopango Caldera, might be connected with a large volume of material in the streams ready to be mobilized or to deposits in the bed stream that is impacted by smaller landslide mass (drained or undrained loading) producing fluidization (Hungr et al. 2013). In addition, a time of preparation for <b>anthropic,</b> <b>erosion</b> mechanical and chemical weathering processes might be needed to set the next failure area and accumulation of deposits inside the drainage systems.|$|E
40|$|The sediments {{resulting}} {{of natural}} or <b>anthropic</b> <b>erosion</b> are deposited {{on the soil}} surface and around the trunks of trees occurring in riparian forests. For assessment of the erosion, tree-rings of roots and stems were analyzed. Guarea guidonea trees from a riparian forest affected by the sedimentation of soil erosion from pastures and soybean fields in state of Goias were selected. Wood samples were extracted through a non-destructive method at three heights from trunks of trees located in three positions (top, middle and bottom) of a riparian slope. The evaluation revealed a deposition of a thick sediment layer up to 34 cm {{around the base of}} tree trunks during the past 24 years. The inter-correlations between the tree-rings widths present in wood samples at the base and at 50 and 100 cm from Guarea guidonea tree trunks presented low, medium and high values. These values resulted from the low tree-rings distinctiveness in the wood; the absence of some rings as well as the eccentricity of the pith. The analyses of dendrogeomorphology allowed the determination of the date of seed germination and tree growth and inference on the periods of sediment deposition in the trunk of the trees...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Anthropic, or man-induced erosion can be {{recognized}} on Canterbury's mountain land. Almost {{all of it}} is identical in form and mode of origin to other erosion types, and may be indistinguishable unless obviously associated with roads, tracks, or fences. In particular, where vegetation is destroyed or impaired by fire or grazing, it is impossible to separately identify anthropic and natural components of the erosion. Early surveys reported significant <b>anthropic</b> <b>erosion</b> throughout the region. Subsequent work has revealed some errors in methodology, but more importantly it allows the human influence to be viewed in context with the more significant and more extensive natural erosion. The highest sediment yields and erosion rates in Canterbury are within the wetter, and in some places well-forested, areas near the main divide, rather than in the drier, depleted eastern ranges. Some barren screes have changed little over centuries, and even very active unstable screes may be old landforms. Soil stratigraphy reveals a long history of episodic stability and instability. Dated charcoals provide a fire history spanning more than 40, 000 yr. More frequent fires between 500 and 1000 yr ago brought widespread deforestation. There probably were regional increases in erosion while forest soils adjusted to loss of tree-root strength. Early pastoralists further increased the frequency of fires and grazed sheep, greatly modifying the grass- and shrub-land vegetation in both stature and composition. Erosion rates would have increased because sheet erosion is more than 10 times greater from bare soils than from those with intact tussock, scrub...|$|E
40|$|The Beg-er-Vil coastal site (Quiberon, Morbihan, France), {{initially}} excavated in the 1980 s, {{and more}} extensively since 2012, {{is exposed to}} strong marine and <b>anthropic</b> <b>erosion.</b> At the present time, the main challenge is to define {{the status of the}} site by describing its formation dynamics. This necessitates investigating the taphonomic and erosive mechanisms using a combined method adapted to the shell midden levels, before undertaking spatial analysis. The archaeological level is protected by a thick dune and is subdivided into several stratigraphic units (SU), which record several changes in the function of the site. It is made up of accumulations of shell pockets covered in sandy sediments. The micromorphological analysis shows that this waste area seems to develop into an area of activities and movement. These surfaces also record alternating dry and wet seasonal conditions, but with no phase of abandonment. Systematic pH measurements show variations of 7. 7 to 9. 0 depending on the layers, corresponding to a slightly alkaline to alkaline acid-basic status. The mapping of measurements can be correlated to structures and archaeological remains of organic origin. The excavation shows that the division of the dwelling area was guided by topographic factors, with a circular dwelling 3. 50 m in diameter installed on a flat zone and a shell waste zone on a slope towards the sea. Numerous fire-related activities were also carried out in this zone (pits, hearths). Spatial analysis by GIS shows a high concentration of recorded objects (lithics, bones, shells) {{to the west of the}} excavated area, in the shell level. Marine erosion is the main erosive factor limiting our knowledge of the site. The distance to the coastline was estimated after reconstruction of the relative sea level during the Holocene using the “Sea-Level Index Points” (SLIPs) methodology. Three SLIPs indicate a relative sealevel position between − 15. 5 m and − 11 m and a foreshore area at a depth between − 7. 15 and − 14. 02 m around 6200 BCE. This paleogeographic reconstruction approach indicates that the site of Beg-er-Vil was located a few hundred to a few kilometres from the coastline. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
