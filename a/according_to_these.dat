5|$|Jose Brandao, a {{historian}} specializing in North American Native history, suggests that contemporary {{analyses of the}} Lachine Massacre continue to demonstrate cultural bias.

Brandao dismisses this theory as a largely ethnocentric interpretation with little evidence to support it.

5|$|The {{back was}} also reconstructed {{in a more}} or less {{horizontal}} orientation by Borsuk-Białynicka, which was followed by most subsequent depictions. In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55–65°, much steeper than previously thought, resulting in an elevated shoulder region. With the vertebral column of the trunk and neck held in a relatively straight line, this would result in an elevated position of the head.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{beliefs are}} one {{possible}} source {{for understanding the}} symbolism in the mysteries of Isis. J. Gwyn Griffiths, an Egyptologist and classical scholar, extensively studied Book 11 of Metamorphoses and its possible Egyptian background. He pointed out similarities between the first initiation in Metamorphoses and Egyptian afterlife beliefs, saying that the initiate took {{on the role of}} Osiris by undergoing symbolic death. In his view, the imagery of the initiation refers to the Egyptian underworld, the Duat. Griffiths argued that the sun {{in the middle of the}} night, in Lucius' account of the initiation, might have been influenced by the contrasts of light and dark in other mystery rites, but it derived mainly from the depictions of the underworld in ancient Egyptian funerary texts. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> texts, the sun god Ra passes through the underworld each night and unites with Osiris to emerge renewed, just as deceased souls do.|$|E

5|$|For an {{ecosystem}} to support ticks, it must satisfy two requirements: the population density of host {{species in the}} area must be high enough, and humidity must be high enough for ticks to remain hydrated. Due to their role in transmitting Lyme disease, ixodid ticks, particularly the North American I.scapularis, have been studied using geographic information systems to develop predictive models for ideal tick habitats. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> studies, certain features of a given microclimate – such as sandy soil, hardwood trees, rivers, {{and the presence of}} deer – were determined to be good predictors of dense tick populations.|$|E
5|$|In Krishna charitas, Krishna is born to Devaki and her husband, Vasudeva of the Chandravanshi clan. Devaki's {{brother is}} a tyrant named Kamsa. At Devaki's wedding, {{according}} to Puranic legends, Kamsa is told by fortune tellers {{that a child}} of Devaki would kill him. Kamsa arranges to kill all of Devaki's children. When Krishna is born, Vasudeva secretly carries the infant Krishna away across the Yamuna and exchanges him. When Kamsa tries to kill the newborn, the exchanged baby appears as the Hindu goddess Durga, warning him that his death has arrived in his kingdom, and then disappears, according to the legends in the Puranas. Krishna grows up with Nanda and his wife Yasoda near modern-day Mathura. Two of Krishna's siblings also survive, namely Balarama and Subhadra, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> legends. The day of birth of Krishna is celebrated as Krishna Janmashtami.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of general relativity is that it {{can be applied to the}} universe as a whole. A key point is that, on large scales, our universe appears to be constructed along very simple lines: all current observations suggest that, on average, the structure of the cosmos should be approximately the same, regardless of an observer's location or direction of observation: the universe is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. Such comparatively simple universes can be described by simple solutions of Einstein's equations. The current cosmological models of the universe are obtained by combining these simple solutions to general relativity with theories describing the properties of the universe's matter content, namely thermodynamics, nuclear- and particle physics. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> models, our present universe emerged from an extremely dense high-temperature state –the Big Bang– roughly 14 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since.|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the layer pyramid allows it to be securely dated to the time span between the reigns of king Sekhemkhet and that of king Snofru, {{the founder of the}} 4th Dynasty. Rainer Stadelmann, Miroslav Verner and Jean-Philippe Lauer compare the {{architecture of}} the layer pyramid with that of the step pyramids of Djoser and Sekhemkhet, expecting the layer pyramid to have originally consisted of five steps, just as its near-contemporary predecessors. The layer pyramid exhibits at one site both complex developments concerning its substructures and simplifications concerning the building methods employed for the superstructure. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> egyptologists, the layer pyramid is a clearly advanced version of the buried pyramid of Sekhemkhet.|$|E
5|$|The custom {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1800, with subsequent accounts {{of it being}} produced into the early twentieth century. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>these,</b> the Mari Lwyd was a tradition performed at Christmas time by groups of men.

The team would carry the Mari Lwyd to local houses, where they would request entry {{through the medium of}} song. The householders would be expected to deny them entry, again through song, and the two sides would continue their responses to one another in this manner.
