The bass is built using <b>a</b> <b>VCR</b> casing {{and another one}} of their instruments has a jagged scythe {{at the end of}} it. They also play on custom made percussion instruments and electric lamellophones. Neptune began in 1994 as a student art project by sculptor/musician Jason Sanford. In 2006 Neptune signed with Table of the Elements, an experimental record label that also has performers such as Rhys Chatham, John Cale, and Captain Beefheart on its roster.|$|E

50|$|Getting {{the most}} benefit from S-VHS {{required}} a direct video {{connection to the}} monitor, ideally via an S-Video connection. However, older television sets lacked S-Video or even any AV inputs. Nevertheless, viewing an S-VHS recording through <b>a</b> <b>VCR's</b> built-in RF modulator yields a discernible quality improvement over VHS.|$|R
25|$|Inside, a key {{aspect of}} the crime scene was also {{inconsistent}} with the burglary theory. At {{the top of the stairs}} was a stack of stereo equipment atop <b>a</b> <b>VCR.</b> If, as the evidence suggested, the struggle between Rasmussen and her attacker had begun upstairs and then continued downstairs, that stack would likely have been knocked downstairs and scattered as well. It made more sense to assume that it had been stacked afterwards, when an actual burglar would have fled the scene immediately after the shooting.|$|E
25|$|Each {{cabin on}} the ship was {{completely}} pre-fabricated, with complete furnishing and soundproofing, and individually installed on board the ship. The ship was originally built with spacious cabins, all of which include illuminated closets, colour television and <b>a</b> <b>VCR,</b> with many cabins equipped with a bathtub. The 1999 refit added six suites {{in the place of}} former officers' cabins, while six balconies were added to the existing suites under the bridge wings. During the 2011/2012 refit, a small number of balcony cabins were created aft, while a considerable number of existing midships cabins were fitted with small French balconies.|$|E
25|$|The game {{presents}} the player's character design {{as being a}} self-made television stage talent or celebrity. It is a simple animation production studio which lets the user insert captured images such as human faces onto 3D models which had been made with Polygon Studio, dress up the models from an assortment of hundreds of clothes and accessories, and then animate the models with sound, music, and special effects. The player can connect an analog video source such as <b>a</b> <b>VCR</b> or camcorder to the Capture Cartridge and record movies on the Nintendo 64. A photograph of a person's face from a video source via the Capture Cassette or from the Game Boy Camera via the Transfer Pak, may be mapped onto the characters created in Polygon Studio and placed into movies created with Talent Studio.|$|E
50|$|Most VCR {{circuits}} use the {{amplitude of}} the {{vertical blanking pulse}} to operate the AGC. Video copy control schemes such as Macrovision exploit this, inserting spikes in the pulse which will be ignored by most television sets, but cause <b>a</b> <b>VCR's</b> AGC to overcorrect and corrupt the recording.|$|R
5000|$|M-Format {{also used}} a similar {{component}} video format {{to that used}} by Betacam, (as opposed to VHS's composite video format), and recorded at a much faster linear tape speed, as Betacam did.

25|$|In 2006, XM Satellite Radio was sued by the RIAA over XM's new {{portable}} devices the Inno and Helix. The RIAA claims these devices are {{equivalent to a}} downloading service, whereas XM contends the devices are protected under the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act. In July, XM requested that a federal judge dismiss the case. It {{should be noted that}} XM's subscribers can save only songs they hear on the radio and cannot request a specific song to be downloaded or program their radios to record specific artists. XM's {{portable devices}} allow the consumer to record a portion of their broadcast much like <b>a</b> <b>VCR,</b> DVR, or cassette player would allow. The content a subscriber records is available only while the subscriber still has an active account with XM Satellite Radio. Once the account is terminated, the recorded content will become inaccessible. Also, If a subscriber fails to listen to a total of 8 hours of programming a month, the recorded content will not be accessible. Recorded content can be accessed only on the portable device; it cannot be transferred to a home computer or separate digital music player.|$|E
25|$|When Nintendo {{released}} the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately {{different from that}} of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of <b>a</b> <b>VCR.</b> The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.|$|E
500|$|The first EyeTV {{hardware}} device {{was introduced in}} November 2002. It was a small USB-powered device that contained a cable tuner and hardware encoder in order to convert television video into an MPEG-1 format for watching on a computer. It also had coaxial and RCA plugs to connect it with <b>a</b> <b>VCR</b> or camcorder.

500|$|Powered by {{the same}} {{hardware}} used in the Sega Genesis, the physical shape of the Pico was designed to appear similar to a laptop. Included in the Pico are a stylus called the [...] "Magic Pen" [...] and a pad to draw on. Controlling the games for the system is accomplished either by using the Magic Pen like a mouse or by pressing the directional buttons on the console. The Pico does not include its own screen or RF output, and instead must be connected to a monitor through <b>a</b> <b>VCR</b> {{in order to be}} played. Touching the pen to the pad would either allow drawing or animate a character on the screen.|$|E

In his previous career, Pausch was {{associate professor in the}} Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia's School of Engineering and Applied Science in 1997 and 1998, and also worked for The Walt Disney Company as an imagineer and for Electronic Arts. At the University of Virginia, he {{was known for}} a lecture on the importance of making technology more friendly to users in which he demonstrated his point by presenting <b>a</b> <b>VCR</b> (other wise known as a video cassette recorder) that was hard to program and then smashing it with a sledgehammer. He was also known for his lecture on time management which he delivered in 1998 at the University of Virginia, and again in 2007 at the same venue. [...] "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams" [...] was the first lecture of the nine part [...] "Journeys" [...] lecture series conducted by Carnegie Mellon, which also included speakers such as Raj Reddy, Jay Apt, and Jared Cohon, the university president.

Both pleaded not guilty to the two charges and were later released on a $2,500 cash bond. At their arraignment, Assistant Attorney General John Grossman claimed that the two were trying to [...] "get attention by causing fear and unrest that there was a bomb in that location." [...] Michael Rich, the lawyer representing both men, disputed Grossman's claim, asserting that even <b>a</b> <b>VCR</b> could be found to fit the description of a bomb-like device. Judge Leary said that it would be necessary for the prosecution to demonstrate an intent on the part of the suspects to cause a panic. The judge continued, [...] "It appears the suspects had no such intent ... but the question should be discussed in a later hearing." [...] After making bail, Berdovsky and Stevens appeared for a live press conference. As Rich had advised them not to discuss the case, they spent the entire conference discussing and inviting press questions about hair styles of the 1970s, and ignoring any questions relating to the bomb scare.|$|E
