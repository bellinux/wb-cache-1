5|$|In May 2009, the Joint Working Party (JWP) of IUPAC {{published}} {{a report on}} the discovery of copernicium in which they acknowledged the discovery of the isotope 283Cn. This implied the discovery of flerovium, from the <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data for the synthesis of 287Fl and 291Lv, which decay to 283Cn. The discovery of the isotopes flerovium-286 and -287 was confirmed in January 2009 at Berkeley. This was followed by confirmation of flerovium-288 and -289 in July 2009 at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Germany. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 1999–2007. They found the early data inconclusive, but accepted the results of 2004–2007 as flerovium, and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} any <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mutual {{existence}} between the scriptores, only Flavius Vopiscus (ostensibly writing in 305 or 306) refers {{to any of}} the other authors (specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius). None of the other five demonstrate any awareness of the existence of any of their 'colleagues'. However, these references cause difficulties when these authors also address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also doing. For instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the Albinus, Maximini and Gordiani he addresses Constantine in a fashion that suggests he is writing after 306.|$|E

5|$|The Indian Princess is {{one example}} of an attempt by an artist of the early 19th Century to define an American {{national}} identity. Pocahontas, representing the spirit of America, literally shields Smith from injury and serves as foster mother, protecting colonists from famine and attack, achieving mythic status as a heroic mother, and preserving, nurturing and legitimizing America as a country. The play allows for an <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troubling aspects of the nation’s history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and brutality of the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its sense of self through the Pocahontas myth.|$|E

5|$|The British {{policy of}} salutary neglect for its North American colonies {{intended}} to minimise trade restrictions {{as a way}} of ensuring they stayed loyal to British interests. This permitted the development of the American Dream, a cultural spirit distinct from that of its European founders. The Thirteen Colonies of British America began an armed rebellion against British rule in 1775 when they rejected the right of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them without representation; they proclaimed their independence in 1776, and constituted the first thirteen states of the United States of America, which became a sovereign state in 1781 with the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. The 1783 Treaty of Paris represented Great Britain's formal <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States' sovereignty {{at the end of the}} American Revolutionary War.|$|E
5|$|According to Matteo Villani, Louis {{launched}} an expedition against the Golden Horde {{at the head}} of an army of 200,000 horsemen in April 1354. The young Tatar ruler, whom historian Iván Bertényi identified as Jani Beg, did not want to wage war against Hungary and agreed to sign a peace treaty. Although no other primary source mentioned that campaign and treaty, the Tatars made no plundering raids in Transylvania after 1354, which suggests that Villani's report is reliable. In the same year, Louis invaded Serbia, forcing Stefan Dušan to withdraw from the region along the river Sava. Under duress, Dušan initiated negotiations with the Holy See for <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> popes' primacy. The following year, Louis sent reinforcements to Casimir III to fight against the Lithuanians, and Hungarian troops supported Albert II, Duke of Austria, against Zürich. The Venetian delegates offered Louis 6–7,000 golden ducats as a compensation for Dalmatia, but Louis refused to give up his plan to reconquer the province. He signed an alliance with Albert II of Austria and Nicolaus of Luxemburg, Patriarch of Aquileia, against Venice. Upon his order, Croatian lords besieged and captured Klis, a Dalmatian fortress that Stefan Dušan's sister, Jelena, had inherited from her husband, Mladen Šubić.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, {{which gave the}} details of his sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Science {{is subject}} to a {{normative}} structure that includes how the contributions and interactions between scientists are rewarded. Authorship and citations have been the key elements within <b>the</b> reward system <b>of</b> science, whereas <b>acknowledgements,</b> despite being a well-established element in scholarly communication, have not received the same attention. This paper aims to put forward <b>the</b> bearing <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgements</b> in <b>the</b> humanities {{to bring to the}} foreground contributions and interactions that, otherwise, would remain invisible through traditional indicators of research performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study provides a comprehensive framework to understanding <b>acknowledgements</b> as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reward system with a special focus on its value in the humanities as a reflection <b>of</b> intellectual indebtedness. <b>The</b> distinctive features <b>of</b> research in <b>the</b> humanities are outlined and <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgements</b> as a source of contributorship information is reviewed to support these assumptions. Findings: Peer interactive communication is the prevailing support thanked in <b>the</b> <b>acknowledgements</b> <b>of</b> humanities, so <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgements</b> as super-citations can make special sense in this area. Since single-authored papers still predominate as publishing pattern in this domain, <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgements</b> might help to understand social interactions and intellectual influences that lie behind a piece of research and are not visible through authorship. Originality/value: Previous works have proposed and explored the prevailing acknowledgement types by domain. This paper focuses on the humanities to show <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgements</b> within <b>the</b> reward system and highlight publication patterns and inherent research features which make acknowledgements particularly interesting in the area as reflection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> socio-cognitive structure <b>of</b> research.
