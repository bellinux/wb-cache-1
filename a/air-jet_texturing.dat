30|$|One of the {{significant}} texturing processes in current use, <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing,</b> operates by mechanical interlocking and not by heat setting {{in the case of}} the other texturing techniques such as false-twist. It is a cold fluid texturing process that converts flat, continuous synthetic filament yarns into an entangled, convoluted, bulky, spun-like yarn. <b>Air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> has three types based on the supply yarn. Single-end <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> denotes the situation whereby single filament yarn is overfed to the texturing nozzle, and the resultant textured yarn is withdrawn. In case of parallel <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing,</b> two or more filaments yarns are fed at the same overfeed into the nozzle so as to facilitate a blend of different types of supply material, or of the same material but with different filament linear densities or number of filaments, or different cross sectional shapes. In core-effect <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> two different filament yarns are fed under different overfeeds into the air-jet at the same time. In core-effect <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing,</b> the lower overfeed yarn is called the core-yarn and the higher overfeed yarn is called the effect-yarn. The core-yarn overfeed determines the strength of the textured yarn. The effect-yarn overfeed determines the size of the protruded loops. It also has an indirect influence upon the number of loops per unit length and also on the linear density. Perhaps the most important influence of the effect-yarn overfeed is to be seen in the structure and appearance of the yarn. This is because loops are seen on the surface of the yarn in the same way that hairs are visible in a spun yarn. However, there is limited literature on core-effect <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> or the influence of the effect-yarn parameters on <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> performance. Researchers have not given adequate prominence in core-effect <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> and most of the research limited to single-end air-je texturing. Wickramasinghe (2003) has investigated the use of steam as an alternative fluid for air in spun-like textured yarn manufacturing and studied the performance of sewing threads manufactured using core-effect steam-jet textured yarns. He reported that steam could be used as an alternative fluid for air in manufacturing core-effect spun-like textured sewing threads.|$|E

(2013 a, 2013 b) used core-effect textured glass yarns for improving the bonding strength of laminated glass woven fabric composites and conclude that the <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> introduces bulk and loops in the yarn which provides more contact surface between the fibres and the resin.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{systematically}} {{investigates the}} effect of a number of geometric parameters on the texturing performance of <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> nozzles. In order to facilitate the research, an <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> nozzle with a rectangular cross section has been developed. The texturing performance of the nozzles is assessed by means of process observations and on-line measurement of stabilizing zone tension, and also by measuring the in creased linear density of the yams on textured yarn samples. Furthermore, instability, elongation at break, and tenacity are measured, and texturing quality is judged by visual inspections and examination of scanning electron microscopy images of the textured yarns. Tension in the stabilizing zone, increase in linear density, and to a somewhat lesser extent instability are reliable measures of texturing quality. The best texturing comes from nozzles with a slightly diverging main channel and a single air inlet hole located far from the nozzle exit. A curved diverging exit profile is essential for successful texturing. The results of the tests to determine {{the effect of}} air inlet angk are inconclusive and require further investigation...|$|E

Textile Research Journal, 64 (4), pp. 240 - 246. © SAGE. Reprinted {{by permission of}} SAGE Publications. <b>Air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> is a versatile process for producing a range of synthetic yarns with a spun-like appearance, which are widely used for apparel and furnishing fabrics and industrial textiles. There is no universal nozzle capable of processing any supply yam of any linear density. The role played by nozzle geometry is still not fully understood. The experimental study presented here seeks to compare air flow characteristics and texturing data for nine nozzles under realistic texturing conditions {{as a basis for}} an improved understanding of the effect of nozzle geometry. Compressed air consumption results show that the nozzle flow is choked at air inlets; thus the nozzles behave as converging-diverging passages. The exit flow distribution is approximately axisym metric in all cases. Nozzle exit flow characteristics are typical of underexpanded jets with a ratio of jet exit plane static pressure to ambient pressure smaller than or equal to approximately 2. Textured yams with varying visual appearance were produced by different nozzles under identical processing conditions. Nevertheless, the strength properties of the yams were broadly the same, as was their increase in linear density. Of all test variables, the tension in the stabilizing zone was the only quantity to show some promise as a correlating parameter with texturing quality. Neither the presence of shock waves in the exit region nor the magnitude of the exit zone velocity correlated with texturing effectiveness. The texturing results of these trials highlight the fact that the current descriptions of <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> are not fully capable of explaining the subtle effects due to nozzle geometry and can at best be described as incomplete...|$|E
30|$|In the beginning, air-jet {{textured}} yarns were produced by blowing {{a stream of}} air into twisted continuous filament yarns, while they were being overfed to the take-up bobbin (Wray & Entwistle 1968). Studies in the 1960 s by Wray and Entwistle (1969) were followed those by Sivakumar (1975) in the early 1970 s. Since 1980 s, researchers have mainly focused on investigating the effect of process parameters, nozzle geometry, and the air-flow behaviour on yarn texturing. Researchers (Acar 1988; Acar et al. 1986 b; Rangasamy et al. 1990) have studied the effect of filament fineness {{and concluded that the}} filaments with finer linear densities are more suitable for <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> due to their less bending and torsional stiffness that blow the filaments more easily that enhance the entanglement effectiveness. Supply yarn properties are important for texturing since resultant forces acting on filaments are determined by the fluid forces acting on the filaments (Acar 1991; Acar et al. 1986 b). Further Acar et al. (1986 c) found that the filament cross section also has direct influence on texturing and concluded that the non-circular filament cross sections have better filament texturing due to larger surface areas than the circular filament of equal linear density. Spin finish on filaments has a negative effect on the texturing process due to contamination of the texturing nozzle (Simmen 1987). However, researchers (Acar 1988; Acar & Demir 1987) dispute the above explanation and argued that most of the spin finish blow off from the filament due to the secondary air-low and the new jets are self cleaned. They suggest using a suitable spin-finish for <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> which removes them in filament wetting that improves the filament flexibility. Feeder yarn wetting was studied by many researchers (Acar & Demir 1987; Acar et al. 1986 d; Acar et al. 1986 a; Demir et al. 1988; Fisher & Wilson 1982; Kothari & Timble 1991) and reported that the feeder yarn wetting before the air-jet nozzle influence the stability of the texturing process as well as the textured yarn properties. Recent studies by Acar et al. (2006) reported that water acted as lubricant to reduce friction between the filaments in the <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> process. Study by Kothari et al. (1996) attempted to characterise the structure of air-jet {{textured yarns}} in terms of migration parameters. Since <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> process was developed to feed POY yarns, research were carried out by Sengupta et al. (1989) to understand the influence of drawing variables on the properties of air-jet textured yarns made from POY feeder yarns.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} of this research work {{was to investigate the}} use of steam as a substitute fluid for air in spun-like textured yarn manufacturing. The new substitute product holds the potential for competitive advantage, lower manufacturing costs and streamlined manufacturing capabilities. Generally high-pressure steam is known to be cheaper to produce than compressed air. An existing <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> machine was modified to supply either air or steam to the texturing nozzle. Using an identical nozzle, both air-jet and steam-jet textured yarns were manufactured. The influence of effect-yarn parameters on the steam-jet texturing performance has been studied. Furthermore, steam-jet texturing was compared with <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> in terms of the processing parameters and the textured yarn properties. The results show that spun-like textured yarn manufactured using steam has lower loop instability, lower loop density and higher tensile properties than air at comparable fluid pressures. SEM image analysis shows that the entangled structure of the steam-jet textured yarns is comparable to the air-jet textured yarns. To verify the commercial feasibility of the new product, sewing threads were manufactured using both steam-jet and air-jet textured yarns and tested for sewability under commercial specifications. Sewability results indicated that the steam-jet textured sewing threads can withstand sewing at high-speeds like air-jet textured threads and are therefore suitable for manufacture of sewing threads. Therefore, it can be concluded that steam can be used as an alternative fluid for air in making spun-like textured yarns.|$|E

Please note that this version does not contain the published papers and that where publisher permission has been given, the published papers {{are available from the}} Institutional Repository. This thesis describes original engineering research which aimed to establish fundamental understanding of various textile processes and to search for solutions to the associated problems. First, the particulars of the candidate are given, followed by a list of the publications included in the submission and the summary of each paper detailing the aims and achievements of the work. In this thesis, contributions in the following areas are described: 1. <b>Air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> and intermingling: this section, which contains nearly half of the papers, reports the research in the field of <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> of continuous filament yarns and intermingling of false-twist textured yarns. Theoretical and experimental investigations of the supersonic air flow, its interaction with the filament yarn and the effect of process parameters on the properties of the textured yarn are reported. This research established a clear understanding of the mechanism of the loop and entanglement formation in the <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> and the air-intermingling processes. Improvements to both processes have been suggested and more efficient and cost effective nozzles have been designed and evaluated. 2. Yarn characterisation: development of digital image processing and analysis techniques for objective, non-invasive and accurate assessment of the structural properties of the air-jet textured yarns is reported. The research has been extended to include the measurement of nip frequency and regularity of the air-intermingled yarns, as well as the yarn hairiness, evenness and twist of the conventional spun yarns. 3. 	Water-jet and thermal bonding of nonwovens: experimental research into the nonwoven fabric formation using very fine high-pressure water jets and modelling of the thermal bonding of fibrous webs by passing hot-air flow through them, mostly in collaboration with North Carolina State University, are reported. Models developed provide an essential tool for more efficient process, product and machine design. 4. 	Finally, this short section reports various other textile engineering research including the use of pulse lasers to fuse false-twist textured yarns to impart fused nodes (nips), the fibre opening, straightening and transportation using high-speed air flow in the open-end spinning process, and the design, development and construction of a novel circular warp knitting machine. The interrelationship between the publications is explained and reference to the work of the others in the field is given where appropriate. The contributions that the publications have made and the role that they played in advancing the knowledge in the research field and the impact they have made on other researchers are stated.

30|$|Theoretical {{investigation}} on nozzle parameters and air –flow on <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> {{was carried out}} by Acar et al. (1986 a, 1986 e); Bilgin et al. (1996); Demir et al. (1987), and Versteeg et al. (1994), but the actual behaviour of the filament during texturing in supersonic flow was not properly understood. Acar et al. (1986 b) have attempted to understand the actual filament behaviour during texturing using high speed photography techniques. Acar & Wray (1986) and Kothari & Timble (1991) investigated the effect of processing parameters such as jet type, overfeed ratio, air-pressure, production speed, yarn wetting and baffle-ball on yarn properties in terms of tensile properties, liner density and instability. Effect of baffle geometry and baffle setting was studied by Kothari et al. (1995) and found baffle parameters are critical to texturing and textured yarn properties.|$|E
30|$|A single {{position}} commercial <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> {{machine was}} modified to make both air-jet and steam-jet textured yarns under similar processing parameters. The machine has two feed rollers where the effect yarn overfeed {{can be changed}} from 37.9 % to 53.0 %. The machine was designed originally to supply compressed air to the texturing nozzle. At {{the start of the}} steam-jet texturing research, the machine was modified to supply either compressed air or high-pressure steam for the texturing nozzle. The jet box seal was modified to prevent steam and condensate from escaping. This also reduced the noise level and improved the safety of the steam process. Following process parameters, which are based on commercial specification in making 120 ticket number (TKT) air-jet sewing thread, have been maintained constant in the study so as to eliminate the effects of other parameters on texturing.|$|E
30|$|Since air-jet {{textured}} yarn {{has already been}} established within the industry, {{it is vital to}} improve the yarn quality while reducing the production cost. Since the production costs have already been reduced significantly by minimising compressed air consumption and using POY etc., attention is now needed at saving costs elsewhere. One option would be to find a cheaper substitute fluid for air as a texturing medium. There is no literature regarding this so far. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop the use of high-pressure steam, as a substitute fluid for compressed air to produce spun-like {{textured yarn}}. The new product holds the potential for competitive advantage, lower manufacturing costs and streamlined manufacturing capabilities. The idea is to take the technology of <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> and to modify the process so that high-pressure steam can be used as the texturing medium. Furthermore, study of the effect of effect-yarn draw ratio and overfeed percentage is critical for the textile application perspectives since surface characteristic of the core-effect spun like textured yarn is mainly determined by the effect-yarn overfeed.|$|E
40|$|The <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> {{process is}} briefly {{introduced}} and its advantages over other texturing processes are summarized. Characteristics of air-jet textured yarns are stated with special {{reference to the}} stability of the yarns. Test methods used in industry and research to determine the "stability" or "instability" of air-jet textured yarns are critically reviewed. These methods involve different basic principles and therefore inevitably give different results. There is no consensus on a standard method. Effects of various test parameters, such as specimen length, test duration, and the alternatives of using a single yarn, a hank, or a skein as a test specimen are investigated. An improved test method is suggested as a standard instability test, and various existing methods are compared with it. Results of all the methods show similar trends for varying values of air pressure. Other yarn characteristics such as linear density, breaking elongation, and tenacity are also determined, and their indications of yarn quality are compared with the indications of instability tests. Stability test results alone provide misleading information regarding air-jet textured yarn quality...|$|E
40|$|POY yarns {{are well}} know and commercialized since 1970 s. On the other hand, air-jet {{textured}} yarns are very common {{due to their}} unique structure which looks like natural spun-staple yarns. In the <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> process, the yarn is textured by overfeeding into a high-pressure of air to create a looped and more natural yarn appearance and also the bulkiness level of the yarn is controlled by input speed and jet-take out speed. This process reassigns flat, continous synthetic yarns into entangled, convoluted, bulky, spun like structured yarns. They are of higher bulk, exhibits increased covering power, have a more subdued lustre and are warmer in hand. Therefore, air-jet textured yarns possess some unique properties that require investigation. Hence, in this study, first the texturing process is introduced briefly and its principle of manufacturing is illustrated, later four different types of yarns were produced with two different fibre cross-sections at the three different nozzle types and three different core yarn feeding. The produced yarn production details are given and their breaking strength, elongation and work of rupture are studied along with their morphological structures by using light microscope and SEM. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effect of POY fibre cross-section on air-jet textured yarn mechanical properties. The overall results showed that coarser air-jet textured yarns with a round shape have higher breaking strength, elongation and work of rupture than the trilobal shaped yarns.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The <b>air-jet</b> <b>texturing</b> (AJT) and intermingling (INT) processes are two applications of air jets used to modify the structure of synthetic multifilament yarns. The modification is performed by high-speed jets, which are created by purpose designed nozzles. The present work experimentally investigates the interrelation between properties of the yarn produced and air flow and the nozzle geometry {{in order to gain}} an improved understanding of the AJT process. Firstly, a number of industrial AJT nozzles were selected for detailed analysis. undisturbed flows created by these nozzles are investigated by means of total pressure measurements and shadowgraphy. The effect of nozzle geometry on the AJT process is investigated by using a series of systematically designed nozzles. A number of geometrical parameters of cylindrical type AJT nozzles are specified for successful texturing, after assessing performance of the nozzles by stabilising zone tension and the properties of yarns produced. It is found that large exit length and slightly diverging main duct are beneficial for texturing. Also the trumpet shaped exit profile is found to be necessary for adequate texturing. Low tilt angle of air inlet hole is recommended. Effect of wetting on AJT is investigated with special reference to yarn-to-yarn and yarn-to-metal friction. It is found that when the supply yarn is treated with water interfilament friction prior to the nozzle is reduced, but increased slightly in the texturing area. The former may make relative movement of filaments easier. The latter is considered {{to be one of the}} ways through which wetting improves the process, since it assists anchoring the loops in the yarn. Subsequently high-speed cine-photograpy is deployed to visualise the AJT process inside and around exit area of the nozzle. The nozzle used has rectangular cross-section and one glass wall, which allows to see inside the main channel. It is found that for successful texturing loop formation and fixing the loops are both necessary. The INT process is investigated by using again several systematically designed nozzles with reference to correlation between nip frequency and nozzle geometry. Rectangular nozzles are found to be performing adequately, depending on their dimensions. The nozzles with area ratio smaller than unity perform adequate intermingling. It is also found that small aspect ratio is benefical in terms of nip frequency. A better understanding of the INT is achieved by means of SEM, high speed video and cine-photography and yarn tension measurements. The yarn is found to be necessary to run constantly against the incoming flow to reduce missing nips...|$|E
