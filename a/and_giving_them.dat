5|$|A.P. Hill has {{received}} some criticism for his ineffective performance. His actions caused {{the battle to}} begin and then escalate on July 1, despite Lee's orders not to bring on a general engagement (although historians point out that Hill kept Lee well informed of his actions during the day). However, Hill's illness minimized his personal involvement {{in the remainder of}} the battle, and Lee took the explicit step of temporarily removing troops from Hill's corps <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> to Longstreet for Pickett's Charge.|$|E
5|$|Athletes from 24countries won {{at least}} one medal, leaving 53countries without a medal. Germany led in overall medals (36) for the second {{consecutive}} Winter Games. Immediately following the Games, Germany was also the gold medal leader with twelve. Two years later, Norway was awarded two extra gold medals, raising their total to thirteen <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> the lead. In addition, Norway tied the former Soviet Union in 1976 for most gold medals at a Winter Olympics. This record would later be broken by Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Croatia and Estonia won the first medals and first Gold medals in their Winter Olympic history, while Australia and China won their first gold medals. With 36 total medals, Germany set a record for most total medals at a Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{began writing}} the song's lyrics on November 24, 1965, when he {{scribbled}} down some rough ideas for later development, following {{a discussion with}} guitarist Brian Jones, before the Byrds made a concert appearance supporting the Rolling Stones. Over the following days, Clark expanded this fragment into a full poem, eventually setting the words to music <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> a melody. Clark then showed the song to McGuinn and Crosby, with the former suggesting that the song be arranged to incorporate Coltrane's influence. Since Clark's death, however, McGuinn has contended that {{it was he who}} conceived the initial idea of writing a song about an airplane ride and that he and Crosby both contributed lyrics to Clark's unfinished draft. In his book, Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark, author John Einarson disputes this claim and ponders whether McGuinn's story would be the same were Clark still alive.|$|E

5|$|Durkheim saw {{religion}} {{as the most}} fundamental social institution of humankind, and one {{that gave rise to}} other social forms. It was the religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of collective consciousness. Durkheim saw the {{religion as}} a force that emerged in the early hunter and gatherer societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> a sense of some hidden force driving them. Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane. However, Durkheim also believed that religion was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by science and the cult of an individual.|$|E
5|$|Completed scripts {{were sent}} to Studio B for {{pre-production}} and animation using Macromedia Flash Professional 8. Thiessen's production team was also allowed to select key personnel subject to Hasbro's approval; one of those selected was art director Ridd Sorensen. The Studio B team would storyboard the provided scripts, incorporating any direction and sometimes managing to create scenes that the writers had believed impossible to show in animation. The animators would then prepare the key character poses, layout, background art, and other main elements, and send these versions back to the production team in Los Angeles for review by Hasbro and suggestions from the writers. Thiessen credited much of the technical expertise in the show to Wooton, who created Flash programs to optimize the placement and posing of the pony characters and other elements, simplifying and economizing {{on the amount of}} work needed from the other animators. For example, the ponies' manes and tails are generally fixed shapes, animated by bending and stretching them in curves in three dimensions <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> a sense of movement without the high cost of individual animated hairs. The storyboard artists and animators also need to fill in background characters for otherwise scripted scenes as to populate the world. According to writer Meghan McCarthy, many of the small nods to the fandom, pop culture references, or other easter eggs would be added at this point by the studio. Once the pre-production work was approved and completed, the episode would then be animated. Though Studio B performed the initial animation work, the final steps were passed to Top Draw Animation in the Philippines, an animation studio that Studio B had worked with in the later part of season one and beyond.|$|E

Although the transition of power from Estrada to Arroyo interrupted congressional discussions on the issue, the talks eventually resumed, tracking the rescue plan outlined by the BSP and the Bankers Association of the Philippines. Finally, in 2003, congress passed the Special Purpose Vehicles Act, allowing banks to sell their bank loans at a discount <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> regulatory incentives that {{made it easier to}} book the losses.|$|E
25|$|Anthony's {{father was}} an {{abolitionist}} and a temperance advocate. A Quaker, he had a difficult relationship with his traditionalist congregation, which rebuked him for marrying a non-Quaker and then disowned him for allowing a dance school to operate in his home. He continued to attend Quaker meetings anyway and became even more radical in his beliefs. Anthony's mother was not a Quaker but helped raise their children in a more tolerant version of her husband's religious tradition.
