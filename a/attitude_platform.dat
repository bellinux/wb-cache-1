40|$|The testbed for on-orbit {{servicing}} and {{formation flying}} dynamics emulation is a facility {{to emulate the}} force and momentum-free dynamics of multi-spacecraft missions on ground. The facility consists of a large granite table and several air cushion vehicles that float on this table. The granite table has a size of 4 m x 2. 5 m and a thickness of 0. 6 m with a very high evenness. The air-cushion vehicles consist of two parts: a lower translation platform and an upper <b>attitude</b> <b>platform.</b> Both platforms are connected by a spherical air bearing. The translation platform carries the flat air bearings which enable the vehicle to float on the table, high pressure air tanks to support the flat and the spherical air bearings and a vertical linear actuator. With this actuator {{it is possible to}} adjust the altitude of the spherical air bearing and thereby the altitude of the <b>attitude</b> <b>platform.</b> All components needed for a control loop to actuate the air cushion vehicles are mounted on the <b>attitude</b> <b>platform.</b> These are 12 proportional cold gas thrusters with high pressure air tanks, 3 reaction wheels, an onboard computer with real-time operating system and Wireless LAN for communications and software upload, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a sensor for an infrared tracking system. In addition the <b>attitude</b> <b>platform</b> carries a power system with batteries to support all components with electrical energy and a balancing system to move the center of mass {{in the center of the}} spherical air bearing. Due to the linear air bearing the system can emulate 2 translational degrees of freedom. The third translational degree of freedom (parallel to gravity vector) can be actuated by the vertical linear actuator. As the <b>attitude</b> <b>platform</b> can tilt and rotate, 3 rotational degrees of freedom are emulated. So there is a total of 5 + 1 degrees of freedom that can be emulated by the testbed. One purpose of this testbed is the testing of control algorithms for multi-spacecraft missions. It can be used for precise formation control as well as path-planning and formation acquisition. In addition to the usage of real hardware as in Hardware-in-the-Loop simulations, the force and momentum-free dynamics are not simulated but are real (emulation). This is also a foundation for the second task of the testbed: the emulation of contact dynamics for Rendezvous and Docking missions. Models of docking adapters can be mounted on the <b>attitude</b> <b>platform</b> of the air-cushion vehicles and docking maneuvers with real contact dynamics can be tested on ground. A further purpose of the testbed is the qualification of dedicated relative navigation sensors and inter-spacecraft communication systems. These components can also be mounted on the <b>attitude</b> <b>platform</b> and tested in an agile environment. This paper describes the design and configuration of the testbed for on-orbit servicing and formation flying dynamics emulation. Results showing the quality of the force and momentum-free environment are presented. First control, navigation and thruster actuation algorithms have been developed and their design and the result of their usage within the testbed are also shown. Finally possible scenarios for the usage of this testbed are presented and an outlook on further developments and improvements is given...|$|E
40|$|High {{fidelity}} {{engineering simulation}} {{plays a key}} role in the rapidly developing field of space-based formation flying. This paper describes the design and implementation of the Formation Algorithms and Simulation Testbed (FAST). 1 This testbed was designed to provide real-time, high-fidelity engineering simulation of multiple spacecraft operating in formation. By distributing the simulation across multiple CPUs, the FAST provides an analyst or software developer with a scalable architecture for examining timing, sensor datafusion, inter-spacecraft communication and system-wide formation robustness. The testbed is designed to maintain a very flight-like feel, with flight software algorithms running on single-board PowerPC 750 VxWorks computers. The flight computers communicate with the distributed simulation computers over a reflective memory interface. As part of recent development and testing activities, the FAST was used to simulate the Formation Control Testbed (FCT). 2 FCT is a ground-based, robotic testbed built at JPL.

40|$|A paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} utilizing some flight data, aboard a spacecraft that includes reaction wheels for attitude control, to estimate the inertia matrix of the spacecraft. The required data are digitized samples of (1) the spacecraft attitude in an inertial reference frame as measured, for example, by use of a star tracker and (2) speeds of rotation of the reaction wheels, the moments of inertia of which are deemed to be known. Starting from the classical equations for conservation of angular momentum of a rigid body, the inertia-matrix-estimation problem is formulated as a constrained least-squares minimization problem with explicit bounds on the inertia matrix incorporated as linear matrix inequalities. The explicit bounds reflect physical bounds on the inertia matrix and reduce the volume of data that must be processed to obtain a solution. The resulting minimization problem is a semidefinite optimization problem that can be solved efficiently, with guaranteed convergence to the global optimum, by use of readily available algorithms. In a test case involving a model <b>attitude</b> <b>platform</b> rotating on an air bearing, it is shown that, relative to a prior method, the present method produces better estimates from few data...|$|E

40|$|In current warfare {{scenario}} stealth {{and passive}} threat detection capabilities are considered as prime requirements to accomplish desired mission by the fighter aircrafts. To improve the stealth of an aircraft, {{the trend is}} towards detecting threats {{with the help of}} passive sensors (Electro Optic or Infrared). Current situation caters for systems like Infra-red Search and Track (IRST) and Passive Missile Warning Systems (PMWS). IRST system is a passive target detection system, used for detecting aerial & ground targets. PMWS is a threat detection system used for detecting missiles approaching towards aircraft. Both of these systems detect targets of interest by processing IR images acquired in mid-IR region. The prime challenge in IRST system or PMWS is detecting a moving target of size typically 1 ~ 2 pixels in acquired image sequences. The temporal change caused by moving target in consecutive frames can be considered as one important factor to detect them. The temporal change caused by moving target is identified through absolute frame differencing of successive frames. This principle has limitation in application to IRST & PMWS as the imaging sensor with the aircraft is moving. This motion also imparts temporal change in the acquired images. In this paper authors are proposing a method for removing the temporal change caused by the platform motion in two consequently acquired frames using registration process.   The proposed method uses the <b>platform</b> <b>attitude</b> information at frame sampling times.

40|$|Attitude {{determination}} {{through the}} use of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals {{is one of the many}} applications of satellite-based navigation. Multiple GNSS antennas installed on a given platform are used to provide orientation estimates, thus adding attitude information to the standard positioning service. Precise attitude estimates are obtained by exploiting the higher ranging resolution of the carrier phase observables, which are of two orders of magnitude more accurate than pseudorange measurements. However, each carrier phase measurement is ambiguous by an unknown integer number of cycles. Carrier phase integer ambiguity resolution is the key to high-precision GNSS positioning, navigation, and attitude determination. It is the process of resolving the unknown cycle ambiguities of the carrier phase data as integers. After ambiguity resolution, precise baseline estimates become available, which can be used to derive the <b>attitude</b> of a <b>platform</b> equipped with multiple antennas. The purpose of this contribution is to present, analyze and test a novel ambiguity estimation and attitude determination method. The ambiguity-attitude estimation method given and analyzed in this work is an implementation of the constrained integer-least quares, an extension of the well-known least-squares method applied to systems whose parameters are subject to mixed constraints. The key to this new method is an extension of the popular LAMBDA method: the multivariate constrained LAMBDA method. The method estimates the integer ambiguities and the <b>platforms</b> <b>attitude</b> in an integral manner, fully exploiting the known body geometry of the multi-antenna configuration by means of multiple geometrical constraints. As a result, the ambiguity resolution performance is greatly improved, and the reliability of the GNSS-based attitude solution is enhanced.

However, when no {{prior knowledge of}} the initial system state is available, (e. g., {{at the onset of}} the system’s operation), the existing approaches are not applicable. To address this problem, in this work we present algorithms for computing the system’s observable quantities (<b>platform</b> <b>attitude</b> and velocity, feature positions, and IMUcamera calibration) directly from the sensor measurements, without any prior knowledge. A key contribution of this work is a convex-optimization based algorithm for computing the rotation matrix between the camera and IMU. We show that once this rotation matrix has been computed, all remaining quantities can be determined by solving a quadratically constrained least-squares problem. To increase their accuracy, the initial estimates are refined by an iterative maximum-likelihood estimator. I...|$|R
