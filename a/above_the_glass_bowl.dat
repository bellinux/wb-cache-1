5000|$|The {{first game}} in the Rockets' stadium was on September 25, 1937. Grass {{had not yet been}} planted around the stadium and there were no {{walkways}} to the entrance. Thus, when heavy rainfall deluged the area, mud blocked the gates and the game had to be postponed until the following Monday. The Rockets went on to beat Bluffton College, 26-0.The Rockets' stadium is known as the [...] "Glass Bowl" [...] in recognition of Toledo's distinction of being <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> capital of <b>the</b> world. The stadium was not named the [...] "Glass Bowl" [...] until renovations in 1946. The origin of the name dates back to 1946 and a man named Wayne Kohn, an employee of the structural engineering department of <b>the</b> Libbey-Owens Ford <b>Glass</b> Co., who suggested an annual <b>Glass</b> <b>Bowl</b> football game to be played in the Rockets' stadium. Three Toledo glass manufacturing companies developed the idea further and with the University sponsored a [...] "Glass Bowl" [...] stadium, which was a renovation of the then current stadium. The stone structures at the northeast and northwest corners of <b>the</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>Bowl</b> are called Blockhouses. In the past, the Blockhouses were used as a residence for the football players. The Rockets would stay in the west Blockhouse and the visitors would stay in the east Blockhouse. <b>The</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>Bowl</b> is <b>the</b> second oldest stadium in the Mid-American Conference, behind Ohio University's Peden Stadium. Over the years there have been many renovations made to <b>the</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>Bowl,</b> such as switching from grass to Astroturf in October 1974; building an electronic scoreboard in 1975; adding seats in 1972; again adding seats, a press tower, luxury boxes, and Larimer Athletic Complex in 1990, and switching to NeXturf, an artificial surface carefully modeled after natural grass, in July 2001. The outer wall and Blockhouses are all that remain of <b>the</b> original <b>Glass</b> <b>Bowl</b> Stadium.|$|R
