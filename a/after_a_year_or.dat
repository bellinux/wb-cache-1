5|$|The {{flagship}} {{journal of}} the LSA, Language, is ranked {{as one of the}} top journals in the field. The journal is almost as old as the Society itself. First published in March 1925 and edited by George Melville Bolling, Aurelio Espinosa, and Edward Sapir, the journal published its 92nd volume in 2016 under the editorship of Gregory Carlson. Dr. Carlson's successor, Andries Coetzee, was elected Editor of Language in 2016 and assumed office in 2017 for a term of seven years. The journal is partially open access, allowing articles to be published open access <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>or</b> immediately for a fee.|$|E

That is, they offer far higher discounts more frequently for off-peak times, while raising prices only marginally for peak times, resulting in higher revenue overall.|$|E
25|$|Before menopause, a woman's periods {{typically}} become irregular, {{which means}} that periods may be longer or shorter in duration or be lighter or heavier {{in the amount of}} flow. During this time, women often experience hot flashes; these typically last from 30 seconds to ten minutes and may be associated with shivering, sweating, and reddening of the skin. Hot flashes often stop occurring <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> two. Other symptoms may include vaginal dryness, trouble sleeping, and mood changes.|$|E
25|$|Electrode {{stimulation}} from surgically implanted electrodes {{has been}} studied {{in the past decade}} in hopes of a permanent pain treatment without refraction. Electric stimulation utilizing implants deliver specific voltages to a specific part of the brain for specific durations. More recently, research is being done in radiation therapy as long term treatment of Dejerine–Roussy syndrome. In general, these studies have concluded initial efficacy in such implants, but pain often re-appears <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> so. Long-term efficacy of stimulation treatments must be further tested and evaluated.|$|E

25|$|In 1846 Kentucky paid close {{attention}} to the Mexican–American War. Some citizens enthusiastically supported the war, at least in part because residents believed victory would bring new lands for the expansion of slavery. Others—especially Whigs, who followed Henry Clay, opposed the war and refused to participate. The quest for honor was especially important, as a rising generation sought their self-identity and a link with heroic ancestors. The state easily met its quota of 2500 volunteer troops in 1846 and 1847. Although the war's popularity declined <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> two, clear majorities supported it throughout.|$|E
25|$|One such plan put the {{refugees}} {{to work in}} lands in the Hudson Valley, acquired from the Dutch a few decades earlier, producing naval stores. However the mostly tropical plants that produced tar, rosin and pitch did not endure well in the region's harsh winters, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> two the plan was abandoned. The settlers remained, and took note of the fertile farmlands available in New York. Some moved to {{other regions of the}} colony, but others remained in the area they had been brought to along the east bank of the Hudson in what is now the northwest corner of Dutchess County and southwestern Columbia County between Staatsburg and Germantown. They established farms amongst the local European colonial population, descended from Dutch and British settlers.|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of Kosovo, Prince Lazar was interred in the Church of the Ascension in Priština, {{the capital}} of Vuk Branković's domain. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> two, in 1390 or 1391, Lazar's relics were {{transferred}} to the Ravanica Monastery, which the prince had built and intended as his burial place. The translation was organized by the Serbian Church and Lazar's family. The ceremonial interment of the relics in Ravanica was attended by the highest clergy of the Serbian Church, including Patriarch Danilo III. It is most likely at this time and place that Lazar was canonized, though no account of his canonization was written. He was included among the Christian martyrs, with his feast day being celebrated on 15June. According to writings by Patriarch Danilo and other contemporary authors, Prince Lazar was captured and beheaded by the Turks. His death could thus be likened to that of early Christian martyrs who were slain by pagans.|$|E

Shortly after the album was released, the band found themselves on their first tour of Europe. Although Mucky Pup never had a hit in the U.S., their European distribution deal, combined with this tour, helped the band attain success in Europe. When the band returned home, Nastasi resigned and helped co-found the band Non-Fiction with former members of Hades. Nastasi stayed with Non-Fiction for a short time before leaving to embark on a brief stint with Murphy's Law.

500|$|Varian {{departed}} {{slightly from}} tradition. She started young horses under saddle {{at the age}} of three, beginning with a bridle and a snaffle bit because it sends clearer signals to a young horse, particularly one of sensitive disposition. [...] She then introduced the traditional hackamore, and, after a couple of months to transition between the hackamore and the snaffle, began teaching neck reining, which allows a horse to be ridden one-handed. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> two, when the horse became light in the hackamore, she introduced the young horse to the two-rein, using a light bosal with either a [...] "half-breed" [...] or a low-port curb bit. Once the horse understood the bit, the bosal was removed and the horse was ridden in just the curb bit for a while until ready to go into the full spade bit, at which point the horse went back into the two-rein when the spade is first introduced. She introduced horses to the spade bit {{at the age of}} seven or eight, if they had suitable conformation and temperament to carry it. When she selected and fully trained a spade bit horse for her own personal use, that particular horse stayed with her for life and was never sold.|$|E

2500|$|Hershey Chocolate {{supplied}} the U.S. armed forces with chocolate bars during World War II. These bars were called Ration D Bars and Tropical Chocolate Bars. The Ration D Bar had very specific requirements from the army: It had to weigh {{it had to}} resist melting at temperatures higher than 90 degrees, {{and it had to}} have an unpleasant-enough flavor to prevent the troops from developing cravings for them. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> two, the Army was impressed enough with the durability and success of the Ration D Bar to commission Milton to make the Tropical Chocolate Bar. The only difference between them was that the Tropical Chocolate Bar was made to taste better than the Ration D Bar and still be as durable. Tropical Chocolate Bars were designed not to melt in the tropical weather. It is estimated that between 1940 and 1945, over three billion of the Ration D and Tropical Chocolate Bars were produced and distributed to soldiers throughout the world. In 1939, the Hershey plant was capable of producing 100,000 ration bars a day. By the end of World War II, the entire Hershey plant was producing ration bars at a rate of 24 million a week. For its service throughout World War II, the Hershey Chocolate Company was issued five Army-Navy 'E' Production Awards for exceeding expectations for quality and quantity in the production of the Ration D and Tropical Chocolate Bars. The Hershey factory machine shop even made some parts for tanks and machines during the war.|$|E

The beam engine was replaced in 1890 by a rotary steam engine made by Clarke's of Ashford. This was unsatisfactory and was replaced with a Fowler horizontal steam engine <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> two. This engine was replaced by a suction gas engine in 1919.
