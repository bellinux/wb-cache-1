5|$|On November 11, 1793, Charles IV {{dissolved}} the society. Soon {{the newspaper}} disappeared as well. Espejo {{had no choice}} but to work as a librarian in the National Library.

5|$|Nordmann {{was born}} on 22 November 1915 in Giessen, {{at the time in}} the Grand Duchy of Hesse of the German Empire.

He was then posted to the Jagdfliegerschule (Fighter Pilot School) at Werneuchen, under the command of Oberst (Colonel) Theodor Osterkamp. Since July 1938, he served as a Staffeloffizier (squadron officer) with the Stab of I.

5|$|The Theses {{are written}} as propositions to be argued {{in a formal}} {{academic}} disputation, {{though there is no}} evidence that such an event ever took place. In the heading of the Theses, Luther invited interested scholars from other cities to participate. Holding such a debate was a privilege Luther held as <b>a</b> <b>doctor,</b> <b>and</b> it was not an unusual form of academic inquiry. Luther prepared twenty sets of theses for disputation at Wittenberg between 1516 and 1521. Andreas Karlstadt had written a set of such theses in April 1517, and these were more radical in theological terms than Luther's. He posted them on the door of All Saints' Church, as Luther was alleged to have done with the Ninety-five Theses. Karlstadt posted his theses at a time when the relics of the church were placed on display, and this may have been considered a provocative gesture. Similarly, Luther posted the Ninety-five Theses on the eve of All Saints' Day, the most important day of the year for the display of relics at All Saints' Church.|$|E
