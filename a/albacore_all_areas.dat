As usual, Argus {{provided}} the air cover with a dozen Fulmars from 807 Squadron and Eagle ferried the Albacores and 17 Spitfires to their take-off point for Malta on 19 May. The Spitfires were flown off successfully, but the engines of the <b>Albacores</b> <b>all</b> began to overheat and {{they were forced to}} return to the carrier. Examination of the aircraft revealed that their air coolers had been set to [...] "Winter" [...] rather than [...] "Summer". One of the Fulmars was shot down by Vichy French Dewoitine D.520 fighters as it attempted to protect the crew of a Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat that had been shot down earlier. By this time the ship's Vickers [...]50-calibre machine guns had been replaced by 13 Oerlikon 20mm light anti-aircraft guns.|$|R
