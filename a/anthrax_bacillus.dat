50|$|Because of its {{proximity}} to human populations only two lethal agents, both toxins, were ever tested on the island, botulin and ricin. The U.S. Navy used the site during the war to study mosquitoes and flies that were native to the Pacific Islands.

Shipped samples, it was said, were supposed to be inert. Labs receiving the live samples were in Texas, Maryland, Wisconsin, Delaware, New Jersey, Tennessee, New York, California and Virginia, the Associated Press reported. Days after the first report, the military divulged that the mis-shipments had been broader than initially reported and launched an investigation. Dugway was involved in developing a test to identify biological threats in the field.|$|E

Between 1837 and 1841 he published a three-volume book on diseases of the kidney titled Traité des maladies des reins. In 1850 Rayer published a paper that provided the first description of the <b>anthrax</b> <b>bacillus</b> (Inoculation du sang de rate, 1850). In this work he documented studies that he performed with physician Casimir Davaine (1812-1882) in regards to Bacillus anthracis.

5000|$|Nevius was {{considered}} conscientious, {{so much so}} that at one point the Army wanted to replace him; this resulted in Baldwin resigning his position and becoming an [...] "advisor" [...] to the U.S. BW program. The testing regimen that followed extended well into 1945. The first tests ran water through the system, to ensure there were no leaks. A second round of tests were run with an <b>anthrax</b> simulant, <b>Bacillus</b> globigii. The plant was pronounced water-tight by Nevius in April 1945 and trial runs with the simulant began in June.|$|R
40|$|The results {{obtained}} in the preceding experiments may be briefly summarized as follows: 1. Nucleohiston does not protect against a separate and subcutaneous injection of tetanus toxin, diphtheria toxin, hog-cholera bacillus, or <b>anthrax</b> <b>bacillus.</b> 2. Mixtures of nucleohiston and either tetanus toxin or diphtheria toxin lose their specific toxic action—the latter much more rapidly than the former. Animals that recover after inoculation of such mixtures are not rendered immune. 3. In a mixture of nucleohiston and <b>anthrax</b> <b>bacillus</b> the latter is unaffected, even after the lapse of eleven days. 4. The destruction of specific toxins in a solution of nucleohiston, though {{in part due to}} sodium carbonate, is probably chiefly due to the nucleohiston. 5. Histon does not protect against a separate and subcutaneous injection of tetanus toxin, diphtheria toxin, hog-cholera bacillus, or <b>anthrax</b> <b>bacillus.</b> 6. In a mixture of histon and diphtheria toxin the latter is destroyed in a few minutes. This action is in part, if not wholly, due to the acidity of the histon solution. Similar mixtures of closely related bodies, serum globulin or albumoses, in Witte's pepton, give analogous results. The animals that recover from such inoculations are not rendered immune. Histon does not destroy the tetanus toxin as readily as the diphtheria toxin. 7. Histon possesses decided and marked toxic properties which are not due to the hydrochloric acid present...|$|E

50|$|Siderophores {{are also}} {{important}} for some pathogenic bacteria for their acquisition of iron. In mammalian hosts, iron is tightly bound to proteins such as hemoglobin, transferrin, lactoferrin and ferritin. The strict homeostasis of iron leads to a free concentration of about 10−24 mol L−1, hence there are great evolutionary pressures put on pathogenic bacteria to obtain this metal. For example, the <b>anthrax</b> pathogen <b>Bacillus</b> anthracis releases two siderophores, bacillibactin and petrobactin, to scavenge ferric iron from iron proteins. While bacillibactin {{has been shown to}} bind to the immune system protein siderocalin, petrobactin is assumed to evade the immune system and {{has been shown to be}} important for virulence in mice.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of phagosome escape by intracellular pathogens {{is an important}} step in the infectious cycle. During the establishment of <b>anthrax,</b> <b>Bacillus</b> anthracis undergoes a transient intracellular phase in which spores are engulfed by local phagocytes. Spores germinate inside phagosomes and grow to vegetative bacilli, which emerge from their resident intracellular compartments, replicate and eventually exit from the plasma membrane. During germination, B. anthracis secretes multiple factors that can help its resistance to the phagocytes. Here the possible role of B. anthracis toxins, phospholipases, antioxidant enzymes and capsules in the phagosomal escape and survival, is analyzed and compared with that of factors of other microbial pathogens involved in the same type of process...|$|E

40|$|Acquisition and {{retention}} of spores of an <b>anthrax</b> surrogate, <b>Bacillus</b> atrophaeus Nakamura (2 ̆ 2 BG 2 ̆ 2) were evaluated in eight insect species.

An <b>Anthrax</b> model, <b>Bacillus</b> cereus, was grown for 3 hours and diluted 1 : 25 in media (2. 0 x 107 cfu/ml).

40|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the effects of}} zoonotic diseases on human and animal populations, {{it is critical to}} understand what factors alter transmission dynamics. Here we assess the risk of exposure to lethal concentrations of the <b>anthrax</b> bacterium, <b>Bacillus</b> anthracis, for grazing animals in a natural system over time through different transmission mechanisms. We follow pathogen concentrations at anthrax carcass sites and waterholes for five years and estimate infection risk as a function of grass, soil or water intake, age of carcass sites, and the exposure required for a lethal infection. Grazing, not drinking, seems the dominant transmission route, and transmission is more probable from grazing at carcass sites 1 - 2 years of age. Unlike most studies of virulent pathogens that are conducted under controlled conditions for extrapolation to real situations, we evaluate exposure risk under field conditions to estimate the probability of a lethal dose, showing that not all reservoirs with detectable pathogens are significant transmission pathways...|$|R
