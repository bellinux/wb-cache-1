5|$|In February, Clarke {{suffered}} from <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> jaundice {{that put him}} out of action for about six weeks. He was visited regularly by Maunsell who was, by that time, a firm friend.|$|E
5|$|The {{health-related}} {{quality of}} life (HRQL) after <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> Guillain–Barré syndrome can be significantly impaired. About a fifth are unable to walk unaided after six months, and many experience chronic pain, fatigue and difficulty with work, education, hobbies and social activities. HRQL improves significantly in the first year.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the Australians' {{visit to}} England in 1930 {{there was some}} {{confidence}} in English cricketing circles, since Chapman's victorious 1928–29 side was largely intact and on paper looked formidably strong, especially in batting. England duly won the first Test, at Trent Bridge, by 93 runs, despite a second-innings century from Bradman that for a time threatened to turn the match. Larwood's active participation was curtailed by <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> gastritis; he took 2 wickets in the match for 21 runs.|$|E

30|$|Shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} {{are used in}} various industrial processes, and {{are one of the}} most commonly used {{heat exchangers}}. A shell and tube heat exchanger with a 25 % baffle cut was used in this study. Tubes of different cross-sections (circular, elliptical with <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> angle <b>of</b> 90 ° and elliptical with <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> angle <b>of</b> 0 °) were studied. A combined model of a shell and tube heat exchanger with elliptical tubes with <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> angle <b>of</b> 90 ° and circular tubes was introduced. A heat exchanger with ellipsoidal tubes near the shell with <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> angle <b>of</b> 90 ° and circular tubes in the center of the shell showed the highest heat transfer compared with the shell and tube heat exchangers with circular tubes and elliptical tubes with <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> angle <b>of</b> 90 ° and 0 °. The pressure drop in the tube and shell side was also investigated for all five cases in this study. The effect of the location of tubes on heat transfer was investigated. It was shown that tubes located near the shell have a greater impact on heat transfer compared with tubes located in the center of the shell.|$|R
5|$|As a child Juha Vainio was {{diagnosed}} with congenital heart disease, causing his lips to turn blue, and the onset of rapid breathlessness. He underwent a heart operation in early 1949 {{at the same time}} as his mother suffered <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> tuberculosis from which she later recovered. Juha was at first kept in the adults' ward due to the serious nature of the operation, but later transferred to the children's ward to recover. He soon went home and began to get better.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the victory}} at Buna, for which Herring and Eichelberger were {{appointed}} Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Blamey {{ordered him to}} return to Australia for a rest. While in Melbourne, Herring had <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> malaria, but recovered to resume command in New Guinea in May. Blamey charged him with responsibility for the next phase of Operation Cartwheel, the capture of Lae. Herring would command I Corps, which would be part of New Guinea Force, under Blamey and later Mackay. Blamey intended to have Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead command the subsequent phase of the operation, the assault on Madang.|$|E
5|$|For his {{services}} in Iran, Savige was also mentioned in despatches a third time. He later {{wrote a book}} about his experiences, entitled Stalky's Forlorn Hope, which was published in Melbourne in 1920. In November 1918, he was evacuated to a hospital in Bombay, suffering <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> malaria, and returned to Australia in January 1919 on the City of Exeter.|$|E

5|$|Gout {{is due to}} {{elevated}} levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs due {{to a combination of}} diet and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons and surrounding tissues, resulting in <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who eat a lot of meat, drink a lot of beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or tophus. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack.|$|E
5|$|Having {{suffered}} from long-standing recurrent kidney disease {{that made it}} necessary, from the 1880s, for him to conduct sitting down, Sullivan died of heart failure, following <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> bronchitis, at his flat in London on 22 November 1900. His unfinished opera, The Emerald Isle, was completed by Edward German and produced in 1901. His Te Deum Laudamus, written to commemorate {{the end of the}} Boer War, was performed posthumously.|$|E
5|$|He left West Africa in January 1899, after a {{successful}} posting, but in ill-health; {{a third of}} the officers sent with him had died while on secondment, and Blackader had contracted malaria as well as suffering <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> dysentery. He spent six months on leave to recover, and then sailed to take command of a company of the 1st Leicesters, still stationed in South Africa.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{clinical presentation}} of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, <b>a</b> single <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single symptom. During a CIS, there is <b>a</b> subacute <b>attack</b> suggestive <b>of</b> demyelination {{which should be}} included in the spectrum of MS phenotypes. Treatment with interferons after <b>an</b> initial <b>attack</b> decreases the risk of developing clinical definite MS.|$|R
5|$|In 1864, Ewing {{suffered}} <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> rheumatism, {{and received}} treatment several times thereafter, often being confined to his chair. He was likely prostrated with illness as Commander of Louisville during Burbridge's madness in Kentucky. He {{was made a}} brevet major general on March 13, 1865. After leaving the Army, he experienced painful attacks {{for the rest of}} his life, often bedridden for periods of up to forty days.|$|E
5|$|Krueger came to {{feel that}} the {{prospects}} for promotion in the infantry were very poor, and in 1927 he tried to transfer to the United States Army Air Corps. He attended the Air Corps Primary Flying School at Brooks Field, Texas, but suffered <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> neuritis in his right arm, and his flight instructor, Lieutenant Claire Lee Chennault, failed him. In December 1927, he was offered a position as an instructor at the Naval War College, where he taught classes on World War I, and on joint operations.|$|E
5|$|Morris died in 1896, and {{the health}} of the devastated Burne-Jones {{declined}} substantially. In 1898 he suffered <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> influenza, and had apparently recovered when he was again taken suddenly ill, and died on 17June 1898. Six days later, at the intervention of the Prince of Wales, a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey. It was the first time an artist had been so honoured. Burne-Jones was buried in the churchyard at St Margaret's Church, Rottingdean, a place he knew through summer family holidays.|$|E

5000|$|This {{defines the}} maximum distance, {{measured}} in hexes {{on the playing}} map, between an active piece and the target <b>of</b> its <b>attack.</b> For example, if a piece has <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> range <b>of</b> two, the target <b>of</b> its <b>attack</b> must be located within two hexes of the piece. Most combat units have <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> range <b>of</b> 1 by default. 'Combat' spirits with <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> range >1 are {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "archers" [...] in SpiritWars.|$|R

5|$|Pendragon's only form of defence in {{the game}} {{is his ability to}} utilise various magical spells, in which the correct spell is {{required}} in order to defeat certain enemies. If the player is hit by <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> any enemy in the castle, Pendragon will lose energy, or in some cases, time will be deducted from the countdown timer. If the player completely runs out of energy or fails to destroy the Staff of Karnath before midnight, the game will end.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of sixteen Huxley had <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> keratitis, which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him with one eye just capable of light {{perception}} {{and the other with}} an unaided Snellen fraction of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas, complicated by hyperopia and astigmatism. He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with atropine, to allow that eye to see around an opacity {{in the center of the}} cornea.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{candidates}} declared their {{candidacy for}} the Democratic nomination, including Rhea and Lieutenant Governor Chandler. Former governor Beckham {{was not a}} candidate; his only son had died in late 1934, devastating his family and leaving his wife strongly opposed to another political campaign. Near {{the end of the}} primary campaign, Laffoon suffered <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> appendicitis and required an appendectomy, leaving him unable to campaign for Rhea. Two candidates dropped out of the race prior to the election.|$|E

5|$|The road makes several {{appearances}} in literature. In Charles Dickens' David Copperfield, the titular character {{runs down the}} road trying to escape from London to Dover, though in the narrative the street is still partly rural in nature. After suffering <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> amnesia, the main character of George Orwell's A Clergyman's Daughter, Dorothy Hare, finds herself alone on Old Kent Road. In 1985, the BBC arts series Arena included a documentary about the road.|$|E
5|$|The third edition was {{prepared}} under great disadvantage. Scrivener after adding 125 pages to his book had <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> paralysis, as result {{his work was}} not wholly conducted upon the same high level as his previous publications. The framework of the second edition was originally adopted; and the new additional material was only added to the almost unchanged material.|$|E
5|$|At Emma Town Bartlett met Baron Kleist, a {{distinguished}} Russian official who {{offered to take}} him to Emma Harbour on the coast, a week's journey away, where he could look for a ship to Alaska. Bartlett accepted, and on 10 May, though still weak from his journey and <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> tonsillitis, said goodbye to Kataktovik (who was remaining for the time being in Emma Town), and set off with the baron. On the way they learned that Captain Pedersen was in the area. On 16 May they reached Emma Harbour; five days later Pedersen arrived in the whaler Herman and, without delay, took Bartlett on board and set out for Alaska. They arrived off Nome on 24 May, but ice prevented them reaching the shore. After three days' waiting they turned south, and landed at St Michael, where Bartlett was at last able to send a radio message to Ottawa informing the government of Karluk's fate. He also made enquiries about the whereabouts of the United States revenue cutter Bear, which he saw as a possible rescue vessel for the stranded party.|$|E
30|$|The highest overall heat {{transfer}} coefficient was obtained for STHE-CT&ET 90 ° and STHE-ET 90 ° arrangements, respectively. The lowest overall {{heat transfer}} coefficient was obtained for STHE-ET 0 ° and STHE-CT arrangements, respectively. This indicates an increase in heat transfer in heat exchangers with elliptical tubes and <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> angle <b>of</b> 90 ° than elliptical tubes with <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> angle <b>of</b> 0 ° and circular tubes.|$|R
