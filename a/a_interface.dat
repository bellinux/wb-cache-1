This approach yields a precise definition of <b>an</b> <b>interface.</b> With this definition as starting point, the inherent structure of <b>an</b> <b>interface</b> is developed. <b>A</b> horizontal and vertical partitioning strategy, based on one functional entity per partition and described by a state description, is used to specify the structure.

30|$|In [31], Yoon and Vaidya {{proposed}} a network layer scheme that utilizes multiple heterogeneous wireless interfaces in multi-hop wireless networks. The {{idea is to}} use two heterogeneous wireless interfaces in each node: a primary 802.11 <b>a</b> <b>interface</b> and a secondary 802.11 b (or 802.11) interface. The primary path over 802.11 <b>a</b> <b>interface</b> is maintained by a reactive routing protocol such as DSR, while the secondary path over 802.11 b interface is maintained by a proactive routing protocol such as Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing (DSDV). In normal conditions, TCP data packets will use the primary path, which has the higher rate, and the control packets (ACK) will take the secondary path. In the event of link failures, TCP will use the secondary path to recover its packets and preserve its window size. It keeps communicating using the low-rate interface, until the high-rate path is recovered. The 802.11 b (or 802.11) interface is used at the secondary path because they exhibit different properties than the 802.11 <b>a</b> <b>interface</b> (i.e., slower rate but larger transmission range).|$|E
