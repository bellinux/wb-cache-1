50|$|In 1962, the CNES (France’s National Centre for Space Studies) {{decided to}} build a low density and {{high-speed}} wind tunnel essential for aerodynamic and aerothermal studies in rarefied gas flows. This wind tunnel called SR3 was located in the <b>Aerothermodynamics</b> Laboratory from the CNRS (France's national scientific research center) in Meudon. The construction of the facility was delegated to the SESSIA (engineering consultants for aeronautical industrial works) and was achieved in 1963. The wind tunnel was then moved to the ICARE Laboratory in Orléans in 2000, {{as a result of}} the merging of the <b>Aerothermodynamics</b> Laboratory and the LCSR (Combustion and Reactive Systems Laboratory). Then, it was renamed MARHy which is the acronym for Mach Adaptable Rarefied Hypersonic.|$|E

50|$|Development of {{protection}} structures that are tough and light-weight, {{development of an}} aerodynamic shape that has a high lift to drag ratio, development of automatic navigation control systems etc. {{were some of the}} initial technical challenges that had been overcome in the final design. The various departments involved in designing the vehicle included <b>aerothermodynamics,</b> materials science, hypersonic navigation, guidance and control systems, endo- and exo-atmospheric flight dynamics, telemetry and range safety analysis. The craft could cover 17,000 kilometres, the distance between London and Sydney, in 49 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Hypersonic flows, however, require other {{similarity}} parameters. First, {{the analytic}} equations for the oblique shock angle become nearly independent of Mach number at high (~>10) Mach numbers. Second, {{the formation of}} strong shocks around aerodynamic bodies means that the freestream Reynolds number is less useful as {{an estimate of the}} behavior of the boundary layer over a body (although it is still important). Finally, the increased temperature of hypersonic flows mean that real gas effects become important. For this reason, research in hypersonics {{is often referred to as}} <b>aerothermodynamics,</b> rather than aerodynamics.|$|E
50|$|European eXPErimental Re-entry Test-bed (EXPERT) is a European Space Agency <b>aerothermodynamics</b> {{research}} programme. It {{was planned}} that vehicle will be launched on a Russian Volna launch system and will provide {{knowledge and experience}} {{in the design and}} development of re-entry vehicles. As of 2012, one element in a European Space Agency push to develop vehicles capable of re-entry has been pushed back until at least 2013 as the agency seeks a launch alternative to the Russian submarine-launched Volna rocket which was withdrawn. One of its main goals was to test materials for ESA’s Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV), an unmanned, delta-winged plane launched in 2015 aboard ESA’s new Vega small-satellite launcher. Currently EXPERT remains in storage conditions in Turin.|$|E
50|$|Current {{research}} {{areas of}} the NGPDL include electric propulsion, hypersonic <b>aerothermodynamics,</b> flows involving very small length scales (MEMS devices), and materials processing (jets used in deposition thin films for advanced materials). Due to nonequilibrium effects, these flows cannot always be computed accurately with the macroscopic equations of gas dynamics and plasma physics. Instead, the lab has adopted a microscopic approach in which the atoms/molecules in a gas and the ions/electrons in a plasma are simulated on computationally using {{a large number of}} model particles within sophisticated Monte Carlo methods. The lab has developed a general 2D/axi-symmetric/3D code, MONACO, for simulating nonequilibrium neutral flows that can run either on scalar workstations or in a parallel computing environment.|$|E
50|$|Following the Russian Sputnik launch, in July 1960 {{he moved}} with other von Braun rocket {{scientists}} from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency to the newly founded NASA. There, {{as part of the}} Apollo moon-landing program, he made major contributions working on the Saturn V booster rocket, on <b>aerothermodynamics,</b> and on liquid hydrogen propellant systems. He subsequently was involved in numerous projects contributing to the nation’s manned and unmanned space flight programs, especially Skylab and the Space Shuttle. In the Shuttle development effort he led a team working on vehicle aerodynamics and the main engines, which included developing full-scale component tests and scaling methodologies, and applying computational fluid dynamics to overcome a wide range of aerothermochemistry problems.|$|E

After successfully completing this assignment, he established, staffed, and directed the Mission Analysis Division, a small [...] "think-tank" [...] organization created to study the research requirements of advanced aircraft and spacecraft and of missions of future interest to NASA. In this position, Syvertson first reported to Ames and later to NASA Headquarters. From this position, {{he went on to}} head the Astronautics Directorate at Ames, directing research in space physics, planetary atmospheres, entry <b>aerothermodynamics,</b> and hypersonic aerodynamics. He also had management responsibility for an advanced magnetometer experiment carried {{to the surface of the}} moon on an early Apollo program mission. In 1969, he was named Deputy Director of Ames with primary responsibility for institutional management of the Center. As Deputy Director, Syvertson supervised the development of many of the management and budgeting systems used by Ames today; some of these systems have been adopted by other NASA centers.|$|E

40|$|Aerothermoelasticity {{is one of}} the key {{technologies}} for hypersonic vehicles. Accurate and efficient computation of the <b>aerothermodynamics</b> {{is one of the}} primary challenges for hypersonic aerothermoelastic analysis. Aimed at solving the shortcomings of engineering calculation, computation fluid dynamics (CFD) and experimental investigation, a reduced order modeling (ROM) framework for <b>aerothermodynamics</b> based on CFD predictions using an enhanced algorithm of fast maximin Latin hypercube design is developed. Both proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and surrogate are considered and compared to construct ROMs. Two surrogate approaches named Kriging and optimized radial basis function (ORBF) are utilized to construct ROMs. Furthermore, an enhanced algorithm of fast maximin Latin hypercube design is proposed, which proves to be helpful to improve the precisions of ROMs. Test results for the three-dimensional aerothermodynamic over a hypersonic surface indicate that: the ROMs precision based on Kriging is better than that by ORBF, ROMs based on Kriging are marginally more accurate than ROMs based on POD-Kriging.
