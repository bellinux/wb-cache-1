5|$|With the expiry of the copyrights, {{companies}} {{around the}} world have been free to produce Gilbert and Sullivan works and to adapt them <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>please</b> for almost 50 years. Productions of Pinafore, both amateur and professional, range from the traditional, in the D'Oyly Carte vein, to the broadly adapted, such as that of the very successful Essgee Entertainment (formed by Simon Gallaher) in Australia and Opera della Luna in Britain. Since its original production, H.M.S. Pinafore has remained one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most popular comic operas. Productions continue in large numbers {{around the world}}. In 2003 alone, The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company rented 224 sets of orchestra parts, mostly for productions of Pinafore, Pirates and Mikado. This {{does not take into account}} other rental companies and the theatre companies that borrow scores or have their own, or that use only one or two pianos instead of an orchestra. Hundreds of productions of Pinafore are presented every year worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} Arkham City are set {{one year after}} Batman: Arkham Asylum. Quincy Sharp, the asylum's {{erstwhile}} director, has taken sole credit for halting the Joker's armed siege, using this distinction to become mayor of Gotham City. Declaring both the asylum and Blackgate Penitentiary no longer suitable to contain the city's detainees, Sharp's administration orders both facilities closed and he purchases Gotham's most notorious slums, converting them into an immense prison enclosure known as Arkham City. This facility is subsequently placed {{in the care of}} psychiatrist Hugo Strange—who is secretly manipulating Sharp—and monitored by a rogue private military firm, TYGER Security. Strange permits the inmates to do <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>please,</b> so long as they do not attempt to escape. A wary Batman maintains his own vigil over the new project, concerned that the chaotic situation there will get out of hand. Meanwhile, the Joker is suffering from a potentially fatal disease caused by his previous consumption of the Titan formula, an unstable steroid serum which turns men into maddened monsters.|$|E

However, neither poll is necessarily reflective of opinion in Australia with anyone in the world can vote as often <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>please,</b> and the sample is not random. However, a poll on the Wide World of Sports website revealed 41,000 of the 50,000 respondents did not want Ponting removed.|$|E
25|$|Due to 2012's {{national}} budget cuts, the AHR was removed. The regulation of assisted reproduction was then delegated to each province. This delegation provides provinces {{with a lot}} of leeway to do <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>please.</b> As a result, provinces like Quebec, Alberta and Manitoba have put almost the full costs of IVF on the public healthcare bill. Dr. Santiago Munne, developer of the first PGD test for Down's syndrome and founder of , saw these provincial decisions as an opportunity for his company to grow and open more Reprogenetics labs around Canada. He dismissed all controversies regarding catalogue babies and states that he had no problem with perfect babies.|$|E
25|$|In her works, Abramović affirms her {{identity}} through {{the perspective of}} others, however, more importantly by changing the roles of each player, the identity and nature of humanity at large is unraveled and showcased. By doing so, the individual experience morphs into a collective one and creates a powerful message. Abramović's art also represents the objectification of the female body, as she remains motionless and allows the spectators to do <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>please</b> with her body, pushing the limits of what one would consider acceptable. This type of representation also reflects key political issues such as BDSM, which complicates and questions the relation between art versus sexuality and public discourse.|$|E

25|$|The {{rules of}} the Senate provide that no senator may make more than two speeches on a motion or bill on the same {{legislative}} day. A legislative day begins when the Senate convenes and ends with adjournment; hence, {{it does not necessarily}} coincide with the calendar day. The length of these speeches is not limited by the rules; thus, in most cases, senators may speak for as long <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>please.</b> Often, the Senate adopts unanimous consent agreements imposing time limits. In other cases (for example, for the budget process), limits are imposed by statute. However, the right to unlimited debate is generally preserved.|$|E

25|$|In 1619 his {{daughter}} died shortly after birth, {{the only child}} he was to have. In 1620 after the execution of his father he began to call himself the Baron of Muiresk, which in Scotland was considered an illegitimate claim. His brother James, though disinherited from the estate, still had a claim to the title, which was considered to end with his death, as he had no heir. In any case Thomas was not the second son but the third. The second (Robert) had no heirs, either, which did not strengthen {{the case of the}} Dempsters. They were forced to accept the end of their clan; that is, there were no further charters to Dempsters from the king, nor was anyone entitled to be called Baron Dempster or use the coat of arms. Modern Dempsters, of course, may do <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>please</b> in accordance with the laws of the countries in which they reside.|$|E

500|$|The school {{operates}} under a [...] "noncoercive" [...] philosophy {{where students}} are encouraged to develop their own interests and where all learning is self-directed. As such, Brooklyn Free School has no grades, no tests, and no compulsory classes or homework. Students are free to pursue the activities of their interest, such as reading alone or taking a class. Students are free to leave classes <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>please.</b> Classes have included philosophy seminars, cheese-tasting, book discussions, business, astrology, psychology, videography, and Tibet. Some classes are taught by volunteers. By law, students are required to attend for 5.5 hours a day. Principal Alan Berger contends that the school provides an education better adapted for the Internet era, as one more original, enterprising, and adaptive {{in the face of a}} changing economy.|$|E
500|$|The {{outcome of}} most votes can be {{predicted}} beforehand since political parties normally instruct members {{which way to}} vote. Parties entrust some MSPs, known as whips, {{with the task of}} ensuring that party members vote according to the party line. MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions, since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties. Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright. Thus, as with many Parliaments, the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low, and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party's policies are rare. In some circumstances, however, parties announce [...] "free votes", which allows Members to vote <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>please.</b> This is typically done on moral issues.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the 2006 introduction of the BK XXL product line in Spain, the Spanish Health Ministry publicly claimed {{that the company had}} violated a voluntary agreement between the company and the Spanish Federation of Hoteliers and Restaurateurs, a group to which Burger King belongs, that called on its members to refrain from advertising large portions of food. The Minister of Health, Elena Salgado, claimed that the new promotion and the new sandwiches, averaging over 970 calories each, violated the accord. The head of Spain's food regulatory body, Felix Lobo, stated a legal case could be made against Burger King for [...] "illegally failing to comply with a contract". In a {{response to}} the Government's allegations, the European offices of Burger King released this statement: [...] "In this campaign, we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years. Our philosophy can be summed up with the motto 'As you like it,' in which our customers' taste trumps all." [...] The company also explained that it had always worked [...] "to reduce the risk of illness provoked by an inadequate diet and to promote a balanced... diet." [...] A spokesperson for the company stated that customers have the choice of salads versus a Whopper, that they have the option to modify their sandwiches <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>please,</b> and that the company was going to continue to advertising the products.|$|E
500|$|The {{school is}} {{run as a}} democracy, with {{students}} deciding affairs that range from the curriculum to the behavior code. Lessons are non-compulsory. Neill emphasizes [...] "self-regulation", personal responsibility, freedom from fear, [...] "freedom in sex play", and loving understanding over moral instruction or force. In his philosophy, all attempts to mold children are coercive in nature and therefore harmful. Caretakers are advised to [...] "trust" [...] in the natural process and let children self-regulate such that they live by their own rules and consequently treat with the highest respect {{the rights of others}} to live by their own rules. Neill's [...] "self-regulation" [...] constitutes a child's right to [...] "live freely, without outside authority in things psychic and somatic"—that children eat and come of age when they wants, are never hit, and are [...] "always loved and protected". Children can do <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>please</b> until their actions affect others. In an example, a student can skip French class to play music, but cannot disruptively play music during the French class. Against the popular image of [...] "go as you please schools", Summerhill has many rules. However, they are decided at a schoolwide meeting where students and teachers each have one vote apiece. This does not necessarily mean total cessation to the children, as Neill thought adults were right to bemoan child destruction of property. He considered this tension between adult and child living styles to be natural. Neill felt that most schoolwork and books kept children from their right to play, and that learning should only follow play and not be mixed [...] "to make [...] palatable". Neill found that those students interested in college would complete the prerequisites in two years and of their own volition.|$|E
500|$|The Book of Lucifer {{contains}} a long chapter titled [...] "Satanic Sex", discussing Satanism's view on sexual activity {{as well as}} misconceptions surrounding these views. He denies the belief that sex {{is the most important}} element in LaVeyan Satanism, and that participation in orgies or other promiscuous behavior is forced. He explains that sexual freedom is encouraged, but only in the sense that believers should be free to explore their own sexualities <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>please,</b> without harming others. Along with the rumors regarding Satanic views on sex, LaVey also addresses those about animal and human sacrifice. He explains that the only time a LaVeyan Satanist would perform a human sacrifice would be to accomplish two goals: to [...] "release the magician's wrath" [...] as he or she performed a curse, and to kill someone who deserved to die. He considers the action of hurting another person a request to be destroyed, and explains that the Satanist is morally required to grant this request {{in the form of a}} curse. LaVey also says that a Satanist would never sacrifice a baby or an animal, as they are pure carnal beings and considered to be sacred. In The Book of Lucifer, LaVey outlines LaVeyan Satanism's views on death. He explains that one who has lived a full life will dread death, and that this is the way it should be. He also does not agree with the idea of reincarnation. He encourages a strong will to live, comparing it to animals' instincts to fight viciously for their lives. Suicide is discouraged except in cases of euthanasia, where it would end extreme suffering. Because the Satanist is considered his or her own god, birthdays are celebrated as the most important holidays. Following one's birthday in importance are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween. Solstices and equinoxes are also celebrated.|$|E
