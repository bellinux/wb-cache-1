5|$|Because {{these three}} surface {{energies}} form {{the sides of}} a triangle, they are constrained by the triangle inequalities, γij < γjk + γik meaning that no one of the surface tensions can exceed {{the sum of the}} other two.

5|$|Fairywrens exhibit one of {{the highest}} incidences of extra-pair mating, and many broods <b>are</b> <b>brought</b> up a by male who is not the natural father. However, {{courtship}} methods among white-winged fairywrens remain unclear. Blue-plumaged males have been seen outside of their territory and in some cases, carrying pink or purple petals, which among other species advertise the male to neighboring females. In contrast, black-plumaged males on Barrow and Dirk Hartog islands often carry blue petals. While petal-carrying outside of clan territories strongly suggests mating with other females is occurring, further genetic analysis is necessary.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{motion is}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} anatomical plane it occurs in. Flexion and extension are examples of angular motions, in which two axes of a joint <b>are</b> <b>brought</b> closer together or moved further apart. Rotational motion may occur at other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation and depression, describe movement above or below the horizontal plane. Many anatomical terms derive from Latin terms with the same meaning.|$|E
