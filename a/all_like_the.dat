They bore the image of what was believed {{at the time to}} be Jan van Riebeeck, the first V.O.C. administrator of Cape Town. It was later discovered that the image was not in fact Van Riebeeck at <b>all.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> last pound notes, they were printed in two variants, one with English written first and the other with Afrikaans written first. This practice was continued in the 1966 series which included the first 5-rand notes, but did not include the 20-rand denomination.|$|E

The distribution of powers may be different for every community, as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy, since devolution {{was intended to be}} asymmetrical. Only two communities—the Basque Country and Navarre—have full fiscal autonomy. Aside of fiscal autonomy, the nationalities—Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Galicia—were devolved more powers {{than the rest of the}} communities, among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time. In addition, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre have police corps of their own: Ertzaintza, Mossos d'Esquadra and the Policía Foral respectively. Other communities have more limited forces or none at <b>all,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Policía Autónoma Andaluza in Andalusia or the BESCAM in Madrid.|$|E
25|$|However, Charlotte did {{not allow}} herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, {{coincidence}} came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone {{in the dining room}} she noticed a small notebook lying open on in the drawer of Emily's portable writing desk and of my sister Emily's handwriting. She read it and was dazzled by the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt, more than surprise , a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at <b>all</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music – wild, melancholy, and elevating. In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.|$|E

25|$|The oldest {{translation}} of the Bible in Greek is known as Septuagint. Tradition propagated by the so-called Letter of Aristeas ascribes it in its entirety {{to a group of}} seventy Jewish scholars working at the order of Ptolemy II Philadelphus who ruled Egypt from 285 to 246 BCE. Modern research, however, indicates that the letter is a late-2nd-century BCE forgery and the account is mostly legendary. In actuality, the translation was probably carried out in stages between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC and was the work of Greek-speaking Jews of the Diaspora. The only indication for dating the {{translation of}} the Book of Job in that chronological framework is an excerpt from a Hellenistic–Judaic work (ʺΠερί Ἰουδαίωνʺ) by the above-mentioned Alexandrian historian Aristeas. This excerpt, which was incorporated by Alexander Polyhistor in his compilation and thus was preserved by Eusebius, contains a brief biography of Job. The striking similarity between this and appendices contained in most Greek manuscripts of the Book of Job (in addition to that, the excerpt – according to the prevailing view – presupposes the Greek {{translation of the}} Septuagint), leads {{to the conclusion that the}} Book of Job in the Greek translation was known to a writer (Aristeas) before the time of Alexander Polyhistor, that is, about the middle of the 2nd century BC. Furthermore, this date conforms to and confirms the general impression given by the Greek text that it is genuinely Hellenistic, created by and familiar to circles relatively alien to a solely Judaic way of thinking. The character of the Septuagint text mentioned above, which undertakes to give the genealogy of Job and to identify his three friends, is not the only significant deviation-addition peculiar to the Greek edition. The text of the Book of Job shows so many extensive and essential differences from the Hebrew original, that one must infer either deliberate modification of the prototype, at least to a certain extent, by the Greek translator or the use of a prototype unknown today. The most striking peculiarity is the extensive omissions noted and commented on quite early. According to Origen (AD 184-254), the Greek text of the Septuagint was shorter by one sixth than the Hebrew, whereas St. Jerome testifies to a difference of over one fourth. To these omissions, which at present are estimated to total about 187 verses, must be added the abbreviations as well as the padding of frequently free translation, amounting to a paraphrase of the prototype, which all show not only that there was a tendency to abbreviate the prototype but also that the translator apparently does not seem to have troubled himself extensively with the most difficult passages. The passages constituting a plain transcript into Greek of the Hebrew prototype are particularly notable in this respect. Aside from the translator’s obvious difficulties with the text, recent studies indicate that the proven deviations were deliberate rather than a consequence merely of the translator’s inadequacy. Examined in this light, the Septuagint text seems to express a particular theological tendency, evident in “emendations” of a dogmatic nature, which subsequently permeates the entire Book of Job. The main lines of this new theological approach to the “problem of Job” may be summarized as follows: In the first place, by presenting the devil as the main author of Job’s misfortune, God is generally portrayed much milder than in the Hebrew original. Secondly, there is the tendency in the speeches to moderate the intensity of Job’s polemic on God’s will and conception of justice. Thus the Job of the Septuagint translation is not at <b>all</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Job of the Hebrew prototype. This is so, not only because his speeches in the Septuagint are less provocative in tone, but also because a new element of patient submission and humility, unknown in the prototype, has been introduced here for the first time. These modifications which will turn out to be the chief characteristics of the hero of the story as presented in the Testament of Job will also be the basic element of the mediaeval Christian tradition in which Job appears as a big sufferer –the very model of patience and justice. The friends’ speeches have been similarly “emended”. Those of Elihu especially seem to have experienced more serious alterations. The main consequences of all these changes is that Job’s standpoint is not clearly discerned from that of his friends, and, therefore, the problem itself is no longer as prominently outlined as in the prototype. The development of this dogmatic expunging culminates in the Testament of Job, where the atrophied dialogue does not preserve even a trace of the philosophical-theological analysis of the problem provided in the original poem. The Testament of Job is therefore thought by several scholars to be based entirely on the Greek translation. Before concluding this brief survey of the textual problems, the remaining Greek translations must also be mentioned, since they were taken into account by the Church Fathers in their commentaries on the Book of Job and could, therefore, have a bearing on the iconography.|$|E
500|$|The Brothers Poem {{seems to}} have been part of a series of poems about Sappho's brothers, though David Gribble disagrees with this conclusion. Anton Bierl {{identifies}} seven other fragments of Sappho which seem to have dealt with Charaxos or Doricha. [...] Fragments 5, 15, and 17 <b>all,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Brothers Poem, focus on homecomings; fragments 5 and 15 are both likely to be about Charaxos, and Anton Bierl suggests that fragment 17, a cultic hymn referring to Menelaus' visit to Lesbos {{on his way home from}} Troy, may be a prayer for a safe journey for Charaxos. [...] Four other surviving fragments of Sappho, 3, 7, 9, and 20, may all have been connected with the story of Charaxos and Doricha.|$|E
500|$|The {{selection}} of one particular quote in Carr's essay from pathologist Bruce Friedman, {{a member of}} the faculty of the University of Michigan Medical School, who commented on a developing difficulty reading books and long essays and specifically the novel War and Peace, was criticized for having a bias toward narrative literature. The quote failed to represent other types of literature, such as technical and scientific literature, which had, in contrast, become much more accessible and widely read {{with the advent of the}} Internet. At the Britannica Blog, writer Clay Shirky pugnaciously observed that War and Peace was [...] "too long, and not so interesting", further stating that [...] "it would be hard to argue that the last ten years have seen a decrease in either the availability or comprehension of material on scientific or technical subjects". Shirky's comments on War and Peace were derided by several of his peers as verging on philistinism. In Shirky's defense, inventor W. Daniel Hillis asserted that, although books [...] "were created to serve a purpose", that [...] "same purpose can often be served by better means". While Hillis considered the book to be [...] "a fine and admirable device", he imagined that clay tablets and scrolls of papyrus, in their time, [...] "had charms of their own". Wired magazine editor Kevin Kelly believed that the idea that [...] "the book is the apex of human culture" [...] should be resisted. And Birkerts differentiated online reading from literary reading, stating that in the latter the reader is directed within themselves and enters [...] "an environment that is nothing at <b>all</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> open-ended information zone that is cyberspace" [...] in which he feels psychologically fragmented.|$|E

Released on October 10, 1966, [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] was the Beach Boys' third US number one hit after [...] "I Get Around" [...] (1964) and [...] "Help Me, Rhonda" [...] (1965), reaching {{the top of the}} Hot 100 in December, as well as being their first number one in Britain. In contemporaneous interviews, Wilson stated that the group's next album Smile (originally called Dumb Angel) was to be [...] "a teenage symphony to God", and that [...] "It will be as much an improvement over [...] Sounds as that was over Summer Days." [...] A Los Angeles Times West Magazine piece by Tom Nolan focused on the contradictions between Wilson's [...] "suburban" [...] demeanor and the reputation that preceded him ("he doesn’t look at <b>all</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> seeming leader of a potentially-revolutionary movement in pop music"). When asked where he believes music will go, Wilson responds: [...] "White spirituals, I think that’s what we're going to hear. Songs of faith." [...] At the end of 1966, NME conducted a reader's poll that placed Wilson as the fourth-ranked [...] "World Music Personality"—about 1,000 votes ahead of Bob Dylan and 500 behind John Lennon.|$|E
