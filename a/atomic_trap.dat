40|$|We discuss {{computational}} {{aspects of}} the developed mathematical models for ultracold few-body processes in <b>atomic</b> <b>traps.</b> The key element of the elaborated computational schemes is a nondirect product discrete variable representation (npDVR) we have suggested and applied to the time-dependent and stationary Schrödinger equations with a few spatial variables. It turned out that this approach is very effcient in quantitative analysis of low-dimensional ultracold few-body systems arising in confined geometry of <b>atomic</b> <b>traps.</b> The effciency of the method is demonstrated here on two examples.

50|$|The central atom {{in these}} endohedral {{complexes}} {{is located in}} the center of the cage. While other atomic traps require complex equipment, e.g. laser cooling or magnetic traps, endohedral fullerenes represent an <b>atomic</b> <b>trap</b> that is stable at room temperature and for an arbitrarily long time. Atomic or ion traps are of great interest since particles are present free from (significant) interaction with their environment, allowing unique quantum mechanical phenomena to be explored. For example, the compression of the atomic wave function as a consequence of the packing in the cage could be observed with ENDOR spectroscopy. The nitrogen atom can be used as a probe, in order to detect the smallest changes of the electronic structure of its environment.|$|E

The Markov approximation is crucial in most theoretical descriptions of an atom laser that assume a continuous process of output coupling from a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. In this regime many techniques proved to be useful for modeling the optical laser, such as master equations, can be used to describe the dynamics of the damping of the condensate mode undergoing output coupling.

40|$|Quantum {{evolution}} of a collective mode of a Bose-Einstein condensate containing a finite number N of particles shows the phenomena of collapses and revivals. The characteristic collapse time depends on the scattering length, the initial amplitude of the mode and N. The corresponding time values have been derived analytically under certain approximation and numerically for the parabolic <b>atomic</b> <b>trap.</b> The revival of the mode at time of several seconds, as a direct evidence of the effect, can occur, if the normal component is significantly suppressed.

40|$|Alongside superfluidity, {{itinerant}} (Stoner) ferromagnetism {{remains one}} of the most well-characterized phases of correlated Fermi systems. A recent experiment has reported the first evidence for novel phase behavior on the repulsive side of the Feshbach resonance in a two-component ultracold Fermi gas. By adapting recent theoretical studies to the <b>atomic</b> <b>trap</b> geometry, we show that an adiabatic ferromagnetic transition would take place at a weaker interaction strength than is observed in experiment. This discrepancy motivates a simple non-equilibrium theory that takes account of the dynamics of magnetic defects and three-body losses.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} constructing an experiment which detects the atomic stimulation of a photon emission process. A beam of atoms (bosons) in an excited state is passed over an <b>atomic</b> <b>trap</b> which traps the atoms {{when they are in}} their internal ground state. When the trap contains a Bose-Einstein condensate, the cross-section for absorption of the atomic beam is increased. We examine a particular model in which this atom-stimulation is observable, and is also characterised by the emission of photons in a narrow cone {{in the direction of the}} atomic beam.

We discuss the shape of the trapping potentials for different field geometries, as well as the possibility of nonadiabatic transitions to untrapped states, i. e., the analog of Majorana transitions in a quadrupole magnetic <b>atomic</b> <b>trap.</b> Maximizing the lifetime of molecules in a trap is of great concern in current experiments, and we assess the effect of nonadiabatic transitions on obtainable trap lifetimes.

40|$|Shear {{viscosity}} of {{a two-dimensional}} Fermi liquid {{is found to}} be a nonanalytic function of temperature. In contrast to the quasiparticle lifetime that is determined by the forward-scattering processes, the main contribution to the viscosity arises from the quasiparticle scattering in the Cooper channel. The viscosity is enhanced by the logarithmic singularity of the vertex part. This singular behavior can manifest itself in the two-dimensional electron transport, and in the momentum relaxation of fermions in <b>atomic</b> <b>traps.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

In this paper, we confine our attention to the zero temperature case, although the treatment can be generalized to finite temperatures, as we shall discuss elsewhere.

We use the electron-hole pair states in coupled double quantum-dot molecules to encode quantum information, where the requirement that two quantum dots are exactly identical is not necessary. Our idea can also be generalized to other systems, such as <b>atomic,</b> <b>trapped</b> ion and linear optics system. Comment: 4 pages and 2 figure...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the properties of a standing-wave configuration of Gaussian laser beams which gives a linear array of three-dimensional atomic dipole traps. This is achieved by two counter-propagating waves with different beam waists so that at the nodes the field intensity of the standing wave is not completely cancelled at all radial positions across the beam. This creates an intensity dip in both the axial and radial directions {{that can be used}} as an <b>atomic</b> <b>trap</b> for blue detuning of the light.

40|$|The {{theory of}} an atom dipole trap {{composed}} of a focused, far red-detuned, trapping laser beam, {{and a pair of}} red-detuned, counterpropagating, cooling beams is developed for the simplest realistic multilevel dipole interaction scheme based on a model of a (3 + 5) -level atom. The description of atomic motion in the trap is based on the quantum kinetic equations for the atomic density matrix and the reduced quasiclassical kinetic equation for atomic distribution function. It is shown that when the detuning of the trapping field is much larger than the detuning of the cooling field, and with low saturation, the one-photon absorption (emission) processes responsible for the trapping potential can be well separated from the two-photon processes responsible for sub-Doppler cooling atoms in the trap. Two conditions are derived that are necessary and sufficient for stable <b>atomic</b> <b>trapping.</b> The conditions show that stable <b>atomic</b> <b>trapping</b> in the optical dipole trap can be achieved when the trapping field has no effect on the two-photon cooling process and when the cooling field does not change the structure of the trapping potential but changes only the numerical value of the trapping potential well. It is concluded that the separation of the trapping and cooling processes in a pure optical dipole trap allows one to cool trapped atoms down to a minimum temperature close to the recoil temperature, keeping simultaneously a deep potential well...|$|R
