The impact of current and alternative land use needs to be investigated {{in order to determine}} appropriate land management strategies to maintain or obtain good water quality. The influence of relief at the erosion risk is usually calculated by the LS topographic factor from the Universal Soil Loss Equation USLE and its derivations. This work evaluates the influence of the grid spacing in Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) on the determination of the LS topographic factor for the Rio Conceição hydrographic basic RS. The DEMs employed in this study are those from the STRM mission (90 m) and TOPODATA project (30 m) and one generated from the <b>topographic</b> <b>charts</b> published by the Geographic Service Directorate of the Brazilian Armed Forces with a 1 : 50. 000 scale (20 m).

The classification {{was made by the}} following four steps: 1) first, the images were geometrically corrected using as reference a <b>topographic</b> <b>chart</b> of scale 1 : 50. 000 (IBGE); 2) to reduce the differential terrain illumination on satellite images, a simple method of cosine correction was applied on the images using a digital elevation model (DEM) derived from the topographic chart; 3) then, the images were segmented using a region-growing algorithm; 4) lastly, the segments were grouped by adopting a supervised classifier by region named Bhattacharya. The results show that the adopted procedures were very useful for mapping the coffee crops. The topographic normalization showed to be effective, since it contributed to reduce the differential terrains illumination and increase the segmentation performance as well. Using reference information acquired by means of <b>topographic</b> <b>charts,</b> field campaign and Google Earth, a training sample set was collected to perform the classification. Two coffee classes were discriminated: coffee- 1 (coffee in formation) and coffee- 2 (production coffee). Although, there have been some misclassification (inclusion and exclusion errors) involving mainly coffee- 1 with coffee 2 and coffee- 2 with forest, the classification results were considered satisfactory and showed the potential of the medium spatial resolution satellite images for mapping the coffee crops.

40|$|Abstract: Digital {{aerial photo}} mosaics and NOAA <b>topographic</b> survey <b>charts</b> (t-sheets) {{are used to}} map {{historical}} shoreline positions on southeast Oahu, Hawaii. The new PX (Polynomial in alongshore X) and PXT (Polynomial in X and Time) shoreline change rate methods are applied to calculate shoreline change rates from the time series of historical shoreline positions. These new methods utilize all historical shoreline data from a beach to calculate shoreline change rates and can find acceleration in the shoreline change rate with time. The methods are shown here and in previous works to produce more parsimonious models and more statistically significant and defensible rates than the previously used ST (Single-Transect) shoreline change rate calculation method. The ability to model acceleration in shoreline change rates with time provides insight into shoreline change processes, which was previously theoretical or observed in only small-scale studies. An overview of the methods is presented along with results from shoreline change analysis of four beach study sites on the southeast Oahu, Hawaii, shoreline. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{short summary}} helps {{to grasp the}} motive behind the research, its {{objectives}} {{and to find out}} what is presented on the following pages of the report. It offers a condensed, one page recapitulation of its contents and intentions and suggests who might be interested to read it. CONTEXT Map generalisation is a tedious task, requiring skilled cartographers to work for long periods of time. Experience shows that compiling a map can take several months. It is the common wisdom that such labour?intensive tasks should be consigned to computers and thus be accomplished more uniformly, more precisely, more rapidly, and at much reduced cost (Buttenfield & McMaster, 1991). The benefits of automatic generalisation could aid hydrographic offices (HOs) in their ENC creation. OBJECTIVES The aim of the project is to create ‘hard knowledge’ specifications that could be subsequently used to create/use with tools for automatic generalisation of ENCs. The research compiles requirements of various HOs with the recommendations of S? 4 and knowledge in model and cartographic generalisation of <b>topographic</b> <b>charts</b> to create computer translatable rules that allow creating a smaller scale/usage ENCs from a higher scale/usage ENC / S? 57 data without or with minimum human interference. DELIVERABLES AND THEIR IMPACT The final report present a set of specifications, rules and tools that allow going from one compilation scale (Approach) to another (Coastal) without or with minimum human interference. It also discusses shortcomings and rate of success of such approach. The study mainly bases on the existing generalisation operators available in the literature, but where it is just? points out scarceness of the choice and proposes new solutions. As a result, an IHO standard could be created for the generalisation of charts (ENCs) and tools implemented in the software used for chart creation. WHO SHOULD READ THIS REPORT? This report might be found interesting by the GIS community, especially when interested in advancements in digital cartography and ENCs. The main recipients, however, are the hydrographic community, mainly Hydrographic Offices, and hydrographic software vendors. They may find ideas for potential implementations that could aid their business. The secondary recipients could be other parties linked to Electronic Navigational Charts, namely ECDIS producers and chart users. The author hopes that this research could also inspire other projects on automatic chart generalisation and complement projects on bathymetric generalisation.

40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{contributing}} to {{the knowledge of the}} taxonomy and ecology of the species of Geastrum, three priority regions for conservation of biodiversity from Sonora, Mexico were sampled. The survey was conducted during the four seasons of the year in six vegetation types. Sampling localities were characterized by biotic and abiotic factors based upon <b>topographic</b> and subject <b>charts</b> as well as physical and chemical soil analyses. Seventeen species of Geastrum were determined, six are reported for the first time from Sonora, G. pouzarii and G. pseudolimbatum being new records for the Mexican mycobiota. The highest number of specimens were collected in tropical thorn forest and tropical deciduous forest. Although gastrocarps of Geastrum were observed throughout the year, they were more commonly found during summer and autumn...|$|R

They soon learned to produce maps as good as their teacher’s, and eventually even better. But they had probably listened well when Petermann pointed out the need for an improvement in map lettering, in elevation figures (though elevation and bathymetric figures were common in <b>topographic</b> maps and <b>charts,</b> Petermann was the first to include them in geographic maps), more accurate engraving and better coloring, for under his directions the maps of the Stieler became more uniform in expression. In this they were also guided by the more than consistent work of Vogel, and Von Sydow’s critical remarks concerning {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} certain styles in his Kartographischen Standpunkt Europas.|$|R
