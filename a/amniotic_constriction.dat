40|$|The <b>amniotic</b> (<b>constriction)</b> band {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} distal ring constrictions, intrauterine amputations, and acrosyndactyly. External constriction by amniotic bands is the generally accepted mechanism: early amniotic rupture leads to formation of mesodermal fibrous strands that constrict, entangle, and amputate distal portions of limbs. Etiology is heterogeneous. Anecdotal cases involving central nervous system abnormalities (e. g., acrania, anencephaly, polymicrogyria, congenital bilateral perisylvian syndrome, neuronal heterotopia, septo-optic dysplasia, and spinal cord tethering) have been reported. We describe a 9 -year-old girl with typical features of constriction band syndrome localized to the lower limbs who had also profound mental retardation and drug-resistant epilepsy associated with bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia (a brain malformation of neuronal migration and proliferation caused by mutations in the X-linked filamin 1 gene [FLN 1] on chromosome Xq 28). The karyotype was normal, as was mutational screening for FLN 1. The occurrence of bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia {{in the context of}} amniotic band {{syndrome is}} novel (chance occurrence of both: 0. 000004 %). Â© 2007 Elsevier Inc.

5000|$|<b>Amniotic</b> band <b>{{constriction}}</b> (also {{known as}} [...] "amniotic band syndrome", [...] "ADAM complex", [...] "Amniotic band sequence", [...] "Congenital constriction bands" [...] and [...] "Pseudoainhum") is a congenital disorder caused by entrapment of fetal parts (usually a limb or digits) in fibrous amniotic bands while in utero.|$|R
40|$|A {{mother and}} son with Ehlers-Danlos {{syndrome}} (EDS) type IV and unusual congenital anomalies are described. The congenital anomalies include, in the mother, <b>amniotic</b> band-like <b>constrictions</b> on one hand, a unilateral clubfoot, and macrocephaly owing to normal-pressure hydrocephaly and, in the son, an esophageal atresia and hydrocephaly. Protein analysis of collagen III in cultured fibroblasts of the mother showed no abnormalities. However, DNA analysis of the COL 3 A 1 gene revealed a pathogenic mutation (388 G [...] >T) in both {{the mother and the}} son. The possible relationship between the observed congenital anomalies and EDS IV are discussed. We stress that DNA analysis of COL 3 A 1 should be performed in all patients when there is a strong suspicion of EDS IV, despite negative findings in a collagen protein analysis...|$|R
40|$|Ashutosh HalderDepartment of Reproductive Biology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, IndiaAbstract: Six {{cases of}} amniotic band syndrome/limb body wall complex were studied {{in respect to}} clinicopathologic characteristics. The {{diagnosis}} was based on {{two out of three}} of the following manifestations: cranio facial clefts; limb body wall defects and amniotic band attachment. Four cases were stillborn and associated with internal defects, including central nervous system. Two cases had facial and limb defects and were live born (3 &ndash; 5 years old at examination). Phenotypic features of the stillborn cases were craniofacial clefting, thoracoabdominoschisis, amputation, ring <b>constriction,</b> <b>amniotic</b> band adhesion, placental adhesions, and internal malformations. Histology of bands revealed fibroconnective tissue as well as flattened epithelial cells together with neuroectodermal elements. Umbilical cord section revealed an abnormal number of vessels. When analyzing the observed data in relation to their etiology, it was found that amniotic disruption, vascular disruption or genetic disruption could explain the amniotic band syndrome/limb body wall complexes, alone or in combinations. A brief review of literature in search of pathogenesis is offered along with an etiopathogenetic model. Keywords: amniotic band syndrome, limb body wall complex and pathogenesi...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground/PurposeIn fetuses with gastroschisis, toxic {{products}} in the <b>amniotic</b> fluid and <b>constriction</b> at the defect of the abdominal wall are considered causative of damage to the eviscerated bowel. The {{aim of this study}} was to cover the eviscerated bowel in gastroschisis with a collagen scaffold to protect the bowel and induce cell growth into the scaffold, which could lead to skin or abdominal wall formation replacing the scaffold. MethodsIn 12 fetal lambs gastroschisis was surgically created at 79 days gestation. A dual-layer type I collagen scaffold was sutured into the skin of the abdominal wall around the defect covering the eviscerated bowel. Lambs were examined after caesarean section at 140 days' gestation. ResultsSurvival was 67 %. In 7 of 8 surviving lambs the bowel was found to be covered after birth. One scaffold had ruptured. The bowel was found repositioned in the abdominal cavity in 5 lambs. In 2 lambs it was still partially outside. Only minor adherence of bowel loops and no fibrous peel formation were seen. Connective tissue and skin tissue replaced the scaffold. ConclusionsPrenatal coverage of the bowel in experimental gastroschisis with a collagen scaffold is feasible in fetal lambs, significantly diminished damage to the bowel wall, and skin and connective tissue replaced the scaffold. This technique may be promising in the care of fetuses with this congenital anomaly...|$|R
