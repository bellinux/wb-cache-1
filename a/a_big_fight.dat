5|$|Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) asks Andy (Chris Pratt), April (Aubrey Plaza), Jerry (Jim O'Heir) and Donna (Retta) to {{participate}} in a new game show called Know Ya Boo, that he is hoping to pitch to networks; he admits that it is a rip-off of The Newlywed Game. It quickly becomes clear that Jerry and Donna know much more about each other than the recently married Andy and April. When April reveals her favorite band is Neutral Milk Hotel and not Andy's band Mouse Rat, Andy angrily leaves the game and they later have <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fight</b> which causes him to quit his music. April seeks advice from Ann because, although she dislikes her, Ann previously dated Andy for several years. Ann tells April she has to be supportive of Andy no matter how she feels. The next day, April brings the other members of Mouse Rat to city hall and surprises Andy by singing one of his songs. A thrilled Andy reconciles with April.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{were divided}} about Rick Grimes' return to Atlanta, {{as well as}} his stand off with Guillermo and his gang. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic {{compared}} Grimes to Mad Men Don Draper, and questioned his character development: [...] "So far, every decision Rick has made has been both within his code and consequence-free," [...] he said. Pierce opined: [...] "Dramatically, this whole sequence plays out pretty hokily. Guillermo's dialogue is ridiculous, and the entire storyline plays like something out of an episodic social-lesson-of-the-week show. Since nothing ends up coming of it from a plot standpoint , it's hard not {{to think of it as}} one of those comics where two [...] have <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fight</b> scene that turns out to be mistaken identity." ...|$|E

500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fight</b> right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E
500|$|Up {{until the}} {{production}} of season ten in 1998, these six main voice actors were paid $30,000 per episode. In 1998, a salary dispute {{between them and the}} Fox Broadcasting Company arose, with the actors threatening to strike. Fox went as far as preparing for casting of new voices, but an agreement was soon made and their salaries were raised to $125,000 per episode. Groening expressed his sympathy for the actors in an issue of Mother Jones a while after the salary dispute had been settled. He told the magazine: [...] " [...] are incredibly talented, and they deserve a chance to be as rich and miserable as anyone else in Hollywood." [...] The show also made a change for the writers to become signatories to the Animation Guild. Most writers in animation belong to the guild, but The Simpsons as well as other animated shows on Fox were different. Scully commented that [...] "everyone expected <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fight</b> with the studio" [...] and continued that [...] "it never materialized, because they conceded that prime-time animation was successful and everyone was benefiting." ...|$|E

One day they have <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>fight</b> than normal, which causes something inexplicable to happen: they switch bodies. Terrified, Claudio and Helena try to appear normal until they can reverse the situation. But to do so they will have to fully assume each other's lives.|$|R
50|$|Dusty's next fight {{has yet to}} be {{scheduled}} but he is looking to return to action in the summer. Usually a very active fighter, this has been the longest layoff of his career, which is partially due to having an injured wrist for two months. He was scheduled to compete on a local club show on March 25th against Matthew Strode (24-4) at the UDC where he headlined a card in May 2013, but decided to pull out because he is looking for <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>fight.</b>|$|R

[...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>fight</b> than they've ever had coming on up there, {{and this is the first}} gun.

It was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fight.</b> The soldiers got just what they deserved this time. No good soldiers would shoot into an Indian’s tepee where there were women and children. These soldiers did, and we fought for our women and children. White men {{would do the same}} if they were men." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between flops, it is true, I {{have come}} up with an {{occasional}} hit, but compared to a good boxer's record, for instance, my percentage has been lamentable. I fought a draw in my first fight, stupified everyone by winning the championship in my second, got a couple of wins with picture rights, then was knocked out three times in a row. Dragging my weary carcass to Hollywood, I was immediately knocked out again, won <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fight</b> some six months later, then marked time for six years as an ordinary ham-and-beaner, picking up what I could. Suddenly I saw a chance and offered to fight for the world championship for a dollar. To everyone's astonishment, I won that championship and defended it successfully for a number of years, winning nine times by knockout, fighting three draws, losing twice and getting one no-decision in Europe. I have just come over to America for a fight, but it was called off at the last moment, one of the promoters having gone nuts and having to have been locked up. Why I'm not walking on my heels after all this, I don't know. Maybe I am walking on my heels. [...] It would be surprising if I weren't.|$|E
2500|$|Shredder unleashes Tokka and Rahzar into {{a nearby}} {{neighborhood}} to cause damages. The next day, Freddy {{sends a message to}} April that Tokka and Rahzar will be released into Central Park if the Turtles don't meet the Foot Clan at the construction site. Perry develops an antidote to the mutations and when they confront the two, Leonardo and Michelangelo trick Tokka and Rahzar into eating it. They discover the trick and brutally attack, throwing Raphael into a public dance club. <b>A</b> <b>big</b> <b>fight</b> ensues among hundreds of witnesses and eventually the turtles turn Tokka and Rahzar into their natural state, while Vanilla Ice improvises the [...] "Ninja Rap". Shredder attacks, threatening a citizen with a final vial of ooze, but Keno intervenes and the turtles overload an amplifier, causing Shredder to be blasted out onto the docks behind the club. They follow and discover that Shredder had drunk the last vial, transforming into a [...] "Super Shredder" [...] with immense super strength, who begins to destroy the support structure holding the dock up. Not caring about his own life, Shredder attempts to kill the turtles by collapsing the dock on top of them, but the group escapes the collapse using their aquatic nature, and surface in time to witness Shredder's last breath.|$|E

2500|$|The Wágluȟe {{were aware}} {{of the power of the}} whites, their {{overwhelming}} numbers and the futility of war. Traditionally, in intertribal warfare, a fight among fifty warriors in which two men were killed was considered <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fight.</b> The Wágluȟe at Ft. Laramie heard of the 50,000 casualties of the three-day Battle at Gettysburg in July 1863, and knew what white men meant when they spoke of battle. The Wágluȟe observed and learned the customs of the whites. Wágluȟe were considered by the U.S. Army and Indian agents to be the most progressive band of Lakota and many became Indian Police, U.S. Army Indian Scouts with the U.S. 4th Cavalry Regiment from Ft. Laramie and intermediaries with other bands of Lakotas. The Wágluȟe formed a civil administration at Ft. Laramie, and Old Chief Smoke appointed Blue Horse and Big Mouth the first Indian Police officers. The Wágluȟe were first Oglala Lakota to send their children to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, for a formal education. Wágluȟe U.S. Army Indian Scouts were a “Band of Brothers” with U.S. Army Cavalry Scouts and later were the first Oglala Lakota to travel with Col.

2500|$|Despite winning on the undercard, a {{fight between}} Briggs and Haye didn't materialize. Brigg's {{continued}} to call out Haye, asking him to honor {{his end of the}} agreement. Briggs also chased Haye down in Brooklyn when both were in attendance for the Frampton vs. Santa Cruz fight. In October, Haye spoke out about the fight not taking place {{due to the fact that}} Briggs wanted the fight to be on ppv, [...] "Because the fight can't happen on pay-per-view ... I like people thinking I'm running from him and ducking him because when I do get in the ring with him, which I really think I will do, I think it will make it <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>fight.</b> But at the moment the fight can't happen because he will only fight me if the fight is on pay-per-view.

5000|$|The NSAC stood {{firm with}} a 4-1 vote {{and were not}} willing to remove Halpern (whom one sports writer {{referred}} to as [...] "the unwilling centerpiece of a manufactured controversy"). The day before the fight was to occur, Halpern voluntarily withdrew.

However, dating partner communication apprehension following the first <b>big</b> <b>fight</b> was significantly lower for survivors than non-survivors. In addition, survivors report a lessening of apprehension {{over the course of}} the FBF while non-survivors report a growing sense of apprehension. This targeted dating partner communication apprehension was significantly related to elements of targeted self-disclosure that are critical to continued maintenance and growth of interpersonal relationships.
