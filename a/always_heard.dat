25|$|Depictions of rats {{in fiction}} are {{historically}} inaccurate and negative. The most common falsehood is the squeaking almost <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> in otherwise realistic portrayals (i.e. nonanthropomorphic). While the recordings {{may be of}} actual squeaking rats, the noise is uncommon – they may do so only if distressed, hurt, or annoyed. Normal vocalizations are very high-pitched, well outside the range of human hearing. Rats are also often cast in vicious and aggressive roles when in fact, their shyness helps keep them undiscovered for so long in an infested home.|$|E
25|$|On 21 April 1566 Sir Richard Sackville, the then-chancellor of the exchequer, died, and Mildmay was {{appointed}} as his replacement; {{he was also}} made auditor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Busily occupied in the duties of his offices until his death, he concerned himself little with general politics. As the brother-in-law of Francis Walsingham and the friend of Lord Burghley, he was, however, <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> with attention in the Privy Council, the Star Chamber, and in Parliament. He used what influence he possessed to shield the Puritans from the attacks of the bishops, and often urged the Queen to intervene {{on behalf of the}} Protestants in the Low Countries In his speeches in Parliament he argued that a liberal grant of subsidies placed the government under an obligation to redress grievances, and thus identified himself with the popular party in the commons.|$|E
25|$|A. L. Goodhart, Professor at Oxford, {{opposed the}} view that, because the judges were {{appointed}} by the victors, the Tribunal was not impartial {{and could not be}} regarded as a court in the true sense. He wrote: Attractive as this argument may sound in theory, it ignores the fact that it runs counter to the administration of law in every country. If it were true then no spy could be given a legal trial, because his case is <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> by judges representing the enemy country. Yet no one has ever argued that in such cases it was necessary to call on neutral judges. The prisoner has the right to demand that his judges shall be fair, but not that they shall be neutral. As Lord Writ has pointed out, the same principle is applicable to ordinary criminal law because 'a burglar cannot complain that he is being tried by a jury of honest citizens'.|$|E

500|$|Along {{with the}} palatine, the judge royal and the ban, the voivode {{was one of}} the Kingdom's highest judges. In this capacity, he was {{authorized}} to issue [...] "credible" [...] charters. The earliest preserved charter dates to 1248. The voivodes or their vice-voivodes <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> disputes together with local noblemen who knew local customs. Initially, the voivodes and their deputies held their courts at Marosszentimre (Sântimbru), but they heard disputes at their own abodes from the 14thcentury. Voivodes rarely headed their courts after the 1340s and were rather represented by their deputies.|$|E

Coming so quickly after my decision to stay on the radio, this was quite an irony. I was given one day of training... from one minute to zero, at which point you have to say goodbye. I did not find that easy at all... I made a real hash of it after one of the early games..... very kindly, suggested a plan... as soon as the count started in our earpieces I would ask him a question, and he would talk until the count reached eight seconds to go. I would then thank him, turn to the camera and tell the audience briefly about the next game to be televised. Miraculously, {{for the rest of the}} tournament I <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> 'zero' in my ear at the moment I said goodbye... the whole experience served to confirm my belief that my decision to stick with Test Match Special was the right one." ...|$|E

Orzack believes that the root of gaming addiction comes from the need of excitement in life, stating that [...] "these people are avoiding their own problems. Some of them want excitement, some of them want relief". She also stated that the numbers of computer game addicts in the United States is high, although actual figures are unclear. Orzack felt {{that many of those}} she treated for computer game addiction were in their 40's or older, with them being almost exclusively male. She stated that she almost <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> of a case of this type after it has caused problems with someone's job or marriage.|$|E
2500|$|In 465 BCE, the playwrights {{began using}} a {{backdrop}} or scenic wall, which hung or {{stood behind the}} orchestra, which also served as an area where actors could change their costumes. It {{was known as the}} skênê (from which the word [...] "scene" [...] derives). The death of a character was <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> behind the skênê, for it was considered inappropriate to show a killing in view of the audience. Conversely, there are scholarly arguments that death in Greek tragedy was portrayed off stage primarily because of dramatic considerations, and not prudishness or sensitivity of the audience. In 425 BC a stone scene wall, called a paraskenia, became a common supplement to skênê in the theatres. A paraskenia was a long wall with projecting sides, which may have had doorways for entrances and exits. Just behind the paraskenia was the proskenion. The proskenion ("in front of the scene") was beautiful, and was similar to the modern day proscenium.|$|E

5000|$|This is {{a musical}} term that {{identifies}} {{the key of}} a piece, not always audible ... the key might stray from the original, but it will return.

They are created by nature (geography and climate): wind, water, forests, plains, birds, insects, animals. In many urban areas, traffic has become the keynote sound.|$|R
2500|$|Among {{his many}} philanthropic efforts, the {{establishment}} of public libraries throughout the United States, Britain, Canada and other English-speaking countries was especially prominent. In this special driving interest and project of his he {{was inspired by a}} visit and tour he made with Enoch Pratt (1808–1896), formerly of Massachusetts but who made his fortune in Baltimore and ran his various mercantile and financial businesses very thriftily. Pratt in turn had been inspired and helped by his friend and fellow Bay Stater, George Peabody, (1795–1869) who also had made his fortune in the [...] "Monumental City" [...] of Baltimore before moving to New York and London to expand his empire as the richest man in America before the Civil War. Later he too endowed several institutions, schools, libraries and foundations in his home commonwealth, and also in Baltimore with his Peabody Institute in 1857, completed in 1866, with added library wings a decade later and several educational foundations throughout the Old South. Several decades later, Carnegie's visit with Mr. Pratt lasted for several days; resting and dining in his city mansion, then touring, visiting and talking with staff and ordinary citizen patrons of the newly established Enoch Pratt Free Library (1886) impressed the Scotsman deeply – years later he was <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> to proclaim that [...] "Pratt was my guide and inspiration".|$|E

50|$|Over the Rutenfest days (from Friday until Tuesday), several {{bands in}} {{historic}} costumes are marching {{through the city}} playing drums and fifes, pipes or fanfares.

In return, the groups are rewarded with donations to compensate their expenses, and are sometimes invited to food and drink. Around these short performances, many citizens organize garden or street parties where their friends and old classmates are also invited.
