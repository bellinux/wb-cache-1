In the 1995 Progressive Conservative leadership election Dunderdale served as co-chair of Lynn Verge's successful campaign.|$|E

However, Lewis charms the judge with a speech <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> let Audrey down, and he is sentenced to community service.

Audrey's grandson Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), who owns The Bistro, realises Lewis' communication skills could be good for his business and he employs Lewis for a trial period at the restaurant.|$|E

2500|$|Peter Debruge of Variety {{gave the}} film a mixed review: [...] "Any movie {{in which the}} {{longtime}} FBI honcho features as the central character must supply some insight into what made him tick, or suffer from the reality that the Bureau's exploits were far {{more interesting than the}} bureaucrat who ran it – a dilemma J. Edgar never rises above." [...] David Edelstein of New York Magazine reacted negatively to the film and said: [...] "It's too bad J. Edgar is so shapeless and turgid and ham-handed, so rich in bad lines and worse readings." [...] He praised DiCaprio's performance: [...] "There’s something appealingly straightforward <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> physicalizes Hoover's inner struggle, the body always slightly out of sync with the mind that vigilantly monitors every move." ...|$|E

Thousands were detained without trial during Botha's presidency, while others were tortured and killed. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission found Botha responsible for gross violations of human rights. He was also found to have directly authorised 'unlawful activity which included killing.' However, Botha refused to apologise for apartheid. In a 2006 interview to mark his 90th birthday, he suggested that he had no regrets <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> had run the country. He denied, however, that he had ever considered black South Africans to be in any way inferior to whites, but conceded that [...] "some" [...] whites did hold that view. He also claimed that the apartheid policies were inherited from the British colonial administration in the Cape and Natal Province, implying that he considered them something he and his government had followed by default.|$|E

[...] Although he had considered firing manager Johnny Keane, Busch relented; however, he secretly met with Leo Durocher to offer him the manager position for the next season. [...] Word of the meeting leaked to Keane. [...] Resolutely propelled by Brock, MVP third baseman Ken Boyer and 19-game winner Bob Gibson, the Cardinals beset the Phillies to relinquish a 6 game lead with 12 to play, and St. Louis won the league pennant. [...] Next, the Cardinals met and defeated the New York Yankees in the 1964 World Series as Gibson was named series MVP. [...] Busch changed his mind about firing Keane after the Series, but Keane, affronted <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> and Devine were treated, instead accepted the manager position with the Yankees.

2500|$|In 1946, {{he testified}} at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo, {{detailing}} his resentment at {{how he had}} been treated by the Japanese. At the Tokyo trial, Puyi became involved in a lengthy exchange with defense counsel Major Ben Bruce Blakeney about whether he was kidnapped in 1931 or not, which forced Puyi to perjure himself {{by saying that the}} statements in Johnston’s 1934 book Twilight in the Forbidden City about how he had willingly become Emperor of Manchukuo were all lies. When Blakeney mentioned that the introduction to Twilight in the Forbidden City described how Puyi had told Johnston that he had willingly gone to Manchuria in 1931, Puyi perjured himself by saying he was not in contact with Johnston in 1931, and that Johnston made things up for [...] "commercial advantage". The Australian judge, Sir William Webb, the President of the Tribunal, was often frustrated with Puyi's testimony, and chided him numerous times. At one point, when Puyi said [...] "I have not finished my answer yet", causing Webb to say [...] "Well, don't finish it". Behr described Puyi on the stand as a [...] "consistent, self-assured liar, prepared to go to any lengths to save his skin", and as a combative witness more than able to hold his own against the defense lawyers. Puyi was greatly helped as with the exception of Major Blakeney, no one at the trial had actually read Twilight in the Forbidden City or the interviews Woodhead had conducted with him in 1932, which gave Puyi much room to distort what had been written about him or said by him. Puyi greatly respected Johnston, who was a surrogate father to him, and he felt guilty <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> had repeatedly on the stand in Tokyo called Johnston a dishonest man whose book Twilight in the Forbidden City was full of lies, causing him to pray for the Buddha to ask for atonement for sullying Johnston's name.|$|E
