According to a teammate, O'Mullane's reputation as a first-rate boxer was enough to dissuade the opposition from getting into melees with his club. Harrison remembered O'Mullane as a strong, but good-tempered player, and stated that [...] "it was <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> him on the football field—even when the meeting was shoulder to shoulder, and you happened to get the trifle worst of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his final}} public {{statement}} Heath {{paid tribute to}} James Callaghan who died on 26 March 2005, saying [...] "James Callaghan was a major fixture in the political life of this country during his long and varied career. When in opposition he never hesitated to put firmly his party's case. When in office he took a smoother approach towards his supporters and opponents alike. Although he left the House of Commons in 1987 he continued to follow political life {{and it was always}} <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with him. We have lost a major figure from our political landscape".|$|E
2500|$|The Mortlockese Language is an Austronesian {{language}} spoken {{primarily on the}} Mortlock islands in Micronesia. In Mortlock culture, there is a hierarchy with chiefs called samwool. When speaking to these chiefs or to anyone of higher status, one must use honorifics (in Mortlockese called kapas pwéteete or kapas amáfel) in order to convey respect. In the Mortlockese Language, {{there are only two}} levels of speaking - common language and respectful language(honorifics). While respectful language is used when speaking to people of higher status, common language is used when speaking to anyone of the same or lesser status. One example showing the difference between respectful and common language {{can be seen in the}} word sleep. The word for sleep using common language is maúr while the word for sleep using respectful language is saipash. Along with the respectful language, there are formal greetings called tiirou or fairo that are used in meetings and gatherings. In English, some examples of formal greetings would be [...] "good evening" [...] or [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> you" [...] or [...] "how are you." [...] These formal greetings not only use words, but also gestures. It is the combination of the words and gestures that create the tiirou or fairo(formal greeting). In English a formal greeting like this would be like saying [...] "nice to meet you" [...] while offering a handshake.|$|E

The sense of growing normalcy is in many ways the main achievement of Albanian economic policy during the past 10 years, 250 and especially during the past three years. Something irreversible has been accomplished, to the extent that this can be said. Having the chance to be associated with this transition for almost 5 years, during 1991 - 95, I would like to focus more on earlier institutional reforms, some of the lessons learned, and current challenges Albania is facing at present...|$|R

I {{would like to}} thank Eitan, my supervisor, for his many {{suggestions}} and constant support during this small research. I am also thankful for the two Lebanese of the team Ahmad and Sara for they have been a support to me, and they encourage me on the road of the research. My companion of the office, Urtzi, was my example in the manner he works. I thank him, because he was gentle and a man of peace. I thank Bala for he helped me in his knowledge, and he was present to listen to me. I thank Tania for she was always smiling, and present in the critical situations. Each day my first good morning was to Florence, I wish to here good days full of graces. It was <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> Robin.

5000|$|Initial {{critical}} {{response to}} Grace/Wastelands was positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 74, based on 22 reviews. Though critics {{were a lot}} more fond of the record than Doherty's last two efforts, the album did not sell as well as was expected, particularly in the UK - peaking only at 17 in the UK Top 40. However, Q stated that the album was impressive, awarding it 4/5 and stating the album [...] "demolishes the charge that his talent has been fatally squandered" [...] although it did state it isn't the [...] "defining statement" [...] of genius his fans insist is round the corner. [...] Similarly, The Observer newspaper gave the album positive reviews, stating that the album said [...] "goodbye to Pete Libertine the Rehab King, and say hello to Peter Doherty, outstanding singer-songwriter and charismatic poet-vagabond.

40|$|It was <b>a</b> great <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> you {{all at the}} Ahmedabad meeting. I would {{once again}} like to take the {{opportunity}} to thank you for having entrusted me with the responsibility of carrying the Society forwards. There are a number of challenges faced by the Ophthalmic community. We need to work together <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> them and convert them into opportunities. I outlined them in my Presidential address at Ahmedabad and we will make a concerted effort to tackle all the issues during the year. I will look forward to your feedback on all these aspects. The issues that I referred to in my presidential address included efforts at improving the quality of ophthalmic education and training and redoubling our efforts at taking care of the problem of blindness while ensuring that the ophthalmologists get their just dues. We are trying to address these issues by two powerful subcommittees working in a time bound manner. Our recommendation regarding ophthalmic curriculum have been forwarded to the MCI. The curricula for post graduate fellowships are being finalized through the functioning of the AIOS collegium. I also alluded to the challenges posed by regulations by the medical insurance sector and medico legal issues.

6000|$|And {{very shortly}} after this, the archbishop, {{who had been}} taking a village walk, entered the room. It was evident that he was {{intimate}} with the occupiers of Hurstley Hall. He addressed Mrs. Thornberry with the ease of habitual acquaintance, while John Hampden seemed almost to rush into his arms. Job himself had seen his Grace in London, though he had never had the opportunity of speaking to him, but yielded to his cordiality, when the archbishop, on his being named, said, [...] "It is <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> an old friend, and in times past a kind one." ...|$|E

The Lieutenant made a statement which rather amazed me. He said that, {{on account of the}} scarcity of business, many American officers were to be found getting practical instruction from little troubles among the South American Republics. When the need broke out they would return. [...] "There is so little for us to do, and the Republic has a trick of making us hedge and ditch for our pay.

The wonder won't last long--another week and something fresh will be talked of, and by next year the whole affair will have died away. People have wonderfully short memories in society. Do you know, I rather take credit to myself as a prophetess, for {{on the evening of}} that dinner party where I last met you and Halliburn together, I told Captain Hampton that I didn't think your match would ever come off. By the bye, what a nice fellow he is. He is wonderfully little changed since I knew him as a boy down in Lincolnshire, before he went into the army. Sometimes boys change so when they become men, that it is quite <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> one who has grown up exactly as you might have expected he would do.

6000|$|Everybody, indeed, {{was in high}} spirits. The fog cleared off, the sun shone, {{the ladies}} chatted and laughed, even Mrs. Milliken was in good humor ("My wife is all intellect," [...] Milliken says, looking at her with admiration), and talked with us freely and gayly. She {{was kind enough to}} say that it was <b>a</b> great <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with <b>a</b> {{literary}} and well-informed person--that one often lived with people that did not comprehend one. She asked if my companion, that tall gentleman--Mr. Serjeant Lankin, was he?--was literary. And when I said that Lankin knew more Greek, and more Latin, and more law, and more history, and more everything, than all the passengers put together, she vouchsafed to look at him with interest, and enter into a conversation with my modest friend the Serjeant. Then it was that her adoring husband said [...] "his Lavinia was all intellect;"--Lady Kicklebury saying that SHE was not a literary woman: that in HER day few acquirements were requisite for the British female; but that she knew THE SPIRIT OF THE AGE, and her DUTY AS A MOTHER, and that [...] "Lavinia and Fanny had had the best masters and the best education which money and constant maternal solicitude could impart." [...] If our matrons are virtuous, as they are, and it is Britain's boast, permit me to say that they certainly know it.|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) and our {{contractors}} {{strive to}} provide our stakeholders a comprehensive {{understanding of the}} consequences of DOE operations past and present. Toward this end a far-reaching multimillion-dollar annual monitoring and surveillance program collects and analyzes tens of thousands of air, surface and groundwater, soil, mud, plant, and animal samples. This effort represents the work of many dedicated environmental scientists who carry out these extensive programs and work hard to protect and enhance the environment. We publish the results in a detailed Annual Site Environmental Report (ASER), and a separate Data Volume for those who wish to see the supporting data. These documents present all the facts and figures, but are highly technical and not easily understood, and it's essential we provide a summary document simple to read and understand. So each year I team with Karns High School and ask students to write an Annual Site Environmental Report Summary that will be both informative and enjoyable to read. These environmental documents are perhaps the most important DOE reports because they explain the environmental monitoring programs and show the consequences of our operations in great detail to our legislatures, stakeholders, and the public. This ASER summary is written for you, the public, our most important stakeholder, with the hope that you find it comprehensible and of value in gaining an accurate understanding of the Oak Ridge Reservation. All three documents {{can be found on the}} web, along with previous publications, at [URL] It's <b>a</b> great <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> my new class each year and capture fresh creative ideas. I'm always delighted to see their interest and desire to learn and to produce a document for the public that reflects their personality and skills, and one the public will utilize and find of value. I sincerely thank these talented Karns High School students and their exceptional teacher, Mrs. Heather Bock, for accepting my challenge to think out of the box and put together this DOE document. Thanks go out as well to each contributing art student, and of course to Principal Clifford Davis, Jr., for his enthusiastic support. When I gave this College Preparation English 4 Class the challenge I was given back all smiles, eagerness, and an ardent zeal to succeed. I hope you, our public, find this product of their effort of value and quality...|$|R

6000|$|Early in January, I {{was invited}} again to lunch with the Le Geyts. Hilda Wade was invited, too. The moment {{we entered the}} house, we were both of us aware that some grim change had come over it. Le Geyt met us in the hall, in his old genial style, it is true; but still with a certain reserve, a curious veiled {{timidity}} which we had not known in him. Big and good-humoured as he was, with kindly eyes beneath the shaggy eyebrows, he seemed strangely subdued now; the boyish buoyancy {{had gone out of}} him. He spoke rather lower than was his natural key, and welcomed us warmly, though less effusively than of old. An irreproachable housemaid, in a spotless cap, ushered us into the transfigured drawing-room. Mrs. Le Geyt, in a pretty cloth dress, neatly tailor-made, rose to meet us, beaming the vapid smile of the perfect hostess--that impartial smile which falls, like the rain from Heaven, on good and bad indifferently. [...] "SO charmed to see you again, Dr. Cumberledge!" [...] she bubbled out, with a cheerful air--she was always cheerful, mechanically cheerful, from a sense of duty. [...] "It IS such <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> dear Hugo's old friends! AND Miss Wade, too; how delightful! You look so well, Miss Wade! Oh, you're both at St. Nathaniel's now, aren't you? So you can come together. What a privilege for you, Dr. Cumberledge, to have such a clever assistant--or, rather, fellow-worker. It must be a great life, yours, Miss Wade; such a sphere of usefulness! If we can only feel we are DOING GOOD--that is the main matter. For my own part, I like to be mixed up with every good work that's going on in my neighbourhood. I'm the soup-kitchen, you know, and I'm visitor at the workhouse; and I'm the Dorcas Society, and the Mutual Improvement Class; and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and to Children, and I'm sure I don't know how much else; so that, what with all that, and what with dear Hugo and the darling children"--she glanced affectionately at Maisie and Ettie, who sat bolt upright, very mute and still, in their best and stiffest frocks, on two stools in the corner--"I can hardly find time for my social duties." ...|$|E
