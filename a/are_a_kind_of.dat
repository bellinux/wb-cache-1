5|$|In {{addition}} to the spore shape, the species is readily identified {{with the use of}} a microscope because of its setae. Setae <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> unusual cystidia unique to the family Hymenochaetaceae, and, in P.ellipsoideus, are found in the hymenium. In shape, the setae are ventricose, with distinctive hooks on their tips. In colour, they are yellow-brown, and they have thick cell walls. They measure 20 to 30 by 10 to 14μm. Neither more standard cystidia nor cystidioles (underdeveloped cystidia) can be found in the species, but there are a number of rhomboid crystals throughout the hymenium and the flesh.|$|E

25|$|The modal {{concepts}} in Persian folk music are directly linked {{with that of}} the classical music. However, improvisation plays a minor role as folk tunes are characterized by relatively clear-cut melodic and rhythmic properties. The function of each folk melody determines its mood. The varying aesthetic requirements of wedding songs, lullabies, love songs, harvest songs, dance pieces, etc., are met with transparent and appropriate simplicity. The majority of the classical instruments are too elaborate and difficult for the folk musicians. Instead, there are literally dozens of musical instruments of various sorts found among the rural people. In fact, each region of the country can boast instruments peculiar to itself. Three types of instruments, however, are common to all parts of the country. They <b>are,</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> shawm called Surnay (or Sorna ~ Zorna), the various types of Ney (flute), and the Dohol, a doubleheader drum.|$|E
25|$|Veracruz cuisine divides {{into six}} regions called Sotavento, Centro Norte, Centro Sur, Sierra, Costa Norte, and Los Tuxtlas. The Sotovento area {{is in the}} south of the state, and the dishes here are heavily based on rice. Common dishes include arroz a la tumbada, which is rice cooked with seafood or meat and rice with fried bananas. Seafood dishes are also {{prominent}} based mostly on fish and shrimp. A common ingredient in dishes is a herb called “hoja santa” or “hierba Santa,” which is a plant of the Piperaceae family. The Centro Norte is centered on Xalapa. Dishes here tend to be more indigenous in nature, heavily flavored with mild chili peppers. Common dishes here include Chilehuates, similar to a tamale, stuffed chile peppers, and enchiladas. Less seafood and more pork and domestic fowl are consumed. The Centro Sur area is mostly indigenous and encompasses the area of, Huatusco, Coscomatepec, Cotaxtla, Orizaba, Amatlán, Huilango y las españolas Córdoba y Fortín de las Flores, la negra Yanga and San Lorenzo de los Negros. Dishes here are similar to Centro Norte, but chayotes appear more often as this region is a major producer of the vegetable. Meats in adobo sauce are common as well. The Sierra and Costa Norte encompass {{the northern part of the}} state, such as the Pánuco River area and Totonacapan. This area is noted for a number of unique dishes such as frijoles en achuchutl, made with black beans, pork rind, chayotes, squash seeds, and jalapeño peppers. Bocoles <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> filled tortilla made with corn dough, stuffed with black beans, chorizo, eggs, or seafood, which then are fried in lard. Tamales are often made with banana leaves. The area is also known for its breads, especially anise–flavored rolls. The Los Tuxtlas area is centered on the communities of Santiago, San Andrés and Catemaco, which were the center of the Olmec civilization. The cuisine in this area features yucca, “chocos” (a type edible flower), fish, especially mojarra, and exotic meats such as monkey, and iguana.|$|E

500|$|The Berlin Vossische Zeitung, wrote: [...] "We have {{to count}} on reverses like that near Arras. Such events <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{tactical}} reverse. If this tactical reverse is not followed by strategical effects i.e., breaking through {{on the part of}} the aggressor, then the whole battle is nothing but a weakening of the attacked party in men and materiel." [...] The same day, the Frankfurter Zeitung commented: [...] "If the British succeed in breaking through it will render conditions worse for them as it will result in freedom of operations which is Germany's own special art of war". General Ludendorff was less sanguine. The news of the battle reached him during his 52nd birthday celebrations at his headquarters in Kreuznach. He wrote: [...] "I had looked forward to the expected offensive with confidence and was now deeply depressed". He telephoned each of his commanders and [...] "gained the impression that the principles laid down by OHL were sound but the whole art of leadership lies in applying them correctly". (A later court of inquiry would establish that Falkenhausen had indeed misunderstood the principles of defence in depth.) Ludendorff immediately ordered reinforcements. Then, on 11 April, he sacked Falkenhausen's chief of staff and replaced him with [...] Loßberg. Loßberg went armed with vollmacht (a power of command [...] enabling him to issue orders in the army ccommander's name), replacing Falkenhausen. Within hours of arriving, Loßberg began to restructure the German defences. The British aimed to consolidate the gains made in the first days of the offensive, to keep the initiative and to break through in concert with the French at Aisne. From 16 April, it was apparent that the French part of the Nivelle Offensive on the Aisne had not achieved a breakthrough. Haig continued to attack at Arras, to continue to divert troops from the French on the Aisne.|$|E

2500|$|Myoclonus is a brief, {{involuntary}} [...] of {{a muscle}} {{or a group}} of muscles. It describes a medical sign and, generally, is not a diagnosis of a disease. These myoclonic twitches, jerks, or seizures are usually caused by sudden muscle contractions (positive myoclonus) or brief lapses of contraction (negative myoclonus). The most common circumstance under which they occur is while falling asleep (hypnic jerk). Myoclonic jerks occur in healthy persons and are experienced occasionally by everyone. However, when they appear with more persistence and become more widespread they can be a sign of various neurological disorders. Hiccups <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> myoclonic jerk specifically affecting the diaphragm. When a spasm is caused by another person it is known as a provoked spasm. Shuddering attacks in babies fall in this category.|$|E
2500|$|W.V.O. Quine {{offers a}} {{practical}} {{solution to this problem}} by making the metaphysical claim that only predicates that identify a [...] "natural kind" [...] (i.e. a real property of real things) can be legitimately used in a scientific hypothesis. R. Bhaskar also offers {{a practical solution}} to the problem. He argues that the problem of induction only arises if we deny the [...] possibility [...] of [...] a [...] reason for the predicate, [...] located [...] in [...] the [...] enduring [...] nature [...] of [...] something. For example, we know that all emeralds are green, not because we have only ever seen green emeralds, but because the chemical make-up of emeralds insists that they must be green. If we were to change that structure, they would not be green. For instance, emeralds <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> green beryl, made green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium.

2500|$|Bonfires {{continued}} to be {{a key part of the}} festival in the modern era. All hearth fires and candles would be doused before the bonfire was lit, generally on a mountain or hill. Ronald Hutton writes that [...] "To increase the potency of the holy flames, in Britain at least they were often kindled by the most primitive of all means, of friction between wood." [...] In the 19th century, for example, John Ramsay described Scottish Highlanders kindling a need-fire or force-fire at Beltane. Such a fire was deemed sacred. In the 19th century, the ritual of driving cattle between two fires—as described in Sanas Cormaic almost 1000 years before—was still practised across most of Ireland and in parts of Scotland. Sometimes the cattle would be driven [...] "around" [...] a bonfire or be made to leap over flames or embers. The people themselves would do likewise. In the Isle of Man, people ensured that the smoke blew over them and their cattle. When the bonfire had died down, people would daub themselves with its ashes and sprinkle it over their crops and livestock. Burning torches from the bonfire would be taken home, where they would be carried around the house or boundary of the farmstead and would be used to re-light the hearth. From these rituals, it is clear that the fire was seen as having protective powers. Similar rituals were part of May Day, Midsummer or Easter customs in other parts of the British Isles and mainland Europe. According to Frazer, the fire rituals <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> imitative or sympathetic magic. According to one theory, they were meant to mimic the Sun and to [...] "ensure a needful supply of sunshine for men, animals, and plants". According to another, they were meant to symbolically [...] "burn up and destroy all harmful influences".|$|E
