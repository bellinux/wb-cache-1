500|$|To avoid bloodshed, Cowboy Frank Patterson promised Hurst {{they would}} return the mules and Hurst persuaded the posse to withdraw. Hurst went to nearby Charleston, but the Cowboys showed up {{two days later}} without the mules, {{laughing}} at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Hurst had printed and distributed a handbill in which he named Frank McLaury as specifically assisting with hiding the mules. He reprinted this in The Tombstone Epitaph on July 30, 1880. Virgil later said that McLaury had {{asked him if he}} had posted the handbills. When Virgil said he had not, McLaury said if Virgil had printed the handbills it was Frank's intention to kill Virgil. He warned Virgil, [...] "If you ever again follow us <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> did, then you will have to fight anyway." [...] This incident was the first run-in between the Clantons and McLaurys and the Earps.|$|E
500|$|Cowboy Frank Patterson [...] "made {{some kind}} of a compromise" [...] with Captain Hurst, who persuaded the posse to withdraw, with the {{understanding}} that the mules would be returned. The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Capt. Hurst printed a handbill describing the theft, and specifically charged Frank McLaury with assisting with hiding the mules. He also reproduced the flyer in The Tombstone Epitaph, on July 30, 1880. Frank McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy-friendly Nuggett, calling Hurst [...] "unmanly", [...] "a coward, a vagabond, a rascal, and a malicious liar", and accused Hurst of stealing the mules himself. Capt. Hurst later cautioned Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan that the Cowboys had threatened their lives. Virgil reported that Frank accosted him and warned him, [...] "If you ever again follow us <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> did, then you will have to fight anyway." [...] A month later, Earp ran into Frank and Tom McLaury in Charleston, and they told him if he ever followed them as he had done before, they would kill him.|$|E

2500|$|Zanac, in retrospect, {{has been}} {{considered}} a unique shoot 'em up game, combining gameplay elements from games such as Xevious, especially with the extensive power-up system and vertical-scrolling gameplay that features both air and ground targets. Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame praised Zanac, calling it an extremely fast-paced shooter in which the player is almost completely surrounded by enemy ships and bullets. He praises the game for its music which seems to flow along with {{the action of the}} game; he calls the music [...] "at least <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can get to a Zen moment while playing a shooting game on the NES". Frank Provo of GameSpot lauded Zanac for its difficulty level, its ability to handle many sprites on the screen without slowdown or other glitches, and its unique AI, which placed this game in a subgenre of its own. However, criticisms include mediocre and primitive music and sound, a steep learning curve in gameplay and difficulty level, and poor translation in the game itself and in the game's instruction manual. In addition, Weiss says that enemies in Zanac, while fearsome, [...] "don't have much personality".|$|E

60|$|I {{say that}} my place was by her side, {{but it was not}} so dashed easy to get there, for she was setting a {{cracking}} pace. At the top of the first flight she must have led by a matter of half a dozen lengths, and was still shaking off my challenge when she rounded into the second.

5000|$|Felice (born 1955) {{grew up in}} Natick, Massachusetts, as a {{neighbor}} and friend of Jonathan Richman, a fellow fan of the Velvet Underground.

60|$|Now for {{the manner}} of the support. You must all know well the look of the machicolated {{parapets}} in mediæval castles. You know they are carried on rows of small projecting buttresses constructed so that, though the uppermost stone, far-projecting, would break easily under any shock, it is supported by the next below, and so on, down to the wall. Now in this figure I am obliged to separate the feathers by white spaces, to show you them distinctly.

60|$|It is true you {{can make}} your net of logical {{interpretation}} finer and finer, you can fine your classification more and more--up to a certain limit. But essentially you are working in limits, and <b>as</b> <b>you</b> come <b>closer,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> look at finer and subtler things, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> leave the practical purpose for which the method exists, the element of error increases. Every species is vague, every term goes cloudy at its edges; and so in my way of thinking, relentless logic is only another name for a stupidity--for a sort of intellectual pigheadedness. If you push a philosophical or metaphysical inquiry through a series of valid syllogisms--never committing any generally recognised fallacy--you nevertheless leave behind you at each step a certain rubbing and marginal loss of objective truth, and you get deflections that are difficult to trace at each phase in the process. Every species waggles about in its definition, every tool is a little loose in its handle, every scale has its individual error. So long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are reasoning for practical purposes about finite things of experience you can every now and then check your process and correct your adjustments. But not when you make what are called philosophical and theological inquiries, when you turn your implement towards the final absolute truth of things.|$|R
6000|$|But the Chimæra {{was so mad}} {{and wild}} with pain, {{that it did not}} guard itself so well as might else have been the case. Perhaps, after all, the best way to fight a Chimæra is by getting <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to it <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can. In its efforts to stick its horrible iron claws into its enemy, the {{creature}} left its own breast quite exposed; and perceiving this, Bellerophon thrust his sword up to the hilt into its cruel heart. Immediately the snaky tail untied its knot. The monster let go its hold of Pegasus, and fell from that vast height, downward; while the fire within its bosom, instead of being put out, burned fiercer than ever, and quickly began to consume the dead carcass. Thus it fell out of the sky, all a-flame, and (it being nightfall before it reached the earth) was mistaken for a shooting star or a comet. But, at early sunrise, some cottagers were going to their day's labor, and saw, to their astonishment, that several acres of ground were strewn with black ashes. In the middle of a field, there was a heap of whitened bones, a great deal higher than a haystack. Nothing else was ever seen of the dreadful Chimæra! ...|$|R
