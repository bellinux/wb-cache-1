40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the long-run {{relation}} and short-run dynamic correlations between consumption expenditure <b>and</b> household <b>wealth,</b> namely housing <b>wealth</b> <b>and</b> stock <b>wealth.</b> Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts aggregate time-series data over the period of 1981 Q 1 - 2010 Q 4 in Hong Kong. It employs the ARDL to cointegration procedure and the multivariate stochastic volatility (MSV) model to investigate the long-run elasticity and dynamic correlations between aggregate consumption expenditure <b>and</b> household <b>wealth</b> indicators. Findings: The results suggest that both housing <b>wealth</b> <b>and</b> stock <b>wealth</b> have significant effects on consumption expenditure after controlling for the aggregate income level. The long-run elasticity of consumption expenditure with respect to housing <b>wealth</b> <b>and</b> stock <b>wealth</b> are 0. 3877 and 0. 1424 respectively, while the marginal propensity to consume for housing <b>wealth</b> <b>and</b> for stock <b>wealth</b> are 0. 2159 and 0. 0266 respectively. The dynamic correlation analysis implies that the decrease in housing <b>and</b> stock <b>wealth</b> may further depress consumer behavior and economic condition during the post-financial crisis period. Originality/value: This paper provides useful information with regard to the long-run and dynamic relations between consumption and different types of wealth components.

5|$|Among the Tlingit of the Pacific Northwest of America, {{earrings}} were {{a sign of}} nobility <b>and</b> <b>wealth,</b> as {{the placement}} of each earring on a child had to be purchased at an expensive potlatch. Earrings were common in the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt (1550–1292 BCE), generally taking {{the form of a}} dangling, gold hoop. Gem-studded, golden earrings shaped like asps seem to have been reserved for nobility. The ancient Greeks wore paste pendant earrings shaped like sacred birds or demigods, while the women of ancient Rome wore precious gemstones in their ears.|$|E

5|$|In a {{situation}} analogous {{with that of}} other European countries, the progressive internal decay of the Polish Church created conditions favorable for the dissemination of the Reformation ideas and currents. For example, there was a chasm between the lower clergy and the nobility-based Church hierarchy, which was quite laicized and preoccupied with temporal issues, such as power <b>and</b> <b>wealth,</b> and often corrupt. The middle nobility, which had already {{been exposed to the}} Hussite reformist persuasion, increasingly looked at the Church's many privileges with envy and hostility.|$|E
5|$|Many {{tensions}} existed {{within the}} system of government. Royal landownings <b>and</b> <b>wealth</b> stretched across England, and placed the king in a privileged position above even {{the most powerful of}} the noble elite. Successive kings, though, still needed more resources to pay for military campaigns, conduct building programmes or to reward their followers, and this meant exercising their feudal rights to interfere in the land-holdings of nobles. This was contentious and a frequent issue of complaint, as there was a growing belief that land should be held by hereditary right, not through the favour of the king. Property <b>and</b> <b>wealth</b> became increasingly focused {{in the hands of a}} subset of the nobility, the great magnates, at the expense of the wider baronage, encouraging the breakdown of some aspects of local feudalism. As time went by, the Norman nobility intermarried with many of the great Anglo-Saxon families, and the links with the Duchy began to weaken. By the late 12th century, mobilising the English barons to fight on the continent was proving difficult, and John's attempts to do so ended in civil war. Civil strife re-emerged under Henry III, with the rebel barons in 1258–59 demanding widespread reforms, and an early version of Parliament was summoned in 1265 to represent the rebel interests.|$|E
