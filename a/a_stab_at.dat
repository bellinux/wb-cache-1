25|$|MGM {{had bought}} the film rights to Clare Boothe Luce's 1936 smash Broadway hit The Women in 1937. Many writers had, unsuccessfully, taken <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>at</b> a {{screenplay}} version. The studio handed it to Loos and veteran scriptwriter Jane Murfin, and three weeks later Loos handed Cukor a script that he loved. Unfortunately the censorship board did not. They insisted on changing more than 80 lines, and the film {{had to go into}} production. Loos was apprehensive, but Cukor insisted she do the changes on set, among his all-star bevy of leading ladies. Loos made immediate friends with Paulette Goddard, who was surprisingly well-read. She also had Aldous and Maria Huxley as houseguests, and encouraged Huxley to stay in California and continue to write there. When World War II began in September 1939, Loos convinced Huxley that it would be safer for his family if they stayed in the United States rather than returning to England, and she got him a job adapting screenplays at MGM.|$|E
25|$|The band's origins can {{be traced}} to 1981, in Bradford, Yorkshire, where vocalist and {{songwriter}} Ian Astbury formed a band called Southern Death Cult. The name was chosen with a double meaning, and was derived from the 14th century Native American religion, the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex or Southern Death Cult as it was sometimes known, from the Mississippi delta area, but it was also <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>at</b> what the band viewed was the centralisation of power in Southern England (including that of the music industry); there has long been a perceived notion of a North-South divide based on social, historic and economic reasons. Astbury was joined by Buzz Burrows (guitar), Barry Jepson (bass) and Aki Nawaz Qureshi (drums); they performed their first show at the Queen's Hall in their hometown of Bradford on 29 October 1981. The band were at the forefront of an emerging style of music, in the form of post-punk and gothic rock (then known as positive-punk), they achieved critical acclaim from the press and music fans.|$|E

500|$|Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed {{awarded the}} episode 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] "this Chris Carter-directed ep [...] oddly enough doesn't {{center on the}} series mythology arc, but instead opts for <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>at</b> the tired ol' virtual reality genre.

An editor from The New York Times said that [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] is grandiose [...] "even by the album's standards". Sputnikmusic said that the song is the best on the album and gave it a grade of 4.5 along with [...] "Good Enough", adding that on the last two songs the album stops to be boring because of the musical variation. On Postmedia News it was stated that Lee [...] "achieves stunning notes on 'Lacrymosa', which employs a haunting choir". Jordan Reimer from The Daily Princetonian praised Lee's melodies and said that [...] "Cloud Nine" [...] and [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] were her best two arrangements. John Hood from the Miami New Times made a story, [...] "'Call Me When You're Sober' sent a man away, 'Lacrymosa' kept him there, and 'Cloud Nine' told the clueless dolt why he would no longer ever be welcomed back.

Nicki Minaj reportedly never confirmed or denied that the song was about Remy, however Remy Ma remarked in a 2010 interview, [...] "To this day I still feel like [...] is <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>at</b> me; I'm gonna [...] back for that one". Since 2011, Remy Ma has stated that she supports Nicki Minaj and her success, [...] but added that she would be [...] "a problem" [...] to Minaj once she is released from prison. On March 3, 2017, during a visit to The Wendy Williams Show, Remy Ma affirmed that her option in releasing a blatant Minaj diss track titled [...] "Shether" [...] was considered after allegations were brought forward to Ma's camp about Minaj [...] "trying to keep [...] off of red carpets, trying to make sure awards don't go to [...] " [...] and [...] "trying to make people make bad reports about Plata O Plomo album sales."

2500|$|Basil usually {{turns to}} Manuel or Polly {{to help him}} with his schemes, while trying his best to keep Sybil from {{discovering}} them. However, Basil occasionally laments for the time when there was passion in their relationship, now seemingly lost. Also, it appears he still does care for her, and actively resists the flirtations of a French guest in one episode. The penultimate episode, [...] "The Anniversary", is about his efforts to put together a surprise anniversary party [...] involving their closest friends. Things go wrong as Basil pretends the anniversary date doesn't remind him of anything though he pretends to have <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>at</b> it by reeling off a list of random anniversaries, starting with the Battle of Agincourt, for which he receives a slap from Sybil, who becomes increasingly frustrated and angry. He continues guessing even after Sybil is out of earshot, and mentions other anniversaries (none of which happened on 17 April), including the Battle of Trafalgar and Yom Kippur, just to enhance the surprise. Sybil believes he really has forgotten, and leaves in a huff. In an interview in the DVD box set, Cleese claims this episode deliberately takes a slightly different tone from the others, fleshing out their otherwise inexplicable status as a couple (as well as saying that, if a third series had been made, there would have been similar episodes).|$|E
