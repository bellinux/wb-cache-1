40|$|The Dolores River in Utah and the Virgin River in Nevada are {{ecosystems}} {{under pressure}} from increased groundwater withdrawal due to growing human populations, climate change and introduced species such as Tamarix spp. (tamarisk). Tamarisk is reputed to take excessive water from its environment. Controlling tamarisk is of concern in the western United States where plants grow quickly in already fragile and diminishing riparian areas. For this reason, biologic control beetles Chrysomelidae: Diorhabda carinulata were released to weaken the tamarisk population, thus reducing its water use. The studies for this dissertation were conducted between 2010 and 2011. We quantified tamarisk water use over multiple cycles of annual defoliation using sap flow measurements, leaf area index (LAI), well data, allometry and satellite imagery from EOS- 1 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensor. Study objectives for the Virgin River were to measure evapotranspiration (ET) before beetles ever arrived and {{to examine the effects}} on tamarisk ET in the year after beetle arrival. This site showed plant ET from sap flow averaged about 4. 3 mm m⁻² leaf day⁻¹ in 2010. In 2011, ET from sap flow averaged 6. 4 mm m⁻² leaf area day⁻¹ pre beetle arrival, but dropped to 3 - 4 mm m⁻² leaf area day⁻¹ after beetle <b>arrival.</b> <b>Stand</b> level ET measured by MODIS was 2. 2 mm d⁻¹ in 2010 and approximately 1. 5 mm day⁻¹ when beetle arrival was measured in 2011. Significant visual change was apparent as the trees senesced. Results showed the first year of beetle arrival resulted in reduced ET but did not result in significant water savings. We also compared the reaction of the newly defoliated (in 2011) Virgin River site to the long-term defoliated (since 2007) Dolores River site to explore if all beetle invasions were created equal. This paper views the two sites as fairly extreme examples of tamarisk stand reaction to the beetle. While no mortality was reported at the Dolores River site, the site is much older, less photosynthetically active and covers far less ground when compared to the younger tamarisk monoculture on the Virgin River. Pre-beetle arrival Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values were higher on the Virgin River than on the Dolores River. Beetle arrival at each site was captured with Landsat NDVI and a reduced NDVI signal (13 % drop in NDVI at Dolores River, 5 % drop at Virgin River) was seen after beetle arrival...|$|E

40|$|A Masters Dissertation, {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the award of Master of Science of Loughborough University. The aim of this thesis is to obtain from a simulation procedure a set of graphs to compute the number of aircraft stands required at an airport. The scope of the study has been set within airports from the size of that of Birmingham up to those of the size of Manchester. A general approach has been taken hoping that the graphs may be used in the case of similar airports within the range. A computer model is developed to compute stand requirements for 5 aircraft groups under 4 aircraft mixes and 5 flight type mixes. The basic input variables taken into account in the model are aircraft <b>arrival</b> time and <b>stand</b> occupancy time. The model simulates the apron under three handling rules, the first one being that of stands mutually shared amongst the aircraft groups, the second without stands sharing and the last case for stands being partially shared. With outputs from the simulation procedure a number of graphs are plotted with arrivals per hour as the independent variable and stands required as the dependent variable. The graphs are split into 4 groups according to the aircraft mixes...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how {{invasive}} species establish and spread {{is vital for}} developing effective management strategies for invaded areas and identifying new areas where the risk of invasion is highest. We investigated the explanatory power of dispersal histories reconstructed based on local-scale wind data and a regionalscale wind-dispersed particle trajectory model for the invasive seed chalcid wasp Megastigmus schimitscheki (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) in France. The explanatory power was tested by: (1) survival analysis of empirical data on M. schimitscheki presence, absence and year of <b>arrival</b> at 52 <b>stands</b> of the wasp’s obligate hosts, Cedrus (true cedar trees); and (2) Approximate Bayesian analysis of M. schimitscheki genetic data using a coalescence model. The Bayesian demographic modeling and traditional population genetic analysis suggested that initial invasion across the range {{was the result of}} long-distance dispersal from the longest established sites. The survival analyses of the windborne expansion patterns derived from a particle dispersal model indicated that there was an informative correlation between the M. schimitscheki presence/absence data from the annual surveys and the scenarios based on regional-scale wind data. These three very different analyses produced highly congruent results supporting our proposal that wind is the most probable vector for passive long-distance dispersal of this invasive seed wasp. This result confirms that long-distance dispersal from introduction areas is a likely driver of secondary expansion of alien {{invasive species}}. Based on our results, management programs for this and other windborne invasive species may consider (1) focusing effort at the longest established sites and (2) monitoring outlying populations remains critically important due to their influence on rates of spread. We also suggest that there is a distinct need for new analysis methods that have the capacity to combine empirical spatiotemporal field data, genetic data, and environmental data to investigate dispersal and invasio...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} Aircraft Routing on Ground {{corresponds}} to the surface movement of aircraft on an airport’s taxiway network, from a runway exit to a parking <b>stand</b> (<b>arrivals)</b> and from a parking stand to a runway entrance (departures). Given such a pair of terminal points and depending on the taxiway network structure, there can be one or more alternative routes that the aircraft can follow to its destination. From a functional perspective, this surface movement is {{the link between the}} airborne movement and the turnaround process for each aircraft. As the size, the operational complexity and the traffic of an airport increases, the sequence of “landing-taxiing-turnaroundtaxiing-taking-off” can become tight and the satisfaction of temporal constraints can become critical in terms of cost-effectiveness, both for the airlines and the airport operators. From the discussion above we can deduce that the choice of an optimal route on the taxiway network for each aircraft depends also on the dimension of time, since the traffic load on each taxiway is a dynamic parameter. The problem that this thesis is concerned with can therefore be called “ 4 D Taxi Routing on Ground”. The work for this thesis was done at Jeppesen GmbH in Neu-Isenburg, Germany. The main focus of this work is the definition, analysis and modeling of the problem of “ 4 D Taxi Routing on Ground”. The entities that constitute the essence of the problem are described: the Taxiway Network as a directed, bimodal graph with weights that are functions of time; the Aircraft as moving agents with a finite set of states; and the Airport Operations as the environment. A set of objectives that determine the quality of a routing solution is also defined: minimization of taxi time, hold time and speed changes for each aircraft. Based on these definitions, a mathematical model is built. In order to test the soundness of the defined model and its applicability to the problem of “ 4 D Taxi Routing on Ground”, an optimization algorithm is designed and implemented, based on a combination of Dijkstra’s SPP algorithm and a Linear Programming formulation. The evaluation of the algorithm is realized using simulations of a 2 -day actual flight schedule and the results support the assumption of correctness for most of the model design choices, while they also show the inefficiencies of a static SPP algorithm when applied to a dynamic or “ 4 D” routing problem, thus indicating directions for further research or potential areas of improvement.

6000|$|Still {{the king}} held back. To change his own faith was {{to change the}} faith of the whole nation, and he thought it well to consult his witan. The old English {{assembly}} was always aristocratic in character, despite its ostensible democracy, for it consisted only of the heads of families; and as the kingdoms grew larger, their aristocratic character necessarily became more pronounced, as only the wealthier persons could be in attendance upon the king. The folk-moot had grown into the witena-gemot, or assembly of wise men. Eadwine assembled such a meeting {{on the banks of the}} Derwent–for moots were always held in the open air at some sacred spot–and there the priests and thegns declared their willingness to accept the new religion. Coifi, chief priest of the heathen gods, himself led the way, and flung a lance in derision at the temple of his own deities. To the surprise of all, the gods did not avenge the insult. Thereupon [...] "King Æduin, with all the nobles and most of the common folk of his nation, received the faith and the font of holy regeneration, in the eleventh year of his reign, which is the year of our Lord's incarnation the six hundred and twenty-seventh, and about the hundred and eightieth after the arrival of the English in Britain. He was baptized at York on Easter-day, the first before the Ides of April (April 12), in the church of St. Peter the Apostle, which he himself had hastily built of wood, while he was being catechised and prepared for Baptism; and in the same city he gave the bishopric to his prelate and sponsor Paulinus. But after his Baptism he took care, by Paulinus's direction, to build a larger and finer church of stone, in the midst whereof his original chapel should be enclosed." [...] To this day, York Minster, the lineal descendant of Eadwine's wooden church, remains dedicated to St. Peter; and the archbishops still sit in the bishop-stool of Paulinus. Part of Eadwine's later stone cathedral was discovered under the existing choir during the repairs rendered necessary by the incendiary Martin. As to the heathen temple, its traces still remained even in Bæda's day. [...] "That place, formerly the abode of idols, is now pointed out not far from York to the westward, beyond the river Dornuentio, and is to-day called Godmundingaham, where the priest himself, through the inspiration of the true God, polluted and destroyed the altars which he himself had consecrated." [...] So close did Bæda live to these early heathen English times.

60|$|To enter Turin then of {{a lovely}} August {{afternoon}} {{was to find}} a city of arcades, of pink and yellow stucco, of innumerable cafes, of blue-legged officers, of ladies draped in the North-Italian mantilla. An old friend of Italy coming back to her finds an easy waking for dormant memories. Every object is a reminder and every reminder a thrill. Half an hour after my <b>arrival,</b> as I <b>stood</b> at my window, which overhung the great square, I found the scene, within and without, a rough epitome of every pleasure and every impression I had formerly gathered from Italy: the balcony and the Venetian-blind, the cool floor of speckled concrete, the lavish delusions of frescoed wall and ceiling, the broad divan framed for the noonday siesta, the massive medieval Castello in mid-piazza, with its shabby rear and its pompous Palladian front, the brick campaniles beyond, the milder, yellower light, the range of colour, the suggestion of sound. Later, beneath the arcades, I found many an old acquaintance: beautiful officers, resplendent, slow-strolling, contemplative of female beauty; civil and peaceful dandies, hardly less gorgeous, with that religious faith in moustache and shirt-front which distinguishes the belle jeunesse of Italy; ladies with heads artfully shawled in Spanish-looking lace, but with too little art--or too much nature at least--in the region of the bodice; well- conditioned young abbati with neatly drawn stockings. These indeed are not objects of first-rate interest, and with such Turin is rather meagrely furnished. It has no architecture, no churches, no monuments, no romantic street-scenery. It has the great votive temple of the Superga, which stands on a high hilltop above the city, gazing across at Monte Rosa and lifting its own fine dome against the sky with no contemptible art. But when you have seen the Superga from the quay beside the Po, a skein of a few yellow threads in August, despite its frequent habit of rising high and running wild, and said to yourself that in architecture position is half the battle, you have nothing left to visit but the Museum of pictures. The Turin Gallery, which is large and well arranged, is the fortunate owner of three or four masterpieces: a couple of magnificent Vandycks and a couple of Paul Veroneses; the latter a Queen of Sheba and a Feast of the House of Levi--the usual splendid combination of brocades, grandees and marble colonnades dividing those skies de turquoise malade to which Théophile Gautier is fond of alluding. The Veroneses are fine, but with Venice in prospect the traveller feels at liberty to keep his best attention in reserve. If, however, he has the proper relish for Vandyck, let him linger long and fondly here; for that admiration will never be more potently stirred than by the adorable group of the three little royal highnesses, sons and the daughter of Charles I. All the purity of childhood is here, and all its soft solidity of structure, rounded tenderly beneath the spangled satin and contrasted charmingly with the pompous rigidity. Clad respectively in crimson, white and blue, these small scions stand up in their ruffs and fardingales in dimpled serenity, squaring their infantine stomachers at the spectator with an innocence, a dignity, a delightful grotesqueness, which make the picture a thing of close truth as well as of fine decorum. You might kiss their hands, but you certainly would think twice before pinching their cheeks--provocative as they are of this tribute of admiration--and would altogether lack presumption to lift them off the ground or the higher level or dais on which they stand so sturdily planted by right of birth. There is something inimitable in the paternal gallantry with which the painter has touched off the young lady. She was a princess, yet she was a baby, and he has contrived, we let ourselves fancy, to interweave an intimation that she was a creature whom, in her teens, the lucklessly smitten--even as he was prematurely--must vainly sigh for. Though the work is a masterpiece of execution its merits under this head may be emulated, at a distance; the lovely modulations of colour in the three contrasted and harmonised little satin petticoats, the solidity of the little heads, in spite of all their prettiness, the happy, unexaggerated squareness and maturity of pose, are, severally, points to study, to imitate, and to reproduce with profit. But the taste of such a consummate thing is its great secret as well as its great merit--a taste which seems one of the lost instincts of mankind. Go and enjoy this supreme expression of Vandyck's fine sense, and admit that never was a politer production.|$|R
