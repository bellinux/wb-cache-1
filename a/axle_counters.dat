5|$|In 2008, the old {{section of}} Nationaltheatret Station was renovated, {{including}} tracks 1 and 2 {{and the two}} original entrances. Upgrades included new lighting, a new public address system, new escalators which have lighting that changes color, a more powerful fire safety system, improved emergency exits and replacement of cables and baldachin. The upgrade made the old section lighter, and visually similar to the new section, as it was previously painted in dark red. Between 2008 and 2012, the Norwegian National Rail Administration performed a major upgrade to the section between Lysaker and Etterstad, including the permanent way past Nationaltheatret. Among the upgrades are <b>axle</b> <b>counters,</b> mounting of an overhead conductor rail, new switches and new tracks.|$|E

5|$|The Campaign for Borders Rail {{claimed in}} February 2016 that only 35½% of {{services}} were arriving on time at Tweedbank, {{which made the}} Borders Railway one of ScotRail's most poorly-performing services. In addition, reliability issues with the Class 158 units and traincrew problems resulted {{in at least one}} train being cancelled on 74 of the 143 days between 31 March 2016 and 20 August 2016. This comprised 14 days of severe disruption due to crew shortages, 18 days as a result of issues with the Class 158s and nine days for signalling failures. Crew shortages came about due to higher than expected levels of sickness as well as the difficulty of replacing staff during a popular period for annual leave. Reliability issues with the Class 158s were encountered during hot weather which caused radiators to overheat, particularly on steep gradients with a heavy load, as coolant systems became stressed. To deal with the problem, ScotRail sought to replace the faulty radiators with superior quality models. Signalling problems were mainly due to water ingress into <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> as well as a faulty telecommunications link coupled with a failure {{on the part of the}} automated fault-finding system to detect the problem locations.|$|E
5000|$|Preparatory reset - Once a preparatory reset {{is applied}} to the system, the <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> {{continues}} to show the section as occupied until one train movement takes place in the section. Logically, if a train has successfully traversed the section, then the section is clear and the <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> is set back to unoccupied.|$|R
50|$|The first US {{patent for}} an <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> was filed on 3 June 1960 by Ernst Hofstetter and Kurt Haas.|$|R
25|$|Another {{alternative}} is the <b>axle</b> <b>counter,</b> which {{can reduce the}} number of track circuits and thus the number of insulated rail joints required.|$|R
25|$|The line {{past the}} station {{received}} automatic train stop and {{centralized traffic control}} on 12 and 14 December 1993, respectively. The station received <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> instead of track circuits in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Høn became unstaffed on 1 January 1971. The line {{past the}} station {{received}} automatic train stop and {{centralized traffic control}} on 12 and 14 December 1993, respectively. The station received <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> instead of track circuits in 2012.|$|E
25|$|When {{insulated}} {{to prevent}} conduction through the ties, steel ties {{may be used}} with track circuit based train detection and track integrity systems. Without insulation, steel ties may only be used on lines without block signaling and level crossings or on lines that use other forms of train detection such as <b>axle</b> <b>counters.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... {{technicians}} in {{the relay}} room at Severn Tunnel Junction had reset the <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> while investigating the earlier fault, thus clearing the signal for the Sprinter.|$|R
50|$|An {{electronic}} treadle uses {{the disruption of}} an electromagnetic field to detect an axle, rather than a depression bar. Hence, it can count individual axles. Electronic count heads are used in <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> circuits that can replace track circuits completely.|$|R
50|$|The {{two main}} methods of {{mounting}} an <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> is firstly drilling through the rail, this {{is seen as}} time consuming and possible damaging to the rail. However this {{eliminates the need for}} leveling which can help reduce maintenance costs.|$|R
25|$|LZB {{consists}} of equipment {{on the line}} {{as well as on}} the trains. A 30–40km segment of track is controlled by a LZB control center. The control center computer receives information about occupied blocks from track circuits or <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> and locked routes from interlockings. It is programmed with the track configuration including the location of points, turnouts, gradients, and curve speed limits. With this, it has sufficient information to calculate how far each train may proceed and at what speed.|$|E
2500|$|The line {{past the}} station {{received}} automatic train stop and {{centralized traffic control}} on 12 and 14 December 1993, respectively. The station received a renovation in 2011,including receiving <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> instead of track circuits in 2012. Akershus County Municipality has looked into the possibility for building additional parking places at the station {{to allow it to}} become a park and ride complex. A survey from 2010 showed that 25 of 40 people parking at the station lived within [...] of the station.|$|E
50|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> {{are used}} in rail yards to detect train cars as they are sorted. <b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> are placed on the track before each switch and on each track that exits the switch. Rail yard {{management}} software uses occupancy data from the <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> to lock in switches and prevent cars from being routed to tracks that are occupied by other cars.|$|E
30|$|Traffic Management Systems (TMS) provide {{movement}} {{authority to the}} trains with a guaranteed increased level of safety and capacity utilization. All signalling systems continuously communicate with the interlocking systems {{in order to get}} the information about track circuits or <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> and route status [39].|$|R

They are linked by LAN or cables to the interlocking system {{from which they}} receive indications of switch positions, signal indications, and track circuit or <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> occupancy. Finally, the route center's computers communicates with controlled trains via the cable loops previously described.|$|R
50|$|Where {{there are}} {{interlocked}} turnouts, an <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> unit {{needs to be}} provided for each leg of that turnout. On lines with non-interlocked/hand operated switches, detection of the switch points would have to be monitored separately, whereas on track circuited lines misaligned points can be set to automatically break the track circuit.|$|R
50|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> are {{particularly}} useful on electrified railways as they eliminate traction bonding and impedance bonds. <b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> require no bonding and less cabling {{in comparison to}} track circuits, and are therefore generally less expensive to install and maintain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> {{are also}} useful in {{instances}} {{where there are}} issues with water on the track. Generally wheel sensors work under water, {{as long as the}} wiring is above the water. <b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> do not suffer problems with railhead contamination, e.g. due to rust, grease or compacted leaf residue. Sometimes a train puts down anti-slip sand to increase the deceleration while using a emergency brake, but the sand contaminates the rail and the track circuit stops working. <b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> are immune to these problems because they do not rely on the contact of wheel with the rail head to provide an electrical circuit.|$|E

50|$|The {{load cells}} {{can also be}} used as a {{rudimentary}} <b>axle</b> <b>counter.</b> Load cells can also take the place of the seismic elements to measure the seismic phase impulses as opposed to using MEMS or piezoelectric type seismic sensors. Load cell assemblies can be bolted, clamped or strain gauges might be glued directly to rail.|$|R

50|$|The {{computers}} are programmed with fixed {{information from the}} route such as speed limits, gradients, and thelocation of block boundaries, switches, and signals. They are linked by LAN or cables to the interlocking system from which they receive indications of switch positions, signal indications, and track circuit or <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> occupancy. Finally, the route center's computers communicates with controlled trains via the cable loops previously described.|$|R
50|$|Track {{circuits}} in {{the tunnel}} had problems because of wetness; in 2015 these were replaced with <b>axle</b> <b>counters.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> {{are used}} {{in places such as}} wet tunnels (such as the Severn Tunnel), where {{ordinary}} track circuits are unreliable. <b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> are also useful on steel structures (such as the Forth Bridge), which may prevent the normal operation of track circuits if insulating the rails from the structure proves impracticable. <b>Axle</b> <b>counters</b> are also useful on long sections where several intermediate track circuits may be saved. A Thales axle counter sensor, for example, can be 10,500 m from the evaluation unit when connected using the ISDN communication only, but with the addition of an Ethernet converter the distance is limited by the transmission system, while the latest ALTPRO axle counter sensor model ZK24 can be up to 49 km from the evaluation unit.|$|E
50|$|TCOCs are {{ineffective}} where {{train detection}} {{is not by}} means of track circuits, such as <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> or treadles.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} reasons why a driver would be {{required}} to pass a signal at danger with authority, such as track circuit or <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> failure. The driver will have been advised by the signaller to pass the signal at danger, proceeding with caution and being prepared to stop short of any obstruction and to obey all other signals. Immediately before moving, the driver will press the [...] "Trainstop Override" [...] button on the TPWS panel to pass the signal without triggering a TPWS brake demand.|$|R
40|$|Railways, {{like a lot}} of {{industries}} are becoming increasingly reliant on programmable technology for safety. The development of railway technology is however largely driven through market forces and, given the complexity and cost of developing and certifying safety-related systems, rail industry suppliers tend to accede to the needs of their bigger customers. Consequently the in-built functionality is targeted to specific customer needs, and as these needs can vary considerably between railways, there is often a need for customisation to suit a particular application. However, railway products are constantly evolving largely because of technology obsolescence, but also to enhance through added functionality, whilst sometimes also removing no longer necessary functionality. This paper provides a case study for one such product, namely an <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> system, which was developed for application on the QR rail network. The first of the systems were brought into service in 1987 and are still in use today. Since then, there have been several evolutions of the product, which progressively saw the removal of functionality and customisation required by QR. The paper describes the application of the <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> product within QR, the initial development, and what is being done to enable the use of the latest version of the product...|$|R

A double wheel <b>counter</b> or digital <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> system, a typical safety critical system that is used in solid state based railway signaling systems, is considered for achieving higher availability under certain failures. The improvement in the software architecture is influenced by the theory of task scheduler of real time operating system...|$|R
5000|$|Level 3: As level 2, but train {{location}} and train integrity supervision no longer rely on trackside {{equipment such as}} track circuits or <b>axle</b> <b>counters.</b>|$|E
50|$|Besides its {{signalling}} solutions, Thales additionally develops electronic interlocking systems, <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> {{that can}} replace track circuits, {{various types of}} point machines, and railway worker protection systems.|$|E
50|$|Unlike track circuits, <b>axle</b> <b>counters</b> do {{not require}} {{insulated}} rail joints to be installed. This avoids breaking the continuity of long welded rails for insulated joints to be inserted.|$|E
50|$|On 2 March 1972 a through {{freight train}} (Dg 6563) ran through Ingolstadt Hbf at about 60 km/h and {{collided}} with a loaded tanker train (Üg 18263). This stood {{at the entrance of}} the station and had no rear lighting. Due to an <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> fault on the signalling block, the dispatcher had to manually intervene and mistakenly directed the through freight train on to the track occupied by Üg 18263. As a result of the collision, the 20 wagons of the tanker train exploded in fire. The drivers of the colliding train and two residents of a nearby signalman’s house were killed. The dispatcher who had caused the accident committed suicide a few hours after the accident. Due to the complicated salvage, the adjacent neighbourhood had to be evacuated.|$|R
50|$|An <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> is {{a device}} on a railway that detects {{the passing of}} a train between two points on a track. A {{counting}} head (or 'detection point') is installed {{at each end of}} the section, and as each train axle passes the counting head at the start of the section, a counter increments. A detection point comprises two independent sensors, therefore the device can detect the direction and speed of a train by the order and time in which the sensors are passed. As the train passes a similar counting head at the end of the section, the counter compares count at the end of the section with that recorded at the beginning. If the two counts are the same, the section is presumed to be clear for a second train.|$|R
30|$|Railway Interlocking (IXL) Systems are {{a kind of}} TCIS used in railway {{stations}} to control the safety of train movements [67], defined as “an arrangement of signals and their appliances connected to follow each other according to the correct sequence” [150]. IXL includes train lines, separated on track segments, where each segment is connected to track circuits or <b>axle</b> <b>counter</b> [104] that detect, whether a particular segment is occupied by a train [18]. Switching points, as a special type of track segments, then allow the passage of the train from one train line to another [89], while positions of switches [88] control the connection of track segments [90]. Further, signals, placed between track segments, control permission of train movement from one track segment to another through displaying of different colours (red, yellow, green) that inform the train driver {{about the state of the}} following track segments [150]. The route represents a series of related track segments [65], most often through a set of switching points [141], with the possible existence of level crossings [13].|$|R
