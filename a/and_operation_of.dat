Florida State University faculty members collaborated in the design, construction <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the LHC, with some components assembled at Florida State and shipped to CERN for installation.

5|$|At age 23, {{she was the}} {{youngest}} and only female {{member of the team}} which built and experimented with the world's first nuclear reactor (then called a pile), Chicago Pile-1, in a project led by her mentor Enrico Fermi. In particular, Woods was instrumental in the construction and then utilization of geiger counters for analysis during experimentation. She was the only woman present when the reactor went critical. She worked with Fermi on the Manhattan Project, and, together with her first husband John Marshall, she subsequently helped solve the problem of xenon poisoning at the Hanford plutonium production site, and supervised the construction <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> Hanford's plutonium production reactors.|$|E
5|$|Bills {{for three}} {{similarly}} inspired new underground railways were also submitted to Parliament for the 1892 parliamentary session, and, {{to ensure a}} consistent approach, a Joint Select Committee was established to review the proposals. The committee took evidence on various matters regarding the construction <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> deep-tube railways, and made recommendations on the diameter of tube tunnels, method of traction, and the granting of wayleaves. After rejecting the construction of stations on land owned by the Crown Estate and the Duke of Portland between Oxford Circus and Baker Street, the Committee allowed the BS bill to proceed for normal parliamentary consideration.|$|E

In Monitors turret, Greene and Stodder supervised loading and firing of the two 11-inch Dahlgrens. Each gun was crewed by eight men. Thus, during battle, at least 18 men were present in the turret. In Worden's report of 27 January 1862 to Welles, he stated he believed 17 men and 2 officers would be the maximum number in the turret that allowed the crew to work without getting in each other's way.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the {{government}} decided {{to select a}} site for permanent repository by 2010. With four nuclear reactors providing 29% of its electricity, Finland in 1987 enacted a Nuclear Energy Act making the producers of radioactive waste responsible for its disposal, subject to requirements of its Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed repository would be located. Producers of nuclear waste organized the company Posiva, with responsibility for site selection, construction <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> a permanent repository. A 1994 amendment to the Act required final disposal of spent fuel in Finland, prohibiting the import or export of radioactive waste.|$|E
