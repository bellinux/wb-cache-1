Karl Marx believed that a new society is created through <b>a</b> social <b>revolution.</b> On the contrary, J.

Marx said that contradiction between the powers of production will provoke <b>a</b> social <b>revolution.</b> <b>As</b> for Krishnamurti, <b>a</b> social <b>revolution</b> without altering the soul will not alter human suffering.

5|$|Anticholinergics {{and surgery}} (lesioning of the corticospinal pathway {{or some of}} the basal ganglia structures) were the only {{treatments}} until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically. Levodopa was first synthesized in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it received little attention until the mid 20th century.

5|$|In {{the first}} week of August 1914, the German Foreign Office and members of the {{military}} suggested attempting to use the pan-Islamic movement to destabilise the British Empire and begin an Indian revolution.

50|$|<b>A</b> {{communist}} <b>revolution</b> is <b>a</b> proletarian <b>revolution</b> often, but {{not necessarily}} inspired by the ideas of Marxism that aims to replace capitalism with communism, typically with socialism as an intermediate stage. The idea that <b>a</b> proletarian <b>revolution</b> is needed is a cornerstone of Marxism; Marxists believe that the workers of the world must unite and free themselves from capitalist oppression to create a world run by and for the working class. Thus, in the Marxist view, proletarian revolutions need to happen in countries all over the world.|$|R

5|$|A larger demonstration, the 8N, {{took place}} two months later. It was {{attended}} by {{nearly half a million}} people.

Journalist Jorge Lanata explained the polarization was because the government and its supporters thought they were engaged in <b>a</b> <b>revolution,</b> and this justified being against freedom of the press and other public rights. Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said the demonstrators belonged to a class that was against social justice, and compared the demonstrations to a coup d'état.
