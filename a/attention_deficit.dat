40|$|<b>Attention</b> <b>deficits,</b> {{among other}} {{cognitive}} deficits, are frequently observed in schizophrenia. Although {{valid and reliable}} neurocognitive tasks have been established to assess <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> in schizophrenia, the hierarchical value of those tests as diagnostic discriminants on a single-subject level remains unclear. Thus, much research is devoted to <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> that {{are unlikely to be}} translated into clinical practice. On the other hand, a clear hierarchy of <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> in schizophrenia could considerably aid diagnostic decisions and may prove beneficial for longitudinal monitoring of therapeutic advances. To propose a diagnostic hierarchy of <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> in schizophrenia, we investigated several facets of attention in 86 schizophrenia patients and 86 healthy controls using a set of established attention tests. We applied state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to determine attentive test variables that enable an automated differentiation between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. After feature preranking, hypothesis building, and hypothesis validation, the polynomial support vector machine classifier achieved a classification accuracy of 90. 70 % +/- 2. 9 % using psychomotor speed and 3 different attention parameters derived from sustained and divided attention tasks. Our study proposes, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first hierarchy of <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> in schizophrenia by identifying the most discriminative attention parameters among a variety of <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> found in schizophrenia patients. Our results offer a starting point for hierarchy building of schizophrenia-associated <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> and contribute to translating these concepts into diagnostic and therapeutic practice on a single-subject level...|$|R

By having the participants verbally repeat the instruction previously given by the experimenter, engage in the behavior, and receive reinforcement, we believe that correspondence training can help individuals pay attention.

40|$|Background: Information {{about the}} <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> {{of people with}} stroke living in the {{community}} is limited. The aims of this study were, to describe levels of attention and to explore the relationships between <b>attention</b> <b>deficits,</b> functional ability and fall events. Method: Subjects living in the community were identified through GPs and therapy records. Assessments of balance, ADL function, attention and history of falls were completed in participants' homes for this cross-sectional study. Results: Forty-eight participants (30 men, 18 women mean age 68. 4, SD 11. 2) were recruited, 17 were repeat fallers, 7 single fallers, 12 were nonfallers with near falls and 12 were nonfallers with no near falls. One subject had a brainstem lesion, 26 had right and 21 left hemisphere infarctions. Mean time since onset of stroke was 46 months (range 5 - 204). Five (10. 4 %) participants presented with visual inattention, 15 (31 %) had sustained <b>attention</b> <b>deficits,</b> 9 (19 %) had auditory selective <b>attention</b> <b>deficits,</b> 17 (35 %) had visual selective <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> and 21 (43 %) presented with divided <b>attention</b> <b>deficits.</b> Sustained and divided attention scores were found to correlate with the scores for balance and ADL ability (p < 0. 01). The balance and functional abilities of those subjects with normal attention scores were significantly better than those with abnormal scores (p < 0. 01). Analysis of variance revealed {{significant differences between the}} fall groups for balance, ADL ability and divided attention; the greatest differences (p < 0. 01) were between repeat fallers and nonfallers with no near falls. Conclusions: <b>Attention</b> <b>deficits</b> were common among community-dwelling people with stroke. Repeat fallers had significantly more problems dividing attention than nonfallers with no near falls. Those with impaired attention and those who had fallen repeatedly had significantly greater functional deficits...|$|R

40|$|This study {{looked at}} facilitation, or improvement, of {{behavioral}} responses, such as quicker reaction times and improved accuracy in participants with subclinical <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> and a control group. Studies {{have looked at}} auditory and somatosensory (i. e., touch) stimuli and found that when presented simultaneously there were both neuronal benefits (Simon‐Dack & Teder‐Salejarvi, 2008) and behavioral benefits (Sperdin, Cappe,Foxe & Murray, 2009). The ability {{to attend to the}} stimulus is necessary for multisensory facilitation and when attention is not paid to both sensory inputs multisensory facilitation may not occur (Talsma & Woldorff, 2007). This study used a sustained-attention target task to compare how people with subclinical <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> and controls performing a multisensory integration task. Both populations performed faster in the multisensory condition than in the unisensory condition, but controls also saw an increase twice that of the increase for participants with subclinical <b>attention</b> <b>deficits.</b> This suggests a trend towards true behavioral facilitation in controls that would support the neuronal benefits found by past studies (Simon-Dack and Teder-Salejarvi, 2008). On the other hand, not seeing this trend in participants with subclinical <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> would suggest that even small <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> can interfere with multisensory facilitation.

5|$|<b>Attention</b> <b>deficit</b> {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It {{is characterized by}} problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age. The symptoms appear before a person is twelve years old, are present {{for more than six}} months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance. Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting.|$|E
5|$|Dyslexia is {{believed}} to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people with <b>attention</b> <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood {{as the result of a}} traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.|$|E

40|$|Strokes often cause {{multiple}} behavioural deficits {{that are}} correlated at the population level. Here, {{we show that}} motor and <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> are selectively associated with abnormal patterns of resting state functional connectivity in the dorsal attention and motor networks. We measured <b>attention</b> and motor <b>deficits</b> in 44 right hemisphere-damaged patients with a first-time stroke at 1 - 2 weeks post-onset. The motor battery included tests that evaluated deficits in both upper and lower extremities. The attention battery assessed both spatial and non-spatial <b>attention</b> <b>deficits.</b> Summary measures for motor and <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> were identified through principal component analyses on the raw behavioural scores. Functional connectivity in structurally normal cortex was estimated based on the temporal correlation of blood oxygenation level-dependent signals measured at rest with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Any correlation between motor and <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> and between functional connectivity in the dorsal attention network and motor networks that might spuriously affect the relationship between each deficit and functional connectivity was statistically removed. We report a double dissociation between abnormal functional connectivity patterns and <b>attention</b> and motor <b>deficits,</b> respectively. <b>Attention</b> <b>deficits</b> were significantly more correlated with abnormal interhemispheric functional connectivity within the dorsal attention network than motor networks, while motor deficits were significantly more correlated with abnormal interhemispheric functional connectivity patterns within the motor networks than dorsal attention network. These findings indicate that functional connectivity patterns in structurally normal cortex following a stroke link abnormal physiology in brain networks to the corresponding behavioural deficits...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{levels of}} <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> {{among people with}} stroke living {{in the community and}} explore relationships between attention, balance, function and falls. METHOD: Forty-eight mobile community-dwelling people with stroke (30 men, 18 women, mean age 68. 4 +/- 11. 2) were recruited to this cross-sectional investigation through General Practitioners. Twenty-six participants had a right, 21 a left hemisphere infarction and one had a brain stem lesion mean time since stroke was 46 months (range five to 204). Participants' were interviewed about fall-events; attention, balance and function were assessed using standardised tests. RESULTS: Visual inattention was identified in five participants (10 %), <b>deficits</b> of sustained <b>attention</b> in 15 (31 %), auditory selective attention in nine (19 %), visual selective attention in 17 (35 %) and divided <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> in 21 participants (43 %). Sustained and divided attention scores correlated with balance, ADL ability and fall-status (p < 0. 01). The balance and function of subjects with normal attention were better than those with abnormal scores (p < 0. 01). Analysis of variance revealed differences between repeat-fallers and non-fallers with no near-falls for divided attention, balance and ADL ability (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Attention</b> <b>deficits</b> were common among this sample; sustained and divided <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> correlated with functional impairments and falls, highlighting that <b>attention</b> <b>deficits</b> might contribute to accident prone behaviour and falling...|$|R
5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, <b>attention</b> <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior {{are associated with}} difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification {{were less likely to}} drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric {{disorders such as}} <b>attention</b> <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity disorder and anti-social behaviour. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and violent crime in adulthood. Countries with the highest air lead levels have also {{been found to have}} the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. Lead {{exposure in}} childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the prefrontal cortex correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, angular prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal cortex. Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in <b>attention</b> <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe.|$|E
