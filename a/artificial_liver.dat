The use of artificial cells for hepatocyte transplantation has demonstrated feasibility and efficacy in providing liver function in models of animal liver disease and bioartificial liver devices. Research stemmed off experiments in which the hepatocytes were attached {{to the surface of}} a micro-carriers and has evolved into hepatocytes which are encapsulated in a three-dimensional matrix in alginate microdroplets covered by an outer skin of polylysine. A key advantage to this delivery method is the circumvention of immunosuppression therapy {{for the duration of the}} treatment. Hepatocyte encapsulations have been proposed for use in a bioartifical liver. The device consists of a cylindrical chamber imbedded with isolated hepatocytes through which patient plasma is circulated extra-corporeally in a type of hemoperfusion. Because microcapsules have a high surface area to volume ratio, they provide large surface for substrate diffusion and can accommodate a large number of hepatocytes. Treatment to induced liver failure mice showed a significant increase in the rate of survival. <b>Artificial</b> <b>liver</b> systems are still in early development but show potential for patients waiting for organ transplant or while a patient's own liver regenerates sufficiently to resume normal function. So far, clinical trials using <b>artificial</b> <b>liver</b> systems and hepatocyte transplantation in end-stage liver diseases have shown improvement of health markers but have not yet improved survival. The short longevity and aggregation of artificial hepatocytes after transplantation are the main obstacles encountered.Hepatocytes co-encapsulated with stem cells show greater viability in culture and after implantation and implantation of artificial stem cells alone have also shown liver regeneration.

MARS banks on the recycling of albumin solution via an anion exchanger and active charcoal. The patient's blood is led through the hollow fibre capillaries of a high-flux dialysis filter. Albumin solution, which is circulated in the extracorporeal circuit, passes the membrane counter directionally, allowing albumin-bound toxins in the blood to cross the membrane and bind to the albumin of the MARS circuit. The membrane is, however, impermeable to albumin. When passing the adsorber and filter cartridges, the toxins are cleared by the filter and albumin is regenerated and able to accept new toxins when passing the membrane again. Additionally, the albumin circuit itself is dialysed in the method of continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) or continuous veno-venous heamodiafiltration (CVVHDF), diminishing the load of water-soluble toxins.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} efficacy of <b>artificial</b> extracorporeal <b>liver</b> support therapy {{in the treatment}} of pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) and to analyze the associated prognostic factors. Methods The clinical records of 23 patients with PALF treated from January 2012 to February 2015 in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of the First Hospital of Jilin University were analyzed retrospectively. After three-month follow-up, 15 patients survived (survival group, n= 15), while 8 patients died (death group, n= 8). The changes in biomarkers of liver function and coagulation function after treatment were evaluated within groups. At the same time, the above parameters and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score before treatment were compared between the two groups. The efficacy of <b>artificial</b> extracorporeal <b>liver</b> support therapy was analyzed, and the prognostic factors were reviewed. The t test was applied in the comparison of continuous data. Results In the survival group, the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TBil), ammonia, and lactic acid were significantly reduced after treatment (t= 8. 812, 6. 243, 8. 431, and 6. 721, respectively; all P< 0. 01). However, in the death group, only ALT level was significantly reduced after treatment (t= 2. 532, P< 0. 05). Compared with the levels before treatment, the levels of prothrombin time (PT), prothrombin time activity (PTA), and international normalized ratio (INR) were significantly improved after treatment (t= 6. 256, - 2. 738, and 6. 711, respectively; all P< 0. 05). Before treatment, compared with the survival group, patients in the death group presented significantly lower level of ALT (t= 6. 283 ，P< 0. 01), significantly higher level of TBil (t=- 3. 938, P= 0. 001), significantly longer PT (t=- 2. 394, P= 0. 026), and significantly higher MELD score (t=- 6. 239, P< 0. 01). Conclusion <b>Artificial</b> extracorporeal <b>liver</b> support therapy is an effective way of treating PALF. Once patients with high ALT level, short PT, and high MELD score have been diagnosed with PALF, <b>artificial</b> extracorporeal <b>liver</b> support therapy should be applied as soon as possible to improve the survival rate.

50|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>liver</b> {{support systems}} are aimed to {{temporally}} replace native liver detoxification functions {{and they use}} albumin as scavenger molecule to clear the toxins involved in the physiopathology of the failing liver. Most of the toxins that accumulate in the plasma of patients with liver insufficiency are protein bound, and therefore conventional renal dialysis techniques, such as hemofiltration, hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration {{are not able to}} adequately eliminate them.Between the different albumin dialysis modalities, single pass albumin dialysis (SPAD) has shown some positive results at a very high cost; it has been proposed that lowering the concentration of albumin in the dialysate does not seem to affect the detoxification capability of the procedure. Nevertheless, the most widely used systems today are based on hemodialysis and adsorption. These systems use conventional dialysis methods with an albumin containing dialysate that is latter regenerate by means of adsorption columns, filled with activated charcoal and ion exchange resins. At present, there are two artificial extracorporeal liver support systems: the Molecular Adsorbents Recirculating System (MARS)10 from Gambro and Fractionated Plasma Separation and Adsorption (FPSA), commercialised as Prometheus (PROM) from Fresenius Medical Care.13 Of the two therapies, MARS is the most frequently studied, and clinically used system to date.|$|E
50|$|Admission to the specialty, {{like many}} other {{surgical}} specialties, is very competitive. There {{is a shortage of}} organs and tissues available, and more donors and more surgeons and more locations capable of these procedures are needed, in both developed and developing countries. Because these patients are often somewhat unstable, on some form of life support and/or life-sustaining technologies (cardiopulmonary bypass, respirator/ventilator or breathing tube, implantable cardioverter/defibrillator, some form of dialysis or other renal replacement therapy, <b>artificial</b> <b>liver,</b> parenteral nutrition, etc.), these procedures- especially if they involve the vital organs (heart, lung, liver, pancreas; kidney transplantation could be included here but is more common)- usually only take place in Level I trauma centers that usually are academic medical centers (teaching hospitals), or at least at a relatively large, well-staffed hospital with a 24-hour operating and emergency room service, 24-hour intensive and critical care available, a good hospital pharmacy, 24-hour advanced skilled nursing care available, access to the person's GP and specialist, and 24-hour easy access to anesthesia practitioners, surgeons and physicians, and nurses with expertise in the transplanted organ and in emergency, operative, and intensive care. At smaller (Level II or III) institutions in smaller cities, it is still often possible to perform renal and corneal transplantation (especially on adults), and do skin grafts; the extent of their services varies with the personnel and the organ at stake (hearts, livers, and lungs have extensive arterial, venous, and capillary vasculature, extensive connections to muscle, fascia, and connective tissue, connections to ligaments, tendons, and other body parts, and numerous small parts and nerves and nerve junctions, require a number of anastomoses, or joining of tissues, and are near other important structures). Training in the U.S. usually involves the four years of the undergraduate pre-medical track, four years of medical school, a rotating first year of residency (the former internship year), and then four more residency years (for a total of 5) in general surgery. At some point during those four years, a transplant surgeon would likely train to some extent in emergency surgical procedures, vascular surgical procedures, surgical procedures involving pediatric and/or geriatric cases, and a variety of surgical cases, featuring different conditions, degrees of urgency, and age groups, that require critical and/or intensive care. During their first residency rotational year, they are likely to focus on the surgical field, the emergency room, and critical/intensive care and post-operative/recovery care, as well as some time with immunology, anesthesia, pediatrics, and rehabilitation, and {{to spend some time with}} a paramedic or flight crew. During their residency, they will likely be exposed to a progressively increasing number of transplant cases, with more and more degrees of difficulty, and with less oversight over time. They can also complete another residency afterward in the specialty of the organ systems they most prefer to transplant (cardiovascular, pulmonology, gastrointestinal/hepatic, nephrology/urology, etc.). Fellowships can be done in general transplant medicine or in certain areas of transplant medicine and surgery. Among the possible specialties are: transplantation rejection medicine/immunology, pediatric and/or neonatal transplantation of certain organs, sense organ transplantation (primarily, corneas and research into future advances), transplantation research (i.e., into neural or brain region transplantation), obstetric transplantation (of pregnant women), geriatric transplantation, trauma/burn transplantation surgery, emergency or critical care transplant surgery (for unstable cases: emergency, septic, or acute degeneration cases needing transplants), post-transplantation rehabilitation, and oncologic or diabetic transplantation cases. It is a very stressful position demanding high accuracy in a very unforgiving surgical environment, requiring a very steady physical and motor presence and a calm, professional, and composed personality with a reasonably good bedside manner and the capacity for teamwork involving various personalities and multiple guidelines from multiple institutions, with not-uncommon failure and complication rates and with frequent transfers of patient care between facilities.|$|E

40|$|The Plcsmodium liver {{stage is}} an {{attractive}} target {{for the development of}} antimalarial drugs and vaccines, as it provides an opportunity to interrupt the life cycle of the parasite at a critical early stage. However, targeting the liver stage has been difficult {{due to a lack of}} human liver models that robustly recapitulate host-pathogen interactions in a physiologically relevant cell type. Through the application of hepatic tissue engineering concepts and techniques, this thesis sought to develop advanced models of liver-stage malaria that will allow the facile interrogation of potential antimalarial drugs in primary human hepatocytes. In the first part of this work, we established liver-stage Plasmodium infection in an engineered microscale human liver platform based on micropatterned cocultures of primary human hepatocytes and supportive stromal cells, enabling medium-throughput phenotypic screens for potential antimalarial drugs in a more authentic host cell, and demonstrated the utility of this model for malaria vaccine testing. We further hypothesized and showed that recapitulation of a more physiologically relevant oxygen tension that is experienced by hepatocytes in vivo improved infection rates and parasite growth in vitro. Next, we demonstrated the feasibility of establishing liver-stage malaria infections in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells (iHLCs), thus enabling the study of host genetic variation on liver-stage malaria infection and antimalarial drug responses. We also applied recently discovered small molecules to induce further hepatic maturation, thus increasing the utility of using iHLCs for antimalarial drug development. Finally, we designed and provided a proof-of-concept for a humanized mouse model of liver-stage malaria that involves the fabrication and ectopic implantation of PEG-cryogel-based engineered human <b>artificial</b> <b>livers,</b> and can be generated in a facile, rapid and scalable fashion for future preclinical antimalarial drug testing in vivo.

We introduced a new <b>artificial</b> <b>liver</b> support system, on-line hemodiafiltration, in patients with acute liver failure. Methods This case series study was conducted from May 2001 to October 2008 at the medical intensive care unit of a tertiary care academic medical center. Seventeen consecutive patients who admitted to our hospital presenting with acute liver failure were treated with <b>artificial</b> <b>liver</b> support including daily on-line hemodiafiltration and plasma exchange. Results After 4. 9 ± 0. 7 (mean ± SD) on-line hemodiafiltration sessions, 16 of 17 (94. 1 %) patients completely recovered from hepatic encephalopathy and maintained consciousness for 16. 4 ± 3. 4 (7 - 55) days until discontinuation of <b>artificial</b> <b>liver</b> support (a total of 14. 4 ± 2. 6 [6 - 47] on-line hemodiafiltration sessions).

30|$|Severe liver {{failure is}} {{associated}} with high mortality, as many patients die despite undergoing optimal medical treatment. Even if liver transplantation has emerged as an essential therapy, many patients with this disease will unfortunately die while waiting for a hepatic transplant. Consequently, {{there is a clear}} need for a liver support system to provide a “bridge” to a final treatment. Over the last two decades, several <b>artificial</b> <b>liver</b> support systems with promised advances were introduced. However, whether such improvements could be translated into survival benefit is still uncertain, given the scarcity of available results of RCTs. The present reality is probably related to several factors, including the involvement of several interconnected organs and the fact that liver failure patients constitute a heterogeneous population with severe multimorbidity [94]. Moreover, there is no precise recommendation on the effective timing of the initiation of <b>artificial</b> <b>liver</b> support systems. In this regard, the future prospects of <b>artificial</b> <b>liver</b> support systems should rely on the completion of adequately powered RCTs addressing these crucial clinical issues and endpoints.

According to the properties of ALSS, ALSS is classified into non-bioartificial liver support system (NBALSS), bioartificial liver support system (BALSS) and hybrid <b>artificial</b> <b>liver</b> support system (HALSS). This paper aimed to review the functions, clinical application status, existing problems, and development of ALSS...|$|E
40|$|Besides {{orthotopic}} liver transplantation (OLT) {{there is}} no long-term and effective replacement therapy for severe <b>liver</b> failure. <b>Artificial</b> extracorporeal <b>liver</b> supply devices are able to reduce blood toxin levels, but do not replace any synthetic function of the liver. Molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) {{is one of the}} methods {{that can be used to}} treat fulminant acute liver failure (ALF) or acute on chronic liver failure (AoCLF). The primary non-function (PNF) of the newly transplanted liver manifests in the clinical settings exactly like acute liver failure. MARS treatment can reduce the severity of complications by eliminating blood toxins, so that it can help hepatic encephalopathy (HE), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and the high rate mortality of cerebral herniation. This might serve as a bridging therapy before orthotopic liver retransplantation (reOLT). Three patients after a first liver transplantation became candidate for urgent MARS treatment as a bridging solution prior to reOLT in our center. Authors report these three cases, focusing on indications, MARS sessions, clinical courses, and final outcomes. © 2013 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest...|$|R
40|$|Bioartificial Liver (BAL) is a {{term for}} medical devices {{designed}} to replace natural liver functions. The idea behind the use of <b>artificial</b> <b>livers</b> is to either externally support an injured liver to recovery or bridge a patient with a failing liver to transplantation. Central to all BAL systems is a bioreactor for culturing liver cells. The main function of this reactor {{is to provide a}} cell adhesion matrix and supply the necessary nutrient solution. A high cellular oxygen uptake rate combined with low solubility in aqueous media makes oxygen supply to the liver cells the most constraining factor in current reactor designs. Devices with parallel-plate channel geometry promise high efficiency for blood detoxification and liver metabolism. However, due to their specific flow regime oxygen depletion in the medium is a major problem in these devices. This thesis explores a unique method of controlling and measuring dissolved oxygen in BAL cell-culture bioreactors and lab-on-a-chip devices. Testing is performed using simulations, prototype bioreactor devices and in-vitro measurement of dissolved oxygen. Several strategies developed to fabricate the bioreactors and integrate oxygen sensing are presented. Emphasis is placed on techniques that provide compatibility with commonly used microfabrication processes, while allowing for laterally-resolved measurement of oxygen in a re-usable, low-cost setup. The most significant contribution presented is the development and assessment of the tapered cell-culture bioreactor with integrated PtOEPK/PS oxygen sensor. The combination adopts a unique approach to oxygen control. Bioreactor shape is used to modulate the oxygen supplied to cells via the resulting shear-stress function. By linearly increasing the shear-stress oxygen concentration can be maintained constant over the length of the reactor. Using the integrated oxygen sensor, the resulting concentration profile can be monitored in real-time with high lateral resolution. The advantage of the device over existing techniques is that no additional oxygenation inside the reactor chamber is required to maintain a certain concentration profile and that oxygen concentration can be mapped in-situ without having to introduce further chemicals into the perfusion medium. This thesis presents a number of other contributions: a grayscale mask process, development of the PtOEPK/PS sensor patterning method and signal optimization regime, demonstration of the multi-stream flow application, an experimental setup for sensor calibration and a process to pattern cell-adhesion proteins simultaneously with the oxygen sensor, a multi-layer BAL prototype and the results of a brief experiment to test an approach using vertically aligned carbon nanotube bundles as fluidic conduits for bile drainage...|$|R
40|$|Four out of 16 new allylic pyrophosphates {{synthesized}} {{were found}} to be <b>artificial</b> substrates for <b>liver</b> prenyltransferase (EC 2. 5. 1. 1). These were the trans-and the cis- 3 -ethyl- 3 -methylallyl, the 3, 3 -diethylallyl and the (mixture of cis and trans) 3 -methyl- 3 -n-propylallyl pyrophosphates. The products synthesized from these substrates and isopentenyl pyrophosphate were the appropriate homo- and bishomo-farnesyl pyrophosphates. Substitution of 3, 3 -dimethylallyl pyrophosphate at C- 2 with a methyl group destroyed its reactivity with the enzyme. Neither the unsubstituted allyl pyrophosphate nor the cis- or trans- 3 -methylallyl pyrophosphate could be condensed with isopentenyl pyrophosphate. Thus the simplest allylic substrate for prenyltransferase is 3, 3 -dimethylallyl pyrophosphate...|$|R
