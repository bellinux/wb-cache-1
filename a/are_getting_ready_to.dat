6000|$|... 'Let {{him look}} to that,' cried Bradley. 'Let him look to that! It will {{be bad for}} him when men he has injured, and at whom he has jeered, are {{thinking}} of getting hanged. Let HIM get ready for HIS fate, when that comes about. There was more meaning in what he said than he knew of, or he wouldn't have had brains enough to say it. Let him look to it; let him look to it!

6000|$|So all his life, {{the word}} 'Zagazig' carried {{memories}} of a brick shed, the flicker of an oil-lamp's floating wick, a sky full of eyes, and an engine coughing in a desert at the world's end; which memories returned in a restaurant-car jolting through {{what seemed to be}} miles of brilliantly lighted streets and factories. No one at the table had even turned his head for the battlefields of Kassassin and Tel-el-Kebir. After all, why should they?

But at last it has--very nearly. I have thought {{a great deal about the}} Tyrol. It was a lovely time--the loveliest time I have ever had. And now it's over, I try to console myself by {{thinking}} of the future, but not the immediate future--THAT is not very enjoyable. I wonder how the mountains are looking to-day. Please give my love to them, especially the lion ones that come and lie out in the moonlight--you will not recognize them from this"--then followed a sketch. [...] "And this is the church we went to, with someone kneeling. And this is meant for the 'English Grundys,' looking at someone who is coming in very late with an alpenstock--only, I am better at the 'English Grundys' than at the person with the alpenstock. I wish I were the 'English Grundys' now, still in the Tyrol. I hope I shall get a letter from you soon; and that it will say you <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> come back. My guardian will be awfully keen for you to come and stay with us. He is not half bad when you know him, and there will be his sister, Mrs. Doone, and her daughter left there after the wedding. It will be simply disgusting if you and Mr. Stormer don't come. I wish I could write all I feel about my lovely time in the Tyrol, but you must please imagine it." ...|$|E
