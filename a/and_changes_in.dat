5|$|By the Late Middle Ages (approx 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, {{probably}} because {{of the success of}} infantry tactics <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> weaponry. However, because such tactics left the knight unmounted, the role of the war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become a thing of the past, replaced by lighter, unarmoured horses.|$|E

5|$|According to Aonuma, the team's {{starting}} point for development was the Wii version of Twilight Princess: feeling they had not fully realized their goal of creating a vast and realistic world with Twilight Princess, they used their previous work {{as a foundation for}} the next title. They also sought to create a memorable experience equivalent to , by that time considered the series' most memorable title. Development lasted around five years, and according to series producer Shigeru Miyamoto, the game's budget was considered quite high for a Nintendo project. The development time was initially estimated at three years, but difficulties <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the game's development extended development time by a further two years: despite this, Miyamoto felt that this was not wasted development time as the first two years went into experimentation. By June 2011, the game was complete aside from fine tuning and balancing its mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} process whereby an organism becomes {{better able to}} live in its habitat or habitats. Ecological factors such as habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition {{have been shown to}} greatly influence gray wolf craniodental plasticity, which is an adaptation of the cranium and teeth due to the influences of the environment. Similarly, the dire wolf was a hypercarnivore, with a skull and dentition adapted for hunting large and struggling prey; the shape of its skull and snout changed across time, <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the size of its body have been correlated to climate fluctuations.|$|E

5|$|Although Mansfield's transformations between Jekyll and Hyde {{included}} lighting {{changes and}} makeup designed to appear different under colored filters, it was mainly accomplished by the actor's facial contortions <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> posture and movement. As Hyde, Mansfield was hunched {{over with a}} grimacing face and claw-like hands; he spoke with a guttural voice and walked differently than he did as Jekyll. The effect was so dramatic that audiences and journalists speculated {{about how it was}} achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber prosthetic, that he applied chemicals, and that he had a mask hidden in a wig, which he pulled down to complete the change.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimate}} of a horse's age {{can be made}} from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough {{estimate of}} a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.|$|E
5|$|By {{the release}} of the game's second demo in March 2011, the team's goals for the mod had {{expanded}} to a total overhaul of Brawl to better match Melees gameplay mechanics. A newer build added 11 characters and was first playable at the Genesis 2 tournament. The second demo, released on April 15, 2012, added four new characters as well as more stages <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> multiple characters' gameplay mechanics. Players of this second demo reported a number of bugs, but these were fixed shortly afterwards in version 2.1. A demo version numbered 2.5 was announced on September 10, 2012; it featured changes such as balance updates, aesthetic improvements, stage updates, and palette swaps for the characters. Version 2.5 was released on December 28.|$|E

5|$|Coexist {{features}} a minimalist musical style with spatial arrangements, loose song structure, little dynamism, and experimentation with tension. Its songs are characterised by sparse {{elements such as}} simple chord progression, keyboard ostinatos, and fading motifs, while Smith's production incorporates both programmed beats and live percussion instruments. Coexist touches on themes of heartbreak, loneliness, and intimacy. The lyrics, written by guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim, address a failing relationship <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> a romance with inner monologues and simple metaphors.|$|E
5|$|Colors {{accepted}} by the breed registry include chestnut, bay and seal brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with pangaré markings). Bays with white markings are the most popular. Norman Cobs are known as calm, willing horses with strong personalities. The breed's Thoroughbred ancestry gives them energy and athleticism, and makes them mature faster than other draft breeds. They show great endurance when ridden, and are relatively hardy, accepting outdoor living <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> climate. Traditionally the Norman Cob had its tail docked, a practice that continued until January 1996, when the practice became illegal in France.|$|E
5|$|Franklin asked Timothy Folger, {{his cousin}} twice removed (Nantucket Historical Society), a Nantucket Island whaling captain, for an answer.

Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the Gulf Stream and giving it the name by which it is still known today. He offered this information to Anthony Todd, secretary of the British Post Office, but it was ignored by British sea captains.|$|E

5|$|From the 1840s, use of {{the river}} declined, {{as a result of}} {{competition}} from the railways, <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> coastal shipping. Littlehampton grew in importance as a port and after years of resistance by the people of Arundel, the customs house was moved there in 1864. The Mid-Sussex Railway opened their line from Horsham to Pulborough and Petworth in 1859, which was extended to Ford and Littlehampton in 1863. Receipts from tolls had peaked at £2044 for the five years from 1835 to 1840, when a dividend of 11.8 percent was paid, but dropped quickly, raising just £389 for years between 1870 and 1875, when the dividend was 1 percent.|$|E
5|$|His opponents {{learned from}} Napoleon's innovations. The {{increased}} importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his {{creation of a}} highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> artillery practices. As {{a result of these}} factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defenses, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers. Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century operational mobility underwent change.|$|E
5|$|House sparrows can {{breed in}} the {{breeding}} season immediately following their hatching, and sometimes {{attempt to do}} so. Some birds breeding {{for the first time}} in tropical areas are only a few months old and still have juvenile plumage. Birds breeding for the first time are rarely successful in raising young, and reproductive success increases with age, as older birds breed earlier in the breeding season, and fledge more young. As the breeding season approaches, hormone releases trigger enormous increases in the size of the sexual organs <b>and</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> day length lead males to start calling by nesting sites. The timing of mating and egg-laying varies geographically, and between specific locations and years because a sufficient supply of insects is needed for egg formation and feeding nestlings.|$|E
