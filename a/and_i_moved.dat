25|$|Upon his {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of England at the Union of the Crowns in 1603, James VI <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> his court to London. One of his first acts from London was to establish the royal postal service between London and Edinburgh, {{in an attempt to}} retain control over the Scottish Privy Council.|$|E
25|$|John Knox (1505–1572), a Scot who {{had spent}} time {{studying}} under Calvin in Geneva, returned to Scotland and urged his countrymen to reform the Church in line with Calvinist doctrines. After a period of religious convulsion and political conflict culminating in {{a victory for the}} Protestant party at the Siege of Leith the authority of the Catholic Church was abolished in favour of Reformation by the legislation of the Scottish Reformation Parliament in 1560. The Church was eventually organised by Andrew Melville along Presbyterian lines to become the national Church of Scotland. King James VI <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> the Church of Scotland towards an episcopal form of government, and in 1637, James' successor, Charles I and William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury, attempted to force the Church of Scotland to use the Book of Common Prayer. What resulted was an armed insurrection, with many Scots signing the Solemn League and Covenant. The Covenanters would serve as the government of Scotland for nearly a decade, and would also send military support to the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War. Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II, despite the initial support that he received from the Covenanters, reinstated an episcopal form of government on the church.|$|E

The house, on 8232 avenue de Gaspé near Jarry Park, was Robinson's residence when he played for the Montreal Royals during 1946. In a letter read during the ceremony, Rachel Robinson, Jackie's widow, wrote: [...] "I remember Montreal and that house very well and have always had warm feeling for that great city. Before Jack <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> to Montreal, we had just been through some very rough treatment in the racially biased South during spring training in Florida. In the end, Montreal was the perfect place {{for him to get}} his start. We never had a threatening or unpleasant experience there. The people were so welcoming and saw Jack as a player and as a man." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1988, Love aborted {{her acting}} career and left New York, {{returning}} to the West Coast, citing the [...] "celebutante" [...] fame she'd attained as the central reason. She returned to stripping {{in the small town}} of McMinnville, Oregon, where she was recognized by customers at the bar. This prompted Love to go into isolation, so she relocated to Anchorage, Alaska, where she lived for three months to [...] "gather her thoughts," [...] supporting herself by working at a strip club frequented by local fishermen. [...] "I decided to move to Alaska because I needed to get my shit together and learn how to work", she said in retrospect. [...] "So I went on this sort of vision quest.

2500|$|In the , Lewis Hamilton {{ran into}} the back of Alonso's Renault, heavily {{damaging}} the rear wing of Alonso's car, as well as his own nosecone. Stewards did not seek to investigate the incident but critics alleged he braked (or did not accelerate as expected) in front of Hamilton causing Hamilton to crash into him. The telemetry data from Alonso's car proved these accusations to be wrong. Hamilton himself stated [...] "I was behind him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> to the right, and he moved to the right and that was it– a racing incident I guess". It was later revealed by McLaren that Hamilton's front wing, which was damaged when he hit Alonso earlier in the race, had broken seconds before the impact and has been identified as the cause of the crash. Alonso started the [...] with promising pace, qualifying on the front row in second place behind Kimi Räikkönen even though he had a light fuel load. He was running in fifth place when his engine blew on lap 35. He praised his team after finishing sixth in the , as he was behind the more competitive BMW cars at the end, and said that the result [...] "confirms the progress we have made, and is thanks to the hard work of everyone in the team".|$|E

60|$|He rose hastily, {{and moved}} towards the door.

[...] Clinton had made a similar motion during the 2008 convention roll call; however, Sanders (unlike Clinton in 2008) did not move to nominate Clinton by acclamation. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.|$|R

60|$|A {{few days}} later Simmo <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>moved</b> camp to a grove of birches just above the alder point.
