In the 1990s, Ijaz and his companies were contributors to Democratic Party institutions as well as the presidential candidacies of Bill Clinton.

5|$|In 1902 Victor Henri {{proposed}} <b>a</b> <b>quantitative</b> {{theory of}} enzyme kinetics, {{but at the}} time the experimental significance of the hydrogen ion concentration was not yet recognized. After Peter Lauritz Sørensen had defined the logarithmic pH-scale and introduced the concept of buffering in 1909 the German chemist Leonor Michaelis and his Canadian postdoc Maud Leonora Menten repeated Henri's experiments and confirmed his equation, which is now generally referred to as Michaelis-Menten kinetics (sometimes also Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics). Their work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely considered today a starting point in modeling enzymatic activity.|$|E

5|$|Newton's Second Law asserts {{the direct}} {{proportionality}} of acceleration to {{force and the}} inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements. However, while kinematics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain {{as to what is}} the proper definition of mass. General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales. With some justification, Newton's second law can be taken as <b>a</b> <b>quantitative</b> definition of mass by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.|$|E

It has been translated into multiple European languages as well as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Persian, and Xhosa.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, <b>a</b> <b>quantitative</b> study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The animal's sense organ is altered when it detects an object. This causes a perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not as we now think the brain. This in turn causes {{a change in the}} heart's heat, which causes <b>a</b> <b>quantitative</b> change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration {{in the heat of the}} heart also causes a change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|E
