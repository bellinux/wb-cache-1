Realizing that they will not be able to complete the delivery in time, and understanding firsthand the impossibility of Santa's job, Stewie and Brian abandon the delivery in lieu of another plan.|$|E
5|$|In July 1978, amid a {{financial}} crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented the group with two original ideas for their next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall, and the other would later become Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former to be their next album. Bob Ezrin co-produced, and he wrote a forty-page script for the new album. Ezrin based {{the story on the}} central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was {{the death of his father}} in World War II. This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled <b>and</b> <b>depressed</b> by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person.|$|E

5|$|Keynes did not lay out an {{explicit}} theory of price level. Early Keynesian models assumed wage and other price levels were fixed. These assumptions caused little {{concern in the}} 1950s when inflation was stable, but by the mid-1960s inflation increased and became an issue for macroeconomic models. In 1958 A.W. Phillips set {{the basis for a}} price level theory when he made the empirical observation that inflation and unemployment seemed to be inversely related. In 1960 Richard Lipsey provided the first theoretical explanation of this correlation. Generally Keynesian explanations of the curve held that excess demand drove high inflation and low unemployment while an output gap raised unemployment <b>and</b> <b>depressed</b> prices. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Phillips curve faced attacks on both empirical and theoretical fronts. The presumed trade-off between output and inflation represented by the curve was the weakest part of the Keynesian system.|$|E
5|$|Little Busters! story {{revolves}} around the main protagonist Riki Naoe, a young male high school student. When Riki was a child, his parents died, leaving him hopeless <b>and</b> <b>depressed.</b> He was saved by a group—three boys and a girl, all his age—who referred to themselves as the Little Busters, a group dedicated to fighting evil and preserving justice. The leader of the group was Kyousuke Natsume who had a younger sister named Rin. The other two members were Masato Inohara and Kengo Miyazawa, who were friends despite being rivals. They took Riki out and played together with him during his time of need, making him the fifth Little Busters member. In time, Riki enjoyed playing with them, and his grief over his parents gradually faded away. When the story begins, Riki and his friends are seemingly in their second year of high school, except for Kyousuke {{who is in his}} third year. They still hang out together, and enjoy their school life.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to operate out of Genoa, intercepting and inspecting merchantmen and cutting-out suspicious vessels in both enemy and neutral harbours. Nelson formulated ambitious plans for amphibious landings and naval assaults to frustrate {{the progress of}} the French Army of Italy that was now advancing on Genoa, but could excite little interest in Hotham. In November Hotham was replaced by Sir Hyde Parker but the situation in Italy was rapidly deteriorating: the French were raiding around Genoa and strong Jacobin sentiment was rife within the city itself. A large French assault at the end of November broke the allied lines, forcing a general retreat towards Genoa. Nelson's forces were able to cover the withdrawing army and prevent them from being surrounded, but he had too few ships and men to materially alter the strategic situation, and the British were forced to withdraw from the Italian ports. Nelson {{returned to}} Corsica on 30 November, angry <b>and</b> <b>depressed</b> at the British failure and questioning his future in the navy.|$|E

Neil and Madeleine arrive {{at the home of}} the wealthy plantation owner, Charles Beaumont. Charles's love of Madeleine prompts him to meet Murder secretly in Murder's sugarcane mill, operated entirely by zombies. Charles wants to convince Madeleine to marry him and solicits Murder's supernatural assistance.

5|$|The single's {{music video}} was co-directed by Carey and Daniel Pearl. It was {{inspired}} by the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll and a dream Carey had one night. The video begins with scenes of a man leaving his home one early morning; only his feet are shown. Carey is first seen residing in the derelict house, {{in the middle of a}} large meadow. She awakes, sad <b>and</b> <b>depressed,</b> wearing battered and disheveled clothing. As she walks down the stairs, Carey sits on the staircase, lamenting in agony at her loneliness. As the video climaxes, Carey is seen finally leaving the foyer, apparently for the first time in many years, escaping from the misery she once called home. As she reaches the outskirts of the property, Carey mounts a horse, which assists her in jumping over the barbed fence. After leaving, Carey is seen smiling for the first time in the video, while waiving her arms in the air.|$|E

During an argument with Nick Sharon trips and falls, giving birth to a stillborn baby girl. After a paternity test, Nick is revealed to be the baby's father. Sharon finds solace with the Newman ranch's handyman Diego Guittierez (Greg Vaughan), who had been dating Nick's sister Victoria, and her infidelity results in a breakup with Nick.

5|$|On 5 November 1827 Antoinette von Leykam became Metternich's second wife. She {{was only}} twenty, and their marriage, a small affair at Hetzendorf (a village just outside Vienna), drew {{considerable}} criticism. Antoinette's grace and charm soon won over Viennese society. The same day British, Russian and French forces destroyed the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Navarino. Metternich worried that further intervention would topple the Ottoman Empire, upsetting the balance so carefully created in 1815. To his relief the new British Prime Minister Wellington and his cabinet were equally fearful of giving Russia {{the upper hand}} in the Balkans. After another round of his proposals for congresses was rejected, Metternich stood back from the Eastern Question, watching as the Treaty of Adrianople was signed in September 1829. Though he publicly criticised it for being too harsh on Turkey, privately he was satisfied with its leniency and promise of Greek autonomy, making it a buffer against Russian expansion rather than a Russian satellite state. Metternich's private life was filled with grief. In November 1828 his mother died, and in January 1829 Antoinette died, five days after giving birth to their son, Richard von Metternich. After fighting tuberculosis for many months, Metternich's son Viktor, then a junior diplomat, died on 30 November 1829. Consequently, he spent Christmas alone <b>and</b> <b>depressed,</b> worried by the draconian methods of some of his fellow conservatives and by the renewed march of liberalism.|$|E
