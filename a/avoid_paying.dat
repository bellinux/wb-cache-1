5|$|An {{important}} {{concern for}} Barnes, when {{returning from the}} United Kingdom to Australia, was to <b>avoid</b> <b>paying</b> customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included good quality English cloth, in very short supply in Australia at this time. Hearing a rumour that Customs officials were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee.|$|E
5|$|Not {{included}} in the official number of fatalities were deaths that were recorded as pneumonia. Workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from carbon monoxide poisoning (brought on {{by the use of}} gasoline-fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels), and a classification used by Six Companies to <b>avoid</b> <b>paying</b> compensation claims. The site's diversion tunnels frequently reached , enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle exhaust gases. A total of 42workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia; none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning. No deaths of non-workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period.|$|E

5|$|UBS France {{executive}} Patrick de Fayet {{was among}} three local branch executives being investigated. UBS wealth management bankers allegedly {{broke the law}} by enabling French taxpayers to hide their assets in UBS-controlled offshore assets to <b>avoid</b> <b>paying</b> taxes. The bankers undertook to direct their French clients' assets to UBS's Switzerland operation, rather than keep the money in France. UBS set aside approximately US$2 billion in expected liability for its currency rigging and French tax evasion cases.|$|E
5|$|In 1447 {{the local}} painter's guild elected Lochner as their {{representative}} municipal councilor, or Ratsherr. The appointment implies {{that he had}} lived in Cologne since at least 1437, as only those who had been living in the city for ten years could take up the position. He had not taken up citizenship immediately, possibly to <b>avoid</b> <b>paying</b> the 12 guilder fee. He was obliged to act as Ratsherr, and on 24 June 1447 he became a burgher of Cologne. The role of municipal councilor could only be held for a one-year term, with two years vacated before reoccupation. Lochner was re-elected for a second term in the winter of 1450–51, but died in office.|$|E
5|$|The Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway {{served as}} a post road {{in the years that}} followed. At some point, the section of the highway between Palmyra and Marion, {{initially}} a corduroy road, was rebuilt as a plank road and tolled. The highway fell into disrepair over the years, leading travelers to conceive ways to <b>avoid</b> <b>paying</b> toll. The toll booths were eventually removed, and the road was later covered with dirt and converted into a stage road. By the 1920s, the state of New York had assumed ownership of the Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway. In the mid-1920s, it became part of NY72, a north–south highway extending from NY52 in Naples to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Pultneyville by way of the western side of Canandaigua Lake.|$|E

5|$|The next {{incident}} {{proved to}} be a major event in the coming of the American Revolution. On the evening of May 9, 1768, Hancock's sloop Liberty arrived in Boston Harbor, carrying a shipment of Madeira wine. When custom officers inspected the ship the next morning, they found that it contained 25 pipes of wine, just one fourth of the ship's carrying capacity. Hancock paid the duties on the 25 pipes of wine, but officials suspected that he had arranged to have more wine unloaded during the night to <b>avoid</b> <b>paying</b> the duties for the entire cargo. They did not have any evidence to prove this, however, since the two tidesmen who had stayed on the ship overnight gave a sworn statement that nothing had been unloaded.|$|E
5|$|George I died on 11/22 June 1727 {{during one}} of his visits to Hanover, and George II succeeded him as king and elector at the age of 43. The new king decided not to travel to Germany for his father's funeral, which far from {{bringing}} criticism led to praise from the English who considered it proof of his fondness for England. He suppressed his father's will because it attempted to split the Hanoverian succession between George II's future grandsons rather than vest all the domains (both in Britain and Hanover) in a single person. Both British and Hanoverian ministers considered the will unlawful, as George I did not have the legal power to determine the succession personally. Critics supposed that George II hid the will to <b>avoid</b> <b>paying</b> out his father's legacies.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the decline of Bristol's Iceland trade for 'stockfish' (freeze dried cod) was a hard blow to the local economy, encouraging Bristol merchants to turn west, launching unsuccessful voyages of exploration in the Atlantic by 1480 in search of the phantom island of Hy-Brazil. More recent research, however, has shown that the Iceland trade was never more than a minor part of Bristol's overseas trade and that the English fisheries off Iceland actually increased during the late 15th and 16th centuries. In 1487, when king Henry VII visited the city, the inhabitants complained about their economic decline. Such complaints, however, were not uncommon among corporations that wished to <b>avoid</b> <b>paying</b> taxes, or which hoped to secure concessions from the Crown. In reality, Bristol's customs accounts show that the port's trade was growing strongly during the last two decades of the fifteenth century. In great part this was due of the increase of trade with Spain.|$|E
25|$|In September 2014, Sorrentino {{was charged}} with tax fraud, {{allegedly}} <b>avoiding</b> <b>paying</b> taxes on $8.9 million. According to the US Attorney, Sorrentino and his brother, Marc, established S corporations that paid for personal expenses and failed to report income.|$|R
50|$|The federal {{government}} also imposes a gift tax, assessed {{in a manner}} similar to the estate tax. One purpose is to prevent a person from <b>avoiding</b> <b>paying</b> estate tax by giving away all his or her assets before death.|$|R
25|$|A new stationhouse at Tompkinsville {{opened on}} January 20, 2010, with {{turnstiles}} installed {{for the first}} time. The turnstiles were installed because passengers often <b>avoided</b> <b>paying</b> the fare by exiting at Tompkinsville, and taking a short walk to the St. George ferry terminal.|$|R
5|$|Lehman {{played with}} the Millionaires until the 1925–26 season. During that time, Lehman {{and some of his}} {{teammates}} were involved in a humorous incident when going back to Canada after an exhibition game against the Montreal Wanderers in New York City. In New York, Lehman's wife bought numerous women's designer outfits, after being treated to a shopping spree by him. When going back to Canada, Lehman, on the advice of Cyclone Taylor, who was both a professional ice hockey player and a Canadian immigration officer, split up all outfits among his teammates to <b>avoid</b> <b>paying</b> additional taxes {{he would have had to}} pay if he had brought all the clothing by himself at once; this puzzled the Customs officers. In 1922–23, the Millionaires were renamed the Maroons, and joined the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). The WCHL was renamed to the Western Hockey League in 1925–26; however, the league disbanded at the conclusion of that season. While playing for the Millionaires, Lehman appeared in six Stanley Cup finals, losing every time, except in his first season, in 1914–15.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, the Rockets {{improved their}} regular season mark to 46–36 but were eliminated {{in the first}} round of the playoffs by the Seattle SuperSonics 4 games to 1 (marking the first of 6 postseason meeting between the two franchises). Although Malone won the MVP in that season, and new owner Charlie Thomas expressed interest in renewing his contract, in the following offseason, the Rockets traded him to the Philadelphia 76ers for Caldwell Jones, to <b>avoid</b> <b>paying</b> his salary. When the Rockets finished a league worst 14–68, Celtics coach Bill Fitch was hired to replace outgoing Del Harris, and after winning a coin flip with the Indiana Pacers to obtain the first pick of the 1983 NBA Draft, the Rockets selected Ralph Sampson from the University of Virginia. Sampson had good numbers as the Rockets finished only 29–53 in the 1983–1984 season, averaging 21 points and 11 rebounds per game and earning the NBA Rookie of the Year award.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{used the}} {{opportunity}} of travelling around England to pursue his business interests, cutting many deals. When he was rested from the first match against Yorkshire, {{he stayed in the}} capital and made deals at the London Exhibition. During breaks in play, or when Australia was batting and he had already been dismissed, he often spent the time inspecting local factories and talking to other businesspeople. An important concern for Barnes, when returning to Australia by boat after the tour, was to <b>avoid</b> <b>paying</b> customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included fine English cloth, which was in very short supply in Australia. Hearing a rumour that customs officers were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee. Upon returning to Australia, Barnes opted out of first-class cricket to focus on business interests. He wrote a newspaper column, in which he often criticised cricket administrators and the small share of revenue they gave to players. Barnes wrote in a confrontational manner, often lampooning and angering the authorities.|$|E
50|$|Students {{usually go}} on the {{exchange}} programme in their third year of studies in the 4-year LL.B. Students on the exchange programme pay only tuition fees at the NUS Law rate, thus <b>avoiding</b> <b>paying</b> the often higher fees of the host institutions.|$|R

SABMiller has denied these allegations.|$|R
50|$|On {{the release}} of a (DC5) British hits album in the mid-'70s, Clark resided in the US for a year, thus <b>avoiding</b> <b>paying</b> UK taxes in Britain on the {{proceeds}} of that release. The British government challenged this but lost the case in court.|$|R

50|$|The route {{has been}} in {{existence}} since prehistoric times and there are folk-tales about famous people from history using it. When turnpikes were installed between York and Coxwold, drovers would take their cattle this way because it was wide enough and meant they <b>avoided</b> <b>paying</b> the tolls.|$|R
5000|$|... {{treat the}} IRA account as {{his or her}} own, which means {{that he or she}} can name a {{beneficiary}} for the assets, continue to contribute to the IRA and avoid having to take distributions. This <b>avoids</b> <b>paying</b> the extra 10% tax on early distributions from an IRA.|$|R

50|$|Exemptions can {{be quite}} substantial.
