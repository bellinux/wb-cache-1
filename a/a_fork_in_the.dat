5|$|Crash Boom Bang!s stages {{resemble}} board games, as each {{play area}} is split {{into a number}} of squares. The game takes place among four players, with the computer assigned to spare players. All players simultaneously roll dice. The number each player rolls is the amount of squares they move forward. Depending on the type of square that the player lands on, Wumpa Fruit (which is used as points during the race) can be won or lost, an item can be obtained, a special event might be triggered, or a mini-game might commence. If a player lands on <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road, the player will have to select the desired direction with either the stylus or the control pad.|$|E

5|$|CR106 {{originated}} in 1824, when {{the road was}} chartered for the New Turnpike and headed from Monroe to Haverstraw. Back in the 1820s, what is now Southfields was known as Monroe.

The turnpike continued eastward, meeting the Old Turnpike at <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road. At the fork, part of the road became NY210 in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering.

Three more years later, the route became known as County Highway416. In 1919 and 1920, the western section of the road was reconstructed. After a bridge was built to cross a river in 1923, a new route, making up part of the original Warwick Turnpike, became NY17A.|$|E

In fact, these species are not pedate, but pseudopedate. What appears to be <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rachis {{is in fact the}} junction between the rachis and a basal pinna.

Both basal pinnae are further divided and subdivided to create the other fingerlike segments. Therefore, even though they appear structurally similar, the longest and most central fingerlike segment represents the tip of the frond, pinnately divided into pinnae (the first level of division of the frond), while the two shorter fingerlike segments immediately on either side of it are pinnae, pinnately divided into pinnules (the second level of division).
