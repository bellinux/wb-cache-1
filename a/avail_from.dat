The level of interference experienced by the mesh nodes rises when the network becomes more connected {{and the number of}} radios per node increases. To mitigate interference experienced by the wireless mesh nodes while taking advantage from the multi-channel network aspect, we propose a novel Interference-aware Game based Channel Assignment algorithm, named IGCA. We prove through simulations that our proposed algorithm contributes in alleviating the node interference degree, fairly allocates interfaces to network non-overlapping channels and increases simultaneous transmissions in the network. An improvement up to 50 % of both interference degree and simultaneous connections is particularly observed in comparison with a prominent existing approach - the Near-optimal Partially Overlapping Channel Assignment algorithm...|$|E

The connection is accomplished via bypassing a number of reservoirs and pumping stations in a small transmission system in AlAin City of UAE. The system has a major transmission pumping station that hosts four fixed-speed pumps, a main 1200 mm line, storage reservoirs and boosting pumps besides few other connection pipes. The study objective is achieved by conducting a comprehensive transient analysis to evaluate the potential of pressure rises associated with various operating scenarios. The savings in energy cost associated with the proposed bypass setting are estimated at about $ 850, 000 per year. Such savings {{are found to be}} available after a payback period of one year and one month to cover the capital cost of the needed bypasses and pressure relief valves...|$|E
40|$|A large {{fraction}} of top quark events in collisions at 1. 8 will contain additional soft hadronic jets from gluon bremsstrahlung off the quarks and gluons {{in the hard}} processes, gg →→. These extra jets can cause complications when attempting to reconstruct m_t from the invariant mass of combinations of final-state quarks and leptons. We show how such soft radiation cannot be unambiguously associated with either initial-state radiation or or with final-state radiation off the b quarks. The top quarks can radiate too, {{and in fact the}} pattern of radiation has a very rich structure, which depends on the orientation of the final-state particles with respect to each other and with respect to the beam. We calculate the full radiation pattern of soft jets in the soft gluon approximation and compare with several approximate forms which are characteristic of parton shower Monte Carlos. The implications for top mass measurements are discussed.

There is also a shift from an outsider to an insider as far as observation is concerned. It definitely gives teachers a great insight into their teaching {{and at the same time}} proves effective in improving their teaching. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. It first investigated the barriers that Iranian high school students face while speaking. This investigation was made by interviewing both students (language institutes and schools) and teachers. Teachers’ comments on the students’ answers and teachers’ separate answers on the causes of speaking problems were elicited.  It then made a comparison between the willingness to communicate (WTC) of high school and language institute students after the reflection (self-monitoring) of the teacher. To achieve this purpose 32 high school and 32 language institute students spent 10 sessions with a teacher who had previously reflected upon the speaking barriers collected from participants comments through oral interviews. The results of the study, using a independent t -test, clearly showed that language institute students were much more willing to communicate. Several reasons were also found to be highly important regarding students, teachers, and course materials.

Cloud computing is anticipated {{as the next}} generation high-tech paradigm for tomorrow’s promise [1]. It provides several utilities as revolutionary gigantic paradigms where clients can remotely store valuable and confidential information as to <b>avail</b> <b>from</b> on-demand high quality computing resources [2]. While data outsourcing reduces {{the burden on the}} cloud users (CUs) from local storage and management, it brings several open problems related to the security and privacy of customer’s outsourced data. On the other hand, cloud computing eradicates their physical control of data reliability and security, which can be addressed through the cooperation of three parties: the cloud service provider (CSP), the third party auditor (TPA) and the CU. Cloud computing has always been referred as virtualization of an existing server or data center. Subsequently, cloud computing is acknowledged as virtualization of existing data or data centers, providing multipurpose application support and enormous utility to remotely available users or clients [3]. This phenomenon leads to the cloud acting as a service, where services are provided upon request based on subscription or pay-per-use [4]. The cloud computing environment stores the valuable information and offers attractive user applications with reliable service support [5]. With the emergence of new technology, new categories of clouds and services are introduced such as supercomputing as service (SCaaS) and high-performance computing as a service (HPCaaS).|$|E
40|$|Flexible {{licensing}} {{model is}} a necessary enabler of the technical and procedural complexities of Spectrum Access System (SAS) -based sharing framework. The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the effectiveness of 3. 5 GHz Licensing Framework - based on census tracts as area units, areas whose main characteristic is population. As such, the boundary of census tract does not follow the edge of wireless network coverage. We demonstrate why census tracts are not suitable for small cell networks licensing, by (1) gathering and analysing the official census data, (2) exploring the boundaries of census tracts which are in the shape of nonconvex polygons and (3) giving a measure of effectiveness of the licensing scheme through metrics of area loss and the number of people per census tract with access to spectrum. Results show that census tracts severely impact the effectiveness of the licensing framework since almost entire strategically important cities in the U. S. will not <b>avail</b> <b>from</b> spectrum use in 3. 5 GHz band. Our paper does not seek to challenge the core notion of geographic licensing concept, but seeks a corrective that addresses the way the license is issued for a certain area of operation. The effects that inappropriate size of the license has on spectrum assignments lead to spectrum being simply wasted in geography, time and frequency or not being assigned in a fair manner. The corrective is necessary since the main goal of promoting innovative sharing in 3. 5 GHz band is to put spectrum to more efficient use. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, conferenc...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} how the Group of Seventy-Seven and China frame the concept of climate change and {{especially}} examines how, {{and to what extent}} they connect third generation of human rights to the problems and solutions of the climate change issue. Discourse analysis and framing has been used in order to examine how the developing countries approach the complex issue of climate change. In addition to the environmental discourses suggested by Dryzek (1997), the thesis propose an alternative human rights environmental discourse taking into account the globally divided world into developed and developing countries. This discourse captures the approach taken by the G- 77 in a more complete form than what the discourses proposed by Dryzek manages to do. Climate change poses a huge threat to the fulfilment of human rights. Despite this the traditional approach towards responding the climate change has been to see it as an ecological or an economic problem. Social and human right implications have received little focus within these negotiations. This thesis argue that human rights can contribute to respond to the effects of climate change in an fair and balanced way, including elements such as equity and distribution. It shows however, that when developing countries frame the changes they implicit refer to the third generation of human rights, and then in particular the right to development. In this way they manages to <b>avail</b> <b>from</b> the discussion on a states obligation to fulfil individual human rights {{while at the same time}} ensure that developed countries take their responsibility for dealing with the adverse effects of climate change...|$|E
40|$|Finance plays {{a crucial}} role in {{accelerating}} any business activity/economic development and fisheries sector is not an exception. The economic activities of the fishing villages mainly depend upon the availability of credit at reasonable cost to enhance production and income. Lack of institutional credit is an obstacle to further development of the small-scale fisheries sector. In this context the researcher has attempted to study the credit needs of the fishermen, various sources of institutional credit availed by them and their experience with financial institutions. This is an empirical study completed through field study. Thoothukudi District has been selected as the study area. In the study area only 152 respondents have accessed the various institutional agencies and availed 250 loans for meeting the expenditures. The data were collected using a survey schedule. Mean, standard deviation, co-efficient of variation and the One-way ANOVA were used. It is inferred that most of loans are <b>availed</b> <b>from</b> the Cooperative banks (42 %) followed by Commercial banks (21 %). The vallam craft owners have borrowed the highest number of loans followed by catamaran and FRPboat owners. From the analysis it could be understood that majority of the loans <b>availed</b> <b>from</b> the financial institutions are less than Rs. 25, 000 and the financial institutions fail to come forward to provide higher loan amount for the craft owners. Consequently for want of further loans they fall in the clutches of middlemen. Thus {{it is clear that the}} financial institutions play a very little role in bringing up the economic status of the fishermen in Thoothukudi District...|$|R
