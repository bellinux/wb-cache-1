5000|$|After {{some initial}} {{research}} in networking technologies, API was contracted by Interlan (another early Ethernet networking company, subsequently acquired by Micom {{and then by}} Racal Electronics PLC) to develop an adjunct to its 10Base5 Ethernet transceivers and network interface cards (NICs, or network cards). This adjunct product was to extend {{the distance between the}} transceiver and the NIC by way of fiber optics, as the distance was severely limited by the 15-pin <b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Interface</b> (AUI) <b>cable</b> used in this connection.|$|R
50|$|Apple <b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Interface</b> (AAUI) is a {{mechanical}} re-design by Apple {{of the standard}} <b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Interface</b> (AUI) used to connect Ethernet transceivers to computer equipment. AUI was popular in the era before the dominance of 10BASE-T networking that started in the early 1990s; AAUI {{was an attempt to}} make the connector much smaller and more user friendly.|$|R

5000|$|The NE2000, {{using the}} 16-bit ISA bus of the PC AT {{followed}} in 1988. This also added limited 8-bit and later 16-bit DMA uses thin Ethernet; the second ("B") revision added an <b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Interface</b> (AUI) port {{to support a}} transceiver, and later models NE1000T and NE2000T added built-in 10BASE-T support.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Interface</b> (AUI) is a {{physical}} and logical interface defined in the original IEEE 802.3 standard for 10BASE5 Ethernet. The (optional) physical interface consists of a 15 pin connection that provides a path between an Ethernet node's Physical Signaling and the Medium <b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> (MAU), sometimes {{also known as a}} transceiver. An AUI cable may be up to 50 meters long, although frequently the cable is omitted altogether and the MAU and MAC are directly attached to one another.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Interfaces</b> {{that were}} used with 10BASE5 [...] "thick net" [...] in the 1980s and 1990s used DA15 {{connectors}} for connectivity between the Medium <b>Attachment</b> <b>Units</b> and (Ethernet) network interface cards, albeit with a sliding latch to lock the connectors together {{instead of the usual}} hex studs with threaded holes. The sliding latch was intended to be quicker to engage and disengage and to work in places where jackscrews could not be used for reasons of component shape.|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in Internet communications' products such as high-speed switches, SerDes (serial-deserializer) elements and XAUI (X= 10 G, <b>attachment</b> <b>unit</b> <b>interface)</b> ports has energized the need for process technologies that support both digital and analog (mixed-signal) elements at radio frequencies (RF). In order for these products to be competitive, process technologies that support analog/mixed-signal and RF must heavily leverage the manufacturing benefits of conventional high-speed digital CMOS processes...|$|R
2500|$|They are {{commonly}} used to analyze a pair of coupled transmission lines to {{determine the amount of}} cross-talk between them, if they are driven by two separate single ended signals, or the reflected and incident power of a differential signal driven across them. [...] Many specifications of high speed differential signals define a communication channel in terms of the 4-Port S-Parameters, for example the 10-Gigabit <b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Interface</b> (XAUI), SATA, PCI-X, and InfiniBand systems.|$|R
50|$|Thicknet coaxial cabling is {{used with}} Ethernet 10BASE5 networks, has a maximum cable length of 500 meters and {{transmission}} speeds of 10 Mbit/s. It's expensive and not commonly used, {{though it was}} originally used to directly connect computers. The computer {{is connected to the}} transceiver at the <b>cable</b> from the <b>attachment</b> <b>unit</b> <b>interface</b> of its network card using a drop cable. Maximum thicknet nodes are 100 on a segment. One end of each cable is grounded.|$|R
5000|$|A vampire tap (also {{called a}} {{piercing}} tap) is a device for physically connecting a station, typically a computer, {{to a network}} that uses 10BASE5 cabling. This device clamps onto and [...] "bites" [...] into the cable (hence the vampire name), inserting a probe through a hole drilled using a special tool through the outer shielding to contact the inner conductor, while other spikes bite into the outer conductor. The vampire tap usually has an integrated AUI (<b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Interface),</b> from this a short multicore cable connects to the network card in the station.|$|R
50|$|AAUI signals {{have the}} same description, function, and {{electrical}} requirements as the <b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Interface</b> (AUI) signals of the same name, as detailed in IEEE 802.3-1990 CSMA/CD Standard, section 7, with the exception that most hosts provide only 5 volts of power rather than the 12 volts required for most AUI transceivers. An adapter containing a power supply to provide the required 12 volts was available from Apple to permit connection of standard AUI transceivers to an AAUI port—this facilitated direct connection to 10BASE-F (fibre optic) and 10BASE5 (ThickNet) Ethernet networks, for which AAUI transceivers were not available.|$|R
50|$|Original Ethernet's shared {{coaxial cable}} (the shared medium) traversed a {{building}} or campus to every attached machine. A scheme known as {{carrier sense multiple access}} with collision detection (CSMA/CD) governed {{the way the}} computers shared the channel. This scheme was simpler than competing token ring or token bus technologies. Computers are connected to an <b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Interface</b> (AUI) transceiver, which is in turn connected to the cable (with thin Ethernet the transceiver is integrated into the network adapter). While a simple passive wire is highly reliable for small networks, it is not reliable for large extended networks, where damage to the wire in a single place, or a single bad connector, can make the whole Ethernet segment unusable.|$|R
50|$|The {{widespread}} {{availability of}} Ethernet-based networking {{in the early}} 1990s led to the swift disappearance of both LocalTalk and PhoneNet. They remained in use for some time in low-cost applications and applications where Ethernet was not available, but as Ethernet became universal on the PC most offices were installing it anyway. Early models of Power Macintosh and the Macintosh Quadra supported 10BASE-T via the Apple <b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Interface</b> while still supporting LocalTalk-based networking. For older Macintosh computers {{that did not have}} built-in Ethernet expansion options, a high speed SCSI-to-Ethernet adapter was available, and was particularly popular on PowerBooks. This enabled all but the earliest Macintosh models to access a high speed Ethernet network.|$|R
50|$|An Ethernet hub, active hub, network hub, {{repeater}} hub, multiport repeater, {{or simply}} hub is a network hardware device for connecting multiple Ethernet devices together {{and making them}} act as a single network segment. It has multiple input/output (I/O) ports, in which a signal introduced at the input of any port appears at the output of every port except the original incoming. A hub works at the physical layer (layer 1) of the OSI model. A repeater hub also participates in collision detection, forwarding a jam signal to all ports if it detects a collision. In addition to standard 8P8C ("RJ45") ports, some hubs may also come with a BNC or an <b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Interface</b> (AUI) connector to allow connection to legacy 10BASE2 or 10BASE5 network segments.|$|R
5000|$|Ethernet {{had become}} almost {{universal}} by 1990, {{and it was}} time to build Ethernet into Macs direct from the factory. However, the physical wiring used by these networks was not yet completely standardized. Apple solved this problem using a single port on the back of the computer into which the user could plug an adaptor for any given cabling system. This FriendlyNet system was based on the industry-standard <b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Interface</b> or AUI, but deliberately chose a non-standard connector that was smaller and easier to use, which they called [...] "Apple AUI", or AAUI. FriendlyNet was first introduced on the Quadra 700 and Quadra 900 computers, and used across much of the Mac line for some time. As with LocalTalk, a number of 3rd party FriendlyNet adaptors quickly appeared.|$|R
50|$|Early Macs {{used the}} {{built-in}} serial ports for LocalTalk, which {{set up a}} fast (at the time) network between two machines. Later, a modified AUI port was added named Apple <b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Interface</b> {{to provide a more}} user friendly version of 10BASE2 cabling and adapters, with Apple's version known as FriendlyNet. As this was an implementation of an Ethernet physical layer it was indifferent to the protocols used - and allowed connection of Macintosh machines using LocalTalk, TCP/IP, or other protocols assuming it was supported by programs. Eventually as Ethernet over twisted pair emerged as the dominate method for connecting computers, all Macs adopted the now familiar modular 8 pin modular jack as standard. Fibre Channel adapters are also available for the Mac Pro and the discontinued Xserve, generally for connection to large storage subsystems and/or high bandwidth multimedia applications.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. By {{using the}} dynamic {{reconfigurable}} transceiver in {{high speed interface}} design, designer can solve critical technology problems such as ensuring signal integrity conveniently, with lower error binary rate. In this paper, we designed a high speed XAUI (10 Gbps Ethernet <b>Attachment</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Interface)</b> to transparently extend the physical reach of the XGMII. The following points are focused: (1) IP (Intellectual Property) core usage. Altera Co. offers two transceiver IP cores in Quartus II MegaWizard Plug-In Manager for XAUI design which is featured of dynamic reconfiguration performance, that is, ALTGX_RECONFIG instance and ALTGX instance, we can get various groups by changing settings of the devices without power off. These two blocks can accomplish function of PCS (Physical Coding Sub-layer) and PMA (Physical Medium Attachment), however, with higher efficiency and reliability. (2) 1 + 1 protection. In our design, two ALTGX IP cores are {{used to work in}} parallel, which named XAUI 0 and XAUI 1. The former works as the main channel while the latter redundant channel. When XAUI 0 is out of service for some reasons, XAUI 1 will start to work to keep the business. (3) RTL (Register Transfer Level) coding with Verilog HDL and simulation. Create the ALTGX_RECONFIG instance and ALTGX instance, enable dynamic reconfiguration in the ALTGXB Megafunction, then connect the ALTGX_RECONFIG with the ALTGX instances. After RTL coding, the design was simulated on VCS simulator. The validated result indicates that the packets are transferred efficiently.
