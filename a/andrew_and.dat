John, Bishop of Bosnia, put Hungary under a new interdict {{in the first half}} of 1234, because Andrew had not {{dismissed}} his non-Christian officials despite his oath of Bereg. <b>Andrew</b> <b>and</b> Archbishop Robert of Esztergom protested against the bishop's act at the Holy See.|$|E

5|$|Andrew {{exchanged}} {{letters with}} Aaron the Tyrant, Voivode of Moldavia, {{who had been}} captured by Sigismund Báthory because of his attempts {{to make peace with}} Poland and the Ottoman Empire. The pope's special envoy, Martio Malacrida, tried to convince Andrew to accept the post of the ambassador of Poland in Rome, but Andrew again refused. He said, his homeland would require his presence, because Sigismund's anti-Ottoman policy could not be continued for long. Letters found on one of Stephen Báthory's retainers suggested that <b>Andrew</b> <b>and</b> his brother sent letters to the leaders of the Székely commoners who had risen up against Sigismund Báthory in February 1596. Sigismund III of Poland summoned <b>Andrew</b> <b>and</b> Stephen before the Senate, but Pope Clement VIII intervened on the brothers' behalf.|$|E

5|$|Hungarian chronicles have {{preserved}} a story full of fabulous or anachronistic {{details of}} the two brothers' ensuing wanderings. For instance, they narrate that <b>Andrew</b> <b>and</b> Levente were captured by Cumans, but the latter only arrived in Europe in the 1050s. Having faced many hardships, <b>Andrew</b> <b>and</b> Levente established themselves {{in the court of}} Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev (r. 1019–1054) in the late 1030s. The grand prince gave his daughter, Anastasia in marriage to Andrew. Kristó writes that Andrew, who had up to that time remained pagan, was baptized on this occasion.|$|E

5|$|In August 1591, Maximilian of Habsburg, {{who still}} claimed Poland and Lithuania, sent his envoy to Andrew seeking Transylvanian support against Sigismund III. Andrew {{emphasized}} that being under Ottoman suzerainty, Transylvania could not openly support Maximilian, {{but he also}} promised that Sigismund Báthory would not prevent the mustering of Transylvanian soldiers to fight in Poland. In the same month, Sigismund Báthory's plan to enable the Jesuits to return to Transylvania {{gave rise to a}} serious family conflict, because both <b>Andrew</b> <b>and</b> Balthasar refused to support the prince at the Diet. According to contemporaneous gossips, <b>Andrew</b> <b>and</b> his two brothers decided to dethrone Sigismund, replacing him with Balthasar. Pope Clement VIII sent a papal nuncio, Attilio Amalteo, to Transylvania to mediate a reconciliation.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian lord Paul Šubić again {{turned against}} <b>Andrew</b> <b>and</b> joined the camp of Charles Martel in early 1295, but Charles died in August. Within two months, the Babonići also rebelled against Andrew. Early the next year, the {{recently}} widowed King Andrew visited Vienna and arranged a marriage with Duke Albert's daughter Agnes. The Kőszegis soon rose up in open rebellion. Andrew {{declared war on}} the rebels, and Archbishop Lodomer excommunicated them. <b>Andrew</b> <b>and</b> Albert jointly seized the Kőszegis' main fort at Kőszeg in October, but could not subdue them. Andrew's mother seems to have died {{at the end of}} the year because references to her activities disappear from the contemporaneous documents.|$|E

5|$|After Béla's {{withdrawal}} from Halych, Roman Mstislavich {{returned with the}} assistance of Rurik Rostislavich, Prince of Belgorod Kievsky. They tried to expel <b>Andrew</b> <b>and</b> his Hungarian retinue, but the Hungarians routed the united forces of Mstislavich and Rostislavich. A group of local boyars offered the throne to Rostislav Ivanovich, a distant cousin of the imprisoned Vladimir Yaroslavich. Béla III sent reinforcements to Halych, enabling Andrew's troops to repel the attacks. Andrew's reign remained unpopular in Halych, because the Hungarian soldiers insulted local women and did not respect Orthodox churches. Consequently, the local boyars allied with their former prince, Vladimir Yaroslavich, who had escaped from captivity and returned to Halych. Duke Casimir II of Poland also supported Vladimir Yaroslavich, and they expelled <b>Andrew</b> <b>and</b> his retinue from the principality in August 1189 or 1190. Andrew returned to Hungary after his defeat. He did not receive a separate duchy from his father, who only gave him estates and money. On his deathbed, Béla III, who had pledged to lead a crusade to the Holy Land, ordered Andrew to fulfill his vow. Andrew's father died on 23 April 1196, and Andrew's older brother, Emeric, succeeded him.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottomans {{defeated}} {{the armies of}} the Holy League {{in a series of}} battles in 1596, Transylvanian noblemen sent letters to Andrew, offering him the principality. After realizing that neither the pope nor the Polish king would support him against Sigismund Báthory, Andrew declared that he was ready to make peace with him. He returned to Warmia where he was ordained subdeacon on 4 January 1597. <b>Andrew</b> <b>and</b> Stephen even announced that they would not intervene in Transylvania. Their envoys also started discussions with Sigismund Báthory about the compensation for their expropriated Transylvanian estates.|$|E
