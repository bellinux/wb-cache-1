50|$|When an {{autodialer}} connects an <b>answered</b> <b>call</b> to a live agent, it {{is often}} called a predictive dialer or power dialer. A predictive dialer uses realtime analysis to determine the optimal time to dial more numbers, whereas a power dialer simply dials a pre-set number of lines when an agent finishes the previous call.|$|E
50|$|An aborted call {{is made to}} the {{subscriber}} line. This automated service “listens” {{to check}} for ringback tones, busy signals, <b>answered</b> <b>call,</b> voice mail automated answering, or network operator injected messages such as “the number called is not in service”. This method benefits from being international and covering mobile phones. However, the check {{can take up to}} 30 seconds to complete (average time 9 seconds). This delay can be handled well by the use of AJAX background processes for example by allowing the user to continue filling in other fields in a form while the line test is performed.|$|E
50|$|Fearing for his {{own safety}} and also being asked by the American {{military}} officials in Japan to end the case quietly, Jack Waltz attempted to murder the culprit in the entire case. Unbeknownst to Waltz, Waltz himself is the last target of the culprit, Kevin Yoshino. Yoshino is Hunter's student and the two help crafted the plan to revenge against Waltz and Murphy for attempting to assassinate Hunter during the Middle East operation to ensure that Hunter will not receive the Silver Star decorations. Hunter survived the attempted murder but is severely wounded and discharged from the Navy, only to face misfortune from Fujinami and Moriyama. Conan, who happened to realize that Waltz {{is about to be}} murdered, push Waltz away, causing Yoshino who is sniping from Bell Tree Tower to switch target. While under fire, a mysterious sniper Subaru Okiya shot to Yoshino, causing Yoshino to shock as the range of fire is greatly excesses his ability or Hunter's. Yoshino take cover in the observation deck of Bell Tree Tower and took Ayumi hostage. While Yoshino is fighting with FBI, Okiya attempted to take down Yoshino from afar, but being blocked from clear line of sight and lack of lighting to guide the target. Conan, having realized Okiya's plan, kicked the ball from his position which exploded into fireworks, causing night vision Yoshino is wearing to blind and Okiya is able to shoot and disable Yoshino's weapon, making way for Ran and FBI to take him to custody. Okiya later <b>answered</b> <b>call</b> by James Black, the chief of FBI team in Japan, with Shuichi Akai's voice.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} possible timecorrelation of <b>answered</b> <b>call</b> arrivals in sets of real GSM telephone traffic data.

Besides this diurnal rate change, the number of call arrivals in a second is found perfectly uncorrelated to the number of arrivals in other seconds and Poisson distributed, with good consistency by Chi-Square - test evaluation. Uniform and accurate whiteness of call arrivals per second is verified in all hours, regardless the time of the day.

40|$|Public health {{researchers}} frequently rely on random-digit dialing (RDD) telephone {{surveys in}} monitoring trends in health behavior and evaluating health promotion interventions. RDD response rates have declined {{during the past}} decade, and cost-effective methods to increase response rates are needed. The authors evaluated two levels of enhanced calling efforts in an RDD survey of cancer-related health behavior in the State of Washington. The first level of enhanced calling effort was 1 month after 11 original calling attempts to a household, when the authors attempted up to 11 recalls. The second level was 6 months after the first <b>answered</b> <b>call,</b> when the authors recalled those persons {{who could not be}} interviewed. Enhanced calling efforts increased the overall survey response rate by 11 percent. Nine percentage points of the increase were attributable to call backs. There were demographic differences among the participants reached at different levels of calling effort, but no consistent associations of level of calling effort with health behavior related to alcohol use, smoking, diet, or health screening. Marginal costs for interviews completed with enhanced calling efforts were about 50 percent higher than costs for interviews reached in the first 11 calls. The authors concluded that enhanced calling efforts may be justified, because they increase confidence in the generalizability of survey results. However, the authors found very little change in survey results by including interviews from persons who were difficult to reach and to interview...|$|E

40|$|Male {{and female}} African Clawed Frogs (Xenopus laevis) produce calls {{and engage in}} dueting in both silt-filled ponds and {{laboratory}} aquaria. Previous research has established that males produce different <b>answer</b> <b>calls</b> in response to receptive (11 - 12 Hz click rate) and nonreceptive (click rate of 4 Hz) female calls. In the present study, in addition to male <b>answer</b> <b>calls,</b> male phonotropism behaviors were measured {{for the first time}} during playbacks of natural female rapping and ticking calls as well as synthetic stimuli consisting of ticking calls with 90 -msec interclick intervals (ICIs) and rapping calls with 250 -msec ICIs. Also, the results show that males approach a loudspeaker significantly more often in response to rapping calls and remain longer in the proximity of the speaker. Moreover, males produce <b>answer</b> <b>calls</b> more frequently in response to female rapping calls and produce few <b>answer</b> <b>calls</b> in response to female ticking calls. Synthetic ticking calls with 90 -msec ICIs evoked an intermediate phonotaxis response, whereas synthetic rapping calls with 250 -msec ICIs evoked the same level of phonotaxy as do natural ticking calls. These results show that male phonotaxy is strongly, although not entirely, determined by the rhythmic characteristics of female calls, whereas antiphonotaxy appears to be determined by female call rhythm alone.
