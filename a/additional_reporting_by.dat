40|$|Abstract — Aims: To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between number and type of past-year stressful experiences and alcohol consumption, {{with a focus on}} how gender, poverty, and psychological vulnerability moderate this association. Methods: Data from 26 946 US past-year drinkers 18 years of age and over, interviewed in the 2001 – 2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), were used to construct multivariate linear regression models predicting six measures of drinking pattern and volume. Results: There was a consistent positive relationship between number of past-year stressors experienced and all measures of heavy drinking. Frequency of heavy (5 + drinks for men; 4 + drinks for women) drinking increased by 24 % with each <b>additional</b> stressor <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> men and by 13 % with each <b>additional</b> stressor <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> women. In contrast, the frequency of moderate drinking (< 5 drinks for men; < 4 drinks for women) decreased as stress levels increased. Job-related and legal sources of stress were more strongly associated with alcohol consumption than were social and health-related stress. Men showed a stronger association than women between the number of stressors and the most consumption measures; they also responded more strongly to the presence of any legal and job-related stress. Having an income below the poverty level intensified the effects of job-related stress, but having a mood or anxiety disorder did not affect any of the associations between stress and consumption. Conclusions: Stress does not so much lead individuals to drink more often as to substitute larger quantities of alcohol on the days when they do drink. Treatment and brief interventions aimed at problem drinkers might benefit from addressing the issue of tension alleviation and the development o...|$|R

40|$|Formative market {{research}} {{is the first step}} in developing evidence-based sanitation marketing programs. In Malawi, the design, implementation and evaluation of rural sanitation marketing programs has been limited. This study applied a mixed methodological approach to examine the dynamic interactions between the supply and demand of sanitation in three rural districts. The supply assessment identified an extremely limited range of latrine options. Sanitation suppliers reported very low household demand for their existing latrine options. An <b>additional</b> constraint <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> suppliers was householders' perception of a hardware subsidy for latrine construction. The demand assessment found a key constraint of constructing an unlined pit latrine was their short time-in-use (11 – 13 months). Householders expressed despondency at having to consistently rebuild collapsed, unlined pit latrines. For brick-lined latrines, a key barrier was affordability combined with an over-estimation of construction costs. Key motivations to construct brick-lined latrines included product attributes and social drivers. Wide variations in access to income and use of micro-finance organizations were recorded within and across the study sites. Formative {{market research}} is an iterative process from which new lines of investigation arise.

40|$|Lightning {{discharges}} generate broadband electromagnetic pulses with a peak {{component in}} the very low frequency (VLF; 3 - 30 kHz) range. VLF waves propagate through the Earth-ionosphere waveguide with relatively low attenuation, enabling the detection of these radio atmospherics at great distances from the lightning discharge. A new technique of long-range (<= 6000 km) global lightning geolocation via sferic detection is presented. This new technique catalogs the dominant variation in expected received waveforms {{in a set of}} waveform banks, which are then used to estimate the propagation distance and accurately determine the arrival time. Using three sensors in a trial network, this new technique is used to demonstrate a median accuracy of 1 - 4 km, depending on the time of day. An overall cloud-to-ground (CG) stroke detection efficiency between similar to 40 and 60 % is estimated by correlating individual lightning stroke events to data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). <b>Additional</b> events <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> the trial network are shown to have a tight spatial clustering to storm clusters identified by NLDN, suggesting that many of the unmatched events correspond to weak cloud-to-ground strokes, M components, or cloud pulses. Exploiting an empirical correlation between peak VLF field strength and peak current values <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> NLDN, we also provide unvalidated estimates of the peak current and lightning channel polarity. The trial network does not distinguish between cloud and ground discharges, so these peak current estimates only relate to an Earth-referenced channel current for the subset of reported events that are return strokes...|$|R
