5000|$|The hypnotized subject's {{existing}} beliefs {{may also}} {{lead them to}} create an alien abduction story under hypnosis; hypnotised individuals tend to believe thoughts, images, or ideas they have while under hypnosis originate from personal experience rather than other sources, such as the therapist's suggestions. This can explain Budd Hopkins' observation that patients came to believe they had been abducted even though their hypnotist was skeptical of the abduction phenomenon. Thomas E. Bullard said {{the presence or absence}} of hypnosis as a method for memory retrieval in abduction claimants seems to effect descriptions of the abductors. Hypnotically <b>assisted</b> <b>recall</b> is more likely to produce descriptions of the [...] "standard" [...] gray humanoid, while cases in which hypnosis was not used [...] "include more variety". According to Newman and Baumeister (1996), [...] "there is increasing evidence that hypnosis does not simply reveal the UFO abduction phenomenon - it plays a major role in creating it". Although it is widely accepted that memories of alien abductions are false, they are generally believed wholeheartedly by the individual.|$|E

The usability of image-based <b>assisted</b> <b>recall</b> systems {{is limited by}} the large number of images through which the user must navigate. Rewind is a scalable system of everyday mobile phones and supporting web services that we developed to explore how client- and server-side image processing can be used to both lower bandwidth needs and streamline user navigation. It has been in use since August 2007 as part of a pilot study super-vised by an epidemiologist to evaluate its utility for improving re-call of dietary intake, as well as other shorter and more exploratory trials. While the system is designed to accommodate a range of image processing algorithms, in this first prototype we rely on sim-ple filtering techniques to evaluate our system concept. We present performance results for a configuration in which the processing oc-curs on the server, and then compare this to processing on the mo-bile phones. Simple image processing on the phone can address the narrow-band and intermittent upload channels that characterize cellular infrastructure, while more sophisticated processing tech-niques can be implemented on the server to further reduce the num-ber of images displayed to users...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this {{research}} is to assess whether performance on remembering faces with attached positive information and faces with attached negative information was enhanced when compared to faces with attached neutral information, or the control of faces with attached names only. It was hypothesised that likeability score would significantly differ for faces with attached positive information and attached negating information, an effect that was found in this research. In total, five measure of memory were used to assess the effect of attached social information on memory for faces- time taken to complete match pair grids, time taken between clicks on match pair grids, distance error on match pair grids, correct <b>assisted</b> name <b>recall,</b> correct <b>assisted</b> attached information <b>recall</b> and correct <b>assisted</b> type of attached information recall. Three conditions were used (positive/neutral attached information, negative/neutral attached information and control condition) to measure the effect of mate relevant information on memory test scores. For the three match pair measures, no significant effect of attached mate relevant information was found. Non-significant results were found for correct <b>assisted</b> name <b>recall</b> and correct <b>assisted</b> type of attached information, however for correct recall for attached information, a significant effect was found, suggesting that source memory of information can enhance subsequent memory for faces.

PARTNERS is testing collaborative care by placing secondary practitioners in primary care, who take a coaching approach to improve client’s wellbeing across mental and physical health, and social and community life. During our formative evaluation we supported practitioners to follow PARTNERS through training, manuals, supervision and researcher support. To evaluate fidelity we recorded sessions between practitioners and clients, then interviewed individuals using tape <b>assisted</b> <b>recall</b> (6 sessions, 6 practitioner interviews, 6 client interviews). We coded transcriptions using a theoretical framework developed from our collaborative care model. We are currently analysing the codes drawing from a realist approach, looking at ways the practitioner—client sessions did and did not align with our model, to identify patterns for how this may have affected practitioner and client experiences. Interim findings show that one practitioner administered PARTNERS with less fidelity than the other. One practitioner listened to and emotionally supported clients, while also taking action on their behalf. The second practitioner focused on developing a shared understanding of clients’ needs, and agreeing and working towards person-centred goals. All six clients appreciated the support they received from the service, but those who worked with the second practitioner were more able to describe the progress they had made towards improving their lives. We will discuss final findings and the adaptations we made to our model in response, in preparation for the clinical trial currently taking place...|$|E
40|$|Eyewitness {{testimony}} {{is critical in}} both criminal court and civil court, so determining the most reliable method to gain information from witnesses is imperative. Past {{research in this area}} has focused on false memory, <b>assisted</b> <b>recall,</b> stress, and event perception. A gap exists in the current literature regarding the best method to gain the most accuracy in recall. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate free recall, cued recall, and recognition, in an attempt to examine the accuracy of eyewitness memory. The study utilized a quantitative design to assess the accuracy of eyewitness memory as measured by results on free-recall, cued recall, and recognition tests. The theoretical foundation for this study was the theory of information processing, which contends that information is processed in stages and combines visual cognition, memory, and memory recall; therefore, this theory applies to the study by helping determine the most accurate way for individuals to recall events. Introduction to Psychology students were shown a video, then asked to recall what they saw using either free recall, cued recall, or recognition. A one-way between-subjects analysis of variance was utilized to determine whether there were significant differences in the number of items recalled as a function of recall format. Results suggested that participants were more accurate with the utilization of recognition techniques for recall, as opposed to the free or cued-recall. The importance of evaluating effective methods to promote accurate eyewitness {{testimony is}} to advance forensic science. The implications for social change include the ability to have more effective methods to gain accurate eye-witness testimony, thereby assisting with proper outcomes during trials...|$|E

40|$|Psychological processes, {{especially}} anxiety, {{may have}} an influence on visceral perception and gastrointestinal (GI) motor function, thereby eliciting or aggravating GI symptoms. Anxiety {{has been shown to}} affect gastric sensorimotor function but it is conceivable that anxiety affects not only the stomach but also other parts of the GI tract, such as the rectum. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether experimentally induced anxiety would alter rectal sensorimotor function in health. Eighteen healthy subjects (mean age 26. 97 +/- 1. 75 years) underwent a rectal barostat study. To assess sensitivity to rectal distension and rectal compliance, stepwise isobaric distension was performed during anxious and neutral emotional state. Two methods of emotion induction were used simultaneously: audiotape <b>assisted</b> <b>recall</b> of a neutral or anxious autobiographical experience and viewing of a set of validated neutral or fearful facial expressions. Anxiety levels were assessed by means of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and anxiety scores on a Likert scale. Anxiety scores (AUC: 2. 11 +/- 1. 45 vs 42. 78 +/- 6. 17 mm mmHg, P < 0. 0001) and STAI scores (36. 06 +/- 2. 09 vs 45. 56 +/- 2. 52, P = 0. 005) confirmed the efficacy of anxiety induction. Rectal compliance was not different during anxious compared with neutral emotional state (11. 62 +/- 0. 93 vs 10. 61 +/- 0. 96 mL mmHg(- 1), P = NS). Pressure and volume thresholds inducing discomfort during rectal distension were not significantly different during anxious and neutral emotional state (29. 33 +/- 1. 41 vs 29. 78 +/- 1. 49 mmHg, P = NS and 249. 26 +/- 16. 22 vs 231. 38 +/- 21. 19 mL, P = NS respectively). Contrary to its influence on gastric sensorimotor function, experimentally induced anxiety does not affect rectal sensitivity or rectal compliance in healthy subjects. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: While {{family therapy}} has been {{demonstrated}} {{to be an effective}} intervention, practitioners in the field face a number of challenges that provide the impetus for this project. Therapists commonly report feeling confused by the theoretical debates and the demands placed on them by empirically supported treatments, and there is also significant variability between clinicians in quality of practice and within their individual practice. While the therapist variable is consistently recognised as the most robust predictor of outcomes, there is a paucity of research on how this variable exemplifies skilled performance and expertise, and gaps in understanding of the therapist’s contribution to therapeutic change. Method: This investigation examines elite practice to develop an understanding of the perceptual-affective-cognitive mechanisms underpinning the habits of mind, which mediate expertise in the naturalistic practice of family therapy. Two in-depth studies were used; the first investigating procedural knowledge and the second focusing on the dynamic thinking process. Six novice and seven elite family therapists contributed narratives of complex and straightforward cases in Study 1, and narratives of in-themoment mental events while conducting family therapy (using video <b>assisted</b> <b>recall)</b> in Study 2. The case narratives were analysed using modified grounded theory and open coding, with each study generating four categories of mental events associated with good practice. A novice and elite practitioner comparison of these categories was then conducted to find patterns of convergence within and divergence between the groups. Results: The study of procedural knowledge identified four categories of habits of mind mediating expertise; a) Mental preparation; b) Deliberate monitoring; c) Quality of engagements; d) Using emotions and managing the emotional climate. The study of dynamic thinking processes generated four categories of in-the-moment perceptualaffective- cognitive mental activity; a) Therapy as a balancing act; b) Sensing relationships; c) Noticing and promoting micro-changes; d) Engaging in reflection and evaluation. Elite practitioners demonstrated high convergence in all these categories, while novices exhibited higher variability and less consistency. Conclusion: Relational-emotional expertise, clinical expertise and reflective practices emerged as over-arching features of expertise in family therapy. Some novices demonstrated some of the elite-like mental processes and, like elite practitioners, engaged in high levels of self-reflection and meta reflective practices, generated family specific mental models that linked the relational process with clinical symptoms, and established an emotional place in the matrix of relationships. The elite practitioners developed an emotional-intuitive understanding, and used relational-clinical practices to facilitate changes in collaboration with their client-family...|$|E

The primary objective of this pilot {{study was to determine}} if the MyEnergyBalance app (with use of images) in combination of the associated website improves dietary recall compared to diet analysis on the MyEnergyBalance website alone. We also generated preliminary data on the usability of the MyEnergyBalance iPhone app and website. This pilot study was a crossover study design of healthy, college students. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups. Both groups consumed their normal diet for the first day with one group recording their food intake with image functions of the MyEnergyBalance app, while the other group did not use the app. On the second day, all participants logged into the MyEnergyBalance website to record their food intake from the previous day; one group using the images from the app to <b>assist</b> in <b>recalling</b> what they ate, while the other group recalled what they ate from memory. The diet analysis results were compared to those obtained using the ASA 24 website. The groups were then crossed over to the opposite vs no-image <b>assisted</b> <b>recalls.</b> Ten participants (seven females and three males) aged 20 to 22 years completed this study. The average BMI of all participants was 23. 12 kg/m 2 (ranging from 18. 95 to 32. 28 kg/m 2). There was no statistically significant differences in the estimates of the energy intake between the MyEnergyBalance app and website compared to ASA 24. The SUS mean score for the MyEnergyBalance app and website was 86 and 69. 5, respectively. A strong, negative correlation was found between the system usability scale scores and the absolute differences in energy intake of the MyEnergyBalance app and ASA 24. Although {{we were not able to}} demonstrate a significant benefit of the images from the iPhone app at improving food recall (perhaps due to the small study sample size), we were able to demonstrate a high usability score for the iPhone app, average usability score for the website, and a significant correlation between subjects 2 ̆ 7 usability scores and relative accuracy of the subjects 2 ̆ 7 food recall using the images from the iPhone app. A future study with a larger sample size will hopefully provide more information on the efficacy of image-based food recalls...|$|R

This {{takes the form of}} a {{dialogue}} between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter, in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men, notably Cei (Kay) and Bedwyr (Bedivere). The Welsh prose tale Culhwch and Olwen (...) , included in the modern Mabinogion collection, has a much longer list of more than 200 of Arthur's men, though Cei and Bedwyr again take a central place. The story as a whole tells of Arthur helping his kinsman Culhwch win the hand of Olwen, daughter of Ysbaddaden Chief-Giant, by completing a series of apparently impossible tasks, including the hunt for the great semi-divine boar Twrch Trwyth. The 9th-century Historia Brittonum also refers to this tale, with the boar there named Troy(n)t.

This behaviour seems mainly driven by {{the difficulty of the}} response task: respondents with a more complex history of receipt according to the records were more likely to confirm the false preload. Personality also seemed related to the probability of confirming. Predictors of satisficing, indicators of satisficing on other items in the survey, and characteristics of the survey and interviewer were not predictive of confirming the false preload.

40|$|As {{the number}} of {{children}} who testify in court increases, so does the need to obtain accurate information.;The present PhD thesis aimed to examine possible ways of trying to improve child and young adult witnesses' testimony. The author was particularly interested in questioning methods with children, young adults' person descriptions, and face recognition and identification ability of both children and young adults (including the ability to recognize different race faces). Chapter 1 reviews the relevant literature.;Chapter 2 presents a meta-analysis of identification studies involving children. Chapter 3 examines Estonian investigators' questioning styles with child witnesses focusing on the length and type of details in children's answers to questions. Chapter 4 examines the effects of using a person in young adult witnesses' visual field as a comparison (or 'standard) to <b>assist</b> their <b>recall</b> of a previously seen, different person. Chapters 5 and 6 present the comparison of Estonian children's and young adults' face recognition ability of different race faces, as there appear to have been published no studies of the cross-racial effect in less 'westernised' societies, such as in Estonia. Also new sequential target presentation methods were used.;All results are discussed with reference to previous findings...|$|R
40|$|The recent AAAS call {{to improve}} {{undergraduate}} biology education suggested university instruction {{should focus on}} teaching core concepts like matter and energy, evolution, and systems and core competences like quantitative reasoning, modeling and integrating disciplines. My {{research has focused on}} how undergraduate biology students organize their knowledge of biological systems and how they reason about the myriad interactions and potential outcomes inherent to these systems. I will report ongoing research into students’ model construction during an introductory biology course and during clinical interviews 2 years after the course. My colleagues and I have found students’ models change dramatically in both quantity and quality of biological relationships during the course. We believe this change in model quality comes from cognitive restructuring as students change from linear thinkers to more systemic thinkers. The enduring effect of model construction is manifest when, after a couple of years, some students are able to use the structure of their mental model to <b>assist</b> in <b>recalling</b> missing details and to apply their mental model to a new scenario. Model construction in Introductory Biology may be a useful tool as we strive to increase students’ understanding of biological interactions and stochasticity...|$|R
