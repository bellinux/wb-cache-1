5|$|Advaita {{literally}} means non-duality, {{and it is}} a monistic {{system of}} thought. It deals with the non-dual nature of Brahman and Atman. Advaita is considered the most influential sub-school of the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy. Gaudapada {{was the first person to}} expound the basic principles of the Advaita philosophy in a commentary on the conflicting statements of the Upanishads. Gaudapada's Advaita ideas were further developed by Shankara (8th century CE). King states that Gaudapada's main work, Māṇḍukya Kārikā, is infused with philosophical terminology of Buddhism, and uses Buddhist arguments and analogies. King also suggests that there are clear differences between Shankara's writings and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> those in the Upanishads. Radhakrishnan, on the other hand, suggests that Shankara's views of Advaita were straightforward developments of the Upanishads and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara derive from the Upanishads.|$|E

More significantly, Zeratul discovers that some force has successfully combined Protoss and Zerg genetic material, creating a race of incredibly powerful hybrids. Zeratul travels to Aiur to probe the corpse of the Zerg Overmind for information on an apocalyptic prophecy, and unexpectedly finds Tassadar in an ethereal form. Memories found in the Overmind's cortex depict {{a vision of a}} future in which Kerrigan is killed, whereupon the hybrids (led by an entity known only as the Dark Voice) take control of the Swarm, destroy all other forms of life, then obliterate the Zerg as well. The Protoss are the last society left standing against the Dark Voice's armies. Zeratul finds Raynor, knowing his intent to track down and defeat the Queen of Blades, and tells him to spare her life.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the final}} of these models, the {{business}} model, as with the constituency model, there are several different metrics incorporated in performance measurement. However, whereas the different measures came from different competing factions under the constituency model – meaning that constituents prioritize between fulfilling the various measures and that the measures themselves <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> each other – these measures are generally sequential in nature (e.g., ensuring good product quality leads to {{a rise in the}} second metric of customer satisfaction, which improves the third measure of financial performance), with each considered as important to be maximized as the others.

Antoinists are also sometimes Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, adepts of reiki, yoga, or t'ai chi ch'uan, or former Catholics.

500|$|While other fierce Hindu goddesses like Kali depict {{severing}} {{the heads}} of demons and are associated with ritual self-decapitation, Chhinnamasta's motif reverses the ritual head-offering, offering her own head to the devotees (attendants) in order to feed them. Thus, she symbolises the aspect of Devi as a giver, like Annapurna, the goddess of food, and Shakambhari, the goddess of vegetables, or a maternal aspect. The element of self-sacrifice is the symbol of [...] "divine reciprocation" [...] by the deity to her devotees. As a self-sacrificing mother, she symbolises the ideal Indian woman; however, her sexuality and power <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the archetype. She subdues and takes the life-force of the copulating divine couple, signifying the aspect of the life-taker, like Kali.|$|E

500|$|Review did {{note that}} the [...] "Top 40" [...] songs do not always make for {{challenging}} songs, as many featured simple chord repetition throughout the song or simply following pre-programmed electronic keyboard or drum beats. However, most songs were found to feature at least one difficult instrument portion that {{would be fun to}} play. Reviews also noted that the censoring of songs in order to affirm a family-friendly rating is awkward, such as censoring the word [...] "whiskey" [...] from Don McLean's [...] "American Pie" [...] (8 times), and can ruin the enjoyment of some songs. Greg Miller of IGN further noted that these censoring <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the straight-up inclusion of other songs such as [...] "Gasoline" [...] by The Airborne Toxic Event which, Miller claims, is about sex.|$|E

Leng writes of Harrison's [...] "straining" [...] vocal on the track and [...] "banks of trilling 'Long and Winding Road' mandolins" [...] that <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the more subtle mood found elsewhere on the album. Ian Inglis describes Harrison's singing as one of his [...] "least impressive performances" [...] and writes of the composition generally: [...] "It may be a love song or a hymn of salvation but, unlike songs where this duality strengthens their impact (such as 'Isn't It a Pity'), here it sits uneasily between the two." [...] With a different musical arrangement and the [...] "melodramatic delivery" [...] of a singer like Shirley Bassey, Inglis suggests, [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] might have found some success.|$|E
500|$|When Horne {{found out}} that the 14th RWF had not moved and that their attack had been pushed back to 8 July, he summoned Ivor Philipps to Corps {{headquarters}} and sacked him. General Douglas Haig, commander of the BEF, noted this event in his diary. He wrote: [...] "visited HQ XV Corps and saw General Horne. He was very disappointed with the work of the... 38th Welsh Div". Haig further commented that Philipps was relieved of his command as the majority of the division had [...] "never entered" [...] the woods despite the [...] "most adequate... bombard", had suffered [...] "under 150 casualties" [...] during their attack and that: [...] "a few bold men [...] entered the Wood found little opposition". Historian Don Farr wrote that Haig's entries <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the facts and that he relied heavily on what Horne had told him. Farr states that Horne's account to Haig was self-serving, did no justice [...] "to the difficulties confronting the troops on the ground", and did not acknowledge the failure of the bombardment. He also suggests that the sacking of Philipps may have been political, by a distrusting officer corps towards a perceived political appointee.|$|E
