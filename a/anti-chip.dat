40|$|Abstract: The {{water channel}} CHIP 28 {{accounts}} for the high water permeability of proximal tubules and thin descending limbs of Henle; a homologous water channel, WCH-CD, in the apical membrane of collecting duct principal cells, may be the vasopressin-sensitive water channel. We show here that one antiserum, raised against CHIP 28, immunostains the basolateral membrane of collecting duct principal cells, in addition to staining CHIP 28 in other cells. This serum was named anti-basolateral integral protein (anti-BLIP) to distinguish it from other <b>anti-CHIP</b> 28 antisera. By Western blotting, BLIP serum recognized both CHIP 28 and MIP 26, and it stained lens fibers, which contain MIP 26 but not CHIP 28. BLIP antiserum immunoprecipitated a 28 -kDa band, a broad 35 - to 50 -kDa band, and an similar to 16 -kDa band from kidney papilla. It also stained the basolateral membrane of gastric parietal cells, which were not stained with <b>anti-CHIP</b> 28 or anti-MIP 26 antibodies. BLIP antiserum immunoprecipitated a 28 -kDa protein band from stomach; this protein was not precipitated by <b>anti-CHIP</b> 28 antibodies. These results suggest that basolateral membranes of principal cells and parietal cells contain a protein(s) that shares common epitopes with CHIP 28 and MIP 26. Finally, BLIP but not CHIP 28 antiserum stained mesothelial (but not epithelial) cells of toad urinary bladder, a further indication that the BLIP antiserum recognizes a protein distinct from CHIP 28...|$|E
40|$|Aquaporin-CHIP, a 28 kDa channel forming protein already {{referred}} to as CHIP 28, {{has been identified as}} the water channel in red blood cells as well as in mammalian renal tubule cells. Another member of the aquaporin family, WCH-CD, has been found in the apical membrane of collecting duct principal cells and may represent the ADH-sensitive water channel. The present study investigates the possible presence of CHIP 28 -like proteins in amphibian urinary bladder, where the presence of water channels has been postulated. For this purpose, we raised polyclonal antibodies against human erythrocyte CHIP 28. Immune serum precipitated a protein of about 30 kDa from the whole homogenate of urinary epithelial cells. By Western blotting, in addition to the reaction with the 30 kDa component, the immune serum reacted with higher molecular weight components from the bladder homogenate. The 30 kDa band was detected by Western blot only in bladders having a high water permeability. Moreover, a 30 kDa protein was also recognized in frog red blood cell membranes by the <b>anti-CHIP</b> 28 antibodies. In line with the immunoblotting studies, in immunohistofluorescence <b>anti-CHIP</b> 28 antibodies stained frog red blood cells and urinary bladder epithelial cells. However, in whole tissue water permeability studies apical treatment with the <b>anti-CHIP</b> 28 antibodies had no effect on either the hydrosmotic response to ADH or on the basal net water flow of the bladder. All together, these results indicate the presence in the frog red blood cells and urinary epithelium of proteins sharing immunological analogies with aquaporin-CHIP...|$|E
40|$|Figure S 1. Expression {{levels of}} AID, Hsp 90, and CHIP in various B cells and {{interaction}} of Hsp 90 with various AID variants. (A) Total extracts from parental Ramos B cells and its derived cell lines stably expressing AID-Flag/HA and AID-GFP {{were analyzed by}} Western blot (WB) with anti-AID to compare the protein level of each transgenic AID with the endogenous enzyme. Bands were quantified using ImageQuant, and the ratio (R) of tagged to endogenous AID is indicated. One of two independent experiments is shown. (B) Expression of Hsp 90 isoforms and of the Hsp 90 -associated E 3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (Fig. 4) in human Ramos and chicken DT 40 B cell lines. Total cell lysate lines were analyzed by Western blot using anti–Hsp 90 -�, anti–Hsp 90 -�, <b>anti-CHIP,</b> and antiactin. Apparent differences in expression between Ramos and DT 40 cells most likely reflect variations in the chicken epitopes because anti–Hsp 90 - � and <b>anti-CHIP</b> are mAbs raised against human proteins. One of two independent experiments is shown. (C) Kinetics of Hsp 90 isoforms and CHIP expression in purified naive mouse B cells activated with IL- 4 and LPS. Cells were harvested at different time points, lysed, and analyzed by Western blot using anti–Hsp 90 -�, anti–Hsp 90 -�, <b>anti-CHIP,</b> and antiactin. One of two independent experiments is shown. (D) AID oligomerization or phosphorylation is not necessary for Hsp 90 interaction. Interaction of Hsp 90 was tested by coimmunoprecipitations with AID mutants carrying the F 46 A/Y 48 A/R 50 G/N 51 A simultaneous mutations (FYRN), previously shown be defective for oligomerization (Patenaude et al., 2009), or the T 27 A and T 38 A phospho-null mutations (T 27 / 38 A). (E) The position of the tag on AID {{does not affect the}} association with Hsp 90 -�. HEK 293 T cells were cotransfected with Myc–Hsp 90 - � and GFP-AID, AID-GFP, A 2 -GFP, or GFP.

40|$|Abstract: The {{water channel}} protein CHIP 28 is {{responsible}} for the high constitutive plasma membrane permeability to water of erythrocytes, renal proximal tubule, and thin descending limb of Henle. The male reproductive tract is embryologically related to kidney and some segments, particularly the efferent ducts, exhibit a high rate of solute flux-dependent reabsorption of luminal fluid. To determine whether this could occur through water channels in the plasma membrane of reproductive tract epithelial cells, we used <b>anti-CHIP</b> 28 antibodies to localize this protein by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Western blotting of proteins from efferent duct homogenate indicated the presence of CHIP 28 in the efferent duct cells. By indirect immunofluorescence and protein A-gold immunolabeling, CHIP 28 was localized to the brush-border and basolateral membranes of nonciliated cells. Ciliated cells in the same epithelium showed no plasma membrane staining for CHIP 28. In accord with immunocytochemical findings, freeze-fracture of nonciliated efferent duct cells revealed a plasma membrane organization resembling that of renal proximal tubule cells that are rich in CHIP 28. The <b>anti-CHIP</b> 28 antibodies also stained plasma membranes of epithelial cells in the ampulla of the vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and prostate, but not the cells in seminiferous tubules, epididymis, and proximal parts of the vas deferens. Therefore, CHIP 28 may be a principal mediator of the transmembrane water transport in absorptive epithelial cells of efferent ducts, as well as in epithelia of several other segments of the male reproductive tract that show both secretory and reabsorptive functions...|$|E
40|$|Major {{phenotypic}} changes {{occur in}} red cell membranes during the perinatal period, but the underlying molecular explanations remain poorly defined. Aquaporin CHIP, the major erythroid and renal water channel, was studied in perinatal rats using affinity-purified <b>anti-CHIP</b> IgG for immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence microscopy. CHIP was not detected in prenatal red cells but was first identified in circulating red cells {{on the third}} postnatal day. Most circulating red cells were positive for CHIP by the seventh postnatal day, and this proportion rose to nearly 100 % by the 14 th day. The ontogeny of red cell CHIP correlated directly with acquisition of osmotic water permeability and inversely with Arrhenius activation energy. Only minor alterations {{in the composition of}} red cell membrane lipids occurred at this time. Immunohistochemical analysis of perinatal kidneys demonstrated a major induction of CHIP in renal proximal tubules and descending thin limbs at birth, coincident with the development of renal concentration mechanisms. Therefore, water channels are unnecessary for oxygen delivery or survival in the prenatal circulation, however CHIP may confer red cells with the ability to rehydrate rapidly after traversing the renal medulla, which becomes hypertonic after birth. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chitin is {{the most}} {{abundant}} biopolymer in marine ecosystems. However, there is no accumulation of chitin in the ocean-floor sediments, since marine bacteria Vibrios are mainly responsible for a rapid turnover of chitin biomaterials. The catabolic pathway of chitin by Vibrios is a multi-step process that involves chitin attachment and degradation, followed by chitooligosaccharide uptake across the bacterial membranes, and catabolism of the transport products to fructose- 6 -phosphate, acetate and NH 3. Principal Findings: This study reports {{the isolation of the}} gene corresponding to an outer membrane chitoporin from the genome of Vibrio harveyi. This porin, expressed in E. coli, (so called VhChiP) was found to be a SDS-resistant, heat-sensitive trimer. Immunoblotting using <b>anti-ChiP</b> polyclonal antibody confirmed the expression of the recombinant ChiP, as well as endogenous expression of the native protein in the V. harveyi cells. The specific function of VhChiP was investigated using planar lipid membrane reconstitution technique. VhChiP nicely inserted into artificial membranes and formed stable, trimeric channels with average single conductance of 1. 860. 13 nS. Single channel recordings at microsecond-time resolution resolved translocation of chitooligosaccharides, with the greatest rate being observed for chitohexaose. Liposome swelling assays showed no permeation of other oligosaccharides, including maltose, sucrose, maltopentaose, maltohexaose and raffinose, indicating that VhChiP is a highly-specific channel for chitooligosaccharides...|$|E

40|$|Cholangiocytes {{line the}} {{intrahepatic}} bile ducts and regulate salt and water secretion during bile formation, but the mechanism(s) regulating ductal water movement remains obscure. A water-selective channel, the aquaporin CHIP, was recently described in several epithelia, so {{we tested the}} hypothesis that osmotic water movement by cholangiocytes is mediated by CHIP. Isolated rodent cholangiocytes showed a rapid increase in volume {{in the presence of}} hypotonic extracellular buffers; the ratio of osmotic to diffusional permeability coefficients was > 10. The osmotically induced increase in cholangiocyte volume was inversely proportional to buffer osmolality, independent of temperature, and reversibly blocked by HgCl 2. Also, the luminal area of isolated, enclosed bile duct units increased after exposure to hypotonic buffer and was reversibly inhibited by HgCl 2. RNase protection assays, <b>anti-CHIP</b> immunoblots, and immunocytochemistry confirmed that CHIP transcript and protein were present in isolated cholangiocytes but not in hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that (i) isolated cholangiocytes and intact, polarized bile duct units manifest rapid, mercury-sensitive increases in cell size and luminal area, respectively, in response to osmotic gradients and (ii) isolated cholangiocytes express aquaporin CHIP at both the mRNA and the protein level. The data implicate aquaporin water channels in the transcellular movement of water across cholangiocytes lining intrahepatic bile ducts and provide a plausible molecular explanation for ductal water secretion. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of water-selective channels has been postulated {{to explain the}} high water permeability of erythrocytes and certain epithelial cells. The aquaporin CHIP (channel-forming integral membrane protein of 28 kDa), a molecular water channel, is abundant in erythrocytes and water-permeable segments of the nephron. To determine whether CHIP may mediate transmembrane water movement in other water-permeable epithelia, membranes of multiple organs were studied by immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunoelectron microscopy using affinity-purified <b>anti-CHIP</b> IgG. The apical membrane of the choroid plexus epithelium was densely stained, implying a role for CHIP in the secretion of cerebrospinal fluid. In the eye, CHIP was abundant in apical and basolateral domains of ciliary epithelium, the site of aqueous humor secretion, and also in lens epithelium and corneal endothelium. CHIP was detected in membranes of hepatic bile ducts and water-resorptive epithelium of gall bladder, suggesting a role in bile secretion and concentration. CHIP was not detected in glandular epithelium of mammary, salivary, or lacrimal glands, suggesting the {{existence of}} other water-channel isoforms. CHIP was also not detected within the epithelium of the gastrointestinal mucosa. CHIP was abundant in membranes of intestinal lacteals and continuous capillaries in diverse tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscle, thus providing a molecular explanation for the known water permeability of certain lymphatics and capillary beds. These studies underscore the hypothesis that CHIP {{plays a major role}} in transcellular water movement throughout the body. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two {{recently}} cloned water channels, CHTP 28 and WCH-CD, are homologous to MIP 26, {{an integral}} membrane channel-forming protein found in lens fiber plasma membranes. CHIP 28 {{is found in}} basolateral and apical plasma membranes of kidney proximal tubules and thin descending limbs of Henle, whereas WCH-CD is apically located in collecting duct principal cells. So far, the putative water channel that {{may be responsible for}} the high constitutive permeability of principal cell basolateral membranes has not been identified. Interestingly, freeze-fracture electron microscopy has shown that characteristic orthogonal arrays of intramembrane particles (OAPs) are found on the basolateral plasma membranes of collecting duct principal cells, and that morphologically identical OAPs present in lens fiber cell plasma membranes contain the protein MIP 26. Similar OAPs have also been detected on plasma membranes of other cell types including gastric parietal cells, astroglial cells and skeletal muscle fibers. By indirect immunofluorescence, western blotting and northern blotting, MIP 26 was found only in lens fibers. In addition, functional studies on reconstituted and oocyte-expressed MIP 26 excluded the possibility that MIP 26 might be a basolateral water channel in the kidney. However, a polyclonal antibody raised against skeletal muscle sarcolemmal vesicles, which are enriched in OAPs, produced an intense staining of principal cell basolateral plasma membranes in kidney collecting duct and immuno-precipitated a 28 kDa protein from kidney papilla. The immunoprecipitated protein from papilla was not recognized by <b>anti-CHIP</b> 28 or anti-MIP 26 antibodies, indicating that principal cell basolateral membranes contain a novel member of the CHIP/MIP family. Because this antibody also stained brain astrocyte end feet, which are enriched in OAPs, {{it is possible that the}} 28 kDa protein is related to these structures. We conclude that OAPs probably contain related but distinct proteins that may have different membrane channel functions in different cell types...|$|E
40|$|Aquaporin-CHIP is a 28 kD channel forming {{integral}} membrane protein. It {{acts as an}} osmotically driven, water-selective pore. The {{presence of}} aquaporin-CHIP has been demonstrated in the proximal tubule in the kidney and in the pleura, {{as well as in}} other tissues. During peritoneal dialysis a dissociation between the transport of water and sodium using hyperosmolar solutions has been reported, suggesting the presence of ultrasmall pores. Water channels, like aquaporin-CHIP, could be the morphological equivalent of these pores. We investigated the possible presence of aquaporin-CHIP in cryo-sections of peritoneal tissue using affinity purified human <b>anti-CHIP</b> IgC (P. Agre, Baltimore, MD). Peritoneal biopsies (omenta) were obtained at catheter insertion in 2 uremic patients with end-stage renal disease, and at catheter reimplantation of 1 patient treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for two years. Peritoneal tissue obtained at autopsy from 1 patient who had been on CAPD for four years, but in whom CAPD had been discontinued for five months, was also studied. Aquaporin-CHIP antiserum specific staining was found in the endothelial cells of the peritoneal capillaries in all patients. No obvious difference in the intensity of staining was seen between uremic and CAPD patients. This demonstration of aquaporin-CHIP in human peritoneal endothelial cells supports the hypothesis of the existence of ultrasmall pores within the peritoneal membrane. These water channels facilitate the transcellular transport of water, induced by an osmotic gradient, in the absence of sodium transport. It may be the explanation for the dissociation of water and sodium transport that occurs during hyperosmolar solutions. Aquaporin-CHIP is present in human peritoneal endothelial cells in both uremic and CAPD patients. Aquaporin-CHIP may be the morphological equivalent of the ultrasmall pores within the peritoneal membran...|$|E
