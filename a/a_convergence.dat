Water temperatures on Catarina's path ranged from 24 to 25°C, slightly less than the 26.5°C temperature of a normal tropical cyclone, but sufficient for a storm of baroclinic origin.|$|E

Mitre, for example, referred to The Representation of the Landowners (an 1809 economic report by Mariano Moreno) and the role of the merchants to support the view that the May Revolution intended to obtain free trade and economic integration with Europe; right-wing revisionists center around Saavedra and the social customs of the time to describe the revolution under conservative principles; and left-wing revisionists use the example of Moreno, Castelli and the rioters led by French and Beruti to describe it as a radical revolution.|$|E
5|$|A system {{developed}} within <b>a</b> <b>convergence</b> zone on January20 {{near the}} boundary between the South-West Indian Ocean and the Australia region. Its circulation became better defined, and MFR initiated advisories on January22. With a ridge to the south, it drifted to the southeast, approaching 90°E, but turning to the southwest before crossing over. On January23, the system intensified into a tropical depression. Slowly intensifying, the depression became Tropical Storm Eddy on January24. That day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 11S, and it turned toward the south. After having experienced moderate wind shear, Eddy entered an area of more favorable conditions, and its convection gradually organized. Early on January26, MFR upgraded it to a tropical cyclone, later estimating peak winds of 130km/h (80mph). After that time, increasing wind shear weakened Eddy to a tropical storm, causing it to curve to the west. By January28, the circulation was exposed from the convection, and Eddy weakened to a tropical depression. It turned to the southwest the next day, and dissipated fully on January30.|$|E
5|$|Between 1928 {{until his}} death, al-Qassam {{served as the}} {{president}} of the Young Men's Muslim Association (YMMA) in Haifa. While he focused his activism with the lower classes, his position in the YMMA afforded him access with the middle and educated classes of the city who were attracted to Hizb al-Istiqlal (Independence Party), an Arab nationalist political party. In particular, he developed a strong relationship with leading local party member Rashid al-Hajj Ibrahim, the previous president of the Haifa YMMA. A wide ideological gap between the secularist al-Istiqlal and al-Qassam was bridged by <b>a</b> <b>convergence</b> in the view that the struggle against Zionist expansion in Palestine was inseparable from active opposition to British rule. This view separated al-Qassam and al-Istiqlal from the mainstream political forces in Palestine at the time. While men from al-Istiqlal and the YMMA generally refrained from joining al-Qassam's cause, his association with them helped protect him from political figures who opposed his activism. His activities were also financed by several well-off businessmen associated with al-Istiqlal due to his spreading reputation.|$|E

5|$|On January 30, the poorly {{organised}} Tropical Disturbance 08F developed within <b>a</b> <b>convergence</b> zone about 325km (200mi) to {{the northeast}} of Apia on the Samoan island of Upolu. Over {{the next few days}} the system remained weak and poorly organized, and was classified as a tropical depression during February 5. The depression then moved westwards, before dissipating on February 9. Tropical Disturbance 10F developed on February 15, about 170km (105mi) {{to the north of the}} Fijian Dependency of Rotuma Island. The system was poorly defined and disorganised, while convection surrounding the system was mostly confined to the southern and eastern flanks of the low level circulation. Over the next few days the disturbance remained weak and was last noted during February 21, while nestled within the Solomon Islands. On March 6, Tropical Depression 11F developed under an upper trough of low pressure about 220km (140mi) {{to the northeast}} of Nadi, Fiji. Convection surrounding the depression was displaced to the north of the low level circulation center. The depression remained weak over the next couple of days, and was last noted during March 8. A fairly disorganized tropical disturbance developed during April 6, within a monsoonal convergence zone, about 236km (145mi) to the northeast of Port Vila, Vanuatu. It was initially located within an area of weak vertical windshear, but was expected to move into an area of stronger vertical windshear over the following 24hours and gradually become extratropical. During the next day, as the disturbance moved southwards, it was assigned the designation 14F, before it was dropped by RSMC Nadi during April 8, as convection surrounding the system became sheared and displaced. On April 13, Tropical Disturbance 15F developed within a monsoon trough, about 355km (220mi) to the southeast of Apia, Samoa. The system moved towards the south, with convection surrounding it poorly organised, and displaced to the north of the depression's low level circulation centre. The depression was then last noted, during the next day as Tropical Depression 16F developed into Tropical Cyclone Fili.|$|E
