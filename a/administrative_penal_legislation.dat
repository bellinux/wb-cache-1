This article unifies the {{ways of looking at}} the penal justice system in its wholeness and gives different perspectives to analyze it. Different parts of penal justice system raise to us important questions so to have a view of all parts of it, even those hidden, we need to see it from different perspectives. Penal justice system might be seen from different perspectives: its structure, police role, penal decisions phase, common policies of crime control of different institutions or penal procedures foreseen in the <b>penal</b> <b>legislation.</b> To understand <b>penal</b> justice system we need to be familiar with <b>penal</b> <b>legislation,</b> institutional practices but also to know the so-called “system models ” and management styles which are some of more suggested perspectives to be used by social sciences professionals.

40|$|This work {{attempt to}} trace the {{development}} of criminal law in Jamaica from 1655 when the English captured the Island, up to 1900. In tracing this development emphasis is placed more on legislative enactments and their policies than on judicial decisions, for {{it was in the}} field of <b>penal</b> <b>legislation</b> the Jamaican law tended to differ from English law. In chapter 1, the introduction of English law into the Island is outline, and a theory as to Jamaica's status is proposed. In Chapters 2 and 3 the background in which the <b>penal</b> <b>legislation</b> was enacted and administered in the 18 th and 19 th centuries is related. This necessitates an examination of the inhabitants, the legislators, the judiciary and the legal institutions. In Chapters 4 and 5 the <b>penal</b> <b>legislation</b> relating to slaves is discussed. The various legislative devices aimed at preventing rebellions and at protecting the slave owners' property are related. In Chapters 6, 7 and 8 the laws to protect the State, Persons and Property respectively are outlined. In Chapter 9, four problems of particular importance to Jamaica are examined. These problems are Piracy, Obeah, Praedial larceny and Vagrancy. In Chapter 10 the attempt to codify the criminal law is related. Reasons for the failure at codification are suggested. In Chapter 11 a brief look is taken at certain trends in <b>penal</b> <b>legislation</b> in the 20 th century. In Chapter 12, conclusions are drawn on the data provided in the preceding Chapters and certain proposals relative to the criminal law of Jamaica are put forward...|$|R
40|$|The {{most urgent}} {{problems}} of the <b>penal</b> <b>legislation</b> application are stated: social and economic support of post-penitentiary adaptation; lack of legal status of the RF subject in the penitentiary legal relations; direct dependence of many rights and legitimate interests of convicts upon judicial and administrative discretion; absence of a mechanism of implementing penal norms and subordinate normative legal acts, monitoring their implementation. The provisions of the RF Penal Code, contradicting the view established in the penal law theory regarding the penitentiary legal relations termination {{after the release of}} convict from further punishment, are revealed. The main technical and legal defects of the <b>penal</b> <b>legislation</b> in the inter-branch and interdisciplinary spheres are called (goals and objectives of the penal law are defined, goals and objectives of the punishment execution aren’t; principles of guilt and justice are fixed in the Criminal Code, but aren’t fixed in the Penal Code; incomparability of the guarantees of exercising the right to qualified legal assistance by ordinary citizens and convicts, etc.). The problem of the substitution of legislator by penal agency in regulating convicts’ rights and legitimate interests is stated. The provisions to be implemented in new <b>penal</b> <b>legislation</b> are expressed: 1) punishment in form of imprisonment should be in the very fact of isolation from society, otherwise the convict’s legal status shouldn’t differ from other citizens; 2) the list of prohibitions and restrictions for prisoners should be determined at the legislative level; 3) <b>penal</b> <b>legislation</b> should be exempt from evaluation terms and norms-exceptions, regarding convicts rights’ restrictions...|$|R
