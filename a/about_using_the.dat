5|$|Instead, Metternich stayed six months, entrusting {{his office}} in Vienna to his father. He set <b>about</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> marriage, and flattery, to renegotiate the terms set out at Schönbrunn. The {{concessions}} he won were trivial, however: a few trading rights, delay in the payment of the war indemnity, restitution of some estates belonging to Germans in the Austrian service, including the Metternich family's, and the lifting of a 150,000 man limit on the Austrian army. The last was particularly welcomed {{as a sign of}} increased Austrian independence, although Austria could no longer afford an army greater than the limit prescribed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the initial}} search {{failed to find}} any links to the Soviet Union, the CIA decided to extend the operation, and on 4 August a much larger team was deployed, with members from many {{government}} departments, including the State Department and the USIA. The task force was given the cover name Social Research Group. To avoid confrontation with Guatemalan nationalists, the CIA opted to leave the documents in Guatemalan possession, instead funding {{the creation of a}} Guatemalan intelligence agency that would try to dismantle the communist organizations. Thus the National Committee of Defense Against Communism (Comité de Defensa Nacional Contra el Comunismo) was created on 20 July, and granted a great deal of power over military and police functions. The personnel of the new agency were also put to work analyzing the same documents. The document-processing phase of the operation was terminated on 28 September 1954, having examined 500,000 documents. There was tension between the different U.S. government agencies <b>about</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> information; the CIA wished to use it to subvert communists, the USIA for propaganda. The CIA's leadership of the operation allowed it to retain control over any documents deemed necessary for clandestine operations. A consequence of PBHISTORY was the opening of a CIA file on Argentine communist Ernesto Che Guevara.|$|E
5|$|Seeking a {{customer}} for Photophone, in late 1927 David Sarnoff, then {{general manager of}} RCA, approached Joseph P. Kennedy <b>about</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> system for Kennedy's modest-sized studio, Film Booking Offices of America (FBO). Negotiations resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO—Sarnoff had apparently already conceived of {{a plan for the}} company to attain a central position in the film industry, maximizing Photophone revenue. Next on the agenda was securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading Hollywood production companies owned. Kennedy began investigating the possibility of such a purchase. Around that time, the large Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) circuit of theaters, built around the then-fading medium of live vaudeville, was attempting a transition to the movie business. In mid-1927, the filmmaking operations of Pathé Exchange and Cecil B. De Mille's Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC) had united under KAO's control. Early in 1928, KAO general manager John J. Murdock, who had assumed the presidency of Pathé, turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille's company, PDC. This was the relationship Sarnoff and Kennedy sought.|$|E

5|$|Troika {{wanted to}} make a 3D game, but was {{uncertain}} whether to build a new game engine or license an existing one and whether to use first- or third-person. At that time, the Source game engine was being built by Valve Corporation. Valve employee Scott Lynch approached Troika <b>about</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> engine, {{and it was the first}} external team to use it. Troika chose Source for its facial animation and lip-synching system, since it wanted players to speak to the characters face-to-face. Since the engine was in development with Bloodlines and Valve's own Half-Life 2, Troika was working with unfamiliar code and tools, forcing it to write its own code to compensate for the unfinished engine, and with only a single source for technical support. Troika developed a lighting system to create distinctive, moody illumination for the nighttime setting, a particle system for the special effects accompanying the vampire Disciplines, and a cloth system for clothing flow. Source lacked its later artificial intelligence (AI) coding, and Troika's code worked poorly with the Source engine.|$|E

After gaining planning permission from Somerset County Council, and approval of a drainage plan from the Environment Agency (conditions of which stipulate that the site must be fully reverted to meadow pasture at the termination of ballast recycling operations) the WSRA came to an agreement with NR to utilise spent ballast and rail from their track renewals programme. NR maintenance trains occasionally run from Fairwater Yard to Norton Fitzwarren to drop off spent materials at the site. A commercial operator sorts the ballast under contract to the WSRA.|$|E
25|$|Merida and Belle later stumble upon a witch's home, {{where they}} sneak inside {{to use a}} {{cauldron}} to do a locator spell, which conjures up a futuristic vision of a Southern moor where three men are vying for Merida's hand in marriage, followed by her three brothers brought in by their captors who remove the bags off their heads. Unfortunately, the United Clans also plan to kills Merida's brothers and take DunBroch from Merida. Belle tells Merida its time to change fate, so Belle reads the scroll. As Belle watches Merida practices her archery skills, she's just finished up creating the potion, which will turn Merida into a bear so she can save her brothers. Belle is skeptical <b>about</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> spell to change fate, but Merida says otherwise. As they reach the United Clans, Merida threatens {{to take them out}} but as she drinks the potion, Belle told her it wasn't the actual potion, then tells Merida that she should have faith in her own fate without magic. When the United Clans' archers aim their arrows at her brothers, Merida showed them who was in charge by aiming her arrows at the targets and takes them out. The clans then bow down to Merida to acknowledge her as the Queen of DunBroch. With that out of the way, Merida let Belle return to Camelot to join the others.|$|E
