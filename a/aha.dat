5|$|By the mid-1860s a deep rift had {{developed}} between Irataba, who was proactive in cooperating with white settlers, and Homoseh quahote, who passively tolerated {{but did not}} approve of white encroachment on Mohave lands. Irataba was <b>Aha</b> macave yaltanack of the Mohave from 1861 to 1866, but from 1867 to 1869 opinions differ, and by 1870 US government correspondence suggests that Homoseh quahote had succeeded him {{as leader of the}} Fort Mohave group.|$|E

5|$|Du Bois was {{the first}} African American invited by the American Historical Association (<b>AHA)</b> to present a paper at their annual conference. He read his paper, Reconstruction and Its Benefits, to an astounded {{audience}} at the AHA's December 1909 conference. The paper went against the mainstream historical view, promoted by the Dunning School of scholars at Columbia University, that Reconstruction was a disaster, caused by the ineptitude and sloth of blacks. To the contrary, Du Bois asserted that the brief period of African-American leadership in the South accomplished three important goals: democracy, free public schools, and new social welfare legislation. He asserted {{that it was the}} federal government's failure to manage the Freedmen's Bureau, to distribute land, and to establish an educational system, that doomed African-American prospects in the South. When Du Bois submitted the paper for publication a few months later in the American Historical Review, he asked that the word Negro be capitalized. The editor, J. Franklin Jameson, refused, and published the paper without the capitalization. The paper was mostly ignored by white historians. Du Bois later developed his paper as his ground-breaking 1935 book, Black Reconstruction, which marshaled extensive facts to support his assertions. The <b>AHA</b> did not invite another African-American speaker until 1940.|$|E

5|$|Against Irataba's advice, in 1858 Mohave warriors {{attacked}} the first emigrant wagon train to use Beale's Wagon Road through Mohave country. As a result, the U.S. War Department sent a detachment under Colonel William Hoffman to pacify the tribe. Following {{a series of}} confrontations known as the Mohave War, Hoffman succeeded in dominating the natives, and demanded that they allow the passage of settlers through their territory. To ensure compliance, Fort Mohave was constructed {{near the site of}} the battle in April 1859. Hoffman also imprisoned several Mohave leaders. Having been an advocate for friendly relations with the whites, Irataba became the nation's <b>Aha</b> macave yaltanack, an elected, as opposed to hereditary, leader.|$|E

He competed for the Memorial Cup, awarded to the Canadian junior hockey champions that year, playing in two games and {{surrendering}} 11 goals, a respectable amount in that era. After spending the 1920–21 season playing for Calgary Alberta Grain, Thompson played three seasons in Bellevue, Alberta. In the 1924–25 season, he joined the Duluth Hornets, playing 40 games, recording a shutout in 11 of them. The following season, Thompson joined the Minneapolis Millers of the American Hockey Association (<b>AHA).</b> In his three seasons with the Millers, he appeared in 118games, recording 33shutouts with a 1.37goals against average (average of goals surrendered in a span of sixty minutes).|$|E

40|$|Workforce {{shortages}} are {{forecast for}} speech-language pathology in Australia, {{and will have}} a more significant impact on rural and remote areas than on metropolitan areas. Allied health (AH) disciplines such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy {{address the problem of}} workforce shortages and growing clinical demand by employing allied health assistants (<b>AHAs)</b> to provide clinical and administrative support to AH professionals. Currently, speech-language pathologists (SLPs) don't work with discipline-specific allied health assistants in all states of Australia (e. g., New South Wales). This paper aims to provide insight into the perceptions of SLPs in one Australian state (NSW) regarding working with <b>AHAs.</b> Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight rural SLPs. Qualitative analysis indicated that participants perceived they had deficits in skills and knowledge required to work with <b>AHAs</b> and identified further training needs. Participants perceived the SLP role to be misunderstood and were concerned about poor consultation regarding the introduction of <b>AHAs</b> into the profession. Ambivalence was evident in overall perceptions of working with <b>AHAs,</b> and tasks performed. While previous research identified benefits of working with <b>AHAs,</b> results from this study suggest that significant professional, economic, and organizational issues need addressing before such a change should be implemented in speech-language pathology...|$|R
40|$|Abnormal {{decision}} making is a behavioral characteristic of drug addiction. Indeed, drug addicts prefer immediate rewards {{at the expense of}} future interests. Assessing the neurocognitive basis of decision-making related to drug dependence, combining event-related potential (ERP) analysis and source localization techniques, may provide new insights into understanding decision-making deficits in drug addicts and further guide withdrawal treatment. In this study, EEG was performed in 20 abstinent heroin addicts (<b>AHAs)</b> and 20 age-, education- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) while they participated in a simple two-choice gambling task (99 vs. 9). Our behavioral results showed that <b>AHAs</b> tend to select higher-risk choices compared with HCs (i. e., more “ 99 ” choices than “ 9 ”). ERP results showed that right hemisphere preponderance of stimulus-preceding negativity was disrupted in <b>AHAs,</b> but not in HCs. Feedback-related negativity of difference wave was higher in <b>AHAs</b> than HCs, with the P 300 amplitude associated with risk magnitude and valence. Using source localization that allows identification of abnormal brain activity in consequential cognitive stages, including the reward expectation and outcome evaluation stages, we found abnormalities in both behavioral and neural responses on gambling in <b>AHAs.</b> Taken together, our findings suggest <b>AHAs</b> have risk-prone tendency and dysfunction in adaptive {{decision making}}, since they continue to choose risky options even after accruing considerable negative scores, and fail to shift to a safer strategy to avoid risk. Such abnormal decision-making bias to risk and immediate reward seeking may be accompanied by abnormal reward expectation and evaluation in <b>AHAs,</b> which explains their high risk-seeking and impulsivity...|$|R

25|$|The UREX {{process is}} a PUREX process which has been {{modified}} to prevent the plutonium from being extracted.

The key is the addition of acetohydroxamic acid (<b>AHA)</b> to the extraction and scrub sections of the process. The addition of <b>AHA</b> greatly diminishes the extractability of plutonium and neptunium, providing somewhat greater proliferation resistance than with the plutonium extraction stage of the PUREX process.|$|E

50|$|Alpha hydroxy acids (<b>AHAs)</b> {{primarily}} {{in the form of}} lactic acid and glycolic acid are the most researched forms of <b>AHAs</b> because they have a molecular size that allows effective penetration into the top layers of skin.

It is believed that their benefit is in helping cell turnover rates and removing unhealthy or abnormal layers of superficial skin cells (exfoliation) where hyperpigmented cells can accumulate. However, other research has shown that lactic and glycolic acids can indeed inhibit melanin production separate from their actions as an exfoliant on skin.|$|R
