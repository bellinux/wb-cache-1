It was completely counter to the shellacked, flashy aesthetic of the 1980s in every way.

2500|$|In Greek myths, {{dolphins}} {{were seen}} invariably as helpers of humankind. Dolphins {{also seem to}} have been important to the Minoans, judging by artistic evidence from the ruined palace at Knossos. During the 2009 excavations of a major Mycenaean city at Iklaina, a striking fragment of a wall-paintings came to light, depicting a ship with three human figures and dolphins. Dolphins are common in Greek mythology, and many coins from ancient Greece have been found which feature a man, <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> deity riding {{on the back of a}} dolphin. The Ancient Greeks welcomed dolphins; spotting dolphins riding in a ship's wake was considered a good omen. [...] In both ancient and later art, Cupid is often shown riding a dolphin. A dolphin rescued the poet Arion from drowning and carried him safe to land, at Cape Matapan, a promontory forming the southernmost point of the Peloponnesus. There was a temple to Poseidon and a statue of Arion riding the dolphin.|$|E

So I cooked, trapped, freighted, wrangled dudes, trained horses, lambed sheep - just anything there was to do. I learned to do lots of things, but some of the things aren't of much use to me now - for example, how to put a six- or eight-horse team around a sharp bend. But some are real useful.

2500|$|Scharnhorst {{writes that}} Alger [...] "exercised a certain {{discretion}} in discussing his probable homosexuality" [...] and {{was known to}} have mentioned his sexuality only once after the Brewster incident. In 1870 the elder Henry James wrote that Alger [...] "talks freely about his own late insanity—which he in fact appears to enjoy as a subject of conversation". Although Alger was willing to speak to James, his sexuality was a closely guarded secret. According to Scharnhorst, Alger made veiled references to homosexuality in his boys' books, and these references, Scharnhorst speculates, indicate Alger was [...] "insecure with his sexual orientation". Alger wrote, for example, {{that it was difficult}} to distinguish whether Tattered Tom was <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> girl and in other instances he introduces foppish, effeminate, lisping [...] "stereotypical homosexuals" [...] who are treated with scorn and pity by others. In Silas Snobden's Office Boy, a kidnapped boy disguised as a girl is threatened with being sent to the [...] "insane asylum" [...] if he should reveal his actual sex. Scharnhorst believes Alger's desire to atone for his [...] "secret sin" [...] may have [...] "spurred him to identify his own charitable acts of writing didactic books for boys with the acts of the charitable patrons in his books who wish to atone for a secret sin in their past by aiding the hero". Scharnhorst points out that the patron in Try and Trust, for example, conceals a [...] "sad secret" [...] from which he is redeemed only after saving the hero's life.|$|E

2500|$|The {{disparity}} in the gender ratio at birth increases dramatically {{after the first}} birth, for which the ratios remained steadily within the natural baseline over the 20 year interval between 1980 and 1999. Thus, {{a large majority of}} couples appear to accept the outcome of the first pregnancy, whether it is <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> girl. If the first child is a girl, and they are able to have a second child, then a couple may take extraordinary steps to assure that the second child is a boy. If a couple already has two or more boys, the sex ratio of higher parity births swings decidedly in a feminine direction. This demographic evidence indicates that while families highly value having male offspring, a secondary norm of having a girl or having some balance in the sexes of children often comes into play. [...] reported a study based on the 1990 census in which they found sex ratios of just 65 or 70 boys per 100 girls for births in families that already had two or more boys. [...] A study by [...] found a similar pattern among both Han and non-Han nationalities in Xinjiang Province: a strong preference for girls in high parity births in families that had already borne two or more boys. [...] This tendency to favour girls in high parity births to couples who had already borne sons was later also noted by Coale and Banister, who suggested as well that once a couple had achieved its goal for the number of males, it was also much {{more likely to engage in}} [...] "stopping behavior", i.e., to stop having more children.|$|E
