5|$|Ski wax {{enhances the}} ability of <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} work on implosion, Kistiakowsky contributed to skiing in Los Alamos by using rings of {{explosives}} to fell trees for <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> slope— leading {{to the establishment of}} Sawyer's Hill Ski Tow Association. He divorced Hildegard in 1942 and married Irma E. Shuler in 1945. They were divorced in 1962, and he married Elaine Mahoney.|$|E

5|$|Papoose Peak Jumps was <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> jumping hill {{located at}} Squaw Valley Ski Resort in the US state of California. The hill {{consisted}} of three jumps, with K-points of 80, 60 and 40 meters, respectively. Constructed upon the hill-side of Little Papoose Peak, it was built for the 1960 Winter Olympics; the 80-meter hill hosted the ski jumping event and the 60-meter hill the Nordic combined event. The jump was designed by Heini Klopfer and opened in 1958. After the Olympics the venue saw little use; it was renovated for the 1976 US National Ski Jumping Championships, but has since fallen into disrepair and demolished {{to make room for}} <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> lift.|$|E
5|$|Stig Inge Bjørnebye {{was born}} in Elverum, the son of skier Jo Inge Bjørnebye, who competed in the 1968 and 1972 Winter Olympics. As a child, Bjørnebye {{exhibited}} an interest in emulating his father by becoming <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> jumper.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} was made despite that no political parties in Oslo supported constructing <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> flying hill and that neither the municipality nor the state were willing to issue grants. There were also concerns from environmental groups as Rødkleiva lies within a protected area. Two days after the convention decision, Vikersundbakken applied to host a World Cup event in 2007. At a public meeting in August, politicians from all parties confirmed {{that they would not}} support Rødkleiva and City Council Chair Erling Lae declared the meeting as a funeral for the project. Yet the federation established a committee, led by Seeberg, to explore ways the venue could be financed and built. In December 2006, Steinar Johannessen stated that he and the federation had given up having <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> jumping hill at Rødkleiva.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>ski</b> flying event {{consists}} of several preliminary stages, {{culminating in a}} competition to decide a winner and subsequent order. Within an event there are up to three competitions – individual, and sometimes team – all taking place on separate days. These competitions are contested somewhat differently depending on whether an event is staged {{as part of the}} Ski Flying World Championships or Ski Flying World Cup. In both events, a 'training' round takes place on the opening day, as well as a 'trial' round before each competition; these non-scoring rounds are essentially practice or warm-up sessions, and athlete participation is optional.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Revelstoke, Nelsen {{was instrumental in}} the establishment of Revelstoke Ski Club and the Big Hill located within Mount Revelstoke National Park. In 1927, he helped establish <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> jump in Grouse Mountain in North Vancouver. After his accident, he started working to establish Field Ski Club in Field, British Columbia, where he spent time between trains. He promoted a strict adherence to the amateur code, and stated that debates regarding professionalism were disruptive for the United States National Ski Association.|$|E

He met a New Age spiritual advisor there, and on her advice, he {{followed}} her to Taos, New Mexico. There, {{he lived in a}} hostel and worked at <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> resort. Three months later, he moved to California to find more spiritual gurus. Gattis also moved to Wyoming, where he worked at Yellowstone National Park.|$|E
5|$|Alpha Flight's Northstar was {{the first}} major gay {{character}} in the Marvel universe and remains the most famous gay character in mainstream comics. Created by Marvel Comics in 1979 {{as a member of the}} original Alpha Flight superhero team, Northstar's sexual identity was hinted at early in his history, in 1983 in issues 7 and 8 of Alpha Flight, but not openly stated; his apparent lack of interest in women was chalked up to his obsessive drive to win as <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> champion. The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992's Alpha Flight issue 106 and his outing made national headlines.|$|E
5|$|At that time, Aspen was a faded {{mining town}} whose {{population}} had dwindled {{to fewer than}} a thousand. Later in the decade the first efforts to develop <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> resort began. They continued after World War II, and in the later decades of the 20th century the city began to grow again. Other than paving the road, CDOT was unable to undertake any significant improvements to the highway corridor due to its projects elsewhere {{in the state and}} the requirement to coordinate efforts with the Forest Service, which owns most of the damaged land.|$|E

The two spend the evening in conversation over a few drinks at Sissener's house, and Odd is led to realisations about his own life. It emerges that his mothera free-spirited womanwas <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> jumper, but Odd himself never {{had the courage to}} try the sport. He now feels as if he has let her down, by never having the courage to seize the day and try new things.|$|E
5|$|Nelsen {{worked for}} the Canadian Pacific Railway, and moved to North Vancouver, British Columbia, where he raised a family. Nelsen lost his hand in a hunting {{accident}} in 1933, {{and was forced to}} retire as <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> jumper. He continued as an organizer, and was among other things president of the Western Canada Amateur Ski Association and later vice-president of the Canadian Amateur Ski Association. In 1948, after Big Hill had been expanded, it was renamed Nels Nelsen Hill. Nelsen was inscribed in the U.S. National Ski Hall of Fame in 1971 and the Canadian Ski Hall of Fame in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 Winter Olympic Games and Paralympic Games {{were held}} in Vancouver and Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. The Olympics ran from February 12 to February 28, 2010, and the Paralympics from March 12 to March 21, during which nine {{competition}} venues were used, spread across Vancouver, Whistler, and the neighbouring areas of West Vancouver and Richmond. The majority of ice sport events {{were held in}} Vancouver, while Whistler, which normally serves as <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> resort, hosted the snow events. Six non-competition venues, three each in Vancouver and Whistler, provided athlete housing, space for media, and locations for ceremonies associated with the Games.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} was first identified by Knute Hansen, <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> jumper {{who felt that}} a location in Mount McRae in Lakehead would be ideal for <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> jumping hill. He and Thor Hansen built the first jumps, which were opened in 1963 and named Lille Norway Ski Area. In 1969, after the Hansens had fallen into financial difficulties, the venue was sold and renamed Mt. Norway Ski Area. Additional land for the complex was also leased, and the provincial government provided funding to construct the main twin hill. Construction of the 70meter and 90meter (current K-90 and K-120) hills was completed in 1974. The following year, the venue hosted its first Canadian Ski Jumping Championships. Three years later, the venue was again sold, this time being named Sundance Northwest Resort. In 1981, the Provincial Government of Ontario started redeveloping the site to transform it into a national training center. In 1985, the Ontario Ministry of Tourism and Recreation bought the site. In the course of five years, they built a K-64 hill, as well as Little Thunder, which consisted of K-10, K-20 and K-37 hills. The two largest of these were equipped with porcelain in-runs and plastic landing slopes, allowing for their use during summer.|$|E
5|$|The son of {{a textile}} {{machinery}} manufacturer, Mertz studied patent law at the University of Bern, and science at the University of Lausanne, specialising in glacier and mountain formations. While a student, Mertz became active as a skier, competing in national competitions, and as a mountaineer, climbing many of the highest peaks in the Alps. In early 1911, Mertz was hired by geologist and explorer Douglas Mawson for his Australasian Antarctic Expedition. He was initially employed as <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> instructor, but in Antarctica Mertz instead joined Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis {{in the care of}} the expedition's Greenland Huskies.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{proposed}} ski flying hills, most of which never reached the construction stage. Two were planned in Finland, in Kemijärvi and Ylitornio, but neither projects were realized after their inception in 2007. In Norway, prior to the renovation of Vikersund, there were serious talks about constructing a new ski flying hill at Rødkleiva in Oslo. The most recent proposal has come from China, together with German architects Graft, who are in the development stages of <b>a</b> <b>ski</b> jumping and flying hill complex at the Wangtiane ski resort in the Changbai Mountains.|$|E
