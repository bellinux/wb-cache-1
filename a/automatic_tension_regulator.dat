Due to difficulties in handling {{only a limited number}} of surgeons manage to display sufficient levels of precision in Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) procedures. Prior works on robotic laser surgery demonstrated shorter learning curves and higher ablation precision, but unfortunately ignored the fact that most clinically relevant tasks are bi-manual by nature. Surgeons are also reluctant to use current commercial surgical robotic systems for complex laser tasks, indicating that the lack of haptic feedback prevents them from efficient and safe tissue handling in preparation of laser treatment.

An artificial test-setup that captures some essential features of bimanual laser surgery is described.

30|$|Based on the {{variation}} of tensile force during the start, stop {{and operation of}} belt conveyor, a tension technology and equipment of high accuracy and large tensioning stroke has been developed. It can quickly respond and automatically adjust tension and tensioning stroke with the tension variation of the belt conveyor. During normal operations, the tensile force is 0.9 – 1.1 times of the rated tensile force, during start and stop, the tensile force is 1.3 – 1.4 times of the rated tensile force, and during the shift of conveyor tail, the equipment can quickly respond and guarantee non-skid. The working principle is: based on the conveyor’s start-up and loading, with the feedback of tension sensor signal, the PLC controller and fuel tank can automatically adjust the output of tensile force to avoid slipping between belts and drive pulley, lower the safety factor selected for the belt, and ensure the normal operation of the belt conveyor.

Helical strips of dogs' gastric arteries were mounted for <b>automatic</b> <b>tension</b> recording. The strips contracted on exposure to norepinephrine; these contractions were inhibited by phenoxybenzamine. Electrical stimulation caused an increase in tension, which was abolished by tetrodotoxin and phenoxybenzamine. indicating that electrical stimulation causes contraction by liberation of norepinephrine. Acetylcholine did not alter basal tension; it caused relaxation during responses to electrical stimulation, but not during those to norepinephrine. The relaxation caused by acetylcholine was abolished by atropine. This indicates that acetylcholine inhibits adrenergic neurotransmission in the dog's gastric artery. When added during electrical stimulation, atropine caused an increase in tension. The same concentrations of atropine did not affect basal tension or the response to norepinephrine. Physostigmine depresses the response to electrical stimulation, but not that to norepinephrine. In the blood-perfused stomach of the intact dog, vagal stimulation depressed vasoconstrictions caused by sympathetic nerve stimulation more than comparable constrictor responses obtained with the infusion of norepinephrine.

Introduced {{at the behest}} of international donor agencies, regulators in India are intended, somewhat naively, to provide an apolitical space for decision making to assuage investor concerns over arbitrary administrative actions, and thereby stimulate private investment. In practice, regulators have had to negotiate a terrain over which the state has continued to exercise considerable control. Regulators have also been been shaped in their functioning by national and sub-national political traditions and by administrative and political practices. The result is a hybrid institutional form that combines politics as usual with intriguing new, and unanticipated, opportunities for political intervention. This paper will explore the origins of electricity regulation as a form of institutional isomorphism. It will then compare the regulatory experience in India 2 ̆ 7 s electricity sector across two Indian states to understand the implications of transplanting regulatory agencies in the global south.

Aglycon anthocyanidin forms, such as CY and DP, may be present in vivo after the first deglycosylation step occurring in the jejunum and in the liver. DP showed a major action compared to CY inducing a significant dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both protein and mRNA levels of ET- 1. CY and DP both increased the protein level of eNOS, but DP showed the major effect raising eNOS protein in a dose-dependent manner. To correlate the vasoprotective effect of CY and DP with their antioxidant activity, we analysed also the antioxidant effect of anthocyanidins both in vitro and in HUVECs.

The level of precision required in Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) represents a challenge for the limited number of surgeons that prove to master the technique. Prior works on robotic laser surgery demonstrated shorter learning curves and higher ablation precision, but unfortunately ignored the fact that most clinically relevant tasks are bi-manual by nature. However, current commercial surgical robotic systems are not recommended for complex laser tasks in favor of more conventional practices. Lack of haptic feedback remains as a main argument to refuse the benefits of robotics in surgery. In cases on which tissue handling is of special difficulty during preparation of laser treatment, efficiency and safety of the manipulation do not reach the levels of manual laparoscopy. This communication introduces recent work in the direction of bi-manual operation. A tissue that is targeted by the laser is precisely manipulated and tensioned by a robotic system.

Essential features of bimanual laser surgery are studied on an artificial test-setup.

30|$|The {{tensioning}} {{stress distribution}} of {{circular saw blade}} after roll tensioning was described by Szymani [2]. In the inner loop of the tensioned region, the tangential tensioning stress is compressive, and its value increases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to inside. In the exterior loop of the tensioned region, the tangential tensioning stress is tensile, and its value decreases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to outside. This distribution of tangential tensioning stress is not very ideal relatively. The tangential tensioning stresses of circular saw blades tensioned by three levels of hammering were measured by X-ray stress meter [3, 4]. The tangential tensioning stress outside hammer region increases with radius, which is an ideal distribution. This phenomenon indicates that the distribution of tangential tensioning stress produced by hammering is more reasonable than that produced by roll tensioning. However, hammer tensioning has its limitations because the hammer tensioning creates a very irregular surface and produce localized, non-axisymmetric stresses because the force and position of spots are controlled by workers and its reproducibility and controllability {{are very difficult to}} be mastered, and it depends heavily on the experience and skills of saw repairing workers. The precision of hammer tensioning is relatively poor. Multi-spot pressure tensioning process is one kind of tensioning methods and a quasi-static process. The fixed areas of circular saw blade are pressed by spherical or cylindrical surface during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. The force and position of spots are controlled precisely by automated machinery during the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. A cyclic symmetry stress distribution and appropriate macroscopic deformation can be obtained by the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. Therefore, a more ideal distribution of tangential tensioning stress is produced during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. This tensioning approach is conducive to the realization of the <b>automatic</b> <b>tensioning</b> operation, especially in the production of ultra-thin circular saw blades.|$|R

40|$|Since their inception, public {{lawyers and}} {{political}} scientists have fulminated {{at the lack}} of accountability of regulatory agencies. But, though it may surprise their critics, regulatory agencies do not {{go out of their way}} to be unaccountable. The difficulties of accountability, this article argues, lie in large part elsewhere: with the institutional position and accountability capacity of the accountors, and with the particular nature of the challenges that face them. The article focuses on developments in the roles of the four main accountors in the political domain in turn: the core executive, Parliament, the National Audit Office and consumer bodies, exploring their relationships both with the accountees (the regulators) and with other bodies which are calling those regulators to account. It examines their capacity to call regulators to account, and to meet the five core accountability challenges that face them: viz the scale and scope of the regulatory landscape; the number of organisations involved in any one regulatory domain, the complexity of their relationships and their propensity to blame-shift; the technical complexity and contestability of the regulatory task; the opacity of regulatory processes; and the willingness of the accountee to be called to account. These challenges produce deep-rooted tensions which are not easy to resolve, and create opportunities for blame-shifting which both accountors and accountees can, and do, seek to exploit. Moreover, the roles of accountors themselves are fluid, moving from accountor to participant to controller, bringing further complexity to the accountability relationship. However, it is the nature both of the relationship and the task of accountability that these tensions will exist, and it is right that they do, at least up to a point. For without those <b>tensions</b> both <b>regulators</b> and their accountors will become complacent, which will be to their detriment, as well as ours...|$|R

Average annual DOC fluxes of the 30 AETPLS were 4. 9 g C m(- 2) y(- 1) at 0. 4 m and 2. 4 g C m(- 2) y(- 1) at 1. 2 m depth. The average leachate DOC concentrations were 17 mg C L(- 1) (0. 4 m) and 9 mg C L(- 1) (1. 2 m). The DOC concentrations were unrelated to soil moisture content or average temperature and rarely dropped below 9 mg C L(- 1) (0. 4 m) and 5 mg C L(- 1) (1. 2 m). The variability in cumulative DOC fluxes among the plates was positively related to leachate volume and not to average DOC concentrations at both depths. This suggests that water fluxes are the main determinants of spatial variability in DOC fluxes. However, the largest DOC concentrations were inversely proportional to the mean water velocity between succeeding sampling periods, suggesting that the maximal net DOC mobilization rate in the topsoil is limited. Elevated DOC concentrations, up to 90 mg C L(- 1), were only observed at low water velocities, reducing the risks of DOC-facilitated transport of contaminants to groundwater.

40|$|Automatic {{control of}} high tension soil {{solution}} samplers (suction lysimeters) {{in response to}} the surrounding soil matric potential has been proposed as a new method to reduce the convergence and divergence fluxes around the lysimeters. It is important to evaluate the instruments’ performance with automatically regulated suction because the efficiency of the control and its effects on the flux volumes could vary with the surrounding soil matric potential. An <b>automatic</b> equilibrium <b>tension</b> lysimeter (AETL) system was developed composed of 16 small-area (572 cm 2) ceramic suction plates that were continuously kept in equilibrium by an automated control device. The automated control device consisted of a datalogger connected to electronic tensiometers and to an electric vacuum pump that was activated to regulate the ceramic plate suction. The system was evaluated by simulating its performance with the HYDRUS- 2 D finite-element model. The AETL system continuously kept the lysimeters’ suction in equilibrium with the surrounding soil when the soil water matric potential head ranged from 2306 to 0 cm H 2 O. Suction control was less effective during low drainage conditions (soil matric potential head less than 250 cm H 2 O), when it took more time to re-equilibrate the pressure heads. However analysis of the variability of drainage and model simulations showed that incorrect suction control in drier conditions had a limited effect on the collected volumes. Suction was much better controlled when drainage flux was high, allowing a correct estimate of drainage. Automatic control of suction plates is a valuable tool for estimating drainage fluxes. Fine control of suction is needed when drainage flux is high because even the slight overapplication of suction, which is typically done during field experiments to overcome porous plate resistance and ensure that a sample is collected, could produce marked overestimation of water drainage (. 30 %) ...|$|R

After a shift from high to low oxygen <b>tension,</b> the response <b>regulator</b> RegA enhances transcription of the puf and puc operon coding for the reaction center, light-harvesting complex I (LHI), and LHII proteins. Various regA mutant strains were analyzed in this study. In a RegA deficient strain, activation of puf and puc transcription is severely impaired which consequently leads to the synthesis of only a few photosynthetic complexes. Strains carrying a mutation in the helix-turn-helix domain of RegA or a mutation of the phosphorylation site, Asp 63, show a phenotype like the RegA deficient mutant, although the RegA(D 63 K) mutant protein showed the same DNA binding behavior as the wild type protein. In contrast, the puf and puc mRNAs still reach about 50 - 70 % of the wild type level after reduction of oxygen tension in strains which synthesize the C-terminal RegA activator domain only or a hybrid protein composed of the RegA activator and the FixJ receiver domain, while both mutant proteins are impaired in DNA binding. Our data suggest that phosphorylation is not required for DNA binding but rather plays a role for efficient initiation of transcription...|$|R
40|$|Extrinsic {{mechanical}} signals have been implicated as key regulators of {{mesenchymal stem cell}} (MSC) differentiation. It has been possible to test different hypotheses for mechano-regulated MSC differentiation by attempting to simulate regenerative events such as bone fracture repair, where repeatable spatial and temporal patterns of tissue differentiation occur. More recently, in vitro studies have identified other environmental cues such as substrate stiffness and oxygen <b>tension</b> as key <b>regulators</b> of MSC differentiation; however it remains unclear if and how such cues determine stem cell fate in vivo. As part of this study, a computational model was developed {{to test the hypothesis}} that substrate stiffness and oxygen tension regulate stem cell differentiation during fracture healing. Rather than assuming {{mechanical signals}} act directly on stem cells to determine their differentiation pathway, it is postulated that they act indirectly to regulate angiogenesis and hence partially determine the local oxygen environment within a regenerating tissue. Chondrogenesis of MSCs was hypothesized to occur in low oxygen regions, while in well vascularised regions of the regenerating tissue a soft local substrate was hypothesised to facilitate adipogenesis while a stiff substrate facilitated osteogenesis. Predictions from the model were compared to both experimental data and to predictions of a well established computational mechanobiological model where tissue differentiation is assumed to be regulated directly by the local mechanical environment. The model predicted all the major events of fracture repair, including cartilaginous bridging, endosteal an...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between Social Anxiety (SA) and problematic drinking has received mixed empirical support. Theory suggests implicit, automatically activated, alcohol cognitions {{are central to}} drinking risk. In the context of SA, the cognitions evoked {{in response to an}} anxious mood are relevant. The SA-alcohol use literature to date has not examined implicit cognition. Moreover, the influence of mood on drinking has been explored using performance-based mood manipulations, which may inhibit alcohol use for fear of impairing performance. The present study aimed to develop an ecologically valid socially-relevant mood manipulation and examine its effects on implicit alcohol cognitions and drinking outcomes. It was hypothesized that SA would influence the <b>automatic</b> activation of <b>tension</b> reduction alcohol cognitions and drinking behaviour, only for those in an anxious mood. Undergraduates (N = 132; 86 % women) completed self-reports of SA and alcohol use/problems, were randomly assigned to an anxious or control mood condition, completed an implicit task, and self-reported urge to drink. Results revealed that mood moderated the effect of SA on urge to drink. When in an anxious mood, those high in SA reported an elevated urge to drink for negative and positive reinforcement purposes. There was little support for the role of implicit alcohol cognition. The activation of implicit cognition in the lab was not associated with drinking status. While the role of implicit cognition in the SA-drinking risk pathway did not receive much support, the current study incorporated a socially-relevant lab-based mood manipulation that was effective in eliciting the urge to drink...|$|R
