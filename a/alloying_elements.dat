5|$|The {{carbon content}} of steel is between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight for plain ironcarbon alloys. These values vary {{depending}} on <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> such as manganese, chromium, nickel, iron, tungsten, carbon and so on. Basically, steel is an iron-carbon alloy that does not undergo eutectic reaction. In contrast, cast iron does undergo eutectic reaction. Too little carbon content leaves (pure) iron quite soft, ductile, and weak. Carbon contents {{higher than those of}} steel make an alloy, commonly called pig iron, that is brittle (not malleable). While iron alloyed with carbon is called carbon steel, alloy steel is steel to which other <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel. Common <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> include: manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, boron, titanium, vanadium, tungsten, cobalt, and niobium. Additional elements are also important in steel: phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, and traces of oxygen, nitrogen, and copper, that are most frequently considered undesirable.|$|E
5|$|Iron is {{the most}} widely used of all the metals, {{accounting}} for over 90% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools, automobiles, the hulls of large ships, and structural components for buildings. Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly combined with <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> to make steel.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{base metal}} is iron, which {{is able to}} take on two {{crystalline}} forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic (BCC) and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the <b>alloying</b> <b>elements,</b> primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one {{at the center of}} each of the six faces of the cube.|$|E
5000|$|In solid {{solution}} strengthening, a soluble <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> {{is added to}} the material desired to be strengthened, and together they form a “{{solid solution}}”. A solid solution can be thought of just as a [...] "normal" [...] liquid solution, e.g. salt in water, except it is solid. Depending {{on the size of the}} dissolved <b>alloying</b> <b>element's</b> ion compared to that of the matrix-metal, it is dissolved either substitutionally (large <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> substituting for an atom in the crystal) or interstitially (small <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> taking a place between atoms in the crystal lattice). In both cases, the size difference of the foreign elements make them act as sand grains in sandpaper, resisting dislocations that try to slip by, resulting in higher material strength. In solution hardening, the <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> does not precipitate from solution.|$|R
40|$|The {{actuator}} (1) has two single-piece segments (2, 3) {{that are}} adjustable along and/or over an actuatory axis (A). A pair of shape memory <b>alloy</b> <b>elements</b> (5, 7) is arranged between the segments {{and connected to}} the segments. The shape memory <b>alloy</b> <b>elements</b> are oppositely bent from each other. The segments are formed in same and/or identical shape such as polygon, box and/or tube shape. The segments are concentrically or coaxially arranged or arranged in a telescopic shape. The shape memory <b>alloy</b> <b>elements</b> are formed as a wire and/or band...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the aspects}} of modern {{material}} systems for high strength sintered steel parts {{is the presence of}} <b>alloy</b> <b>elements</b> with widely different oxygen affinity. Compared to the base iron, the “new” <b>alloy</b> <b>elements</b> Cr, Mn and Si form oxides with much higher stability. It is shown here that in case of powder mixes this leads to oxygen transfer from the base iron particles to the <b>alloy</b> <b>elements</b> during heating up to sintering temperature, i. e. metallothermic reduction of the iron surfaces. With prealloyed powders, the surface oxides, which are originally mostly iron oxide, are transformed into <b>alloy</b> <b>element</b> oxides during heating unless the iron oxides can be reduced at low temperature with H 2. In any case, the heterogeneity of the oxygen affinity is a parameter that has to be considered when defining alloy systems for sintered steels...|$|R
25|$|HY-80 {{is a low}} carbon, {{low alloy}} steel with nickel, {{chromium}} and molybdenum (Ni-Cr-Mo) as <b>alloying</b> <b>elements.</b> It has excellent weldability and notch toughness along with good ductility even in welded sections. Their strength and toughness develops during manufacture by a heat-treatment process of quenching and tempering.|$|E
25|$|The {{equivalent}} {{carbon content}} concept {{is used on}} ferrous materials, typically steel and cast iron, to determine various properties of the alloy when more than just carbon is used as an , which is typical. The idea is to convert the percentage of <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> other than carbon to the equivalent carbon percentage, because the iron-carbon phases are better understood than other iron-alloy phases. Most commonly this concept is used in welding, {{but it is also}} used when heat treating and casting cast iron.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Mesoamerican metal smiths produced particular alloys with the chief aim of exploiting the alloys’ emergent color properties, particularly the vivid gold tones produced through infusion of tin, and the silver shades that develop at high arsenic concentrations. Notably, certain artifacts from West Mexico contain tin or arsenic at concentrations as high as 23 weight percent, while concentrations of <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> at roughly 2 to 5 weight percent are typically adequate for augmented strength and mechanical utility.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{every piece}} of metal is an alloy of one type or another. Copper, aluminium, and other base metals are {{occasionally}} alloyed with beryllium, which is a highly toxic metal. When a metal like this is welded or cut, high concentrations of toxic beryllium fumes are released. Long-term exposure to beryllium may result in shortness of breath, chronic cough, and significant weight loss, accompanied by fatigue and general weakness. Other <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> such as arsenic, manganese, silver, and aluminium can cause sickness {{to those who are}} exposed.|$|E
25|$|The AWS {{states that}} for an {{equivalent}} carbon content above 0.40% {{there is a}} potential for cracking in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) on flame cut edges and welds. However, structural engineering standards rarely use CE, but rather limit the maximum percentage of certain <b>alloying</b> <b>elements.</b> This practice started before the CE concept existed, so just continues to be used. This has led to issues because certain high strength steels are now being used that have a CE higher than 0.50% that have brittle failures.|$|E
25|$|Russia {{holds the}} {{greatest}} reserves of mineral resources than {{any country in}} the world. Though they are abundant, they are in remote areas with extreme climates, making them expensive to mine. The country is the most abundant in mineral fuels. It may hold as much as half of the world's coal reserves and even larger reserves of petroleum. Deposits of coal are scattered throughout the region, but the largest are located in central and eastern Siberia. The most developed fields lie in western Siberia, in the northeastern European region, in the area around Moscow, and in the Urals. The major petroleum deposits are located in western Siberia and in the Volga-Urals. Smaller deposits are found throughout the country. Natural gas, a resource of which Russia holds around forty percent of the world's reserves, can be found along Siberia's Arctic coast, in the North Caucasus, and in northwestern Russia. Major iron-ore deposits are located south of Moscow, near the Ukrainian border in the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly; this area contains vast deposits of iron ore that have caused a deviation in the Earth's magnetic field. There are smaller deposits {{in other parts of the}} country. The Ural mountains hold small deposits of manganese. Nickel, tungsten, cobalt, molybdenum and other iron <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> occur in adequate quantities.|$|E

40|$|The <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> content {{present in}} the α-Zr matrix of Zr alloys, {{especially}} the concentration and distribution of the transition elements Fe, Cr, Ni is crucial to determining the alloy corrosion behavior. However, the levels of these elements in the Zr matrix are so low that they cannot be measured by traditional techniques.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reported}} the low activation martensitic steels {{which are being}} studied to develop the structural materials in fusion reactors. The steels were based on 9 Cr 1. 5 WVTa, but the effect of <b>alloy</b> <b>elements</b> was investigated by changing the amounts of <b>alloy</b> <b>elements</b> or adding other elements. The structure and properties of the steels were studied by tensile experiment, X-ray diffraction, SEM, TEM. Also the metallurgical process and heat treatment effect were discussed...|$|R
500|$|The {{carbon in}} typical steel alloys may {{contribute}} up to 2.14% of its weight. Varying {{the amount of}} carbon and many other <b>alloying</b> <b>elements,</b> as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel (either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases), slows the movement of those dislocations that make pure iron ductile, and thus controls and enhances its qualities. [...] These qualities include such things as the hardness, quenching behavior, need for annealing, tempering behavior, yield strength, and tensile strength of the resulting steel. The increase in steel's strength compared to pure iron is only possible by reducing iron's ductility.|$|E
500|$|The {{choice of}} {{electrode}} for SMAW {{depends on a}} number of factors, including the weld material, welding position and the desired weld properties. The electrode is coated in a metal mixture called flux, which gives off gases as it decomposes to prevent weld contamination, introduces deoxidizers to purify the weld, causes weld-protecting slag to form, improves the arc stability, and provides <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> to improve the weld quality. Electrodes can be divided into three groupsthose designed to melt quickly are called [...] "fast-fill" [...] electrodes, those designed to solidify quickly are called [...] "fast-freeze" [...] electrodes, and intermediate electrodes go by the name [...] "fill-freeze" [...] or [...] "fast-follow" [...] electrodes. Fast-fill electrodes are designed to melt quickly so that the welding speed can be maximized, while fast-freeze electrodes supply filler metal that solidifies quickly, making welding in a variety of positions possible by preventing the weld pool from shifting significantly before solidifying.|$|E
2500|$|In welding, {{equivalent}} {{carbon content}} (C.E) {{is used to}} understand how the different <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> affect hardness of the steel being welded. This is then directly related to hydrogen-induced cold cracking, which is the most common weld defect for steel, thus it is most commonly used to determine weldability. Higher concentrations of carbon and other <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> such as manganese, chromium, silicon, molybdenum, vanadium, copper, and nickel tend to increase hardness and decrease weldability. Each of these elements tends to influence the hardness and weldability of the steel to different magnitudes, however, making a method of comparison necessary to judge the difference in hardness between two alloys made of different <b>alloying</b> <b>elements.</b> There are two commonly used formulas for calculating the equivalent carbon content. One is from the American Welding Society (AWS) and recommended for structural steels and the other is the formula based on the International Institute of Welding (IIW).|$|E
40|$|A comprehensive, {{transient}} {{three-dimensional model}} of a single-pass laser surface alloying process has been developed and {{used to examine the}} heat, momentum and species transport phenomena. A numerical study is performed in a co-ordinate system moving with the laser at a constant scanning speed. In this model a fixed grid enthalpy-porosity approach is used, which predicts the evolutionary pool development. In this model two extreme cases of <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> and base metal combinations are considered based on their relative melting points. One extreme case is for an <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> with its melting point much lower than that of the base metal. In this case the <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> melts almost instantaneously. Hence it is assumed that the <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> introduced on the melt pool surface is in the molten state. Thus, while solving the species conservation equation a species flux condition is used on the entire melt pool surface. This case is analysed for aluminium <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> on iron base metal. The final species distribution in the melt pool {{as well as in the}} solidified alloy is predicted. The other extreme case is studied for an <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> with its melting point relatively higher than that of the base metal. In this case all the <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> particles on the melt pool surface will not melt. Only those particles which fall in the region on the melt pool surface where the local temperature is higher than the melting point of the <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> will melt. The particles which fall away from this region are advected into the melt pool, due to a strong Marangoni convection on the melt pool surface. If a particle is advected into the inner region in the melt pool (where the temperature is higher than its melting point), it starts melting and thus the molten species mass gets distributed. Hence, the species flux condition at the entire surface of the melt pool is not valid. The particles are tracked in the melt pool by assuming the alloying particles to be spherical in shape and moving without any relative velocity with the surrounding fluid. Simultaneously, the temperature field inside the spherical particle is solved by assuming its surface temperature to be the local temperature in the melt pool. The amount of particle mass that fuses as it passes through a particular control volume is noted. The same procedure is repeated for a large number of particles initiated at various locations on the pool surface, and a statistical distribution of the species mass source in the entire pool is obtained. This species mass source distribution is then used to solve the species conservation equation. Nickel <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> on aluminium base metal is used to illustrate this case. The numerical results obtained from the two cases are compared with the available experimental results. A qualitative matching is found between the numerical and experimental results...|$|R

50|$|Solid {{solution}} strengthening {{is a type}} of alloying {{that can}} be used to improve the strength of a pure metal. The technique works by adding atoms of one <b>element</b> (the <b>alloying</b> <b>element)</b> to the crystalline lattice of another element (the base metal), forming a solid solution. The local nonuniformity in the lattice due to the <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> makes plastic deformation more difficult by impeding dislocation motion. In contrast, alloying beyond the solubility limit can form a second phase, leading to strengthening via other mechanisms (e.g. the precipitation of intermetallic compounds).|$|R

2500|$|Metals can be {{heat treated}} {{to alter the}} {{properties}} of strength, ductility, toughness, hardness or resistance to corrosion. [...] Common heat treatment processes include annealing, precipitation hardening, quenching, and tempering. [...] The annealing process softens the metal by allowing recovery of cold work and grain growth. [...] Quenching {{can be used to}} harden alloy steels, or in precipitation hardenable alloys, to trap dissolved solute atoms in solution.

[...] Brazing is similar to soldering, but occurs at temperatures in excess of [...] [...] Brazing has the advantage of producing less thermal stresses than welding, and brazed assemblies tend to be more ductile than weldments because <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> can not segregate and precipitate.|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effect of <b>alloying</b> metal <b>elements</b> on hydrogen solubility and mechanical integrity of Nb-based alloys, Nb 15 M 1 (where M = Ca–Zn, Ge), using first principles-based calculations. In general, the chemical interaction between the interstitial H and metal is weakened as the <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> is changed from an early to a late transition metal, leading to lower H solubility and higher resistance to H embrittlement. This effect becomes more pronounced when a smaller <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> is used due to stronger elastic interaction between interstitial H and metal atoms.
