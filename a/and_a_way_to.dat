5|$|Mayer was {{introduced}} to topology by his colleague Vietoris when attending his lectures in 1926 and 1927 at a local university in Vienna. He was told about the conjectured result <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> its solution, and solved the question for the Betti numbers in 1929. He applied his results to the torus considered as the union of two cylinders. Vietoris later proved the full result for the homology groups in 1930 but did not express it as an exact sequence. The concept of an exact sequence only appeared in print in the 1952 book Foundations of Algebraic Topology by Samuel Eilenberg and Norman Steenrod where the results of Mayer and Vietoris were expressed in the modern form.|$|E
5|$|The {{automobile}} allowed {{people to}} quickly travel long distances <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> mark routes became needed. One early means of marking routes was {{the establishment of}} various auto trail associations in the 1910s. These associations selected good quality roads and marked them with symbols or colors on telephone poles. Most of legislative Route6 eventually {{became part of the}} Yellowstone Trail, a cross-country auto trail established in 1912 that ran from Washington to Massachusetts. In New York, the trail used modern US20 from Pennsylvania to Silver Creek, most of modern NY5 from Silver Creek to Albany, and modern US20 again from Albany to Massachusetts.|$|E

25|$|The island {{now called}} Réunion (French La Réunion) had several names in this era, {{including}} Île Bourbon and Île Bonaparte, reflecting the opposing sides in France. Bourbon {{was the name}} of the royal family deposed by the French Revolution <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> refer to the royalists among the French; Napoleon Bonaparte was the emperor of the expanding French empire. The French ship Caroline was rechristened as HMS Bourbonnaise, both because there was already a ship named Caroline in the Royal Navy, and the island where she was taken had that as one of its names.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} of guitar-playing gradually improved; the early trovadors, being self-taught, had rather limited techniques. Later, some tapped into classical guitar techniques {{to revive the}} accompaniment of the trova. Guyún (Vincente Gonzalez Rubiera, Stgo de C. 27 October 1908Havana, 1987) studied under Severino Lopez, and developed a modern concept of harmony, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> apply classical technique to popular Cuban music. He became more adventurous, yet still in Cuban vein, and in 1938 stopped performing to devote himself to teaching the guitar. This bore fruit, and two generations of Cuban guitarists bear witness to his influence.|$|E

25|$|In 1942, Tordoff {{enlisted in}} the U.S. Army Air Forces, and trained as a fighter pilot. He later recounted that he naively {{imagined}} flying as thrilling, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> avoid ground combat. His depth perception was low by Air Force standards, so he passed his vision test by watching another pilot candidate get tested, and figuring out how the settings worked on the apparatus that was used. In 1943 he earned his wings, and joined the 352nd Fighter Squadron, 353rd Fighter Group, 8th Air Force. He flew a total of 85 missions during the war, {{in support of the}} Allied bombing of Germany, and reached the rank of captain.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, UE joined with other unions in the CIO in urging a no-strike pledge and higher productivity {{for the duration of}} the war, which UE viewed as a struggle against world fascism and therefore worthy of labor's support. The UE also supported expanded use of piecework systems in industry, which it defended as both necessary to boost production <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> improve workers' earnings under the wartime wage control systems imposed by the War Labor Board. This appears, in fact, to be largely true: the incentive systems that management used were their loosest during World War II and represented an important, and generally popular, form of compensation for workers.|$|E

25|$|Māori {{language}} {{advocates have}} recognised radio broadcasting {{as having a}} small but significant role in bringing Māori language to New Zealand audiences {{for more than half}} a century, particularly since the establishment of radio stations under iwi control. Postcolonialists have also suggested the Iwi Radio Network is a form of decolonisation, a means of achieving decolonisation, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> assert cultural identity and challenge Pākeha cultural dominance. Massey University research in 2006 assessed five year qualitative and quantitative research, literature on the long term history of the Māori language, comparative studies between Māori and Irish radio, and Tūhoe's experiences setting up a radio station, and found the Iwi Radio Network had a positive impact on Māori language revitalisation. The stations have failed to counter a decline in the number of fluent Māori speakers in the 2010s, but continue to be part of the strategy to promote it.|$|E
25|$|In a {{research}} experiment, the bull sharks {{were found to}} be at the mouth of an estuary {{for the majority of the}} time. They stayed at the mouth of the river independent of the salinity of the water. The driving factor for a bull shark to be in fresh or salt water, however, is its age; as the bull shark ages, its tolerance for very low or high salinity increases. The majority of the newborn or very young bull sharks were found in the freshwater area, whereas the much older bull sharks {{were found to be}} in the saltwater areas, as they had developed a much better tolerance for the salinity. Reproduction is one of the reasons why adult bull sharks travel into the river—it is thought to be a physiological strategy to improve juvenile survival <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> increase overall fitness of bull sharks. The young are not born with a high tolerance for high salinity, so they are born in fresh water and stay there until they are able to travel out.|$|E
25|$|The Pit Bull Terrier {{was created}} by {{breeding}} Old English Terriers and Old English Bulldogs together to produce a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and athleticism of the bulldog. These dogs (Bull and Terriers) were bred in England, and arrived in the United States where they became the direct ancestors of the American Pit Bull Terrier. In the United Kingdom, Bull-and-terriers were used in bloodsports such as bull baiting, bear baiting. These bloodsports were officially eliminated in 1835 as Britain began to introduce animal welfare laws. Since dogfights were cheaper to organise and far easier to conceal from the law than bull or bear baits, bloodsport proponents turned to pitting their dogs against each other instead. Dog fighting was used as both a bloodsport (often involving gambling) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> continue to test {{the quality of their}} stock. For decades afterwards, dog fighting clandestinely took place in small areas of Britain and America. In the early 20th century, pit bulls were used as catch dogs in America for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt, and drive livestock, and as family companions. Some have been selectively bred for their fighting prowess.|$|E
