5|$|A , or , is one {{of three}} senior members of the Yamayuri Council, {{although}} it is also possible to generally speak of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the Yamayuri Council as roses. A Rose makes the important decisions within this group, since she has control over the student council. Candidates for the position, which lasts through the school year, are chosen through an election. Any student can run to become a Rose, although the position is usually given to the en boutons, the Roses' petite sœurs.|$|E
5|$|Although most justices were {{immediately}} convinced, Warren {{spent some time}} after this famous speech convincing everyone to sign onto the opinion. Justices Jackson and Reed finally decided to drop their dissent. The final decision was unanimous. Warren drafted the basic opinion and kept circulating and revising it until he had an opinion endorsed by <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the Court. Reed was the last holdout and reportedly cried during {{the reading of the}} opinion.|$|E

5|$|Memories of {{more than}} a score of years of devoted service enhance the sense of {{personal}} loss which Miss LeHand's passing brings. Faithful and painstaking, with charm of manner inspired by tact and kindness of heart, she was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty. Hers was a quiet efficiency, which made her a real genius in getting things done. Her memory will ever be held in affectionate remembrance and appreciation, not only by <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of our family but by the wide circle of those whose duties brought them into contact with her.|$|E

5|$|A tribute video played next, {{highlighting}} the wrestlers from ECW that had died between the promotion's end in 2001 and One Night Stand. A three-way dance was next, with Tajiri facing Little Guido Maritato and Super Crazy. Tajiri was accompanied {{to the ring}} by The Sinister Minister and Mikey Whipwreck, and Guido was accompanied by his fellow F.B.I. members. One {{of the highlights of}} the match occurred when Super Crazy deliver a moonsault off the balcony onto <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the F.B.I. Guido was the first eliminated when Whipwreck delivered a Whipper Snapper while the referee was distracted. Tajiri picked up the three count to eliminate Guido. Super Crazy won the match after performing a moonsault off the top rope onto Tajiri, getting the three-count in the process.|$|E
5|$|According to the statutes, the Foundation {{consists}} of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens, with its seat in Stockholm. The Chairman of the Board is appointed by the Swedish King in Council, with the other four members appointed by the trustees of the prize-awarding institutions.

However, since 1995, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the board have been chosen by the trustees, and the Executive Director and the Deputy Director appointed by the board itself.

5|$|After {{the death}} of George XII in December 1800, the Russian general Ivan Lazarev issued the Tsar Paul I's order to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the royal family, {{beginning}} with Darejan, forbidding the nomination of any heir to the throne. After Paul's death in March 1801, Darejan applied to the new tsar, Alexander I, to confirm her eldest son, Iulon, as the new king and protect her and her kin from harassment from George XII's heir Prince David and his supporters. However, the Russian government proceeded with the outright annexation of the Georgian kingdom, bringing the millennium of the Bagratid rule in Georgia to an end.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is {{the fifth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 7 in the periodic table, below manganese, technetium and rhenium. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well. The higher +7 oxidation state {{is more likely to}} exist in oxyanions, such as perbohriate, , analogous to the lighter permanganate, pertechnetate, and perrhenate. Nevertheless, bohrium(VII) is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution, and would probably be easily reduced to the more stable bohrium(IV).|$|E
5|$|By {{making use}} of a new power {{obtained}} by Eren {{that allows him to}} create massive and permanent structures, the Survey Corps hold another expedition, this time managing to reach Shiganshina and seal the breach to reclaim Wall Maria. However, they are ambushed by Zeke, the man behind the Titan invasions and the spies, leading an army of Titans including the Colossal Titan against them. The battle ends with Zeke retreating, and the Colossal Titan defeated and killed by Armin, who became a Titan Shifter like Eren, but at the cost of the lives of almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the expedition, including the commander of the Survey Corps, Erwin Smith.|$|E

5|$|For {{some time}} Monteux had {{felt that he}} should leave the SFSO. He had two main reasons: he {{believed}} that a conductor should not remain in one post for too long, and he wished {{to be free to}} accept more invitations to appear with other orchestras. He resigned from the SFSO {{at the end of the}} 1952 season. He briefly reappeared on the podium at the War Memorial Opera House within a year, as co-conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's coast-to-coast American tour, at Munch's invitation. Almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the SFSO were in the audience, and joined in the ovation given to their former chief.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{opposition}} to the Indian participation in the World War II was motivated by his belief that India could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom while that freedom was denied to India itself. He also condemned Nazism and Fascism, a view which won endorsement of other Indian leaders. As the war progressed, Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, calling for the British to Quit India in a 1942 speech in Mumbai. This was Gandhi's and the Congress Party's most definitive revolt aimed at securing the British exit from India. The British government responded quickly to the Quit India speech, and within hours after Gandhi's speech arrested Gandhi and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the Congress Working Committee. His countrymen retaliated the arrests by damaging or burning down hundreds of government owned railway stations, police stations, and cutting down telegraph wires.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a backup}} relief party of 77 teams and wagons was {{making its way}} east to provide {{additional}} assistance to the Martin Company. After passing Fort Bridger {{the leaders of the}} backup party concluded that the Martin Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. On November 18 the backup party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the handcart party were now able to ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives.

5|$|Nelson's touring and {{recording}} group, the Family, {{is full of}} longstanding members.

The current lineup includes <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> but Jody Payne, who retired, and Bee Spears, who died in 2011. Willie & Family tours North America in the bio-diesel bus Honeysuckle Rose, which is fueled by Bio-Willie. Nelson's tour buses were customized by Florida Coach since 1979. The company built the Honeysuckle Rose I in 1983, which was replaced after a collision in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1990. The interior was salvaged and reused for the second version of the bus the same year. Nelson changed his tour bus in 1996, 2005 and 2013, currently touring on the Honeysuckle Rose V.|$|E
5|$|On Shackleton's return home, public honours {{were quickly}} forthcoming.

He was honoured by the Royal Geographical Society, who awarded him a Gold Medal; a proposal that the medal be smaller than that earlier awarded to Captain Scott was not acted on. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the Nimrod Expedition shore party received silver Polar Medals on 23 November, with Shackleton receiving a clasp to his earlier medal.
