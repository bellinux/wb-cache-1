5|$|Later in the Han Dynasty, mystics like Luan {{gradually}} {{lost their}} influence as the rulers passed many laws against them. Mediums {{were not allowed}} to barter their crafts alongside roads, and some were even forbidden to make <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>at</b> such a craft at all. Those married to shamans were not even allowed to hold government office, though this law was often bypassed. Luan Da's fall signaled {{the beginning of the end}} for these mystics.|$|E

25|$|Blackford was {{enrolled}} in Princeton University at age sixteen and graduated {{at the top of}} his class in 1806. On his enrollment forms he entered his middle name as Newton, but never again used the name during his life. Among his fifty-four classmates were John Williams Walker, James Iradell, John James Marshall, and Patrick Noble. Blackford became fluent in Greek and Latin and excelled in history. He also spent a considerable amount of time reading legal books on English common law. After college he studied law for a year in the office of Revolutionary War hero Colonel George MacDonald before moving on in 1810 to complete his legal studies in the office of New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Gabriel Ford in Morristown. He was admitted to the bar in New Jersey that same year. He took only one case of his own and realized he needed to join a law firm if he was going to be able to earn <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>at</b> his profession. He returned to his hometown and joined MacDonald's firm.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{expiration}} {{of his contract}} on the Star Wars newspaper strip, Williamson found that the weight of doing both pencil and inks suddenly became stressful to him, drastically reducing his output. As a response to this, in the mid-1980s Williamson made a successful transition to becoming strictly an inker, beginning at DC Comics inking Curt Swan on Superman #408–410 and #412–416. The longtime Man of Steel artist would later describe Williamson as [...] "his favorite inker". Williamson then moved to Marvel where he inked such pencillers such as John Buscema, Gene Colan, Rick Leonardi, Mike Mignola, Pat Oliffe, John Romita Jr., Lee Weeks, and many others. John Romita Sr., Marvel's art director during that time, considered Williamson to be [...] "one of the best pencillers {{in the world but}} he really can't make <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>at</b> penciling because he wants to do these beautifully pencilled pages with ample time to do them. That's why Al is inking now ... and adding a greater dimension to the penciller he's working with." [...] He won nine industry awards for Best Inker between 1988 and 1997.|$|E

In August 2012 Saddington appeared on celebrity musician quiz show, RocKwiz, on SBS-TV, where she performed Simone's [...] "Backlash Blues".

But {{at the same time}} I have always thought I {{would have liked to have}} earned <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>at</b> it". She believed that Krishna Consciousness had [...] "saved my life", reviewing her life as a heavy drinker [...] "I honestly think if I had gone on with that, it would have ended up like Janis Joplin.

2500|$|During {{its initial}} years {{the company had}} {{occasionally}} had to purchase wheat from other sources to meet the RAC demands. In 1840 John McLoughlin had to purchase 4,000 bushels of wheat from Alta California to supplement produce made by the PSAC. During the 1840s pastoral and agricultural produce shipped to New Archangel annually consistently was 30,000lbs of beef and from 40,000 to 80,000lbs of wheat. Governor Arvid Etholén praised wheat produced by the PSAC as [...] "incomparably cheaper" [...] than produced bought from American merchants and being of [...] "the best quality." [...] Despite the PSAC's initial growth, its principal manager, John McLoughlin didn't hold a favorable view of the venture. In a letter written to Douglas prior to the 1838 London meetings, McLoughlin criticized what eventually became the PSAC:"I will {{take this opportunity to}} state it is my opinion that, though I think individuals who would devote their attention to raising cattle in the Columbia might make <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>at</b> it still it is my opinion the Hudson's Bay Company will make nothing by it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{continued}} {{this transformation}} with an unexpected cover of Joy Division's [...] "Love Will Tear Us Apart", which was released {{as a single}} in 1988 on Product Inc. in a confusing array of 7" [...] and 12" [...] inch formats. Both Gira and Jarboe sang lead vocals on {{different versions of the}} song. In later years Gira dismissed this release as a mistake, {{and for a long time}} refused to reissue his own vocal version, although Jarboe's version was re-released much sooner. However their version of the song was a hit on US college radio in 1988, which led to the group being offered a major label deal at Uni/MCA. [...] "I'd worked so hard all my life", said Gira. [...] "At 15, I was digging ditches in the desert in Israel, and I put myself through college painting houses. I never saw any money from any of our records. So by the time I finally got that carrot dangled in front of me, it was like, 'at last, I can make <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>at</b> what I love to do.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1884 or 1885, Smith {{attended}} the Philadelphia School of Design for Women (now Moore College of Art and Design) and in 1885 {{attended the}} Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA) in Philadelphia under Thomas Eakins' and Thomas Anshute's supervision. It was under Eakins that Smith {{began to use}} photography as a resource in her illustrations. Although Eakins' demeanor could be difficult, particularly with female students, {{he became one of}} her first major influences. In May 1888, while Smith was still at the Pennsylvania Academy, her illustration Three Little Maidens All in a Row was published in the St. Nicholas Magazine. Illustration was one artistic avenue in which women could make <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>at</b> the time. At this time, creating illustrations for children's books or of family life was considered an appropriate career for woman artists because it drew upon maternal instincts. Alternatively, fine art that included life drawing was not considered [...] "ladylike." [...] Illustration partly became viable due to both the improved color printing processes and the resurgence in England of book design.|$|E

2500|$|Pet usage is {{the primary}} market for trapped painted turtles {{although}} a small number are sent to turtle races. Commercial trapping is modest economically, with double digits of trappers, selling a few thousand turtles yearly, at $1–2 per turtle. Individual harvesters who trap painted turtles typically do so for extra money and alternate between fishing and turtle trapping based on the markets. Many have been traditionally involved in the trade: Ben Hedstrom of Minnesota said, [...] "We've sold turtles for 50 years. My dad did it since the 1920s." [...] Some harvesters disagree with limiting the catch. Rex Campbell of Minnesota said, [...] "I {{can go out and}} catch more turtles today than I did 10 years ago. I don't see that it's hurting the turtle population. The last thing I want to see {{is the end of the}} resource we've all depended on for a long time.

2500|$|He {{was born}} Max Harrison, the {{youngest}} child and only son of Benjamin Harrison (February 1868 – 1933) and Pauline Harrison (July 1870–?), Jewish immigrants from Lithuania (then the Russian Empire). Max {{grew up in}} New York City, first in lower Manhattan and later the Bronx, with three sisters, who doted on “the baby” of the family. As a young child Max decided to replace his birth name with [...] "Robert." [...] Early on Robert appeared magnanimous, if only due to a tendency to quickly forget slights as he could be not bothered {{to focus on the}} negative. In school he did poorly at math but well at English. He wanted to write for <b>a</b> <b>living.</b> <b>At</b> the age of 12 he authored and published a travel guide to roadside inns, Harrison's Weekend Guide. After the printer refused to give Harrison his share of the profits, Harrison formed a belief that one could only trust family members, whom he would later employ in various publishing projects.

2500|$|Dance {{competition}} {{had been}} a part of American television for decades before the premiere of So You Think You Can Dance, but usually in the form of all-around talent searches, (such as Star Search, Soul Train, or Showtime at the Apollo). [...] However, [...] a season-long American Idol-like talent-search show with a sole focus on dance had never been broadcast on American network television. [...] Producers and judges associated with the show have stated on numerous occasions, both {{within the context of the}} show and in interviews, that the series was meant to rejuvenate the visibility and appreciation of dance as an art form in the U.S. and to give exposure to struggling dancers. [...] Series judge Mary Murphy says, for example, [...] "Of course you hope you can make <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>at</b> it, because you don't want to give up on something that you do, but the honest truth is most dancers have to carry one or two jobs and dance as much as they can on the side -- it's a very lucky dancer who gets a full scholarship." [...] A number of dance-themed competition shows have been produced for American television since the premiere of So You Think You Can Dance, including America's Best Dance Crew, Superstars of Dance, and Live to Dance.|$|E

The band's first Indian date, in Shillong When the Maharaja of Tripura Kirit Pradyot Deb Burman invited them, took place {{in front of a}} sold out stadium crowd of over 40,000, setting a record for that city. The band toured in 2005, 2006, and launched another tour in 2007 visiting states in the Midwest United States such as North Dakota and playing at several festivals including Rocklahoma. In a March 2007 interview, when asked about the band's next album, guitarist Bill Leverty said [...] "we plan on going into the studio this coming winter. Hopefully, we’ll be able to get all the songs together and record them for a spring/summer release." [...] Regarding the future of the band, C. J.

2500|$|In the {{following}} year Laud initiated a visitation of all the dioceses in the Province of Canterbury, which was overseen in Staffordshire and Shropshire by Nathaniel Brent. This led to a widespread imposition of [...] "Catholic" [...] features, including altars and images. St Chad's was decorated with religious pictures, illustrating Biblical narratives. Studley, in his moment of triumph, was presented {{with the opportunity to}} leave the scene by appointment to <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>at</b> Pontesbury. Mackworth was closely involved in the issue of his replacement, as the right of appointment was claimed by the town. The bailiffs duly appointed Richard Poole on 29 March 1637. Close enquiry proved this to be unfounded. There was an old tradition, long since discounted, that St Chad's was a royal chapel, giving the Crown an opportunity to claim it as a royal peculiar. Laud challenged the appointment by a successful quo warranto action, and the living was taken back into royal hands. The issue was then subsumed into the town's renegotiation of its charter, in which Mackworth acted for the corporation. In 1638, a compromise engineered by Sir Richard Newport finally renewed the charter and left Poole in place, expanding the council and giving both the [...] "religious party" [...] of Mackworth and their opponents representation. Mackworth's position as an alderman of Shrewsbury was confirmed. In July of that year he married Mary Venables, his first wife having died in 1636.|$|E
2500|$|As Fisher was Barker's choice, it {{is likely}} that the two men had similar views from the outset, so it is not {{surprising}} to find Fisher taking up the Puritan cause during his incumbency at Upton Magna. He seems to have followed controversies in Shrewsbury, which was very close. In a preface to some sermons he published in the 1650s, Fisher denounced those who had endangered his liberty by traducing his doctrine. While this might have applied to several phases of his career, he added in the margin: [...] "Mr Studley and some others." [...] At the time of Fisher's appointment Studley had become mired in a controversy over his book, The Looking-glasse of Schisme in which he sought to explain a sensational murder at Clun as the result of the Puritan principles of the killer. The book was published in London in 1634 and reissued in an expanded edition in 1635. Under Thorough, the experiment in absolute monarchy then in force, a reasoned reply by Richard More, a layman of St Chad's parish, could not be published and it did not appear until 1641. After the furore, Studley resigned from St Chad's and moved a few miles to <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>at</b> Pontesbury. Whether his offence to Fisher was more personal than the contents of his polemic is unknown. Certainly Fisher was not one to ignore intemperate abuse of his faith. He wrote to Sir Robert Harley, then serving as MP for Herefordshire in the Long Parliament, to report some anti-Puritan banter that might have serious implications.|$|E

In his 20s he attended barber school, got married, and moved first to Roy, New Mexico, then returned to Turkey in Hall County (now considered his home town) to work as a barber at Hamm's Barber Shop. He alternated barbering and fiddling even when he moved to Fort Worth after leaving Hall County in 1929. There he played in minstrel and medicine shows, and, as with other Texas musicians such as Ocie Stockard, continued to earn money as a barber. He wore blackface makeup to appear in comedy routines, something that was common at the time. [...] "He was playing his violin and singing." [...] There were two guitars and a banjo player with him. [...] "Bob was in blackface and was the comic; he cracked jokes, sang, and did an amazing jig dance." [...] Since there was already a [...] "Jim" [...] on the show, the manager began calling him [...] "Bob".
