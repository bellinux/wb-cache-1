5|$|Arachnids are {{important}} to the forest ecology, as both predators and prey. In some forest types, such as tabonuco forest, they are the major arboreal invertebrate predators; spiders being the most abundant representative. The Maricao Commonwealth Forest's 27 spider species belong to five families: Uloboridae, Pholcidae, Theridiidae, Linyphiidae and Araneidae. Theotima minutissima, a small spider species found in <b>abundance</b> <b>in</b> the Caribbean National Forest, is believed to be parthenogenetic, meaning that it reproduces without fertilization by a male.|$|E

Examples include the short-cist burials found near West Newbigging, about a mile to the North of the town. These burials included pottery urns, a pair of silver discs and a gold armlet. Iron Age archaeology is also well represented, for example in the souterrain nearby Warddykes Cemetery and at West Grange of Conan, as well as the better-known examples at Carlungie and Ardestie.|$|E

Juveniles tend to remain in a localized area throughout the year, while adults range over a wider area.|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{examination}} of the sun's upper atmosphere reveals that elemental abundances vary between different solar regions. Some solar regions exhibit the well-established photospheric <b>abundances,</b> while <b>in</b> other regions the abundances of some elements diverge from photospheric by an order of magnitude, and perhaps even more. Elemental <b>abundances</b> <b>in</b> the solar wind (SW) are also different from elemental <b>abundances</b> <b>in</b> the photosphere. It is postulated that elemental <b>abundances</b> <b>in</b> the SW reflect the elemental abundances of their place of origin near the solar surface. The solar surface is covered, predominantly, by quiet and coronal hole regions. In this paper we measure the intensities of limb-brightening rings over quiet and coronal hole regions in lines of Mg VI and Ne VI (Te is approximately equal to 4. 3 x 10 exp 5 K) and determine the relative elemental abundances of the features producing the rings. The rings are formed by a plasma component occupying {{only a small fraction}} of the immediate volume above the solar surface...|$|R

Our new results, combined with data on <b>abundances</b> <b>in</b> the very central part of our Galaxy taken from literature, show that iron, magnesium, silicon, sulfur, calcium and titanium LTE abundance radial distributions, as well as NLTE distribution of oxygen reveal a plateau-like structure or even positive <b>abundance</b> gradient <b>in</b> the region extending from the Galactic center to about 5 kpc...|$|R
5|$|The Beaker culture arrived around 2,500BC, {{introducing}} {{drinking and}} food vessels constructed from clay, {{as well as}} vessels used as reduction pots to smelt copper ores. It was during this time that major Neolithic monuments such as Stonehenge and Avebury were constructed. By heating together tin and copper, which were in <b>abundance</b> <b>in</b> the area, the Beaker culture people made bronze, and later iron from iron ores. The development of iron smelting allowed the construction of better ploughs, advancing agriculture (for instance, with Celtic fields), {{as well as the}} production of more effective weapons.|$|E
5|$|Uranium is a {{naturally}} occurring element {{that can be}} found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. Uranium is the 51st element in order of <b>abundance</b> <b>in</b> the Earth's crust. Uranium is also the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on Earth and is almost always found combined with other elements. The decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium-40 in the Earth's mantle is thought to be the main source of heat that keeps the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection, which in turn drives plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of life on Earth lives in mesophyllic (moderate) environments, a few organisms, most of them microbes, have managed to colonise extreme environments that are unsuitable for most higher life forms. There are bacteria, for example, living in Lake Whillans, half a mile below the ice of Antarctica; in the absence of sunlight, they must rely on organic material from elsewhere, perhaps decaying matter from glacier melt water or minerals from the underlying rock. Other bacteria can be found in <b>abundance</b> <b>in</b> the Mariana Trench, the deepest place in the ocean and on Earth; marine snow drifts down from the surface layers of the sea and accumulates in this undersea valley, providing nourishment for an extensive community of bacteria.|$|E

The light elements show marked interstation variability at the site. The <b>abundances</b> <b>in</b> soils of C, N, He, and H are apparently controlled mainly by exposure to the solar wind, through implantation or stripping processes. Carbon abundances (but not observed isotopic distributions) are compatible with a model in which equilibrium is established after 10, 000 - 100, 000 yr between solar wind input and loss by proton stripping.

5|$|Germanium's <b>abundance</b> <b>in</b> the Earth's {{crust is}} {{approximately}} 1.6ppm. Only a few minerals like argyrodite, briartite, germanite, and renierite contain appreciable amounts of germanium, and none in mineable deposits. Some zinc-copper-lead ore bodies contain enough germanium to justify extraction {{from the final}} ore concentrate. An unusual natural enrichment process causes a high content of germanium in some coal seams, discovered by Victor Moritz Goldschmidt during a broad survey for germanium deposits. The highest concentration ever found was in Hartley coal ash with as much as 1.6% germanium. The coal deposits near Xilinhaote, Inner Mongolia, contain an estimated 1600tonnes of germanium.|$|E
5|$|Herring, a fish {{which takes}} well to salting, became a well {{established}} catch; the busiest harbour was Aberystwyth, which reportedly took up to 1,000 barrels of herring {{in a single}} night in 1724. Many other villages also fished for herring, generally between late August and December. Herring, along with mackerel, trout, salmon and sea trout, were the main fishes found in Welsh cuisine. Salmon was abundant and therefore a staple for the poor. Trout, which would dry out quickly when cooked, would be wrapped in leek leaves for cooking, or covered in bacon or oatmeal. Many fish would be served with fennel, which grew wild in <b>abundance</b> <b>in</b> Wales.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen, as atomic H, is {{the most}} {{abundant}} chemical element in the universe, making up 75% of normal matter by mass and more than 90% by number of atoms.

40|$|Despite {{differences}} in the species compositions and absolute abundances of planktonic microorganisms in fresh- and saltwater, there are broad similarities in microbial food webs across systems. Relative abundances of bacteria and nanoplanktonic protozoa (HNAN, primarily heterotrophic flagellates) are similar in marine and freshwater environments, which suggests analogous trophic relationships. Ranges of microbe <b>abundances</b> <b>in</b> marine and fresh waters overlap, and seasonal changes <b>in</b> <b>abundances</b> within an ecosystem are often as great as differences <b>in</b> <b>abundances</b> between freshwater and marine systems of similar productivities. Densities of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoplankton, therefore, are strongly related {{to the degree of}} eutrophication, and not salt per se. Data from the literature is compiled to demonstrate a remarkably consistent numerical relationship (ca 1000 bacteria: 1 HNAN) between bacterioplankton and HNAN from the euphotic zones of a variety of marine and freshwater systems. Based on the results of a simple food web model involving bacterial growth, bacterial removal by HNAN, predation on HNAN, and the observed relationships between bacterial and HNAN <b>abundances</b> <b>in</b> natural ecosystems, it is possible to demonstrate that bottom-up control (food supply) is more important <b>in</b> regulating bacterial <b>abundances</b> <b>in</b> oligotrophic environments while top-down control (predation) is more important in eutrophic environments...|$|R
5|$|Illegal {{trade routes}} {{are known to}} exist from Cambodia, to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, with much of this trade destined for China. Surveys from 1998 and 1999 show that 80 to 90 animals were {{imported}} from Vietnam though Hekou Port into Yunnan province, making it the most commonly recorded animal in the surveys. China is the primary destination of most Vietnamese slow lorises, although they are also smuggled to other countries, including Taiwan. In one noted incident, 102 animals were confiscated during transit to Ho Chi Minh City in August 1993; of these, only four survived. Pygmy lorises may cost up to US$400 on the Taiwanese pet market. In the USA, occasionally, pygmy lorises smuggled from Vietnam have been confiscated. The Endangered Primate Rescue Centre reports that the pygmy slow loris is the most often rescued species, which reflects their <b>abundance</b> <b>in</b> trade. In Europe, illegal purchases have been reported from Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Moscow.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the results}} of a search for giant planets in the {{globular}} cluster 47 Tucanae were announced. The lack of any successful discoveries suggests that the abundance of elements (other than hydrogen or helium) necessary to build these planets may need to be at least 40% of the <b>abundance</b> <b>in</b> the Sun. Terrestrial planets are built from heavier elements such as silicon, iron and magnesium. The very low abundance of these elements in globular clusters means that the member stars have a far lower likelihood of hosting Earth-mass planets, when compared to stars in the neighborhood of the Sun. Hence the halo region of the Milky Way galaxy, including globular cluster members, are unlikely to host habitable terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|In towns, the Cape sparrow {{competes with}} both the native {{southern}} grey-headed sparrow and house sparrow, which was introduced to southern Africa in the 19thcentury.

A survey by birdwatchers completed in 2000 found the Cape sparrow increasing in <b>abundance</b> <b>in</b> some suburban areas of South Africa (the northern Johannesburg area, and Pietermaritzburg) and decreasing in others (the southern Cape Town area). The house sparrow was reported decreasing in several urban areas, {{as it has in}} parts of Europe, declines which are attributed to factors including the increasing density of garden plantings and increases in predation.|$|E

5|$|Iridium {{is one of}} {{the nine}} least {{abundant}} stable elements in Earth's crust, having an average mass fraction of 0.001ppm in crustal rock; gold is 40 times more abundant, platinum is 10 times more abundant, and silver and mercury are 80 times more abundant.
