40|$|Financial markets use auctions {{to provide}} {{accurate}} liquidity snapshots for traded instruments. Combination orders, such as time spreads require the atomic trading {{of more than}} one security contract. In order to auction such complex order types, a new design, which considers all contingent instruments simultaneously, is required. This work develops an optimization model and a software implementation of the dualsided multi-unit combinatorial auction problem. The optimization objective is finding an equilibrium price vector and a winner selection such that the auction turnover is maximized. The <b>auction</b> <b>requirements</b> are modeled as a discrete optimization problem, suitable for standard integer programming solvers. The model’s correctness and tractability are tested using synthetically generated orders as well as real market data. Test results with both synthetic and authentic orders produced equilibrium prices within 3 % of the expected instrument valuations, using closing prices as a benchmark, indicating high accuracy of the solutions. The use of combinatorial auctions exposes greater liquidity and overall turnover, both valuable to exchanges that receive large numbers of combination orders...|$|R

30|$|The {{establishment}} of the MBR Solar Park is one very important factor for the results in Dubai because this designated government location ensures well known solar resources as well as necessary grid connections. Both factors, coupled with the credibility of DEWA as a stable electricity off-taker, support access to low-cost financing. Furthermore, the Dubai auctions have been for massive projects with the third phase auction targeting a mandatory 200  MW capacity to be commissioned in 2018 and two optional 300  MW tranches for delivery 2019 and 2020. The scale of these projects allows for substantial economies of scale when auction bids are developed. Similar to the auctions conducted in Morocco, Dubai has leveraged multiple qualification phases to ensure that only the strongest consortia are selected. In the MBR phase three auction, 97 consortia submitted an expression of interest (EOI) {{to participate in the}} tender but only about 40 were invited to submit a request to prequalify. Of these 40 consortia, 24 responded and 14 consortia were finally prequalified and invited to submit bids. Because of the very stringent DEWA <b>auction</b> <b>requirements</b> and the high cost associated with submitting a bid, only 5 consortia ended up submitting proposals. The lowest bid submitted was from a consortium consisting of Masdar, an Abu Dhabi owned company, and Spanish developer FRV, previously acquired by Saudi Arabia’s Abdul Latif Jameel (ALJ) group in 2015.|$|R
40|$|Generating {{government}} revenue {{is a common}} objective in privatization. This paper asks: what determines privatization prices? Pursuing this query helps resolve the current controversies about the bearing of speed and the role for government actions prior to privatization. The data, gathered from primary sources, encompass 361 privatized Mexican companies in 49 four-digit industry codes. The determinants of auction privatization prices are divided into three groups: (1) company performance and industry parameters; (2) the auction process and its requirements; and (3) the prior restructuring actions taken by the government. Controlling for company and industry effects reveals the significant impact of the costs and characteristics of the labor force. Minority control packages carry large discounts. <b>Auction</b> <b>requirements</b> that allow foreign investors result in higher sale premia, while restrictions constraining participation or payment forms reduce net prices. The speed of privatization substantially influences net prices: the longer it takes to put the company on the block, the more severe the deterioration in performance, and the lower the premium obtained. Pre-sale reductions in labor force, and particularly the firing of CEOs, lead to significantly higher premiums. Debt absorption, investment, and performance improvement programs do not increase the net price, while de-investment measures prove more beneficial. Overall, the results show increased premia for government actions that stimulate bidder participation and expedite the privatization process. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{government}} procurement <b>auctions,</b> eligibility <b>requirements</b> are often imposed and, perhaps not surprisingly, contracts generally {{have a small}} number of participating bidders. To understand the effects of the restrictions of competition on the total cost of {{government procurement}}, we develop, identify, and estimate a principal-agent model in which the government selects a contractor to undertake a project. We consider three reasons why restricting entry could be beneficial to the government: by decreasing bid processing and solicitation costs, by increasing the chance of selecting a favored contractor and consequently reaping benefits from the favored contractor, and by decreasing the expected amount of price to the winning contractor. When the participation is costly and bidders are heterogeneous, the expected amount of price to the winning contractor may decrease by excluding ex-ante less efficient contractors. Using our estimates, we quantify the effects of the eligibility restrictions on the total cost of procurement. ...|$|R

The found attack consists of authentication breach and secret retrieval. It is a kind of “man in the middle attack”. The intruder impersonates an agent and learns some secret information. We have discovered this flaw unsing OFMC an automatic tool of cryptographic protocol verification. After a description of this attack, we propose {{a new version of the}} e-auction protocol. We also check with OFMC the secrecy for the new protocol and give an informal proof of the other properties that this new e-auction protocol has to guarantee. ...|$|R

40|$|Auctions are {{important}} market mechanisms for {{the allocation of}} goods and services. Auction theory has caught tremendous interest from both the economic side {{as well as the}} Internet industry. The popularity of <b>auctions</b> and the <b>requirements</b> of e-business have led to growing interest in the development of complex trading models. Design of auctions is a multidisciplinary effort comprised of contributions from economics, operations research, informatics, and other disciplines. Combinatorial auctions have recently generated significant interest as an automated mechanism for buying and selling bundles of goods. They are proving to be extremely useful in numerous e-business applications. Important issues in the design of combinatorial auctions are presented. Iterative combinatorial auctions with multiple criteria are proposed complex trading models. The iterative procedure is composed of three key components: a preference model, an optimization model, and a negotiation model...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} here develops a distributed systems architecture and propose an implementation framework for conducting dependable Internet based on-line <b>auctions,</b> meeting the <b>requirements</b> of scalability and service integrity. Current auction services essentially {{rely on a}} central auction server. Given the increasing popularity and usage of electronic auctions, such a centralised approach is fundamentally restrictive with respect to scalability. Further, different national markets have different monetary regulations and may employ different procedures for payment settlements. Catering for local market autonomy means that decentralisation is an essential and practical requirement. With these design goals in mind, the paper develops an approach that permits an auction service to be mapped on to globally distributed auction servers. It then proposes a framework for a fault-tolerant implementation of the architecture. Faulttolerance is achieved through matured technologies: replication management and group paradigm.

40|$|This chapter reports an {{application}} of game theory to market design. Like most practical work, it uses a few key principles derived from theoretical studies, rather than any particular model or explicit mathematical analysis. The purpose of market design {{is to increase the}} efficiency of the market outcome by suppressing strategic behavior or rendering it ineffective. One part of this task is to eliminate loopholes in the procedural rules that might be exploited by a wily trader, but the more fundamental part is to devise rules that promote efficiency. In the case of an iterated multi-market <b>auction,</b> the key <b>requirement</b> is reliable price discovery. That is, the rules should encourage suppliers to reveal their costs, and demanders their values, steadily throughout the bidding process. This is necessary because any one supplier typically relies on the pattern of prices across the markets to devise its optimal bidding strategy, taking account of its variable and fixed costs of operation. Similarly, each demander relies on the pattern of prices to construct its optimal plan of purchases, taking account o...|$|R
40|$|We study auctions with {{additive}} valuations where {{agents have}} {{a limit on}} the number of goods they may receive. We refer to such valuations as capacitated and seek mechanisms that maximize social welfare and are simultaneously incentive compatible, envy-free, individually rational, and have no positive transfers. If capacities are infinite, then sequentially repeating the 2 nd price Vickrey <b>auction</b> meets these <b>requirements.</b> In 1983, Leonard showed that for unit capacities, VCG with Clarke Pivot payments is also envy free. For capacities that are all unit or all infinite, the mechanism produces a Walrasian pricing (subject to capacity constraints). Here, we consider general capacities. For homogeneous capacities (all capacities equal) we show that VCG with Clarke Pivot payments is envy free (VCG with Clarke Pivot payments is always incentive compatible, individually rational, and has no positive transfers). Contrariwise, there is no incentive compatible Walrasian pricing. For heterogeneous capacities, we show that there is no mechanism with all 4 properties, but at least in some cases, one can achieve both incentive compatibility and envy freeness...|$|R

Six main lessons are identified: (i) a commitment to achieving and maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, especially prudent fiscal policy, should underpin market development; (ii) a sound and transparent public debt management strategy supports secondary market activity; (iii) a deep and diverse investor base is required; (iv) poor market infrastructure leads to high transaction costs, slow order execution, and excessive operational risk, which all inhibit trading; (v) secondary market growth is facilitated by effective monetary policy implementation; and (vi) reforms should be sequenced to ensure even development of all the structures supporting the secondary market.
