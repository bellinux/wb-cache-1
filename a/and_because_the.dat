5|$|An {{episode of}} the {{television}} programme Garrow's Law (2010) is loosely based on the legal events arising from the massacre. The historical William Garrow did not {{take part in the}} case, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Zong captain died shortly after arriving in Jamaica, his appearance in court for fraud is also fictional.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the cats}} were {{registered}} as Abyssinians in the import certificates, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Meadows had been breeders of Abyssinian, Burmese, and Siamese, some {{have speculated that}} the Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by CFA Judges. The resemblance of some Burmese/Abyssinian cross to the Singapura, {{as well as the}} Singapura's small litter size, which is uncommon in natural breeds, added more doubts to the Meadows' story.|$|E

5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{played the}} lead role in two Python films, Holy Grail and Life of Brian. He was chosen to play the lead in Holy Grail because of the group's respect towards his {{straight}} acting skills, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> other members wanted to play lesser, funnier characters. Chapman did not mind being filmed fully nude {{in front of a}} crowd in Life of Brian, but the scene, filmed in Tunisia, caused problems with the female Muslim extras.|$|E
5|$|Duvall, who had {{appeared}} in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), which Foote adapted from the Harper Lee novel, was involved in Tender Mercies as an actor and co-producer from its earliest stages. He said the script appealed to him because of the basic values it underlined <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> themes were universal even though the story was local. Duvall felt it portrayed people from the central region of the United States without parodying them, as he said many Hollywood films tend to do. Duvall's early involvement led to rumors that he had requested Foote write the script for him, something that both men denied.|$|E

In 1988, he was a proponent of the two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict (1948), and voted {{for the establishment of}} the State of Palestine {{at a meeting of the}} PNC in Algiers. In 1993, Said quit his membership to the Palestinian National Council, to protest the internal politics that led to the signing of the Oslo Accords (Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, 1993), which he thought had unacceptable terms, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> terms had been rejected by the Madrid Conference of 1991.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Catawba {{sued the}} state of South Carolina and 76 public and private land-owning entities, as named representatives of a {{defendant}} class estimated at 27,000 persons. The tribe contended that the Treaty of Nation Ford was void because of the federal Nonintercourse Act <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> state had not {{lived up to its}} obligations (by delaying the purchase for 2.5 years, by spending only $2,000 on the new reservation, and buying land for the new reservation from within the old reservation). The tribe sought both possession of the lands and 140 years of trespass damages. The Catawba were represented by the Native American Rights Fund (NARF).|$|E
5|$|In late 1857, Bologna's inquisitor Father Pier Feletti {{heard that}} Anna Morisi, {{who had worked}} in the Mortara house for six years, had {{secretly}} baptised Edgardo when she had thought he was about to die as a baby. The Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition held that this made the child irrevocably a Catholic <b>and,</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Papal States forbade the raising of Christians by members of other faiths, ordered that he be taken from his family and brought up by the Church. Police came to the Mortara home late on 23 June 1858 and removed Edgardo the following evening.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} show the {{differences}} between communication styles, Rosenberg started to use two animals. Violent communication was represented by the carnivorous Jackal {{as a symbol of}} aggression and especially dominance. The herbivorous Giraffe on the other hand, represented his NVC strategy. The Giraffe was chosen as symbol for NVC as its long neck is supposed to show the clear-sighted speaker, being aware of his fellow speakers' reactions; <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Giraffe has a large heart, representing the compassionate side of NVC. In his courses he tended to use these animals {{in order to make the}} differences in communication clearer to the audience.|$|E
5|$|In particular, the {{proposal}} {{of building the}} biggest offshore wind power production facility {{in the world in}} southwestern Spain in the coast of Cádiz, on the spot of the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar has been met with strong opposition who fear for tourism and fisheries in the area, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> area is a war grave.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} year of the occupation, the German {{administration}} pursued a conciliatory policy toward the Belgian people in order to gain their support and co-operation. This policy was, in part, because there was little resistance activity <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> demands the Germans needed to place on Belgian civilians and businesses were relatively small on account of their military success. During the fighting in Belgium, however, there were incidents of massacres against Belgian civilians by German forces, notably the Vinkt Massacre in which 86 civilians were killed.|$|E

5|$|Keir Starmer, {{director}} of the CPS, announced on 24 May 2011 that a summons for manslaughter had been issued against Harwood. He said the CPS had reviewed its decision not to prosecute because new medical evidence had emerged during the inquest, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> various medical accounts, including that of the first pathologist, had been tested during questioning. The trial opened on 18 June 2012. Harwood entered a plea of not guilty, and was acquitted on 19 July.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski and {{the first}} Polish {{government}} were distrusted in the West because Piłsudski had cooperated with the Central Powers in 1914–17 <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> governments of Daszyński and Jędrzej Moraczewski were primarily socialist.

Because the gun was used by {{a person with a}} criminal history, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> NYPD was denied requests to look up the seller of the gun, legislators sought {{to make it easier for}} law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is not {{threatened by}} human activity, and is widespread throughout its range. The clearing of forests by humans, though harmful to many species, has benefited the American goldfinch. Clearing of woodlands causes declines in numbers of neotropical migrants, while favoring short-distance migrants and permanent residents. This benefits the American goldfinch {{both as a}} short-distance migrant, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> created open areas are the preferred environment of the bird, where weeds thrive which produce the primary food source of the American goldfinch.|$|E
5|$|The Franklin D. Roosevelt {{administration}} {{proposed the}} New Deal {{to combat the}} depression.
