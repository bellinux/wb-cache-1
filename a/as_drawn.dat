5|$|Nefarious {{asserts that}} there is a link between the {{international}} sex industry and legal prostitution in the Western world, and that those who create the demand for forced prostitution around the world are {{of a wide variety of}} ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and brutality of the sex industry in Eastern Europe with the openness of public prostitution in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests that sex trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes with victims of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former <b>as</b> <b>drawn</b> into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.|$|E

25|$|According to his uncle, Ernest Morphy, no one {{formally}} taught Morphy {{how to play}} chess; rather, Morphy {{learned on}} his own {{as a young child}} simply from watching others play. After silently watching a lengthy game between Ernest and Alonzo, which they abandoned <b>as</b> <b>drawn,</b> young Paul surprised them by stating that Ernest should have won. His father and uncle had not realized that Paul knew the moves, let alone any chess strategy. They were even more surprised when Paul proved his claim by resetting the pieces and demonstrating the win his uncle had missed.|$|E
25|$|The Legislature is {{composed}} of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

25|$|In Leonardo's {{notebooks}} {{there is}} an array of war machines which includes a vehicle to be propelled by two men powering crank shafts. Although the drawing itself looks quite finished, the mechanics were apparently not fully developed because, if built <b>as</b> <b>drawn,</b> the vehicle would never progress in a forward direction. In a BBC documentary, a military team built the machine and changed the gears {{in order to make}} the machine work. It has been suggested that Leonardo deliberately left this error in the design, in order to prevent it from being put to practice by unauthorized people. Another machine, propelled by horses with a pillion rider, carries in front of it four scythes mounted on a revolving gear, turned by a shaft driven by the wheels of a cart behind the horses.|$|E
25|$|Vitruvius {{is famous}} for asserting in his book De architectura that a {{structure}} must exhibit the three qualities of firmitas, utilitas, venustas – that is, it must be solid, useful, beautiful. These are sometimes termed the Vitruvian virtues or the Vitruvian Triad. According to Vitruvius, architecture is an imitation of nature. As birds and bees built their nests, so humans constructed housing from natural materials, that gave them shelter against the elements. When perfecting this art of building, the Greeks invented the architectural orders: Doric, Ionic and Corinthian. It gave {{them a sense of}} proportion, culminating in understanding the proportions of the greatest work of art: the human body. This led Vitruvius in defining his Vitruvian Man, <b>as</b> <b>drawn</b> later by Leonardo da Vinci: the human body inscribed in the circle and the square (the fundamental geometric patterns of the cosmic order).|$|E
25|$|Other {{terms are}} used to {{describe}} the lion's position in further detail. It should be noted that each coat of arms has a right and left (i.e. dexter and sinister) side - with respect to the person carrying the shield - so {{the left side of the}} shield <b>as</b> <b>drawn</b> on the page (thus the right side to the shield bearer) is called the dexter side. The lion's head is normally seen in agreement with the overall position, facing dexter (left) unless otherwise stated. If a lion's whole body is turned to face right, he is to sinister or contourné. If his whole body faces the viewer, he is affronté. If his head only faces the viewer he is guardant or gardant, and if he looks back over his shoulder he is regardant. These adjectives follow any other adjectives of position.|$|E

25|$|Mickey's eyes, <b>as</b> <b>drawn</b> in Plane Crazy and The Gallopin' Gaucho, {{were large}} and white with black {{outlines}}. In Steamboat Willie, the bottom {{portion of the}} black outlines was removed, although the upper edges still contrasted with his head. Mickey's eyes were later re-imagined as only consisting of the small black dots which were originally his pupils, while what were the upper edges of his eyes became a hairline. This is evident only when Mickey blinks. Fred Moore later redesigned the eyes to be small white eyes with pupils and gave his face a Caucasian skin tone instead of plain white. This new Mickey first appeared in 1938 {{on the cover of}} a party program, and in animation the following year with the release of The Pointer. Mickey is sometimes given eyebrows as seen in The Simple Things (1953) and in the comic strip, although he does not have eyebrows in his most recent appearances.|$|E
25|$|By {{separating}} Aleppo from Damascus, Gouraud {{wanted to}} capitalize on a traditional state of competition between the two cities {{and turn it into}} political division. The people in Aleppo were unhappy with the fact that Damascus was chosen as capital for the new nation of Syria. Gouraud sensed this sentiment and tried to manipulate it by making Aleppo the capital of a large and wealthier state with which it would have been hard for Damascus to compete. The State of Aleppo <b>as</b> <b>drawn</b> by France contained most of the fertile area of Syria: the fertile countryside of Aleppo in addition to the entire fertile basin of river Euphrates. The state also had access to sea via the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta. On the other hand, Damascus, which is basically an oasis on the fringes of the Syrian Desert, had neither enough fertile land nor access to sea. Basically, Gouraud wanted to lure Aleppo by giving it control over most of the agricultural and mineral wealth of Syria so that it would never want to unite with Damascus again.|$|E

These strong individual dashes do not seem painted so much <b>as</b> <b>drawn</b> onto the canvas with a heavily loaded brush.

Oldman was Nolan's first choice for Ra's al Ghul, but when Chris Cooper turned down the part of Gordon to spend time with his family Nolan decided that it would be {{refreshing}} for Oldman, who is renowned for his portrayals of villains, to play the role instead. [...] "I embody the themes of the movie which are the values of family, courage and compassion and a sense of right and wrong, good and bad and justice," [...] Oldman said of his character. He filmed most of his scenes in Britain. Goyer said Oldman heavily resembled Gordon <b>as</b> <b>drawn</b> by David Mazzucchelli in [...]|$|E
500|$|Simon concurred that Kirby {{had shown}} the {{original}} Spider-Man version to Lee, who {{liked the idea}} and assigned Kirby to draw sample pages of the new character but disliked the results—in Simon's description, [...] "Captain America with cobwebs". Writer Mark Evanier notes that Lee's reasoning that Kirby's character was too heroic seems unlikely—Kirby still drew the covers for Amazing Fantasy #15 and {{the first issue of}} The Amazing Spider-Man. Evanier also disputes Kirby's given reason that he was [...] "too busy" [...] to draw Spider-Man in addition to his other duties since Kirby was, said Evanier, [...] "always busy". Neither Lee's nor Kirby's explanation explains why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped; Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman, or one of his assistants, decided that Spider-Man <b>as</b> <b>drawn</b> and envisioned by Kirby was too similar to the Fly.|$|E

500|$|The wind flow {{around an}} extratropical cyclone is {{counterclockwise}} {{in the northern}} hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere, due to the Coriolis effect (this manner of rotation is generally referred to as cyclonic). Near this center, the pressure gradient force (from the pressure {{at the center of}} the cyclone compared to the pressure outside the cyclone) and the Coriolis force must be in an approximate balance for the cyclone to avoid collapsing in on itself as a result of the difference in pressure. The central pressure of the cyclone will lower with increasing maturity, while outside of the cyclone, the sea-level pressure is about average. In most extratropical cyclones, the part of the cold front ahead of the cyclone will develop into a warm front, giving the frontal zone (<b>as</b> <b>drawn</b> on surface weather maps) a wave-like shape. Due to their appearance on satellite images, extratropical cyclones can also be referred to as frontal waves early in their life cycle. In the United States, an old name for such a system is [...] "warm wave".|$|E
500|$|In 1911 Lasker {{received}} {{a challenge for}} a world title match against the rising star José Raúl Capablanca. Lasker was unwilling to play the traditional [...] "first to win ten games" [...] type of match in the semi-tropical conditions of Havana, especially <b>as</b> <b>drawn</b> games were becoming more frequent and the match might last for over six months. He therefore made a counter-proposal: if neither player had a lead {{of at least two}} games {{by the end of the}} match, it should be considered a draw; the match should be limited to the best of thirty games, counting draws; except that if either player won six games and led by at least two games before thirty games were completed, he should be declared the winner; the champion should decide the venue and stakes, and should have the exclusive right to publish the games; the challenger should deposit a forfeit of US $2,000 (equivalent to over $194,000 in 2006 values); the time limit should be twelve moves per hour; play should be limited to two sessions of 2½ hours each per day, five days a week. Capablanca objected to the time limit, the short playing times, the thirty-game limit, and especially the requirement that he must win by two games to claim the title, which he regarded as unfair. Lasker took offence at the terms in which Capablanca criticized the two-game lead condition and broke off negotiations, and until 1914 Lasker and Capablanca were not on speaking terms. However, at the 1914 St. Petersburg tournament, Capablanca proposed a set of rules for the conduct of World Championship matches, which were accepted by all the leading players, including Lasker.|$|E
