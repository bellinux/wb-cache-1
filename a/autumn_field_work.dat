40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{operator}} environment in the tractor cab. More precisely, the noise and dust in the tractor cab when stubbleng, plowing and sowing carried out under the <b>autumn</b> <b>field</b> <b>work.</b> Measurements were carried out in five farmers as five different tractors similar performance. As reference was used Zetor 12145, which was compared with New Holland T 6070 Tractor, Landini Powerfarm 100, 135 Zetor Fronterra and Deutz-Fahr M 620. The results of all measurements were graphically displayed and compared each other. In conclusion, the results were compared to measurements with the legislation. The measurement spat out of the rear tractor does not exceed the noise limit, which indicates the legislation. Dust measurements was more indicative of the diversity of the weather...|$|E

25|$|The primary {{function}} of the pusdalyvis is to indicate a simultaneous, but secondary action done by the sentence subject in nominative case (it must be matched according to gender and number with the said subject): Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuodami – We were doing the <b>field</b> <b>works</b> while singing. In this case the present padalyvis participle {{can be used as}} well: Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuojant, but this time the sentence will mean: We were doing the <b>field</b> <b>works</b> while someone else was singing. A secondary action done previously by the sentence subject can be expressed with adjectival past simple participle: Lauko darbus mes dirbome padainavę – We were doing the <b>field</b> <b>works</b> having sung. When used with the preposition prieš (before), pusdalyvis and padalyvis denote a secondary action in future: Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuodami. – We were doing the <b>field</b> <b>works</b> before singing. Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuojant. – We were doing the <b>field</b> <b>works</b> before someone else started to sing.|$|R

40|$|Our {{daily lives}} are {{increasingly}} dominated by new technology. 90 % of youngsters {{between the ages}} of 14 - 19 years use mobile phones and the internet several times a week and thus develop their own images of the world. A responsible school has to address this development as well as other current social developments. For geography education in particular, <b>field</b> <b>work</b> is considered beneficial in developing students’ spatial orientation. Experiencing the world “outside” extends many facts that one learns from the text book. Taking these preliminary considerations into account, this paper approaches tablet-based <b>field</b> <b>work</b> in geography classes by combining both beneficial and impeding factors of using technical devices in class. An example of tablet-based <b>field</b> <b>work</b> on a <b>field</b> trip to Berlin will be presented in order to show to what extent tablets can enhance geographic <b>field</b> <b>work...</b>|$|R
