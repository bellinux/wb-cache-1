40|$|In several circumstances, {{cooperation}} among autonomous agents {{is a prerequisite}} for e#ective or e#cient task processing. This stems from the inherent or transient asymmetry of the agents' resources and capabilities. Since agents process tasks autonomously, they have to decide by themselves under which conditions and to which means they cooperate. Such local decision making renders dedicated entities for resource management dispensable and, thus, may increase the system's fault-tolerance. In this report, we propose a framework for self-configuring resource management in cooperative and uncooperative environments. Therefore, we recognize the relatedness of <b>autonomous</b> agents and <b>economic</b> <b>entities.</b> Both are REMMs [1] and assess their resources and demands locally which leads to more e#ciency of the overall system. We identify and discuss two dimensions of autonomy, i. e. principal-agent and inter-agent autonomy. If all agents are part of the same organization, inter-agent autonomy gives way to cooperating agents. We elaborate distributed resource management for such cooperative systems. In case of inter-agent autonomy, uncooperative agent behavior is encouraged by their REMM nature. Yet, we show that the presented concept of resource management is seamlessly applicable to such an environment. Lastly, we identify discovery overlays as an efficient means of disseminating resource asymmetry awareness...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The role of <b>economic</b> <b>entities</b> in {{regional}} development {{is very important}} due to the multiple relationships that the <b>economic</b> <b>entity</b> has with all members affected by the business: creating jobs at regional level; supporting the activities performed by the <b>economic</b> <b>entity's</b> customers and suppliers; paying taxes to local authorities; providing support, {{in the form of}} donations and sponsorships, to local actions carried out at regional level. The <b>economic</b> <b>entity</b> must primarily be performing {{in order to have a}} sustainable activity. The most important indicators to measure the performance of an <b>economic</b> <b>entity</b> are the profitability indicators. This study aims to analyze the performance, at regional level, of the <b>economic</b> <b>entities</b> listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange based on three main rates of profitability measurement: return on profit, return on assets, and return on equity.
