The spatial and temporal mapping algorithms were originally developed through research at the University of Central Florida, funded by NASA s Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM), where the goal was to merge National Weather Service (NWS) Next-Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) volume reflectivity data with drop size distribution data acquired from a cluster of raindrop disdrometers. In this current work, we adapted these algorithms to process data from a cluster of hail disdrometers positioned around Launch Pads 39 A or 39 B, along with the corresponding NWS radar data. Radar data from all NWS NEXRAD sites is archived at the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). That data can be readily accessed at. 3 DRadPlot plots Level III reflectivity data at four scan elevations (this software is <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>Open</b> Channel Software,). By using spatial and temporal interpolation/extrapolation based on hydrometeor fall dynamics, we can merge the hail disdrometer array data coupled with local Weather Surveillance Radar- 1988, Doppler (WSR- 88 D) radial velocity and reflectivity data into a 4 -D (3 -D space and time) picture of hail size distributions. Hail flux maps can then be generated and used for damage prediction and assessment over specific surfaces corresponding to structures within the disdrometer array volume. Immediately following a hail storm, specific damage areas and degree of damage can be identified for inspection crews...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on very {{efficient}} algorithms for the spherical harmonic transform (SHT). Explicitly vectorized variations of the algorithm based on the Gauss-Legendre quadrature are discussed and implemented in the SHTns library which includes scalar and vector transforms. The main breakthrough is to achieve very efficient on-the-fly computations of the Legendre associated functions, even for very high resolutions, {{by taking advantage of}} the specific properties of the SHT and the advanced capabilities of current and future computers. This allows us to simultaneously and significantly reduce memory usage and computation time of the SHT. We measure the performance and accuracy of our algorithms. Even though the complexity of the algorithms implemented in SHTns are in $O(N^ 3) $ (where N is the maximum harmonic degree of the transform), they perform much better than any third party implementation, including lower complexity algorithms, even for truncations as high as N= 1023.

40|$|The multi-TeV {{energies}} <b>available</b> <b>at</b> LHC have <b>opened</b> up {{the possibility}} to measure, for the first time, various large-mass elementary particles in nuclear collisions. The current study presents the first observation of top quark [...] the heaviest elementary particle in the standard model [...] using proton-lead collisions. The measurement {{is based on a}} data set whose integrated luminosity amounts to 174 nb^- 1, as recorded by CMS at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 8. 16 TeV. The pair production process is measured using events with exactly one isolated lepton, electron or muon, and at least four jets, leading to a cross section of 45 ± 8 nb. This is well compatible with theoretical predictions from perturbative quantum chromodynamics at next-to-next-to-leading order with soft gluon resummation at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.

In both articles, the authors first characterized the functional properties of a small subset of cells, and then manually traced {{a subset of the}} processes emanating from those cells to obtain a partial subgraph. In alignment with the principles of open-science, the authors of Bock et al. (2011) have released their data for public access. The full resolution 12TB dataset from Bock et al. is <b>available</b> <b>at</b> the <b>Open</b> Connectome Project.

Scaling up ultrastructural circuit mapping to the whole mouse brain is currently underway (Mikula, 2012). An alternative approach to mapping connectivity was recently proposed by Zador and colleagues (Zador et al., 2012). Zador's technique, called BOINC (barcoding of individual neuronal connections) uses high-throughput sequencing to map neural circuits. Briefly, the approach consists of (1) labelling each neuron with a unique DNA barcode; (2) transferring barcodes between synaptically coupled neurons (for example using PRV); and (3) fusion of barcodes to represent a synaptic pair. This approach {{has the potential to be}} cheap, fast, and extremely high-throughput.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Near-infrared imaging {{surveys of}} high-mass star-forming regions reveal an amazingly complex interplay between star {{formation}} {{and the environment}} (Churchwell et al. 2006; Alvarez et al. 2004). By means of near-IR spectroscopy the embedded massive young stars can be characterized {{and placed in the}} context of their birth site. However, so far spectroscopic surveys have been hopelessly incomplete, hampering any systematic study of these very young massive stars. New integral field instrumentation <b>available</b> <b>at</b> ESO has <b>opened</b> the possibility to take a huge step forward by obtaining a full spectral inventory of the youngest massive stellar populations in star-forming regions currently accessible. Simultaneously, the analysis of the extended emission allows the characterization of the environmental conditions. The Formation and Early Evolution of Massive Stars (FEMS) collaboration aims at setting up a large observing campaign to obtain a full census of the stellar content, ionized material, outflows and PDR’s over a sample of regions that cover a large parameter space.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{wildfire}} behaviors of increasing relevance that {{are outside the}} forecast capabilities {{of even the most}} sophisticated operational fire spread and fire behavior model. The limitations of the operational models are due primarily to their inability to represent coupled fire-atmosphere interactions. Coupled wildfire-atmosphere models are physics-based fluid-dynamical prognostic models of wildfire spread and behavior that attempt an almost complete representation of fire-atmosphere interactions. This level of fidelity however means that these models cannot be used operationally. The reason is that, despite ever increasing computational resources, the complexity and range of processes and scales (1 mm to 100 km) involved in this modeling approach make computational costs prohibitively expensive. In this study we propose an intermediate approach. A physics-based coupled atmosphere-fire model is used to resolve the large-scale and local weather as well as the atmosphere-fire interactions, while combustion is represented simply using an existing operational surface fire behavior model. This model combination strikes a balance between fidelity and speed of execution. The feasibility of this approach is examined based on an analysis of a numerical simulation of two very large Santa Ana fires using WRF-Sfire, a coupled atmosphere-fire model <b>available</b> <b>at</b> the <b>Open</b> Wildland Fire Modeling Community (OpenWFM. org); an earlier version is available as WRF-Fire in WRF release.
