But, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> {{while we}} have agreed on the two payments, I reserve the right of {{deciding}} what share your daughter and Drayton are to have, within the limits sketched out. I can't fix it definitely until I've seen the timber--you'll have to trust me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tight beds of geranium, calceolaria, and lobelia {{speckled}} the glass-plat, from whose centre rose one of {{the finest}} araucarias (its other name by the way is [...] "monkey-puzzler"), that it has ever been my lot to see. It must have been full thirty feet high, and its foliage exquisitely answered the iron railings.

6000|$|But {{the nature}} of Mr. [...] "Commissioner" [...] Booth-Clibborn's conceptions of straightforwardness and good faith is so marvellously {{illustrated}} by the portions of his letter with which I have dealt that I doubt not his statements are quite up {{to the level of}} the [...] "Army" [...] Regulations and Instructions in regard to those cardinal virtues. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> must be the case, the slave is subdued to that he works in.|$|E

6000|$|... [158] President Wilson {{was mistaken}} in {{suggesting}} that the supervision of Reparation payments has been entrusted to the League of Nations. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> in Chapter V., whereas the League is invoked in regard {{to most of the}} continuing economic and territorial provisions of the Treaty, {{this is not the case}} as regards Reparation, over the problems and modifications of which the Reparation Commission is supreme without appeal of any kind to the League of Nations.|$|E
60|$|But, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to him, {{it really}} didn't matter whom Robina blamed. We talked about women {{generally}} {{on our way}} back. I told him--impressing upon him {{there was no need}} for it to go farther--that I personally had come to the conclusion that the best way to deal with women was to treat them all as children. He agreed it might be a good method, but wanted to know what you did when they treated you as a child.|$|E

"You will understand, sir," [...] he concluded, [...] "that {{a scheme}} such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{could only be}} carried through if {{the whole of the}} {{property}} were in one person's hands.

6000|$|... "What I {{complain}} of," [...] {{the professor}} began, speaking with elaborate and impressive slowness, [...] "is that my performance is hurried over and that too long a time {{is taken up}} by Beatrice's songs. The management remark upon the applause which her efforts occasionally ensure, but, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> would <b>point</b> <b>out</b> to you, sir," [...] he continued, [...] "a performance such as mine makes too deep an impression for the audience to show their appreciation of it by such vulgar methods as hand-clapping and whistling.

6000|$|Allonby swayed {{a trifle}} on his feet, but the gleam {{in his eyes}} grew brighter. [...] "You," [...] he said, [...] "are, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> curiously {{deficient}} in comprehension, but you never won a case of medals that were coveted by the keenest brains among all those who hoped to enter your profession. Of what use are dollars to a whisky-tank who will, in all probability, be found mangled {{at the bottom of}} the shaft one day? Still, when I made the calculations we are now working on, there was no man in the province with a knowledge equal to mine, and I ask no more than to prove them right." ...|$|E
60|$|Ada {{seemed very}} happy in her new {{character}} as Viscountess Holmeskirk. The first winter after she was married, she sent me a very pressing invitation {{to go up and}} spend a few weeks with her: but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to her in my reply, it would be unpleasant to all parties, for Lady Desborough could not come to her house the whole time I was there; at any rate that if she did, I certainly could not meet her: so that it was really better I should not come, as I could not possibly feel at ease, and, in any case, I should not have cared for entering into the gaieties of London life.|$|E
6000|$|But {{among other}} things, I {{remember}} that I showed him no mercy at the outset. At one time I was indignant; at another I was scornful. I declared, {{in regard to}} my object in meeting him, that I had changed my mind, And had decided to shorten a disagreeable interview by waiving my right to an explanation, and bidding him farewell. Eunice, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> had the first claim to him; Eunice was {{much more likely to}} suit him, as a companion for life, than I was. [...] "In short," [...] I said, in conclusion, [...] "my inclination for once takes sides with my duty, and leaves my sister in undisturbed possession of young Mr. Dunboyne."

40|$|I will be {{describing}} {{an acoustic}} emission {{program at the}} National Bureau of Standards sponsored jointly by NBS and the Electric Power Research Institute. This {{is part of a}} larger comprehensive NDE program at NBS. The acoustic emission program uses the spectral analysis approach for the characterization of moving defects and, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> will <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> includes the development of an acoustic emission transducer calibration facility as well as the experimental study of crack motion in glass and pressure vessel steels. These require a quantitative theory which serves to guide the experimental design as well as to interpret the results...|$|R
60|$|We rose early, {{and taking}} the {{necessary}} precautions, bathed in the pool. Then we breakfasted, and having filled every available receptacle with water, which took us a long time as these included a large tank that supplied the bath, so {{that we might have}} at least a week's supply in case of siege, we went on deck and debated what we should do. In the end we determined to stop where we were and await events, because, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> it was necessary that we should discover whether these natives were hostile or friendly. In the former event we could hold our own on the ship, whereas away from it we must be overwhelmed; in the latter there was always time to move inland.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Deringham, with {{a little}} smile that seemed to {{indicate}} that the point was not important, [...] "that brings us to his other motive, which displays a very creditable feeling. Tristan Alton, as you know, only relented upon his deathbed, when, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to our kinsman, his senses were, in the opinion even of those who signed his will, a trifle clouded, and Alton was reluctant to profit by a half-delirious fancy which deprived us, or to be more literal, you, of what was virtually your own. As I told him no man in the possession of all his wits would have made such a will, and there was a probability that it could he successfully contested." ...|$|E
6000|$|Some {{time ago}} I ventured to defend that race of hunted and persecuted outlaws, the Bishops; but until this week I {{had no idea}} of how much persecuted they were. For instance, the Bishop of Birmingham made some {{extremely}} sensible remarks in the House of Lords, to the effect that Oxford and Cambridge were (as everybody knows they are) far too much merely plutocratic playgrounds. One would have thought that an Anglican Bishop might be allowed to know something about the English University system, and even to have, if anything, some bias in its favour. But (<b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out)</b> the rollicking Radicalism of Bishops has to be restrained. The man who writes the notes in the weekly paper called the Outlook feels that it is his business to restrain it. The passage has such simple sublimity that I must quote it-- ...|$|E
40|$|When {{displayed}} in museum cabinets, tactile objects {{that were once}} used {{in the education of}} blind and visually impaired people, appear to us, sighted visitors, as anything but tactile. We cannot touch them due to museum policies and we can hardly imagine what it would have been like for a blind person to touch them in their historical context. And yet these objects are all about touch, from the concrete act of touching something to the norms that assigned touch a specific pedagogical role in nineteenth-century blind schools. The aim of this article is twofold. First, I provide a historical background to the tactile objects of the blind. When did they appear as a specific category of pedagogical aid and how did they help determine the relation between blindness, vision, and touch? Second, I address the tactile objects {{from the point of view}} of empirical sources and historical evidence. Material objects are rarely used as historical testimonies for the simple reason that they, unlike archival material, do not present historians with written documents that can be held as evidence of the past. However, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> certain historical questions of which archives remain silent could be approached by other means such as the use of material objects. Rather than delivering concrete methodological suggestions, this second part reflects upon the historical use of material objects - both their possibilities and their limits - within the context of blindness...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beloved brethren, {{that we may}} be spotlessly moral, {{before all}} things let us lie," [...] is the sum total of many an exhortation {{addressed}} to the [...] "Infidel." [...] Now, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have already <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> we cannot oblige our exhorters. We leave the practical application of the convenient doctrines of [...] "Reserve" [...] and [...] "Non-natural interpretation" [...] to those who invented them.|$|R
40|$|In the Discourse on Metaphysics Leibniz {{put forward}} his famous complete-concept {{definition}} of substance. Sometimes this definition is glossed as stating that a substance is an entity with a concept so complete that it contains all its predicates, {{and it is}} thought that it follows directly from Leibniz’s theory of truth. Now, an adequate definition of substance should not apply to accidents. But, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> if Leibniz’s theory of truth is correct then an accident is an entity with a concept so complete that it contains all its predicates. The aim {{of this paper is to}} clarify Leibniz’s notion of substance in the Discourse with a view to explaining how that definition successfully distinguishes between substances and accidents...|$|R
60|$|We entered, and I {{put before}} him my notions--such {{of them as}} I felt he would approve. We were some time about the business, and when we looked at our watches young Bute's last train to town had gone. There still {{remained}} much to talk about, and I suggested he should return {{with me to the}} cottage and take his luck. I could sleep with Dick and he could have my room. I told him about the cow, but he said he was a practised sleeper and would be delighted, if I could lend him a night-shirt, and if I thought Miss Robina would not be put out. I assured him {{that it would be a}} good thing for Robina; the unexpected guest would be a useful lesson to her in housekeeping. Besides, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to him, it didn't really matter even if Robina were put out.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{hands were}} at work next day in {{repairing}} damages. I was up aloft seeing to the fitting of fresh gear to the topgallant-mast when I saw something floating at sea which took my attention. It seemed {{to me like a}} box, and an empty one, for it floated high on the water. Its lid seemed to be open, and I thought once or twice that I saw something inside. I slid down to the quarter-deck and reported what I had seen. The third lieutenant, who was doing duty with his arm in a sling, was not disposed to take the men off their work to lower a boat; but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the box might have belonged to the merchantman which had been burned overnight, and that it might afford some clew as to the name of the ship, he consented, and with four hands I was soon rowing towards the box.|$|E
60|$|On they came, {{the girls}} with the platters walking ahead. On {{one of these}} were what looked like joints of baked pork, on another some plantains and pear-shaped fruits. They knelt down and offered these to us. We {{contemplated}} them for a while. Then Bickley {{shook his head and}} began to rub his stomach with appropriate contortions. Clearly they were quick-minded enough for they saw the point. At some words the girls brought the platters to the chief and others, who took from them portions of the food at hazard and ate them to show that it was not poisoned, we watching their throats the while {{to make sure that it}} was swallowed. Then they returned again and we took some of the food though only Bickley ate, because, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to him, being a doctor who understood the use of antidotes; clearly he should make the experiment. However, nothing happened; indeed he said that it was very good.|$|E
40|$|In a multi-disciplinary {{discussion}} that includes major contribution from sociology, economics, environmental sciences, ecophilosophy and management theory, I outline transitions towards, and {{the style and}} practice of eco-sensitive management. Eco-sensitivity means the presence of eco-centric values together {{with the ability to}} put these into practice. The argument proceeds in two sections. In the first the deep roots of industrial exploitation of the natural world are established. In chapter one industrial capitalism is discussed while chapter two outlines the moves towards what I have called 're-organised capitalism'. As is <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> in chapter three, whilst both systems involve exploitation of the natural world, there are indications within re-organised capitalism of an opportunity to 'turn around' the juggernaut of exploitative expansionary capitalism and adopt more eco-sensitive approaches. Business organisations, now entering a period of yet greater influence on world affairs, are a key to this, but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> in chapter four, in striving to become more eco-sensitive they must deal with the complex structures of the natural world, a point made by an examination of biodiversity. In the second section the shape of eco-sensitive management is outlined. In chapter five important transitions in the 'world view' of organisations are discussed; they must become less anthropocentric, adopt holistic thinking practices and use the notion of 'risk for nature' instead of financial risk. They will also use 'new science' and ecological economics, sets of ideas developed and discussed in chapter six. Incrementalist and learning based models of strategic planning and an eco-centred scenario based planning style that is used in conjunction with systems thinking are discussed in chapters seven and eight. An organisation structure suitable for eco-organisations and an eco-leadership style are elaborated on in chapter nine...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{connection}} between Shakespeare’s Macbeth and the famous English witch trial {{which took place in}} Lancashire in 1612. The judicial proceeding was recorded by a clerk of the court, who went by the name of Thomas Potts, whose reportage of the events was inconsistent and unstable, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> attempt to <b>point</b> <b>out.</b> In so doing, I underline the reasons – political, religious and opportunistic – that possibly motivated his behaviour, highly criticisable by modern standards...|$|R
5000|$|Despite the case, {{doctrine}} can {{be based}} on an implication from the text or structure of the Constitution. Sir Owen Dixon, in particular, was critical of any such overblown reading of the Engineers case in this oft-quoted passage: [...] "The prima-facie rule is that a power to legislate {{with respect to a}} given subject enables the Parliament to make laws which, upon that subject, affect the operations of the States and their agencies. That, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> more than once, is the effect of the Engineers case stripped of embellishment and reduced to the form of a legal proposition." [...] Earlier, he had written: [...] "We should avoid pedantic and narrow constructions in dealing with an instrument of government and I do not see why we should be fearful about making implications." ...|$|R
