Experimental approaches usually measure the sense of agency by judgments or verbal reports, despite evidence that the sense of agency is not sufficiently assessed on such a reflective level. Here we sought to identify non-verbal measures of the sense of agency, particularly testing the relevance of physiological activity such as skin conductance and heart rate. Manipulating the visual feedback to an executed movement, we investigated how well physiological activity and other movement parameters differed between real and false feedback (i. e., between <b>actual</b> <b>agency</b> and non-agency), and how they related to accuracy of agency judgments. Skin conductance and heart rate did not differ between agency and non-agency situations; neither did they inform agency judgments. In contrast, movement onsets – particularly, discrepancies between feedback and movement onsets – were related to agency judgments. Overall, our results indicate weak visceral–somatic associations with the sense of agency. Thus, physiological activity did not prove to be an empirical indicator for the feeling of agency...|$|R

As he remarks, “The true value of this study, therefore, lies in its painstaking elucidation of an intrinsically fascinating subculture which helped colour rather than cause aspects of Nazism. In this context, it also leaves us pondering a central issue: why on earth were Austrian and German occultists, just like the Nazi leadership, quite so susceptible to, indeed obsessed by, specifically aggressive racist beliefs anyway?” Noakes continues this general thought by concluding, “ (Goodrick-Clarke) provides not only a definitive account {{of the influence of}} Ariosophy on Nazism, a subject which is prone to sensationalism, but also fascinating insights into the intellectual climate of {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth century.” These reviews reflect the greatest dilemmas in Nazi Occultist scholarship; the discernment between actual efficacy of possible Occult practices by Nazi leaders, purpose of these practices, and modern notions and applications of Occultism today largely impact the appropriate scholarship in general in making connections between plausible Nazi Ariosophic practices and blatant popular myth.|$|R

CHCOs reported using the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Federal Executive Institute and the Harvard Kennedy School of Government most often. Agencies are required to maintain records of training plans, expenditures, activities, and (since 2006) to report training data to OPM. However, half of the CHCOs reported data to GAO that they deemed incomplete, or with limitations. For example, two agencies did not include travel related costs; one did not include costs for course materials; another did not include costs from all components. OPM officials agree that training cost data reported by agencies continues to be unreliable, and is probably lower than <b>actual</b> <b>agency</b> expenditures. OPM officials said they are meeting with agencies to address data deficiencies. However, OPM has not set interim milestones for meeting with agencies or established a timeframe to improve reporting.

By not establishing interim milestones and timeframes for improving the reliability of executive training cost data, OPM may be missing an opportunity to better position itself to hold agencies accountable for improving their data. ...|$|R

The analysis uses data for the year 2010 for five indicators. For each indicator, the value or rank of each of the four countries is compared with the average score for all developing countries for which data is available for a particular index. Also for comparison, the values will be shown for 12 neighboring developing countries. The reference group of developing countries consists of all low and medium income countries (126 countries). The five indices are part of the database Indices of Social Development (www. indsocdev. org). The scale is a 100 -point scale, from 0 (low score) to 100 (high score). The objective of this comparative analysis is to give a picture of how the four selected countries score relative to other developing countries. For this, the analysis has two levels. The first level concerns predispositions of countries towards civil society agency. This may be regarded as inherent cultural and social values and attitudes in civil society. This includes the following three indices: - Interpersonal Safety and Trust (IST) - Inclusion of Minorities (IM) - Intergroup Cohesion (IC) The second level of the analysis concerns actual civil society behaviour, that is, the <b>actual</b> <b>agency</b> expressed in civil society.

40|$|Surveys {{on the use}} {{of agency}} credit ratings reveal that some investors believe that credit-rating {{agencies}} are relatively slow in adjusting their ratings. A well-accepted explanation for this perception on rating timeliness is the through-the-cycle methodology that agencies use. Through-the-cycle ratings are intended to measure default risk over long investment horizons and to respond only to changes in the permanent component of credit quality. A second aspect of the through-the-cycle methodology is the prudent migration policy. In a benchmark study with a financial ratio-based credit-scoring models - an agency-rating prediction model and default-prediction models with various time horizons - we confirm the exclusive focus of agencies on the permanent component of credit quality and we model and quantify the agencies' prudent migration policy. A rating migration is triggered only when the rating predicted by the agency-rating prediction model differs by at least a threshold level of 1. 8 notch steps from the <b>actual</b> <b>agency</b> rating. If triggered, ratings are only partly adjusted by 70 per cent at the downside and 60 per cent at the upside. From a 1 -year point-in-time perspective, weighting temporary fluctuations in credit quality, the through-the-cycle methodology lowers the rating-migration probability by a factor of 3. 5. Both aspects of the through-the-cycle methodology contribute equally to this factor. The partial adjustment of ratings lowers the rating-reversal probabilities on short term and introduces rating drift, the known serial correlation in agency-rating migrations. © Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA, 2005...|$|R

Natural selection having been compared with artificial selection, and the analogy pointed out, there apparently remains no indefiniteness: the inconvenience being, however, that the definiteness is of a wrong kind. The tacitly implied Nature which selects, is not an embodied agency analogous to the man who selects artificially; and the selection is not the picking out of an individual fixed on, but the overthrowing of many individuals by agencies which one successfully resists, and hence continues to live and multiply.

We investigate residents’ experiences with the “Speck” particulate matter sensor with an emerging environmental health resource center called the Southwest Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project (EHP). In response to the gaps in knowledge about the health impacts of UNGD and the growth citizen science tools, participatory environmental monitoring (PEM) projects have taken off in shale gas communities. Using interview and survey data from residents, advocates, and activists we show that residents use the Speck as: 1) “environmental health thermometers” to make real time decisions based on readings; 2) real-time tools of exposure-validation to immediately validate or invalidate suspicions of exposure; 3) “epistemic objects” or tools manipulated in exploratory ways to understand their efficacy in monitoring UNGD; and 4) passively by those who chose to rarely interact with the monitors and rather waited for overall analysis of results. While PEM’s have been critiqued for potentially passing the burden of monitoring onto communities, our research shows PEM, when connected with research and public health organizations like EHP, can both empower individuals by increasing their perceived and <b>actual</b> <b>agency</b> and build collective knowledge by producing novel scientific findings. The modes of participation identified here each imply individual and community-level outcomes.

40|$|Surveys {{on the use}} {{of agency}} credit ratings reveal that some investors believe that rating {{agencies}} are relatively slow in adjusting their ratings. A well-accepted explanation for this perception on the timeliness of ratings is the "through-the-cycle" methodology that agencies use. According to Moody's, through-the-cycle ratings are stable because they are intended to measure the risk of default risk over long investment horizons, and because they are changed only when agencies are confident that observed changes in a company's risk profile are likely to be permanent. To verify this explanation, we quantify the impact of the long-term default horizon and the prudent migration policy on rating stability from the perspective of an investor - with no desire for rating stability. This is done by benchmarking agency ratings with a financial ratio-based (credit scoring) agency-rating prediction model and (credit scoring) default-prediction models of various time horizons. We also examine rating migration practices. Final result is a better quantitative understanding of the through-the-cycle methodology. By varying the time horizon in the estimation of default-prediction models, we search for a best match with the agency-rating prediction model. Consistent with the agencies' stated objectives, we conclude that agency ratings are focused on the long term. In contrast to one-year default prediction models, agency ratings place less weight on short-term indicators of credit quality. We also demonstrate that the focus of agencies on long investment horizons explains only part of the relative stability of agency ratings. The other aspect of through-the-cycle rating methodology - agency rating-migration policy - is an even more important factor underlying the stability of agency ratings. We find that rating migrations are triggered when the difference between the <b>actual</b> <b>agency</b> rating and the model predicted rating exceeds a certain threshold level. When rating migrations are triggered, agencies adjust their ratings only partially, consistent with the known serial dependency of agency rating migrations. ...|$|R

A clearer test, however, involves cases where clear policy statements are coupled with sub-stantial levels of funding. The Environmental Studies Program (ESP) of the U. S.

The program, which is explicitly required to study impacts of offshore development on "the human, marine, and coastal environments, " has spent roughly $ 500 million on such studies over the past two decades.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} agency and positioning of cultural workers in the restructuring of contemporary cities. This positioning is ambiguous. Cultural workers often lead precarious professional lives, yet their significant symbolic and cultural capital is widely mobilised {{in the service of}} neoliberal urban restructuring, including ‘creative city’ flagship developments and gentrification. But cultural workers’ <b>actual</b> <b>agency,</b> their reactions to urban processes that exploit their presence, and their relations to other urban social groups, are poorly understood and hard to decipher. This thesis addresses these issues through three articles. Paper I examines a process of artist-led gentrification ongoing in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York. It shows that artists, gallerists {{and other members of the}} local art scene contribute to sustaining gentrification through their everyday practices and discourses. The gentrification frontier is constructed on an everyday level as a transitional space and time in the scene members’ lives. Gentrification is de-politicised by discursively underplaying its conflictual components of class and racial struggle. Forms of resistance to gentrification amongst scene members are found, but they appear to be sector-specific and exclusive. Finally, scene members tend to fail at establishing meaningful relationships with long-time residents. Paper II brings the perspectives of long-time residents in Bushwick to the forefront. Examination of the emotional and affectual components of displacement reveals that these aspects are as important as material re-location to understanding displacement and gentrification. The encounter with newcomers’ bodies in neighbourhood spaces triggers a deep sense of displacement for long-time residents, evoking deep-rooted structural inequalities of which gentrification is one spatial expression. Paper III examines the case of Macao, a collective mobilisation of cultural workers in Milan, Italy. There, cultural workers have mobilised against neoliberal urbanism, top-down gentrification, corruption, growing labour precarity and other regressive urban and social issues. The paper considers the distinctive resources, aesthetic tactics and inaugurative practices mobilised and enacted in the urban space by Macao and it argues that by deploying their cultural and symbolic capital, cultural workers can reframe the relations between bodies, space and time, and hence challenge power structures. Cultural workers might not have the power to determine the structural boundaries and hierarchies that organize urban society, including their own positioning in it. Nonetheless, through their actions and discourses and subjectification processes, they can reinforce or challenge those borders. ...|$|R
