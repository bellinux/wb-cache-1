40|$|Abstract: Aided Education, {{as a way}} of training, is one of {{the areas}} in which {{information}} technology has a major contribution to increasing efficiency of education process. The success of which have enjoyed and will enjoy the e-Learning applications is due to new perspectives that open the computer and the Internet in education process. Interactive lessons are characterized by great impact, which they have in the learning process, but also by teaching and technical complexity. It can assume that soon libraries will become virtual libraries (the content of the libraries will be distributed worldwide), the learners will buy from a global university offer on the Internet and other communications media will be able to carry out programs and to learn autonomously. AN ORIGINALLY WAY TO CUT A GLASS If you happen to break a bottle of wine or water, we can remove by cutting the part of the glass which is flawed and to obtain thus a fine vessel using the method which we describe in the following. Wewill fill the bottle with oil up to the height we want that the bottle to be cut smoothly. The bottle must be placed on a perfectly horizontal table. Then we heat very long time one end of an iron ant we will put it suddenly into the bottle. We will hear <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> will find that the glass was cut at the surface of the liquid. If we get in different halfs quantities of oil and we do every time as shown above we can get the glass rings. These rings can be used as supports for table napkins, in case we used a smaller bottle...|$|E
40|$|The organ {{has been}} called "the monster which never breathes, " but perhaps its breaths are simply very long and deep. In Charlemagne Palestine's perambulations through the organ's sonic landscape, this is {{certainly}} the case—the breath is some 70 minutes long. Schlingen-Blängen was first realized in Holland in 1979, although it had several precursors. Composer-performer Palestine had become well known in avant-garde circles in New York and Europe and was often seen and heard at major festivals. Usually, the instrument of his long, environmental, quasi-sacred musical inventions was the Imperiale Grand Bösendorfer piano. The alchemical magic of dancing harmonics which he managed to coax out of this magnificent instrument through sheer physical will (indeed the physicality of a Palestine performance was memorable—a battle of wills with the piano itself) transformed both physical space and imaginary space inside the listeners' heads. Those who have experienced a Charlemagne Palestine Bösendorfer performance such as Strumming Music, or Lower Depths or Timbral Assault (see discography) usually have found the relentless coaxing of sound from the piano to be a physical ballet {{as well as a}} spiritual-musico exercise. So the idea of creating a new sound world through the resources of an old tracker Baroque organ seemed quite a different tack to take. The physicality of the performance would be less present, more implied in the overwhelming acoustics of the space than in the movements of the keyboard performer. In Schlingen-Blängen the arms and torso of Palestine take <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> experience sounds set into motion by the initial choosing of a chord and its timbres (the setting of the registers or stops); the melodic changes that occur are subtle and few. The resultant torrent of sound, which begins as a trickle, might delude the listener into a visual hallucination of the ever-active composer somehow hammering away at keys and pedals, but such is not the case. This very unpalpable acoustic experience seems unusual for this composer. Yet Palestine had worked with disembodied organ sonority before, in fact well before h...|$|E
40|$|We report our {{discovery}} and early time optical, near-infrared, and radio wavelength follow-up {{observations of the}} afterglow of the gamma-ray burst GRB 021211. Our optical observations, beginning 21 min after the burst trigger, demonstrate that the early afterglow of this burst is roughly three magnitudes fainter than the afterglow of GRB 990123 at similar epochs, and fainter than almost all known afterglows at an epoch of 1 d after the GRB. Our near-infrared and optical observations indicate {{that this is not}} due to extinction. Combining our observations with data reported by other groups, we identify the signature of a reverse shock. This reverse shock is not detected to a 3 -sigma limit of 110 uJy in an 8. 46 -GHz VLA observation at t= 0. 10 d, implying either that the Lorentz factor of the burst gamma ~ 1 week, we find that the late-time radio flux is suppressed by a factor of two relative to the >~ 80 uJy peak flux at optical wavelengths. This suppression {{is not likely to be}} due to synchrotron self-absorption or <b>an</b> early jet <b>break,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> suggest instead that the burst may have suffered substantial radiative corrections...|$|R
60|$|Drama is {{the poetry}} of conduct, romance {{the poetry of}} circumstance. The {{pleasure}} that we take in life is of two sorts--the active and the passive. Now we are conscious of a great command over our destiny; anon we are lifted up by circumstance, as by <b>a</b> <b>breaking</b> wave, <b>and</b> dashed <b>we</b> know not how into the future. Now we are pleased by our conduct, anon merely pleased by our surroundings. It {{would be hard to}} say which of these modes of satisfaction is the more effective, but the latter is surely the more constant. Conduct is three parts of life, they say; but I think they put it high. There is a vast deal in life and letters both which is not immoral, but simply non-moral; which either does not regard the human will at all, or deals with it in obvious and healthy relations; where the interest turns, not upon what a man shall choose to do, but on how he manages to do it; not on the passionate slips and hesitations of the conscience, but on the problems of the body and of the practical intelligence, in clean, open-air adventure, the shock of arms, or the diplomacy of life. With such material as this it is impossible to build a play, for the serious theatre exists solely on moral grounds, and is a standing proof of the dissemination of the human conscience. But it is possible to build, upon this ground, the most joyous of verses, and the most lively, beautiful, and buoyant tales.|$|R
