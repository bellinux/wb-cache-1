Moreover, there are not sufficient studies that examine the behavior of granular material under unsaturated conditions, although such conditions are very prevalent in pavement structures. In this research, an attempt is made to determine the cyclic plastic deformation characteristics of unsaturated granular <b>base</b> <b>course</b> material, and to {{examine the effect of}} the rotation of the principal stress axis (experienced by pavement elements under traffic loads) on the mechanical behavior of unsaturated granular <b>base</b> <b>course</b> material by applying various loading methods. A series of laboratory element tests using a multi-ring shear apparatus, which can take into account the rotation of the principal stress axis, were carried out on granular <b>base</b> <b>course</b> material under different moisture contents. The experimental results show that the moisture content has an obvious effect on both the shear behavior and the cyclic plastic deformation of granular <b>base</b> <b>course</b> material. However, the moisture content for the maximum deformation of granular <b>base</b> <b>course</b> material varies according to the loading method. It is also explained that cyclic plastic deformation considerably increases due to the rotation of the principal stress axis under repeated axial and shear loading tests. Therefore, the principal stress axis rotation has a significant influence on the cyclic plastic deformation of unsaturated granular <b>base</b> <b>course</b> material...|$|R

40|$|Increasing the HMA base {{thickness}} and {{modifying the}} HMA mixture properties {{to improve the}} resistance to fatigue cracking {{are among the most}} popular methods for achieving long-lasting pavements. Such methods are based on the idea of reducing the tensile strain {{at the bottom of the}} HMA layer below the Fatigue Endurance Limit (FEL), a level of strain below which no cumulative damage occurs to the HMA mixture. This study investigates the effectiveness of several design strategies involved in long-life, perpetual pavement design. A 3 D Finite Element model of the pavement involving a linear viscoelastic constitutive model for HMA materials and non-uniform tire contact stresses is developed using ABAQUS 6. 11. The effects of asphalt <b>base</b> <b>course</b> thickness and mixture type, rich binder layer, and aggregate subbase layer are examined. Four asphalt <b>base</b> <b>course</b> mixture types, namely dense graded, polymer modified, high modulus, and standard binder, are studied as a function of the asphalt <b>base</b> <b>course</b> thickness. The results underline a better performance of the high-modulus asphalt base, as compared to the other <b>base</b> <b>course</b> mixtures. The aggregate subbase layer on top of subgrade soil showed a relatively minor effect on the longitudinal and lateral strain response at the bottom of asphalt <b>base</b> <b>course.</b> The addition of a rich binder layer at the bottom of the asphalt <b>base</b> <b>course</b> showed a significant reduction in tensile strains.

The weak sand subgrades are prepared at 30 % relative density (RD) through pluviation (sand raining) technique in a test tank of dimensions 1 m × 1 m × 1 m (length × width × height). Two different <b>base</b> <b>courses</b> consisting of 75 % RD sand and a granular base material have been tested. The 75 % RD sand <b>base</b> <b>course</b> is also prepared by pluviation technique, while the granular <b>base</b> <b>course</b> is prepared in 5 layers, each of 50 mm thick, by static compaction. A repetitive load of 0. 97 kN and 9. 7 kN was applied on the prepared base layer through a 150 mm diameter plate to replicate the traffic load equivalent to a contact pressure of 550 kPa. Loading was applied through a graphical user interfaced multi-purpose test software along {{with the help of}} a hydraulic power unit, hydraulic service manifold and sophisticated double acting linear dynamic 100 kN capacity actuator which is connected to a 3. 5 m high, 200 kN capacity reaction frame. Four different tests are conducted on both the <b>base</b> <b>courses</b> (75 % RD sand and granular base) with and without reinforcement overlying the weak sand subgrade separately.
