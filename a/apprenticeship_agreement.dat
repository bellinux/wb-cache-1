40|$|Until {{comparatively}} recently, most {{training in}} most countries has been enterprise-based and has been financed by the employer, by the trainee, or both jointly, normally without money changing hands. As a first approximation, the cost of firm-specific training is absorbed by the employer, {{and the cost of}} transferable training is shifted to the trainee by means of a reduction in his wages, often within the framework of an <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>agreement.</b> This report examines the rationale for this division of the burden and the way that it may be modified in certain circumstances. It examines the arguments for the subsidization of training from public funds. The case can be made under four headings: market failure; externalities; equity considerations; and social considerations. It reviews experience with the various types of subsidy schemes that have been implemented {{in different parts of the}} world. The report also discusses various sources of financing, including: private financing; public revenue; and payroll taxes. In concluding, the authors note that policymakers often overlook the complementarity between basic education and later skill development. The consequence is that resources may be spent on expensive, low volume training programs when they might be used more cost-effectively and more equitably to upgrade the quality of basic education.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how contacts {{were used to}} secure apprenticeships in Early Modern Europe. How apprenticeship was facilitated matters for our understanding of citizenship because service through training {{was one of the}} main avenues on the road to citizenship for European youth prior to 1800. It is well-known that the conditions associated with apprenticeship varied considerably across Europe, most notably with longer terms in England than elsewhere. Much as in present-day employment relationships, parties entering into <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>agreements</b> had incomplete and imperfect information about one another. Were the variations in apprenticeship practice matched by different methods being used to secure training relationships? When did parties use contracts, and how did they structure them, to resolve issues of incomplete information? We use evidence from several apprenticeship contracts in five European countries and regions to consider these issues. We find that contract were most frequently used where the costs of contracting were low and the benefits higher. While the general structure of contracts was fairly similar where they were used, the typical package of compensation and training varied between regions, particularly in terms of wages and board offered to apprentices. To address issues of incomplete information, many contracts included penalty clauses to discourage ex-post renegotiation, and the information about contract signatories provided suggests that parties should have some knowledge of alternative options available to apprentices outside of the contract...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} works councils on apprenticeship training. The German law attributes works councils substantial information and co-determination rights on training-related issues. Thus, works councils may also {{have an impact on}} the cost-benefit relation of workplace training. Using detailed firm-level data containing information on the costs and benefits of apprenticeship training in Germany, we apply econometric matching methods to identify works council effects. We find that firms with works councils make a significantly higher net investment in apprenticeship training compared to firms without such an institution. However, we also find that the fraction of workers still employed with the same firm five years after training is significantly higher in the presence of works councils, enabling firms to recoup training investments over a longer time horizon. All works council effects, however, are much more pronounced for firms covered by collective bargaining agreements.
