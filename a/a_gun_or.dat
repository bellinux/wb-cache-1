5|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10 (Sonderkraftfahrzeug - special {{motorized}} vehicle) was a German half-track {{that saw}} widespread use in World War II. Its main role {{was as a}} prime mover for small towed guns such as the 2 cm FlaK 30, the 7.5 cm leIG, or the 3.7 cm PaK 36 anti-tank gun. It could carry eight troops in addition to towing <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>or</b> trailer.|$|E
5|$|In Serbia, men {{believed}} to possess properties of an ala were called aloviti (ala-like) men, {{and they were}} given several explanations. An ala may have sneaked into them; these were recognized by their voracity, because the ala, {{in order to satisfy}} her excessive hunger, drove them to eat incessantly. They may also have survived an ala blowing on them– an ala’s breath is usually lethal to humans. These people would then become exceptionally strong. Alternatively, they could be the offspring of an ala and a woman, or could have been born covered with the caul. It was believed that aloviti men could not be killed with <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>or</b> arrow, unless gold or silver was used.|$|E
5|$|Olds often {{lamented the}} lack of an {{internal}} gun in the F-4C he flew during his tour in Vietnam, but would not allow his fighters to be equipped with the gun pods then available. While he knew that he would be capable of effectively using them, he was also aware that none of his pilots were trained in the use of <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>or</b> dogfighting. He also reasoned that the drag of the pod would both degrade the performance characteristics of the F-4 while not gaining it any advantage against the more maneuverable MiG-17s and MiG-21s, result in unnecessary losses strafing worthless targets, and reduce the number of bombs carried by the Phantoms, the delivery of which was the 8th's primary mission.|$|E

5|$|Interior Minister Anne Holmlund, who {{had ordered}} the {{original}} investigation into the police officers' conduct in the Kauhajoki incident, said that legislation would be introduced to aid police officers in accessing information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses. This included, potentially, the ability to gain detailed information about an applicant's health, the right to subpoena records from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution, and the right to request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. In addition to this, Holmlund said that the referencing process for being granted a firearms license would be intensified: two referees would have to be personally interviewed before a license was granted. Holmlund also pointed to legislation of the EU as her starting point. Other reforms, that she said would be introduced as late as spring 2009, included a national register of gun owners. Parliamentary debates occurred on whether to raise the age at which one could own <b>a</b> <b>gun,</b> <b>or</b> whether to put further checks in place, in September 2009.|$|E
25|$|The motion {{controller}} features vibration-based haptic technology. In {{addition to}} providing a tracking reference, the controller's orb light {{can be used to}} provide visual feedback, simulating aesthetic effects such as the muzzle flash of <b>a</b> <b>gun,</b> <b>or</b> the paint on a brush.|$|E
25|$|The tools {{used for}} terrier work have {{essentially}} remained unchanged {{for more than}} 400 years – a small-chested and very game working terrier, a good roundpoint shovel, a digging bar, a brushhook to clear away hedge and bramble, fox nets, water for the dog and digger, and a snare to remove the quarry or <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>or</b> blunt instrument to dispatch it.|$|E

25|$|Animals {{are usually}} {{slaughtered}} by being first stunned and then exsanguinated (bled out). Death {{results from the}} {{one or the other}} procedure, depending on the methods employed. Stunning can be effected through asphyxiating the animals with carbon dioxide, shooting them with <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>or</b> a captive bolt pistol, or shocking them with electric current. In most forms of ritual slaughter, stunning is not allowed.|$|E
25|$|Equipment {{is carried}} by {{officers}} in a nylon equipment belt, {{also known as}} <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>or</b> weapon belt. The nylon belt, specifically designed to be very light-weight, was first issued in 2003 {{as a replacement for}} worn leather belts. The belt consists of one firearm holster placed on the hip (either side), one firearm magazine pouch, one ASP (baton) pouch, one OC Spray pouch, one hand cuff pouch and one holder for the portable radio.|$|E
25|$|The {{blood of}} the {{innocent}} victims of last Friday's outrage—and {{of the victims of}} similar outrages in the North and in England—is on the hands of every man who has fired <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>or</b> discharged a bomb in furtherance of the present campaign of violence in these islands—just as plainly as it is on the hands of those who parked the cars and set the charges last Friday. In our times, violence cannot be contained in neat compartments and justified in one case but not in another.|$|E

25|$|During {{his time}} in China, Gordon was well known and {{respected}} by friend and foe alike for leading from the front and going into combat armed only with his rattan cane (Gordon always refused to carry <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>or</b> a sword), a choice of a weapon that almost cost Gordon his life several times. Gordon's bravery in battle, his string of victories, apparent immunity to bullets and his intense, blazing blue eyes led many Chinese to believe that Gordon had supernatural powers and had harnessed the Qi (the mystical life-force traditionally believed in China to govern everything) in some extraordinary way.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} to suggest that the presence of violent objects such as a gun can trigger aggression. In a study done by Leonard Berkowitz and Anthony Le Page (1967), college students were made angry and then left in the presence of <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>or</b> badminton racket. They were then led to believe they were delivering electric shocks to another student, as in the Milgram experiment. Those {{who had been in the}} presence of the gun administered more shocks. It is possible that a violence-related stimulus increases the likelihood of aggressive cognitions by activating the semantic network.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Climaco staged his {{political}} comeback {{when he won}} re-election as Zamboanga City mayor {{under the banner of}} a political party he had organized, the Concerned Citizen's Aggrupation. By that time, crime and violence, often at the hands of policemen and the military, had become prevalent in the city, and a frustrated Climaco posted a scoreboard in front of city hall listing a running tally of unsolved violent crimes in the city. Climaco did not hesitate in denouncing the military and the police in the city, and had the police chief transferred out of the city. Upon the outbreak of violent incidents in the city, Climaco would rush to the scene on board his motorcycle and quell the disruption. Despite the threats of violence, Climaco never carried <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>or</b> surrounded himself with bodyguards.|$|E

500|$|According to Carter, it {{was evident}} that The X-Files was a [...] "series in making" [...] during this episode. The episode was {{inspired}} by common ufology. Believers in aliens have long thought that Nevada's Area 51 and Nellis Air Force Base have alien technology captured during 1947's Roswell UFO incident. The name Ellens Air Force Base was derived from the name of Carter's college girlfriend, whose last name was Ellens. The story's military project was inspired by a rumor that the United States Air Force had started a project named the Aurora Project. Carter said he remembered people talking about this rumor and that its inclusion in the story was a [...] "nod" [...] to it. The surname for the two guest characters, Budahas, came from a high school friend of Carter. Duchovny and Anderson had never used <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>or</b> held one before, so they were trained on how to hold them properly.|$|E
500|$|Among the {{traditional}} weapon dances of India is the Shad Sukmynsiem, {{performed in the}} north-eastern state of Meghalaya. Both Christians and Hindus may take part {{as long as they}} belong to Khasi community. Young lads clad in colourful silk dhotis dance around with a sword or spear {{in one hand and a}} plume in the other. The move in a protective circle around an inner circle of young maidens. A popular dance in Mizoram in the north-east corner of India is Sawlakin, a word that [...] "means spirit of the slain." [...] Traditionally, the dance [...] was led by the warrior who had hunted a big game or killed a man. He would wear his best clothes and a plume of red feather. He would wield <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>or</b> dao and a shield. He would be followed by other dancers in a row, who would also carry weapons, or cymbals or gongs.|$|E
500|$|The Xbox One's {{controller}} {{maintains the}} overall layout {{found in the}} Xbox 360's controller, but with various refinements to its form. Among its changes include a smoother form, textured analog sticks, a four-way directional pad, and redesigned triggers and shoulder buttons with a curved shape for ergonomics. [...] "Menu" [...] and [...] "View" [...] buttons have replaced the Start and Back buttons. Each trigger features independent rumble motors called [...] "Impulse Triggers", which allows developers to program directional vibration. One trigger {{can be made to}} vibrate when firing <b>a</b> <b>gun,</b> <b>or</b> both can work together to create feedback that indicates the direction of an incoming hit. The controller also contains light emitters that allow it to be tracked and paired using the Kinect sensor, and to detect when it's not being held to automatically enter a low-power state. An updated revision of the controller was released in June 2015, which includes a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack and other minor changes.|$|E
5000|$|Some of the {{weaknesses}} he noted in competing products were flimsy materials and poor handgun retention. For instance, several holster companies tell customers to use <b>a</b> heat <b>gun</b> <b>or</b> hair dryer on a holster if it doesn't hold <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> tight enough.|$|R

500|$|Gameplay in the {{top-down}} perspective {{consists of}} a series of labyrinths in which players defeat enemies along the way. The player switches between the 2D platforming mode and the top-down perspective by leaving the tank and entering small doorways located throughout the game. While in the top-down perspective, players can move Jason in any direction and destroy mutants with <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>or</b> with hand grenades. In this mode, players upgrade the gun by collecting gun capsules, but the gun degrades by one point if Jason receives damage from mutants or hazardous objects. Here players obtain additional vehicle functions by destroying bosses; these functions include weapon upgrades as well as abilities to swim freely underwater, drive on walls and ceilings, and hover above the ground. The game has a glitch – colloquially known as the [...] "grenade glitch" [...] – to easily defeat four of the game's underbosses. To exploit this glitch, the player throws a grenade at the boss, and while the grenade is exploding and causing damage on the boss, the player pauses the game. While the remainder of the action on the screen freezes, the grenade remains active, continuing to damage the boss. After fifteen seconds the player unpauses the game to find that the boss is destroyed.|$|E

One of the famous things about his learning is that he took lessons in flying an airplane.|$|E
2500|$|In 1943 the Fairmile D Type appeared. It was a motor {{torpedo boat}} – nicknamed the [...] "Dog Boat" [...] – and was {{designed}} as a counter to the German S-boat (known to the Allies as the [...] "E-boat"). It could be fitted as either <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>or</b> a torpedo boat, so the designation [...] "MGB" [...] disappeared and all the craft were labelled MTBs. It was a good sea boat and could maintain [...] at full load. The later D types carried four [...] torpedo tubes.|$|E
