5|$|The strikes {{reached the}} {{politically}} sensitive Baltic Sea coast, with <b>a</b> <b>sit-down</b> {{strike at the}} Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk beginning on 14 August. Among the leaders of this strike were Anna Walentynowicz and Lech Wałęsa, a long-fired shipyard electrician who headed the strike committee. A list of 21 demands was formulated by the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee on 17 August. The strike wave spread along the coast, closing the ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With {{the assistance of the}} activists from the KOR, and the support of many intellectuals (an Expert Commission was established to aid with the negotiations), the workers occupying the various factories, mines and shipyards across Poland organized as a united front. They were not limiting their efforts to seeking economic improvements, but made and stuck to the crucial demand, an establishment of trade unions independent of government control. Among other issues raised were rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners and an improved health service.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday 9 July 1995, the Orangemen {{marched to}} Drumcree Church, held their church service, {{and then began}} marching towards the Garvaghy Road.

25|$|The Ford Motor Company was {{the last}} Detroit automaker to {{recognize}} the United Auto Workers union (UAW). <b>A</b> <b>sit-down</b> strike by the UAW union in April 1941 closed the River Rouge Plant. Sorensen recounted that a distraught Henry Ford {{was very close to}} following through with a threat to break up the company rather than cooperate, but his wife Clara told him she would leave him if he destroyed the family business. In her view, it would not be worth the chaos it would create. Ford complied with his wife's ultimatum, and even agreed with her in retrospect. Overnight, the Ford Motor Company went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to the one with the most favorable UAW contract terms. The contract was signed in June 1941.|$|E
25|$|After the {{overthrow}} of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi by general Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état, the Egyptian government passed laws raising the minimum wage to 1,200 EGP per month. In February 2014, 13,000 Misr Helwan workers, some earning only 500 EGP per month, began <b>a</b> <b>sit-down</b> strike demanding the implementation of minimum wages. Workers also demanded unpaid bonuses. In April Egypt's Higher Administrative Court ruled that public sector employees who strike can be prosecuted, prompting clashes between Misr Helwan workers and Egyptian security forces. In June, the Sisi government called on workers to stop all strikes, and increase productivity. Some Misr Helwan workers stated that mismanagement had brought productivity to 50% of capacity through failure to provide adequate raw materials for production. Misr Helwan employees stated that their wages still remained below minimum wage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the march, {{thousands}} of British troops were flown to Northern Ireland. Less than twelve hours before the Sunday 6 July march, the authorities still did not say whether it would be blocked. Then, at 3:30am that morning, 1500 police and soldiers swept into the nationalist area in armoured vehicles and took control of the Garvaghy Road. About 100 residents managed to get to the road and stage <b>a</b> <b>sit-down</b> protest. They were forcefully removed by the police, who were then pelted with stones and petrol bombs as they pushed residents further back from the road. Rosemary Nelson—a prominent human rights lawyer and the GRRC's legal advisor—was physically and verbally abused by police officers. From this point onward, residents were prevented from leaving their housing estates and accessing the Garvaghy Road. As residents were also unable to reach the Catholic , the local priests held an open-air mass in front of a line of soldiers and armoured personnel carriers.|$|E

25|$|The protests were {{at their}} most violent in the capital Saigon, where pro-Buddhist {{students}} rioted, using bicycle chains and sticks as weapons, vandalised cars, threw rocks and shouted anti-American slogans. Street battles erupted between Kỳ's loyalist police and troops, as the dissidents fought tear gas with rocks, homemade spears, glass bottles and sometimes a hand grenade. The police frequently lost the ascendancy to the rioters, who dispersed them and forced them to flee. At one stage, the military mayor of Saigon went onto the streets in attempt {{to try to convince}} the rioters to stop, but he was pelted with projectiles as well. Often the protesters wore makeshift masks made of plastic bags and threw tear gas canisters back at the police and military, and regardless of who was on the receiving end, this often necessitated momentary retreats due to eye irritation. Some 300 Buddhists staged <b>a</b> <b>sit-down</b> protest at the national radio station in capital before the police used clubs to disperse them. The riots were repeated in the Central Highlands towns of Da Lat, Pleiku and Ban Me Thuot.|$|E
25|$|On June 23, 1967, Johnson {{traveled}} to Los Angeles for a Democratic fundraiser. Thousands of anti-war protesters tried to march past {{the hotel where}} he was speaking. The march was led {{by a coalition of}} peace protestors. However, a small group of Progressive Labor Party and SDS protestors activists placed themselves {{at the head of the}} march and, when they reached the hotel, staged <b>a</b> <b>sit-down.</b> Efforts by march monitors to keep the main body of the marchers moving were only partially successful. Hundreds of LAPD officers were massed at the hotel and when the march slowed an order was given to disperse the crowd. The Riot Act was read and 51 protestors arrested. This was one of the first massive war protests in the United States and the first in Los Angeles. Ending in a clash with riot police, it set a pattern for the massive protests which followed. Due to the size and violence of this event, Johnson attempted no further public speeches in venues outside military bases.|$|E
