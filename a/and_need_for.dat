5|$|Not all gallstones {{implicated in}} {{ascending}} cholangitis actually originate from the gallbladder, but cholecystectomy (surgical {{removal of the}} gallbladder) is generally recommended in {{people who have been}} treated for cholangitis due to gallstone disease. This is typically delayed until all symptoms have resolved and ERCP or MRCP have confirmed that the bile duct is clear of gallstones. Those who do not undergo cholecystectomy have an increased risk of recurrent biliary pain, jaundice, further episodes of cholangitis, <b>and</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> further ERCP or cholecystostomy; the risk of death is also significantly increased.|$|E
5|$|Mervyn Cowie {{oversaw the}} {{development}} of several of Kenya's national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind. This emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya's primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into {{the establishment of the}} parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife is not good for them. In 1948 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population <b>and</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> farmland. People live right next to the park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The human population also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{highlight}} the factors which influence experienced burden, coping <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> support of caregivers for patients with a bipolar disorder. Research articles meeting content and methodological quality criteria from January 1995 through October 2005 were reviewed. High objective and subjective burden is experienced by these caregivers. Subjective burden is extremely influenced by illness beliefs. High burden is associated more with severity of symptoms (than diagnosis), difficulties in the relationship with patient, {{lack of support and}} stigma. Coping is influenced by appraisal and burden. Different phases in the process of caregiving require different coping mechanisms. Little research is available on effectiveness of coping mechanisms <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> support. Suggestions are nevertheless found in the literature for professional support. Caregivers of patients with a bipolar disorder experience high burden and try to cope in different ways. Little research is available on coping styles <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> support. However, recommendations can be made to increase support for these caregivers...|$|R

To assess the presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, two different methods can be used: a skin prick test, or an allergy blood test.

25|$|Synchronized skating (formerly {{known as}} {{precision}} skating) is for mixed-gender groups of 12 to 20 skaters. This discipline resembles a group form of ice dance with additional emphasis on precise formations {{of the group}} as a whole and complex transitions between formations. The basic formations include wheels, blocks, lines, circles, and intersections. The close formations <b>and</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the team to stay in unison add to the difficulty of the footwork performed by the skaters in these elements.
