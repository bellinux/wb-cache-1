40|$|II. Indications for use The SenoScan ® Full-Field Digital Mammography System is a {{dedicated}} mammography system intended to produce radiographic {{images of the}} human breast {{for the purpose of}} diagnostic and screening mammography. The SenoScan ® Full-Field Digital Mammography system is intended {{to be used in the}} same clinical applications as traditional film-based mammographic systems. III. Device Description The SenoScan ® Full-Field Digital Mammography System (SenoScan®) includes a digital image receptor combined with a conventional mammographic X-ray device except for the collimator. The system consists of a dual filament x-ray tube, slit-collimator, x-ray generator, <b>support</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>support</b> <b>assembly,</b> compression device and CCD digital detector with readout equipment. The arm assembly consists of an X-ray tube on one end and a digital detector on the other end. The entire arm assembly pivots at the focal spot of the x-ray tube as the detector scans from left to right. The slit-collimator shapes the beam and limits the x-ray beam to the 1 -cm active width of the detector. This results in images with very little scatter and no dose penalty associated with absorption of primary radiation by a grid...|$|R

40|$|<b>Arm</b> <b>support</b> systems {{provide support}} {{throughout}} daily tasks, training {{or in an}} industrial environment. During the last decades a large diversity of actuated <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> systems have been developed. To analyze the actuation principles in these systems, an overview of actuated <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> systems is provided. This overview visualizes the current trends {{on research and development}} of these support systems and distinguishes three categories. These categories depend mainly on the functional status of the user environment, which defines the specifications. Therefore, the actuated <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> systems are classified according to their user environment, namely: ambulatory, rehabilitation and industrial. Furthermore, three main actuation principles and three mechanical construction principles have been identified...|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} {{supporting}} and selectively positioning an ion thruster {{relative to a}} surface of a spacecraft includes three angularly spaced thruster <b>support</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Each thruster <b>support</b> <b>assembly</b> includes a frame which has a rotary actuator mounted thereon. The rotary actuator is connected to an actuator member which is rotatably connected to a thruster attachment member connected to a body of the thruster. A stabilizer member is rotatably mounted to the frame and to the thruster attachment member. The thruster is selectively movable in the pitch and yaw directions responsive to movement of the actuator members by the actuators on the thruster <b>support</b> <b>assemblies.</b> A failure of any one actuator on a thruster <b>support</b> <b>assembly</b> will generally still enable limited thruster positioning capability in two directions. In a retracted position the thruster attachment members are held in nested relation in saddles supported on the frames of the thruster <b>support</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The thruster is securely held in the retracted position during periods of high loading such as during launch of the spacecraft...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Understanding how dynamic <b>arm</b> <b>supports</b> {{affect the}} ability to perform {{activities}} of daily living (ADL) in daily life situations is essential for improved prescription. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the newly developed MMAAS is a useful tool to assess the RoM at home. Secondly, to investigate differences in RoM and ADL performance with and without dynamic <b>arm</b> <b>support.</b> METHODS: Five dynamic <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> users performed nine activities with and without dynamic <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> at home. A reference group of five participants was included. Shoulder and elbow RoM were assessed for the three most difficult tasks. RESULTS: The measurement of the elbow joint RoM appeared unreliable. In most participants shoulder RoM increased with dynamic <b>arm</b> <b>support,</b> but the magnitude of change differed. Variation was also found regarding whether people could perform ADL with and without support. CONCLUSIONS: In its current state the MMAAS is not regarded a useful tool for assessing the RoM in the domestic setting. The ability to perform ADL and RoM seem influenced by the environment, users' needs and abilities. Future studies investigating effects and benefits of dynamic <b>arm</b> <b>supports</b> should be conducted in a broader daily life context...|$|R
40|$|Sit-to-stand {{exercise}} (STS) is {{a common}} activity of daily living. The objectives {{of the present study}} were: 1) to assess the validity of aerobic fitness measurements based on anaerobic thresholds (ATs), during incremental sit-to-stand exercise (ISTS) with and without <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> compared with an incremental cycle-ergometer (CE) test; and 2) to examine the reproducibility of the AT measured during the ISTSs. Twenty-six healthy individuals randomly performed the ISTS and CE test. Oxygen uptakes at the AT (AT-VO 2) and heart rate at the AT (AT-HR) were determined during the ISTSs and CE test, and repeated-measures analyses of variance and Tukey’s post-hoc test were used to evaluate the differences between these variables. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the strength of the relationship between AT-VO 2 and AT-HR during the ISTSs and CE test. Data analysis yielded the following correlations: AT-VO 2 during the ISTS with <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> and the CE test, r = 0. 77 (p < 0. 05); AT-VO 2 during the ISTS without <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> and the CE test, r = 0. 70 (p < 0. 05); AT-HR during the ISTS with <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> and the CE test, r = 0. 80 (p < 0. 05); and AT-HR during the ISTS without <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> and the CE test, r = 0. 66 (p < 0. 05). The AT-VO 2 values during the ISTS with <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> (18. 5 ± 1. 9 mL·min- 1 ·kg- 1) and the CE test (18. 4 ± 1. 8 mL·min- 1 ·kg- 1) were significantly higher than those during the ISTS without <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> (16. 6 ± 1. 8 mL·min- 1 ·kg- 1; p < 0. 05). The AT-HR values during the ISTS with <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> (126 ± 10 bpm) and the CE test (126 ± 13 bpm) were significantly higher than those during the ISTS without <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> (119 ± 9 bpm; p < 0. 05). The ISTS with <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> may provide a cardiopulmonary function load equivalent to the CE test; therefore, it is a potentially valid test for evaluating AT-VO 2 and AT-HR in healthy, young adults...|$|R

40|$|Adults with DMD {{can benefit}} from active <b>arm</b> <b>supports</b> that augment their {{residual}} functional capabilities. However, intuitively controlled and fully actuated <b>arm</b> <b>supports</b> are currently not commercially available and adults with DMD are limited to use external robotic arms which contribute to the disuse of their arms. To fill this gap {{in the field of}} <b>arm</b> <b>supports,</b> we have developed EMGand force-based control interfaces that have been implemented in two new active arm supports: the A-Arm and the Active A-Gear. We found that both EMGand force-based control interfaces are feasible solutions for the control of active <b>arm</b> <b>support</b> for adults with DMD that have lost their arm function a long time ago. The comparative studies between EMG and force-based control interfaces indicated that, in general, EMG-based control interfaces are better suited for adults with DMD than force-based control interfaces as they are experienced as less fatiguing. Nevertheless, force-based control interfaces with active gravity and joint-stiffness compensation can be a better alternative for those cases in which voluntary forces would still be higher than the intrinsic forces of the arms. This conclusion has an indicative value, as it is based on a low number of subjects. In any case, the decision on the most suited interface will have to be taken based on the specificities of each subject. In conclusion, by developing these new control interfaces and implementing them in new active assistive devices, we made a significant step in improving <b>arm</b> <b>supports</b> for adults with DMD. Hopefully, these novel concepts of <b>arm</b> <b>supports</b> will be the basis for the development of commercially available active <b>arm</b> <b>supports</b> for people with severe muscular weakness. The control and assistive strategies developed in the Flextension A-Gear project may be applicable to other patient groups with muscular weakness...|$|R

40|$|Complaints of {{musculoskeletal}} {{pain and}} discomfort from workers {{of a local}} manufacturing company, lead to study the effect on muscular activity at the shoulder and neck when performing an assembly task in Juarez, Mexico. A mock-up of the work station and task were developed; muscle load activity was measured using surface electromyography (SMEG) at the shoulder (deltoideus) and neck (trapezius) muscles while performing the <b>assembly</b> task without <b>arm</b> <b>support,</b> and using {{two different types of}} <b>arm</b> <b>supports.</b> SEMG signals were analyzed to estimate Root Mean Squares (RMS) and Median Frequency (MF). Subjective measures of Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE), discomfort, and preference rating measures were also assessed. Results showed lower muscular activity when using <b>arm</b> <b>supports.</b> No statistically significant effects were detected in RPE, discomfort, and preference of use. Introducing the use of <b>arm</b> <b>supports</b> in light industrial assembly jobs in Mexico may aid in decreasing the incidence of work related MSDs of the upper extremity...|$|R
