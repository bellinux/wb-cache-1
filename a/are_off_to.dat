5|$|This {{station was}} rebuilt as Ashford International {{during the early}} 1990s for {{international}} services from mainland Europe; this included the addition of two platforms {{to the north of}} station (the original down island platform had been taken over by international services). Unlike normal LGV stations in France, the through tracks for Ashford International railway station <b>are</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> one side rather than going through. The number of services was reduced after the opening of the Ebbsfleet station. A high-speed domestic service operated by Southeastern to London St Pancras began on 29 June 2009.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most LGV {{stations}} in France, the through tracks for Ashford International station <b>are</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> one side {{rather than going}} through, partly because the station pre-dates the line. High Speed 1 approaches Ashford International from the north in a cut-and-cover [...] "box"; the southbound line rises out of this cutting and crosses over the main tracks to enter the station. The main tracks then rise out of the cutting and over a flyover. On leaving Ashford, southbound Eurostars return to the high-speed line by travelling under this flyover and joining from the outside. [...] The international platforms at Ashford are supplied with both overhead 25kV AC and third-rail 750 V DC power, avoiding the need to switch power supplies.|$|E
500|$|The thirteenth {{season premiere}} {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker gave the episode a positive review, showing approval of Kenny's misadventure, saying [...] "thus did South Park ultimately {{come down on}} the side of religion and sexual freedom, with lots of big laughs in the bargain.... Trey and Matt <b>are</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a great 13th-season start." [...] James Poniewozik of Time said [...] "The Ring" [...] was better than any of the twelfth season episodes. Poniewozik said the episode, [...] "demonstrated that the cartoon is best when it focuses on the four kids and when it is driven by a white-hot moral fury". Travis Fickett of IGN also particularly applauded the Disney satire, which he said, [...] "elevates this beyond shock humor and into sharp satire." [...] IGN gave the episode an 8.4 score out of 10.|$|E

500|$|James Hunt of What Culture {{wrote in}} his review of the episode; [...] "It was a good return to the Seven Kingdoms (and beyond), one that was filled with tension throughout, and set about re-establishing the pieces on the board." [...] Ellen Gray [...] of Philadelphia Daily News noted in her review of the episode; [...] "First episodes are always difficult. So many people to check in on. Or kill. Or swear vengeance upon. Still, things <b>are</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> several {{promising}} starts." [...] Mark W. Pleiss of PopMatters {{wrote in his}} review of the episode; [...] "The most recent episode of HBO's Game of Thrones largely evaded the two major questions from the previous chapter, and instead lined up its sixth season to gravitate around the heroics and cunning of its female protagonists." [...] Tim Surette of TV.com wrote that Melisandre {{is one of his}} favorites characters.|$|E

2500|$|Hex said, [...] "It takes {{a week of}} {{long hours}} and hard work to put {{together}} a review on the show. Gaming, capturing all the game footage, logging all the footage, writing the review, re-writing, editing, filming, re-editing... the finished product is something I'm really proud of." [...] Bajo described the editing process as [...] "a bit like Machinima". Both he and Hex checked edits remotely during the period of the week when they had finished their filming {{and the rest of the}} crew [...] "shoot field stories and finish off the rest of the show". Hex said that during the playing of games and filming she became quite attached to her avatars and wanted to show off what her own character did. Hex says, [...] "We've tried our best on the show to present both sides of the argument in any stories we've done". Bajo explained: [...] "Mondays we finish of reviews, log footage, swap games, read scripts and sub everything after a production meeting, Tuesdays we make GG and GG: Pocket, Wednesdays are GGSP and any green screen stuff, then Hex and I <b>are</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> review for the rest of the week, while the gang shoot field stories and finish off the rest of the show. We check edits remotely usually which is my favourite part of the job. changes week to week but that's the general schedule" [...] Bajo has stated that [...] "often segment ideas are pretty spontaneous". When asked about taking on Good Game: Spawn Point as well as the original show, Bajo responded: [...] "we're busier than ever, but we've got things down to a pretty tight production schedule now".|$|E
