This paper recognises the benefits of adopting <b>alternative</b> ways of <b>working,</b> but also warns about the fragility of working environments. A well planned adoption process is required in order to ensure implementation success. Based on strategic asset management together with Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory, a method is proposed to accelerate the adoption process of <b>alternative</b> ways of <b>working</b> whilst keeping the balance between people, space and technology...|$|R

This is {{different}} from most science fiction settings, which use some form of nuclear power or a more obscure or invented power source. Confusingly, this V-engine {{is not the same}} design as a modern V-engine, but an <b>alternative</b> <b>working</b> design invented by students at the University of Colorado. The engine works by having two rotating cylindrical engine blocks with multiple chambers in each block. The blocks somewhat resemble large scale cylinders from a revolver handgun. The two rotating cylinders are set approximately 90 degrees from each other, and shared between each rotating block are several solid V-shaped rods that serve as pistons. As the blocks rotate inside their static housings openings in the sides of the rotating and static portions of the engine will line up and act as intake and exhaust ports, and also electrical contact connections trigger the spark plugs. The rotation of the cylinder blocks can then be tapped for electrical power generation or directly for hydraulic pressure.|$|E

In 1997, about two-thirds of these 1992 - 1993 graduates not enrolled in further education worked in jobs considered traditional for college graduates.

In some service organizations, policies governing employee scheduling practices may permit millions of different tours. A common heuristic {{strategy is to}} reformulate the problem from a small working subset of the feasible tours. Solution quality depends on the number and types of schedules included in the model. This paper describes a working subset heuristic based on column generation. The method is general and can accommodate a mix of full- and part-time employees. Experiments revealed its formulations had objective values indistinguishable from those of models using all feasible tours, and significantly lower than those generated by <b>alternative</b> <b>working</b> subset procedures. column generation, staffing and scheduling, service operations...|$|E

40|$|Adsorption-driven heat {{transformation}} {{has been}} reported {{as one of the}} most promising areas to bring metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) into industrial application.

Since the use of water comes with many drawbacks, short-chained alcohols have been proposed as an <b>alternative</b> <b>working</b> fluid. In this contribution, the working flow from adsorbent (HKUST- 1) characterization up to technical application is presented. Beginning with the thorough characterization of the process of direct crystallization on different structures, the results of methanol adsorption measurements are presented. Coatings are evaluated by applying the Dubinin–Astakhov approach to describe adsorption data and to calculate a coefficient of performance (COP). The maximum methanol uptake of the coatings was approximately 0. 6 gMeOH/gMOF, leading to a COP of 1. 5 at given temperatures. With respect to the cyclic application, the stability of HKUST- 1 and methanol has also been investigated...|$|E

40|$|This paper quantitatively {{evaluates the}} effects of several {{unconventional}} monetary policies for small open economies. In particular, a New Keynesian model is extended to include a liquidity premium, deviations from uncovered interest rate parity, and a premium in the term structure of interest rates, allowing the central bank to choose, {{in addition to its}} policy rate, the size and composition of its balance sheet. The model is calibrated to the case of Chile. We find that policies affecting the liquidity channel can potentially have large effects, but these depend on expectations about the future policy rate. On the other hand, <b>alternatives</b> <b>working</b> through the term premium have smaller effects, but they are less dependent on the expected path of the reference rate. We also study the possibility of undoing the unconventional policy as a possible exit strategy, with results indicating that this alternative may induce a significant slowdown, particularly if it is anticipated. Finally, we also consider the alternative of driving down the policy rate to its lower bound and maintaining it there for a prolonged period. While this policy can also be greatly expansionary, particularly after contractionary shocks, credibility issues regarding the promise of keeping the rate low for some time can severely undermine these effects. ...|$|R
