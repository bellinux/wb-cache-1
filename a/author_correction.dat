40|$|Thinking and {{research}} in respect of accounting and finance {{over the past three}} decades have been dominated by a methodology that is primarily based on the predictability of accounting data and its relationship to certain phenomena. The magnitude of change in business makes the future unpredictable. Analysts and managers are confronting an entirely new business environment in which traditional approaches are no longer valid. A systems approach provides a new way of looking at financial analysis. The purpose of this study is to focus on the present, on the ability to cope and the capacity to change in a changing environment. The ability to create an own future is being seen as more important than the art of predicting the future. This paper describes an empirically tested dynamic balance model to establish whether entities are able to adapt, survive and prosper. nf 2009 (<b>Author</b> <b>correction...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{southern}} Africa, various {{options to}} manage elephant populations are being considered. Immunocontraception {{is considered to}} be the most ethically acceptable and logistically feasible method for control of smaller and confined populations. In this regard, the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) vaccine has not been investigated in female elephants, although it has been reported to be safe and effective in several domestic and wildlife species. The aims of this study were to monitor the oestrous cycles of free-ranging African elephant cows using faecal progestagen metabolites and to evaluate the efficacy of a GnRH vaccine to induce anoestrus in treated cows. METHODS: Between May 2009 - June 2010, luteal activity of 12 elephant cows was monitored non-invasively using an enzyme immunoassay detecting faecal 5 alpha-reduced pregnanes (faecal progestagen metabolites, FPM) on a private game reserve in South Africa. No bulls of breeding age were present on the reserve prior to and {{for the duration of the}} study. After a 3 -month control period, 8 randomly-selected females were treated twice with 600 micrograms of GnRH vaccine (ImprovacW, Pfizer Animal Health, Sandton, South Africa) 5 - 7 weeks apart. Four of these females had been treated previously with the porcine zona pellucida (pZP) vaccine for four years (2004 - 2007). RESULTS: All 12 monitored females (8 treated and 4 controls) showed signs of luteal activity as evidenced by FPM concentrations exceeding individual baseline values more than once. A total of 16 oestrous cycles could be identified in 8 cows with four of these within the 13 to 17 weeks range previously reported for captive African elephants. According to the FPM concentrations the GnRH vaccine was unable to induce anoestrus in the treated cows. Overall FPM levels in samples collected during the wet season (mean 4. 03 micrograms/gram dry faeces) were significantly higher (P< 0. 002) than the dry season (mean 2. 59 micrograms/gram dry faeces). CONCLUSIONS: The GnRH vaccination protocol failed to induce anoestrus in the treated female elephants. These results indicate that irregular oestrous cycles occur amongst free-ranging elephants and are not restricted to elephants in captivity. The relationship between ecological conditions and endocrine activity were confirmed. Free-ranging female elephants were observed to not cycle continuously throughout the year in the absence of adult bulls.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{exponentially}} weighted {{moving average}} (EWMA) control chart that {{is capable of}} detecting changes in both process mean and standard deviation for autocorrelated data (referred to as the Maximum Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Chart for Autocorrelated Process, or MEWMAP chart). This chart is based on fitting a time series model to the data, and then calculating the residuals. The observations are represented as a first-order autoregressive process plus a random error term. The Average Run Lengths (ARLs) for fixed decision intervals and reference values (h, k) are calculated. The proposed chart is compared with the Max-CUSUM chart for autocorrelated data proposed by Thaga (2003). Comparisons are based on the out-of-control ARLs. The MEWMAP chart detects moderate to large shifts in the mean and/or standard deviation at both low and high levels of autocorrelations more quickly than the Max-CUSUM chart for autocorrelated processes.

40|$|Low {{molecular}} weight (LMW) proteins of E. ruminantium can induce proliferation of immune {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) {{and the production}} of interferongamma (IFN-y) by CD 4 +-enriched T-cells. In this study, a reverse vaccinology approach was applied to identify additional vaccine candidates focusing on genes that encode LMW proteins smaller than 20 kDa. Five open reading frames (ORFs) were selected from the E. ruminantium genome and their corresponding recombinant (r) proteins were produced in a bacterial expression system. Their ability to induce proliferative responses and IFN-y production was evaluated in vitro using lymphocyte proliferation and ELISPOT assays. All five recombinant proteins induced proliferation of immune PBMCs and IFN-y production by these cells. The corresponding five genes were each individually incorporated into pCMViUBs, a mammalian expression vector and tested as a potential vaccine in sheep using a DNA prime - protein boost immunisation regimen. A cocktail of these DNA constructs protected one out of five sheep against a virulent E. ruminantium (Welgevonden) needle challenge. Three of the five vaccinated sheep showed an increase in their proliferative responses and production of IFN-y before challenge. This response decreased after challenge in the sheep that succumbed to the challenge and increased in the sheep that survived. This finding indicates that sustained IFN -y production is likely to be involved in conferring protective immunity against heartwater.

40|$|An {{immunoperoxidase}} assay for {{the detection}} of African horse sickness virus (AHSV) in formalin-fixed tissues is a valuable tool {{in the study of the}} pathogenesis of the disease, as well as a useful addition to existing diagnostic tests when only preserved tissues are available. An assay that uses Hamblin antiserum in a basic avidin–biotin complex detection system was standardized and validated in accordance with the guidelines of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians Subcommittee on Standardization of Immunohistochemistry. Using 128 positive cases of African horse sickness confirmed by viral isolation and serotyping and 119 negative cases from countries where the disease has never occurred, diagnostic sensitivity and diagnostic specificity were 100 % in the prime target tissues of heart and lung. There was no variation in the ability of the assay to detect all 9 serotypes of AHSV, and there was no cross-reactivity with other orbiviruses in formalin-fixed tissues. The only cross-reactivity observed was in the lungs of 2 negative cases infected with Rhodococcus equi. The assay gave good results on tissues that had been fixed in formalin for up to 365 days. Nonspecific staining was minimal provided that the standard procedures for processing and staining tissues were followed. Good immunohistochemical results were also obtained on samples fixed as long as 24 hr after death. The assay, therefore, provides a robust diagnostic tool for detection of AHSV in formalin-fixed tissues, provided the analysis is done by an experienced pathologist. ab 2013 (<b>Author</b> <b>correction...</b>|$|E
40|$|When {{an exotic}} {{infectious}} disease invades a susceptible environment, protection zones are enforced. Historically, such zones have been shaped as circles of equal radius (ER), centred {{on the location}} of infected premises. Because the ER policy seems to assume that epidemic dissemination is driven by a similar number of secondary cases generated per primary case, it does not consider whether local features, such as connectivity, influence epidemic dispersal. Here we explored the efficacy of ER protection zones. By generating a geographically explicit scenario that mimicked an actual epidemic, we created protection zones of different geometry, comparing the cost-benefit estimates of ER protection zones {{to a set of}} alternatives, which considered a pre-existing connecting network (CN) – the road network. The hypothesis of similar number of cases per ER circle was not substantiated: the number of units at risk per circle differed up to four times among ER circles. Findings also showed that even a small area (of < 115 km 2) revealed network properties. Because the CN policy required 20 % less area to be protected than the ER policy, and the CN-based protection zone included a 23. 8 % greater density of units at risk/km 2 than the ER-based alternative, findings supported the view that protection zones are likely to be less costly and more effective if they consider connecting structures, such as road, railroad and/or river networks. The analysis of local geographical factors (contacts, vectors and connectivity) may optimize the efficacy of control measures against epidemics. [URL] (<b>Author</b> <b>correction...</b>|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Hospital {{acquired}} infections (HAI) {{are serious}} {{problems in the}} patient care and management despite antimicrobial therapy and advances in supportive care in developing countries. Regular cleaning following institutionalized guidelines of infection control policies can minimize the possibility of contamination and prevent the HAI so that the morbidity and mortality related to HAI will be reduced. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Descriptive analysis of the culture growth of the samples from different sites of the Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital (KMCTH) environment from 4 th March, 2011 to 4 th April, 2012 was done. The swabs were taken before and after fumigation and disinfection and number of colonies grown were used to monitor {{the effectiveness of the}} intervention. The cultures and Gram staining were performed as per standard microbiological procedures in Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital. RESULTS: Almost all the floors of the hospital wards swabbed were contaminated with the bacteria. The bacteria that grew from the environment ranged from 50 to 140 colonies in Medical Intensive Care Unit and Special High Care Unit respectively. Common contaminants were Staphylococci spp., Gram negative diplococcic, and Gram positive. The Staphylococci spp. contaminated air in most of the wards. The number of colonies after fumigation and disinfection were drastically decreased from no growth to 15 colonies. CONCLUSIONS: Environment was contaminated with microorganisms. Even after regular cleaning and disinfection, bacterial growth was seen. To prevent any contamination prior HAI develops, hospital needs to develop programmes for the implementation of good infection control practices. Article submitted 08 November 2012.

40|$|Although dog prostatic fluid {{decreases}} {{the longevity of}} ejaculated dog spermatozoa, it also increases their rate of motility and their fertility after vaginal insemination, {{as well as the}} fertility of epididymal spermatozoa after uterine insemination. These findings indicate a need to further characterize the effects of prostatic fluid on dog spermatozoa. This study was done to determine the effects (P < 0. 05) of homologous prostatic fluid added prior to cooling, after thawing, or at both times to epididymal spermatozoa from 21 dogs. The effects of two extenders were also determined. The one extender was Biladyl* with Equex STM paste** (BilEq) and the other Andromed* (Minitüb, Tiefenbach, Germany (*); Nova Chemical Sales, Scituate, MA, USA (**)). The response variables were percentage progressively motile spermatozoa (Prog) and morphology after thawing. Prog was measured at various times until 8 h after extension (unfrozen spermatozoa) or until 2 h after thawing. Prog after thawing was higher with BilEq than Andromed, when no prostatic fluid was added prior to cooling, and when prostatic fluid was added after thawing. BilEq resulted in a higher mean percentage of spermatozoa with bent principle pieces than Andromed and the addition of prostatic fluid prior to cooling resulted in lower mean percentages of cytoplasmic droplets and bent principle pieces than when none was added. The optimal combination was BilEq with prostatic fluid added prior to cooling (in order to inhibit the development of bent principle pieces) and after thawing (to achieve higher motility until 1 h after thawing). This study shows that BilEq is more suitable for the freezing of epididymal spermatozoa than Andromed and that prostatic fluid improves the freezability and post-thaw longevity of epididymal spermatozoa frozen in BilEq. ab 2013 (<b>Author</b> <b>correction...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The avian glottis {{channels}} {{air from}} the oropharynx to the trachea and is situated on an elevated structure, the laryngeal mound. It is imperative that the glottis be protected and closed during swallowing, which in mammals is achieved by covering the glottis with the epiglottis, {{as well as by}} adduction of the arytenoid cartilages. An epiglottis, however, is reportedly absent in birds. Ratites such as Struthio camelus and Dromaius novaehollandiae possess a very wide glottis in comparison to other birds. The question therefore arises as to how these large birds avoid inhalation of ingesta through a wide glottis, with apparently little protection, particularly as their feeding method involves throwing the food over the glottis to land in the proximal esophagus. RESULTS: In S. camelus when the glottis was closed and the tongue body retracted, the smooth tongue root became highly folded and the rostral portion of the laryngeal mound was encased by the pocket in the base of the − shaped tongue body. In this position the lingual papillae also hooked over the most rostral laryngeal projections. However, in D. novaehollandiae, retraction of the tongue body over the closed glottis resulted in the prominent, triangular tongue root sliding over the rostral portion of the laryngeal mound. In both S. camelus and D. novaehollandiae these actions resulted in the rostral portion of the laryngeal mound and weakest point of the adducted glottis being enclosed and stabilised. CONCLUSIONS: Only after conducting a comparative study between these two birds using fresh specimens did it become clear how specific morphological peculiarities were perfectly specialised to assist in the closure and protection of the wide glottis. We identify, describe and propose a unique anatomical mechanism in ratites, which may functionally replace an epiglottis; the linguo-laryngeal apparatus.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{effectively}} {{control the}} geographical dissemination of infectious diseases, their properties {{need to be}} determined. To test that rapid microbial dispersal requires not only susceptible hosts but also a pre-existing, connecting network, we explored constructs meant to reveal the network properties associated with disease spread, which included the road structure. METHODS: Using geo-temporal data collected from epizoonotics in which all hosts were susceptible (mammals infected by Foot-and-mouth disease virus, Uruguay, 2001; birds infected by Avian Influenza virus H 5 N 1, Nigeria, 2006), two models were compared: 1) ‘connectivity’, a model that integrated bio-physical concepts (the agent’s transmission cycle, road topology) into indicators designed to measure networks (‘nodes’ or infected sites with short- and long-range links), and 2) ‘contacts’, which focused on infected individuals but did not assess connectivity. RESULTS: The connectivity model showed five network properties: 1) spatial aggregation of cases (disease clusters), 2) links among similar ‘nodes’ (assortativity), 3) simultaneous activation of similar nodes (synchronicity), 4) disease flows moving from highly to poorly connected nodes (directionality), and 5) a few nodes accounting for most cases (a ‘‘ 20 : 800 pattern). In both epizoonotics, 1) not all primary cases were connected {{but at least one}} primary case was connected, 2) highly connected, small areas (nodes) accounted for most cases, 3) several classes of nodes were distinguished, and 4) the contact model, which assumed all primary cases were identical, captured half the number of cases identified by the connectivity model. When assessed together, the synchronicity and directionality properties explained when and where an infectious disease spreads. CONCLUSIONS: Geo-temporal constructs of Network Theory’s nodes and links were retrospectively validated in rapidly disseminating infectious diseases. They distinguished classes of cases, nodes, and networks, generating information usable to revise theory and optimize control measures.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objectives}} of the studies listed here were to ascertain the therapeutic and sustained efficacy of 10 % imidacloprid (w/w) and 4. 5 % flumethrin (w/w) incorporated in a slow-release matrix collar, against laboratory-infestations of fleas and ticks on cats. Efficacy was evaluated against the flea Ctenocephalides felis felis, and the ticks Ixodes ricinus, Amblyomma americanum and Rhipicephalus turanicus. The number of studies was so large that only a general overview can be presented in this abstract. METHODS: Preventive efficacy was evaluated by infesting groups of cats (n = 8 - 10) with C. felis felis and/or I. ricinus, A. americanum or R. turanicus at monthly intervals at least, {{for a period of}} up to 8 months. Efficacy against fleas was evaluated 24 to 48 h after treatment and 24 h after infestation, and against ticks at 6 h (repellent) or 48 h (acaricidal) after infestation. Efficacy against flea larvae was evaluated over a period of 8 months by incubating viable flea eggs on blanket samples after cat contact. In all cases efficacy was calculated by comparison with untreated negative control groups. RESULTS: Efficacy against fleas (24 h) generally exceeded 95 % until study termination. In vitro efficacy against flea larvae exceeded 92 % until Day 90 and then declined to 67 % {{at the conclusion of the}} study on Day 230. Sustained acaricidal (48 h) efficacy over a period of eight months was consistently 100 % against I. ricinus from Day 2 after treatment, 100 % against A. americanum, except for 98. 5 % and 97. 7 % at two time-points, and between 94 % and 100 % against R. turanicus. From Day 2 until 8 months after treatment the repellent (6 h), efficacy was consistently 100 % against I. ricinus, and between 54. 8 % and 85. 4 % against R. turanicus. CONCLUSION: The rapid insecticidal and acaricidal properties of the medicated collars against newly- acquired infestations of fleas and ticks and their sustained high levels of preventive efficacy have been clearly demonstrated. Taking into account the seasonality of fleas and ticks, the collars have the potential to prevent the transmission of vector-borne diseases and other conditions directly associated with infestation throughout the season of parasite abundance.

40|$|Revision {{requested}} by <b>author.</b> <b>Correction</b> to page 9. To the outside observer today, Nigeria {{is a state}} whose political troubles are sunk in its oil wells. Yet in truth the difficulties facing Nigeria are reflective of colonialism’s alteration of Nigerian society, {{and in order to}} truly understand Nigeria’s complex landscapes, one has to understand the evolution of complex national identities. As modern states emerge, each of them are influenced, driven, or in some extreme cases formed entirely around ethnic, religious, and cultural histories. However within some states with sizable minority populations, a counter-cultural form of nationalism is created, whereby a specific group’s culture, beliefs, or history becomes a call for that group’s own state. Whether in the Basque region of Spain, in Iraqi and Turkish Kurdistan, in Quebec, or in Scotland, self-identity around a specific culture can directly lead to nationalist movements. These movements can either resu lt in violent struggles (Georgia’s Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions), prolonged postponement (Morocco’s Western Sahara region), or in independence referendums (Scotland in 2014). Yet regardless of the various effectiveness of identity-driven nationalist movements, states with large populations that share a common social cleavage eventually must deal with their identity crisis in some capacity. Nigerians, however, face an ongoing identity crisis whereby {{it can be difficult to}} conceptualize a singular Nigerian identity. Yet herein lies the value of understanding colonial influence on Nigerian identity: Islam and Modern Nationalism are so generationally ingrained that these two competing ideologies supersede all other social cleavages on a national scale. Nigeria’s north/south divide is a rift created as two supremely opposite regions were morphed into two distinct colonies and then abruptly joined together. As northerners of different ethnicities were coalesced into Northern Nigeria, Islam became the uniting identity category that grew in importance as the effects of colonial neglect grew more pronounced. On balance, the institutionalization of hundreds of groups of southerners as a result of a loss of traditional kingship placed southerners in colonial positions and institutions that would eventually lead to pan-Nigerianism. Rather than the single group counter-culture n ationalism prevalent in many states, Nigerians instead face a unique challenge as the ethnic, religious, and culture cleavages of several hundred groups have been consolidated and generalized into a north/south regional divide. As a result of direct rule through the deconstruction of kingship in the south and as a result of indirect rule and isolation of kingship in the north, Nigerians’ identities have been ideologically blended, but geographically placed into contention...|$|E
40|$|In 2008, a {{suspected}} outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was {{reported on a}} farm in the Bela-Bela area, Limpopo Province, South Africa. Seven calves died on the affected dairy farm, where no RVF vaccination programme was practised. No apparent clinical disease was reported in the other 300 cattle (33 calves included) or 200 sheep on the farm. During the outbreak, blood samples from 77. 7 % (233 / 300) of the cattle and 36. 5 % (73 / 200) of the sheep were collected on the affected farm and 55 blood samples were taken from cattle on a neighbouring farm. Eight weeks later, 78 % of the cattle (234 / 300) and 42. 5 % of the sheep (85 / 200) were bled on the affected farm only. All sera were tested by an Immunoglobulin M (IgM) -capture Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by an indirect Immunoglobulin G (IgG) ELISA. Selected IgM-positive (n = 14), IgG-positive (n = 23) and samples negative for both IgM and IgG-specific antibodies against RVF virus (n = 19) were tested using the serum neutralisation test (SNT). Sera from IgM-positive (n = 14) and negative (n = 20) animals were also tested by a TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR). On the affected farm, 7 % (16 / 233) of the cattle were IgM-positive and 13. 7 % (32 / 233) IgG-positive at the first bleed and 2 % were IgM-positive at the second bleed, whilst the number of cattle positive for IgG-specific antibodies increased by 21. 3 % compared with the first bleed. Only 1. 4 % of sheep were positive for both IgM and IgG antibodies at the first collection; at the second bleed, IgM-positive cases decreased to 1. 2 %, whilst IgG-positive cases increased to 2. 4 %. Whilst no IgM-positive cattle were found on the neighbouring farm, 5. 5 % of cattle were IgG-positive. The SNT confirmed most of the ELISA results, whilst PCR results were all negative. Although serology results indicated virus circulation on both farms, the negative PCR results demonstrated that the animals were not viraemic at the time they were sampled. The movement of infected mosquito vectors by wind over long distances into a low-lying area that favoured their breeding on the Bela-Bela farm may have led to an outbreak of the disease there, but the reason for the low level of virus circulation amongst susceptible animals remains unclear. The research was done as part of a Master’s dissertation by L. P. M. (University of Pretoria). The practical work was done by him at the DVTD and NICD, under supervision of E. H. V. (University of Pretoria) and co-supervised by J. T. P. (National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory Service) and J. A. W. C. (University of Pretoria). E. H. V.

5000|$|The Appendix lists common {{mistakes}} in the written Latin of the time. In these mistakes, we can observe tendencies in the grammar, spelling, and pronunciation of the contemporary vernacular which would become the various Romance languages. The <b>author's</b> <b>corrections</b> of these usages give us insight into how Latin was evolving at that time. For example, the instruction [...] ("passim, not passi") or [...] ("numquam, not numqua") tells the reader that the Classical Latin word is written with an [...] at the end, which indicated nasalization. This common spelling error suggests that nasal vowels were being denasalized in Vulgar Latin. Many of these mistakes later became standard spelling, cf. Spanish nunca, from [...] (numqua). In some cases, the document recommends forms that are not the usual Classical ones, for example [...] ("amfora, not ampora") recommends an , whereas amphora is normally spelled with [...]|$|R

40|$|In this {{manuscript}} we develop necessary optimality conditions for weak and strong minimizer in control problems on finite and infinite horizon. We show, that the control {{problems on the}} infinite horizon are proper generalizations of the finite horizon problems. Therefore, we have to develop an innovative theoretical approach. The first chapters are devoted to known results and methods for weak and strong minimizer in finite horizon optimal control problems. In the last parts we extend these methods to infinite horizon problems. The chief task is the comprehension of the infinite horizon as a singularity in any element of the control problem. This singularity {{is not included in}} the classical control problems with finite horizon. Hence we have to verify, reconsider and enhance all known arguments and methods for finite horizon optimal control problems.
