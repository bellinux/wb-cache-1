50|$|A throat {{microphone}}, also laryngophone, {{is a type}} {{of contact}} microphone that absorbs vibrations directly from the wearer's throat by way of single or dual sensors worn against the neck. The sensors, called transducers, can pick up speech even in extremely noisy or windy environments such as on a motorcycle, or in a nightclub. Other types of microphones do not function well under these conditions because of high levels of background noise. Advanced laryngophones are able to pick up whispers, and therefore perform well in environments where communicating with others at a distance in silence is required, such as during covert military operations. Throat microphones are also very useful when helmets or respiratory protection is required. Many full-face SCBA, CABA, SAR respirator, PAPR or re-breather masks do not have a provision for a microphone inside the mask. The throat microphone can be used safely, as it is positioned outside the mask's face seal and as such does not compromise the respiratory protection provided by the mask, nor does it violate mask <b>approvals</b> <b>and</b> <b>certification.</b>|$|R

50|$|Naval architecture, {{also known}} as naval {{engineering}}, is an engineering discipline dealing with the engineering design process, shipbuilding, maintenance, and operation of marine vessels and structures. Naval architecture involves basic and applied research, design, development, design evaluation and calculations during all stages {{of the life of}} a marine vehicle. Preliminary design of the vessel, its detailed design, construction, trials, operation and maintenance, launching and dry-docking are the main activities involved. Ship design calculations are also required for ships being modified (by means of conversion, rebuilding, modernization, or repair). Naval architecture also involves formulation of safety regulations and damage control rules and the <b>approval</b> <b>and</b> <b>certification</b> of ship designs to meet statutory and non-statutory requirements.|$|E

30|$|For nurseries, {{there is}} an urgent need to motivate private and {{governmental}} sectors to satisfy the requirement of our national certified strawberry seedlings. A strawberry nursery certification program against PPNs, especially RKNs, should include strict sanitation practices especially both site <b>approval</b> <b>and</b> pre-movement <b>certification</b> of strawberry seedlings before they leave the nurseries. Similar citrus certification program {{has been successful in}} Florida, USA (Inserra et al. 2005). Therefore, all stakeholders in Egypt should tackle the problem collectively and, in particular, allocate sufficient funds for certified seedlings and provide relevant experts who can apply similar adopted procedures. Regrettably, most farmers are forced to obtain seedlings from informal sources such as local private markets since certified seedlings are costly and not easily available. Limitation in distribution of certified seedlings is further aggravated by both their small-scale production and the lack of awareness of these nematodes by many resource-poor farmers. As suggested with citriculture (Abd-Elgawad et al. 2016), regulation on certifiable pathogens of strawberry-propagating material may also include bacteria, fungi, and other transmissible pathogens in Egypt.|$|R

However, it does not prevent individuals from constructing and using traps that comply with designs approved by the competent authorities. (Competent authorities are legal bodies that regulate trapping, including governments, government mandated agencies and those Aboriginal groups with authority to regulate wildlife management activities.) Traps not meeting the Agreement Standards must be phased out by the signatories.

The CAVE is part of the Discovery Corner, a one-stop-shop for students to create and modify the 3D models and VR projects for their assignments and research. The CAVE itself is a projection-based Virtual Reality (VR) display inside a room-sized cube that multiple persons can use to share the same immersive experience. The Library's Discovery Corner is also equipped with a VR Head Mount Display (HMD) to let students experience immersion individually. Apart from CAVE, inside the Discovery Corner, 3D scanning services and desktop computers are available.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a leadership development model which departs radically {{from the traditional}} leader preparation programs. Leadership is perceived not as a complex of skills and characteristics accruing to an individual but as the initiation and maintenance of an ongoing process of self and organizational renewal. The process envisioned involves a consortium of various education agencies, including university and state department personnel, teachers, administrators, students, and community members. This broad involvement, plus the capability to institutionalize the process through program <b>approval,</b> <b>certification,</b> <b>and</b> accreditation procedures offers real promise for significant and lasting relevance and accountability. The renewal process would occur simultaneously in all the participating agencies, which would ensure continuing adaptability and flexibility to changing needs {{on the part of}} educators and those who prepare and certify them. The model offers an opportunity to institutionalize planned change across a broad spectrum from preparation to practice. (MBM) ikkACT KANSAS 76 &INCEPT PAPER. C...|$|R
