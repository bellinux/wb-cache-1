5|$|The {{western front}} facade {{is flanked by}} two square towers. They are both three stories high topped with silver domes and a Christian cross on top of these. Both towers have windows <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>level.</b> Access to the towers is through either of two small wooden doors located in the {{interior}} northwest and southwest corners of the church vestibule.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>each</b> <b>level</b> of {{the spinal}} column, spinal nerves branch off {{from either side}} of the spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by the spinal cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E

5|$|Pettibone methodically progressed {{through the}} Phillies' farm system, {{generally}} spending about one season <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>level</b> until 2012, when he {{advanced to the}} Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs after spending {{a majority of the}} season with the Double-A Reading Fightin Phils. Early in 2013, the Phillies promoted him to the major league club, and he made 18 starts with the Phillies before inflaming his rotator cuff, for which the Phillies precautionarily did not use him {{for the remainder of the}} season. He began the 2014 season competing for a spot in the back of the Phillies starting rotation, and he did make two starts, but was ineffective, and was sent back to the minor leagues, where he sustained a SLAP tear, and was placed on the disabled list.|$|E
5|$|Students explore broad {{learning}} themes <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>level</b> {{that allow}} them to learn across subjects and engage them in creative and collaborative projects. The second group, for example, spends much of their year on the study of trees, using trees as a focus for biology, mathematics, art, and creative writing. Students adopt and study a personal space in the nearby forest preserve. The year culminates with the tapping of maple trees to make syrup, which they share {{with the rest of the}} school. Each group engages different themes and group projects. Lower school students simulate an airplane flight to Paris and host a Japanese luncheon. The fourth group holds a Native American Fair, the fifth group creates an original Egyptian style mastaba, the sixth group presents a World's Fair, and the eighth group organizes an Immigration and Ethnic Fair.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{internal}} assessment (IA) varies by subject. There may be oral presentations (used in languages), practical work (in experimental sciences and performing arts), or written work. Internal assessment accounts for 20 to 50 percent of the mark awarded for each subject and {{is marked by a}} teacher in the school. A sample of at least five per subject <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>level</b> from a school will also be graded by a moderator appointed by the IB, in a process called external moderation of internal assessment. Based on this moderation, the grades of the whole subject from that school will change.|$|E

5|$|South east of {{the keep}} was the hall, built by Roger Clifford in the late 14th century as a {{replacement}} for an earlier hall. It provided space for the castle's garrison, swelled by the Anglo-Scottish Wars, and was a location for the lord to eat with his soldiers. The hall had large windows which may have detracted from the building's defensive capability, although it has been postulated that casements bore large wooden shutters. The kitchen, which served the entire castle, was set in the south-east corner of the fortification. Along the south wall were arranged more lodgings, a well, and a chapel, the latter another addition by Roger Clifford. In the south-west corner of the castle was the Tower of League, built around 1300 by Roger Clifford. It included further rooms for accommodation, but notably would also have allowed defenders to fire on an enemy emerging from the gatehouse. Four storeys tall and with a single room <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>level,</b> the presence of a garderobe and fireplace on each floor suggests that the tower was reserved for high-status visitors. The tower's square plan is typical of such structures built in northern England at this time, as seen at castles such as Warkworth and Egremont, although it contrasts with rounded towers preferred in the south.|$|E

25|$|A {{separator}} {{hierarchy of}} this type forms {{the basis for a}} tree decomposition of the given graph, in which the set of vertices associated with each tree node is the union of the separators on the path from that node to the root of the tree. Since the sizes of the graphs go down by a constant factor <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>level</b> of the tree, the upper bounds on the sizes of the separators also go down by a constant factor <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>level,</b> so the sizes of the separators on these paths add in a geometric series to O(√n). That is, a separator formed in this way has width O(√n), and can be used to show that every planar graph has treewidth O(√n).|$|E

25|$|Encapsulation is used {{to provide}} {{abstraction}} of protocols and services. Encapsulation is usually aligned with {{the division of the}} protocol suite into layers of general functionality.

25|$|In economics, {{marginal}} cost {{is the change}} in the opportunity cost that arises when the quantity produced is incremented by one unit, that is, it is the cost of producing one more unit of a good. Intuitively, {{marginal cost}} <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>level</b> of production includes the cost of any additional inputs required to produce the next unit. <b>At</b> <b>each</b> <b>level</b> of production and time period being considered, marginal costs include all costs that vary with the level of production, whereas other costs that do not vary with production are considered fixed. For example, the marginal cost of producing an automobile will generally include the costs of labor and parts needed for the additional automobile and not the fixed costs of the factory that have already been incurred. In practice, marginal analysis is segregated into short and long-run cases, so that, over the long run, all costs (including fixed costs) become marginal.|$|E

25|$|In hadith terminology, a hadith {{is divided}} into two {{categories}} based, essentially, upon the number of narrators mentioned <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>level</b> in a particular isnād. Consideration is given to the least number of narrators at any level of the chain of narration; thus if ten narrators convey a hadith from two others who have conveyed it from ten, it is considered `aziz, not mashhur.|$|E
25|$|Searching {{is similar}} to searching a binary search tree. Starting at the root, the tree is recursively traversed from top to bottom. <b>At</b> <b>each</b> <b>level,</b> the search reduces its field of view to the child pointer (subtree) whose range {{includes}} the search value. A subtree's range {{is defined by the}} values, or keys, contained in its parent node. These limiting values are also known as separation values.|$|E
