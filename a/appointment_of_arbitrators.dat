40|$|Critics of {{international}} arbitration predominantly invoke {{the concept of}} "fairness" in four ways.

Second, fairness is also used as a criterion for assessing dispute resolution outcomes, in regard to how arbitral tribunals choose their interpretive methodologies or retain subjective discretion when applying substantive law or rules to the given facts of a dispute. Third, critics assert unfairness in pointing out the absence of full judicial review of arbitral awards with merely a limited recourse to appeal as the control mechanism in international arbitration. Fourth, recent empirical attempts by scholars argue fairness synonymously with the legitimacy of community decision-making and participation rights, where questions have arisen in regard to perceived inequalities in the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators,</b> the composition of arbitral tribunals, and the ability of arbitrators to resolve public interest dimensions attaching to international arbitration disputes [...] . et...|$|E
40|$|History and Background: The {{history of}} {{statutory}} labour dispute resolution of South Africa {{dates back to}} 1909, when the Transvaal Disputes Prevention Act of 1909 was promulgated which applied only to the Transvaal. The Industrial Conciliation Act of 1924 established industrial councils and ad hoc conciliation boards and excluded black workers from the statutory definition of employee and {{this resulted in a}} dual industrial relations system that existed up to 1979. The history of statutory labour dispute resolution of Swaziland dates back to 1980 when the first Industrial Relations Act of 1980 was promulgated which established the first Industrial Court. Research Findings: The dispute resolution systems of South Africa and Swaziland contain both similarities and differences. Lessons for Swaziland include combining general and specific dispute resolution procedures, providing the right of a referring party to apply for condonation for late referral of a dispute, using conciliation-arbitration, making arbitration proceedings public hearings, influence of parties on the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators,</b> court adjudication, pre-dismissal arbitration, court adjudication by judges only, establishment of a constitutional court, full protection of protected strikes/ lockouts from interdicts, legalization of sympathy strikes, and removal of strikes/ lockout ballot.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the arbitration {{function of the}} Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service [ACAS] as one form of third party intervention in British industrial relations. It provides {{an explanation for the}} apparent contradiction between the stance taken by Conservative governments post- 1979 to trade union reform on the one hand; and the survival of an agency which maintains many of the attitudes and practices associated with the past on the other. In spite of government rhetoric and changes which have occurred in the period examined, it is argued that the key attitudes and practices in relation to arbitration have not altered significantly over time. Questionnaire surveys of arbitrators and the parties to arbitration were conducted in conjunction with a study of arbitration awards over the period 1942 - 1985. These revealed that many of the debates relating to arbitration, including support for voluntarism and resistance to compulsion in the process, the criteria for the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators</b> with appropriate skills and experience and the factors which arbitrators should consider in making their awards, have their foundation {{in the early part of}} this century: that the main focus of criticisms of arbitration surround issues of pay and terms and conditions of employment and that they were unfounded: and that the majority of parties to arbitration were satisfied with the service they received. The practice of arbitration was located within the corporatist theory debate and it was contended that elements of corporatist and pluralist relationships and networks within ACAS had survived the election of a government openly hostile to both corporatism and quangos. Explanations for the survival of ACAS and the arbitration service as one form of third party intervention can be found within the corporatist and dualist debate and understood within the context of the role which arbitration has played in the history of British industrial relations...|$|E
40|$|Arbitrations {{involving}} {{more than}} two parties and complex multicontractual issues represent more than one third of international arbitration cases, and this proportion increases every year. The difficult and specific issues raised by such arbitrations have been the object of abundant case law, derived from both arbitral tribunals and national courts, as well as doctrinal writings. This thorough and up-to-date guide to this area of practice - {{the first and only}} such guide available - provides a comprehensive analysis of all the issues arising from multiparty-multicontract arbitrations, including those involving States and groups of companies. The numerous factors and problems analysed in depth include the following: theories on the basis of which courts and arbitral tribunals determine who are parties to the arbitration clause; whether an arbitration clause may be extended to non-signatories; to what extent one can bring to a single arbitration proceeding the various parties who have participated in a single economic transaction through several contracts; whether a respondent can join other defendants to the arbitration, be they privy to the arbitration agreement or third parties; whether a party to a complex contractual structure can intervene voluntarily in the proceedings; and under what conditions separate arbitration proceedings may be consolidated. It also analyses: how and to what extent one can overcome the inconveniences that arise from having several parallel proceedings; <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators</b> when the various parties to the dispute have divergent interests; res judicata, and in particular whether an arbitral tribunal should take into consideration an arbitral award rendered in a connected arbitration arising from the same project; and enforcement of multiparty-multicontract awards. The author proposes concrete solutions to these problems, and also offers the first analysis of the special issues raised by the latest development in international arbitration, class actions. Features of particular value to the practitioner include in-depth analysis of more than a hundred and twenty ad hoc and institutional awards rendered {{under the auspices of the}} ICC and other institutions; analysis of relevant national case law based on nearly 200 court decisions from the United States, France, Switzerland, England, Australia, Canada, Belgium and other countries; and appendices specifying multiparty-multicontract arbitration clauses, provisions of international conventions, national legislations and institutional rules, and institutional rules on class arbitrations. Corporate counsel, international arbitrators, and lawyers having to deal with multiparty-multicontract disputes will find this book of immeasurable value in their day-to-day work. Law professors and students of dispute resolution have here a unique consideration of an increasingly salient aspect of current international practice...|$|E
40|$|U komparativnom pravu i sudskoj praksi vrlo su česti sporovi u kojima dioničari i drugi ulagatelji zahtijevaju naknadu štete od uvrštenog dioničkog društva zbog toga jer je ono povrijedilo propise o objavljivanju podataka na tržištu kapitala. U američkom pravu koje je kolijevka kolektivnog parničenja dioničara/ulagatelja u odnosu na uvrštena društva, sve se više spominje arbitraža kao moguće rješenje. Kako se u tim sporovima na aktivnoj strani redovito pojavljuje veliki broj dioničara, a na pasivnoj strani pored samog društva, članovi uprave, nadzornog odbora te širok krug osoba izvan društva (jamac izdanja i sl.), rješavanje ovih sporova arbitražnim putem zahtijeva iznalaženje odgovora na brojna pitanja: od toga jesu li i u kojoj mjeri ti sporovi arbitrabilni, na koji se način može sklopiti valjani arbitražni ugovor u složenim okolnostima višestranačke arbitraže te koje je uvjete u pogledu postupka potrebno ispuniti u provedbi takve u pravilu višestranačke arbitraže. Također se iznose specifičnosti koje postoje u pogledu izvođenja dokaza, te prepreke na koje stranke u takvim višestranačkim arbitražama nailaze u etapi priznanja i ovrhe. Način na koji se ta pitanja prelamaju u našem pravu, uzevši u obzir različite pristupe u komparativnom pravu, predmet je ovog rada. Disputes {{in which}} {{shareholders}} and other investors sue listed joint stock companies for damages {{for failing to}} fulfill the obligation to disclose information on the capital market may take many different forms. There may be failure to disclose on the primary market (the prospectus) {{as well as on}} the secondary market (periodical and ad hoc disclosures). This may consist of failure to disclose truthful or timely information. On the claimant 2 ̆ 7 s side there may be a large number of shareholders or other investors since these are companies with a dispersed corporate structure. On the respondent 2 ̆ 7 s side, apart from persons within the company (the company itself, the management and the members of the supervisory board) there may also be third persons, i. e. those from outside the company (interpreters, auditors, etc). The specific character of such disputes is that the court 2 ̆ 7 s decision on the merits of the case, i. e. whether the company is liable for the violation of the duty to disclose, ought to have a binding effect on all investors because they would be in a procedural position of unique joinders. In view of the unique joindership on the claimant 2 ̆ 7 s side, particular jurisdictions have developed collective suits for the protection of investors rights, such as class action. Some countries of the continental circle have introduced legislation, trying to solve these probems in the spirit of the continental procedural law tradition. The latest trend observed in US law is the idea that such disputes should be resolved through arbitration. While considering such matters in the context of Croatian civil procedural law, we have concluded that the matter of the jurisdiction of the court for settling such disputes will depend on the status of the plaintiff, and, therefore, we consider that this matter should de lege ferenda fall within the jurisdiction of commercial courts as specialized courts. If this conclusion could not be drawn from the interpretation of existing regulations (a broader interpretation of the concept of „membership rights“), then a legislative intervention would be required. As far as concerns the arbitrability ratione materiae in such disputes, the authors are of the opinion that they are arbitrable, although mandatory and non-mandatory rules overlap in this area. The decisive criterion is the disponibility of the disputed claim, which is usually understood as a possibility to settle a dispute, which in the author 2 ̆ 7 s opinion is possible in such disputes. Since there is no exclusive court jurisdiction in such disputes, there is no (objective) barrier to arbitrability. As regards the request that the arbitration agreement should be in written form, the arbitration clause contained in the joint stock company 2 ̆ 7 s charter could be the best solution and would be binding on all shareholders, the management and members of the supervisory board, and also on the legal successors of shareholders, regardless of the fact that agreements on the selling of shares are reached informally, not necessarily in written form. The problem of establishing the jurisdiction of the arbitration tribunal exists when the jurisdiction of the tribunal should be extended to persons outside the company. We may assume that the issuer may agree to establish arbitration clauses with such a person in the relevant main contracts, but the question which arises is whether on the basis of such arbitration clauses arbitration proceedings could be instituted for all the interested parties, and whether these already initiated proceedings can be consolidated, especially among those parties which do not have direct contractual relations. That is why it is advisable to have consent on multy-party arbitration in each separate main contract and build it into all the arbitration clauses. The issuer, who is the only one connected with all the other parties in such potential arbitration proceedings, and in control of the situation, must make sure that the clauses are worded in such a way as to cover the expected field of application of ratione paersonae i ratione materiae. In view of the reality of multy-party arbitration and consolidation of the proceedings, it would be better to select the jurisdiction of the arbitration institution rather than ad hoc arbitration, because many of the proceedural issues could be resolved by agreeing on the arbitration rules of the respective arbitration institutions (<b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators,</b> consolidation of proceedings). All the potential co-plaintiffs should be given the possibility to participate in proceedings, which then inevitably raises the question of keeping them informed. Apart from the company 2 ̆ 7 s official bulletin, another way of keeping shareholders (investors) informed about the on-going arbitration proceedings is by using the official register of prescribed information, established by the Law on the Capital Market. Die Rechtsstreitigkeiten, in denen Aktionäre und andere Anleger von einer börsennotierten Gesellschaft Schadenersatz verlangen, weil diese die kapitalmarktlichen Publizitätspflichten verletzt hat, können vielerlei Form haben. Es kann zur Verletzung der Pflichten auf dem Primärmarkt (Prospekt) sowie auf dem Sekundärmarkt (periodische und Ad-hoc-Mitteilungen) gekommen sein. Die Verletzung kann in der fehlerhaften oder nicht rechtzeitigen Veröffentlichung von Daten bestehen. Auf der Aktivseite kann eine große Anzahl von Aktionären und anderen Anlegern in Erscheinung treten, da es sich um Gesellschaften mit einer dispersierten korporativen Struktur handelt. Auf der Passivseite können neben Personen innerhalb der Gesellschaft (der Gesellschaft selbst, Vorständen und Aufsichtsräten) auch Dritte, Außenstehende auftreten. Das Spezifikum solcher Rechtsstreitigkeiten liegt darin, dass die Entscheidung des Gerichts über die Frage, ob die Gesellschaft für die Verletzung haftbar zu machen ist (weil sie etwa einen fehlerhaften Prospekt veröffentlicht hat) dieselbe Wirkung gegen alle Anleger entfalten müsste, denen in diesem Teil wohl die Rolle von Streitgenossen zukäme. Wegen der Streitgenossenschaft insbesondere auf der Aktivseite haben einige Rechtssysteme kollektive Schutzmechanismen für die Rechte der Anleger vorgesehen, wie etwa die class action, bzw. die Sammelklage, während einige Länder der kontinentalen Tradition Vorschriften erlassen haben, mit denen sie versuchen, die Probleme im Sinne der kontinentalen Prozessrechtstradition zu beseitigen. Die neueste Tendenz, die im Recht der USA zum Tragen kommt, besagt, dass solche Streitigkeiten vor dem Schiedsgericht beigelegt werden sollten. Vor dem Hintergrund des kroatischen Rechtes kommen wir bezüglich dieser Fragen zu dem Schluss, dass die gerichtliche Zuständigkeit für solche Streitigkeiten (Handels- oder Amtsgericht) vom Status des Klägers abhängt, weshalb unseres Erachtens die Frage de lege ferenda durch die Erklärung der Zuständigkeit der Handelsgerichte als Fachgerichte zu klären ist. Sollte dies aus der Auslegung der positiven Vorschriften nicht abzuleiten sein (erweitertes Verständnis der Konzeption der „Gesellschafterrechte“), wäre ein gesetzgeberischer Eingriff erforderlich. Hinsichtlich der (objektiven) Arbitrabilität dieser Streitigkeiten, stehen die Autorinnen auf dem Standpunkt, dass sie arbitrabel sind, obwohl in diesem Bereich zwingende und dispositive Vorschriften miteinander vermischt sind. Das entscheidende Kriterium ist die Disponibilität des Streitgegenstandes, die gewöhnlich als Möglichkeit, einen Vergleich zu schließen, aufgefasst wird, was bei diesen Streitigkeiten möglich ist. Da es bei diesen Streitigkeiten keine ausschließliche Zuständigkeit eines Gerichtes gibt, so steht eine solche auch der (objektiven) Arbitrabilität nicht im Wege. Für die Forderung, dass der Schiedsgerichtsvertrag in schriftlicher Form vorliegen muss, könnte eine Schiedsgerichtsklausel in der Satzung der Aktiengesellschaft die beste Lösung sein, die für alle Aktionäre, Vorstands- und Aufsichtsratsmitglieder und auch die Rechtsnachfolger der Aktionäre verbindlich wäre, ungeachtet der formlosen Aktienverkaufsverträge, die nicht in schriftlicher Form abgeschlossen werden. Das Problem, ein Schiedsgericht für zuständig zu erklären, kommt in Bezug auf Dritte stärker zum Ausdruck. Wir können davon ausgehen, dass der Emittent mit solchen Personen in den jeweiligen Hauptverträgen Schiedgerichtsklauseln vereinbaren kann, doch es stellt sich die Frage, ob man mit all diesen Subjekten aufgrund solcher Schiedsgerichtsklauseln ein einheitliches Schiedsgerichtsverfahren führen kann und ob bereits aufgenommene Verfahren dieser Art konsolidiert werden können, insbesondere zwischen jenen Parteien, die nicht in einem unmittelbaren Rechtsverhältnis stehen. Daher ist es empfehlenswert, in alle Schiedsgerichtsklauseln die Zustimmung zu einem Mehrparteienschiedsgericht aufzunehmen. Der Emittent, der als einziger mit allen anderen Parteien in einem solchen potentiellen Schiedsgerichtsverfahren verbunden ist, müsste darauf achten, dass die Redaktion dieser Klauseln den erwarteten Anwendungsbereich ratione personae und ratione materiae erfasst. Mit Blick auf die reale Möglichkeit eines Mehrparteienschiedsgerichtes und der Verfahrenskonsolidierung ist es besser, die Zuständigkeit einer schiedsgerichtlichen Institution zu wählen, da viele Verfahrensfragen nach im Vorhinein festgelegten, in den Handbüchern der jeweiligen Schiedsgerichtsinstitutionen vorgesehen Regeln geklärt werden können (Wahl des Schiedsrichters, Verfahrenszusammenlegung). Allen potentiellen Streitgenossen sollte die Möglichkeit offen stehen, sich an dem Verfahren zu beteiligen, was die Frage ihrer obligatorischen Benachrichtigung aufwirft. Außer dem Gesellschaftsorgan könnte zur Benachrichtigung der Aktionäre (Anleger) von dem eingeleiteten Schiedsgerichtsverfahren auch das amtliche Register für Pflichtinformationen dienen, das aufgrund des Gesetzes über den Kapitalmarkt eingerichtet wurde...|$|E

Išanalizavus straipsnyje aptariamus klausimus, autorius daro išvadą, kad LR komercinio arbitražo įstatymo nuostatos, reglamentuojančios arbitro skyrimą su teismo pagalba, turėtų būti aiškinamos plečiamai, kaip sudarančios prielaidas teismui paskirti arbitrą ne tik ad hoc arbitražo atveju, tačiau ir instituciniame arbitraže, kadangi priešingas įstatymo normų aiškinimas gali padaryti arbitražo procesą neįmanomą. Autorius taip pat daro išvadą, kad prieš paskirdamas arbitrą, teismas turėtų suteikti paskutinę galimybę ginčo šaliai pačiai įgyvendinti savo teisę ir pareigą skirti arbitrą. Ir tik pasyviajai šaliai to nepadarius, pats paskirti nepriklausomą, nešališką ir kvalifikuotą ginčo sprendėją. Arbitrator’s {{appointment}} {{is usually}} {{one of the}} most crucial aspects of arbitration, maybe even the most important after arbitration agreement itself. However, there are cases when arbitrator cannot be appointed in accordance with the agreed appointment mechanism. Therefore, both international and national laws foresee rules regulating the issue <b>of</b> <b>arbitrator’s</b> <b>appointment.</b> One <b>of</b> the possible scenarios to appoint arbitrator is to apply to a national court with a request <b>of</b> <b>appointment.</b> This scenario is also foreseen in Lithuanian law on Commercial Arbitration. The subject-matter {{of this article is to}} analyse the issues related to the role of the courts in arbitration proceedings when the court is requested to appoint the arbitrator. When UNCITRAL adopted its new Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration in 2006, Lithuania amended its Law on Commercial Arbitration in 2012. This new law provides for modern approach towards court assistance to arbitration and allows national court to help arbitration proceedings by appointing arbitrator. Nevertheless, after four years of the application of this new law, there is almost no case-law on the issue. However, the popularity of arbitration is growing in Lithuania. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse in what situations and on what grounds the court may assist arbitration proceedings. Analysis of the subject-matter of this article will be useful for both arbitration scholars and practitioners. In particular, the author examines cases when parties to arbitration proceedings have the right to apply to the court to appoint an arbitrator. The author also analyses which courts are competent in solving this category of disputes as well as whether the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrator</b> in the court has any influence on the recognition or recourse proceedings. In order to reveal the subject-matter of this article author examines various situations which arise or may arise in the practice. The doctrine of foreign countries as well as case-law is the main source of this article. Legal regulation of Lithuania is compared to the regulation of foreign countries. After examining the abovementioned questions, author concludes that the provisions on <b>arbitrator’s</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> the Law on Commercial Arbitration should be interpreted broadly. In author’s opinion, court assistance to arbitration in arbitrator’s appointment should be possible not only in ad hoc arbitration but also when institutional arbitration is chosen because different interpretation of the law could make arbitration proceedings impossible. The author also concludes, that before appointing the arbitrator, the court should suggest, for the last time, the party to arbitration to appoint the arbitrator. Only if the passive party refuses to fulfil its duty, the court should appoint independent, neutral and qualified arbitrator...|$|R
