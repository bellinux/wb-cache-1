2500|$|In December 2003, EastEnders made {{headlines}} in the UK press after they screened a kiss between Kelly and Zoe. The storyline was featured in a New Year's Eve episode that was filmed on-location in Scotland. In the storyline, a group of teenagers travel from London to Scotland for New Year's Eve, but their minibus crashes, leaving them stranded and injured on the freezing cold Scottish moors. While stranded, Kelly cares for an injured Zoe, they become over-emotional, and kiss. Kinsella explained the reasons behind the kiss: [...] "They're stuck in the hills, thinking they're going to die—it's {{a way of saying}} goodbye and also of showing how much they love each other as friends. Which is quite sweet really." [...] She claimed that the kiss was made easier {{due to the fact that}} she was kissing her off-screen best friend: [...] "That made it so much easier. We thought we were just going to be laughing and giggling the whole way through, but we were very professional. It was so cold that we just wanted to get it over with. We were shaking from cold—not from nerves—and it was raining, so we just thought, 'Let's do it <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> with'. [...] We laugh about it now. When it came down to it, the truth was that it was just like any other screen kiss." [...] The episode featuring their kiss attracted [...] 9.5million viewers, and the precise moment that they kissed was watched by 44% of the available viewing audience.|$|E

On November 6, 1967, she became {{secretary and}} executive assistant to Robert R. Wilson, the founding director of the National Accelerator Laboratory, and served in that capacity until December 31, 1972. Duffield likened this job to working for Oppenheimer at Los Alamos: [...] "There was the same close feeling of a group of people in a strange land, ... {{a group of people who}} were isolated from the rest of the world and trying to do something special." [...] Duffield said that moving to the Weston site evoked memories of the esprit de corps at Los Alamos, and [...] "that <b>did</b> really make <b>it</b> a frontier." [...] She also recalled The feeling of independence and adventure in those early days on the Weston site. [...] "We had a flagpole and a big fancy colorful tent was put alongside the house" [...] As she explained, [...] "It was a place to sit and have a meeting: but it also [...] "was a symbol." [...] And at both labs, [...] "everyone did sort of everything—there was a crisis every day." [...] Duffield emphasized: [...] "Bob managed to give people the feeling of tremendous urgency, of getting the thing <b>done</b> <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> fast <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> cheap." [...] Later, secretary Barb (Rozic) Kristen recalled that many new employees considered it hard to know just what to do in those early days, but Duffield, unlike everyone else, knew exactly what was needed <b>and</b> how to <b>get</b> things done.|$|R

5000|$|In April 1995, Alice in Chains entered Bad Animals Studio in Seattle with {{producer}} Toby Wright, who {{had previously}} worked with Corrosion of Conformity and Slayer. Few of the songs on the album had been written before the sessions began, so Cantrell's material {{was used as a}} starting point. The band would then give the demo tapes to Staley so he could write lyrics. The album was finished in August 1995. Cantrell said, [...] "It was often depressing, <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> felt like pulling hair out, but it was the fucking coolest thing, and I'm glad to have gone through it.

Sometimes, however, the magistrates are frankly outspoken about the matter, and censure the prisoners for the slackness of their attempts. For instance Mr. R.

60|$|Well, {{there you}} are; a young {{tradesman}} beginning {{the world without}} capital. Capital, though it's a bugbear, nevertheless it's a virtue. Therefore, as you haven't got it, you must assume it. That's credit. Credit I take to be the belief of other people in a thing that doesn't really exist. When you go into your friend Smith's house, and find Mrs. S. all smiles, you give her credit for the sweetest of tempers. Your friend S. knows better; but then you see she's had wit enough to obtain credit. When I draw a bill at three months, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>done,</b> I do the same thing. That's credit. Give me credit enough, and I don't care a brass button for capital. If I could have but one wish, I would never ask a fairy {{for a second or}} a third.

We had a couple of meetings and I came up with this idea. The day I met with him, I had had an MRI for my neck, and they make that really scary sound. I was like, 'I just had this MRI, and when I was in there, I was thinking about the aliens, and it was really scary.' And he was like, 'Oh, that's awesome!' He went and recorded MRIs and made music out of MRIs, and that's the theme of the aliens in our film. He is no drama, and just goes <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> <b>it</b> <b>done.</b> The score is big and awesome and scary and driving. At times, it's very simple and acoustic and touching and emotional.
