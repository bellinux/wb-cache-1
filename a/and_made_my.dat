500|$|Bach {{composed}} his cantata {{as part of}} {{his application}} for the position of [...] in Leipzig, the official title being [...] (Cantor and Director of Music). As cantor, he was responsible for the music at four Lutheran churches, the main churches Thomaskirche (St. Thomas) and the Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas), but also the Neue Kirche (New Church) and the Peterskirche (St. Peter). As director of music, the Thomaskantor was Leipzig's [...] "senior musician", responsible for the music on official occasions such as town council elections and homages. Functions related to the university took place at the Paulinerkirche. The position became vacant when Johann Kuhnau died on 5 June 1722. Bach was interested, mentioning as one reason that he saw more possibilities for future academic studies of his sons in Leipzig: [...] "...but this post was described to me in such favorable terms that finally (particularly since my sons seemed inclined to [...] studies) I cast my lot, {{in the name of the}} Lord, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> journey to Leipzig, took my examination, and then made the change of position." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1665, Bashō and Yoshitada {{together}} with some acquaintances composed a hyakuin, or one-hundred-verse renku. In 1666, Yoshitada's sudden death brought Bashō's peaceful {{life as a}} servant to an end. No records of this time remain, but {{it is believed that}} Bashō gave up any possibility of samurai status and left home. Biographers have proposed various reasons and destinations, including the possibility of an affair between Bashō and a Shinto miko named , which is unlikely to be true. Bashō's own references to this time are vague; he recalled that [...] "at one time I coveted an official post with a tenure of land", and that [...] "there was a time when I was fascinated with the ways of homosexual love": there is no indication whether he was referring to real obsessions or fictional ones. He was uncertain whether to become a full-time poet; by his own account, [...] "the alternatives battled in my mind <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> life restless". His indecision may have been influenced by the then still relatively low status of renga and haikai no renga as more social activities than serious artistic endeavors. In any case, his poems continued to be published in anthologies in 1667, 1669, and 1671, and he published a compilation of work by himself and other authors of the Teitoku school, , in 1672. In about the spring of that year he moved to Edo, to further his study of poetry.|$|E

2500|$|Taylor {{said that}} Lucas, who was {{consumed}} by {{the details of the}} complicated production, [...] "avoided all meetings and contact with me from day one, so I read the extra-long script many times <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> own decisions as to how I would shoot the picture." [...] He also [...] "took it upon myself to experiment with photographing the lightsabers and other things onstage before we moved on to our two weeks of location work in Tunisia". Taylor was aware of the [...] "enormous amount of process work" [...] to follow principal photography and believed [...] "a crisp result would help".|$|E
2500|$|When Mrs. Rodenhurst {{told me of}} {{the advent}} to Shrewsbury of Wainwright, I asked her {{if he was in}} his room, or where. 'No,' she said, 'he went out about an hour ago. I think you'll find him in the King's Arms.' I went to the King's Arms <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> very first {{appearance}} in the bar-parlour of a public-house. The room was empty save for one man, dressed in blue serge, with a shrewd lean face. I recognised him. I had seen him playing for Yorkshire at Old Trafford. I introduced myself. 'I'm the assistant pro.,' I explained. 'Art thou?' he replied, 'well, then 'ave a drink wi' me.' I told him I didn't drink — only ginger ale. 'Christ,' he said, 'tha'rt a reight bloody cricketer.' He was a tall man, who walked as though he didn't care a damn for anybody. There was something sinister about him. Every night he got drunk as a matter of course, quietly and masterfully. One day he backed a winner at a glorious price, and towards eleven o'clock that night he and the drill-sergeant of the school arrived arm-in-arm (supporting one another) in the sitting-room of our lodgings. Very gravely Ted introduced me to the drill-sergeant, whom of course I knew very well. The drill-sergeant as gravely introduced Ted to me, then taking my arm, he whispered rather noisily in my ear, 'I'm 'fraid 'e's a l'il drunk, so I've jus' bror him h-home.' Whereupon Ted dissolved into helpless laughter and said, 'My dear sersergeant, don't be 'diculous[...] [...] [...] Bror me home? Why, you ole fool, it's me that's bror you 'ome.' Then (aside), 'E's jus' a l'il drunk, so I've bror him home.' The sergeant hooted with glee. 'Bless m' soul,' he said, 'Ted; jus' lis'en t'me. If you'd bror me home, this would be my lodgin's, see? I would be 'ome, not you. See? But this is your lodgin's—so I mus' 'ave bror you 'ome. See?' ...|$|E

60|$|I {{got past}} him at last, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> way swiftly towards {{the other end}} of the quadrangle.|$|E
60|$|I {{thanked him}} <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> way thither across the {{reception}} hall. The {{answer to my}} question was given at once.|$|E

60|$|I {{deposited}} my napkin on {{the table}} <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> way toward Mr. Bundercombe. I smiled pleasantly at him and bowed apologetically toward his companion.|$|E

5000|$|Oft {{when the}} summer sleeps among the trees,Whisp'ring faint murmurs to the scanty breeze,I walk the village round; if at her sideA youth doth walk in stolen joy and pride,I curse my stars in bitter grief <b>and</b> woe,That <b>made</b> <b>my</b> love so high, and me so low.|$|R
5000|$|Pornographer David Hurles {{wrote that}} [...] "Rechy's story set me free... His story {{told me of}} a world I had only hoped might really exist.

60|$|I {{did then}} what {{might seem to}} be a callous thing. I left them all {{crowding}} around the body of the dead man. I let even Felicia be led back to her room by her companion. I took the lift downstairs, <b>and</b> I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> way into the cafe.|$|R
60|$|She {{received}} this with another and more indignant 'Pah!' <b>and</b> I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> {{way out of}} her room (I think I felt my way out with my hands, although my eyes were open), almost suspecting that my voice had a repulsive sound, and that I was a repulsive object.|$|R
