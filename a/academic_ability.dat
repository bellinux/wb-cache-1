25|$|The {{experiences}} {{children go}} through {{during times of}} armed conflict can impede their ability to learn in an educational setting. Schools experience drop-outs of refugee and immigrant students from an array of factors such as: rejection by peers, low self-esteem, antisocial behavior, negative perceptions of their <b>academic</b> <b>ability,</b> and lack of support from school staff and parents. Because refugees come from various regions globally with their own cultural, religious, linguistic, and home practices, the new school culture can conflict with the home culture, causing tension between the student and their family.|$|E
25|$|According to McAdams, the White {{middle class}} {{community}} accepted minority percentages of around 50% for elementary schools, and for {{middle and high}} schools the White community accepted minority percentages of over 70 because classes at those levels were separated by <b>academic</b> <b>ability.</b> If percentages of minorities exceeded the tolerable levels at a particular school, white parents withdrew their children from the said school until there were few White people left. According to McAdams, HISD administrators knew about the levels of minority percentages tolerable to White middle class parents.|$|E
25|$|Although lead is {{the least}} {{expensive}} dense (SG=11.34) material available, it is a toxic substance causing biological damage to wildlife and humans. The Centers for Disease Control has stated that no safe level of lead exposure in children has been determined, and that once lead has been absorbed into the body, its effects cannot be corrected. Even a very small amount of exposure causes a permanent reduction in intelligence, ability to focus attention, and <b>academic</b> <b>ability.</b> Lead can be inhaled or ingested as either a metal powder or powdered corrosion products, however most lead salts have very low solubility in water, and pure lead corrodes very slowly in seawater. Absorption through skin is not likely for metallic lead and inorganic corrosion products.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies how {{schooling}} admission tests affect {{economic performance}} {{in an economy}} where individuals are endowed with both academic and non <b>academic</b> <b>abilities</b> and both abilities matter for labor productivity. We develop a simple model with selective government held schools, where individuals signal their abilities by taking an admission test that sorts them into different schools. When abilities are poorly correlated in the population, as documented in the literature, a standard test based only on <b>academic</b> <b>abilities</b> {{is expected to be}} less efficient than a more balanced test, that considers both ability types. Contrary to this expectation, we show that this is not generally true, but depends both on the distribution of abilities in the population and on the marginal contribution of each ability type to individual productivity. It is also not generally true that the outcome of a more balanced test can be replicated by a sequential testing strategy, with government held schools testing <b>academic</b> <b>abilities</b> and firms testing non <b>academic</b> <b>abilities</b> on the sub-sample of graduates of elite schools...|$|R

25|$|Other {{innovations}} in enrollment practices, included allowing {{colleges and universities}} to admit students with good academic records but relatively low entrance-examination scores. Some colleges were allowed to try an experimental student recommendation system - fixed at 2 {{percent of the total}} enrollment for regular colleges and 5 percent for teachers' colleges - instead of the traditional entrance examination. A minimum national examination score was established for admission to specific departments at specially designated colleges and universities, and the minimum score for admission to other universities was set by provincial-level authorities. Key universities established separate classes for minorities. When several applicants attained the minimum test score, the school had the option of making a selection, a policy that gave university faculty and administrators a certain amount of discretion but still protected admission according to <b>academic</b> <b>ability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Beyond sex {{differences}} in <b>academic</b> <b>ability,</b> recent research has also been focusing on women’s underrepresentation in higher education, especially {{in the fields of}} natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Nonetheless, 2011 data on earned doctorates in the United States by the National Science Foundation shows female representation in all of academia varies, not just in STEM subjects. For example, in 2011, women earned 54% of molecular biology PhDs but less than 20% in physics (STEM). In humanities and social sciences, women earned over 70% of psychology PhDs, but only 30% in philosophy. A 2015 study published in the Journal of Women in Science explained these patterns of female under-representation across academic disciplines, using the field-specific ability beliefs hypothesis, which claims that women are underrepresented in fields whose practitioners believe that raw, innate talent is the main requirement for success, because women are stereotyped as not possessing such talent. The study, conducted on 1820 academics from 30 different disciplines, found that the more a particular field values gifted-ness, the fewer the female PhDs in that discipline. According to the researchers, “emphasis on raw aptitude may activate negative stereotypes in women’s own minds, making them vulnerable to stereotype threat”.|$|E

50|$|Academic {{self-concept}} {{refers to}} the personal beliefs about their <b>academic</b> <b>abilities</b> or skills.

500|$|Students {{successful}} in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with scholarships and exhibitions, normally {{the result of}} a long-standing endowment, although since the introduction of tuition fees the amounts of money available are purely nominal.

500|$|Denis Rendall {{took over}} in 1970, {{at a time when}} the future of the school was under threat from the Circular 10/65, which {{proposed}} the abolition of grammar schools, which select pupils according to their <b>academic</b> <b>ability,</b> in favour of the comprehensive schools, which are non-selective state funded schools. He oversaw the building of the new art and crafts department building, currently the R.E. block, which opened in May 1974, and the purchase of a neighbouring detached house, 10Brook Street, by the Kent Education Committee. Known as [...] "Lawton's", this building is now used by the economics and business departments and for music technology. Rendall experienced a high turnover of staff: 31 teachers were at the school in the year of his arrival, and 43 joined and left the school between 1970 and 1986. He increased the number of female staff from zero to seven during his tenure, and the student body grew from 463 to 746 during these years.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{evidence}} of considerable <b>academic</b> <b>ability,</b> Reed {{did not follow}} his brother Charles, who went on from the school to Trinity College, Cambridge. Instead, in 1869, Reed left the school to join the family firm, known as Sir Charles Reed & Sons or informally as the Fann Street Foundry, beginning a lifelong association with the printing trade. He found time, however, to pursue many other interests, physical, artistic and intellectual. Twice he walked the [...] from London to Cambridge, each time leaving on Friday afternoon and arriving at St John's College for breakfast on Saturday. Reed was a competent swimmer, and won a Royal Humane Society medal for saving a cousin from drowning in rough seas. He was an accomplished pianist, a skilful pen-and-ink illustrator, and had an engaging style of writing. These artistic talents were put to service {{in the production of}} a family magazine, The Earlsfield Chronicle, which Reed edited (and largely wrote) from the mid-1870s.
