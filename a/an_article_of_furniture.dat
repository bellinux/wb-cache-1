Never had <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> seemed more hateful in Lancelot's eyes. Comus could well remember the time when a chair stuck {{in the middle of}} a room had seemed to him the most horrible of manufactured things.|$|E
6000|$|The servant {{was still}} waiting--not {{like a human}} being who took an {{interest}} in the proceedings, but (as became a perfectly bred footman) like <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> artfully constructed to come and go at the word of command. Julian gave the word of command, addressing the admirably constructed automaton by the name of [...] "James." ...|$|E
60|$|There is {{no telling}} {{the love of}} a Tahitian for a sailor's trunk. So {{ornamental}} is it held as <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> in the hut, that the women are incessantly tormenting their husbands to bestir themselves and make them a present of one. When obtained, no pier-table just placed in a drawing-room is regarded with half the delight. For these reasons, then, our coming into possession of our estate at this time was an important event.|$|E

60|$|Elizabeth was adorably patient. She surreptitiously drew {{towards her}} a cane chair, <b>a</b> doubtful-looking <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> upon which she seated herself slowly {{and with great}} care.|$|R
50|$|Before the mid-eighteenth {{century the}} commode had become such <b>a</b> {{necessary}} <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> {{that it might}} be made in menuiserie (carpentry), of solid painted oak, walnut or fruitwoods, with carved decoration, typical <b>of</b> French provincial <b>furniture.</b>|$|R
60|$|The frightened girl, who {{had never}} before {{witnessed}} so plain evidence of desperation in her companion, had sunk upon <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> speechless. The look of the prisoner changed {{from one to the}} other, and he made an effort to rise, but debility caused him to fall backwards, and not till then did Jacopo perceive the impracticability, on many accounts, of what, in a moment of excitement, he had proposed. A long silence followed. The hard breathing of Jacopo gradually subsided, and the expression of his face changed to its customary settled and collected look.|$|E
60|$|The {{people will}} imitate the nobles, {{and the result}} is a {{thorough}} diffusion of the proper feeling. But in America, the coins current being the sole arms of the aristocracy, their display may be said, in general, to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction; and the populace, looking always upward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. In short, the cost of <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> has at length come to be, with us, nearly the sole test of its merit in a decorative point of view--and this test, once established, has led the way to many analogous errors, readily traceable to the one primitive folly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} the strange {{creature}} in the kitchen may account for it. The man was a primitive savage from the backwoods of San Pedro, and this was his fetish. When his companion and he had fled to some prearranged retreat--already occupied, no doubt by a confederate--the companion had persuaded him to leave so compromising <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture.</b> But the mulatto's heart was with it, and he was driven back to it next day, when, on reconnoitering through the window, he found policeman Walters in possession. He waited three days longer, and then his piety or his superstition drove him to try once more. Inspector Baynes, who, with his usual astuteness, had minimized the incident before me, had really recognized its importance and had left a trap into which the creature walked. Any other point, Watson?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{apartment}} did {{not contain}} <b>a</b> single <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture.</b> One small window admitted the light, and this was so heavily barred with wooden uprights that even with a sharp saw considerable time would have been required for the prisoner to cut through.|$|R
60|$|A lath-and-plaster {{partition}} {{had been}} {{run across the}} passage six feet from the end, with a door cunningly concealed in it. It was lit within by slits under the eaves. <b>A</b> few <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> and <b>a</b> supply {{of food and water}} were within, together with a number of books and papers.|$|R

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, the little saloon, with the dressing-room and bed-room of la belle Barbérie, {{were in a}} state of the most studied arrangement. Not <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> was displaced, a door ajar, or a window open. The {{pavilion}} had evidently been quitted by its ordinary passage, and the door had been closed in the customary manner, without using the fastenings. The bed had evidently not been entered, for the linen was smooth and untouched. In short, so complete was the order of the place, that, yielding to a powerful natural feeling, the Alderman called aloud on his truant niece, by name, as if he expected to see her appear from some place, in which she had secreted her person, in idle sport. But this touching expedient was vain. The voice sounded hollow through the deserted rooms; and though all waited long to listen, there came no playful or laughing answer back.|$|E
60|$|But the nakedness of the {{exterior}} was as {{nothing to the}} nakedness of the interior. When Herbert entered, followed by his horse, his eye glanced round the dark place, {{and it seemed to}} be empty of everything. There was no fire on the hearth, though a fire on the hearth is the easiest of all luxuries for an Irishman to acquire, and the last which he is willing to lose. There was not <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> in the whole place; neither chairs, nor table, nor bed, nor dresser; there was there neither dish, nor cup, nor plate, nor even the iron pot in which all the cookery of the Irish cottiers' menage is usually carried on. Beneath his feet was the damp earthen floor, and around him were damp, cracked walls, and over his head was the old lumpy thatch, through which the water was already dropping; but inside was to be seen none of those articles of daily use which are usually {{to be found in the}} houses even of the poorest.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Coulson {{was not a}} {{man whose}} {{acquaintance}} it was difficult to make. From five to seven every afternoon, scorning the attractions of the band outside and the generally festive air which pervaded the great tea rooms, he sat {{at the corner of the}} bar upon <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> which resembled more than anything else an office stool, dividing his attention between desultory conversation with any other gentleman who might be indulging in a drink, and watching the billiards in which some of his compatriots were usually competing. It was not, so far as one might judge, a strenuous life which Mr. Coulson was leading. He had been known once or twice to yawn, and he had somewhat the appearance of a man engaged in an earnest but at times not altogether successful attempt to kill time. Perhaps for that reason he made acquaintances with a little more than his customary freedom. There was a young Englishman, for instance, whose name, it appeared, was Gaynsforth, with whom, after a drink or two at the bar, he speedily became on almost intimate terms.|$|E
60|$|The day passed uneventfully. Rand busied {{himself in}} his usual avocations, and {{constructed}} a temporary shelter for himself and Sol beside the shaft, besides rudely shaping <b>a</b> few necessary <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> for Mrs. Sol.|$|R
2500|$|Gong'an {{was itself}} {{originally}} <b>a</b> metaphor—an <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> {{that came to}} denote legal precedents. For example, Di Gong'an (...) is the original title of Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee, the famous Chinese detective novel based on a historical Tang dynasty judge. Similarly, Zen kōan collections are public records of the notable sayings and actions of Zen disciples and masters attempting to pass on their teachings.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{from what}} was casually dropped, I think Mrs. Manston had <b>a</b> few <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> she didn't want, {{and when she was}} leaving they were put in a sale just by. Amongst her things were two workboxes very much alike. One of these she {{intended}} to sell, the other she didn't, and Mr. Brown, who collected the things together, took the wrong one to the sale.' ...|$|R
60|$|Two cigars {{a day at}} ninepence apiece come to £27 7s. 6d. yearly, {{and four}} ounces of tobacco a week at nine shillings a pound come to £5 17s. yearly. That makes £33 4s. 6d. When we {{calculate}} the yearly expense of tobacco in this way, we are naturally taken aback, and our extravagance shocks us more after we have considered how much more satisfactorily the money might have been spent. With £33 4s. 6d. you can buy new Oriental rugs for the drawing-room, {{as well as a}} spring bonnet and a nice dress. These are things that give permanent pleasure, whereas you have no interest in a cigar after flinging away the stump. Judging by myself, I should say that it was want of thought rather than selfishness that makes heavy smokers of so many bachelors. Once a man marries, his eyes are opened to many things that he was quite unaware of previously, among them being the delight of adding <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> to the drawing-room every month, and having a bedroom in pink and gold, the door of which is always kept locked. If men would only consider that every cigar they smoke would buy part of a new piano-stool in terra-cotta plush, and that for every pound tin of tobacco purchased away goes a vase for growing dead geraniums in, they would surely hesitate. They do not consider, however, until they marry, and then they are forced to it. For my own part, I fail to see why bachelors should be allowed to smoke as much as they like, when we are debarred from it.|$|E

6000|$|When I {{returned}} to-day {{from the}} College, I {{was surprised to}} see a broad grin distending the adust countenance of the faithful James Wilkinson, which, as the circumstance seldom happens above once a year, was matter of some surprise. Moreover, he had a knowing glance with his eye, which I should have as soon expected from <b>a</b> dumb-waiter--an <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> to which James, in his usual state, may be happily assimilated. 'What the devil is the matter, James?' ...|$|R
60|$|As we have said, Mrs Donaldson's little cottage {{stood behind}} {{that of her}} son Ivor. It was very small, {{consisting}} of only one apartment with a box bed and <b>a</b> few <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> old <b>furniture,</b> the most cherished {{of which was a}} little clock with a staring face, and a poor landscape on it.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the church makes for fascinating history. Whether it is <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> the chalices, the memorial tablets or the Baptism registers - they all tell a story. The story is not only about Guyana's history, but glimpses of its Caribbean neighbours are also revealed. There is a small Gothic shrine of carved oak in the northern aisle that commemorates Bishop Coleridge, first Bishop of Barbados, {{who was responsible for}} British Guiana from 1826 to 1842. The brass lectern, near the central altar, was given by the Diocese of Barbados when the present Cathedral was opened in 1892. The Sedilia was donated by Chinese Christians.|$|E
5000|$|... "Not <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> was left, {{except a}} bedstead; a single glass bottle {{was the only}} {{drinking}} utensil; and one ham was {{all that remained of}} the provisions, having by good fortune, been hung in an obscure part of the cellar. This disaster, and the inconveniences to which she was obliged to submit in consequence, were borne with fortitude, and even formed subject of merriment. Soon after, she was called upon by two of the American officers — Putnam and Webb — who asked how she had fared, not supposing she had been visited with annoyance, and were much surprised at her description {{of the state of the}} house on her return. The General promised, if she would be satisfied with army conveniences, to send her the next day a complete outfit to recommence housekeeping. On the morrow a horseman arrived, carrying a bag on either side, filled with all kinds of woodenware — a welcome and useful present for such things were not at that time easy to be obtained. Some of these articles were still in the house at the time of Mrs. Beekman’s decease." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{then settled}} down to maté and quiet conversation. Sitting in the kitchen on the skull <b>of</b> <b>a</b> horse--a common <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> in <b>an</b> Oriental rancho--was a boy about twelve years old, one of Lucero's grandchildren, with a very {{beautiful}} face. His feet were bare and his clothes very poor, but his soft dark eyes and olive face had that tender, half-melancholy expression often seen in children of Spanish origin, which is always so strangely captivating.|$|R
60|$|In this desolate {{apartment}} in which Mr. Pinto had {{invited me to}} see him, there were three chairs, one bottomless, a little table on which you might put a breakfast-tray, and not <b>a</b> single other <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture.</b> In the next room, the door of which was open, I could see a magnificent gilt dressing-case, with some splendid diamond and ruby shirt-studs lying by it, and a chest of drawers, and a cupboard apparently full of clothes.|$|R
60|$|January 20th.--Mr. Steele, {{a gentleman}} of Rock Ferry, showed {{me this morning}} a pencil-case {{formerly}} belonging to Dr. Johnson. It is six or seven inches long, of large calibre, and very clumsily manufactured of iron, perhaps plated in its better days, but now quite bare. Indeed, it looks as rough as <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>of</b> kitchen <b>furniture.</b> The intaglio on the end is a lion rampant. On the whole, it well became Dr. Johnson to have used such a stalwart pencil-case. It had a six-inch measure {{on a part of}} it, so that it must have been at least eight inches long. Mr. Steele says he has seen a cracked earthen teapot, of large size, in which Miss Williams used to make tea for Dr. Johnson.|$|R
60|$|I fell ill. It {{must have}} been some time in April, but I kept no count of days. Nobody came near me, nobody knew of me. I {{occupied}} a room {{at the top of a}} huge block of workmen's dwellings. A woman who kept a second-hand store had lent me for a shilling a week <b>a</b> few <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture.</b> Lying upon my chair-bedstead, I listened to the shrill sounds around me, that through the light and darkness never ceased. A pint of milk, left each morning on the stone landing, kept me alive. I would wait for the man's descending footsteps, then crawl to the door. I hoped I was going to die, regretting my returning strength, the desire for food that drove me out into the streets again.|$|R
6000|$|But {{no sooner}} had he set off {{as fast as he}} could run, towards the chapel, than Jeanie started in an {{opposite}} direction, over high and low, on the nearest path homeward. Her juvenile exercise as a herdswoman had put [...] "life and mettle" [...] in her heels, and never had she followed Dustiefoot, when the cows were in the corn, with half so much speed as she now cleared the distance betwixt Muschat's Cairn and her father's cottage at St. Leonard's. To lift the latch--to enter--to shut, bolt, and double bolt the door--to draw against it <b>a</b> heavy <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> (which she could not have moved in a moment of less energy), so as to make yet farther provision against violence, was almost the work of a moment, yet done with such silence as equalled the celerity.|$|R
6000|$|Nor are the Hanover womankind his Majesty {{has about}} him, quasi-wives or not, of a soul-entrancing character; far indeed from that. Two in chief there are, a fat and a lean: the lean, called [...] "Maypole" [...] by the English populace, is [...] "Duchess of Kendal," [...] with {{excellent}} pension, in the English Peeragy; Schulenburg the former German name of her; decidedly a quasi-wife (influential, against her will, in that sad Konigsmark Tragedy, at Hanover long since), who is fallen thin and old. [...] "Maypole,"--or bare Hop-pole, with the leaves all stript; lean, long, hard;--though she once had her summer verdures too; and still, {{as an old}} quasi-wife, or were it only as <b>an</b> old <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> has her worth to the royal mind, Schulenburgs, kindred of hers, are high in the military line; some of whom we may meet.|$|R
60|$|His visitor {{had lost}} {{none of his}} embarrassment. The Marquis, in his old-fashioned dinner clothes, his black stock, the fob which hung from his waistcoat, his finely chiselled features, and that mysterious air of being entirely {{in touch with his}} surroundings, had him at a {{disadvantage}} from the first. Borden was wearing the somewhat shabby blue serge suit in which he had travelled all day, and which he had neglected to brush. He had been too much in earnest about his mission to do more than make the most hasty toilet at the hotel. The high-backed chair, which suited the Marquis so well, was <b>an</b> unfamiliar <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> to him, and he sat upon it stiffly and without ease. Nevertheless, he reminded himself that he was there--he must say what he had come to say.|$|R
50|$|And if the {{movement}} was tardy even then, it was still slower in the previous Tudor era — that three-quarters of a century just preceding the precise Elizabethan. In spite <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> Renaissance <b>furniture</b> procured abroad for the royal family {{or some of the}} high nobility, a barbarous mixture of the old and new yet prevailed in England at the period when France enjoyed the accomplished Henry II style, and when Italy reveled in the perfect fantasies of the Italian cinquecento.|$|R
60|$|The lady {{whom they}} had come to see, if she were the present {{occupant}} of the house, appeared to have taken up her quarters there as she might have established herself in an Eastern caravanserai. A small square of carpet {{in the middle of the}} room, <b>a</b> few <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> that evidently did not belong to the room, and a disorder of trunks and travelling articles, formed the whole of her surroundings. Under some former regular inhabitant, the stifling little apartment had broken out into a pier-glass and a gilt table; but the gilding was as faded as last year's flowers, and the glass was so clouded that it seemed to hold in magic preservation all the fogs and bad weather it had ever reflected. The visitors had had a minute or two to look about them, when the door opened and Miss Wade came in.|$|R
60|$|At {{night we}} all {{turned into a}} large room with a clay floor, {{in which there was}} not <b>a</b> single <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture.</b> Our saddles, rugs, and ponchos had all been thrown {{together}} in a corner, and anyone wishing to sleep had to make himself a bed with his own horse-gear and toggery as best he could. The experience was nothing new to me, so I soon made myself a comfortable nest on the floor, and, pulling off my boots, coiled myself up like an opossum that knows nothing better and is friendly with fleas. My friends, however, were evidently bent on making a night of it, and had taken care to provide themselves with three or four bottles of rum. After conversation, with an occasional song, {{had been going on for}} some time, one of them--a Mr. Chillingworth--rose to his feet and demanded silence.|$|R
