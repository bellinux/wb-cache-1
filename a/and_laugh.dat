5|$|Kelly {{admits to}} some problems, while making excuses for her boyfriend, {{such as his}} busy {{schedule}} and her own moodiness. Beyoncé, however, rolls her eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> at the same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin to whisper <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E

25|$|David Bevington {{argues that}} the play {{represents}} {{the dark side of}} love. He writes that the fairies make light of love by mistaking the lovers and by applying a love potion to Titania's eyes, forcing her {{to fall in love with}} an ass. In the forest, both couples are beset by problems. Hermia and Lysander are both met by Puck, who provides some comic relief in the play by confounding the four lovers in the forest. However, the play also alludes to serious themes. At the end of the play, Hippolyta and Theseus, happily married, watch the play about the unfortunate lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe, and are able to enjoy <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> at it. Helena and Demetrius are both oblivious to the dark side of their love, totally unaware of what may have come of the events in the forest.|$|E

Airport AFIS told {{the crew of}} Flight 213 that the weather in the area was thundery with heavy precipitation. The crews acknowledged the report and continued the approach. Flight 213 had only experienced some turbulence while approaching therefore it continued the approach. The Flight crew was still at normal mood condition, as Captain Noor's jokes <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> were heard in the CVR. But a few minutes later, the flight finally encountered bad weather conditions. The flight crew entered bad weather, but still continued the approach, even though Bhoja Air's operational manual told crews to discontinue approach if bad weather was encountered. They continued the approach until finally they realized that they had entered an active cell. At this time, Captain Noor {{was worried about the}} condition, but continued the approach. Autopilot was later disengaged by flight crews. Islamabad Tower then told Flight 213 to land on Runway 30. The landing checklist was completed and done. Flight crews followed the landing procedure on ILS approach. The autopilot later engaged again.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Paul Feig, making it his sixth directorial credit for the series. Eisenberg and Stupnitsky later noted that, because the episode {{was the first to}} be filmed following the strike, there was [...] "a great, loose vibe on set", and as such, many of the actors would break character <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> at the jokes. The majority of the episode took place at Michael's condo. This was the same location used in the second season entry [...] "Office Olympics". Eisenberg and Stupnitsky explained that [...] "the production design team did an amazing job to transform the condo from Michael's design aesthetic to Jan's." ...|$|E

Mr. Burns finally calls a meeting with Homer to concede to their demands on one condition: that Homer resign as union president. Homer celebrates madly, leading Mr. Burns to finally realize that Homer is not the [...] "brilliant tactician" [...] he thought he was.

The [...] "dynamic duo take a saber saw to a glistening new Maybach {{and turn it}} into a tricked-out 'Thunderdome' cruiser, then do doughnuts in a parking lot with a gaggle of models packed in the back." [...] The video [...] "eschews the narrative spazzouts and stoner-boggling tricks of previous Jonze videos" [...] preferring instead to [...] "luxuriate in the icon status of its two principals. We get fireworks, fist bumps, a fast car, and general larger-than-life camaraderie rather than, say, guys on fire running in slow-motion. It's like The Expendables, if that movie only starred two guys, and both of them were rappers who didn't do any onscreen fighting." [...] The car was put up for auction, and the proceeds donated toward the East African Drought Disaster.|$|E

[...] He was complimentary towards Fey here, noting that she [...] "illustrated [...] chops as a physical comedian". Sean Gandert, a contributor for Paste magazine, said that Tracy's plot was [...] "pretty awesome". Gandert, {{who has not been}} a fan of the [...] "Dealbreakers" [...] storyline, appreciated it in this episode, opining it had [...] "good writing even by the show's outsized standards."

500|$|Riegels {{sent letters}} to athletes who made similar mistakes. For example, Riegels {{sent a letter}} to Paramount High School's Jan Bandringa in 1957, who had intercepted a pass only to run it 55 yards into his own end zone, {{resulting}} in a safety for Centennial High, who won the game 9–7. Riegels wrote in the letter: [...] "For many years I've had to go along <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> whenever my wrong-way run was brought up, even though I've grown tired listening and reading about it. But it certainly wasn't the most serious thing in the world. I regretted doing it, even as you do, but you'll get over it." [...] In addition, during an NFL game in 1964 between the Minnesota Vikings and San Francisco 49ers, Minnesota defensive end Jim Marshall ran a recovered fumble 66 yards into his own end zone (resulting in a safety, but the Vikings won 27–22). Riegels reportedly later sent Marshall a letter reading [...] "Welcome to the club".|$|E
500|$|When rehearsing episodes {{four and}} five, the first episodes to be produced, {{director}} Adam Smith suggested that Smith and Gillan [...] "have an adventure" [...] {{where they could}} experience something exciting <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> and scream. He took them to a [...] "real white knuckle ride" [...] on a boat in Cardiff Bay. Filming began on 20 July 2009 on Southerndown beach, Vale of Glamorgan in scenes for [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] and [...] "Flesh and Stone". Moffat wrote that typically with television {{the first day of}} filming [...] "will probably be something fairly inconsequential and involve a minor character getting shot, or a close up of a hand or something" [...] which differed from the [...] "iconic" [...] scene involving the Doctor, Amy, River Song and the TARDIS. Forest scenes in [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] were filmed at Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean over nine nights in July 2009.|$|E
