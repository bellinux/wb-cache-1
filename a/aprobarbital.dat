5000|$|<b>Aprobarbital</b> (as {{known in}} the United States, or aprobarbitone (as known elsewhere), sold as Oramon, Somnifaine, and Allonal, is a {{barbiturate}} derivative invented in the 1920s by Ernst Preiswerk. It has sedative, hypnotic and anticonvulsant properties, and was used primarily {{for the treatment of}} insomnia. [...] <b>Aprobarbital</b> was never as widely used as more common barbiturate derivatives such as phenobarbital and is now rarely prescribed as it has been replaced by newer drugs with a better safety margin.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{extraction}} and identification of urinary metabolites of allylic barbiturates by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry is described. The metabolites from rat and guinea pig urine were extracted and separated into two fractions (an acidic and a nonacidic fraction) by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex before being converted into suitable derivatives for gas phase analysis. N,N’-dimethyi derivatives were used except {{in cases where}} metabolic N-demethylation was possible, in which case N-ethylation yielded more information. Hydroxyl, keto, and epoxy groups were converted into trimethylsilyl (TMS), alkyloxime, and chloro-TMS derivatives, respectively. This procedure was used to identify metabolites present in urine at concentrations as low as 0. 1 pg/mI. The allyl sidechains of secobarbital, alphenal, allobarbital, and <b>aprobarbital</b> were metabolized to epoxides, diols, and, {{in the case of}} secobarbital, to a ketol. Other sidechains were usually hydroxylated. Secobarbital was metabolized to compounds containing hydroxyl groups in both chains. Hexobarbital was metabolized by allylic hydroxylation, and no evidence of the epoxide-diol the detection of epoxides of the four allyli...|$|E
40|$|Secobarbital is a {{hypnotic}} sedative {{that is used}} in {{the treatment}} of preoperative anxiety and to manage elevated intracranial pressures and cerebral ischemia due to neurosurgical procedures. Stereoselective resolution is first predicted using hydroxypropyl-γ-cyclodextrin (HPGCD) -(R) - and (S) -secobarbital transient complex energy calculations using SYBYL 6. 01 molecular modeling software. Separation is accomplished as predicted using 40 mM HPGCD in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 9. 0), resulting in a rapid, sensitive method for the determination of (S) - and (R) -enantiomers of secobarbital from serum using solid-phase extraction, capillary electrophoresis (CE), and ultraviolet detection. The method involves extraction of both enantiomers and the internal standard, <b>aprobarbital,</b> from serum using C 1 8 Bond-Elut solid-phase cartridges. The CE system consists of fused-silica capillary (52 cm χ 75 -µm i. d.) maintained at a run voltage of 15 kV with detection performed at a wavelength of 254 nm. The detection and quantitation limits from serum for (S) - and (R) -secobarbital are 1 µg/mL. Linear calibration curves from 1 to 60 µg of both (S) - and (R) -secobarbital show a coefficient of determination of more than 0. 999. The precision and accuracy of the method, calculated as relative standard deviation (%) and percent error, are 0. 35 - 4. 48 % and 0. 71 - 8. 67 %, respectively, for (©-secobarbital and 0. 39 - 4. 08 % and 2. 16 - 3. 70 %, respectively, for (5) -secobarbital...|$|E
