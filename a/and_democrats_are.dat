5000|$|Another {{usage of}} the term puts the words {{together}} in order to voice the not unheard-of opinion that the two mainstream American political parties are {{two sides of the}} same coin.

5000|$|His second book, co-authored with Joseph M. Parent, American Conspiracy Theories, was {{published}} by Oxford University Press in 2014. In this book, Uscinski and Parent study the waxing and waning of conspiracy theorizing over time in the United States. The main hypothesis of the book was that conspiracy theories are for losers. By that, they argue {{that those who are}} out of power tend to use conspiracy theories to consolidate resources, focus attention on an enemy, and aim at redemption. This manifests itself particularly after elections. The book has been widely reviewed [...] and discussed. Recent survey evidence taken before and after the 2016 election provides positive evidence for the conspiracy theories are for losers theory. More controversially, Uscinski argues that Republicans <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>are</b> equally taken to conspiracy theorizing, and that Americans may not be engaging in conspiracy theorizing more than in previous decades [...]|$|E

Further, the effects of educational attainment and self-reported understanding on global warming beliefs and concern are positive for liberals and Democrats, but are weaker or negative for conservatives and Republicans.

40|$|This month {{has seen}} an {{unfolding}} scandal over ‘secret’ Veterans Affairs lists for veterans {{waiting to see}} doctors, and now many Republicans <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>are</b> calling for the resignation of Secretary Eric Shinseki. Barbara Romzek writes that the scandal stems from the burdens placed on Veterans Affairs employees who gamed the waiting list system in order to please their own bosses. She argues that the scandal reflects the tangled web of accountability placed on Veterans Administration {{at the same time}} as it has experienced a massive increase in demand for healthcare from veterans. While firing Shinseki and others may give the perception of ‘doing something’, she writes, it will do little to solve the underlying problems...|$|E

40|$|Health care crisis Social Security and Medicare {{accounted}} for 36 % of federal spending in 2011, and as baby boomers age, those costs {{are projected to}} keep rising. As recently forecasted, the Social Security trust fund will be exhausted in 2033, three years sooner than projected last year. And Medicare’s hospital insurance trust fund will be depleted in 2024 [1]. One solution is to cut Medicare {{and other health care}} benefits, to narrow treatment options, to slow the growth in benefits somewhat for wealthier recipients. Another solution is to increase taxes (in whatever form) and/or to increase the federal budget deficit. These solutions are political. Here I will discuss a biomedical solution, which can be easily incorporated into their political program by both Democrats and Republicans. Then there will be no dilemma either to increase taxes or to decrease benefits. But first we will discuss what is the cause of the forthcoming crisis. Crisis as a side effect of improved health care As recently noted “Republicans <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>are</b> noisily blaming each other for the problems of the popular programs, which provide benefits to more than 55 million people. [1] ” Yet, the health care crisis is not the fault of either Republicans or Democrats. The crisis is a “side-effect ” of the ever-increasing effectiveness of medicine. That is, the crisis is indirectly due to the marvelous achievements of the modern medicine suc...|$|E
