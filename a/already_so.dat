The book's first print run sold out in Poland within hours. The book received substantial coverage in the media, provoked nationwide debate, and was noted by the international press.

5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are <b>already</b> <b>so</b> many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E

For this demonstration they employed a near-field Talbot Lau interferometer. In the same interferometer they also found interference fringes for C60F48., a fluorinated buckyball with a mass of about 1600 u, composed of 108 atoms. Large molecules are <b>already</b> <b>so</b> complex that they give experimental access to {{some aspects of the}} quantum-classical interface, i.e., to certain decoherence mechanisms. In 2011, the interference of molecules as heavy as 6910u could be demonstrated in a Kapitza–Dirac–Talbot–Lau interferometer. In 2013, the interference of molecules beyond 10,000u has been demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|During 1915, the {{new federal}} Seamen's Act had been passed because of the RMS Titanic {{disaster}} three years earlier. The law required retrofitting of {{a complete set of}} lifeboats on Eastland, as on many other passenger vessels. This additional weight may have made Eastland more dangerous as it potentially worsened the already severe problem of being top-heavy. Some argued that other Great Lakes ships would suffer from the same problem. Nonetheless, it was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson. Eastland was <b>already</b> <b>so</b> top-heavy that it had special restrictions concerning the number of passengers that could be carried. Prior to that, during June 1914, Eastland had again changed ownership, this time bought by the St. Joseph and Chicago Steamship Company, with Captain Harry Pedersen appointed the ship's master.|$|E

Gai Lan and Dai Yuan became worried because Sun He, who had no blood relations with Sun Yi, was <b>already</b> <b>so</b> upset over Sun Yi's death.

25|$|The {{condition}} of the Jewish community was unchanged under Mohammed III (1757–89), who distinguished himself by his attempt to introduce European culture into his kingdom. His eldest son, Moulay Ali, governor of Fez, courageously opposed his father's suggestion to impose a tax upon that city in favor of his other brothers, which tax was to be paid by the Jewish community. He stated that the Jews of Fez were <b>already</b> <b>so</b> poor that {{they were unable to}} bear the present tax and that he was not willing to increase still further their excessive misery. His minister was the Jew Elijah ha-Levi, who had at one time fallen into disgrace and had been given as a slave to a smuggler of Tunis, but had been restored to favor. The accession to the throne of Yazid, on the death of Mohammed III in 1789, led to a terrible massacre of the Moroccan Jews, having refused him their support in his fight with his brother for the succession. As a punishment the richer Jews of Tetouan, at his entry into the city, were tied to the tails of horses and dragged through the city. Many were killed in other ways or robbed. Jewish women were raped. The Spanish consul, Solomon Hazzan, was executed for alleged treachery, and the Jews of Tangier, Asilah, and Alcazarquivir were condemned to pay a large sum of money. Elijah, the minister of the former king, who had always opposed Yazid in the council, quickly embraced Islam to avoid being persecuted; but he died soon after. The cruelty of the persecutors reached its climax in Fez. In Rabat, as in Meknes, the Jews were ill-treated. In Mogador, strife arose between the Jews and the city judge on the one hand, and the Moorish citizens on the other; the dispute was over the question of Jewish garb. Finally the Jews were ordered to pay 100,000 piasters and three shiploads of gunpowder; and most of them were arrested and beaten daily until the payment was made. Many fled beforehand to Gibraltar or other places; some died as martyrs; and some accepted Islam. The notables and the Muslim masses then rose to intervene on behalf of the Jews. They hid many of them in their houses and saved a great many others. In Rabat, the governor Bargash saved the community from the worst. The sanguinary events of the year 1790 have been poetically described in two kinot for the Ninth of Ab, by Jacob ben Joseph al-Mali? and by David ben Aaron ibn Husain.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} not {{included}} in , marking the second time in the Bond series that the theme song was split from the soundtrack album, following [...] "You Know My Name" [...] from Casino Royale in 2006. Wilson and Broccoli still asked [...] composer Thomas Newman to include a reference to [...] "Skyfall" [...] in the film's score, [...] "so that it didn't appear as a kind of 'one off' {{at the top of the}} movie". Newman opted to include an interpolation in the track [...] "Komodo Dragon", used in a scene where Bond enters a casino in Macau. According to Newman the scene had [...] "a real moment of 'Bond' swagger", and the music fitted the scene accordingly. Epworth was visited by Newman for advice, and Redford, who was already doing the score's orchestration, was requested to arrange [...] "Komodo Dragon"; Newman was unable to do the arrangement because he felt that his task [...] "was <b>already</b> <b>so</b> huge and daunting".|$|E

When creating the background sequences, they used the band's slogan, Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock as an inspiration. They used old photos of the band members, pairing them up with pulsating, moving, otherworldly backgrounds, for example they filmed floating fluorescent paint in a fish tank with a GoPro camera. The scene where Toshi appears to be standing on top of a waterfall, was filmed in the couple's own kitchen sink with running tap water, while the camera emerging from the water to show the waterfall was actually filmed in Greece. Adobe After Effects and Smoke was used during the production.|$|E
500|$|Jake Muncy of Wired, though {{impressed}} with the game, noted {{that the lack of}} any narrative or gameplay guidance could cause [...] "players to bounce off [...] entirely". Further, on completing the game, Muncy believed that though Blow had compared his game to the novel Gravity's Rainbow, it failed to create a vivid living setting in the island in contrast to the novel as to make it an engaging work. Oli Welsh of Eurogamer praised the game's puzzles for providing numerous [...] "eureka" [...] moments to the player and considered the title as the video game analog of the Goldberg Variations, but felt that the narrative atop the puzzles was [...] "self-involved and wilfully obscure", and believed {{that it could have been}} omitted, as Blow and his team [...] "needn't have tried to make a puzzle out of art when he had <b>already,</b> <b>so</b> beautifully and so successfully, made art out of puzzles". Justin McElroy of Polygon gave the game an 8/10 rating, describing it as [...] "uplifting but frustrating"; he criticized the length of time involved in solving certain puzzles while expressing concern that less-patient players would take shortcuts.

500|$|While Leng {{considers}} that, lyrically and musically, [...] "Something" [...] reflects [...] "doubt and {{striving to}} attain an uncertain goal", author Ian Inglis writes of the confident statements that Harrison makes throughout regarding his feelings for Boyd.

[...] Similarly, when Harrison sings in the middle eight that [...] "You're asking me will my love grow / I don't know, I don't know", Inglis interprets the words as [...] "not an indication of uncertainty, but a wry reflection that his love is <b>already</b> <b>so</b> complete that it may simply be impossible for it to become any greater". Richie Unterberger of AllMusic describes [...] "Something" [...] as [...] "an unabashedly straightforward and sentimental love song" [...] written at a time [...] "when most of the Beatles' songs were dealing with non-romantic topics or presenting cryptic and allusive lyrics even when they were writing about love".|$|E
