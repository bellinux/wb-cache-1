50|$|The poem {{has become}} a staple of American humor, both <b>as</b> <b>an</b> iconic example of dirty poetry and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>joking</b> example of fine art, whose vulgarity and simple form provide a {{surprise}} contrast to an expected refinement.|$|R

5|$|The joke in {{the episode}} about Fox Mulder's {{predicted}} death being by autoerotic asphyxiation {{was inspired by}} previous jokes in the series about Mulder's interest in pornography.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, {{a decade before}} the tunnel was {{actually}} constructed, a rumor circulated that such a passageway already existed connecting the White House to the Treasury Building. According to one account, the rumor started <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> among journalists covering the White House, but gained serious traction, with some accounts even suggesting that Ogden L.

5|$|The {{concept for}} The Report was first {{seen in a}} series of Daily Show {{segments}} which advertised the then-fictional series <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> It was later developed by Stewart's Busboy Productions and pitched to Comedy Central, which green-lighted the program; Comedy Central had already been searching for a way to extend the successful Daily Show franchise beyond a half-hour.

5|$|The {{game has}} been {{compared}} by the developer as akin to skateboarding games, but where the player controls a goat aimed at doing as much damage as possible around an open world map, without any other larger goals. The game, initially developed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> prototype from an internal game jam and shown in an early alpha state in YouTube videos, was met with excitement and attention, prompting the studio to build out the game into a releasable state while still retaining various non-breaking bugs and glitches to maintain the game's entertainment value.|$|E
5|$|After {{moderate}} {{sales of}} their debut album Cheshire Cat (1995), released on independent record label Cargo Music, Blink-182 enjoyed {{a small amount}} of success. Throughout 1994 and 1995, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, mostly in Australia, where audiences embraced the band's irreverent sense of humor and stage shows. When the trio grew frustrated when fans lamented the inability to purchase Cheshire Cat at their respective local record stores, they began to turn toward other record labels to achieve wider distribution than Cargo. By the end of 1995, problems had become apparent between the trio and the label, who regarded the band <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> not to be taken seriously.|$|E
5|$|In early 1932, {{a letter}} Rhoads {{had written in}} November 1931, which disparaged Puerto Ricans and claimed he had killed and {{intentionally}} injected cancer cells into his patients, was given by a lab assistant to Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. He publicized the letter in the Puerto Rican and American media, {{which led to a}} scandal, an official investigation, and a US whitewashing campaign to protect Rhoads and, by extension, Rockefeller interests. In the ensuing investigation, Rhoads defended himself, saying he had written his comments in anger and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> to a New York colleague. Neither Puerto Rico's Attorney General nor the medical community found evidence of his or the project's giving any inappropriate medical treatment, and the scandal was forgotten.|$|E

5|$|Kyo's appears {{repeatedly}} in the series {{at the insistence of}} the marketers and the main planners. Iori, and other SNK regulars also appear in every game, making it a challenge to decide the storyline for each title. Along with his rival Iori, it has been noted by several of the series' designers that Kyo {{is one of the most}} difficult characters to illustrate because of his popularity among fans. Originally, Kyo's girlfriend, Yuki, was not meant to be conceptualized, since her first mention ever in the story was in Kyo's profile as one of his most cherished possessions. Her addition to his profile was done by one of the programmers mostly <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> since Kyo was more popular with female gamers.|$|E
5|$|Needham {{may have}} {{introduced}} Charteris to Sally Salisbury around 1708. Salisbury was the pre-eminent prostitute {{of the day}} and was kept by Charteris for a short time as mistress at the beginning of her career. When her previous bawd, Mother Wisebourne, died in 1719, she became a member of Needham's household and brought with her a clientele from the highest ranks of society. Salisbury brought further fame to Needham's house by involving another of her girls in the theft of the Earl of Cardigan's clothes. The two women accompanied him to Newmarket where he became drunk, and after putting him to bed at an inn they stole his clothes and jewellery and returned to London. The Earl treated the matter <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b>|$|E
5|$|On June 16, 2016, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Dr. Langer and Legion Group Arts, young Italian researcher Giovanni Rapazzini de Buzzaccarini discovered a long-lost early work by Brooks at the Vittoriale in Gardone. Brooks had copied (Pietro di Cristoforo Vannucci 1450-1523) Perugino's Portrait of a Young Man at the Uffizi when she was a penniless art student in Rome. She painted the man because she thought he resembled herself as a girl. She later gave the painting to D'Annunzio <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> when she refused to become his lover. D'Annunzio was in the tasteless habit—Romaine thought—of hanging pictures of his mistresses in a rogue's gallery. Buzzaccarini found this painting in the music room.|$|E

5|$|Though the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise, made no {{move against}} Knox, his {{activities}} caused concern among the church authorities. The bishops of Scotland viewed him {{as a threat to}} their authority and summoned him to appear in Edinburgh on 15 May 1556. He was accompanied to the trial by so many influential persons that the bishops decided to call the hearing off. Knox was now free to preach openly in Edinburgh. William Keith, the Earl Marischal, was impressed and urged Knox to write to the Queen Regent. Knox's unusually respectful letter urged her to support the Reformation and overthrow the church hierarchy. Queen Mary took the letter <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> and ignored it.|$|E
