40|$|ABSTRACT The {{notion of}} a {{translation}} map in <b>a</b> quantum <b>principal</b> bundle is introduced. A translation map is then used {{to prove that the}} cross sections of a quantum fibre bundle E(B, V, A) associated to <b>a</b> quantum <b>principal</b> bundle P(B, <b>A)</b> are in bijective correspondence with equivariant maps V → P, and that <b>a</b> quantum <b>principal</b> bundle is trivial if it admits a cross section which is an algebra map. The vertical automorphisms and gauge transformations of <b>a</b> quantum <b>principal</b> bundle are discussed. In particular it is shown that vertical automorphisms are in bijective correspondence with AdR-covariant maps A...|$|R
