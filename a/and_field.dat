5|$|After the Olympic and Paralympic Games, {{the most}} {{prominent}} events for track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> athletes include the three IOC-sanctioned continental games: the All-Africa Games, Asian Games, and the Pan American Games. Other games such as the Commonwealth Games and Summer Universiade, and World Masters Games have significant participation from track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> athletes. Track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> is also present at the national games level, with competitions such as the Chinese National Games serving as the most prestigious national competition for domestic track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> athletes.|$|E
5|$|That same year, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) was established, {{becoming}} the international governing body for track <b>and</b> <b>field,</b> and it enshrined amateurism {{as one of}} its founding principles for the sport. The National Collegiate Athletic Association held their first Men's Outdoor Track <b>and</b> <b>Field</b> Championship in 1921, {{making it one of the}} most prestigious competitions for students, and this was soon followed by the introduction of track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> at the inaugural World Student Games in 1923. The first continental track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> competition was the 1919 South American Championships, which was followed by the European Athletics Championships in 1934.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the modern Olympic Games {{at the end of}} the 19th century marked a new high for track <b>and</b> <b>field.</b> The Olympic athletics programme, comprising track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> events plus a marathon race, contained many of the foremost sporting competitions of the 1896 Summer Olympics. The Olympics also consolidated the use of metric measurements in international track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> events, both for race distances and for measuring jumps and throws. The Olympic athletics programme greatly expanded over the next decades, and track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> contests remained among the Games' most prominent. The Olympics was the elite competition for track <b>and</b> <b>field,</b> and only amateur sportsmen could compete. Track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> continued to be a largely amateur sport, as this rule was strictly enforced: Jim Thorpe was stripped of his track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> medals from the 1912 Olympics after it was revealed that he had played baseball professionally.|$|E

5|$|The {{international}} {{governance of}} track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> {{falls under the}} jurisdiction of athletics organisations. The International Association of Athletics Federations is the global governing body for track <b>and</b> <b>field,</b> and athletics as a whole. The governance of track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> at continental and national level is also done by athletics bodies. Some national federations are named after the sport, including USA Track & Field and the Philippine Amateur Track & Field Association, but these organisations govern more than just track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> and are in fact athletics governing bodies. These national federations regulate sub-national and local track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> clubs, as well as other types of running clubs.|$|E

5|$|Up {{until the}} early 1920s, track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> had been almost {{exclusively}} a male-only pursuit. A growing women's sports movement in Europe and North America led {{to the establishment of}} the Women's World Games in 1921 and this ultimately caused the introduction of five track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> events for women in the athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics. In China, women's track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> events were being held in the 1920s, but were subject to criticism and disrespect from audiences. In 1923, physical education advocate Zhang Ruizhen called for greater equality and participation of women in Chinese track <b>and</b> <b>field.</b> The rise of Kinue Hitomi and her 1928 Olympic medal for Japan signified the growth of women's track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> in East Asia. More women's events were gradually introduced as years progressed (although it was only {{towards the end of the}} century that the men's and women's programmes approached parity of events). Marking an increasingly inclusive approach to the sport, major track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> competitions for disabled athletes were first introduced at the 1960 Summer Paralympics.|$|E

5|$|Aidoo was a multi-sport athlete at St. Ignatius of Loyola High School, playing Canadian football, soccer, track <b>and</b> <b>field,</b> and basketball. With {{the track}} <b>and</b> <b>field</b> team, he was twice named most {{valuable}} player, participating in events including the 110 metres hurdles, shot put, and javelin. Aidoo {{played on the}} Loyola Hawks football team from 1995 to 1997, and he ruptured his spleen during a playoff game in 1996. Despite this, Aidoo increasingly focused on football, eventually leaving the track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> team in his final year. In 1997, he played for the Oakville-Burlington Invictas of the Great Lakes Football League, a junior football league. Aidoo {{played a major role}} on the Invictas, including rushing for 165 yards and two touchdowns on only 11 carries against the Essex Ravens. Returning to his high school football team in the fall, Aidoo helped the Hawks reach the Halton final in 1997. In both of his final two years at Loyola, he was selected as the High School Athlete of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Akins {{began playing}} high school {{football}} at Starkville High School as a freshman. Due to his small size, Akins rarely played. As a senior, he was ruled ineligible for academic reasons but continued practicing with the football team throughout the season. Akins was also able to participate on the track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> team, running sprints. After Akins impressed his {{high school football}} coach by practicing despite his ineligibility, the coach invited East Mississippi Community College to look at Akins. A representative of East Mississippi attended a track <b>and</b> <b>field</b> meet where Akins won the 100 metres and offered him a scholarship to play college football shortly afterward.|$|E
