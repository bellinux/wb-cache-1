5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore {{with a damp}} sponge to quench <b>any</b> <b>remaining</b> embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun {{with a bag of}} powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.|$|E
5|$|Each NFL {{franchise}} {{seeks to}} add new players through the annual NFL Draft. The draft rules were last updated in 2009. The {{team with the}} worst record the previous year picks first, the next-worst team second, and so on. Teams that {{did not make the}} playoffs are ordered by their regular-season record with <b>any</b> <b>remaining</b> ties broken by strength of schedule. Playoff participants are sequenced after non-playoff teams, based on their round of elimination (wild card, division, conference, and Super Bowl).|$|E

5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain {{infectious}} {{for the rest of}} their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. Treatments for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have been developed. In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills <b>any</b> <b>remaining</b> infected cells.|$|E
5|$|In 1660 Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne and ownership of the castles changed once again. Beaumaris {{was restored}} to {{the control of the}} Bulkeley family, traditionally the constables of the castle, who promptly stripped the castle of <b>any</b> <b>remaining</b> materials, including the roofs, and Conwy was returned to the Conway family, who stripped down the castle for lead and timber, reducing it to a ruin as well. Charles' new government regarded Caernarfon's castle and town walls as a security risk and ordered them to be destroyed, but this order was never carried out, possibly because of the costs involved in doing so.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to fuel and oxidizer systems, the launch vehicle's {{main propulsion system}} is also equipped with a helium system consisting of ten storage tanks in {{addition to}} various regulators, check valves, distribution lines, and control valves. The system is used in-flight to purge the engine and provides pressure for actuating engine valves within the propellant management system and during emergency shutdowns. During entry, on the Space Shuttle, <b>any</b> <b>remaining</b> helium was used to purge the engines during reentry and for repressurization.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Defence {{launched}} Project MoDEL (Ministry of Defence Estates London) in 2006 {{to consolidate}} {{many of its}} London-based operations at RAF Northolt. Under the project, RAF Bentley Priory, RAF Uxbridge, RAF West Ruislip, RAF Eastcote and the Inglis Barracks in Mill Hill were all closed between 2006 and 2010 with <b>any</b> <b>remaining</b> units transferring to Northolt. The Air Historical Branch, originally established in 1919 to provide a record of air activity during the First World War, was also relocated to RAF Northolt from RAF Bentley Priory in 2008 {{as part of this}} project. As a result, the station has been extensively redeveloped with new facilities to support these operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for Metro's fare collection system was awarded in 1975 to Cubic Transportation Systems. Electronic fare collection using paper magnetic stripe cards started on July 1, 1977, {{a little more}} than a year after the first stations opened. Prior to electronic fare collection, exact change fareboxes were used. Metro's historic paper farecard system is also shared by Bay Area Rapid Transit, which Cubic won a {{contract for}} in 1974. <b>Any</b> <b>remaining</b> value stored on the paper cards was printed on the card at each exit, and passes were printed with the expiration date.|$|E

5|$|When Wilson {{proposed}} {{establishment of}} a League of Nations, with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles, Taft expressed public support. He was {{out of step with}} his party, whose senators were not inclined to ratify the treaty. Taft's subsequent flip-flop on the issue of whether reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides, destroying <b>any</b> <b>remaining</b> influence he had with the Wilson administration, and causing some Republicans to call him a Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party. The Senate refused to ratify the Versailles pact.|$|E
5|$|According to {{government}} surveyor Thomas Corby, Newton's parakeet {{may still have}} been fairly common in 1843. Slater reported that he saw a single specimen in southwestern Rodrigues during his three-month stay to observe the 1874 Transit of Venus, and assistant colonial secretary William J. Caldwell saw several specimens in 1875 during his own three-month visit. The male that he received in 1875 and gave to Newton is the last recorded member of the species. A series of cyclones struck the following year and may have devastated the remaining population. Further severe storms hit in 1878 and 1886, and since few forested areas were left by this time, there was little cover to protect <b>any</b> <b>remaining</b> birds. The male could, therefore, {{have been the last}} of the species alive.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{radiotherapy}} {{is commonly}} used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; {{in the case of}} endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina. External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat <b>any</b> <b>remaining</b> cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved. VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.|$|E
25|$|More than 35 {{bird species}} have been {{recorded}} from Kiritimati. As noted above, only the bokikokiko (Acrocephalus aequinoctialis), perhaps a few Rimitara lorikeets (Vini kuhlii) – if <b>any</b> <b>remain</b> at all – and the occasional eastern reef egret (Egretta sacra) make up the entire landbird fauna. About 1,000 adult bokikokikos {{are to be found}} at any date, but mainly in mixed grass/shrubland away from the settlements.|$|R

5|$|At 00:25, Kondo {{ordered all}} of his ships that were able to {{converge}} and destroy <b>any</b> <b>remaining</b> U.S.ships. However, the Japanese ships still {{did not know where}} Washington was located, and the other surviving U.S.ships had already departed the battle area. Washington steered a northwesterly course toward the Russell Islands to draw the Japanese force away from Guadalcanal and the presumably damaged South Dakota. The Imperial ships finally sighted Washington and launched several torpedo attacks, but by the skilled seamanship of her captain she avoided all of them and also avoided running aground in shallow waters. At length, believing that the way was clear for the transport convoy to proceed to Guadalcanal (but apparently disregarding the threat of air attack in the morning), Kondo ordered his remaining ships to break contact and retire from the area about 01:04, which most of the Japanese warships complied with by 01:30.|$|E
5|$|Before diving, {{pinnipeds}} typically exhale {{to empty}} their lungs {{of half the}} air and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea. Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and alveoli that completely deflate during deeper dives. While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their lungs, pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after complete respiratory collapse. The middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate. The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, <b>any</b> <b>remaining</b> air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage uses any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, disruptive coloration, shadow elimination, self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and color. Animals such as the flat-tail horned lizard of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and {{blend in with the}} ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. Additionally, these lizards hide <b>any</b> <b>remaining</b> shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground.|$|E
