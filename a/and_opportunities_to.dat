He continued helping the Survey until 1989, also serving as an assistant researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara.|$|E
5|$|Returning to a {{previous}} setting offered the artists new challenges <b>and</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> {{expand the scope}} of the city. Having the player walk through the streets at night inspired a film noir ambiance. Color shifts and a high degree of contrast pushed the game's look beyond what previous Halo games had offered, but the team had to make sure that even dark portions of the city were playable. The entire core development team looked at commissioned concept paintings to decide how lighting schemes would affect the gameplay. The genre also influenced the character names and archetypes. The player character, for example, fits the concept of a lone, hardboiled detective. To increase the depth of the surroundings, Bungie added touches such as advertisements, trash collectors, and civilian versions of previously seen military hardware.|$|E
