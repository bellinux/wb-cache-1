50|$|For {{the next}} three years, the group {{struggled}} to compete against the changing musical landscape for which their girl group sound {{had fallen out of}} favor with popular audiences. In 1971, they moved to England, where they had a cult fan base, and on the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> Vicki Wickham, <b>changed</b> their name to Labelle and ditched the dresses and bouffant wigs for jeans and Afros. Releasing transitional albums including 1971's Labelle and 1972's Moon Shadow, the group recorded material that included sexual and political subject matter - unheard of for an all-female black group. The transition was hard for lead singer LaBelle, who was a fan of the group's early-era ballads, but she eventually gave in. Member Dash remained neutral throughout the tenure of the group. Shortly after releasing Labelle, the group became the opening act for The Who, whose producer Kit Lambert had produced the group's Warner debut.
