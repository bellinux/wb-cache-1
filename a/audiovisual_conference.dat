40|$|ICU {{telemedicine}} uses <b>audiovisual</b> <b>conferencing</b> {{technology to}} provide critical care from a remote location. Research {{is needed to}} best define the optimal use of ICU telemedicine, but efforts are hindered by methodological challenges {{and the lack of}} an organized delivery approach. We convened an interdisciplinary working group to develop a research agenda in ICU telemedicine, addressing both methodological and knowledge gaps in the field. To best inform clinical decision-making and health policy, future research should be organized around a conceptual framework that enables consistent descriptions of both the study setting and the telemedicine intervention. The framework should include standardized methods for assessing the preimplementation ICU environment and describing the telemedicine program. This framework will facilitate comparisons across studies and improve generalizability by permitting context-specific interpretation. Research based on this framework should consider the multidisciplinary nature of ICU care and describe the specific program goals. Key topic areas to be addressed include the effect of ICU telemedicine on the structure, process, and outcome of critical care delivery. Ideally, future research should attempt to address causation instead of simply associations and elucidate the mechanism of action in order to determine exactly how ICU telemedicine achieves its effects. ICU telemedicine has significant potential to improve critical care delivery, but high-quality research is needed to best inform its use. We propose an agenda to advance the science of ICU telemedicine and generate research with the greatest potential to improve patient care...|$|R
40|$|This article maps {{audiovisual}} translation {{research by}} analysing in a contrastive way the abstracts presented at three <b>audiovisual</b> translation <b>conferences</b> {{ten years ago}} and nowadays. The comparison deals with the audiovisual transfer modes and topics under discussion, and the approach taken by the authors in their abstracts. The article then shifts the focus {{to the role of}} technology in audiovisual translation research, as it is considered an element that is impacting and will continue to impact both research and practice in this field. Relevant research in audio-related, text-related and image-related technologies applied to audiovisual translation is summarised. The last section briefly discusses how technological tools can also help audiovisual translation professionals, users and researcher...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the first}} {{operational}} IPTV networks have been deployed, service providers and operators {{have struggled to}} make their subscribers happy and satisfied with their services. To keep them as customers in the long term, they {{have been looking for}} ways to identify impairments to the perceived quality of experience. It is now well understood that this can only be achieved if the service providers have virtual eyes throughout their networks. In this article we provide an overview of the Real-Time Transport Protocol and its application to IPTV. We describe the monitoring and reporting features offered by RTP, and emphasize how they can be used to enhance subscriber QoE. acket-based multimedia communication {{has come a long way}} since its early exploration in the 1970 s (for audio over Ethernet) and the 1980 s (for <b>audiovisual</b> <b>conferencing</b> over IP), and is nowadays a commodity for millions of users. The most prominent example for the success of IP-based multimedia is IP telephony, where commercial development started in the 1990 s, and which has led to the conversion — although operators usually prefer to talk of convergence — of many time-division multiplexing (TDM) based telecommunication networks into IP networks, from the core to the enterprise and increasingly to the home. With increasing availability of broadband access, the entertainment sector has also started to embrace the idea of running everything over IP, leading to the notion of triple play (Internet access, telephony, and IP television [IPTV]) offered in an integrated fashion by Internet service providers (ISPs). Non-ISP-based offerings have followed the trend with a multitude of web-based multimedia streaming offerings including Internet radio stations, TV broadcasters delivering selected programming, and user-generated content platforms such as YouTube. While the types of services, and the control protocols used to access and interact with them, may differ, the common theme across all services is the delivery of real-time (multi) media contents over a packet-switched network.

40|$|The "anytime, anywhere" {{concept of}} human-oriented {{ubiquitous}} computing and communication environment (UE) provides an avenue {{for people to}} access to everyday devices with some built-in intelligent feature. This allows for them to conveniently access to vast amounts of information including multimedia services in real time {{from the comfort of}} their homes e. g. payTV and interactive TV, streaming <b>audiovisuals,</b> video <b>conferencing</b> and video phones, interactive gaming and online merchandising. With this vast amount of multimedia content being distributed in the environment, {{there is a need to}} provide protection for the content from piracy and illegal duplication, which is an important security issue if the UE is to gain popularity and widespread usage. One method to provide content protection and tracing of illegal duplications is using buyer-seller watermarking protocols. In particular, owner-specific marks are embedded into the content to allow content protection and buyer-specific marks are embedded to trace illegal duplications. Two such protocols were independently proposed by Chang and Chung, and Cheung et al., at ICCT 2003 and HICSS 2004, respectively. We show that both the seller's and buyer's rights are not protected in both protocols and therefore the protocols fail to provide even the most basic security requirement of buyer-seller protocols. It is important that these protocols not be deployed for securing UE, but to undergo redesign and thorough security analysis before being reconsidered...|$|R
40|$|The {{emerging}} eye-tracking {{technique has}} opened a window of opportunities not only in medical research but also in Translation and Interpreting Studies. In recent years this research method {{has been used to}} trace the processes of reading, translation and interpreting. Eye-tracking has recently become a popular technique to examine cognitive effort involved in written translation, <b>audiovisual</b> translation and <b>conference</b> interpreting. Thanks to the use of an eye-tracker one is able to investigate the whole process and not limit oneself to analysing the quality of the output. To be more precise, by means of eye-tracking experimenters may investigate moment-by-moment changes in the cognitive effort necessary to perform a given translation/interpreting task. Useful as the eye-tracking technique may be, researchers must often face methodological and apparatus-related challenges. The present paper is intended to discuss the eye-tracking methodology and then to address the potential problems of applying this method to investigate the processes of translation and interpreting. Among the notions to be discussed are: the types of eye-trackers and their usability, accuracy vs. ecological validity, accommodation (O'Brien 2010), sampling, the use of inferential statistics for small experimental groups as well as ethics. I will also refer to my own research on the notion of language-pair specificity in sight translation (Korpal 2012) as well as a collaborative work on numerical data processing in simultaneous interpreting (Korpal and Stachowiak, manuscript in preparation) ...|$|R
