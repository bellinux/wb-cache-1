40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} some {{classes of}} graphs which are easily {{seen to have}} many perfect matchings. Such graphs can be considered robust {{with respect to the}} property of having <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> if under vertex deletions (with some mild restrictions), the resulting subgraph continues to have <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>matching.</b> It is clear that you can destroy the property of having <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> by deleting <b>an</b> odd number of vertices, by upsetting a bipartition or by deleting enough vertices to create an odd component. One class of graphs we consider is the m×m lattice graph (or grid graph) for m even. Matchings in such grid graphs correspond to coverings of an m×m checkerboard by dominoes. If in addition to the easy conditions above, we require that the deleted vertices be Θ(m) apart, the resulting graph has <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>matching.</b> The second class of graphs we consider is a k-fold product graph consisting of k copies of a given graph G with the ith copy joined to the i+ 1 st copy by <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> joining copies of the same vertex.

40|$|Abstract. For planar graphs, {{counting}} {{the number of}} perfect matchings (and hence determining whether there exists <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>matching)</b> can be done in NC [4, 10]. For planar bipartite graphs, finding <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> when one exists can also be done in NC [8, 7]. However in general planar graphs (when the bipartite condition is removed), no NC algorithm for constructing <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> is known. We address a relaxation of this problem. We consider the fractional matching polytope P(G) of a planar graph G. Each vertex of this polytope is either <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>matching,</b> or <b>a</b> half-integral solution: an assignment of weights from the set { 0, 1 / 2, 1 } to each edge of G so that the weights of edges incident on each vertex of G add up to 1 [6]. We show that a vertex of this polytope can be found in NC, provided G has at least one <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> to begin with. If, furthermore, the graph is bipartite, then all vertices are integral, and thus our procedure actually finds <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> without explicitly exploiting the bipartiteness of G. ...|$|R

According to Davis, he had heard Collins and Kalom arguing behind closed doors, before Kalom had run out of his (Collins') apartment, with Collins chasing after her. Collins had returned to their shared apartment shortly thereafter and asked Davis to hide a knife for him. Davis had reported this incident to police, and later handed them the knife Collins had allegedly asked him to hide. Investigators determined the knife was consistent with the weapon used to stab Kalom. When Kalom's body was found, a distinctive boot print on her skirt was found to be <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>match</b> to a boot Collins had owned, and although Collins had evidently cleaned his car in an effort to destroy evidence prior to his arrest, investigators would find bloodstains in this vehicle and upon a raincoat he owned which were determined to match Kalom's blood type.

25|$|To {{determine}} which epitopes are shared between pathogen and self, large protein databases are used. The largest protein database in the world, {{known as the}} UniProt database (formerly SwissProt), has shown reports of molecular mimicry becoming more common with expansion of the database. The database currently contains 1.5 X 107 residues. The probability of finding <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>match</b> with a motif of 5 amino acids in length is 1 in 3.7 X 10−7 (0.055). Therefore, within the SwissProt database, {{one would expect to}} find 1.5 X 107 X 3.7 X 10−7 = 5 matches. However, there are sequence motifs within the database that are overrepresented and are found more than 5 times. For example, the QKRAA sequence is an amino acid motif in the third hypervariable region of HLA-DRB1*0401. This motif is also expressed on numerous other proteins, such as on gp110 of the Epstein-Barr virus and in E. coli. This motif occurs 37 times in the database. This would suggest that the linear amino acid sequence may not be an underlying cause of molecular mimicry since it can be found numerous times within the database. The possibility exists, then, for variability within amino acid sequence, but similarity in three-dimensional structure between two peptides can be recognized by T cell clones. This, therefore, uncovers a flaw of such large databases. They may be able to give a hint to relationships between epitopes, but the important three-dimensional structure cannot yet be searched for in such a database.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the well-studied problem of finding <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> in d-regular bipartite graphs with 2 n vertices and m = nd edges. While the best-known algorithm for general bipartite graphs (due to Hopcroft and Karp) takes O(m √(n)) time, in regular bipartite graphs, <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> {{is known to}} be computable in O(m) time. Very recently, the O(m) bound was improved to O({m, n^ 2. 5 n/d}) expected time, an expression that is bounded by Õ(n^ 1. 75). In this paper, we further improve this result by giving an O({m, n^ 2 ^ 3 n/d}) expected time algorithm for finding <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> in regular bipartite graphs; as a function of n alone, the algorithm takes expected time O((n n) ^ 1. 5). To obtain this result, we design and analyze a two-stage sampling scheme that reduces the problem of finding <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> in <b>a</b> regular bipartite graph to the same problem on a subsampled bipartite graph with O(n n) edges that has <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> with high probability. The matching is then recovered using the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm. While the standard analysis of Hopcroft-Karp gives us an Õ(n^ 1. 5) running time, we present a tighter analysis for our special case that results in the stronger Õ({m, n^ 2 /d}) time mentioned earlier.
