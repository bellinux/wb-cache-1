In a 1990 interview, Van Winkle said the two melodies were slightly different because he had added an <b>additional</b> <b>note,</b> an anacrusis ("pickup") between odd-numbered and subsequent even-numbered iterations of the Under Pressure sample. In later interviews, Van Winkle readily admitted he sampled the song and claimed his 1990 statement was a joke; others, however, suggested he had been serious. Van Winkle later paid Queen and Bowie and as a result, Bowie and all members of Queen have since been given songwriting credit for the sample. In December 1990, Van Winkle told British youth music magazine Smash Hits where {{he came up with}} the idea of sampling [...] "Under Pressure": ...|$|E

They joked about their time in Mexico and the incompetence of General Pillow [...] Grant offered to loan Buckner money to see him through his impending imprisonment, but Buckner declined. As an <b>additional</b> <b>note</b> Buckner paid for then Captain Grant's lodging in New York City after the Mexican War when Grant was destitute. Also Buckner acted as a pall bearer and paid for Grant's funeral and provided Grant's widow a financial monthly payment so she could live out her years. The surrender was a humiliation for Buckner personally, but also a strategic defeat for the Confederacy, which lost more than 12,000men and much equipment, as well as control of the Cumberland River, {{which led to the}} evacuation of Nashville.|$|E

2500|$|This {{battle is}} of <b>additional</b> <b>note</b> {{because it was}} the first {{recorded}} use of ship-mounted gunpowder weapons being used in combat. [...] The Venetians, who were already using powder siege weapons on land, mounted small bombards to many of their galleys during the fight to keep the Genoese force cordoned off in Chioggia. [...] Although there is little known about these weapons, it is known that they were not used for ship-to-ship combat. [...] The weapons were far too inaccurate to be used against other ships, and instead were used to bombard enemy walls and fortifications. [...] The Genoese commander, Pietro Doria, was killed by a collapsing fortification that was hit by a ball fired from a Venetian galley.|$|E

[...] Bible readings were permitted where authorised by local regulation, including the option of using the Douay version for Roman Catholic students, but without any <b>additional</b> <b>note</b> or comment by the teacher. [...] By another section of the Parish Schools Act, contentious books relating to theology were not permitted in the school libraries.|$|E
2500|$|A variant {{sequence}} with an <b>additional</b> <b>note,</b> G-E'-C'-G, {{known as}} [...] "the fourth chime", was used during significant events of extreme urgency (including during World War II, {{especially in the}} wake of the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor; on D-Day and during disasters). The NBC chimes were mechanized in 1932 by Rangertone founder Richard H. Ranger; their purpose was to send a low-level signal of constant amplitude that would be heard by the various switching stations manned by NBC and AT engineers, and to be used as a system cue for switching individual stations between the Red and Blue network feeds. Contrary to popular legend, the G-E'-C' notes were not originally intended to reference to the General Electric Company (an early shareholder in NBC's founding parent RCA and whose Schenectady, New York radio station, WGY, was an early affiliate of NBC Red). The three-note sequence remains in use by the NBC television network, most notably incorporated into the John Williams-composed theme music used by NBC News, [...] "The Mission" [...] (first composed in 1985 for NBC Nightly News).|$|E

60|$|For these reasons,--though, as respects either art, policy, or morality, as {{distinct}} from religion, I not only still hold, but would even wish strongly to re-affirm the substance of what I said in my earliest books,--I shall reprint scarcely anything in this series {{out of the first}} and second volumes of 'Modern Painters'; and shall omit much of the 'Seven Lamps' and 'Stones of Venice'; but all my books written within the last fifteen years will be republished without change, as new editions of them are called for, with here and there perhaps an <b>additional</b> <b>note,</b> and having their text divided, for convenient reference, into paragraphs, consecutive through each volume. I shall also throw together the shorter fragments that bear on each other, and fill in with such unprinted lectures or studies as seem to me worth preserving, so as to keep the volumes, on an average, composed of about a hundred leaves each.|$|E

The incidence of their being uncannily beautiful and alluring should serve as an <b>additional</b> <b>note</b> of warning. The girl had had a row with her mother and wanted to get away. It was this infernal moonlight that was chiefly responsible. No wonder dogs bayed at it. He almost fancied he could hear one now. Nice, respectable, wholesome-minded things, dogs. No damned sentiment about them. What if he had kissed her! One is not bound for life to every woman one kisses. Not {{the first time she had}} been kissed, unless all the young men in Brittany were blind or white blooded. All this pretended innocence and simplicity! It was just put on. If not, she must be a lunatic. The proper thing to do was to say good-bye with a laugh and a jest, start up his machine and be off to England--dear old practical, merry England, where he could get breakfast and a bath.|$|E
60|$|She had {{returned}} from the morning's affair in the park with a conscience not altogether easy. To have stood by whilst her father had struck Caron, and moreover, to have done so without any sense of horror, or even of regret, was a matter in which she asked herself whether she had done well. Certainly La Boulaye had presumed unpardonably in speaking to her as he had spoken, and for his presumption it was fitting {{that he should be}} punished. Had she interfered she must have seemed to sympathise, and thus the lesson might have suffered in salutariness. And yet Caron La Boulaye was a man of most excellent exterior, and, when passion had roused him out of his restraint and awkwardness, of most ardent and eloquent address. The very sombreness that--be it from his mournful garments or from a mind of thoughtful habit--seemed to envelop him was but an <b>additional</b> <b>note</b> of poetry in a personality which struck her now as eminently poetical. In the seclusion of her own chamber, as she recalled the burning words and the fall of her father's whip upon the young man's pale face, she even permitted herself to sigh. Had he but been of her own station, he had been such a man as she would have taken pride in being wooed by. As it was--she halted there and laughed disdainfully, yet with never so faint a note of regret. It was absurd! She was Mademoiselle de Bellecour, and he her father's secretary; educated, if you will--aye, and beyond his station--but a vassal withal, and very humbly born. Yes, it was absurd, she told herself again: the eagle may not mate with the sparrow.|$|E

6000|$|In {{taking the}} field as a dramatist, Byron sought to win {{distinction}} for himself--in the first place by historical accuracy, and, secondly, by artistic regularity--by a stricter attention to the dramatic [...] "unities." [...] "History is closely followed," [...] he tells Murray, in a letter dated July 17, 1820; and, again, in the Preface (vide post, pp. 332-337), which is {{an expansion of the}} letter, he gives a list of the authorities which he had consulted, and claims to have [...] "transferred into our language an historical fact worthy of commemoration." [...] More than once in his letters to Murray he reverts to this profession of accuracy, and encloses some <b>additional</b> <b>note,</b> in which he points out and rectifies an occasional deviation from the historical record. In this respect, at any rate, he could contend on more than equal terms [...] "with established writers," [...] that is, with Shakespeare and Otway, and could present to his countrymen an exacter and, so, more lifelike picture of the Venetian Republic. It is plain, too, that he was bitten with the love of study for its own sake, with a premature passion for erudition, and that he sought and found relief from physical and intellectual excitement in the intricacies of research. If his history is at fault, it was not from any lack of diligence on his part, but because the materials at his disposal or within his cognizance were inaccurate and misleading. He makes no mention of the huge collection of Venetian archives which had recently been deposited in the Convent of the Frari, or of Doria's transcript of Sanudo's Diaries, bequeathed in 1816 to the Library of St. Mark; but he quotes as his authorities the Vitæ Ducum Venetorum, of Marin Sanudo (1466-1535), the Storia, etc., of Andrea Navagero (1483-1529), and the Principj di Storia, etc., of Vettor Sandi, which belongs to {{the latter half of the}} eighteenth century. Byron's chroniclers were ancient, but not ancient enough; and, though they [...] "handed down the story" [...] (see Medwin, Conversations, p. 173), they depart in numerous particulars from the facts recorded in contemporary documents. Unquestionably the legend, as it appears in Sanudo's perplexing and uncritical narrative (see, for the translation of an original version of the Italian, Appendix, pp. 462-467), is more dramatic than the [...] "low beginnings" [...] of the myth, which may be traced to the annalists of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; but, like other legends, it is insusceptible of proof. Byron's Doge is almost, if not quite, as unhistorical as his Bonivard or his Mazeppa. (See Nuovo Archivio Veneto, 1893, vol. v. pt. i. pp. 95-197; 1897, vol. xiii. pt. i. pp. 5-107; pt. ii. pp. 277-374; Les Archives de Venise, par Armand Baschet, 1870; Storia della Repubblica di Venizia, Giuseppe Cappelletti, 1849, iv. pp. 262-317.) ...|$|E
