5|$|After flowering, {{the curved}} {{leathery}} to woody follicles develop. Hanging downwards on wooden stalks, these <b>are</b> <b>roughly</b> oblong in shape, and measure around 5cm (2in) long. They split longitudinally {{to release the}} winged seeds, which are ripe around March. There are around 16seeds, which are arranged in two rows. Wooden structures known as lamellae separate the seeds {{from each other and}} the follicle walls.|$|E
5|$|Ascospores are {{ellipsoidal}} in shape, hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, with {{dimensions of}} 17–22 by 7–9µm. They are also biguttulate, containing two large oil droplets at either end. The spore-producing cells, the asci, <b>are</b> <b>roughly</b> cylindrical, eight-spored, operculate (opening by an apical lid to discharge the spores) and have dimensions of 200–350 by 12–17|µm. The {{diameter of the}} club-shaped paraphyses is 7–10µm at the apex.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} appear brown. Viewing {{them with a}} light {{microscope}} reveals finer details of their structure: they <b>are</b> <b>roughly</b> spherical but end abruptly in a small point, their surfaces are covered with small, wart-like nodules, and their size is between 5.0–5.3 by 4.0–4.7µm. The spores are in amyloid, meaning they do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent.|$|E
5000|$|In practice, this {{ratio is}} almost always {{extremely}} small. For example, the Schwarzschild radius rs of the Earth <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> 9 mm ( [...] inch); at {{the surface of the}} Earth, the corrections to Newtonian gravity are only one part in a billion. The Schwarzschild radius of the Sun <b>is</b> much larger, <b>roughly</b> 2953 meters, but at its surface, the ratio rs/r <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> 4 parts in a million. A white dwarf star is much denser, but even here the ratio at its surface <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> 250 parts in a million. The ratio only becomes large close to ultra-dense objects such as neutron stars (where the ratio <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> 50%) and black holes.|$|R
50|$|As n grows, Xn gets smaller.

5|$|Root form implants; {{the most}} common type of implant {{indicated}} for all uses. Within the root form type of implant, there <b>are</b> <b>roughly</b> 18 variants, all made of titanium but with different shapes and surface textures. There is limited evidence showing that implants with relatively smooth surfaces are less prone to peri-implantitis than implants with rougher surfaces and no evidence showing that any particular type of dental implant has superior long-term success.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the modern}} (English, American and Imperial) troy ounces <b>are</b> <b>roughly</b> 1.5% {{heavier than the}} late Paris ounce, the exact {{historical}} relations between the original marc de Troyes, the French poids de marc, the Flemish trooisch pond and the English troy pound are unclear.

The spores are round, smooth, translucent (hyaline), and have diameters of about 12–14µm. They are filled with many small oil droplets. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphae in the hymenium) are enlarged at their tips and filled with brown colored matter, about 4µm thick.|$|E

5|$|The {{metabolism}} of bupropion {{is highly}} variable: the effective doses of bupropion received by persons who ingest {{the same amount}} of the drug may differ by as much as 5.5times (with a half-life of 12–30hours), while the effective doses of hydroxybupropion may differ by as much as 7.5times (with a half-life of 15–25hours). Based on this, some researchers have advocated monitoring of the blood level of bupropion and hydroxybupropion. The half-lives of erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion <b>are</b> <b>roughly</b> 23–43hours and 24–50hours respectively.|$|E
