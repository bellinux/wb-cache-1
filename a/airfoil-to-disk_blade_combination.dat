Gameplay is divided into two different styles: aerial-based rail shooter segments, and ground-based segments that feature both linear paths and free-roaming areas. The game's difficulty, or Intensity, is determined by betting hearts in the Fiend's Cauldron before beginning each mission. The difficulty ranges from the very easy [...] "0.0" [...] to the highly difficult [...] "9.0". Pit's combat abilities are divided between long-range attacks using gun-like weapons, and close-quarters melee attacks. During missions, defeating enemies grants the player hearts, the game's currency. Hearts are used to increase the game's difficulty by laying bets against the player's own performance. As the game progresses, Pit gains access to weapons separated into nine types: bows, bracer-like claws, <b>blades</b> (a <b>combination</b> of a sword and a gun), clubs, orbitars (twin orbs hovering near Pit), staffs, arms (a weapon that fits around his wrist), palms (magical tattoos covering Pit's arm), and cannons. Each weapon has unique advantages and disadvantages. Once equipped, weapons can be tried out in the game's Practice Range. Using the 3DS' StreetPass network, players can share weapons with other players in the form of Weapon Gems. Other players can pay hearts to convert the gem into a weapon. Hearts can be spent upgrading weapons or fusing Weapon Gems, along with being gained by dismantling unwanted weapons or converting Weapon Gems.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The newly {{developed}} tomographical dual wavelength photometry enables {{the measurement of}} the local intensity of segregation at a multitude of points inside the stirred vessel. This is done by injecting a mixture of an inert and a reacting dye into the vessel. The inert dye serves as a tracer for the macromixing, whereas the vanishing of the reacting dye shows the micromixing. The concentration fields of the dyes are measured simultaneously by transluminating the vessel from three directions with superimposed laser beams of different wavelength. The light absorption by the dyes is measured with CCD-cameras and these projections are used for the tomographic reconstruction of the concentration fields. Low Reynolds number measurements were performed {{with a combination of}} two Rushton turbines and a combination of two Pitched <b>Blade</b> Impellers. The <b>combination</b> of the Pitched Blade Impellers yields a good axial transport but a slow micromixing.

HIP temperatures above the γ′ solvus temperature allow the fastest and most effective reduction of the porosity, because only the soft γ phase is present. The recent and novel possibility of cooling the samples from the maximum HIP temperature with a fast cooling of about 200 [*]K/min, results in a fine and homogeneous distribution of γ′ particles, which requires no additional solution annealing treatment to dissolve the developed γ′ particles during the extremely short cooling time.
