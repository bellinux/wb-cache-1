5|$|Before the {{publication}} of Industrial Society <b>and</b> <b>Its</b> <b>Future,</b> Ted Kaczynski's brother, David Kaczynski, was encouraged by his wife Linda {{to follow up on}} suspicions that Ted was the Unabomber. David was at first dismissive, but began to take the likelihood more seriously after reading the manifesto a week after it was published in September 1995. He browsed through old family papers and found letters dating back to the 1970s written by Ted and sent to newspapers protesting the abuses of technology and which contained phrasing similar to that found in Industrial Society <b>and</b> <b>Its</b> <b>Future.</b>|$|E

5|$|FBI agents arrested Kaczynski on April 3, 1996, at his cabin, {{where he}} was found in an unkempt state.

They also found {{what appeared to be}} the original typed manuscript of Industrial Society <b>and</b> <b>Its</b> <b>Future.</b> By this point, the Unabomber had been the target of the most expensive investigation in FBI history.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{that the}} price relationship between a stock index <b>and</b> <b>its</b> associated nearby <b>futures</b> markets {{can be explained by}} the cost-of-carry model using the concordance correlation (CC) coefficient in the US financial markets. The main purpose of this research is to confirm that the CC coefficient is an appropriate methodology to determine ex post arbitrage opportunities and to maximize ex ante arbitrage profits through the analysis of the price relationship derived from the cost-of-carry model. To increase the robustness of the results and to enable us to generalize our conclusions, this analysis is carried out in consideration of external uncertainty, including the marking-to-market procedure of futures contracts and the transaction cost on the stock index <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>futures</b> markets, under several assumptions related to the conditions of transactions. Examining transaction price data on the S&P 500 stock index <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>futures</b> markets shows that the CC coefficient gives a good result for ex ante arbitrage profits and is appropriate for analyzing the relationship between the observed stock index <b>futures</b> market price <b>and</b> <b>its</b> theoretical price derived from the cost-of-carry model.

25|$|Economist William L. Silber {{wrote that}} the wisdom and {{historical}} impact of this action cannot be overemphasized. McAdoo's bold stroke, Silber writes, as a first consequence averted an immediate panic and collapse of the American financial and stock markets. But also, it {{laid the groundwork for}} a historic and decisive shift in the global balance of economic power, from Europe to the United States; a shift which occurred exactly at that time.

25|$|Unomásuno (English: One Plus One) is a Mexican tabloid {{newspaper}} {{with daily}} circulation in Mexico City. It {{was formed in}} 1977 by deserters from Mexico City's daily newspaper Excélsior, {{and became one of}} the leading leftist newspapers in Mexico during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The newspaper covered investigative topics that were frequently avoided {{by the rest of the}} Mexican press of the time, and was a harsh critic of the Mexican government. By the mid-1980s, disagreements over the newspaper's management style led to internal divisions. Those who disagreed with Unomásuno <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>future</b> initiatives left and formed La Jornada, another leftist daily in Mexico City, in 1984.|$|E
25|$|Coal {{can also}} be {{converted}} into synthetic fuels equivalent to gasoline or diesel by several different direct processes (which do not intrinsically require gasification or indirect conversion). In the direct liquefaction processes, the coal is either hydrogenated or carbonized. Hydrogenation processes are the Bergius process, the SRC-I and SRC-II (Solvent Refined Coal) processes, the NUS Corporation hydrogenation process and several other single-stage and two-stage processes. In the process of low-temperature carbonization, coal is coked at temperatures between 360 and 750°C (680 and 1,380°F). These temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar. The coal tar is then further processed into fuels. An overview of coal liquefaction <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>future</b> potential is available.|$|E

25|$|In November 1887, Louis took Céline and Thérèse on a diocesan {{pilgrimage to}} Rome for the priestly jubilee of Pope LeoXIII. The {{cost of the}} trip {{enforced}} a strict selection, {{a quarter of the}} pilgrims belonged to the nobility. The birth, in 1871, of the French Third Republic had marked a decline of the conservative right's power. Forced onto the defensive, the royalist bourgeoisie perceived a strong Church as an important means of safeguarding France's integrity <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>future.</b> The rise of a militant nationalist Catholicism, a trend that would, in 1894, result in the anti-Semitic scapegoating and trumped-up treason conviction of Alfred Dreyfus was a development that Thérèse did not at all perceive. Still a sheltered child, Thérèse lived in ignorance of political events and motivations.|$|E
25|$|To {{illustrate}} {{significance of}} genetic diversity loss, assume the average metapopulation size is 35 animals based on 140 animals spread across four populations (140/4=35). Assuming stable populations, these populations will lose 8% of their genetic diversity every decade. By managing all four populations as one, through strategic transfers, gene loss is reduced from 8% to 2% per decade, without {{any increase in}} bongo numbers in Kenya. By managing the European and African populations as one – by strategic exports from Europe combined with in situ transfers, gene loss is reduced to 0.72% every 100 years, with both populations remaining stable. If populations in Kenya are allowed to grow through the implementation of effective conservation, including strategic transfers, gene loss can be effectively halted in this species <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>future</b> secured in the wild.|$|E
