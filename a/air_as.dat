5|$|Protactinium in {{the body}} tends to {{accumulate}} in the kidneys and bones. The maximum safe dose of protactinium {{in the human body}} is 0.03 µCi that corresponds to 0.5 micrograms of 231Pa. This isotope, which might be present in the <b>air</b> <b>as</b> aerosol, is 2.5 times more toxic than hydrocyanic acid.|$|E
5|$|TB-3 and {{a single}} I-Z under the {{fuselage}} which attached and detached in the <b>air</b> <b>as</b> {{there was not enough}} ground clearance for the fighter. On 23 March 1935, TB-3 piloted by Stefanovskiy and I-Z with Stepanchenok at the controls performed the world's first mid-air docking between two fixed wing aircraft.|$|E

5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the contaminated spray was thrown back into the <b>air</b> <b>as</b> the base surge. Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E
5|$|A solar balloon {{is a black}} balloon that {{is filled}} with {{ordinary}} <b>air.</b> <b>As</b> sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is heated and expands causing an upward buoyancy force, much like an artificially heated hot air balloon. Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.|$|E
5|$|Also injured was Virginia Tech wide {{receiver}} Ricky Scales. Scales didn't play for 10 weeks {{during the regular}} season because of surgery to an injured tendon. Despite playing in only four games during the season, he finished the regular season as the Hokies' No. 5 receiver, catching 13 passes for 298 yards. Scales' injury caused the Hokies to be ranked among the worst in the Big East in receiving yardage, averaging less than 180 yards per game through the <b>air.</b> <b>As</b> the game moved closer, however, Scales recovered from his injury and appeared near full strength.|$|E

Skylark, Rapaport, and Sook-yin form a plan to break Kim's cult of personality by causing him to cry on <b>air.</b> <b>As</b> they arm themselves for the event, Rapaport and Sook-yin have sex. Before the broadcast starts, Kim presents Skylark with a puppy to keep.|$|E
5|$|Historically, in-water {{recompression}} was {{the usual}} method of treating decompression sickness in remote areas. Procedures were often informal and based on operator experience, and used <b>air</b> <b>as</b> the breathing gas as it {{was all that was}} available. The divers generally used standard diving gear, which was relatively safe for this procedure, as the diver was at low risk of drowning if he lost consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Krake {{operates}} {{with three}} floorless steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has three cars that can seat six riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 18 riders per train. The seats are black and each have a brown over-the-shoulder restraint. On each train, there are a pair of tubes that allow the water to be shot into the <b>air</b> <b>as</b> the train reaches the bottom of the first drop. Also, the trains for the roller coaster were manufactured in Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|Over {{two-thirds of}} Kansas' offense {{came through the}} <b>air</b> <b>as</b> the Jayhawks racked up 249net passing yards. The Hokies, meanwhile, earned almost half their offense on the ground. The end result of the varying {{offensive}} strategies was much the same, however. Kansas successfully converted six of its 17third-down attempts, while Virginia Tech converted seven of its 17attempts. The time of possession was one key stat in favor of Kansas, as Kansas controlled the ball for 33:47, over 7 minutes more than Virginia Tech's possession time of 26:13.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium–uranium, {{with about}} 15–30mol.% plutonium, {{can be used}} as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors. Its {{pyrophoric}} nature and high susceptibility to corrosion to the point of self-igniting or disintegrating after exposure to air require alloying with other components. Addition of aluminium, carbon or copper does not improve disintegration rates markedly, zirconium and iron alloys have better corrosion resistance but they disintegrate in several months in <b>air</b> <b>as</b> well. Addition of titanium and/or zirconium significantly increases the melting point of the alloy.|$|E

5|$|Rebirth and {{realms of}} {{existence}} are foundational teachings of Mahavira. According to the Acaranga Sutra, Mahavira comprehended life {{to exist in}} myriad forms, such as animals, plants, insects, water bodies, fire bodies, wind bodies, elemental forms, and others. He taught that a monk should avoid touching or disturbing {{any one of them}} including plants, never swim in water, nor light a fire or extinguish it, nor thrash their arms in the <b>air</b> <b>as</b> such actions can torment or hurt other beings that live in those states of matter.|$|E
5|$|State quarterback Erik Kramer was the {{cornerstone}} {{of one of those}} high-powered offenses, passing for 2,092yards and 14touchdowns en route to All-ACC honors and being named the ACC's player of the year. He set school records for passing yards in a season and total yards in a season despite being hampered by an injured ankle suffered in the Wolfpack's game against South Carolina. He was ably assisted in the passing game by All-ACC receiver Nasrallah Worthen, who led the team in receptions after catching 41 passes for 686 yards. State's offense was mostly accumulated through the <b>air,</b> <b>as</b> the Wolfpack averaged less than 160 yards per game on the ground.|$|E
5|$|That night, {{after the}} {{military}} evacuates Yellowstone, Jackson watches Charlie's video of Charles Hapgood's theory that polar shifts, Earth crust displacement and the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar predict a 2012 phenomenon. According to Charlie, anyone {{who attempted to}} inform the public was killed, including Jackson's NASA contact. After Jackson and his children return home, he delivers Yuri's sons Alec and Oleg to Santa Monica Airport. Realizing that Charlie was right, Jackson rents a plane and rescues his family as the Earth-crust displacement begins, causing a 10.9 magnitude earthquake, and they escape from LA by <b>air</b> <b>as</b> the city is destroyed and sinks into the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
