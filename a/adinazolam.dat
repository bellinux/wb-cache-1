50|$|<b>Adinazolam</b> (marketed {{under the}} brand name Deracyn) is a {{benzodiazepine}} derivative, and more specifically, a triazolobenzodiazepine (TBZD). It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and antidepressant properties. <b>Adinazolam</b> was developed by Dr. Jackson B. Hester, who was seeking to enhance the antidepressant properties of alprazolam, which he also developed. <b>Adinazolam</b> was never FDA approved and never {{made available to the}} public market, however it has been sold as a designer drug.|$|E
5000|$|A human study {{comparing}} the subjective effects and abuse potential of <b>adinazolam</b> (30 mg and 50 mg) with diazepam, lorazepam and a placebo showed that <b>adinazolam</b> causes the most [...] "mental and physical sedation" [...] {{and the greatest}} [...] "mental unpleasantness".|$|E
50|$|<b>Adinazolam</b> binds to peripheral-type {{benzodiazepine}} receptors that interact allosterically with GABA receptors as an agonist {{to produce}} inhibitory effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Adinazolam</b> was {{reported}} to have active metabolites in the August 1984 issue of The Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology. The main metabolite is N-desmethyladinazolam. NDMAD has an approximately 25-fold high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors as compared to its precursor, accounting for the benzodiazepine-like effects after oral administration. Multiple N-dealkylations lead to the removal dimethyl-aminoethyl side chain, leading to the difference in its potency. The other two metabolites are alpha-hydroxyalprazolam and estazolam. In the August 1986 issue of that same journal, Sethy, Francis and Day reported that proadifen inhibited the formation of N-desmethyladinazolam.|$|E
50|$|GABA ergic {{hypothesis}} {{for depression}} has been proposed. This hypothesis places the GABA {{system in a}} central role in the pathophysiology of depression and in addition to that clinical studies have shown that alprazolam and <b>adinazolam</b> have antidepressant activities in patients with major depressive disorder. Unfortunately we do not know which receptor subtype is responsible for the antidepressant activities. Studies in y2 knockout mice have shown that they display increased anxiety and depressive-like symptoms in despair based tests. The mice also had increased corticosterone concentration which is a symptom in major depression in humans. The y2 subunit is associated with α1-α6 subunits, which are all known α subunits, so these studies do not show which of the α subunits are related to the depressive like symptoms. Other studies with α2 knockout mice have displayed increased anxiety and depression-like symptoms in conflict based feeding tests and the fact that anxiety and depression are often linked seems to indicate that the α2 subunit might be a valid target for a GABAA antidepressant.|$|E
40|$|<b>Adinazolam</b> {{is a new}} triazolobenzodiazepine bearing an alkyl-amino side chain. A {{cross-over}} double-blind placebo controlled {{study was}} carried out in 12 healthy volunteers, in order to check the possible interaction between cimetidine and <b>adinazolam</b> after repeated co-administration. Cimetidine or placebo were given during 17 days. Beginning on Day 8 of each treatment, <b>adinazolam</b> was given in the increasing doses following sequence of doses for 3 days: 10 mg b. i. d., 20 mg b. i. d. and 20 mg t. i. d. A pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study was performed on the third day at each dose. A wash-out of three weeks was included between the two treatments. Cimetidine increased significantly the AUC values of both <b>adinazolam</b> and N-desmethyladinazolam, reduced the oral clearance of <b>adinazolam,</b> and prolonged adinazolam's half-life. The digit symbol substitution test was significantly affected at each dose level while the manual dexterity was marginally impaired by <b>adinazolam</b> plus cimetidine. Saftee-up interview and Clyde mood scale indicated an increased sedation under <b>adinazolam</b> plus cimetidine in four subjects...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to possessing anti-anxiety activity in man, triazolobenzodiazepines {{have been reported}} to have antidepressant and antipanic properties. In this they differ from classical 1, 4 -benzodiazepines that have only anti-anxiety activity. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine the effects of the triazolobenzodiazepines in two animal tests of anxiety and in the holeboard, to see whether clear differences could be observed between them and the 1, 4 -benzodiazepines. After acute administration, U- 43, 465 (16 mg kg- 1) had a significant anxiolytic effect in the social interaction test. Neither <b>adinazolam</b> (1 - 3. 5 mg kg- 1) nor alprazolam (0. 125 - 2 mg kg- 1) had a significant effect. It is suggested that this is because, with <b>adinazolam</b> and alprazolam, doses at which anxiolytic effects can be observed are close to those at which sedative effects can be observed. U- 43, 465 (8 - 16 mg kg- 1) and alprazolam (1 - 2 mg kg- 1) had significant anxiolytic effects in the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety. U- 43, 465 (8 - 32 mg kg- 1), <b>adinazolam</b> (0. 5 - 5 mg kg- 1) and alprazolam (0. 2 - 2. 0 mg kg- 1) caused dose-related reductions in exploratory head-dipping, locomotor activity and rearing in the holeboard. In general the results seen in the three tests with the triazolobenzodiazepines alprazolam and <b>adinazolam</b> were similar to those seen with classical 1, 4 -benzodiazepines. With U- 43, 465, however, an anxiolytic effect was observed in the social interaction test after acute treatment; chronic treatment is required to see an effect with classical 1, 4 -benzodiazepines. In this U- 43, 465 resembles the effects of several novel non-benzodiazepine putative anxiolytic compounds that are believed to have less sedative potential than the benzodiazepines...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} the value of mechanistic simulations in gaining insight into the behaviors of modified release (MR) formulations in vivo and to use the properly calibrated models for prediction of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). GastroPlusTM (Simulations Plus, Inc.) was used to fit mechanistic models for <b>adinazolam</b> and metoprolol that describe the absorption, PK, and PD after intravenous (i. v.) and immediate release (IR) oral (p. o.) administration. The fitted model for <b>adinazolam</b> was then used to predict the PD profile for a MR formulation and to design a new formulation with desired onset and duration of action. The fitted metoprolol model was used to gain insight and to explain the in vivo behaviors of MR formulations. For each drug, a single absorption/PK model was fitted that provided simulated plasma concentration–time profiles closely matching observed in vivo profiles across several different i. v. and p. o doses. Sedation score profiles of <b>adinazolam</b> were fitted with an indirect PD model. For metoprolol, the fitted absorption/PK model for IR p. o. doses was used to select in vitro dissolution conditions that best matched the in vivo release of MR doses. This model also explained differences in exposure after administration of MR formulations with different release rates. Mechanistic absorption/PK models allow for detailed descriptions of all processes affecting the two drugs’ bioavailability, including release/dissolution, absorption, and intestinal and hepatic first pass extraction. The insights gained can be used to design formulations that more effectively overcome identified problems...|$|E
40|$|Changes to 5 -HT$ sb 2 $ receptors in rat brain {{following}} antidepressant and anxiolytic treatment were investigated. The B$ sb{ rm max}$ of ($ sp{ 125 }$I) AMIK {{was found}} to be decreased significantly in rat fronto-parietal cortex after 21 days administration of antidepressant drugs including desmethylimipramine (30 %), buspirone (47 %) and <b>adinazolam</b> (17 %). The anxiolytic drug, diazepam, which is devoid of intrinsic antidepressant action, did not significantly change the binding parameters. In comparison to 5 -HT$ sb 2 $ receptors, the beta-adrenoceptors labelled by ($ sp{ 125 }$I) cyanopindolol in membrane binding were decreased only by desmethylimipramine, with a 17 % reduction in B$ sb{ rm max}$. Data from in-vitro quantitative autoradiography suggests that ($ sp{ 125 }$I) AMIK binding to 5 -HT$ sb 2 $ receptors is decreased in frontal and parietal cortices following 21 days administration of DMI, amitryptiline, gepirone and <b>adinazolam.</b> The results from the present study strongly suggest that the 5 -HT$ sb 2 $ receptor is involved in depressive disorders. Since some of the antidepressant drugs tested possess anxiolytic activity after prolonged administration, 5 -HT$ sb 2 $ receptors may also be important in anxiety disorders...|$|E
40|$|Most {{antidepressant}} therapies {{require an}} initial period of sustained use before therapeutic effects are observed; the {{literature suggests that}} {{this may be due to}} alterations in either serotonergic or noradrenergic systems. To further explore the mechanism of action of antidepressants, the effect of 21 -day drug treatment to rats on serotonin type 2 and beta-adrenergic receptors in fronto-parietal hemicortices was evaluated. Because the same brain was used to measure concomitant changes in both receptors, confounding effects due to inter-animal variability are reduced. The effect of a classical antidepressant drug, desmethylimipramine, was compared with two compounds which have more recently been used to treat depression, ie., <b>adinazolam,</b> a tirazolobenzodiazepine, and buspirone, a serotonin type 1 A partial agonist, both of which possesses combined anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. The anxiolytic drug diazepam, a benzodiazepine devoid of antidepressant properties, was used as an active control treatment. Membrane binding studies showed that the maximal binding of [125 I]cyanopindolol to beta-adrenoceptors was significantly decreased only by desmethylimipramine treatment. On the other hand, <b>adinazolam</b> and buspirone, as well as desmethylimipramine, decreased the maximal binding of [125 I] 7 -amino- 8 -iodo-ketanserin binding to serotonin type 2 receptors. Diazepam was without effect on either receptor. These results suggest that down-regulation of serotonin type 2 receptors may be a common element in the mechanism of action of antidepressant therapies...|$|E
40|$|Two {{groups of}} rats {{were trained to}} {{discriminate}} either a low (1 mg/kg) or a high (1 0 mg/kg) intrapentoneal dose of diazepam from vehicle injections in a two-lever, food-reinforcement proce-dure. Comparison of the dose-response curves demonstrated {{a difference in the}} intensity of the stimulus effects. A number of benzodiazepine agonists and partial agonists were tested for stimulus generalization. The stimulus effect in both groups of rats generalized fully to tnazolam, alprazolam, <b>adinazolam</b> and pentobarbital. Ro 1 7 - 1 81 2 occasioned nearly full generalization in both groups of rats with a shallow dose-response slope. The low-, but not the high-dose stimulus effect generalized to th...|$|E
