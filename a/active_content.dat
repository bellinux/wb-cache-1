40|$|The {{antioxidant}} and antiglycation {{activities of}} various plant and ear parts of three maize (Zea mays L.) varieties (Golden, Sultan and Agatti 85) were studied. The {{results provided evidence}} that one ear and plant part of maize were effective in inhibiting the glycation activity. Whereas all maize ear and plant parts showed the presence of antioxidants. The silks of â€œGoldenâ€� had highest activities of protease and Ã¡-amylase and highest levels of total sugars and non-reducing sugars. Husk of variety â€œGoldenâ€� was rich in reducing sugars whereas its grains were rich in total soluble proteins. Total phenolic contents were highest in silk of variety â€œSultanâ€�, peroxidase in its husk and catalase in grains. The highest level of superoxidase dismutase and malondialdehyde was recorded in silks of variety â€œAgatti 85 â€�. Maximum inhibition of glycation endproducts formation was shown by the husk of â€œAgatti 85 â€� (ears part). Among plant parts, leaves of â€œSultanâ€� showed maximum antioxidant activity, superoxidase dismutase, protease, peroxidase activities and highest level of non-reducing sugars. Highest Ã¡-amylase, total sugars and reducing sugars were observed in leaves of â€œGoldenâ€�. The leaves of the variety â€œAgatti 85 â€� were rich in catalase activity and malondialdehyde contents. Total soluble protein in stem and the total phenolic contents {{were found to be}} high in the flowers of the variety â€œSultanâ€�. It can be concluded that there are some <b>active</b> <b>contents</b> present in the various ear and plant parts which were responsible for the high antiglycation and antioxidant activity.
