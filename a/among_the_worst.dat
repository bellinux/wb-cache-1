5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the Limousin region was characterised by the mediocrity of its animals. Texier-Olivier Louis, prefect of the Haute-Vienne, observed that Limousin cattle weighed 300 to 350kg and measured 1.5 metres at the withers. The defect was considered to be attributable to poor genetics, nutrition and breeding practices. In competitions, Limousin cattle were <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> performers. The breed was considered to be a working breed, but poorly shaped and with poor milk.|$|E

He maintained his spot as the most disciplined in his class, earning fewer than half the demerits than the second-best.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the best}} selling Atari 2600 game of all time; it sold an {{estimated}} 7million copies, and was the best-selling home video game of all {{time when it was}} released. However, critics have considered it <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> video games of all-time, criticizing its controls and visuals.

50|$|Critical {{response}} was overwhelmingly negative. It currently holds a 7% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 57 reviews (four positive, 53 negative), leading to its inclusion on {{several of the}} websites lists ranking <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> films, earning <b>the</b> distinction of being <b>the</b> single <b>worst</b> film of 1999, as well as ranking <b>among</b> <b>the</b> top-ten <b>worst</b> films of <b>the</b> 1990s.|$|R
5|$|Also injured was Virginia Tech wide {{receiver}} Ricky Scales. Scales didn't play for 10 weeks {{during the regular}} season because of surgery to an injured tendon. Despite playing in only four games during the season, he finished the regular season as the Hokies' No. 5 receiver, catching 13 passes for 298 yards. Scales' injury caused the Hokies to be ranked <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> in the Big East in receiving yardage, averaging less than 180 yards per game through the air. As the game moved closer, however, Scales recovered from his injury and appeared near full strength.|$|E

Starting left guard Nick Marshman was not expected to play after becoming academically ineligible following the fall semester, and was replaced by redshirt freshman Jaymes Brooks.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} praise in pre-release showings, Sonic the Hedgehog {{was released}} to notably negative reception. Criticism {{was directed at}} the game's perceived lack of polish, with reviewers citing long loading times, a poor camera system, gameplay glitches, a complicated plot, and imprecise control. It has been considered <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> games {{not only in the}} Sonic series but also in the video game medium.

5|$|Franklin Pierce (November 23, 1804October 8, 1869) was the 14th President of the United States (1853–57). Pierce was a {{northern}} Democrat {{who saw the}} abolitionist movement as a fundamental threat to {{the unity of the}} nation. His polarizing actions in championing and signing the Kansas–Nebraska Act and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act alienated anti-slavery groups while failing to stem conflict between North and South setting the stage for Southern secession and the American Civil War. Historians and other scholars generally rank Pierce <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of U.S. Presidents.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} theatrically in the United States and Canada in September 1982 {{and then quickly}} withdrawn because of its poor performance at the box office. It has never been released on home video, although it has sometimes been broadcast on television. It was the largest financial loss in film of 1982, earning less than $2 million. Reviewers at the time gave it consistently bad reviews and later commentators including Newsweek, TV Guide and Canadian Press have classed Inchon <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> films of all time.|$|E
5|$|Warren Gamaliel Harding (November 2, 1865 – August 2, 1923) was the 29th President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1921, {{until his}} death in 1923. At the time of his death, {{he was one of the}} most popular presidents, but the {{subsequent}} exposure of scandals that took place under his administration, such as Teapot Dome, eroded his popular regard, as did revelations of an affair by Nan Britton, one of his mistresses. In historical rankings of the U.S. presidents, Harding is often rated <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The film {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from film critics. The film holds a 33% [...] "rotten" [...] rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2011, Total Film ranked it as 27th <b>among</b> <b>the</b> 50 <b>worst</b> children's movies ever made.|$|R
50|$|The Canadiens {{did not win}} a Stanley Cup during Cude's {{tenure as}} their {{starting}} goaltender.

5|$|After {{the release}} of Batman Forever, Warner Bros. started {{development}} on Batman & Robin, commissioning it on fast track for an adamant June 1997 release. Val Kilmer did not return, because of scheduling conflicts with The Saint, {{and was replaced by}} George Clooney. Arnold Schwarzenegger starred as Mr. Freeze, while Uma Thurman starred as Poison Ivy and Alicia Silverstone starred as Batgirl. Chris O'Donnell reprised his role as Robin. Principal photography began in September 1996 and finished in January 1997, two weeks ahead of the shooting schedule. Batman & Robin was released on June 20, 1997, and received primarily negative reviews. Observers criticized the film for its toyetic and campy approach, and for homosexual innuendos added by Schumacher. Still, the film was a financial success, but remains to be the least commercially successful live-action Batman film ever. Batman & Robin received numerous nominations at the Razzie Awards and ranks <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> rated superhero films of all time.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carol was <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> {{tropical}} cyclones {{on record}} {{to affect the}} states of Connecticut and Rhode Island in the United States. It developed from a tropical wave near the Bahamas on August 25, 1954, and slowly strengthened as it moved northwestward. On August 27, Carol intensified to reach winds of 105mph (165km/h), but weakened as its motion turned to a northwest drift. A strong trough of low pressure turned the hurricane northeastward, and Carol later intensified into a major hurricane. While paralleling the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States, the storm produced strong winds and rough seas that caused minor coastal flooding and slight damage to houses in North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Delaware, and New Jersey. The well-organized hurricane accelerated north-northeastward and made landfall on eastern Long Island, New York, and then over eastern Connecticut on August31 with sustained winds estimated at 110-mph and a barometric pressure near 956 mb. Carol transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New Hampshire later on August 31, 1954.|$|E
5|$|On January 26, 2016, Bevin {{delivered}} a budget {{address to the}} General Assembly detailing his two-year budget proposal. The proposal cut the allocation for most state agencies by 9 percent over the upcoming biennium, {{with most of the}} savings being redirected into the state pension system, which was <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> funded in the nation. Public elementary and secondary education were spared from the cuts, as were social workers, public defenders, corrections officers, and Kentucky State Police employees, all of whom received raises under Bevin's proposal. Public colleges and universities were not exempt from the cuts, and Bevin called for a gradual move to performance-based funding for higher education, with all higher education funding tied to performance by 2020.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Elarton {{spent his}} first season entirely in the Majors since 2001. He {{recorded}} his first double digit winning season since 2000.

50|$|The {{strike is}} remembered bitterly by Yankees fans as it shook sports fans in New York City and the Yankees {{to the core}} and made 1994 one of <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> years in New York City sports history, and has been named <b>among</b> <b>the</b> 10 <b>worst</b> moments in New York City sports history, {{primarily}} because Mattingly had not played in a postseason. It was also seen as the frustrating peak of the Yankees' demise and downfall of the 1980s and early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Buchanan, {{despite his}} very short stature (compared by a later review to Tich Freeman) played as a round-arm fast bowler, for Rugby and Cambridge University, {{where he was}} at Clare College, but his results were {{considered}} unsatisfactory and his quickly-acquired reputation <b>among</b> <b>the</b> historically <b>worst</b> “rabbits” with <b>the</b> bat caused him to be dropped before the 1851 University match.|$|R
5|$|The {{light rail}} {{is now under}} {{construction}} from Lagunen via Kokstad to Bergen Airport, Flesland. Both Sørås and Indre Steinsvik have experienced rapid housing construction without a corresponding increase of public transport. Further out is a large corporate center with many of Bergen's largest employers, such as Telenor, Statoil and BKK. The area was built without sufficient roads or public transport, and has <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> road congestion in the urban area. Building the light rail line to Flesland will supplement the airport shuttles and offer cheaper service for locals and employees at the airport. Another incentive to build to Flesland {{was that there was}} sufficient available land which allows a large depot to be constructed. After the line was opened to Lagunen, there was insufficient space at Kronstad to house additional trams. The line to the airport is scheduled to open in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} failure in Test matches but success {{elsewhere}} continued during the 1934–35 {{tour of the}} West Indies. In all first-class cricket he scored 789 runs, averaging 56.35, with an innings of 281 not out the highest of his three centuries. The four-Test series, which England lost 2–1, was another matter. Wisden noted that the West Indian pace attack, considered {{the best in the}} world by Bob Wyatt, unsettled the English batsmen; the home bowlers were accused of intimidation by some of the England side. Hammond had a top score of 47 and scored 175 runs at an average of 25.00. He played well in difficult batting conditions, which he believed were <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> he ever faced, in the first Test. In the first innings he scored 43, before dominating the bowlers at a critical time in his unbeaten 29 in the second innings, winning the match with a six.|$|E
5|$|The rampant Cangrejal River {{reportedly}} obliterated {{an entire}} suburban community further east, near La Ceiba, while the Aguán River burst its banks at Trujillo and killed numerous plantation workers. By October 29, {{the bodies of}} 70 flood victims had been recovered at Corocito in Colón. Torrential rains extended into Tegucigalpa, causing urban flooding. Just to the northeast, in San Juancito, a large landslide took the lives {{of at least three}} people. Overall, the hurricane inflicted about $12 million in damage across Honduras (including the agricultural impacts), resulted in about 150 deaths, and destroyed the homes of thousands of residents. The floods were considered to be <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> in the country's history. Almost immediately after the passage of the storm, a wide area of Honduras experienced strong earthquake activity.|$|E
50|$|Coptic Christians face {{discrimination}} {{at multiple}} {{levels of the}} government, ranging from a disproportional representation in government ministries to laws that limit their ability to build or repair churches.

50|$|All three {{films have}} gained notoriety {{as a result}} of their {{appearances}} on Mystery Science Theater 3000, and have been often criticized for their abysmal production values, repetitive plot devices, murky picture quality, and stilted acting.
