5|$|<b>A</b> <b>weary</b> emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>weary</b> Emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, an {{increasingly}} discontented ruling class who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs: all these factors presaged the monarchy's impending doom. The means to achieve the overthrow of the Imperial system would soon appear within the Army ranks. Republicanism had never flourished in Brazil outside of certain elitist circles, and had little support in the provinces. A growing combination of republican and Positivist ideals among the army's junior and mid-level officer ranks, however, began to form a serious threat to the monarchy. These officers favored a republican dictatorship, which they believed would be superior to the liberal democratic monarchy. Beginning with small acts of insubordination {{at the beginning of the}} 1880s, discontent in the army grew in scope and audacity during the decade, as the Emperor was uninterested and the politicians proved incapable of re-establishing the government's authority over the military.|$|E

5|$|The Restoration, {{along with}} {{a return to the}} pre-war Laudian church and the passing of the Act of Uniformity in 1662, posed few {{problems}} for the sympathetic and quickly reformed Brasenose; only one fellow left without agreeing. For some, nominal allegiance to the new regime was the order of the day, supported by <b>a</b> <b>weary</b> college. The Restoration period was one of disciplinary laxity across the university; Brasenose was no different, with some of its students taking part in riots. Yate was instituted as successor – and somewhat retrospectively as predecessor – to Greenwood; six of the thirteen fellows that had been expelled returned; other personnel in the college were replaced. The period saw a rejuvenation of teaching in the University as a whole and a new cache of new thinkers, including Brasenose's Petty.|$|E
25|$|The bitter trainband {{controversy}} {{dragged on}} for several years, culminating in stiff fines. Eventually <b>a</b> <b>weary</b> Eames, who was in his mid-fifties when the controversy began and who had served Hingham as first militia captain, a selectman, and Deputy in the General Court, threw in the towel and moved to nearby Marshfield where he again served as Deputy and emerged as a leading citizen, despite his brush with the Hingham powers-that-be.|$|E

Two touchdowns {{early in the}} fourth put the Panthers up 31–17. Garcia {{attempted}} to mount a comeback, and led the Buccaneers on an 82-yard touchdown drive. After a blocked extra point, and a failed onside kick, Carolina took over with 2:28 remaining. Facing 3rd down & 4, DeAngelo Williams stymied the Buccaneers with a breakaway 36-yard touchdown run.|$|E

25|$|The Muslim army reached Tabuk after <b>a</b> <b>weary</b> march. At Tabuk the {{standard}} of the army was entrusted to Abu Bakr. There were no Byzantine forces to meet the Muslims. On coming to know of the advance of the Muslim army the Byzantines had withdrawn their army well within Syria. The Muslim achieved their object without fighting a shot. The Byzantines who had at one time threatened to invade Arabia were {{no longer in the}} mood to measure swords with the Muslims.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>weary</b> {{march through}} the Welsh hills brought the Royal army on 22 September to the {{neighbourhood}} of Chester. Charles himself with one body entered the city, which was partially invested by the Parliamentarian colonel Michael Jones, {{and the rest}} under Sir Marmaduke Langdale was sent to take Jones's lines in reverse. But at the opportune moment Poyntz's forces, which had followed the King's movements since he left Doncaster {{in the middle of}} August, appeared in rear of Langdale, and defeated him in the battle of Rowton Heath (24 September), {{while at the same time}} a sortie of the King's troops from Chester was repulsed by Jones. Thereupon the Royal army withdrew to Denbigh, and Chester, the only important seaport remaining to connect Charles with Ireland, was again besieged.|$|E
25|$|The {{passengers}} {{were put into}} the seven ship's boats:The steamer had struck nearly in the centre; her fore part was sunk very deep, and we watched her with the greatest anxiety {{to see if the}} water gained on her, fearing for the safety of those still on board, and also dreading that if she sank our boats would all be swamped. We rowed backwards and forwards between the rocks and the steamer all night, and <b>a</b> <b>weary</b> time it was. Guns were fired, and rockets sent up; but our signals of distress were not answered, though a light we saw at some distance on the shore made us hopeful that assistance was at hand. The masts were cut down to lighten the ship, and the crash as they fell into the water sounded very fearful.|$|E

Loki seizes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing Heimdall, gatekeeper of the Bifröst—the means of traveling between worlds—to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the Destroyer, a seemingly indestructible automaton, to pursue them and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor's sacrifice proves him worthy to wield Mjolnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Kissing Jane goodbye and vowing to return, {{he and his fellow}} Asgardians leave to confront Loki.|$|E
500|$|Having {{awarded the}} album {{a score of}} nine out of ten, the {{reviewer}} for NME said, [...] "At no point does [...] rock. It glides with a beautiful, uninhibited momentum." [...] The reviewer described McCulloch's voice as an [...] "instrument honed by years of life, love and all the shitty bits in between to a ravishing state of molten cashmere" [...] and the album as [...] "flawless" [...] for every [...] "second of its defiantly brief 38-and-a-half minutes". M. Tye Comer for CMJ said, [...] " [...] revisit the melancholia they've tussled with for nearly 20 years with a mature soul and a romantic urgency, having grown up without growing old." [...] Awarding the album {{four out of five}} stars, Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing for Allmusic said the album [...] "feels of a piece with their earlier albums, not only sonically, but in terms of quality." [...] Mark Richard-San for Pitchfork Media said, [...] "The over-the-top, bass-driven rockers of yore have been replaced with an album of introspective, acoustic songs appropriate for these aging geezers." [...] Richard-San also described McCulloch as having a [...] "rich, resonant voice", adding [...] "the quality of his singing is perfect – <b>a</b> <b>weary</b> voice transmitting from some abandoned studio of yesteryear." ...|$|E
500|$|Anne {{was unable}} to walk between January and July 1713. At Christmas, she was feverish, and lay {{unconscious}} for hours, which led to rumours of her impending death. She recovered, but was seriously ill again in March. By July, Anne had lost confidence in Harley; his secretary recorded that Anne told the cabinet [...] "that he neglected all business; that he was seldom to be understood; that when he did explain himself, she could not depend upon {{the truth of what}} he said; that he never came to her at the time she appointed; that he often came drunk; [...] last, to crown all, he behaved himself towards her with ill manner, indecency and disrespect." [...] On 27 July 1714, during Parliament's summer recess, she dismissed Harley as Lord Treasurer. Despite failing health, which her doctors blamed on the emotional strain of matters of state, she attended two late-night cabinet meetings that failed to determine Harley's successor. A third meeting was cancelled when she became too ill to attend. She was rendered unable to speak by a stroke on 30 July 1714, the anniversary of Gloucester's death, and on the advice of the Privy Council handed the treasurer's staff of office to Whig grandee Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury. She died around 7:30a.m. on 1 August 1714. John Arbuthnot, one of her doctors, thought her death was a release from a life of ill-health and tragedy; he wrote to Jonathan Swift, [...] "I believe sleep was never more welcome to <b>a</b> <b>weary</b> traveller than death was to her." ...|$|E

500|$|Patrick Kolan of IGN Australia awarded it {{a perfect}} 10/10 and said, [...] "It's the Watchmen film you {{always wanted to}} see, but never {{expected}} to get." [...] Also praising the film along with another perfect score (4/4) was Kyle Smith of the New York Post, comparing it to some of Stanley Kubrick's films: [...] "Director Zack Snyder's cerebral, scintillating follow-up to 300 seems, to even <b>a</b> <b>weary</b> filmgoer's eye, as fresh and magnificent in sound and vision as [...]" [...] Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars and wrote, [...] "It's a compelling visceral film—sound, images and characters combined into a decidedly odd visual experience that evokes {{the feel of a}} graphic novel." [...] Richard Corliss of Time concluded [...] "this ambitious picture is a thing of bits and pieces," [...] yet [...] "the bits are glorious, the pieces magnificent." [...] Total Film awarded it 4/5 stars, stating: [...] "It's hard to imagine anyone watching the Watchmen as faithfully as Zack Snyder's heartfelt, stylised adap. Uncompromising, uncommercial, and unique." [...] When comparing the film to the original source material, Ian Nathan of Empire felt that while [...] "it isn't the graphic novel... Zack Snyder clearly gives a toss, creating a smart, stylish, decent adaptation." [...] Nick Dent of Time Out Sydney gave the film 4/6 in his review of February 25, praising the film's inventiveness but concluding, [...] "While Watchmen is still as rich, daring, and intelligent an action film as there's ever been, it also proves Moore absolutely right [...] As a comic book, Watchmen is an extraordinary thing. As a movie, it's just another movie, awash with sound and fury." ...|$|E
