5|$|Contemporary {{scholars}} {{have found in}} the pamphlet evidence of several Early Modern British trends: the equation of effeminacy with homosexuality; the use of Sappho as <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> lesbianism {{at a time when}} public awareness of lesbian relationships was increasing; and an equation of Roman Catholic Italy and France with moral degeneracy.|$|E

5|$|Mayawati's {{political}} career has attracted praise and controversy. She has been praised for her fundraising efforts {{on behalf of}} her party, and her birthdays were major media events as well as <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> her supporters.

5|$|A {{red cross}} was <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> many Crusaders in the 12th and 13th centuries.

5|$|In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean {{language}} computing (CJK), some of {{the commonly}} used units, prefix–unit combinations, or unit–exponent combinations have been allocated predefined single characters taking up a full square. Unicode includes these in its CJK Compatibility and letter-like symbols sub-ranges for back compatibility, without necessarily recommending future usage. These are summarised in Unicode symbols. The cursive ℓ, a letter-like symbol, {{has been used in}} a number of countries in addition to China and Japan as <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> the litre, but this is not currently recommended by any standards body.|$|E
5|$|In his {{documentary}} The Pervert's Guide to Cinema, Slavoj Žižek {{remarks that}} Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the {{three levels of}} the human mind that are postulated by Freudian psychoanalysis: the top floor would be the superego, where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ego, where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' id. Žižek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.|$|E
5|$|To {{tell the}} truth, I wasn't all that {{fond of the}} damned thing by then, but it had become <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> {{the men of the}} 8th Wing. I knew McConnell understood.

The widely used logo represents a double image of a head and shoulders as the flower of a growing and vibrant plant. The reduced size of the inner head and shoulders image symbolizes the diminution in a person caused by Huntington's disease. The leaves represent the protection, purpose, growth {{and development of the}} Huntington's community worldwide in its search for a cure and treatment.|$|E
5|$|In his old age, {{he became}} <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> the Buffalo Soldiers. In 1994, {{he met with}} President Bill Clinton at the White House. In 1997, {{at the age of}} 103, Matthews was present at Arlington National Cemetery for a service honoring the Buffalo Soldiers, where he {{unveiled}} a plaque that dedicated his former barracks in honor of the soldiers. For his 108th birthday in 2002, he met with then-United States Secretary of State Colin Powell, where Powell was presented with a portrait of Matthews. He was a member of his local church, a Prince Hall Masonic Temple and the Washington chapter of the 9th and 10th Cavalry Association until his death.|$|E
5|$|Jefferson Davis {{served in}} many roles. As a soldier, he was brave and resourceful. As a politician, {{he served as}} a United States senator and a Mississippi congressman and was active and accomplished, {{although}} he never completed a full term in any elected position. As a plantation owner, he employed slave labor as did most of his peers in the South, and supported slavery. As president of the Confederate States of America, he is widely viewed as an ineffective wartime leader; although the task of defending the Confederacy against the much stronger Union would have been a great challenge for any leader, Davis's performance in this role is considered poor. After the war, he contributed to reconciliation of the South with the North, but remained <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> Southern pride.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of {{creation}} the hammer and sickle stood for worker-peasant alliance, with the hammer <b>a</b> traditional <b>symbol</b> of the industrial proletariat (who dominated the proletariat of Russia), and the sickle <b>a</b> traditional <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> the peasantry, but the meaning has since broadened to <b>a</b> globally recognizable <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> Marxism, Marxist parties, or socialist states.|$|R

5|$|Roman myth {{has it that}} Venus, {{the goddess}} of love, {{was born in the}} sea and emerged {{accompanied}} by fish and dolphins, with Botticelli depicting her as arriving in a scallop shell. The Romans revered her and erected shrines in her honour in their gardens, praying to her to provide water and verdant growth. From this, the scallop and other bivalve shells came to be used as <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> fertility. Its depiction is used in architecture, furniture and fabric design and it is the logo of Royal Dutch Shell, the global oil and gas company.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{feminism}} {{originated in}} the 18thcentury, influenced by the Western European Enlightenment and the prominent role of women as <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> democracy and freedom in the French Revolution. Notable Russian intellectual figures like Alexander Pushkin and Alexander Herzen wrote positively about the increased power and independence of women in their society and supported the growing concern for gender equality. In his influential novel What is to be Done?, the writer Nikolai Chernyshevski embodied the new feminist ideas in the novel's heroine, Vera Pavlovna, who dreams of a future utopian society with perfect equality among the sexes.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} Jordanian dish is mansaf, the national dish of Jordan. The dish is <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> Jordanian hospitality and {{is influenced by}} the Bedouin culture. Mansaf is eaten on different occasions such as funerals, weddings and on religious holidays. It consists of a plate of rice with meat that was boiled in thick yogurt, sprayed with nuts and sometimes herbs. As an old tradition, the dish is eaten using one's hands, but the tradition is not always used. Simple fresh fruit is often served towards the end of a Jordanian meal, but there is also dessert, such as baklava, hareeseh, knafeh, halva and qatayef, a dish made specially for Ramadan. In Jordanian cuisine, drinking coffee and tea flavoured with na'na or meramiyyeh is almost a ritual.|$|E

5|$|The priory prospered {{until the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540, {{when it was}} {{abolished}} along with England's other monastic communities. The priory buildings were demolished and the stone re-used in other buildings in Guisborough. The east end of the priory church was left standing with its great window forming a distinctive arch, a well-known landmark used as <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> Guisborough. It {{became part of the}} estate of the Chaloner family, who acquired it in 1550. The east window was preserved by them as part of a Romantic vista adjoining their seat, Gisborough Hall, from which the priory takes its idiosyncratically spelled name. It is owned by the Chaloners but is in the care of English Heritage as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{behind the}} church is Tre Kronor castle. Destroyed by fire in 1697 and {{subsequently}} replaced by the Stockholm Palace, it was named after the central citadel, a large gun tower emblazoned with the Three Crowns symbol, known as the first building in Stockholm and <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> the Swedish Crown. While {{it is not known}} when the symbol was first added to the citadel (it became the national coat of arms in the late 14th century), it was gilded during the 16th century. Again, the painting is strictly accurate, as the 1540s enlargement of the tower is not present in the image. The castle's eastern wing, the king's personal residence, was destroyed by fire in 1525 and in letters ten years later the king, burdened by debts of war to Lübeck, expressed his indignation over the fact that the reconstruction was still not completed. In the painting {{to the right of the}} church the eastern wing is accurately depicted as under construction, the exposed roof trusses confirming the inconvenience experienced by the monarch.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween, Billie {{tells the}} Halliwells {{her older sister}} Christy Jenkins (Marnette Patterson) was kidnapped by a demon 15 years prior. Billie's {{memories}} are rekindled when she is finding {{the location of a}} demon named Dogan (Eric Steinberg) and recognizes similarities between him and Christy's kidnapper. After this revelation, Billie's storylines focus on her search for her sister; the Halliwells worry about Billie becoming obsessed with finding Christy as she takes more risks to get information, such as interrogating and torturing demons. Billie accuses her parents of choosing to forget Christy rather than trying to locate her. Billie's mother Helen (Barbara Niven) gives her Christy's diary, in which Billie finds a pentagram on the last page. The pentagram is <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>for</b> the demonic council known as Triad (Steven J. Oliver, Seren Oliver, and Leland Crooke). She eventually gains enough control over her powers to travel to the past, speak to Christy, and find her location.|$|E
