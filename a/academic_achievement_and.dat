500|$|Liszt's intent, {{according}} to musicologist Hugh MacDonald, was for these single-movement works [...] "to display the traditional logic of symphonic thought." [...] In other words, Liszt wanted these works {{to display a}} complexity in their interplay of themes similar to that usually reserved for the opening movement of the Classical symphony; this principal self-contained section was normally considered the most important in the larger whole of the symphony in terms of <b>academic</b> <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> musical architecture. At the same time, Liszt wanted to incorporate the abilities of program music to inspire listeners to imagine scenes, images, or moods. To capture these dramatic and evocative qualities while achieving the scale of an opening movement, he combined elements of overture and symphony in a modified sonata design. The composition of the symphonic poems proved daunting. They underwent a continual process of creative experimentation that included many stages of composition, rehearsal and revision to reach a balance of musical form.|$|E
