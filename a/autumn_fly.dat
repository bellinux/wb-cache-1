50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 54-60 mm {{for males}} and 56-66 mm for females. Adults are on wing year-round. From South Africa, adults migrate from summer to <b>autumn.</b> They <b>fly</b> in a north-eastern direction.|$|R
6000|$|They {{went into}} the great court-yard. All men were quiet, yet all men were busy. Baking and brewing, carpentering and {{tailoring}} in the workshops, reading and writing in the cloister, praying and singing in the church, and teaching {{the children in the}} school-house. Only the ancient sempects--some near upon a hundred and fifty years old--wandered where they would, or basked against a sunny wall, like <b>autumn</b> <b>flies,</b> with each a young monk to guide him, and listen to his tattle of old days. For, said the laws of Turketul the good, [...] "Nothing disagreeable about the affairs of the monastery shall be mentioned in their presence. No person shall presume in any way to offend them; but with the greatest peace and tranquillity they shall await their end." ...|$|R
60|$|In <b>autumn</b> the {{swallows}} <b>fly</b> away {{to foreign}} lands; {{but there are}} some who are late in starting, and then they get so cold that they drop down as if dead, and the snow comes and covers them over.|$|R
50|$|Midcontinental white-fronted geese in North America {{have many}} {{breeding}} areas and each group in each breeding area differs in its migration time and wintering location. There are six breeding areas, including interior Alaska, the North Slope of Alaska, western Northwest Territories, western Nunavut, central Nunavut, and eastern Nunavut. These spatial differences lead to different departure times for white-fronted geese leaving their breeding areas. Birds from interior Alaska start migrating earlier during <b>autumn</b> and <b>fly</b> farther south to winter.|$|R
40|$|Females of the <b>autumn</b> crane <b>fly</b> Tipula (Platytipula) moiwana (Matsumura, 1916) were {{collected}} {{along the river}} Ljanselva in Oslo. This species was hitherto only known from the easternmost Palaearctic and from the Moscow and Tula regions in Russia. It has a characteristic wing pattern, which {{made it possible to}} distinguish even females from other known species in the subgenus Platytipula Matsumura, 1916. Its typical habitat and Palaearctic distribution are discussed. Posted here with permission from the journal. Norwegian Journal of Entomology: [URL] Norsk entomologisk forening: [URL]...|$|R

In <b>Autumn</b> 2012, Petit <b>flew</b> to New Orleans for the session. Dr. John appears on both [...] "Hubert’s Blues" [...] and [...] "Get You Off".|$|R
50|$|This is a {{distinctive}} species, all the wings being largely white {{except for a}} black blotch on the costa of the forewing. The wingspan is 20-24 mm. Often two broods are produced each year and the adults {{can be seen at}} any time during the summer and <b>autumn.</b> The species <b>flies</b> at night and is attracted to light and nectar-rich flowers.|$|R
5000|$|Dehorning can be {{performed}} on older animals and is normally performed with local anesthesia (cornual nerve block) by a veterinarian or a trained professional. Removal of larger horns is usually performed during spring and <b>autumn</b> to avoid <b>fly</b> season. Sedation may be recommended, especially for larger animals that require increased restraint. Use of longer-term pain medicine, like NSAIDs, is being researched in the US to ensure food safety.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first seven}} Re.2000 {{were sent to}} the Eastern Front on an {{experimental}} basis during <b>autumn</b> 1941. <b>Flying</b> alongside the Fiat CR.32s of 1/3 Fighter Company, the Reggiane pilots claimed eight kills, for one loss, [...] during three months of combat, against Soviet Air Force. In the summer of 1942, Hungarian Air Force contributed with its 1st Repülőcsoport (aviation detachment) to the German offensive Fall Blau. 1/1 Fighter Group (1./I Vadász Osztály) [...] equipped with 13 Re.2000s or Héjas, reached its first front base near Kursk on 2 July. By 3 August, 2/1 FS joined the other Hungarian fighter unit, that had moved to Ilvoskoje airfield. The task of 2/1 was to escort short-range reconnaissance aircraft, while 1/1 would support bombing missions.|$|R

The rock {{work in this}} garden displays every technique and effect used in Chinese gardens. In addition, it is a recreation of the five important mountains of China, and shows a mastery of creating a sense of vast space in a small area.|$|R
5000|$|Parts of {{the album}} were written by lead singer Keith Murray whilst staying between a rented cottage in Athens, Georgia, and Miami Beach, Florida. Barbara was then {{recorded}} in New York, Los Angeles and London. The album marks the first recorded with new drummer Andy Burrows, formerly of Razorlight. After Burrows parted with Razorlight in March 2009, he joined We Are Scientists in August of the same year, scheduling recording sessions with them during <b>autumn</b> 2009. The <b>Fly</b> reported a change in sound in the album, describing it as a [...] "return to the stripped-down sound of the band’s debut".|$|R
5000|$|After {{serving as}} Field Marshal Walter von Brauchitsch’s pilot during the brief Invasion of Poland, Knemeyer was {{assigned}} to the Rowehl Reconnaissance Group. During his time with this group Knemeyer flew hundreds of reconnaissance flights in every theater of the German war. In <b>autumn</b> 1939, Knemeyer <b>flew</b> a reconnaissance mission to Narvik, Norway to observe whether the British had occupied Narvik seaport. While on this mission Knemeyer took photographs of the British Home Fleet at Scapa Flow and outmaneuvered two Spitfires to escape with the photographs. Based on this intelligence [...] of the Kriegsmarine sank the British battleship [...] in a famous incident. For this, Knemeyer was awarded his first Iron Cross.|$|R

50|$|He {{claimed his}} first air victory, {{just three days}} after Italy entered war, on 13 June 1940. His first victim was a bomber, most {{probably}} a French Potez 630, shot down over Tunis, while flying his Fiat CR.42. Then he was posted to 78ª Squadriglia, 13° Gruppo of 2° Stormo and on 13 October he claimed a Gloster Gladiator (most probably from No. 112 Squadron RAF), while escorting a Savoia-Marchetti S.79, on Mersa Matruh, Egypt. After he had transferred to 4° Stormo (that became his permanent unit), in <b>autumn</b> 1941, he <b>flew</b> fighter sweeps over Malta, from Comiso in Sicily. Flying the Macchi C.202, in just two months, he claimed three Hurricanes (two on 19 October 1941) and a Blenheim. Still over Malta, he was credited with the destruction of three Spitfires (plus one probable) between 4 and 16 May 1942.|$|R
5000|$|Horns {{are removed}} {{because they can}} pose a risk to humans, other animals and to the bearers of the horns {{themselves}} (horns are sometimes caught in fences or prevent feeding). Dehorning is normally performed with local anesthesia and sedation by a veterinarian or a trained professional. Removal of larger horns is usually performed during spring and <b>autumn</b> to avoid <b>fly</b> season. In very large horns, [...] "tipping" [...] (removal of {{the tip of the}} horn) may be recommended to minimize bleeding. Dehorning is not routinely performed, since it is a difficult and painful process for the animal. Instead, most responsible breeders disbud (see below) their animals while young, when the process is quick and easy. [...] Dehorning is controversial, considered by some concerned with animal welfare to be cruelty because of the pain it can cause.|$|R
50|$|Brachycaudus helichrysi overwinters as fertilised eggs which hatch {{during the}} winter or early spring, before the plum and damson trees on which they are laid come into leaf. The fundatrices (viviparous {{parthenogenetic}} females produced on the primary host) feed at first {{at the base of}} buds but as the buds begin to expand, they move on to softer tissues, and later on to the new shoots and underside of the foliage. By May, some winged forms are beginning to appear and these fly to secondary hosts, such as Asteraceae, Chrysanthemum and Trifolium, where they found new colonies. The colonies on the primary host gradually die out. Further generations develop on the secondary hosts and in the <b>autumn,</b> winged forms <b>fly</b> back to the primary host. Here sexual forms develop, mating takes place and eggs are laid on twigs and spurs of the plum and damson trees. Natural enemies include ladybirds, lacewings, soldier beetles and hoverflies.|$|R
40|$|Oreina cacaliae (Schrank) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) has a 2 -year {{life cycle}} {{that it has}} to {{complete}} within the short warm seasons of the harsh alpine environment. Three years of field observations and experiments revealed that not all beetles overwintered in the soil next to their principal host Adenostyles alliariae (Asteraceae), as was previously assumed, but that many O. cacaliae left their host in <b>autumn</b> and <b>flew</b> to overwintering sites that were extensively sun-exposed. In spring, these individuals became active 2 months earlier than their conspecifics that had remained in the soil close to the host plant. These early beetles flew from their hibernation sites against the direction of the prevailing wind. After a random landing in snow, they walked to the spring host Petasites paradoxus (Asteraceae) and fed on its floral stalks, the only plant parts present at that time. A few weeks later, they took flight again to locate newly emerging A. alliariae on which they would feed and deposit larvae as did individuals that had overwintered close to A. alliariae. Leaves of A. alliariae contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), which the beetles sequester for their own defence. The dominating PA (seneciphylline) was also found to be present in the floral stalks of P. paradoxus. With additional behavioural assays in the field and laboratory, we demonstrated the importance of plant odours in the short-range host location process. This study reveals a unique hibernation behaviour in which part of the beetle population uses exceptionally warm locations from which they emerge in spring, long before all the snow has melted. This early, but risky emergence allows them to exploit a second, highly suitable host plant, which they locate first by wind-guided flight and then by odour-guided walking. The well-fed beetles then use odour again to move to their principal host plant, on which they reproduce...|$|R
5000|$|Notonecta glauca is {{a species}} of aquatic insect, and a type of backswimmer. It is the most {{widespread}} and abundant of the four British notonectids. They are also found throughout North America. Notonecta glauca are Hemiptera (true bug) predators, that are approximately 13-16 mm in length. They {{are the most common}} backswimmer species (49%). Females have a larger body size compared to males. These water insects swim and rest on their back (hence their common name [...] "Backswimmer" [...] or [...] "Water Boatman") and are found under the water surface. Notonecta glauca supports itself under the water surface by using their front legs and mid legs and the back end of its abdomen and rest them on the water surface; They are able to stay under the water surface by water tension, also known as the air-water interface (Surface tension). they use the hind legs as oars. Notonecta glauca will either wait for its prey to pass by or will swim and actively hunt its prey. When the weather is warm, usually in the late summer and <b>autumn,</b> they will <b>fly</b> between ponds. Notonecta glauca reproduce in the spring.|$|R
5000|$|The MKHL {{consequently}} {{became a}} significant purchaser of Italian aircraft {{and was the}} main operator of the Re.2000. Hungary bought 70 Reggiane Re.2000 Falco Is and then also acquired the licence-production rights for this model to produce a total of 200 aircraft, known as MÁVAG Héja ("Hawk") II built between 1940 and 1942. According to other sources,170-203 aircraft were built. The II series was the same aircraft with a different engine and Hungarian machine guns.The first aircraft received from Italy were sent to Debrecen to strengthen home defences, as there was danger that the growing crisis over Transylvania {{could lead to a}} conflict with Romania. Conflict was avoided and the Hungarian Reggianes were used on the Eastern Front, in the war against the Soviet Union.The first seven Re.2000 were sent to the front on an experimental basis in <b>autumn</b> 1941. <b>Flying</b> alongside the Fiat CR.32s of 1/3 Fighter Company, the Reggiane pilots claimed eight kills, for one loss, during three months of combat, against Soviet Air Force.

By 3 August, 2/1 FS joined the other Hungarian fighter unit, that had moved to Ilvoskoje airfield. The task of 2/1 was to escort short-range reconnaissance aircraft, while 1/1 would support bombing missions.Combat performance against the Soviet Air Force was satisfactory. On 4 August the Hungarians claimed their first kills, when Ens Vajda shot down two enemy aircraft.The first Hungarian ace of the war, 2/Lt Imre Pànczél, claimed his first air victories while flying the Re.2000, three of them in one sortie, in 1942. However, the Re.2000's flight characteristics were markedly different to the Fiat CR.32, from which Hungarian pilots frequently converted. The Re.2000 was much more prone to handling difficulties, especially stalls and spins, as well as reliability issues. All the 24 Re.2000s had suffered accidents (minor and major) within a month of combat deployment. Piaggio P.XI engine proved to be a mechanical nightmare for the mechanics. Landing and takeoff accidents were common on the rudimentary Russian airfields and due to the Re.2000 not having a rugged landing gear, compared to that of the CR.32. After a steel plate was added behind the cockpit to protect pilots, the shift in the aircraft's center of gravity led to more frequent accidents. In a much publicized mishap, 1/Lt István Horthy (the son of the Hungarian regent Miklós Horthy), serving as a fighter pilot with the Hungarian Second Army died flying a Re.2000 V-421 with 1/3 Fighter Squadron on 20 (on 18, according to other authors [...] ) August 1942, on his 25th operational sortie. After a pilot flying above asked Horthy to increase height, he pulled up rapidly, stalled and crashed. Nevertheless, the determined Hungarian pilots kept on flying combat missions and scoring a number of kills against the Soviet fighter, if they managed to force their Russian opponents into a dogfight, thanks to the maneuverability of the Italian built plane. The Hungarians Re.2000s had their most successful day on 9 August 1942. That day, near the village of Davidovka, 16 Ilyushin Il-2s and a similar number of LaGG-3S were intercepted by four Reggianes. The Hungarians downed four LaGGs, suffering the loss of the Re.2000 of Lt Takács, who crash-landed behind his own lines, wounded. The Hungarian Reggianes flew their last sorties on the Soviet front on 14 and 15 January 1943, when they took off for uneventful patrols and reconnaissance missions. Between 16 and 19 January, with the Red Army rapidly approaching Ilovskoje airfield, and with no time to heat the Piaggio engine's frozen oil, the mechanics had to blow up the last unserviceable Hejas.|$|R
