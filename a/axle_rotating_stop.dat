3000|$|Blocked Brake or Wheel: {{permanent}} braking of a wheel or an <b>axle</b> (<b>rotating</b> {{wheels and}} <b>axles</b> {{as well as}} blocking ones) [...]...|$|R
50|$|Two {{types of}} early Neolithic European {{wheel and axle}} are known; a circumalpine type of wagon {{construction}} (the wheel and <b>axle</b> <b>rotate</b> together, as in Ljubljana Marshes Wheel), {{and that of the}} Baden culture in Hungary (<b>axle</b> does not <b>rotate).</b> They both are dated to c. 3200-3000 BCE.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Having a {{radius of}} , the wheel {{is made of}} ash and oak. The {{aperture}} for the long axle is square, {{which means that the}} wheel and the <b>axle</b> <b>rotated</b> together. (The depicted wheel is a replica.) ...|$|R
50|$|Ripples may be {{generated}} by {{a piece of wood}} that is suspended above the tank on elastic bands so that it is just touching the surface. Screwed to wood is a motor that has an off centre weight attached to the axle. As the <b>axle</b> <b>rotates</b> the motor wobbles, shaking the wood and generating ripples.|$|R
50|$|It has a {{radius of}} 72 cm and {{is made of}} ash wood, and its 124 cm axle is made of oak. The axle was {{attached}} to the wheels with oak wood wedges, which meant that the <b>axle</b> <b>rotated</b> together with the wheels. The wheel was made from a tree that grew {{in the vicinity of the}} pile dwellings and at the time of the wheel construction was approximately 80 years old.|$|R
5000|$|The 1930s saw the {{invention}} of yet another signal. This was a unique combination of highway flasher and <b>rotating</b> <b>stop</b> sign. An approaching train would trigger not just the requisite red flashing lights and bells, but a mechanism that <b>rotated</b> a yellow <b>stop</b> sign ninety degrees to face traffic as well. (The signs eventually changed to red.) [...] This type of signal was relatively common throughout the midwestern United States; few made their way out west.|$|R

5000|$|Wheel and axle: Hoist, winch, {{rack and}} pinion, chain drive, belt drive, rigid chain and rigid belt {{actuators}} {{operate on the}} principle of the wheel and <b>axle.</b> A <b>rotating</b> wheel moves a cable, rack, chain or belt to produce linear motion.|$|R
50|$|Allowance is {{basically}} the size difference between components that work together. Allowance between parts that are assembled is very important. For example, the axle of a car has to be supported in a bearing otherwise it will fall to the ground. If there was no gap between the axle and the bearing {{then there would be}} a lot of friction and it would be difficult to get the car to move. If there was too much of a gap then the axle would be jumping around in the bearing. It is important to get the Allowance between the axle and the bearing correct so that the <b>axle</b> <b>rotates</b> smoothly and easily without judder.|$|R
5000|$|A {{full-floating axle}} shaft does not carry the vehicle's weight; it serves only to {{transmit}} torque from the differential to the wheels. It [...] "floats" [...] inside an assembly {{that carries the}} vehicle's weight. Thus the only stress it must endure is torque (not lateral bending force). Full-floating axle shafts are retained by a flange bolted to the hub, while the hub and bearings are retained on the spindle by a large nut. In contrast, a semi-floating design carries {{the weight of the}} vehicle on the axle shaft itself; there is a single bearing {{at the end of the}} axle housing that carries the load from the axle and that the <b>axle</b> <b>rotates</b> through.|$|R
50|$|As of November 2016, {{there are}} only half a dozen known Griswold signals still in service along active rail, all in Minnesota, none with <b>rotating</b> <b>stop</b> sign signals. The last pair with an {{operating}} banner protected 22nd Ave NE in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Griswolds in Tacoma, Washington and San Jose, California were both removed circa 2010.|$|R
50|$|The HOSSACK front {{suspension}} system consists of 2 wish-bones, an upright and steering linkage. Similar components are found {{on the front of}} all racing cars, the only significant difference being in the up-right which has its geometry rearranged. The wish-bones look and work exactly like their racing car equivalent. The up-right performs the same task as its racing car equivalent but has its <b>axle</b> <b>rotated</b> through 90 degrees and over hung. The steering link does the same job as its name sake in car suspension. There is a handle bar pivot but this carries none of the suspension loading and only has to handle the weight of the riderâ€™s upper half. The spring/damper element can been run in several different positions to achieve different conditions as is also common in the racing car world.|$|R
50|$|At {{a roller}} unit, the truck places {{each set of}} wheels on the rollers as it leaves the plant. At this point the washing process is {{automatically}} triggered. While the wheels of each <b>axle</b> are <b>rotated</b> automatically, water is sprayed out from strategically placed nozzles to clean the tires, wheel wells and mud flaps.|$|R
5000|$|Wheel and axle: Hoist, winch, {{rack and}} pinion, chain drive, belt drive, rigid chain and rigid belt {{actuators}} {{operate on the}} principle of the wheel and <b>axle.</b> By <b>rotating</b> a wheel/axle (e.g. drum, gear, pulley or shaft) a linear member (e.g. cable, rack, chain or belt) moves. By moving the linear member, the wheel/axle rotates.|$|R
40|$|A bicycle {{wheel is}} rolled down an incline on a thin axle, {{as shown in}} Figure 1. It can be rolled in either of two conditions- (a) with its <b>axle</b> free to <b>rotate</b> on its {{bearings}} {{at the center of}} the wheel, or (b) with the wheel pinned to the axle so the wheel and <b>axle</b> system <b>rotate</b> together. In case (a), the initial gravitational potential energy lost by the wheel is converted into translational kinetic energy, and the wheel rolls rapidly down the incline. In case (b), the lost gravitational potential energy is converted into both rotational kinetic energy and translational kinetic energy. Because the wheel is weighted along its rim, it moves down the incline much more slowly in case (b) ...|$|R
50|$|When one rotates {{the fine}} {{focusing}} knob, the three balls {{are driven by}} the input <b>axle</b> and <b>rotate</b> along the inner circumference of the case at a slower speed. The metal balls then push the holder shelf and drive the output axle. As a result, rotating either of the focusing knobs will cause the other to rotate in the same direction.|$|R
50|$|By contrast, {{a locked}} {{differential}} forces both {{left and right}} wheels on the same <b>axle</b> to <b>rotate</b> {{at the same speed}} under nearly all circumstances, without regard to tractional differences seen at either wheel. Therefore, each wheel can apply as much rotational force as the traction under it will allow, and the torques on each side-shaft will be unequal. (Unequal torque, equal rotational speeds). Exceptions apply to automatic lockers, discussed below.|$|R
5000|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering, {{an eccentric}} is a circular disk (eccentric sheave) solidly fixed to a <b>rotating</b> <b>axle</b> with its centre offset {{from that of}} the axle (hence the word [...] "", out of the centre).|$|R
50|$|The Dry Tortugas Light {{received}} an electric lamp in 1931, becoming {{the most powerful}} lighthouse in America, with three million candela. The <b>rotating</b> beacon <b>stopped</b> working in April 2014, and was formally decommissioned in December 2015.|$|R
50|$|On many {{recorders}} the tachometer spindle {{is connected}} by an <b>axle</b> to a <b>rotating</b> magnet that induces a changing magnetic field upon a Hall effect transistor. Other systems connect the spindle to a stroboscope, which alternates {{light and dark}} upon a photodiode.|$|R
50|$|The {{tapered roller}} bearing in {{combination}} with modern lubricants is extremely durable and is used almost universally in applications involving <b>rotating</b> <b>axle</b> and transmission shafts. Bearing durability is such that these shafts often require no maintenance {{for hundreds of thousands}} of kilometers of operation.|$|R
50|$|In motor vehicles, the {{transmission}} generally {{is connected to}} the engine crankshaft via a flywheel or clutch or fluid coupling, partly because internal combustion engines cannot run below a particular speed. The output of {{the transmission}} is transmitted via the driveshaft to one or more differentials, which drives the wheels. While a differential may also provide gear reduction, its primary purpose is to permit the wheels at either end of an <b>axle</b> to <b>rotate</b> at different speeds (essential to avoid wheel slippage on turns) as it changes the direction of rotation.|$|R
50|$|The M9 had tandem {{rear axles}} {{and a single}} front <b>axle</b> on a <b>rotating</b> dolly. Ramps hinged down at the rear end of the trailer. Cable rollers and sheaves let the winch from the M20 truck pull tanks onto the trailer, chocks and chains were used to secure the load.|$|R
5000|$|A {{few yards}} East of the Tunnel of Fun was [...] "Laff in the Dark", a more {{conventional}} [...] "dark ride", where patrons would sit behind a safety bar in a high backed, cutaway cylindrical car which moved forward, <b>rotated,</b> <b>stopped,</b> or reversed in a seemingly random fashion as it followed a fast and erratic course through a darkened room filled {{with a variety of}} surprising, and brightly lit [...] "flash frights", triggered by the position of the car, by which the hapless passengers were forced to confront up close and personal. Drawing attention to this ride was [...] "Laffing Sal", another mechanical device {{in the form of an}} overweight, and rather homely-looking female who did no more than emit a constant stream of insane laughter, while doubling over again and again to the delight of all, excepting a few frightened children.|$|R
5000|$|The Core, in {{an early}} scene, people with {{pacemakers}} mysteriously drop dead during Green World Day; it is later known that the core <b>stopped</b> <b>rotating</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Assuming {{the wheel}} and axle does not {{dissipate}} or store energy, that is it has no friction or elasticity, the power input by the force applied to the wheel must equal the power output at the axle. As {{the wheel and}} <b>axle</b> system <b>rotates</b> around its bearings, points on the circumference, or edge, of the wheel move faster than points on the circumference, or edge, of the axle. Therefore, a force applied {{to the edge of}} the wheel must be less than the force applied {{to the edge of the}} axle, because power is the product of force and velocity.|$|R
50|$|A coil pump {{is a low}} {{lift pump}} which is {{composed}} of a tube, shaped as a coil and mounted on a <b>rotating</b> <b>axle</b> powered by an engine or an animal capable of turning the axle around rapidly. Due to the rotation, water is then {{picked up by the}} tube and pumped upwards in the hose.|$|R
50|$|An {{undershot}} {{wheel is}} a vertically mounted water wheel with a horizontal <b>axle</b> that is <b>rotated</b> {{by the water}} from a low weir striking the wheel in the bottom quarter. Most of the energy gain is from {{the movement of the}} water and comparatively little from the head. They are similar in operation and design to stream wheels.|$|R
50|$|This {{system is}} less {{expensive}} to install than a center pivot, but much more labor-intensive to operate - it does not travel automatically across the field: it applies water in a stationary strip, must be drained, and then rolled to a new strip. Most systems use 4 or 5 in diameter aluminum pipe. The pipe doubles both as water transport and as an <b>axle</b> for <b>rotating</b> all the wheels. A drive system (often found near {{the centre of the}} wheel line) rotates the clamped-together pipe sections as a single axle, rolling the whole wheel line. Manual adjustment of individual wheel positions may be necessary if the system becomes misaligned.|$|R
40|$|Bogie {{architecture}} (solid <b>axles</b> or independently <b>rotating</b> wheels, monobloc or resilient wheels) has {{a fundamental}} {{impact on the}} contact forces exchanged at wheel-rail interface, especially when considering small radius curves, which are typical of urban tramways. The paper investigates how the contact forces change depending on the adopted bogie architecture, by means of multibody simulation of tramcar behaviour during curve negotiation...|$|R
6000|$|He buttoned up {{his jacket}} and {{addressed}} himself to the habitable globe, with as good an assumption of confidence as lay in his power. [...] "Jest <b>stop</b> <b>rotating,</b> will you," [...] said Mr. Fotheringay.|$|R
50|$|Brakes are {{generally}} applied to <b>rotating</b> <b>axles</b> or wheels, {{but may also}} take other forms such as {{the surface of a}} moving fluid (flaps deployed into water or air). Some vehicles use a combination of braking mechanisms, such as drag racing cars with both wheel brakes and a parachute, or airplanes with both wheel brakes and drag flaps raised into the air during landing.|$|R
50|$|An early {{chronograph}} {{that measures}} velocity directly {{was built in}} 1804 by Grobert, a colonel in the French Army. This used a rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>axle</b> with two disks mounted on it about 13 feet apart. The bullet was fired parallel to the axle, and the angular displacement of {{the holes in the}} two disks, together with the rotational speed of the axle, yielded the bullet velocity.|$|R
50|$|The Cub Lo-Boy, {{introduced}} in 1955, was a lowered {{version of the}} Standard Cub. The rear <b>axle</b> housings were <b>rotated,</b> lowering the tractor about 7-8 inches. Also, the front axle extensions were lowered, and the tractor wheelbase was shortened to 62Â½ inches. These modifications lowered the center of gravity, and decreased the turning radius, which made the tractor more maneuverable improving the mowing capability of the Cub.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{robotic system}} semiautomatically grasps <b>rotating</b> object, <b>stops</b> rotation, and pulls object {{to rest in}} fixture. Based on {{combination}} of advanced techniques for sensing and control, constructed to test concepts for robotic recapture of spinning artificial satellites. Potential terrestrial applications for technology developed with help of system includes tracking and grasping of industrial parts on conveyor belts, tracking of vehicles and animals, and soft grasping of moving objects in general...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{construction}} cranes {{where the}} work speed {{was determined by}} the relatively slow progress of the masons, harbor cranes usually featured double treadwheels to speed up loading. The two treadwheels whose diameter is estimated to be 4 m or larger were attached to each side of the <b>axle</b> and <b>rotated</b> together. Their capacity was 2-3 tons which apparently corresponded to the customary size of marine cargo. Today, according to one survey, fifteen treadwheel harbor cranes from pre-industrial times are still extant throughout Europe. Some harbour cranes were specialised at mounting masts to newly built sailing ships, such as in Danzig, Cologne and Bremen. Beside these stationary cranes, floating cranes which could be flexibly deployed in the whole port basin came into use by the 14th century.|$|R
