60|$|Like {{his brother}} chief, however, he {{experienced}} considerable difficulty, especially in distinguishing {{the difference between}} the left <b>arm-hole</b> and the breast pocket, despite the able assistance of Waroonga. At last he got the coat partially on, and with a mighty heave, forced it upon his broad shoulders. Then he stood with arms awkwardly curved and extended, uncertain what to do next. He was by no means properly into the garment, and his look of solemn inquiry said as much to the missionary.|$|E

6000|$|No {{observation}} {{being offered}} by anybody in elucidation of this enigma, the shepherd's wife once more {{called for a}} song. The same obstacles presented themselves as at the former time--one had no voice, another had forgotten the first verse. The stranger at the table, whose soul had now risen to a good working temperature, relieved the difficulty by exclaiming that, to start the company, he would sing himself. Thrusting one thumb into the <b>arm-hole</b> of his waistcoat, he waved the other hand in the air, and, with an extemporizing gaze at the shining sheep-crooks above the mantelpiece, began:- ...|$|E
60|$|These Powder-monkeys, as {{they are}} called, enact a curious part in time of action. The {{entrance}} to the magazine on the berth-deck, where they procure their food for the guns, is guarded by a woollen screen; and a gunner's mate, standing behind it, thrusts out the cartridges through a small <b>arm-hole</b> in this screen. The enemy's shot (perhaps red hot) are flying in all directions; and to protect their cartridges, the powder-monkeys hurriedly wrap them up in their jackets; and with all haste scramble up the ladders to their respective guns, like eating-house waiters hurrying along with hot cakes for breakfast.|$|E
6000|$|... “I won it,” {{cried the}} other, “with my sword and my spear. There was a mousquetaire that had it round his neck—such a big mousquetaire, {{as big as}} General Webb. I called out to him to surrender, and that I’d give him quarter: he called me a petit polisson, and fired his pistol at me, and then sent it at my head with a curse. I rode at him, sir, drove my sword right under his <b>arm-hole,</b> and broke it in the rascal’s body. I found a purse in his holster with sixty-five louis in it, and a bundle of love-letters, and a flask of Hungary-water. Vive la guerre! there are the ten pieces you lent me. I should {{like to have a}} fight every day;” and he pulled at his little {{moustache}} and bade a servant bring a supper to Captain Esmond.|$|E
60|$|Madonna ran to look: {{then turned}} round, {{and with a}} comic air of disappointment, hooked her thumbs in the <b>arm-holes</b> of an {{imaginary}} waistcoat. Only Mr. Gimble, the picture-dealer, who always criticized works of art {{with his hands in}} that position.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{just let}} me direct Miss Hemming how to make some of these things. You will be {{surprised}} to see how much I know about piping hems and gathering <b>arm-holes</b> and shirring biases," [...] began Dr. Alec, patting a pile of muslin, cloth and silk with a knowing air.|$|R
6000|$|... "It ain't quite a story," [...] he began--and in {{beginning}} {{he cleared}} his throat with emphasis, thrust his thumbs into the <b>arm-holes</b> of his vest, and tilted his chair on its hind-legs--"it ain't quite a story; it's a hanecdote, a sort of hincident, so to speak, and this is 'ow it 'appened:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{if anybody}} thinks the act, {{on the part}} of Tim Rokens, bore the {{smallest}} resemblance to the generally received idea of that sorrowful affection, [...] "anybody," [...] we take leave to tell him, is very much mistaken. The bold harpooner did it thus--he suddenly unhooked his right hand from the <b>arm-hole</b> of his vest, and gave his right thigh a slap which produced a crack that would have made a small pistol envious; then he uttered a succession of ferocious roars, that might have quite well indicated pain, or grief, or madness, or a drunken cheer, and, un-hooking the left hand, he doubled himself up, and thrust both knuckles into his eyes. The knuckles were wet when he pulled them out of his eyes, but he dried them on his pantaloons, bolted up the hatchway, and rushing up to the man at the wheel, demanded in a voice of thunder--"How's 'er head?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "CARRIE'S all right. She's finicky, but she'll {{get over}} it. But I wish she'd hurry up about it! What she can't {{understand}} is that a fellow practising medicine {{in a small town}} like this has got to cut out the highbrow stuff, and not spend all his time going to concerts and shining his shoes. (Not but what he might be just as good at all these intellectual and art things as some other folks, if he had the time for it!)" [...] Dr. Will Kennicott was brooding in his office, during a free moment {{toward the end of the}} summer afternoon. He hunched down in his tilted desk-chair, undid a button of his shirt, glanced at the state news in the back of the Journal of the American Medical Association, dropped the magazine, leaned back with his right thumb hooked in the <b>arm-hole</b> of his vest and his left thumb stroking the back of his hair.|$|E
60|$|Far {{some days}} I had noticed {{a good deal}} of excitement, and many strangers came and went armed with spears and cutlasses, bows and shields. I now found there was war near us--two {{neighbouring}} villages having a quarrel about some matter of local politics that I could not understand. They told me it was quite a common thing, and that they are rarely without fighting somewhere near. Individual quarrels are taken up by villages and tribes, and the nonpayment of the stipulated price for a wife {{is one of the most}} frequent causes of bitterness and bloodshed. One of the war shields was brought me to look at. It was made of rattans and covered with cotton twist, so as to be both light, strong, and very tough. I should think it would resist any ordinary bullet. Abort the middle there was au <b>arm-hole</b> with a shutter or flap over it. This enables the arm to be put through and the bow drawn, while the body and face, up to the eyes, remain protected, which cannot be done if the shield is carried on the arm by loops attached at the back in the ordinary way. A few of the young men from our house went to help their friends, but I could not bear that any of them were hurt, or that there was much hard fighting.|$|E

What should you say now to L100 down, and all {{expenses}} paid?" [...] Mr. Whittington {{leaned back in his}} chair, and thrust his thumbs into the <b>arm-holes</b> of his waistcoat.|$|R

6000|$|... "And she {{has refused}} me. Now {{you know the}} whole of it,--the whole history of what I have done while I have been away." [...] And he stood up before her, with his thumbs thrust into the <b>arm-holes</b> of his waistcoat, with {{something}} serious and almost solemn in his gait, {{in spite of a}} smile which played about his mouth.|$|R
6000|$|To this {{machinery}} {{the complications}} {{arising from the}} socially so fierce London June inevitably (and in fact mercifully) drive me; for I feel the assault, the attack on one's time and one's strength, even in my so simplified and disqualified state; which it is my one great effort not to allow to be knocked about. However, I of course do succeed in simplifying and in guarding myself enormously; one can't but succeed when the question is so vital as it has now become with me. Which is really but a preface to telling you how much {{the most interesting thing}} in the matter has been, during the last three weeks, my regular sittings for my portrait to Sargent; which have numbered now some seven or eight, I forget which, and with but a couple more to come. So the thing is, I make out, very nearly finished, and the head apparently (as I much hope) to have almost nothing more done to it. It is, I infer, a very great success; a number of the competent and intelligent have seen it, and so pronounce it in the strongest terms.... In short it seems likely to be one of S.'s very fine things. One is almost full-face, with one's left arm over the corner of one's chair-back and the hand brought round so that the thumb is caught in the <b>arm-hole</b> of one's waistcoat, and said hand therefore, with the fingers a bit folded, entirely visible and [...] "treated." [...] Of course I'm sitting a little askance in the chair. The canvas comes down to just where my watch-chain (such as it is, poor thing!) is hung across the waistcoat: which latter, in itself, is found to be splendidly (poor thing though it also be) and most interestingly treated. Sargent can make such things so interesting--such things as my coat-lappet and shoulder and sleeve too! But what is most interesting, every one is agreed, is the mouth--than which even he has never painted a more living and, as I am told, [...] "expressive"! In fact I can quite see that myself; and really, I seem to feel, the thing will be all that can at the best (the best with such a subject!) have been expected of it. I only wish you and Alice had assisted at some of the sittings--as Sargent likes animated, sympathetic, beautiful, talkative friends to do, in order to correct by their presence too lugubrious expressions. I take for granted I shall before long have a photograph to send you, and then you will be able partially to judge for yourselves.|$|E

Glancing at a scrap of manuscript, Mr. Sapsea reads it to himself with a lofty air, and then, slowly pacing the room with his thumbs in the <b>arm-holes</b> of his waistcoat, repeats it from memory: so internally, though with much dignity, that the word ‘Ethelinda’ is alone audible.|$|R
6000|$|... "And why shouldn't {{he want to}} see me? Gus, I {{expect the}} truth from you. How are things going on here?" [...] To this {{question}} Mr. Musselboro made no immediate answer; but tilted himself {{back in his chair}} and took his hat off, and put his thumbs into the <b>arm-holes</b> of his waistcoat, and looked his patroness full in the face.

60|$|Round {{the top was}} a deep hem {{through which}} was run a thin cord. By the aid of this it could be drawn {{together}} and gathered in at the neck. Six inches from the top, two of the seams between the flags were left open, these were for the <b>arm-holes.</b> This primitive pinafore was to be drawn in at the waist by a belt. The man had chosen from among the signal flags those whose colours went best together, and though the result was extremely motley, it was yet a very fair substitute for a dress. The three officers could not help laughing as he brought it aft to show them.|$|R
60|$|Ida Barton's {{swimming}} {{suit was}} a very nice one, as women's suits go. Of thinnest of firm-woven black wool, with white trimmings and a white belt-line, it was high-throated, short-sleeved, and brief- skirted. Brief as was the skirt, the leg-tights were no less brief. Yet on the beach in front of the adjacent Outrigger Club, and entering and leaving the water, a score of women, not provoking gasping notice, were more daringly garbed. Their men's suits, as brief of leg-tights and skirts, fitted them as snugly, but were sleeveless after the way of men's suits, the <b>arm-holes</b> deeply low- cut and in-cut, and, by the exposed armpits, advertiseful that the wearers were accustomed to 1916 decollete.|$|R
60|$|Fronting him, sixthly and lastly, was {{situated}} a singularly stiff-looking personage, who, being afflicted with paralysis, must, to speak seriously, have felt very {{ill at ease}} in his unaccommodating habiliments. He was habited, somewhat uniquely, {{in a new and}} handsome mahogany coffin. Its top or head-piece pressed upon the skull of the wearer, and extended over it in the fashion of a hood, giving to the entire face an air of indescribable interest. <b>Arm-holes</b> had been cut in the sides, for the sake not more of elegance than of convenience; but the dress, nevertheless, prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect as his associates; and as he lay reclining against his tressel, at an angle of forty-five degrees, a pair of huge goggle eyes rolled up their awful whites towards the ceiling in absolute amazement at their own enormity.|$|R
6000|$|Pen {{looked very}} grave, pompous, and dandified. He was unusually smart and {{brilliant}} in his costume. His white duck trousers and white hat, his neckcloth of many colours, his light waistcoat, gold chains, and shirt-studs, {{gave him the}} air of a prince of the blood at least. How his splendour became his figure! Was anybody ever like him? some one thought. He blushed--how his blushes became him! the same individual said to herself. The children, on seeing him the day before, had been so struck with him, that after he had gone away they had been playing at him. And Ameliar-Ann, sticking her little chubby fingers into the <b>arm-holes</b> of her pinafore, as Pen was wont to do with his waistcoat, had said, [...] "Now, Bessy-Jane, I'll be Missa Pendennis." [...] Fanny had laughed till she cried, and smothered her sister with kisses for that feat. How happy, too, she was to see Arthur embracing the child! ...|$|R
60|$|But his {{situation}} {{was beginning to}} become critical. Flash-in-the-Pan, {{who seemed to have}} been a man of choleric humor, taking fire during some hotly contested argument, discharged both his pistols at the breast of his opponent. The balls passed through on each side immediately below his arm-pits, making a clean hole, through which the horrified broker could see the firelight behind him. The wounded man, without betraying any concern, excited the laughter of the company, by jocosely putting his arms akimbo, and inserting his thumbs into the orifices of the wounds, {{as if they had been}} <b>arm-holes.</b> This having in a measure restored good-humor, the party joined hands and formed a circle preparatory to dancing. The dance was commenced by some monotonous stanzas hummed in a very high key by one of the party, the rest joining in the following chorus, which seemed to present a familiar sound to the broker's ear.|$|R
60|$|Look at the sailor, {{called the}} mincer, who now comes along, and {{assisted}} by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off {{with it as}} if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as almost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some three feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two slits for <b>arm-holes</b> at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it. The mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adequately protect him, while employed in the peculiar functions of his office.|$|R
6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} our hero was {{divested}} of his wet garments, rubbed perfectly dry by his kind messmates, and clad in dry costume, after which he felt almost as well as if nothing unusual had happened to him. The men meanwhile cut their jokes at him or {{at each other as}} they stood round and watched, assisted, or retarded the process. As for Tim Rokens, {{who had been in the}} boat and witnessed the rescue, he stood gazing steadfastly at Glynn without uttering a word, keeping his thumbs the while hooked in the <b>arm-holes</b> of his vest, and his legs very much apart. By degrees--as he thought on what had passed, and the narrow escape poor little Ailie had had, and the captain's tears, things he had never seen the captain shed before and had not believed the captain to have possessed--as he pondered these things, we say, his knotty visage began to work, and his cast-iron chin began to quiver, and his shaggy brows contracted, and his nose, besides becoming purple, began to twist, as if it were an independent member of his face, and he came, in short, to that climax which is familiarly expressed by the words [...] "bursting into tears." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Clinton {{went back}} to the office; it was his boast that for ten years he had never missed a day. But he was dazed; he did his work mechanically, and so distracted was he that, on going home in the evening, he forgot to remove his paper cuffs, and his wife remarked upon them while they were supping. Mrs Clinton was a short, stout person, with an {{appearance}} of immense determination; her black, shiny hair was parted in the middle--the parting was broad and very white--severely brushed back and gathered into a little knot {{at the back of the}} head; her face was red and strongly lined, her eyes spirited, her nose aggressive, her mouth resolute. Everyone has some one procedure which seems most exactly to suit him--a slim youth bathing in a shaded stream, an alderman standing with his back to the fire and his thumbs in the <b>arm-holes</b> of his waistcoat--and Mrs Clinton expressed her complete self, exhibiting every trait and attribute, on Sunday in church, when she sat in the front pew self-reliantly singing the hymns in the wrong key. It was then that she seemed more than ever the personification of a full stop. Her morals were above suspicion, and her religion Low Church.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal," [...] began Silas, tipping {{his chair}} back against the wall, and putting his thumbs in the <b>arm-holes</b> of his waistcoat, [...] "I jined a cavalry {{regiment}} durin' the war, and see a consid'able amount of fightin'. My horse, Major, was a fust-rate animal, and I was as fond on him as ef he'd ben a human critter. He warn't harnsome, {{but he was the}} best-tempered, stiddyest, lovenest brute I ever see. I fust battle we went into, he gave me a lesson that I didn't forgit in a hurry, and I'll tell you how it was. It ain't no use tryin' to picter the noise and hurry, and general horridness of a battle to you young fellers, for I ain't no words to do it in; but I'm free to confess that I got so sort of confused and upset at the fust on it, that I didn't know what I was about. We was ordered to charge, and went ahead like good ones, never stoppin' to pick up them that went down in the scrimmage. I got a shot in the arm, and was pitched out of the saddle don't know how, but there I was left behind with two or three others, dead and wounded, for the rest went on, as I say. Wal, I picked myself up and looked round for Major, feeling as ef I'd had about enough for that spell. I didn't see him nowhere, and was kinder walking back to camp, when I heard a whinny that sounded nateral. I looked round, and there was Major stopping for me a long way off, and lookin' as ef he didn't understand why I was loiterin' behind. I whistled, and he trotted up to me as I'd trained him to do. I mounted as well as I could with my left arm bleedin' and was for going on to camp, for I declare I felt as sick and wimbly as a woman; folks often do in their fust battle. But, no sir! Major was the bravest of the two, and he wouldn't go, not a peg; he jest rared up, and danced, and snorted, and acted as ef the smell of powder and the noise had drove him half wild. I done my best, but he wouldn't give in, so I did; {{and what do you think}} that plucky brute done? He wheeled slap round, and galloped back like a hurricane, right into the thickest of the scrimmage!" ...|$|R
60|$|At Caversham {{there was}} a very grand party,--as grand almost as a dinner party can be in the country. There were the Earl and Countess of Loddon and Lady Jane Pewet from Loddon Park, and the bishop and his wife, and the Hepworths. These, with the Carburys and the parson's family, and the people staying in the house, made twenty-four at the dinner table. As there were {{fourteen}} ladies and only ten men, the banquet can hardly be said to have been very well arranged. But those things cannot be done in the country with the exactness which the appliances of London make easy; and then the Longestaffes, though they were decidedly people of fashion, were not famous for their excellence in arranging such matters. If aught, however, was lacking in exactness, it was made up in grandeur. There were three powdered footmen, and {{in that part of the}} country Lady Pomona alone was served after this fashion; and {{there was a}} very heavy butler, whose appearance of itself was sufficient to give éclat to a family. The grand saloon in which nobody ever lived was thrown open, and sofas and chairs on which nobody ever sat were uncovered. It was not above once in the year that this kind of thing vas done at Caversham; but when it was done, nothing was spared which could contribute to the magnificence of the fête. Lady Pomona and her two tall daughters standing up to receive the little Countess of Loddon and Lady Jane Pewet, who was the image of her mother on a somewhat smaller scale, while Madame Melmotte and Marie stood behind as though ashamed of themselves, was a sight to see. Then the Carburys came, and then Mrs Yeld with the bishop. The grand room was soon fairly full; but nobody had a word to say. The bishop was generally a man of much conversation, and Lady Loddon, if she were well pleased with her listeners, could talk by the hour without ceasing. But on this occasion nobody could utter a word. Lord Loddon pottered about, making a feeble attempt, in which he was seconded by no one. Lord Alfred stood, stock-still, stroking his grey moustache with his hand. That much greater man, Augustus Melmotte, put his thumbs into the <b>arm-holes</b> of his waistcoat, and was impassible. The bishop saw at a glance the hopelessness of the occasion, and made no attempt. The master of the house shook hands with each guest as he entered, and then devoted his mind to expectation of the next corner. Lady Pomona and her two daughters were grand and handsome, but weary and dumb. In accordance with the treaty, Madame Melmotte had been entertained civilly for four entire days. It could not be expected that the ladies of Caversham should come forth unwearied after such a struggle.|$|R
