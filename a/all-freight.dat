25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, Aer Lingus {{introduced}} routes to Brussels, Amsterdam via Manchester and to Rome. Because of the expanding route structure the airline {{became one of}} the early purchasers of Vickers Viscount 700s in 1951, which were placed in service in April 1954. In 1952, the airline expanded its <b>all-freight</b> services and acquired a small fleet of Bristol 170 Freighters, which remained in service until 1957.|$|E
25|$|From 1980 {{the airline}} {{operated}} a single Boeing 737-2R4C. The aircraft was bought through {{a partnership with}} the Norwegian Armed Forces, in which it was specially equipped to meet military needs. Specifically, it was a combi variant, which encompassed a side loading door and the possibility to quickly rearrange the interior between all-passenger, <b>all-freight,</b> combined passenger and freight, as well as VIP configuration. The aircraft was designed to be able to operate out from gravel runways and was also as the only 737 certified to be used for parachuting.|$|E

50|$|It {{was planned}} to {{have a number of}} {{variants}} with seating starting at 150-156 passengers, to a larger variant for 200 passengers, and it was also planned to build a combination passenger/freight and an <b>all-freight</b> variant.|$|E
50|$|Magic Blue Airlines was {{a charter}} {{passenger}} airline based in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It was previously an <b>all-freight</b> operator and intended to operate charter services from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport to Mediterranean holiday destinations starting later in 2005 using BAe ATP aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The airline started {{operations}} during March 1964 {{with one}} Lockheed Constellation and three more were acquired in August 1965. The airline was awarded an [...] "E" [...] Licence in January 1964 {{to carry out}} non-scheduled <b>all-freight</b> operations from the UKs Air Transport Licensing Board (ATLB). An application in February 1965 for permission to operate scheduled all-cargo services on a London-Middle East-Far East-Australia route {{was rejected by the}} ATLB in May 1965.|$|E

The station is also a freight terminal on the Japan Freight Railway Company, {{as well as the}} terminus for the <b>all-freight</b> Honmoku Line of the Kanagawa Rinkai Railway.|$|E

50|$|Richman, who had {{recently}} gained his pilot's license, {{had been able to}} secure a Vultee V-1A capable of making the flight. The aircraft, NC13770, had originally been built for Lieutenant Colonel George R. Hutchinson's proposed <b>all-freight</b> New York-London-Moscow airline, which never started up. Since then it had served a number of pilots in various record setting flights; in 1935 Jimmy Doolittle used the aircraft to make a record 11-hour-59-minute transcontinental flight, and six weeks later Leland Andrews repeated the flight, then used it to set a long-distance speed record between Los Angeles and Mexico City.|$|E
50|$|Anjō Station {{was opened}} 16 June 1891 when {{the section of}} the Japanese Government Railways (JGR) line {{connecting}} Okazaki with Kariya was completed. This line was named Tōkaidō Line in 1895, and the Tōkaidō Main Line in 1909. An <b>all-freight</b> spur line operated by the privately held Hekinan Electric Railway connected Anjō to Hekinan in 1939 and began passenger operations from March 1951, but was discontinued in 1961. In October 1980, the JNR discontinued all freight services to Anjō Station. With the privatization and dissolution of the JNR on 1 April 1987, the station came {{under the control of the}} Central Japan Railway Company. At that time, an additional side platform was constructed.|$|E
5000|$|... "Strategic" [...] cargo {{aircraft}} {{became an}} important class of their own starting with the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy in the 1960s {{and a number of}} similar Soviet designs from the 70s and 80s, and culminating in the Antonov An-225, the world's largest aircraft. These designs offer the ability to carry the heaviest loads, even main battle tanks, at global ranges. The Boeing 747 was originally designed to the same specification as the C-5, but later modified as a design that could be offered as either passenger or <b>all-freight</b> versions. The [...] "bump" [...] {{on the top of the}} fuselage allows the crew area to be clear of the cargo containers sliding out of the front in the event of an accident.|$|E
50|$|In 1947, Aerlínte Éireann {{came into}} {{existence}} {{with the purpose of}} operating transatlantic flights to New York City from Ireland. The airline ordered five new Lockheed L-749 Constellations, but a change of government and a financial crisis prevented the service from starting. John A Costello, the incoming Fine Gael Taoiseach (Prime Minister), was not a keen supporter of air travel and thought that flying the Atlantic was too grandiose a scheme for a small airline from a small country like Ireland.During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Aer Lingus introduced routes to Brussels, Amsterdam via Manchester and to Rome. Because of the expanding route structure the airline became one of the early purchasers of Vickers Viscount 700s in 1951, which were placed in service in April 1954.

5000|$|Alaska {{also used}} eight Boeing 737-200 Combi/QCs {{to suit the}} unique needs of flying in the state of Alaska. These {{aircraft}} were valued for their ability to be rapidly reconfigured (hence the moniker QC or [...] "Quick Change") to match the specific cargo and passenger loads for any given flight. In the <b>all-freight</b> configuration, the 737-200 Combis carried up to six cargo containers, known as [...] "igloos." [...] The palletized floor allowed for passenger seating to range from 26 to 72 seats. The 737-200s were also gravel-kitted, which allowed them to be used at airports such as Red Dog, which formerly featured a gravel runway. Alaska replaced the 737-200s with six reconfigured 737-400s between 2006 and 2007. Five feature a mixed cargo/passenger [...] "Combi" [...] arrangement, and one is a [...] "freighter" [...] carrying only cargo. Unlike the 737-200 Combi, the 737-400 Combis feature a fixed seating capacity of 72 seats. The last 737-200 Combi (short for combination) was retired in 2007 and is now displayed at the Alaska Aviation Museum.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the Asian, European, North American and Middle East air freight networks of combination passenger and freight and <b>all-freight</b> carriers using air freight capacity datasets {{for the period}} 1999 - 2009. The chapter begins by reviewing {{some of the key}} trends that have shaped and characterised air freight markets during the 1990 s and 2000 s. The impact of air transport market liberalisation is identified as a key determinant of changing carrier behaviour, particularly in relation to network structure organisation. The second major section of the chapter {{examines the}} sources of data available for tracking trends in the air freight sector. The lack of comprehensive datasets detailing the activities of the integrated carriers is discussed. Using the Official Airline Guide (OAG) historical databases that list ex-post carrier schedules for each year globally, annual data series indicating freight capacity of all Asian, European and North American and selected Middle Eastern carriers are determined and the general trends are described. The US T- 100 Database is used to derive an equivalent distribution for the two largest integrated carriers, FedEx and UPS. The changing nature of industry organisation is discussed and the key players in each region are distinguished. For the combination carriers, passenger and freight network structures are compared for the period 1999 - 2009. The fortunes of the key air freight hubs are reviewed over the same period. The chapter concludes with a discussion about the key driving factors in dictating the future direction of the industry in the coming decade. Consolidation in the airline industry {{and the role of the}} integrated carriers receive particular consideration.
