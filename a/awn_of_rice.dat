40|$|The {{mendelian}} inheritance <b>of</b> <b>awns,</b> and, {{the effect that}} presence or absence <b>of</b> <b>awns</b> may have on yield have been the subjects of much investigation and discussion. The conclusions from these studies have been contradictory {{to such a degree}} that further work along these same lines seems justified. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to add something to the genetics <b>of</b> <b>awn</b> inheritance and if possible to determine the possible relation between length <b>of</b> <b>awns</b> and yield. Four crosses, Kanred-Minhardi, Minhardi-Minturki, Turkey-Minhardi and Buffum-Minturki have been used in correlation studies to determine the effect of presence or absence <b>of</b> <b>awns,</b> or length <b>of</b> <b>awn</b> may have on characters indicative of yield.

50|$|The <b>awns</b> <b>of</b> {{wild emmer}} wheat spikelets {{effectively}} self-cultivate by propelling themselves mechanically into soils. During {{a period of}} increased humidity during the night, the <b>awns</b> <b>of</b> the spikelet become erect and draw together, {{and in the process}} push the grain into the soil. During the daytime the humidity drops and the awns slacken back again; however, fine silica hairs on the awns act as ratchet hooks in the soil and prevent the spikelets from reversing back out again. During the course of alternating stages of daytime and nighttime humidity, the awns' pumping movements, which resemble a swimming frog kick, drill the spikelet as much as an inch into the soil.|$|R

Some characters which were thought at first to be simple in inheritance have since been found to be rather complex. The data in the following pages are the results of an investigation made to study the inheritance <b>of</b> <b>awns</b> in a cross between Hard Federation and Kota varieties of wheat. Until the last few years awn inheritance in wheat has been regarded as extremely simple, that is, as being dependent on a single factor difference. The <b>awns</b> <b>of</b> the F 1 plants have nearly always been intermediate in length between the <b>awns</b> <b>of</b> the two parents with the F 2 ratios 3 : 1 or 1 : 2 : 1, awnlessness usually being regarded as dominant. Recently, however, it has become apparent that the inheritance <b>of</b> <b>awns</b> is much more complex than the original data indicated. Several workers have found two independent factors and one has found two factors segregating in such a fashion as strongly to suggest linkage between these two factors...|$|R

No evidence of transgressive reaction for greater resistance was shown. The results indicate that the method of floral inoculation used was not altogether satisfactory.
