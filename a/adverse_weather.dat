5|$|Apart from habitat {{destruction}} and deliberate, targeted persecution, pelicans {{are vulnerable to}} disturbance at their breeding colonies by birdwatchers, photographers and other curious visitors.

40|$|<b>Adverse</b> space <b>weather</b> affects {{operational}} activities in aviation and satellite systems. For example, large solar flares create highly variable enhanced neutral atmosphere and ionosphere electron density regions. These regions impact aviation communication frequencies {{as well as}} precision orbit determination. The natural space environment, with its dynamic space weather variability, is additionally changed by human activity. The increase in orbital debris in low Earth orbit (LEO), combined with lower atmosphere CO 2 that rises into the lower thermosphere and causes increased cooling that results in increased debris lifetime, adds to the environmental hazards of navigating in near-Earth space. This is {{at a time when}} commercial space endeavors are posed to begin more missions to LEO during the rise of the solar activity cycle toward the next maximum (2012). For satellite and aviation operators, <b>adverse</b> space <b>weather</b> results in greater expenses for orbit management, more communication outages or aviation and ground-based high frequency radio used, and an inability to effectively plan missions or service customers with space-based communication, imagery, and data transferal during time-critical activities.

5|$|<b>Adverse</b> <b>weather</b> {{such as a}} storm or hail could devastate crop {{fields and}} orchards, and thus {{jeopardize}} the livelihood of farmers in the affected area. A role of zduhaći, according to folk tradition, was to lead storms and hail clouds away from their family estates, villages, or regions, to save their crops. A zduhać could take the storms and hail clouds over the territory of another zduhać to destroy its crops. The other zduhać would fly up to confront the bringer of bad weather, {{and there would be}} a fight between the zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. In intensive systems, cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, with some farmers using beak trimming as a preventative measure.

5|$|Coker {{was awarded}} the Navy Commendation Medal for his actions {{as part of a}} coordinated 23-aircraft attack on {{petroleum}} storage tanks in Hai Phong on August 2, 1966, consisting of four waves of A-6 Intruders and A-4 Skyhawks, firing a combination of 750 and 1,000 pound bombs and rockets. The attack was the third in a series of attacks on North Vietnamese oil storage depots dating back to June. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, Coker provided accurate guidance to the pilot on airspeed, altitude and dive angle, while operating both the attack navigation radar system and electronic countermeasures.

5|$|One {{experimental}} two-seat A-10 Night <b>Adverse</b> <b>Weather</b> (N/AW) {{version was}} built by converting an A-10A. The N/AW was developed by Fairchild from the first Demonstration Testing and Evaluation (DT) A-10 for consideration by the USAF. It included a second seat for a weapons system officer responsible for electronic countermeasures (ECM), navigation and target acquisition. The N/AW version did not interest the USAF or export customers. The two-seat trainer version was ordered by the Air Force in 1981, but funding was canceled by U.S. Congress and the jet was not produced. The only two-seat A-10 built now resides at Edwards Air Force Base's Flight Test Center Museum.|$|E

40|$|Modern laser sources {{nowadays}} deliver ultrashort light pulses reaching few cycles in duration, high energies {{beyond the}} Joule level and peak powers exceeding several terawatt (TW). When such pulses propagate through optically-transparent media, they first self-focus {{in space and}} grow in intensity, until they generate a tenuous plasma by photo-ionization. For free electron densities and beam intensities below their breakdown limits, these pulses evolve as self-guided objects, resulting from successive equilibria between the Kerr focusing process, the chromatic dispersion of the medium, and the defocusing action of the electron plasma. Discovered one decade ago, this self-channeling mechanism reveals a new physics, widely extending the frontiers of nonlinear optics. Implications include long-distance propagation of TW beams in the atmosphere, supercontinuum emission, pulse shortening as well as high-order harmonic generation. This review presents the landmarks of the 10 -odd-year progress in this field. Particular emphasis is laid to the theoretical modeling of the propagation equations, whose physical ingredients are discussed from numerical simulations. Differences between femtosecond pulses propagating in gaseous or condensed materials are underlined. Attention is also paid to the multifilamentation instability of broad, powerful beams, breaking up the energy distribution into small-scale cells along the optical path. The robustness of the resulting filaments in <b>adverse</b> <b>weathers,</b> their large conical emission exploited for multipollutant remote sensing, nonlinear spectroscopy, and the possibility to guide electric discharges in air are finally addressed {{on the basis of}} experimental results.

5|$|The Hunter F.1 entered {{service with}} the Royal Air Force in July 1954. It {{was the first}} {{high-speed}} jet aircraft equipped with radar and fully powered flight controls to go into widespread service with the RAF. The Hunter replaced the Gloster Meteor, the Canadair Sabre, and the de Havilland Venom jet fighters in service. Initially, low internal fuel capacity restricted the Hunter's performance, giving it only a maximum flight endurance of about an hour. A tragic incident occurred on 8 February 1956, when a flight of eight Hunters was redirected to another airfield owing to <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> conditions. Six of the eight aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed, killing one pilot.|$|E

5|$|After {{the loss}} of G-ALYV, the Central Government of India convened a court of inquiry to examine {{the cause of the}} accident. Professor Natesan Srinivasan joined the inquiry as the main {{technical}} expert. A large portion of the aircraft was recovered and reassembled at Farnborough, during which the break-up was found to have begun with a left elevator spar failure in the stabilizer. The inquiry concluded that the aircraft had encountered extreme negative G forces during takeoff; severe turbulence generated by <b>adverse</b> <b>weather</b> was determined to have induced down-loading, leading to {{the loss of}} the wings. Examination of the cockpit controls suggested that the pilot may have inadvertently over-stressed the aircraft when pulling out of a steep dive by over-manipulation of the fully powered flight controls. Investigators did not consider metal fatigue as a contributory cause.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was is to measure motions and {{accelerations}} that a vessel, during <b>adverse</b> sea <b>weather</b> conditions, suffers and produces on the subjects on board, in order to evaluate the effects on their loss of balance. A distinctive and innovative aspect {{of the study was}} to have based the research not on a simulation, for example through the use of a mechanized platform and manikins, but to have chosen a real measurement through the use of electronic instruments, partly designed for this purpose, suitable for measuring motions and accelerations of the vessel, and contemporaneously the acceleration suffered by a subject on board and free to move. The survey of the vessel acceleration and that felt by the person was carried out respectively through an inertial gyroscopic platform and a wireless triaxial accelerometer provided with MEMS sensors. This method, which provides the possibility of monitoring the vessel over a long time (a whole season) and during <b>adverse</b> sea <b>weather</b> conditions, allowed us to obtain a complete and valid data base formed by the combined action of the boat (accelerations and motions) and the system of forces felt by the subjects on board. This system of forces is the one mainly responsible for the physical stress and loss of balance in the sailor, so we can understand how this combined method of measurement, and true of the vessel motions and accelerations suffered by the worker’s body, since it allows us to identify the limit conditions which lead to loss of balance, can be used in the arrangement of measures, to guarantee the safety of the sailo...|$|R
