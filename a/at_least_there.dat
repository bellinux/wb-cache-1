Many later composers and performers, including Johannes Brahms, Ferruccio Busoni and Gabriel Fauré, have composed their own. Uniquely among Mozart's concertos, the score does not direct the soloist to end the cadenza with a cadential trill. The omission of the customary trill is likely to have been deliberate, with Mozart choosing to have the cadenza connect directly to the coda without one.|$|E

25|$|At the Holy Apostles (6th century) five domes {{were applied}} to a {{cruciform}} plan; the central dome was the highest. After the 6th century there were no churches built which in any way competed in scale with these great works of Justinian, and the plans more or less tended to approximate to one type. The central area covered by the dome was included in a considerably larger square, of which the four divisions, to the east, west, north and south, were carried up higher in the vaulting and roof system than the four corners, forming in this way a sort of nave and transepts. Sometimes the central space was square, sometimes octagonal, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>there</b> were eight piers supporting the dome instead of four, and the nave and transepts were narrower in proportion.|$|E
25|$|In principle, the Life {{field is}} infinite, but {{computers}} have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches {{on the border}} of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program, but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a toroidal array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>there</b> are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns.|$|E

[...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called the video [...] "campy", while describing it as a [...] "cautionery tale" [...] comparable with the singer's cancelled video for 2003 single, [...] "American Life".

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode 7.7 out of 10, praising the plot and the {{introduction}} of Hall/Graviton, but criticizing the amount of humor and MCU references.

He praised the character development, specifically for Coulson and Skye, {{and the introduction}} of Hall/Graviton, but criticized Quinn as [...] "barely a step above a generic Miami Vice villain and whose motives would be totally uninteresting if they were ever made clear to us". He also found Dalton to be [...] "the latest in a line of dull Whedon hunks with just a glimmer of personality." [...] The Guardians Graeme Virtue felt that [...] "If Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. hasn't been levitating your boat so far, this breezy episode probably didn't do that much to change your mind. If you're not in the mood, the endless quipping can seem exhausting, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>there</b> was some incremental character development."

500|$|Conversely, Stephen Whitty of the New York Daily News said, [...] "Although it's called Captain America: Civil War, {{the latest}} Marvel movie is {{actually}} a supersized Avengers picture—overstuffed to bursting.

[...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "As a work of thought, Civil War is compromised, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>there</b> are thoughts to compromise. As an action film, it has its moments, but aside from the big opening sequence—the action scenes are a bit flat." [...] Andrew O'Hehir writing for Salon said, [...] "Much of Captain America: Civil War is just the laborious working-out of leftover dangling plot elements from Captain America: The Winter Soldier two summers ago." [...] While Nicholas Barber of BBC gave the film a generally favorable review, praising both its visuals and action sequences, he criticized {{the fact that there was}} [...] "no cogent reason for any of [...] to be on one side or the other, which is why their inevitable dust-up feels like a game of dodgeball in a school playground." [...] Mark Millar, writer of the [...] "Civil War" [...] comic storyline on which the film was based, felt the film [...] "had a good opening twenty , but then I honestly can’t remember what the movie was about."

500|$|MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan {{summarized}} the episode as follows: [...] "When all {{was said and}} done, it was another tribute episode, something that can't be uttered by a Glee fan without a sigh and an eye roll." [...] Bell noted that tribute episodes usually mean that [...] "all sense of plot continuity" [...] is forgone, but that this one ranked [...] "at the top {{of all of the}} other Glee tribute episodes because even though it was absurd at times, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>there</b> was a plot—and it kind of made sense". Futterman was more complimentary and described it as the [...] "most effortless tribute episode yet", and Canning wrote that [...] "with songs we know and love and storylines that actually connected and delivered some meaningful and moving moments" [...] it was [...] "more than just a theme episode". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post, however, thought that it was very much like previous tributes in that it also [...] "featured scattered plot lines engineered to include as many songs by said artists as possible" [...] and also [...] "glorified their respective pop stars’ images to an absurd degree". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff also noted the glorification of Jackson, and noted [...] "every time the show turns into an episode about Michael Jackson, it stops dead in its tracks entirely". He stated that what was [...] "weird" [...] about the episode was that [...] "what didn’t work was the spectacle, while what did work were the smaller, character-based stories" [...] which [...] "provided a spine some of the other spectacle-oriented episodes have lacked". Futterman was one of many reviewers who took note of a new feature of this tribute episode when she commented on the [...] "initial whiff of product placement and forced timing" [...] related to the [...] "Immortal World Tour" [...] dialogue. Rae Votta of Billboard thought the inclusion a [...] "brilliant bit of marketing synergy", but TVLine Michael Slezak called it [...] "ridiculously unsubtle product-placement".|$|E
500|$|... "TS-19" [...] {{garnered}} favorable {{reviews from}} most television critics. In his 8.5 out of 10 rating review, Eric Goldman of IGN {{wrote that the}} episode was an exceptional showing for the series, adding that it told [...] "a compelling, intense story within its hour" [...] albeit averting from the comics. As Michelle Kung of The Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "The first season of The Walking Dead doesn’t exactly end on an optimistic note, but our heroes are left driving into the unknown after escaping certain death at the CDC." [...] Kurt Christenson of New York Daily News analyzed that [...] "almost and everyone's still kind of in the dark", and Kelly stated that [...] "TS-19" [...] came to an [...] "abrupt, explosive end". Salon journalist Simon Abrams concluded that the frenetic pace of The Walking Dead was relatable, while Paste television commentator Josh Jackson was keen of the character development in the episode {{as well as the}} varying political themes covered; [...] "After six episodes, the characters are worth caring about. Despite occasional stilted monologues, quick tempers and unfortunate stereotypes, the few living souls in The Walking Dead are a bigger draw than the undead. The show has spent more time on topics like marriage, parenthood, unfaithfulness, loss, domestic violence, gender roles, small-scale politics, loyalty, kindness than it has with kill shots. By filling the world with zombies, Frank Darabont is able to explore the human condition under extreme circumstances." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Dan Snierson was entertained by [...] "TS-19", and asserted that the conclusion [...] "resonated over images of Rick & Co. U-turning into the great unknown, we got the sense that {{as long as they were}} alive, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>there</b> was a chance of a tomorrow." [...] Writing for the same publication, Jeff Jensen was intrigued at how producers approached the themes of the comics, and later noted that it was proof that they were using the comics as a route for thematic inspiration in lieu of a literal interpretation. For Los Angeles Times Gina McIntyre, [...] "Tonight's finale [...] did yield much insight, though, into the nature of the plague itself, in relative terms anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune praised Rick Heinrichs's {{production}} design and Jim Carrey {{for having a}} balanced performance as a scene stealer. Elder called the film [...] "exceptionally clever, hilariously gloomy and bitingly subversive." [...] Desson Thomson from The Washington Post reasoned over a fellow film-goer's characterization of Count Olaf, [...] "Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur." [...] Ty Burr, writing in The Boston Globe, observed, [...] "Director Brad Silberling has essentially made a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain. At the same time, Silberling's not a hack like Chris Columbus, and Snicket has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two Harry Potter films. The film's no masterpiece, but at least you're {{in the hands of}} people who know what they're doing. The movie, like the books, flatters children's innate sense that the world is not a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying to sell you something. How you deal with the cognitive dissonance of a $125 million Hollywood picture telling you this is up to you. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>there</b> are no Lemony Snicket Happy Meals. Yet." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli felt that [...] "the film is first and foremost a fantasy, but there are dark currents running just beneath the surface. I give Silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events manages to remain witty throughout." [...] Roger Ebert gave a mixed review: [...] "Jim Carrey is over the top as Count Olaf, but I suppose a character named Count Olaf is over the top by definition. I liked the film, but I'll tell you what. I think this one is a tune-up for the series, a trial run in which they figure out what works and what needs to be tweaked. The original Spider-Man was a disappointment, but the same team came back and made Spider-Man 2, the best superhero movie ever made." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety gave a negative review, criticizing the filmmakers for sacrificing the storyline in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography. He wrote, [...] "A Series of Unfortunate Events suggests what Mary Poppins might have looked like had Tim Burton directed it. Not surprisingly, Burton's longtime {{production design}}er Rick Heinrichs was responsible for the sets, while ace Emmanuel Lubezki (Burton's Sleepy Hollow) contributed the expressionistic lighting schemes." ...|$|E
