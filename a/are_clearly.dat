5|$|Bathhouses are {{not always}} {{identifiable}} as such from the outside. Some bathhouses <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> marked and well lit, others have no marking other than a street address on the door. Bathhouses sometimes display the rainbow flag, which is commonly flown by businesses to identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the gay press and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media. In 2003 Australia began airing possibly the world's first television advertisements for a gay bathhouse when advertisements on commercial television in Melbourne promoted Wet on Wellington, a sauna in Wellington Street, Collingwood.|$|E
5|$|Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> visible by {{microscopy}} in {{brains of}} those afflicted by AD. Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau {{which has become}} hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles {{as a consequence of}} ageing, the brains of people with AD have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe. Lewy bodies are not rare in the brains of people with AD.|$|E

Moreover, honeyeaters have been observed moving {{from tree to tree}} with significant loads of B.sessilis pollen on their foreheads, beaks and throats, having acquired it by brushing against pollen presenters while foraging for nectar; experiments have shown that some of this pollen may be subsequently deposited on stigmas during later foraging.|$|E

Seyfert galaxies account for about 10% of all galaxies.

5|$|The style {{continued}} to be popular in Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, where it was frequently employed {{in the design of}} public and municipal buildings. From {{the latter half of the}} 19th century it was rivalled by the Gothic revival in the English-speaking world, whose champions, such as Augustus Pugin, remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples, deemed it too pagan for Anglican and Anglo-Catholic worship. However, as an architectural style it has {{continued to}} be popular and to evolve; its pediments, symmetry and proportions <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> evident in the design of many modern buildings today.|$|E
5|$|While it {{has been}} argued that the damage {{attributed}} to this storm may have been caused by an earthquake following the Thera Eruption, it has also been suggested that it was caused during a war with the Hyksos, and the storm reference is merely a metaphor for chaos upon which the Pharaoh was attempting to impose order.

5|$|While the EU's {{system of}} {{governance}} is largely unique, elements {{can be compared to}} other models. One general observation {{on the nature of the}} distribution of powers would be that the EU resembles the federalism of Germany. There, powers are predominantly shared (states can exercise federal powers where the federation has not already exercised them) between the levels of government, and the states participate strongly with decision making at the federal level. This is in contrast with other federations, for example the United States, where powers <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> divided between the levels of government, and the states have little say in federal decision making.|$|E

5|$|Akodon caenosus is the {{smallest}} of the Argentine members of the A.boliviensis group–indeed, among {{the smallest}} of all species of Akodon. The upperparts are uniformly colored, but their tone is variable: generally ochraceous brown, but approaching yellow, red, or olivaceous in some individuals. Reddish tones occur mostly in lactating females. High-altitude animals are generally lighter, but there is also conspicuous variation within populations. The ears are similar to the upperparts, but some individuals have the sides more rich and clear in color. The underparts <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> different in color, varying from light gray to yellowish or reddish. There are yellowish rings around the eyes, which are more highly developed in high-altitude populations. There are white to yellowish hairs on the fore- and hindfeet. The tail is variably covered with hair and is dark brown above and white to buffy below.|$|E
5|$|An Indian Mughal {{painting}} rediscovered in St. Petersburg in the 1950s shows a dodo {{along with}} native Indian birds. It depicts a slimmer, brownish bird, and its discoverer A.

It is believed to be from the 17th century and has been attributed to artist Ustad Mansur. The bird depicted probably lived in the menagerie of Mughal Emperor Jahangir, located in Surat, where English traveller Peter Mundy also claimed to have seen dodos. In 2014, another Indian illustration of a dodo was reported, but it was found to be derivative of an 1836 German illustration.|$|E
