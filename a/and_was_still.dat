5|$|Dyer {{took his}} role as a {{physical}} culture expert very seriously and insisted on managing the diet of his boxers. He was also at the forefront of a fad in the mid-1920s which was based on a diet of fruit and vegetable drinks, a lifestyle choice that he believed could cure all illnesses. Dyer continued in his career as a physical culture expert into the next decade <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> working out of London in that capacity in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Emerald {{was still}} {{serving on the}} Home Station on 11 April 1811 when she sent into Cork a French privateer. This was the 18-gun Auguste (or Augusta), which had been taken on 6 April. Nearly a month later, on 5 July, Emerald left Madeira {{in the company of}} five East Indiamen <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> on convoy duties later that month when a {{transport}} ship spotted her escorting thirteen vessels off the coast of West Africa on 18 July.|$|E

5|$|Relations between Argentina and Uruguay worsened, {{and both}} nations {{came close to}} declaring war on each other, {{although}} neither could afford a direct military conflict. Argentina had only recently emerged from a long civil war, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> struggling to suppress a Federalist rebellion in its western province of La Rioja. Uruguay was too weak militarily {{to engage in a}} fight unaided.|$|E
5|$|The CSBS and the {{improved}} version, the Mk. X were insufficient, as both were {{too large to}} easily stabilize. Because {{of the way it}} was built, the Automatic Bomb Sight could be equipped with a stabilizer but it was estimated that it would be some time before it could be modified and brought into production. The Norden did offer stabilization but it also required relatively long setup times <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> not available for purchase.|$|E

One hundred years after its opening, the 1917-built, 1925-expanded original United States National Bank Building continues to serve as the main branch of U.S. Bank in Portland in 2017.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Yamashita, who had retreated into the mountains of central and northern Luzon. Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> holding out at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a hard time believing that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) came down from the mountains to surrender with some 100,000 of his men.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{returned}} to Brunswick {{after the war}} and reopened the Planters' Hoe Company in association with George T. Lane. He ended the production of augers, which still made up a small percentage of production even after closing Millville Manufacturing. Allen put himself in charge of manufacturing and sales and he again secured a solid market share in the South. A prosperous trade resumed <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> strong at least until the 1880s. The company eventually expanded and began manufacturing lighter common hoes for the general public, adding to its heavy southern-style line of hoes. The Planters' Hoe Company was still a success as late as the 1890s, but it was extinct by the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of the Yugoslav Army, the 1st Cavalry Division began mobilising on 3 April 1941, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> engaged in that process three days later when the Germans began an air {{campaign}} and a series of preliminary operations against the Yugoslav frontiers. By the end of the following day, the division's cavalry brigade headquarters and all of the division's cavalry regiments had been detached for duty with other formations of the 1st Army Group. The divisional headquarters and divisional-level units remained in the vicinity of Zagreb until 10 April, when they were given orders to establish a defensive line southeast of Zagreb along the Sava river, with infantry and artillery support. The division had only begun to deploy for this task when the German 14th Panzer Division captured Zagreb. The divisional headquarters and all attached units were then disarmed by armed Croat fifth column groups, or surrendered to German troops.|$|E
5|$|Another feud {{was over}} the WWE Intercontinental Championship between the {{defending}} champion Drew McIntyre and Kofi Kingston. SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long stripped McIntyre of the championship and fired him for repeatedly attacking Matt Hardy. Long set up a tournament to determine the new champion, in which Christian and Kingston qualified for the final by defeating Cody Rhodes and Dolph Ziggler. The following week, on the May 14 episode of SmackDown, Kingston defeated Christian to win the tournament and the championship. Immediately following the match, however, McIntyre presented Long with {{a letter from the}} WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, which stated that McIntyre had been reinstated to the roster <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> recognized as the Intercontinental Champion. As a result, WWE's official website announced that McIntyre would defend the championship against tournament winner Kingston.|$|E
5|$|As a {{traveller}} {{he visited}} Scotland {{and many other}} parts of Britain and wrote about them. Many of his travels took him to places that were little known to the British public and the travelogues he produced, accompanied by painted and engraved colour plates, were much appreciated. Each tour started at his home and related in detail the route, the scenery, the habits and activities of the people he met, their customs and superstitions and the wildlife he saw or heard about. He travelled on horseback accompanied by his servant, Moses Griffiths, who sketched the things they encountered, later to work these up into illustrations for the books. He was an amiable man with a large circle of friends <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> busily following his interests into his sixties. He enjoyed good health throughout his life and died at Downing at the age of seventy two.|$|E

5|$|Caliph Walid quickly re-confirmed Qutayba as governor, {{and even}} made his {{province}} independent {{from the governor}} of Iraq, but Qutayba's position was not secure: the Arab army was tired of constant campaigning <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> riven by factional rivalries, while Qutayba himself had alienated the most powerful Arab tribal groups. He was generally popular among the native Iranians, but {{the leader of the}} native auxiliaries, Hayyan an-Nabati, had secretly turned against him. Qutayba was completely unaware of the situation however, and began preparations for the campaign of 715, during which he intended to finally capture the Ferghana Valley and complete the subjugation of the Jaxartes valley. His only concern was that his old rival, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, might be restored to the Caliph's favour after al-Hajjaj's death, and he took few precautions except for removing his family and belongings from Merv to Shash and placing a guard on the Oxus.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, {{aeronautical}} designers {{looked to}} variable-geometry wing designs {{to gain the}} manoeuvrability and efficient cruise of straight wings {{with the speed of}} swept wing designs. The United Kingdom had cancelled the procurement of the TSR-2 and subsequent F-111K aircraft, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> looking for a replacement for its Avro Vulcan and Blackburn Buccaneer strike aircraft. Britain and France had initiated the AFVG (Anglo French Variable Geometry) project in 1965, but this had ended with French withdrawal in 1967. Britain continued to develop a variable-geometry aircraft similar to the proposed AFVG, and sought new partners to achieve this.|$|E
5|$|Faced with stiff {{competition}} and {{an inability to}} increase its own capacity, Rogers Locomotive Works was purchased by ALCO in 1905. Rogers' last independently built locomotive was serial number 6271, a 0-6-0 tank locomotive built for W. R. Grace & Company in February 1905. ALCO continued building locomotives at the Rogers plant until 1913 when manufacturing at the plant ceased permanently. Locomotives built at the Rogers plant under ALCO are generally referred to as locomotives built by ALCO-Rogers. ALCO used the Rogers plant buildings as warehouses well into the 1920s, but eventually sold off all of the property. The original Rogers erecting shop was converted into office space <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in use in that manner as late as 1992.|$|E
