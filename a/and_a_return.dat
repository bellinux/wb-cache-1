5|$|During his presidency, Endara {{abolished}} the Panamanian military {{and replaced it}} with a national police force.

5|$|According to e-mails {{released}} in the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, Millionaire narrowly avoided cancellation after the 2014–15 season. The show's declining ratings prompted DADT to demand a dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal, which SPE was hesitant to accept. The series was nonetheless renewed for the 2015–16 season, with various cuts to the show's production budget <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> to the original format (but with only 14 questions). Had the show not been renewed, SPE would have placed the show on extended hiatus for three years, reclaimed full rights to the show (without the innovations and format added in the syndicated run, to which DADT owns intellectual property rights), and shopped the revived show to another network or syndicator. In January 2017, {{it was announced that}} Millionaire has been renewed through 2018.|$|E
5|$|By 5 May 1536, {{the town}} council of Buena Esperanza had now lost all faith in Cerezeda and {{voted for the}} {{abandonment}} of Higueras <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> to Trujillo; Cerezeda opposed this decision, but the council forced him {{to sign off on}} the move. In the meantime, any party foraging outside of Buena Esperanza was ordered to consist of at least 20 members for defence from the hostile natives. A chaotic evacuation back to Trujillo began, and resentment against Cerezeda was such that he feared for his life and fled to Naco to seek refuge amongst friendly natives there. On 9 May, amidst this disordered Spanish retreat, García de Celís returned from Guatemala with news that help would soon be forthcoming.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} XXXVI Corps had reached total exhaustion. With the {{transfer}} of the SS Division Nord to the south, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> of the Finnish 6th Division to III Corps, Feige deemed any further advance in this sector impossible. With the Soviets bringing more reinforcements to the front every day, Feige requested more men if he was to start a new attack. Plans were made by AOK Norwegen for a resumption of the offensive, but the German High Command was unable to reinforce the Arctic theatre with additional units and AOK Norwegen could not send anything meaningful itself to aid Feige. Consequently, all offensive plans were scrapped. Due to the more spectacular gains at the main front in Central Russia during Operation Barbarossa, the OKW deemed the current situation acceptable and an end was ordered to the offensive operations of XXXVI Corps. This, combined with heavy German casualties, led to the attack finally being called off at the end of September.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} two years of the club's existence, the players {{organised}} matches among themselves at Snaresbrook near Epping Forest, probably on a part of Epping Forest between the Infant Orphan Asylum and Forest Place. Forest's first match against another club took place on 15 March 1862, and resulted in a victory over Crystal Palace (not the modern club of the same name). Both this match, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> fixture between the two teams the following month, involved fifteen players on each team. At the time, the rules of association football had not been codified, and many variants existed, differing in the number of players per team, whether players were permitted to play the ball with their hands, or the method of scoring goals. In 1863 the Forest club was among the founder members of The Football Association (the FA) and adopted the rules set down by that body, although they continued to play occasional matches under other sets of rules against clubs not affiliated to the FA.|$|E
5|$|From 3 June 1984, the {{day train}} {{was moved to}} run via Drammen. Until 1989, the Roa–Hønefoss Line had four daily round trips with a local train from Hønefoss via Roa to Oslo, {{normally}} a Class 65 or Class 67 unit. From 1989, this {{was reduced to a}} single round trip, with a morning train from Hønefoss to Oslo <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> in the afternoon. Eventually this was taken over by a Class 69 unit and by the late 1990s taken out of service. The Roa–Hønefoss Line remains a pure freight track for long-haul freight trains on the Bergen Line. After the opening of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station in 1989, passenger trains run via Drammen; however, the Roa–Hønefoss Line is used as a reserve line for passenger trains when the Drammen Line or Randsfjord Line is out of service.|$|E
5|$|Serving as Secretary of the Treasury in the {{administration}} of Rutherford B. Hayes, Sherman continued his efforts for financial stability and solvency, overseeing an end to wartime inflationary measures <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> to gold-backed money. He returned to the Senate after his term expired, serving there for a further sixteen years. During that time he continued his work on financial legislation, as well as writing and debating laws on immigration, business competition law, and the regulation of interstate commerce. Sherman was the principal author of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which was signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison. In 1897, President William McKinley appointed him Secretary of State. Failing health and declining faculties made him unable to handle the burdens of the job, and he retired in 1898 {{at the start of the}} Spanish–American War. Sherman died at his home in Washington, D.C. in 1900.|$|E

5|$|The Cheltenham Festival {{took place}} the {{following}} week with two matches on the College Ground: against Sussex starting on Monday, 19 August; <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> against Yorkshire starting on Thursday, 22 August. Gloucestershire made short work of Sussex, winning by an innings and 24 runs {{in less than two}} days. Grace made only 2 of Gloucestershire's total of 198 but he was again outstanding with the ball and took 13 wickets in the match (6–18 and 7–88). The Yorkshire match was drawn after being ruined by the weather. Yorkshire had claimed a first innings lead after Grace was yet again dismissed by Tom Emmett, this time for 10, but he compensated by having taken 6–77 to restrict the Yorkshire lead to 39. He captured a further two wickets in the second innings before the match was washed out.|$|E
5|$|The Third Division {{championship}} was {{won in the}} 1965–66 {{season and}} Hull remained in the Second Division for 12 years before relegation in 1978. Hull reached the semi-final of the Watney Cup in the tournament's inaugural staging in 1970, where they were beaten by Manchester United in a penalty shoot-out; {{this was the first}} game in English football to be decided by this method. The Final of this competition was reached in 1974, where Hull were beaten by Stoke City. Relegation to the Fourth Division {{for the first time in}} the club's history came in 1981 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> to the Third Division was secured two years later in the 1982–83 season. The season after, Hull reached the final of the Associate Members' Cup in its inaugural season and were beaten by Bournemouth.
