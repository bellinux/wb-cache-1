5|$|There was a {{sense of}} closure for Grove before the {{beginning}} of the 1945 season, as he was awarded $310 ($ today) in damages for the auto accident in 1941. He held out for a new contract in the off-season, and finally signed with the White Sox <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> before {{the beginning of the season}} after becoming the last remaining holdout. Grove was the workhorse of the White Sox, leading the team in games pitched (33) and started (30), while remaining the youngest pitcher on the roster. He finished the season with 217 pitched innings, a career best four shutouts, a 14–12 record, and a 3.44 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{went through}} knee surgery during the offseason, {{but there was}} still concern about whether he had a future in the NFL. That was set aside when he was {{considered}} to be progressing well in his recovery as of early July 1977. During the Buccaneers' offseason, the quarterbacks on the roster changed entirely, with Dickinson being the only holdover; Gary Huff was now the starter, and Dickinson was fighting for a backup role alongside Mike Boryla and Randy Hedberg. After the Buccaneers lost Boryla and Huff to injuries, the former for the season, Dickinson ended up being the starting quarterback for the team's final preseason game against the Bills. In the game, Dickinson completed 2 of 12 passes for -2yards and was sacked three times in a 176 loss. A week after the game against the Bills, Dickinson was released by the Buccaneers along with four other players. The Buccaneers re-signed him after Huff got injured in late October, but Dickinson was again released <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> later.|$|E
5|$|The Mighty Ducks {{returned}} Getzlaf to the Hitmen for the 2003–04 season. He recorded 75 {{points in}} just 49 games {{and was named}} to the WHL's first all-star team. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lock-out, Getzlaf was again returned to Calgary for his fourth season of junior hockey. He was named team captain, but was briefly stripped of the title by the coaches after earning several misconduct penalties for arguing with the officials. The captaincy was restored after <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>weeks,</b> and Getzlaf moderated his interactions with referees. He also missed time during the season after suffering a concussion {{as a result of a}} hit by Dion Phaneuf of the Red Deer Rebels. Getzlaf finished the regular season with 54 points in 51 games, and after the Hitmen were eliminated from the WHL playoffs, was assigned to the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks of the American Hockey League (AHL) for their own playoff run. Getzlaf appeared in 10 post-season games for Cincinnati in his professional debut. He recorded one goal and four assists.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} viticultural hazards in the Muscadet region is {{winter and spring}} time frost and threat of mildew near harvest. The Melon de Bourgogne has adapted well to these {{condition}} being very frost resistant and capable of ripening early. Harvest usually takes place in mid to late September {{but in recent years}} producers have been experimented with harvesting the grapes several days to <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> later. The traditional method is to harvest early in order to maintain acidity that is a key characteristic of Muscadet wine. The trend to pick later, and risk the threat of rains and mildew rot, is to give the grapes more time to develop sugars and riper phenols that can impart more fruit notes and complexity to the wine. However, these grapes that are picked later will usually experience a dramatic drop in acidity.|$|E

25|$|A {{higher than}} average {{concentration}} of hagwon in the Gangnam-gu (강남구) area, specifically Daechi-dong (대치동), has been cited as {{the primary reason for}} an increase in real estate costs in the area. In the 1970s the Seoul government made some top schools relocate to the area; however, the schools there have become associated with entry into elite high schools and then elite universities. Many residents feel their children need to be associated with these schools in order to reach the upper levels of business and success. As more parents try to move to the area to allow their children to attend these schools, the prices of real estate in the area have risen to 300percent of similar areas in Seoul. In 2003 the government had planned to develop a hagwon center in Pangyo to relieve some of the pressure on Gangnam, yet after heavy criticism for only shifting the problem around and not solving it, the government canceled the plan only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> later.|$|E
