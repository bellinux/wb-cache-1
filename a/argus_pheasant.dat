500|$|Edward Bagnall Poulton's {{strongly}} Darwinian 1890 book The Colours of Animals, {{their meaning}} and use, especially {{considered in the}} case of insects argued the case for three aspects of animal coloration that are broadly accepted today but were controversial or wholly new at the time. It strongly supported Darwin's theory of sexual selection, arguing that the obvious differences between male and female birds such as the <b>Argus</b> <b>pheasant</b> were selected by the females, pointing out that bright male plumage was found only in species [...] "which court by day". The book introduced the concept of frequency-dependent selection, as when edible mimics are less frequent than the distasteful models whose colours and patterns they copy. In the book, Poulton also coined the term aposematism for warning coloration, which he identified in widely differing animal groups including mammals (such as the skunk), bees and wasps, beetles, and butterflies.|$|E

[...] Wood was prepared to disagree with Darwin, too, as he felt that the eyespots in its plumage were perfect and thus signs of special creation: [...] "although I feel convinced of the truth of your theory of the origin of species, <b>Argus</b> <b>pheasant's</b> plumage cannot be explained by it ...rather it seems to point to (& almost to prove) the existence of a great artistic power."

40|$|We used radiotelemetry, habitat sampling, camera trapping, and line-transect surveys {{to explore}} {{movement}} patterns, distribution, and abundance of Great <b>Argus</b> <b>Pheasants</b> (Argusianus <b>argus)</b> in Sumatra, Indonesia. We radiotracked six adult and one subadult males. Territories averaged 14. 5 ± 8. 5 ha, and home-range size did not vary by month or by relative abundance of selected plant foods. Daily travel distance (849 ± 211 m) varied significantly between months {{but did not}} reflect changes in plant foods. Territories were used almost exclusively by resident males. Males preferentially used undisturbed forest (habitat I). Vegetation structure at male display sites and random points indicated that display sites were located in undisturbed forest, with few lianas and small leaf size on trees adjacent to the display site. Between 1998 and 2001, we conducted five line-transect surveys in conjunction with camera-trap surveys. Density estimates of calling males varied from 0. 4 to 2. 5 males km− 2, and the total density estimate ranged from 0. 9 to 3. 7 birds km− 2. Density estimates increased substantially between 1998 and 2001, reflecting recovery from depressed densities after the 1997 - 1998 El Niño drought. Habitat occupancy estimates varied from 25 % to 38 % but {{were not significantly different}} over time. The proportion of occupied habitat was similar to the proportion of habitat I. We conclude that Great <b>Argus</b> <b>Pheasants</b> prefer undisturbed forest and rarely use other habitat even as population density increases.

60|$|Birds.--The late Marquis of Tweeddale made {{a special}} study of Philippine birds, and in 1873 {{published}} a catalogue in the Transactions of the Zoological Society (Vol. IX. Pt. 2, pp. 125-247). But since that date large collections {{have been made}} by Everett, Steere, and other travellers, the result of which has been to more than double the known species, and to render the ornithological fauna an exceedingly rich one. Many of the Malayan genera which were thought to be absent when the first edition of this work was published have since been discovered, among which are Phyllornis, Criniger, Diceum, Prionochilus, and Batrachostomus. But there still remain a large number of highly characteristic Malayan genera whose absence gives a distinctive feature to the Philippine bird fauna. Among these are Tiga and Meiglyptes, genera of woodpeckers; Phænicophaes and Centropus, remarkable cuckoos; the long-tailed paroquets, Palæornis; all the genera of Barbets except Xantholæma; the small but beautiful family Eurylæmidæ; many genera allied to Timalia and Ixos; the mynahs, Gracula; the long-tailed flycatchers, Tchitrea; the fire-backed <b>pheasants,</b> Euplocamus; the <b>argus</b> <b>pheasants,</b> the jungle-fowl, and many others.|$|R
40|$|The phylogenetic relationships, {{biogeography}} and classification of, and morphobehavioral (M/B) evolution in, gamebirds (Aves: Galliformes) are investigated. In-group taxa (rooted on {{representatives of}} the Anseriformes) include 158 species representing all suprageneric galliform taxa and 65 genera. The characters include 102 M/B attributes and 4452 nucleic acid base pairs from mitochondrial cytochrome b (CYT B), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND 2), 12 S ribosomal DNA (12 S) and control region (CR), and nuclear ovomucoid intron G (OVO-G). Analysis of the combined character data set yielded a single, completely resolved cladogram that had {{the highest levels of}} jackknife support, which suggests a need for a revised classification for the phasianine galliforms. Adding 102 M/B characters to the combined CYT B and ND 2 partitions (2184 characters) decisively overturns the topology suggested by analysis of the two mtDNA partitions alone, refuting the view that M/B characters should be excluded from phylogenetic analyses because of their relatively small number and putative character state ambiguity. Exclusion of the OVO-G partition (with > 70 % missing data) from the combined data set had no effect on cladistic structure, but slightly lowered jackknife support at several nodes. Exclusion of third positions of codons in an analysis of a CYT B + ND 2 partition resulted in a massive loss of resolution and support, and even failed to recover the monophyly of the Galliformes with jackknife support. A combined analysis of putatively less informative, "non-coding" characters (CYT B/ND 2 third position sites + CR + 12 S + OVO-G sequences) yielded a highly resolved consensus cladogram congruent with the combined-evidence cladogram. Traditionally recognized suprageneric galliform taxa emerging in the combined cladogram are: the families Megapodiidae (megapodes), Cracidae (cracids), Numididae (guineafowls), Odontophoridae (New World quails) and Phasianidae (pheasants, pavonines, partridges, quails, francolins, spurfowls and grouse) and the subfamilies Cracinae (curassows, chachalacas and the horned guan), Penelopinae (remaining guans), Pavoninae sensu lato (peafowls, peacock <b>pheasants</b> and <b>argus</b> <b>pheasants),</b> Tetraoninae (grouse) and Phasianinae (pheasants minus Gallus). The monophyly of some traditional groupings (e. g., the perdicinae: partridges/quails/francolins) is rejected decisively, contrasted by the emergence of other unexpected groupings. The most remarkable phylogenetic results are the placement of endemic African galliforms as sisters to geographically far-distant taxa in Asia and the Americas. Biogeographically, the combined-data cladogram supports the hypothesis that basal lineages of galliforms diverged prior to the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K-T) Event and that the subsequent cladogenesis was influenced by the break-up of Gondwana. The evolution of gamebirds in Africa, Asia and the Americas has a far more complicated historical biogeography than suggested to date. With regard to character evolution: spurs appear to have evolved at least twice within the Galliformes; a relatively large number of tail feathers (≥ 14) at least three times; polygyny at least twice; and sexual dimorphism many times...|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless I {{know of no}} fact {{in natural}} history more {{wonderful}} than that the female <b>Argus</b> <b>pheasant</b> should appreciate the exquisite shading of the ball-and-socket ornaments and the elegant patterns on the wing-feather of the male. He who thinks that the male was created as he now exists must admit that the great plumes, which prevent the wings from being used for flight, and which are displayed during courtship and at no other time in a manner quite peculiar to this one species, were given to him as an ornament. If so, he must likewise admit that the female was created and endowed with the capacity of appreciating such ornaments. I differ only in {{the conviction that the}} male <b>Argus</b> <b>pheasant</b> acquired his beauty gradually, through the preference of the females during many generations for the more highly ornamented males; the aesthetic capacity of the females having been advanced through exercise or habit, just as our own taste is gradually improved.

60|$|The {{males are}} often ornamented with {{elongated}} feathers or plumes springing from almost {{every part of}} the body. The feathers on the throat and breast are sometimes developed into beautiful ruffs and collars. The tail-feathers are frequently increased in length; as we see in the tail-coverts of the peacock, and in the tail of the <b>Argus</b> <b>pheasant.</b> The body of this latter bird is not larger than that of a fowl; yet the length {{from the end of the}} beak to the extremity of the tail is no less than five feet three inches.[121] The wing-feathers are not elongated nearly so often as the tail-feathers; for their elongation would impede the act of flight. Yet the beautifully ocellated secondary wing-feathers of the male <b>Argus</b> <b>pheasant</b> are nearly three feet in length; and in a small African nightjar (Cosmetornis vexillarius) one of the primary wing-feathers, during the breeding-season, attains a length of twenty-six inches, whilst the bird itself is only ten inches in length. In another closely-allied genus of nightjars, the shafts of the elongated wing-feathers are naked, except at the extremity, where there is a disc.[122] Again, in another genus of nightjars, the tail-feathers are even still more prodigiously developed; so that we see the same kind of ornament gained by the males of closely-allied birds, through the development of widely different feathers.|$|E

60|$|We {{have now}} seen that a perfect series can be followed, from simple spots to the {{wonderful}} ball-and-socket ornaments.

Thus spots spread and fuse into bands, and when a lateral or centrifugal expansion has occurred--as in the termination of the peacocks' train feathers, the outer web of the secondary quills of the <b>Argus</b> <b>pheasant,</b> or the broad and rounded wings of many butterflies--into variously shaded or coloured ocelli. The fact that we find gradations of colour {{in many of the}} more extensive groups, from comparatively dull or simple to brilliant and varied hues, is an indication of some such law of development, due probably to progressive local segregation in the tissues of identical chemical or organic molecules, and dependent on laws of growth yet to be investigated.|$|E
60|$|With {{birds and}} many other animals it seems, from the {{comparison}} of allied species, to follow, that circular spots are often generated by the breaking up and contraction of stripes.

And, on the other hand, that a white spot is often formed by the colour being driven away from a central point, so that it accumulates in a surrounding darker zone. In either case an ocellus is the result. The colouring matter seems to be a nearly constant quantity, but is redistributed, either centripetally or centrifugally. The feathers of the common guinea-fowl offer a good instance of white spots surrounded by darker zones; and wherever the white spots are large and stand near each other, the surrounding dark zones become confluent. In the same wing-feather of the <b>Argus</b> <b>pheasant</b> dark spots may be seen surrounded by a pale zone, and white spots by a dark zone. Thus the formation of an ocellus in its simplest state appears to be a simple affair. By what further steps the more complex ocelli, which are surrounded by many successive zones of colour, have been generated, I will not pretend to say.

But the zoned feathers of the mongrels from differently coloured fowls, and the extraordinary variability of the ocelli on many Lepidoptera, lead us to conclude that their formation is not a complex process, but depends on some slight and graduated change {{in the nature of the}} adjoining tissues.|$|E
