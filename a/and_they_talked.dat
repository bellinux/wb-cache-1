In the production of its fifth studio album, Rock Steady (2001), No Doubt collaborated with Prince, the Neptunes and David A. Stewart and had Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent mixing the album. While the band was on tour to promote the album, Stefani listened to Club Nouveau's 1987's single [...] "Why You Treat Me So Bad" [...] and considered recording material that modernized 1980s music.

500|$|Hoffman was {{selected}} by the Cincinnati Reds in the 11th round with the 288th overall selection of the 1989 MLB draft, and he signed for $3,000. Prior to the draft, Reds scout Jeff Barton talked to Hoffman about playing another position. [...] Hoffman was open to anything that might advance his career, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> about catching or pitching with his exceptional arm. [...] Barton ranked Hoffman's arm an 80 on a 20–80 scale, where 60 was above average and 80 was a rarity. [...] Hoffman played shortstop and third base for the Reds' Single-A affiliate Charleston. [...] In his first 103 games, he only batted [...]212 with 23 runs batted in. [...] Not showing much batting potential, Hoffman was converted to pitcher in 1991 {{at the suggestion of}} Charleston manager Jim Lett, who also grew tired of Hoffman overthrowing first base. Hoffman threw [...] and recorded a 2.90 ERA with 169 strikeouts in [...] minor league innings over two seasons while alternating between relieving and starting at Single-A Cedar Rapids, Double-A Chattanooga and Triple-A Nashville.|$|E

500|$|At the 1963 {{convention}} of the newly formed East Coast Homophile Organizations, the audience heard a speaker named Dr. Albert Ellis tell them that [...] "the exclusive homosexual" [...] was a psychopath. Articles and essays in The Ladder sometimes carried these viewpoints, since {{it was difficult to}} get psychiatrists and doctors to address homosexuality in any form. Gittings said, [...] "People like Ellis talked about homosexuality being a sickness. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> about a cure...We'd sit there and listen and politely applaud and then go for the social hour afterward." [...] However, after Dr. Ellis spoke, so did gay activist Frank Kameny, making an impression upon Gittings with his point that it is useless to try to find cures and causes for homosexuality since there is no valid evidence that it is an illness. Said Gittings, [...] "My thinking didn't change until Frank Kameny came along and he said plainly and firmly and unequivocally that homosexuality is no kind of sickness or disease or disorder or malfunction, it is fully on par with heterosexuality...Suddenly I found that I was looking at things that had happened in the past in a very different light and I was taking a position that was increasingly diverging from DOB’s positions." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chief Flying Hawk long {{remembered the}} gala festivities. [...] "Here {{he and his}} close friend Iron Tail had held a {{reception}} once long ago, for hundreds of their friends, when bankers, preachers, teachers, businessmen, farmers, came from near and far along with their ladies, {{to pay their respects}} and say, Hau Cola!" [...] "Flying Hawk recalled that when dinner was served, Iron Tail asked to have his own and Flying Hawk’s meals brought to them on the open porch where they ate from a table he now sat beside, while the many white folks occupied the dining-room, where they could discuss Indians without embarrassment. This, he remembered, was a good time, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> about {{it for a long time}} together, but now, his good friend had left him and was in the Sand Hills." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{scene and}} song [...] "Life Support" [...] were {{also based on}} Friends in Deed, {{as well as on}} Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the [...] "forget regret" [...] refrain, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> about remembering love. When Jonathan's HIV {{positive}} friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made you angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this [...] "credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay?" [...] Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, [...] "Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?" [...] Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year. Paul asks, [...] "Then why choose fear?" [...] Gordon says, [...] "I'm a New Yorker. Fear's my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It's {{always a}} nice feeling. Sometimes {{you hear it}} on the streets or someone has it on their mobile phone or something… it's a nice feeling! Actually, I did an {{interview}} {{about a year ago}} with a newspaper from America <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> about how much it's been used in sports in America… which I didn't know so much about. Apparently it has been used a lot and it was nice to hear. The ironic thing, though, is that the song was actually written for the fans. It was over six minutes long and was never meant to be a hit or anything like that. It was meant to be an opening for the 'live' show. We were putting out our third album and we wanted a really 'grand' opening for the show. So, I had that 'riff' tucked away in a drawer since my college years and I took it out, found a tempo for it, wrote lyrics, {{and it turned out to}} be a great opening for that album and for the show, as well. Nowadays, we don't rehearse it, but when we play it live, it is still just so amazing! It does communicate so well with the audience and we really love playing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the day of}} his wedding, Imogen told Daniel {{that she}} was in love with him. Phillipps commented that Daniel took Imogen's {{confession}} on board and just went with it. However, after they became trapped in a well, things became awkward between them <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> it through. Phillipps quipped [...] "poor little Imogen gets let down gently yet again." [...] Both Daniel and Imogen thought they would be found quickly, but when someone shut the grill and water was pumped into the well, they realised that they might die down there. However, they were eventually rescued and Phillipps joked that he was relieved that he still had a job. He added that he enjoyed working on the storyline with Kaplan. When Daniel and Amber ended their relationship for a second time, an Inside Soap columnist noted that Daniel was [...] "understandably" [...] upset by the break up. In an effort to cheer Daniel up, Imogen suggested a day out at a local nature reserve. Daniel thanked Imogen with a kiss, after realising his feelings for her. However, Imogen did not react well as she was unsure if Daniel actually liked her, or she was just his [...] "rebound girl".|$|E

2500|$|In 1915, McCreight {{hosted a}} grand {{reception}} for Chief Iron Tail and Chief Flying Hawk at The Wigwam in Du Bois, Pennsylvania. “When Chief Iron Tail was finished with greeting {{the long line}} of judges, bankers, lawyers, business men and neighbors who filed past in a receiving line just as the President is obliged to receive and shake the hands of multitude of strangers who call on New Years, the chief grasped hold of the fine buffalo robe which had been thrown over a porch bench for him to rest on drawing it around his shoulders, walked out on the lawn and lay down to gaze into the clouds and over the hundred mile sweep of the hills and valleys forming the Eastern Continental Divide. He had fulfilled his social obligations when he had submitted to an hour of incessant hand-shaking, as he could talk in English, further crowd mixing did not appeal to him. He preferred to relax and smoke his redstone pipe and wait his call to the big dining room. [...] There he re-appeared in the place of honor and partook of the good things in the best of grace and gentlemanly deportment. [...] His courteous behavior, here and at all places and occasions when in company of the writer, was worthy of emulation by the most exalted white man or woman!” After Chief Iron Tail had shaken hands with the assembled guests he gathered the big buffalo hide about his shoulders, waived aside the crowd and walked away. [...] He spread the woolly robe on the grass, sat down upon it and lit his pipe, as if to say, “I’ve done my social duty, now I wish to enjoy myself.” Chief Flying Hawk long remembered the gala festivities. “Here he himself and his close friend Iron Tail had held a reception once long ago, for hundreds of their friends, when bankers, preachers, teachers, businessmen, farmers, came from near and far along with their ladies, to pay their respects and say, How Cola!” “The historian Chief Flying Hawk reminded that when dinner was served, Iron Tail asked to have his own and Flying Hawk’s meals brought to them on the open porch where they ate from a table he now sat beside, while the many white folks occupied the dining-room, where they could discuss Indians without embarrassment.
