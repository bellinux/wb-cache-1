The selective supplement added contains the antibiotics vancomycin, colistin, nystatin and trimethoprim, to suppress the accompanying flora. Vancomycin is inhibitory for gram-positive bacteria. Colistin inhibits gram negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas species, while Proteus is inhibited by trimethoprim. The combination of trimethoprim and colistin acts synergistically against gram-negative bacilli.

40|$|Yeast {{derivatives}} (YDs – e. g. inactive dry yeasts and yeast <b>autolysates)</b> are extensively used in winemaking {{for a wide}} {{series of}} applications: fermentation enhancers, flavor and aroma modulators, scavengers against undesired compounds and antioxidant preparations. Their ability in releasing soluble compounds and macromolecules suggests their potential application to simulate the traditional practice of ageing on the lees. Nevertheless, {{one of the problems}} connected with the use of such additives during wine ageing is that they may be responsible of the release off-odors into the wine. These compounds are mostly originated from the development of Maillard reaction or lipid oxidation, during the thermal treatments applied for YDs manufacturing. Thus, the development of non-thermal alternative processes for the obtainment of such products may open new opportunities for the production of commercial preparations, specifically tailored for winemaking use. High pressure homogenization (HPH) is a mechanical processing method, used since 1970 s to promote the extraction of intracellular components from microorganisms, including Saccharomyces spp. The ability of HPH to induce cell breakdown is connected with different phenomena (i. e. turbulence, cavitation and shear), occurring when a yeast suspension is forced through the homogenization valve. In the present study, HPH was tested in different conditions (pressure, number of passes) and temperature regimes (controlled vs. uncontrolled), concerning its potential application for the production of yeast <b>autolysates.</b> The performances of this technology were assessed on a commercial strain of Saccharomyces bayanus for winemaking. The <b>autolysates</b> obtained were characterized for their ability to release soluble molecules (e. g. proteins and free amino acids) and glucidic colloids (e. g. glycoproteins) in wine-like medium, for the number of viable cells after the treatment, as well as for their composition regarding volatile compounds, in comparison with both thermolysis and a commercially available YD preparation. HPH demonstrated its capacity in promoting yeast autolysis in a short time and without intensive heating. The release of glucidic colloids increased by increasing the pressure applied and the number of passes and was comparable, or slightly higher, respect to the amounts detected in both thermolysates and the commercial YD preparation. HPH processing variables affected the volatile composition of the final products and their content in amino acids and colloids: in particular, the choice to control or not the processing temperature may allow to obtain <b>autolysates</b> with different characteristics, and suitable for different winemaking applications (i. e. fermentation enhancers or ageing supplements). Compared to thermal treatment, HPH was less effective in promoting Saccharomyces bayanus inactivation. The <b>autolysates</b> produced by HPH showed a more interesting volatile composition, with respect to those obtained by thermolysis, because of the higher content of ethyl esters...|$|R

They also exhibited low proteolytic activity on azocasein, {{but they had a}} high endogenous proteolytic activity with a pH optimum of 5. 8. The endogenous proteolytic activity was inhibited by cysteine proteinase inhibitors, for example, iodoacetate (63. 1 %) and the aspartic proteinase inhibitor, pepstatin (43. 9 %). Inhibitors specific for serine proteinases and metalloproteinases were without effect. The serine and cysteine proteinase inhibitors of microbial origin, including antipain, chymostatin, and leupeptin, caused up to 67 % inhibition of endogenous proteolysis. Hydrolysis of casein by protozoa <b>autolysates</b> was also inhibited by cysteine proteinase inhibitors. Some of the inhibitors decreased endogenous deamination, in particular, phosphoramidon, which had little inhibitory effect on proteolysis. Protozoal and bacterial preparations exhibited low hydrolytic activities on synthetic proteinase and carboxypeptidase substrates, although the protozoa had 10 to 78 times greater hydrolytic activity (per milligram of protein) than bacteria on the synthetic aminopeptidase substrates L-leucine-p-nitroanilide, L-leucine-beta-naphthylamide, and L-leucinamide.

Twenty-four hours after the last skin test each rabbit was injected intratracheally with the same pneumococcus <b>autolysate.</b> Seven non-sensitive controls were similarly injected intratracheally. Twenty-four hours after intratracheal injection the rabbits were killed. The lungs were removed, a portion was cultured, and the rest was examined histologically. Of the twenty sensitized rabbits, three that showed no cutaneous sensitivity and three that were only slightly skin-sensitive at the time of intratracheal injection exhibited no detectable pulmonary reaction to the autolysate; eleven of fourteen that showed moderate to extreme cutaneous hypersensitiveness were found to have an acute exudative inflammation of the lungs. The exudate consisted largely of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and serum. It varied in extent from a slight focal exudate lining the bronchioles and adjacent alveoli to a very marked diffuse involvement of considerable portions of the lung.

40|$|Certain {{writers have}} drawn {{attention}} {{to the effect of}} active immunization or sensitization (1 - 6) on the occurrence or character of lesions in the lungs of animals artificially infected with pneumococci. On the basis of these observations some investigators have attempted to explain the pathogenesis of pneumonia in man. In a recent paper, Stuppy, Cannon, and Falk (7) report that after daily insuffiation of heat-killed pneumococci, rabbits acquire a type-specific immunity arid the reaction of the lung following intratracheal injections of cultures of corresponding types consists of proliferation and exudation with the macrophage the predominant cell. Polymorphonuclear and eosinophilic cells were also present. A similar though less extensive reaction was induced by the intratracheal injection of cultures of heterologous types. Sharp and Blake (8) have shown that the intratracheal injection of an <b>autolysate</b> of Pneumococcus induces no reaction in the lung of normal rabbits but in rabbits previously inoculated with bacteria or <b>autolysate</b> Similar injections stimulate inflammatory changes in the lung which are parallel in severity with the skin reactivity of these rabbits to the same material...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the number of passes and {{processing}} temperature management (controlled vs. uncontrolled) were investigated during high pressure homogenization-induced autolysis of Saccharomyces bayanus wine yeasts, treated at 150 MPa. Both variables were able to affect cell viability, and the release of soluble molecules (free amino acids, proteins and glucidic colloids), but the effect of temperature was more important. S. bayanus cells were completely inactivated in 10 passes without temperature control (corresponding to a processing temperature of 75 C). The two processing variables also affected the volatile composition of the <b>autolysates</b> produced: higher temperatures led to a lower concentration of volatile compounds. The management of the operating conditions may allow the compositional characteristics of the products to be modulated, making them suitable for different winemaking applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{injection}} of virulent pneumococci {{into the skin}} of a rabbit's flank gives rise to an edematous lesion which spreads ventrally until the entire midabdominal area of the skin is involved (1). Previous studies (2) have shown that the edema fluid may be drained from this lesion, and that, if taken during the earlier phases of the infection, this fluid not only fails to clot but has the property of retarding the coagulation of normal rabbit blood. The origin of the antithrombic property of this edema fluid was not definitely proven but it was shown that pneumococcus <b>autolysates</b> a|so possessed a similar property and the suggestion was made that the bacteria might be the source of the anticoagulant substance in the edema fluid. It is not unreasonable to suspect that some of the less well protected microorganisms may be damaged in the earlier phases of the pneumococcus infection, and that the resulting death and dissolution of these less resistant bacterial cells may take place with the liberation of autolytic products which, by retarding coagulation and altering vascular permeability, may promote the invasion of the surviving organisms. In a continuation of the study of this problem, the experiments to be reported in this paper were undertaken to determine whether bacterial <b>autolysates</b> might promote the invasiveness or enhance the virulence of pneumococci. Although in the course of these experiments a variety of different strains of pneumococci of various specific types have been studied, only the results obtained with Pneumococcus Type III are included in the present paper, since strains of this type exhibiting different degrees of virulence for rabbits offer excellent opportunity for the study of infections under selective and experimentally reproducible conditions...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytotoxin {{has been}} {{isolated}} previously from cell <b>autolysates.</b> Both purified cytotoxin and periplasmic contents (osmotic shock fluid) cross-reacted on Western immunoblots with antibodies specific for cytotoxin. In addition, both preparations caused {{a significant reduction}} in antibody-mediated phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa M 2 by mouse macrophage cell line P 388 D 1. Phagocytosis was restored in each case on preincubation of cytotoxin or periplasmic contents with anti-cytotoxin serum. Both cytotoxin and periplasmic contents caused depolarization of the P 388 D 1 cell membrane, as demonstrated with a polarization-sensitive fluorescent probe. Similar correlations were not observed for other P. aeruginosa cell fractions or for osmotic shock fluid from Escherichia coli C 600. These data indicate that P. aeruginosa cytotoxin is localized in the periplasm and has the potential to inhibit macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, possibly by perturbing ion gradients across the macrophage plasma membrane...|$|R
