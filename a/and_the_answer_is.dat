5|$|This {{work was}} {{discovered}} by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in a Greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel, Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous Diophantine equations. There is a more difficult version {{of the problem in}} which some of the answers are required to be square numbers. This version of the problem was first solved by A. Amthor in 1880, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> a very large number, approximately 7.760271.|$|E
25|$|A {{trick is}} to count up valence {{electrons}}, then count up the number of electrons needed to complete the octet rule (or with hydrogen just 2 electrons), then take the difference of these two numbers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> the number of electrons {{that make up the}} bonds. The rest of the electrons just go to fill all the other atoms' octets.|$|E
25|$|In Unscramble this Picture Puzzle, a 3 by 3 or a 4 by 4 sliding puzzle {{is shown}} on the screens, later it became a 5 by 5 sliding puzzle. The puzzle can be a person, a place or an object. When a team buzzes in, the puzzle freezes. The first team to {{identify}} the puzzle gets 10 points for their team and the puzzle is instantly revealed to the audience. If they get it wrong, no points are deducted but they get locked out allowing the other teams to answer it. If all three teams fail to identify the puzzle (scrambled or not), no points are given out <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> revealed.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons {{commonly}} given for why a sadomasochist finds the practice of S enjoyable, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> largely dependent on the individual. For some, taking on a role of compliance or helplessness offers a form of therapeutic escape; from the stresses of life, from responsibility, or from guilt. For others, being under the power of a strong, controlling presence may evoke the feelings of safety and protection associated with childhood. They likewise may derive satisfaction from earning the approval of that figure (see: Servitude (BDSM)). A sadist, on the other hand, may enjoy the feeling of power and authority that comes from playing the dominant role, or receive pleasure vicariously through the suffering of the masochist. It is poorly understood, though, what ultimately connects these emotional experiences to sexual gratification, or how that connection initially forms.|$|E
25|$|In a {{religious}} context, the word fatwa carries more meaning. This is because when a Muslim {{has a question}} {{that they need to}} be answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> known as a fatwa. This fatwa is said by followers to carry more weight than just the random opinion of any person. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwa based on religious scripture, not just their personal opinions. Therefore, their fatwa is sometimes regarded as {{a religious}} ruling. Here is an example of a fatwa: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A person who is going to be on a 12-hour flight may not be able to perform their prayers on time. So they might ask a Muslim scholar for a fatwa on what is the appropriate thing to do, or they might look up the answer in a book or on the internet. The scholar might advise them to perform the prayer to the best of their ability on the plane, or to delay their prayer until they land, for example. And they would support their opinion with scripture. The fatwa is not legally binding or final, it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual doesn't like the fatwa given, he/she can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.|$|E
500|$|On {{existing}} in the MCU, {{specifically in the}} same world as the other Netflix series, Rosenberg said, [...] "Jessica Jones is a very, very different show than Daredevil.

50|$|Bits and Pieces is principally a letters-to-the-editor column. It first {{appeared}} in January 1955. The very first letter printed in the column asked the correct play in a contract of 4, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> to take an Ann Gallagher finesse.|$|R
500|$|... "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] {{was written}} by Marc Wilmore and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore {{as part of the}} twenty-third season of The Simpsons (2011–12). It spoofs the debated status of street art as a true form of art. The title is a reference to Exit Through the Gift Shop, a 2010 street art documentary by graffiti artist Banksy who produced the opening sequence of an earlier Simpsons episode titled [...] "MoneyBART" [...] (2010). The Richard Hawley song [...] "Tonight The Streets Are Ours", which is the theme song of Exit Through the Gift Shop, is included in the episode during a montage of Bart painting graffiti in Springfield. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club noted in his review of [...] "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] that the [...] "reveal that the art show was a police sting gives the show a moment to joke about the anti-art market theme from Exit Through The Gift Shop. Wiggum asks who would be stupid enough to pay for work that an amateur puts up for free in public, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> as in Banksy’s movie, the very wealthy, here represented by Mr. Burns." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Everyone to {{whom the}} problem was put (myself included) said {{something}} like 'that is not my area but the question surely must have been considered <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> probably well known.' Some thought they had seen it, but could not remember where. I was interested because {{it reminded me of}} Sperner's Lemma in topology, which has a clever odd-even proof." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Restoration {{the print}} {{revolution}} {{began to change}} every aspect of British society. It became possible for anyone to spend {{a small amount of}} money and have his or her opinions published as a broadsheet, and {{to gain access to the}} latest discoveries in science, literature, and political theory, as books became less expensive and digests and [...] "indexes" [...] of the sciences grew more numerous. The difficulty lay in discerning truth from falsehood, credible claims from impossible one. Swift writes A Tale of a Tub in the guise of a narrator who is excited and gullible about what the new world has to offer, and feels that he is quite the equal or superior of any author who ever lived because he, unlike them, possesses 'technology' and newer opinions. Swift seemingly asks the question of what a person with no discernment but with a thirst for knowledge would be like, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> the narrator of Tale of a Tub.|$|E

2500|$|On {{specific}} crossovers with Daredevil, {{which had}} completed its first season {{by the time}} Jessica Jones began casting, Loeb said [...] "they’re in the same area.

2500|$|The lyrics {{focus on}} atrocities {{in the history}} of mankind from Satan's point of view {{including}} the trial and death of Jesus Christ ("Made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands to seal his fate"), European wars of religion ("I watched with glee while your kings and queens fought for ten decades for the gods they made"), the violence of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the 1918 shooting of the Romanov family ("I stuck around St. Petersburg when I saw it was a time for a change/Killed the Tsar and his ministers/Anastasia screamed in vain"), and World War II ("I rode a tank, held a general's rank when the blitzkrieg raged, and the bodies stank"). The song was originally written with the line [...] "I shouted out 'Who killed Kennedy?'" [...] After Robert F. Kennedy's death on 6 June 1968, the line was changed to [...] "Who killed the Kennedys?"

60|$|Now therefore, {{when you}} hear me so often saying that the Northern races--Norman and Lombard,--are active, or dramatic, in their art; and that the Southern races--Greek and Arabian,--are contemplative, you ought {{instantly}} to ask farther, Active in what? Contemplative of what? <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> The active art--Lombardic,--rejoices in hunting and fighting; the contemplative art--Byzantine,--contemplates {{the mysteries of the}} Christian faith.|$|E
60|$|You may ask now, comprehending their motive, {{with some}} hope of {{answering}} or being answered rightly. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is,</b> They are the finest gravers' work ever done yet by human hand. You may teach, by process {{of discipline and}} of years, any youth of good artistic capacity to engrave a plate in the modern manner; but only the noblest passion, and the tenderest patience, will ever engrave one line like these of Sandro Botticelli.|$|E

The watchword is Qui vive? <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> L’état c’est moi—that {{was one of his}} favourite remarks, you know.

60|$|Well, {{some of us}} like theory. After so long a {{piece of}} practice, these may be indulged for a few pages. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> at hand. It was plainly desirable, from every {{point of view of}} {{convenience}} and contrast, that our hero and narrator should partly stand aside from those with whom he mingles, and be but a pressed-man in the dollar hunt. Thus it was that Loudon Dodd became a student of the plastic arts, and that our globe-trotting story came to visit Paris and look in at Barbizon. And thus it is, dear Low, that your name appears in the address of this epilogue.|$|E
6000|$|A {{striking}} {{instance of}} reasoning {{in a circle}} is that of some ethical writers, who first take for their standard of moral truth what, being the general, they deem to be the natural or instinctive sentiments and perceptions of mankind, and then explain away the numerous instances of divergence from their assumed standard, by representing them as {{cases in which the}} perceptions are unhealthy. Some particular mode of conduct or feeling is affirmed to be unnatural; why? because it is abhorrent to the universal and natural sentiments of mankind. Finding no such sentiment in yourself, you question the fact; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> (if your antagonist is polite), that you are an exception, a peculiar case. But neither (say you) do I find in the people of some other country, or of some former age, any such feeling of abhorrence; “ay, but their feelings were sophisticated and unhealthy.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is Uncle Hatto inside?" [...] she asked; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> {{given to}} her by her own lover. Yes, he was within; but the old clerk was with him.

25|$|When Franz Joseph {{received}} the telegram informing him of Elisabeth's death, his first {{fear was that}} she had committed suicide. It was only when a later message arrived, detailing the assassination, that he was relieved of that notion.
