This is done through the use of trust and its antecedents (perceived security control, perceived privacy control, perceived integrity, perceived competence, shared values, communication and opportunistic behaviour) along with risk in the channel, social risk and risk in the transaction as independent variables influencing the attitude and intention to shop for products and services via online shopping. A total of 287 respondents in Palestine responded to the survey. The results show that performance expectancy has <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the intention to shop online. <b>A</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>impact</b> of effort expectancy on the intention to shop online is also observed. Social influence has <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the intention to shop online.

The results also show that the attitude toward shopping for products or services via online shopping is salient in determining the intention to shop online.
