50|$|<b>Azimilide</b> {{dihydrochloride}} is a chlorophenylfuranyl compound, which slows repolarization of {{the heart}} and prolongs the QT interval of the electrocardiogram.

50|$|<b>Azimilide</b> blocks hERG {{channels}} (which encode the IKr current) with {{an affinity}} {{comparable to that}} with which KvLQT1 / minK channels (which encode the IKs current) are blocked. This block exhibits reverse use-dependence, i.e. the channel blocking effect wanes at faster pulsing rates of the cell. A possible explanation is an interaction of <b>azimilide</b> with K+ close to its binding site in the ion channel. However, there is an agonist effect as well, which is a voltage-dependent effect. This is a dual effect, a low voltage depolarization near the activation threshold will increase the current amplitude and higher depolarizing voltages will suppress the current amplitude. The effect comes from outside of the cell membrane and {{does not depend on}} G-proteins or kinase activity inside the cell. <b>Azimilide</b> binds on the extracellular domain of the hERG channel, this propagates a conformational change and inhbits the current. This change makes the activation gate open more easily by low voltage depolarization. <b>Azimilide</b> has two separate binding sites in hERG channel, one for its antagonist function and the other for the agonist function.|$|E

New antiarrhythmic therapies are needed to treat patients with this problem. METHODSA total of 384 patients with a history of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or both were randomly assigned to receive once daily doses of placebo or azimilide; recurrent symptomatic arrhythmias were documented using transtelephonic electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. <b>Azimilide</b> 50 mg, 100 mg or 125 mg was tested; the primary efficacy analysis compared the time to first symptomatic recurrence in the combined <b>azimilide</b> 100 mg and 125 mg dose groups with that in the placebo group using the log-rank test.

Additionally, intracellular Ca 2 + ion determinations were made in nasal epithelial cells. Forskolin produced anion secretory currents in wild-type and CF nasal epithelia. It produced similar effects in wild-type colonic epithelia, but not in colonic epithelia from CF mice. After electrogenic Na+ transport was blocked with amiloride and electrogenic Cl− secretion was stimulated with forskolin, the ability of K+ channel blockers to inhibit the forskolin-induced Cl− current was determined.

Kslow was also selectively and reversibly inhibited by the class III antiarrythmic agent <b>azimilide</b> (AZ). In isolated β-cells or islets, pharmacologic inhibition of Kslow by UCL 1684 or AZ depolarized β-cell silent phase potential, increased action potential firing, raised [Ca 2 +]i, and enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion. AZ inhibition of Kslow also supported mediation by SK, rather than cardiac-like slow delayed rectifier channels since bath application of AZ to HEK 293 cells expressing SK 3 cDNA reduced SK current. Further, AZ-sensitive Kslow current was extant in β-cells from KCNQ 1 or KCNE 1 null mice lacking cardiac slow delayed rectifier currents. These results strongly support a functional role for SK channel-mediated Kslow current in β-cells, and suggest that drugs that target SK channels may represent a new approach for increasing glucose-dependent insulin secretion.

The proportion of patients who received a shock could be reduced only from 48 % to 45 %. In contrast, only 16 % of our patients received a shock during a mean follow up of over 2 years. Despite the generally very low risk of arrhythmia, a significant effect of amiodarone could be detected in our study. The occurrence of an electrical storm could be reduced by prophylactic administration of amiodarone. Even though only in a few events without significance. This would need further investigation in more studies with larger patient numbers. Although amiodarone has a good antiarrhythmic effect and reduces the incidence of malignant arrhythmias, it showed no effect in mortality. The antiarrhythmic effects of amiodarone seen in this study would justify a general therapy to reduce the shock frequency. However, do the known side effects often lead to a discontinuation of the therapy. 12 % of our patients stopped taking amiodarone. However, there was no dangerous side effects, such as a thyrotoxicosis, pulmonary fibrosis, etc [...] Overall, the study showed a good effect of prophylactic amiodarone in this patient population. However, it is still unclear whether patients should take amiodarone after the first shock or after multiple shocks...|$|E
40|$|Antiarrhythmic {{drugs are}} used in at least 50 % of {{patients}} who received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The potential indications for antiarrhythmic drug treatments in patients with an ICD are generally the following: reduction {{of the number of}} ventricular tachycardias (VTs) or episodes of ventricular fibrillation and therefore reduction of the number of ICD therapies, most importantly, the number of disabling ICD shocks. Accordingly, the quality of life should be improved and the battery life of the ICD extended. Moreover, antiarrhythmic drugs have the potential to increase the tachycardia cycle length to allow termination of VTs by antitachycardia pacing and reduction of the number of syncopes. In addition, supraventricular arrhythmias can be prevented or their rate controlled. Recently published or reported trials have shown the efficacy of amiodarone, sotalol and <b>azimilide</b> to significantly reduce the number of appropriate and inappropriate ICD shocks in patients with structural heart disease. However, the use of antiarrhythmic drugs may also have adverse effects: an increase in the defibrillation threshold, an excessive increase in the VT cycle length leading to detection failure. In this situation and when antiarrhythmic drugs are ineffective or have to be stopped because of serious side effects, catheter ablation of both monomorphic stable and pleomorphic and/or unstable VTs using modern electroanatomic mapping systems should be considered. The choice of antiarrhythmic drug treatment and the need for catheter ablation in ICD patients with frequent VTs should be individually tailored to specific clinical and electrophysiological features including the frequency, the rate, and the clinical presentation of the ventricular arrhythmia. Although VT mapping and ablation is becoming increasingly practical and efficacious, ablation of VT is mostly done as an adjunctive therapy in patients with structural heart disease and ICD experiencing multiple shocks, because the recurrence and especially the occurrence of "new" VTs after primarily successful ablation with time and disease progression have precluded a widespread use of catheter ablation as primary treatment...|$|E
