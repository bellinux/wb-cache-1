5|$|CNET also {{reviewed}} TuneUp Utilities 2009 {{and gave}} it 5 stars out of 5. “To call TuneUp Utilities 2009 useful would drastically understate the situation”, said Seth Rosenblatt, an associate editor with CNET. He assessed TuneUp Utilities <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> and easy-to-use set of tools, with its disk cleanup and registry cleaner the “bread-and-butter” of the entire set.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{dissolution}} of the court in 1597, the musical style which was inspired by the concerto delle donne spread throughout Europe, and remained prominent for almost fifty years. The concerto delle donne was so influential and often imitated that it became a cliché of northern Italian courts.

It functioned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> tool of propaganda, projecting an image of strength and affluence.|$|E

5|$|During October 7, {{with warm}} water helping to fuel its intensification, Madeline quickly {{intensified}} into a Category 2 hurricane, and was upgraded to a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) early on October 8. Based on hurricane hunter reports, Madeline reached its peak sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a peak pressure of 940 millibars early on the 8th. This made Madeline a moderate Category 4 hurricane. Later that morning Madeline made landfall to the northwest of Zihuatanejo <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> Category 4 hurricane, before it rapidly dissipated over land.|$|E
5|$|During {{its early}} days of settlement, the Lower Clarence {{district}} lacked roads; virtually all communication within the area and {{with the outside world}} depended upon water transport. Lower Clarence settlers were by necessity good oarsmen, and several of them became national and even world champion scullers. Rush, who in his prime was over six feet tall and weighed 13 stone, soon distinguished himself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> 'puller'. He rowed the heavy settlers’ boats, also known as 'butcher boats' delivering meat to Clarence River customers. By 1866, Rush was competing in various regattas regularly held among the riverside settlements of Ulmarra, Lawrence, Brushgrove and Rocky Mouth.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the first}} trial, freed slave Olaudah Equiano brought {{news of the}} {{massacre}} {{to the attention of}} the anti-slavery campaigner Granville Sharp, who worked unsuccessfully to have the ship's crew prosecuted for murder. Because of the legal dispute, reports of the massacre received increased publicity, stimulating the abolitionist movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; the Zong events were increasingly cited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> symbol of the horrors of the Middle Passage of slaves to the New World.|$|E

5|$|More {{recently}} still, Trollope {{scholars have}} looked upon it with increasing favour, describing it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> {{work that has}} suffered undeserved neglect. Present-day critics have focussed increasingly on the Carry Brattle subplot; it has been suggested, {{supported in part by}} the similarity of passages from The Vicar, from the Autobiography, and from The Small House at Allington referring to Johnny Eames, that some aspects of her portrayal are based on the novelist's own early adulthood in London.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{through the}} Ryukyu Islands <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> typhoon, Babe caused {{considerable}} {{damage in the}} region. More than 1,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 7,000 more were damaged or flooded. One person was killed on Amami Ōshima and 77 others were injured throughout the country. Total losses reached ¥6.1 billion (US$23 million). Offshore, over 100 vessels were affected by the storm, including a Panamanian freighter where 13 people lost their lives. In China, more than 24,000 homes were destroyed and nine people were killed.|$|E
5|$|The low-lying damp ground {{can produce}} a visual effect known as a Fata Morgana.

5|$|The mythological kelpie {{is usually}} {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> and beautiful black horse inhabiting the deep pools of {{rivers and streams}} of Scotland, preying on any humans it encounters, One of the water-kelpie's common identifying characteristics is that its hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse, a trait also shared by the nykur of Iceland. An Aberdeenshire variation portrays the kelpie as a horse with a mane of serpents, whereas the resident equine spirit of the River Spey was white and could entice victims onto its back by singing.|$|E
5|$|Though Mala struck Myanmar <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> cyclone, early {{warnings}} and proper evacuations minimized {{loss of life}} along coastal areas. Additionally, no major storm surge was reported, limiting the potential for major damage. The most significant effects were caused inland from torrential rains {{rather than at the}} coast. Overall, the storm claimed 37lives and left 1.24billion kyat (US$6.7million) in damage. Approximately 12,000families were significantly affected by the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Turning {{gradually}} to the north, the typhoon attained peak winds of 250km/h (155mph) on December1. Maintaining strength <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> system for several days, the storm remained over open waters. By December4, {{it began to}} weaken as upper-level winds became unfavorable and forced the cyclone to move northeast. Passing Japan well to the southeast that day, its large circulation brought increased winds to the Tokyo area and heavy rain and snow to parts of the nation. Ophelia soon underwent an extratropical transition as it raced over the open Pacific, completing this structural change by December6. Its remnants later crossed the International Dateline and dissipated over the Gulf of Alaska on December10.|$|E

5|$|Twelve {{publishers}} {{rejected the}} manuscript before {{an editor at}} the Bobbs-Merrill Company risked his job to get it published. Contemporary reviewers' opinions were mixed. Some praised the novel <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> paean to individualism, while others thought it overlong and lacking sympathetic characters. Initial sales were slow, but the book gained a following by word of mouth and became a bestseller. More than 6.5million copies of The Fountainhead have been sold worldwide and it has been translated into more than 20 languages. The novel attracted a new following for Rand and has enjoyed a lasting influence, especially among architects and right-libertarians.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moved westward offshore {{the coast}} of Africa. The wave traveled across the Atlantic, and organized into a tropical depression off the northern coast of Haiti on September 13. The depression turned north and strengthened into a tropical storm and then a hurricane. Hurricane Debby moved north-northeast, brushing Bermuda with tropical storm-force winds. It continued strengthening as it moved north, peaking at 135 miles per hour <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> category 4 hurricane. Hurricane Debby was the only known hurricane on record to reach category 4 north of 38°N latitude, at 38.8° North. Debby was also the second northernmost known Category 4 hurricane Atlantic hurricane, behind Hurricane Ella of 1978. Tropical storm-force winds were also recorded at Cape Race in Newfoundland when Debby passed on September 18. The storm accelerated and began weakening over the colder waters of the north Atlantic. Debby merged with a strong non-tropical system over the British Isles on September 20.|$|E
5|$|After peaking, Hary {{weakened}} due to land interaction, and {{it struck}} Madagascar southeast of Antalaha. After turning south over land, Cyclone Hary quickly moved offshore. There were three {{deaths in the}} country, {{one of which was}} from electrocution. There was locally heavy crop damage, and four bridges were destroyed. However, the damage was considered minimal, given the intensity of the storm. After affecting Madagascar, Hary accelerated to the southeast, and the eastern periphery of the circulation moved over Réunion. On the mountain peaks of the island, rainfall reached , although it was much less near the coast. The rainfall caused flooding, killing one person, and 20,000people were left without power. Hary became extratropical on March13, although its remnants continued for several days <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> mid-latitude storm.|$|E
