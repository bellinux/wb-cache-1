5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be {{calculated}} using various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a rocky planet with a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth, according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as strong <b>as</b> <b>on</b> Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or watery planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an icy and/or watery planet would be at least 1.25 times as strong <b>as</b> <b>on</b> Earth.|$|E
