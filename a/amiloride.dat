25|$|Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. <b>amiloride)</b> â€“ used {{first-line}} use {{to correct}} hypokalaemia.|$|E
25|$|Lithium-induced nephrogenic DI may be {{effectively}} managed {{with the administration}} of <b>amiloride,</b> a potassium-sparing diuretic often {{used in conjunction with}} thiazide or loop diuretics. Clinicians have been aware of lithium toxicity for many years, and traditionally have administered thiazide diuretics for lithium-induced polyuria and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. However, <b>amiloride</b> has recently been shown to be a successful treatment for this condition.|$|E
25|$|The tendency, as for all loop diuretics, {{to cause}} low serum {{potassium}} concentration (hypokalemia) {{has given rise}} to combination products, either with potassium itself (e.g. Lasix-K and Diumide-K Continus) or with the potassium-sparing diuretic <b>amiloride</b> (Co-amilofruse).|$|E
25|$|Since salt {{restriction}} is {{the basic}} concept in treatment, and aldosterone {{is one of the}} hormones that acts to increase salt retention, a medication that counteracts aldosterone should be sought. Spironolactone (or other distal-tubule diuretics such as triamterene or <b>amiloride)</b> is the drug of choice since they block the aldosterone receptor in the collecting tubule. This choice has been confirmed in a randomized controlled trial. Diuretics for ascites should be dosed once per day. Generally, the starting dose is oral spironolactone 100nbsp&mg/day (max 400nbsp&mg/day).|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{a wide variety of}} drugs that can trigger dysgeusia, {{including}} zopiclone, H1-antihistamines, such as azelastine and emedastine. Approximately 250 drugs affect taste. The sodium channels linked to taste receptors can be inhibited by <b>amiloride,</b> and the creation of new taste buds and saliva can be impeded by antiproliferative drugs. Saliva can have traces of the drug, giving rise to a metallic flavor in the mouth; examples include lithium carbonate and tetracyclines. Drugs containing sulfhydryl groups, including penicillamine and captopril, may react with zinc and cause deficiency. Metronidazole and chlorhexidine have been found to interact with metal ions that associate with the cell membrane. Drugs that prevent the production of angiotensin II by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme, eprosartan for example, have been linked to dysgeusia. There are few case reports claiming calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine also cause dysguesia by blocking calcium sensitive taste buds.|$|E
2500|$|As ENaC is {{strongly}} inhibited by <b>amiloride,</b> {{it is also}} referred to as an [...] "amiloride-sensitive sodium channel".|$|E
2500|$|Desmopressin will be {{ineffective}} in nephrogenic DI which is treated by reversing {{the underlying cause}} (if possible) and replacing the free water deficit. The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic) or indomethacin {{can be used to}} create mild hypovolemia which encourages salt and water uptake in proximal tubule and thus improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. <b>Amiloride</b> has additional benefit of blocking Na uptake. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes combined with <b>amiloride</b> to prevent hypokalemia. It seems paradoxical to treat an extreme diuresis with a diuretic, and the exact mechanism of action is unknown but the thiazide diuretics will decrease distal convoluted tubule reabsorption of sodium and water, thereby causing diuresis. [...] This decreases plasma volume, thus lowering the glomerular filtration rate and enhancing the absorption of sodium and water in the proximal nephron. [...] Less fluid reaches the distal nephron, so overall fluid conservation is obtained.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} receptor {{found in}} the mouth is the sodium chloride (salt) receptor. Saltiness is a taste produced primarily {{by the presence of}} sodium ions. Other ions of the alkali metals group also taste salty, but the further from sodium, the less salty the sensation is. [...] A sodium channel in the taste cell wall allows sodium cations to enter the cell. This on its own depolarizes the cell, and opens voltage-dependent calcium channels, flooding the cell with positive calcium ions and leading to neurotransmitter release. This sodium channel is known as an epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and is composed of three subunits. An ENaC can be blocked by the drug <b>amiloride</b> in many mammals, especially rats. The sensitivity of the salt taste to <b>amiloride</b> in humans, however, is much less pronounced, leading to conjecture that there may be additional receptor proteins besides ENaC to be discovered.|$|E
2500|$|Australia's {{success was}} not without its detractors. [...] Accusations of racism were made against the Australian team, one {{incident}} leading to a suspension for Darren Lehmann in 2003. [...] Contacts between Warne and batsman Mark Waugh and illegal bookmakers, at first kept under cover by the ACB, were later revealed by the Australian press, sparking accusations of hypocrisy given Australian cricket's earlier attitude toward match fixing allegations. [...] Warne would later be suspended from all forms of cricket for 12 months after testing positive to [...] banned diuretics hydrochlorothiazide and <b>amiloride.</b> The brand of cricket played by the Australian team was praised for its spirit and aggressiveness but critics charged that this aggressive approach lead to ugly sledging incidents such as the confrontation between McGrath and West Indian batsman, Ramnaresh Sarwan at the Antigua Recreation Ground in 2003. Tasmanian batsman Ricky Ponting would admit to an alcohol problem after incidents in India and in Sydney.|$|E
50|$|Benzamil is a benzyl group-containing analog of <b>amiloride.</b> Like <b>amiloride,</b> it is a guanidinium group-containing {{pyrazine}} derivative.|$|E
50|$|Benzamil or benzyl <b>amiloride</b> is {{a potent}} blocker of the ENaC channel and also a sodium-calcium {{exchange}} blocker. It {{is a potent}} analog of <b>amiloride,</b> and is marketed as the hydrochloride salt (benzamil hydrochloride). As <b>amiloride,</b> benzamil has been studied as a possible treatment for cystic fibrosis, although with disappointing results.|$|E
50|$|Co-amilofruse (BAN) is a non name used {{to denote}} a {{combination}} of <b>amiloride</b> and furosemide, which are both diuretics. Co-amilofruse is a treatment for fluid retention (oedema), either in the legs (peripheral edema) or on the lungs (pulmonary oedema). Furosemide is a loop diuretic and {{is more effective than}} <b>amiloride,</b> but has a tendency to cause low potassium levels (hypokalaemia); the potassium-sparing effects of <b>amiloride</b> may balance this.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amiloride</b> is {{an example}} of an ASIC inhibitor, while not {{considered}} highly potent due to an IC50 value in the micromolar range, has allowed for studies on ASIC inhibition effects on migraines. During a migraine, cortical spreading depression is observed which causes ion imbalances and the release of charged molecules which may activate ASIC. Testing of <b>amiloride</b> in rodents, showed a decrease in the cortical spreading depression during a migraine. Studies showed that <b>amiloride</b> acts as a competitive inhibitor of the ASIC chapters. The use of <b>amiloride</b> also showed side effects in rodents due to inhibition of sodium/ calcium exchangers. The inhibition of these exchangers disrupts cellular calcium homeostasis and causes high levels of calcium in the cell which explains the reduced neuroprotective efficacy with the use of <b>amiloride.</b> The findings that have come through due to ASIC inhibition by <b>amiloride</b> are promising and support the therapeutic potential. However, due to amiloride's lack of specificity and potency, further drug development on its structure will need to be done before a drug can be released.|$|E
50|$|Co-amilozide (BAN) is a non- {{combination}} of <b>amiloride</b> and hydrochlorothiazide. Co-amilozide {{is used in}} the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure with the tendency of the thiazide to cause low potassium levels (hypokalaemia) offset by the potassium-sparing effects of <b>amiloride.</b>|$|E
