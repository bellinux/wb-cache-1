In this paper, an <b>automatic</b> tool <b>wear</b> detection procedure is presented, where real time collected sequence images of the cutting tool during turning tests are subjected to image processing.

The tool wear characteristics and extension area are evaluated on the basis of the processed edge. One by one, sequence images are processed to automatically provide the growth of tool wear characteristics. In order to verify the procedure accuracy, the tool wear characteristics and extension area are also evaluated manually using a grid number counting technique on paper images. The comparison of the results confirmed that the automatic evaluations achieve a high degree of accuracy.

The aims {{of the current study}} were to identify factors that influence the size of helmet worn, identify factors that influence helmet position and adjustment, and examine the effects of helmet size <b>worn</b> and <b>adjustment</b> on helmet stability. Methods: Recreational and commuter cyclists in Sydney were surveyed to determine how helmet size and/or adjustment affected helmet stability in the real world. Anthropometric characteristics of the head were measured and, to assess helmet stability, a test analogous to the requirements of the Australian bicycle helmet standard was undertaken. Results: Two hundred sixty-seven cyclists were recruited across all age groups and 91 % wore an AS/NZS 2063 -compliant helmet. The main ethnic group was Europeans (71 %) followed by Asians (18 %). The circumferences of the cyclists&# 039; heads matched well the circumference of the relevant ISO headform for the chosen helmet size, but the head shapes differed with respect to ISO headforms. Age and gender were associated with wearing an incorrectly sized helmet and helmet adjustment. Older males (> 55 years) were most likely to wear an incorrectly sized helmet. Adult males in the 35 - 54 year age group were most likely to wear a correctly adjusted helmet.

Comparative studies between roller pumps with non-occlusive adjustments and centrifugal pumps {{have been made in}} recent decades in an attempt to develop new products and adjustments that cause fewer traumas to the figurative elements of blood. Usually the roller pumps are adjusted by the static method due to concern variables flow that can occur with non-occlusive settings. Excessive slack in the rollers provokes back flow and can provides errors in the calculation of flow by the rotation of the pump, according to the devices added to the circuit and the systemic resistance of the patient. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the back flow caused by two types of roller pumps in blood aspirator and cardiotomy reservoir. Methods: Back flow visualization was performed in blood aspirator and cardiotomy reservoir. There were tested two different models of roller pumps, adjusted by drop rate and dynamic calibration.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the modern}} {{manufacturing}} systems, machining parameters are fundamental to achieve efficiency {{for the whole}} production process. The feed rate, the cutting speed and several other parameters affect significantly the machining efficiency; furthermore, the selection of an appropriate cutting tool results fundamental to set-up, in the possible best way, the other parameters. This problem {{is one of the}} most complex in machining processes and it refers directly to the quality of the finished product. The life of the selected cutting tool, under the conditions given by the other parameters, is crucial in term of efficiency and it should be estimated as accurately as possible and permanently kept under control. An optical monitoring process (video camera) can observe the tool wear development. The images give the opportunity to drive the process in achieving the target of zero defects manufacturing but there is the need to firstly elaborate and homogenize them, in order to standardize the control and predict the tool wear. By the use of a DNA Based-Computing method, the influence of user-settings on the elaboration of a set of images will be investigated. In order to supply a direction for the development of methodologies for real-time tool wear recognition and prediction in a complex and high automated environment, this paper proposes an approach for the identification of the tool wear defection.

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines (ICEs) {{are widely used}} in many important fields. The valve train clearance of an ICE usually exceeds the normal value due to <b>wear</b> or faulty <b>adjustment.</b> This work aims at diagnosing the valve clearance fault based on the vibration signals measured on the engine cylinder heads. The non-stationarity of the ICE operating condition {{makes it difficult to}} obtain the nominal baseline, which is always an awkward problem for fault diagnosis. This paper overcomes the problem by inspecting the timing of valve closing impacts, of which the referenced baseline can be obtained by referencing design parameters rather than extraction during healthy conditions. To accurately detect the timing of valve closing impact from vibration signals, we carry out a new method to detect and extract the commencement of the impacts. The results of experiments conducted on a twelve-cylinder ICE test rig show that the approach is capable of extracting the commencement of valve closing impact accurately and using only one feature can give a superior monitoring of valve clearance. With the help of this technique, the valve clearance fault becomes detectable even without the comparison to the baseline, and the changing trend of the clearance could be trackable...|$|R

The drilling model based on cutting parameters was constructed using Taguchi method. This method enabled evaluation of wear status based on the actual force obtained from a dynamometer.

Therefore, vision-based tool wear monitoring techniques can help elucidate wear progression. In this study, a drilling model based on the machine vision technique was used to establish a direct relation between cutting parameters and tool wear.

40|$|Transfemoral {{prostheses}} {{are often}} {{covered with a}} flexible Polyurethane foam cosmesis to provide an aesthetic finish and protect the mechanical components. Despite its flexibility, the cosmesis is known to hinder prosthetic joint movement and alter amputee gait particularly in the swing phase. In fact amputees can be advised to keep the limb in full flexion {{for a period of}} time when the limb is first issued in order to stretch the cosmesis and reduce its impact on joint movement. Over time the cosmesis ruptures, typically in the knee area, due to repeated material flexure during gait. Although the cosmesis limitations are evident in clinical practice, the information is largely anecdotal; the impact of the polyurethane cosmesis on the function of the prosthesis has not been addressed in the scientific literature. The aim of this study was to determine if the cosmesis affects the mechanical performance of the prosthesis and consequently alters amputee gait. Three transfemoral amputees were voluntarily recruited for the study (Strathclyde University ethics approval) conducted in a gait analysis laboratory using a VICON (MODEL?) motion analysis system. Temporal gait parameters and joint angles were recorded as the subjects walked at a self-selected speed along a 12 metre level surface under two test conditions: without wearing a cosmesis and wearing a newly fitted cosmesis. Surface markers were attached to the prosthesis or cosmesis at standardised landmarks for kinematic measurement. Differences were measured in the swing phase gait parameters with and without a cosmesis. This is likely to reduce over time as the cosmesis <b>wears.</b> Consequently longitudinal <b>adjustments</b> may be required to accommodate for the cosmesis effect on the mechanical performance of the prosthesis. The findings pose the question why the advanced prosthetic components optimally set up for each amputee are covered with a cosmesis which hinders their operation...|$|R
