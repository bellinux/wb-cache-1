This seed-specific metabolic perturbation stimulated Lys accumulation starting from the initiation of storage reserve accumulation. Our results revealed that the response <b>of</b> seed <b>metabolism</b> to the inducible <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> Lys <b>metabolism</b> was relatively minor; however, that which was observable operated in a modular manner. They also demonstrated that Lys metabolism is strongly associated with the operation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle while largely disconnected from other metabolic networks. In contrast, the inducible <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> Lys <b>metabolism</b> was strongly associated with gene networks, stimulating the expression of hundreds of genes controlling anabolic processes that are associated with plant performance and vigor while suppressing a small number of genes associated with plant stress interactions.

Uremia is associated with a high cardiovascular mortality, the causes of which are still not completely explained, but are related to uremic toxicity, due to the accumulation of retention products.

40|$|The {{pesticide}} rotenone, a neurotoxin that inhibits the mitochondrial complex I, and destabilizes microtubules (MT) {{has been}} linked to Parkinson disease (PD) etiology and is often used to model this neurodegenerative disease (ND). Many of the mechanisms of action of rotenone are posited mechanisms of neurodegeneration; however, they are not fully understood. Therefore, the study of rotenone-affected functional pathways is pertinent to the understanding of NDs pathogenesis. This report describes the transcriptome analysis of a neuroblastoma (NB) cell line chronically exposed to marginally toxic and moderately toxic doses of rotenone. The results revealed a complex pleiotropic response to rotenone that impacts a variety of cellular events, including cell cycle, DNA damage response, proliferation, differentiation, senescence and cell death, which could lead to survival or neurodegeneration depending on the dose and time of exposure and cell phenotype. The response encompasses an array of physiological pathways, modulated by transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory networks, likely activated by homeostatic alterations. Pathways that incorporate the contribution of MT destabilization to rotenone toxicity are suggested to explain complex I-independent rotenone-induced <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> and redox homeostasis. The postulated mechanisms involve the blockage of mitochondrial voltage-dependent anions channels (VDACs) by tubulin, which coupled with other rotenone-induced organelle dysfunctions may underlie many presumed neurodegeneration mechanisms associated with pathophysiological aspects of various NDs including PD, AD and their variant forms.

Arterial acetylcholine (10 microM sinusoidal concentration) caused {{an increase in}} glucose and lactate output and a slight decrease in arterial and portal flow. These effects were accompanied by an output of noradrenaline and adrenaline into the hepatic vein. Portal acetylcholine elicited only minor increases in glucose and lactate output, a slight decrease in portal flow and a small increase in arterial flow, and no noradrenaline and adrenaline release. The metabolic and haemodynamic effects of arterial acetylcholine and the output of noradrenaline and adrenaline were strongly inhibited by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10 microM). The acetylcholine-dependent <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> and the output of noradrenaline were not influenced by the alpha 1 -blocker prazosin (5 microM), whereas the output of adrenaline was increased.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{decline in}} body insulin {{sensitivity}} in apparently healthy individuals indicates {{a high risk}} to develop type 2 diabetes. Investigating the metabolic fingerprints of individuals with different whole body insulin sensitivity according to the formula of Matsuda, et al. (ISI(Matsuda)) by a non-targeted metabolomics approach we aimed a) to figure out an unsuspicious and altered metabolic pattern, b) to estimate a threshold related to these changes based on the ISI, and c) to identify the metabolic pathways responsible for the discrimination of the two patterns. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By applying infusion ion cyclotron resonance Fourier transform mass spectrometry, we analyzed plasma of 46 non-diabetic subjects exhibiting high to low insulin sensitivities. The orthogonal partial least square model revealed a cluster of 28 individuals with alterations in their metabolic fingerprints associated with a decline in insulin sensitivity. This group could be separated from 18 subjects with an unsuspicious metabolite pattern. The orthogonal signal correction score scatter plot suggests a threshold of an ISI(Matsuda) of 15 for the discrimination of these two groups. Of note, a potential subgroup represented by eight individuals (ISI(Matsuda) value between 8. 5 and 15) was identified in different models. This subgroup may indicate a metabolic transition state, since it is already located within the cluster of individuals with declined insulin sensitivity but the metabolic fingerprints still show some similarities with unaffected individuals (ISI > 15). Moreover, {{the highest number of}} metabolite intensity differences between unsuspicious and altered metabolic fingerprints was detected in lipid metabolic pathways (arachidonic acid metabolism, metabolism of essential fatty acids and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids), steroid hormone biosyntheses and bile acid metabolism, based on data evaluation using the metabolic annotation interface MassTRIX. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that altered metabolite patterns that reflect changes in insulin sensitivity respectively the ISI(Matsuda) are dominated by lipid-related pathways. Furthermore, a metabolic transition state reflected by heterogeneous metabolite fingerprints may precede severe <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism.</b> Our findings offer future prospects for novel insights in the pathogenesis of the pre-diabetic phase...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Several factors {{contribute}} to epileptogenesis in patients with brain tumors, including reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic inhibition. In particular, changes in Cl- homeostasis in peritumoral microenvironment, together with <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism,</b> are key processes leading to epileptogenesis in patients afflicted by glioma. It has been recently proposed that alterations of Cl- homeostasis could be involved in tumor cell migration and metastasis formation. In neurons, the regulation of intracellular Cl- concentration ([Cl-](i)) is mediated by NKCC 1 and KCC 2 transporters: NKCC 1 increases while KCC 2 decreases [Cl-] i. Experiments were thus designed to investigate whether, in human epileptic peritumoral cortex, alterations {{in the balance of}} NKCC 1 and KCC 2 activity may decrease the hyperpolarizing effects of GABA, thereby contributing to epileptogenesis in human brain tumors. Methods: Membranes from peritumoral cortical tissues of epileptic patients afflicted by gliomas (from II to IV WHO grade) and from cortical tissues of nonepileptic patients were injected into Xenopus oocytes leading to the incorporation of functional GABAA receptors. The GABA-evoked currents were recorded using standard two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. In addition, immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemical staining were carried out on membranes and tissues from the same patients. Key Findings: We found that in oocytes injected with epileptic peritumoral cerebral cortex, the GABA-evoked currents had a more depolarized reversal potential (E-GABA) compared to those from nonepileptic healthy cortex. This difference of EGABA was abolished by the NKCC 1 blocker bumetanide or unblocking of KCC 2 with the Zn 2 + chelator TPEN. Moreover, Western blot analysis revealed an increased expression of NKCC 1, and more modestly, of KCC 2 transporters in epileptic peritumoral tissues compared to nonepileptic control tissues. In addition, NKCC 1 immunoreactivity was strongly increased in peritumoral cortex with respect to nonepileptic cortex, with a prominent expression in neuronal cells. Significance: We report that the positive shift of EGABA in epileptic peritumoral human cortex is due to an altered expression of NKCC 1 and KCC 2, perturbing Cl- homeostasis, which might lead to a consequent reduction in GABAergic inhibition. These findings point to a key role of Cl- transporters KCC 2 and NKCC 1 in tumor-related epilepsy, suggesting a more specific drug therapy and surgical approaches for the epileptic patients afflicted by brain tumors...|$|E

40|$|The {{infection}} of bacteria by viruses provides a simple system {{with which to}} study the basic processes of viral infection. Until about 1960 detailed bacteriophage research was restricted almost entirely to bacteriophages of Escherichis coli. Since 1960 a number of bacteriophages of Bacilius subtilis have been investigated. B. substilis was chosen as a suitable host organism because it will grow in a simple chemically-defined medium, because auxotrophic mutants may be isolated, and because such mutants may be genetically mapped by transformation. A group of virulent B. substilis phages which are of particular interest contain hydroxymethyluracil in place of thymine in their DNA. They are comparable with the extensively-investigated T-even coliphages which contain hydroxymethylcytosine in place of cytosine in their DNA. The presence of the unusual base provides a means of identifying phase DNA in the infected cell, and of studying the phage-induced <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> necessary for the biosynthesis of the unusual nucleotide. The virulent phages of B. subtilis have therefore been further investigated. By analogy with the T-even coliphages the B. subtilis phages were expected to induce two special classes of enzymes after infection. These are (i) enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of hydroxymethyluracil, and (ii) enzymes which prevent the accumulation of thymidine triphosphate (dTTP) and its subsequent incorporation into phage DNA. The biosynthesis of hydroxymethyluracil is satisfactorily {{accounted for by the}} presence, in phage-infected cells, of an enzyme which hydroxymethylates enzyme which deamintes deoxycytidylic acid may augment the normal intracellular supply of dUMP and thus control the relative levels of phoshorylated derivatives of deoxycytidine and hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine. There is less general agreement about the phage-induced control of thymine biosynthesis. Different B. subtilis phages have been found to induce (i) an enzyme which hydrolyses dTTP to thymidylic acid (dTMP); (ii) an enzyme which hydrolyses dTTP to thymidine; and (iii) a rapid disappearance of the enzyme (thymidylate synthetase), which catalyses a methylation of dUMP to form dTMP. One of the aims of the present investigation was to determine whether one phage induced more than one of the possible mechanisms for preventing the incorporation of thymine into phage DNA. The second object of the work was to investigate the phage øe-induced inactivation of dTMP synthetase. The rapidity of the inhibition and the circumstances of its occurrence suggested the operation of an unusual form of control of enzyme activity. The control of metabolism by agents which inhibit existing enzymes is well-known in the case of feed-back inhibition, where a small molecular weight substance is implicated. The possibility that enzymes may be inactivated is a neglected aspect of metabolic control. A few examples of enzymes disappearing rapidly as a result of phage infection or {{as a result of the}} representation of enzyme synthesis are known and in some cases a protein inhibitor is implicated. The phage-induced inactivation of dTMP synthetase has also been shown to be caused by a protein inhibitor. The properties of the inhibitor and the mechanism of its interaction with dTMP synthetase. The inhibition of dTMP synthetase was detectable 5 min after the addition of phage øe and less than 10 % of the original activity remained at 12 min after infection. If protein synthesis was inhibited no loss of dTMP synthetase occurred. An inhibitor of dTMP synthetase was detacted in extracts from phage-infected cells. It had the properties of a protein. It was heat-labile, non-dialysable, excluded from Sephadex G 25, precipitated by ammonium sulphate and destroyed by digestion with trypsin. The amount of inhibitor present in extracts from phage-infected cells increased for at least the first 25 min of phage infection. It therefore behaved as if it were a phage-induced protein. In order to study the mechanism of the inhibition process, dTMP synthetase was purified 30 fold from uninfected B. substilis using ammonium sulphate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography and gel filtration. The inhibitor was purified 10 - 20 fold from B. substilis cells which were harvested 25 min after infection. The purification of the inhibitor involved ammonium sulphate fractionation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and was complicated by the instability of the inhibitor. The interaction of dTMP synthetase and the inhibitor was studied most thoroughly using their respective ammonium sulphate fractions. However preliminary results with the more highly purified samples of bith proteins tended to confirm the resultsobtained with the less pure system. In order to detect and assay the inhibitor it was necessary to preincubate it with a sample of dTMP synthetase at 37 ° for a short period of time (10 min usually) before assaying the mixture for residual dTMP synthetase activity. The interaction between the two proteins was not instantaneous. Thymidylate synthetase activity continued to decrease for at least 50 min after the addition of the inhibitor. the inhibition reaction was biphasic at both 25 ° and 37 °. An initial fast reaction was followed by a slower linear one. The rate of the fast reaction was dependant on the temperature and pH of the incubation medium and on the concentrations of both the inhibitor and dTMP synthetase except when either was present in a presumed excess. The inhibitor acted directly on dTMP synthetase and was not an enzyme invalidating the essay for the latter. Two possible mechanisms for the action of the inhibitor were considered. It could either act catalytically, or it could act stoichiometrically to form a stable complex with dTMP synthetase. It was not possible to distinguish between these two mechanisms experimentally, the chief problems being the instability of the inhibitor and the absence of any means of identifying inhibited dTMP synthetase. Purification of the two proteins should eventually allow the mechanism of the interaction of dTMP synthetase and the inhibitor was analoguous to its effect on the interaction of the pancreatic trypsin inhibitor with trypsin, and a stoichiometric mechanism is perhaps more likely for this reason. The degree of inhibition of dTMP synthetase in vivo is unknown. It cannot be deduced from the activity found in cell-free extracts because when infected cells were sonicated at pH 6 instead of at the usual level of pH of 7. 5, the extracts contained uninhibited amounts of dTMP synthetase. Thus if the inhibitor functions in vivo the inhibition must be reversed by the violent conditions of celluler disruption, and the final activity of dTMP synthetase observed in cell-free extracts would then be due to a pH-dependent reassociation with the inhibitor. Although these observations also favour a reversible stoichiometric mechanism for the inhibition of dMTP synthetase, since the proposed inhibitor enzyme complex has not yet been dissociated in vitro, the possibility that the inhibitor and dTMP synthetase are brought together by cellular disruption cannot be excluded. The physiological role of the inhibtor. Assuming that the inhibition occurs in vivo, what is its physiological significance? Infection with phage SP 8, which like phage øe contains hydroxymethyluracil in its DNA, was found to cause some inhibition of dTMP synthetase, although it was less effective in this respect than phage øe. Since phage SP 8 induced a dTTPase the possibility that phage øe;e did ikewise was investigated by studying the multiplication of phage &oslah;e in a thymine-requiring host strain supplied with exogeneous thymidine. Multiplication was normal and no thymidine was incorporated into phage DNA. Since in this host the absence of dTMP sythetase is bypassed by the obligatory external supply of thymidine, the result implied that phage øe induced a second block in thymine biosynthetsin. The induction of a dTTPase by phage øe was confirmed by Dr. Roscoe. In view of these results, what is the reason for the inhibition of dTMP synthetase during phage infection? In spite of the presence of a dTTPase the inhibition of dTMP synthetase could have a marginal role. Thymidylate synthetase is believed to be the main mechanism of thymine biosynthesis in B. subtilis although it is not the only source of dTMP. Its inhibitation during phage infection would prevent the wasteful removal of dUMP, which is utilised by the dUMP hydroxymethylase for the biosynthesis of hydroxymethyluracil. In addition, the product of the action of both dTMP synthetase and the phage-infected cell where it has no known role and in which it may even be inhibitory. Conclusion This work has provided an intersting example of the inhibition of an enzyme by a protein in circumstances which suggest that the inhibition could play a role in ensuring succesful viral infection. The inhibition may be one of an increasing number of examples in which the inactivation of an enzyme by a protein inhibitor is provoked by a sudden change in the metabolic balance of a cell. </p...|$|E

Our workflow exploits a recent genome-scale metabolic network model <b>of</b> hepatocyte <b>metabolism</b> to identify metabolites accumulating in hepatocytes due to single gene mutations in IEM via an innovative "differential flux analysis. " We simulated 38 IEMs in the liver, and in about half of the cases, our workflow correctly identified the metabolites known to accumulate in the blood and urine of IEM patients...|$|R
25|$|Ammonia {{toxicity}} {{is believed}} to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries. Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species. At lower concentrations, around 0.05mg/L, un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates, reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases. Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate. At concentrations exceeding 2.0mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death. Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0mg/l.|$|R

A relative lack of testosterone caused by castration {{is associated with a}} diminished rate of virus growth. When protein catabolism is increased by ACTH or cortisone, the rate of virus proliferation decreases. These results suggest the existence of a correlation between <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> protein <b>metabolism</b> and virus proliferation...|$|R
40|$|MET {{is one of}} the {{receptor}} tyrosine kinases (RTKs) {{that are}} overexpressed in malignant cancer types, including breast cancer. While RTKs are traditionally known for their roles in signaling transduction from the cell surface, recent studies have provided evidence demonstrating that most of RTKs can translocate into nucleus to regulate cellular processes in response to both ligand and stress stimulation. Oxidative stress is a common stress in cancer cells due to <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism,</b> and constitutive oxidative stress related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been observed in breast cancer cells. Here, we show that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as well as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) can induce nuclear translocation of full-length MET holoreceptor via a membrane-bound vesicle transport mechanism in breast cancer cells. Our findings provide a putative mechanism by which breast cancer cells adapt to oxidative stress...|$|R

It have been studied acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Using Annexin V-PE Apoptosis Detection Kit and flow cytometer, the amount of cells undergoing apoptosis, in various stages of the antineoplasic treatment, was detected. At the same time, were monitored, the serum level of malondialdehyde. The results obtained confirm the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> the mitochondrial <b>metabolism.</b> We can observed the mitochondrial dysfunction role in cell apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Adrenoleukodystrophy is {{a genetic}} disease with {{heritage}} standard bound to X, which consists <b>of</b> an <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>metabolism</b> and causes {{an accumulation of}} fatty acids {{of a very large}} chain (AGCML) associated to demyelinization of axons and adrenal insufficiency. It may initially manifest with <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> behavior, hearing, vision, speech, writing, gait, and in the more advanced cases, it results in generalized hypertension, loss of cognitive and motor functions and dysphagia. The diagnosis is confirmed by dosing the AGCML’s plasmatic levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of cachexia {{as defined by}} a series of clinical symptoms, such as anorexia, weight loss, muscular atrophy, tissue wasting, altered organ function, is frequently observed in cancer and makes a decisive contribution to morbidity and mortality. The onset of neoplastic cachexia is characterized by two events: the {{presence of}} primary or secondary anorexia and <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> the host's intermediate metabolism. Among the most frequent metabolic alterations described in cancer patients is an absolute or relative increase in basal energy consumption with lack of adaptation to fasting. The causes of increased energy consumption in cancer patients are still not clear. Numerous studies on glucose, fat and protein metabolism induced by cancer have significantly contributed {{to our understanding of the}} phenomenon. The main <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> the glucose <b>metabolism</b> are increased glucose turnover and reduced peripheral utilization, both of which probably depend on the presence of the tumour, as shown by their normalization after treatment. Increased gluconeogenesis, from lactate and from gluconeogenetic AA, is the main factor responsible for increased glucose turnover. The main <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> the fat <b>metabolism</b> are increased mobilization of lipids from adipose tissues, reduced use of exogenous triglycerides and increased oxidation of free fatty acids that cannot be suppressed by glucose. The main <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> protein <b>metabolism</b> are increased protein turnover with reduced synthesis and increased degradation of muscular proteins and increased hepatic protein synthesis. Knowledge of the pathogenesis of neoplastic cachexia represents a valuable aid for its effective prevention and treatment...|$|R

In both groups, {{an increase in}} plasma purine bases and a decrease of their excretion was observed as compared to healthy controls; no substantial variations concerning uric acid were found. Possible mechanisms inducing <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> purine <b>metabolism</b> in so different conditions are discussed...|$|R

Laser photocoagulation to the involved area resulted in a good visual outcome. We propose that the transient improvement in the fluorescein leakage represented a temporary <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> cellular <b>metabolism,</b> or vascular perfusion, attributable to the perfusion solution. We suggest that additional studies are indicated to further explore this phenomenon and its potential clinical applicability...|$|R
40|$|Mitochondria are {{involved}} {{either directly or}} indirectly in oncogenesis and the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> in cancer cells. Cancer cells contain large numbers of abnormal mitochondria and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between the production of ROS and the antioxidant capacity of the cell. Several cancer therapies, such as chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation, disrupt mitochondrial homeostasis and release cytochrome c, leading to apoptosome formation, which activates the intrinsic pathway. This is modulated by the extent of mitochondrial oxidative stress. The peroxiredoxin (Prx) system is a cellular defense system against oxidative stress, and mitochondria in cancer cells are known to contain high levels of Prx III. Here, we review accumulating evidence suggesting that mitochondrial oxidative stress is involved in cancer, and discuss the role of the mitochondrial Prx III antioxidant system as a potential target for cancer therapy. We hope that this review will provide the basis for new strategic approaches in the development of effective cancer treatments...|$|R
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer type for women in the western world. Despite decades of research, the {{molecular}} processes associated with breast cancer progression are still inadequately defined. Here, we focus on the systematic <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> by using {{the state of the art}} metabolomic profiling techniques to investigate the changes of 157 metabolites during the progression of normal mouse mammary epithelial cells to an isogenic series of mammary tumor cell lines with increasing metastatic potentials. Our results suggest a two-step metabolic progression hypothesis during the acquisition of tumorigenic and metastatic abilities. Metabolite changes accompanying tumor progression are identified in the intracellular and secreted forms in several pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid and nucleotide biosynthesis, and the GSH-dependent antioxidative pathway. These results suggest possible biomarkers of breast cancer progression as well as opportunities of interrupting tumor progression through the targeting of metabolic pathways...|$|R
