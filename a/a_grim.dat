5|$|Death (McKinney) is <b>a</b> <b>grim</b> reaper {{assigned}} to collects souls from Shuckton. He has personal vendetta against Ricky – {{who was supposed}} to be aborted before he was born, but who survived the procedure because Death was late to collect his soul. When off duty, he hangs out at the tavern, drinking owl's blood and flirting with voluptuous red-headed women.|$|E
5|$|Caesar's and Guy's Towers are {{residential}} {{and may have}} been inspired by French models (for example Bricquebec). Both towers are machicolated and Caesar's Tower features a unique double parapet. The two towers are also vaulted in stone on every storey. Caesar's Tower contained <b>a</b> <b>grim</b> basement dungeon; according to local legend dating back to at least 1644 it is also known as Poitiers Tower, either because prisoners from the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 may have been imprisoned there, or because the ransoms raised from the battle helped to pay for its construction. The gatehouse features murder holes, two drawbridges, a gate, and portcullises– gates made from wood or metal. The towers of the gatehouse were machicolated.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Kotaku after {{the announcement of the}} remaster, Schafer stated that he has long considered the aspect of <b>a</b> <b>Grim</b> Fandango sequel to further expand on the setting that was created for the game. He felt the story would be a difficult component, as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. However, one option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the Grand Theft Auto series.|$|E

60|$|She {{started up}} with the {{activity}} of a young woman, went to the window, waited till the clergyman passed, and bowed to him solemnly.

5|$|Ramanujam Iyengar alias Ambi is an {{orthodox}} Brahmin and a straightforward consumer protection advocate living in Triplicane, Chennai. He expects everyone {{to follow the}} law and prosecutes those who violate it. However, his efforts fail as circumstantial evidence always seems to favour the accused. He also fails to raise civic awareness due to pervasive corruption and {{a general lack of}} seriousness. Frustrated at his inability to bring about a change in society, his suppressed anger manifests itself in an alter-ego named Anniyan, <b>a</b> <b>grim</b> reaper-themed serial killer who punishes corrupt and indifferent people. Anniyan creates a website, compiles a list of wrongdoers from his site, and kills them using punishments described in the Garuda Puranam, one of the ancient Hindu scriptures.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{at sunrise}} on October 20, the Israeli Air Force {{launched}} aerial attacks {{for the duration}} of the day, targeting Ismailia, the nearby al-Galaa' army base, and Jebel Mariam. Close air support was also provided to advancing ground forces. Israeli aircraft employed ordnance fitted with time fuses, as well as napalm to demoralize Egyptian troops. Shazly left Ismailia that evening, returning to Cairo where he presented <b>a</b> <b>grim</b> evaluation of the military situation to GHQ. His recommendation to withdraw armored forces to counter the Israeli threat on the west bank created a serious command crisis, and ultimately no withdrawal took place.|$|E
5|$|The camera tracks {{down to a}} lower {{floor on}} the building, where small kittens are thrown into a woodchipper-type machine to provide the filling for Bart Simpson plush dolls. The toys are then placed into a cart pulled by a sad panda which is driven by {{a man with a}} whip. A man {{shipping}} boxes with The Simpsons logo on the side uses the tongue from a severed dolphin head to fasten shut the packages. Another employee uses the horn of a sickly unicorn to smash the holes in the center of The Simpsons DVDs. The shot zooms out to reveal that sweatshop is contained within <b>a</b> <b>grim</b> version of the 20th Century Fox logo, surrounded by barbed wire, searchlights, and a watchtower.|$|E
5000|$|Enthusiasm faded {{with the}} {{enormous}} numbers of casualties, the dwindling supply of manpower, the mounting difficulties on the homefront, and the never-ending flow of casualty reports. <b>A</b> <b>grimmer</b> and grimmer attitude began to prevail amongst the general population. The highlight {{only was the}} first use of mustard gas in warfare, in the Battle of Ypres.|$|R
50|$|Quintard Mall was {{developed}} by James <b>A.</b> <b>Grimmer</b> and opened in August 1970. At that time, the mall included thirty-two inline tenants and two anchor stores: J.C. Penney and Britt's Department Store, the department store division of J.J. Newberry. The Britt's store was closed in the early 1980s and replaced with Sears, which expanded the Britt's building in 1997.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Henry {{smiled to}} himself; <b>a</b> <b>grimmer</b> smile I never witnessed. [...] "You did exactly well," [...] said he. [...] "He shall drink his Jessie Broun to the dregs." [...] And then, spying the Master outside, {{he opened the}} window, and crying {{to him by the}} name of Mr. Bally, asked him to step up and have a word.|$|R

Jabba is introduced as the de facto leader of the Desilijic-Hutt Cartel, and the most powerful crime boss on Tatooine, who has a bounty on Han Solo's head. Jabba employs a retinue of career criminals, bounty hunters, smugglers, assassins and bodyguards to operate his criminal empire. He keeps a host of entertainers at his disposal at his palace: slaves, droids and alien creatures. Jabba has <b>a</b> <b>grim</b> sense of humor, an insatiable appetite, and affinities for gambling, slave girls, and torture.|$|E
5|$|While Pierce {{was popular}} and outgoing, his family life was <b>a</b> <b>grim</b> affair, {{with his wife}} Jane {{suffering}} from illness and depression for much of her life. All of their children died young, their last son being gruesomely killed in a train accident while the family was traveling shortly before Pierce's inauguration. As president, Pierce simultaneously attempted to enforce neutral standards for civil service while also satisfying the diverse elements of the Democratic Party with patronage, an effort which largely failed and turned many in his party against him. Pierce was a Young America expansionist who signed the Gadsden Purchase of land from Mexico and led a failed attempt to acquire Cuba from Spain. He signed trade treaties with Britain and Japan, while his Cabinet reformed their departments and improved accountability, but these successes were overshadowed by political strife during his presidency.|$|E

25|$|Futuristic London is terrorized in the 2006 film V for Vendetta (#1 in U.S.) by a mysterious, masked anarchist {{who wishes}} to destroy the fascist government.

Hola Mahalla became an annual event held in an open ground near Holgarh, a Fort across the rivulet Charan Ganga, northwest of Anandpur sahib.|$|R

Riviera also contains dating sim elements, as the hero can achieve multiple endings with the supporting characters through decisions made throughout the game.|$|E
25|$|In The Caves of Steel and its sequels (the {{first of}} which is The Naked Sun), Asimov paints <b>a</b> <b>grim</b> {{situation}} of an Earth dealing with an extremely large population, and of luxury-seeking Spacers who limit birth to permit great wealth and privacy. Asimov, who {{described himself as a}} claustrophile, mentioned that a reader asked him how he could have imagined such an existence with no sunlight, and related that it had not struck him until then that living perpetually indoors might be construed as unpleasant.|$|E
25|$|After Batman Begins, Bale {{returned}} to appearing in independent films. He was cast {{as one of}} the two lead roles in the South Central Los Angeles David Ayer-helmed crime drama Harsh Times, co-starring Freddy Rodriguez and Eva Longoria.

25|$|Childhood on the American {{frontier}} is contested territory. One {{group of}} scholars, {{following the lead}} of novelists Willa Cather and Laura Ingalls Wilder, argue the rural environment was beneficial to the child's upbringing. Historians Katherine Harris and Elliott West write that rural upbringing allowed children to break loose from urban hierarchies of age and gender, promoted family interdependence, and in the end produced children who were more self-reliant, mobile, adaptable, responsible, independent and more in touch with nature than their urban or eastern counterparts. On the other hand, historians Elizabeth Hampsten and Lillian Schlissel offer <b>a</b> <b>grim</b> portrait of loneliness, privation, abuse, and demanding physical labor from an early age. Riney-Kehrberg takes a middle position.|$|E
