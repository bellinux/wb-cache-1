5|$|By {{the time}} of season two's nineteenth episode, the writers had decided Helen's fate. Originally, the {{character}} {{was going to die}} on her wedding night, but the creative team felt they could use her more in the mythology. Gough explains the idea Helen still had Clark's blood, she knew his secret, and her relationship with Lex was too good to write off. The creative team kept Helen's true motivations a secret to Vaugier, which the actress enjoyed because it allowed her to play the character <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no ulterior motives.|$|E
5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong {{on the surface and}} became the second human to set foot on the Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, {{also known}} as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65microteslas (0.25 to 0.65gauss). Roughly speaking it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a bar magnet placed at that angle {{at the center of the}} Earth. The North geomagnetic pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. Unlike a bar magnet, Earth's magnetic field changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo (in Earth's case, the motion of molten iron alloys in its outer core).|$|E

5|$|Hybrids are not {{as might}} be {{expected}} always intermediate between their parents (<b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage. This is most common with plant hybrids. A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E
5|$|ACAs {{have three}} ports: the OTG port for the {{portable}} device, which {{is required to}} have a Micro-A plug on a captive cable; the accessory port, which is required to have a Micro-AB or type-A receptacle; and the charging port, which is required to have a Micro-B receptacle, or type-A plug or charger on a captive cable. The ID pin of the OTG port is not connected within plug as usual, but to the ACA itself, where signals outside the OTG floating and ground states are used for ACA detection and state signaling. The charging port does not pass data, but does use the D± signals for charging port detection. The accessory port acts as any other port. When appropriately signaled by the ACA, the portable device can charge from the bus power <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a charging port present; any OTG signals over bus power are instead passed to the portable device via the ID signal. Bus power is also provided to the accessory port from the charging port transparently.|$|E

2500|$|However, in the White Paper of 1939, the British {{government}} under Neville Chamberlain abandoned {{the idea of}} establishing a Jewish Commonwealth.

25|$|Around {{the turn}} of the century, Boltzmann's science was being {{threatened}} by another philosophical objection. Some physicists, including Mach's student, Gustav Jaumann, interpreted Hertz to mean that all electromagnetic behavior is continuous, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no atoms and molecules, and likewise as if all physical behavior were ultimately electromagnetic. This movement around 1900 deeply depressed Boltzmann since it could mean the end of his kinetic theory and statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|During the epidemic, normal {{gameplay}} was disrupted. Player responses varied but resembled real-world behaviors. Some {{characters with}} healing abilities volunteered their services, some lower-level characters {{who could not}} help would direct people away from infected areas, some characters would flee to uninfected areas, and some characters attempted to spread the disease to others. Players in the game reacted to the disease <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> real risk to their well-being. Blizzard Entertainment attempted to institute a voluntary quarantine to stem the disease, but it failed, as some players didn't take it seriously, while others {{took advantage of the}} pandemonium. Despite certain security measures, players overcame them by giving the disease to summonable pets. Blizzard was forced to fix the problem by instituting hard resets of the servers and applying quick fixes.|$|E

25|$|The {{propagation}} (as well as reflection coefficient) of {{the ordinary}} ray is simply described by no <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no birefringence involved. However the extraordinary ray, as its name suggests, propagates unlike any wave in a homogenous optical material. Its refraction (and reflection) at a surface can be understood using the effective refractive index (a value in between no and ne). However {{it is in fact}} an inhomogeneous wave whose power flow (given by the Poynting vector) is not exactly {{in the direction of the}} wave vector. This causes an additional shift in that beam, even when launched at normal incidence, as is popularly observed using a crystal of calcite as photographed above. Rotating the calcite crystal will cause one of the two images, that of the extraordinary ray, to rotate slightly around that {{of the ordinary}} ray, which remains fixed.|$|E
25|$|Louis Shuster and Nicholas Dodman {{noticed that}} dogs often {{demonstrate}} obsessive and compulsive behaviors similar to humans. Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) {{is not only}} specific only to certain breeds of dogs, but the breed may affect the specific types of compulsions. For example, bull terriers frequently exhibit obsessively predatory or aggressive behaviors. Breed may factor into the types of compulsions, but some behaviors are more common across the canine spectrum. Most commonly, CCD is seen in canines as they repeat behaviors such as chasing their tails, compulsively chewing on objects, or licking their paws excessively, similar to the common hand-washing compulsion many people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder have. Hallucinating and attacking the air around their head, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a bug there, is another compulsion that has been seen in some dogs. Circling, hair biting, staring, and sometimes even barking are other examples of behaviors that are considered compulsions in dogs when taken to extreme, repetitive actions.|$|E
25|$|Most of Craig's {{agenda was}} never {{implemented}} as the legislature {{accused him of}} not working with them, but in large part it was his differences with party leaders that caused the problems. A Democratic senator observed that it was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> three parties in the assemblythe pro-Craig, the anti-Craig, and the Democratic parties. Craig was successful in having the Department of Corrections created, which he used to implement most of his penal reform. The Uniform Traffic Code was also established, which standardized road signs, speed limits, and traffic rules across the state. Funding was also granted to improve safety by installing signage and signal lights around the state. The police academy was expanded and the first narcotics group. The state police force was expanded to add fifty new officers, making it {{the largest in the}} nation at the time. The state's Mental Health Division was also established to reform the state's mental hospitals.|$|E

25|$|On {{the third}} day, Bhishma {{arranged}} the Kaurava {{forces in the}} formation of an eagle with himself leading from the front, while Duryodhana's forces protected the rear. Bhishma wanted to be sure of avoiding any mishap. The Pandavas countered this by using the crescent formation with Bhima and Arjuna {{at the head of the}} right and the left horns, respectively. The Kauravas concentrated their attack on Arjuna's position. Arjuna's chariot was soon covered with arrows and javelins. Arjuna, with amazing skill, built a fortification around his chariot with an unending stream of arrows from his bow. Abhimanyu and Satyaki combined to defeat the Gandhara forces of Shakuni. Bhima and his son Ghatotkacha attacked Duryodhana in the rear. Bhima's arrows hit Duryodhana, who swooned in his chariot. His charioteer immediately drove them out of danger. Duryodhana's forces, however, saw their leader fleeing the battlefield and soon scattered. Bhishma soon restored order and Duryodhana returned to lead the army. He was angry at Bhishma, however, at what he saw as leniency towards the five Pandava brothers and spoke harshly at his commander. Bhishma, stung by this unfair charge, fell on the Pandava army with renewed vigor. It was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> more than one Bhishma on the field.|$|E

[...] The author, Heather Love, writes that the film used a classic theme in literature and film depicting lesbian relationships: Camilla as achingly beautiful and available, rejecting Diane for Adam. Popular reaction to the film suggests the contrasting relationships between Betty and Rita and Diane and Camilla are [...] "understood as both the hottest thing on earth and, at the same time, as something fundamentally sad and not at all erotic" [...] as [...] "the heterosexual order asserts itself with crushing effects for the abandoned woman".|$|E

500|$|For a time, Very {{tried to}} recruit Nathaniel Hawthorne as a brother figure in his life. Though Hawthorne treated him kindly, {{he was not}} {{impressed}} by Very. Unlike Hawthorne, Emerson found him [...] "remarkable" [...] and, when Very showed up at his home unannounced along with Cornelius Conway Felton in 1838, Emerson invited several other friends, including Henry David Thoreau, to meet him. Emerson, however, was surprised at Very's behavior in larger groups. [...] "When {{he is in the}} room with other persons, speech stops, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a corpse in the apartment", he wrote. Even so, in May 1838, the same month Very published his [...] "Epic Poetry" [...] lecture in the Christian Examiner, Emerson brought Very to a meeting of the Transcendental Club, where the topic of discussion was [...] "the question of mysticism". At the meeting, held at the home of Caleb Stetson in Medford, Massachusetts, Very was actively engaged in the discussion, building his reputation as a mystic within that circle.|$|E
500|$|Like the tale's {{companion}} piece {{set in the}} Newlands Valley, The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the cat and dog {{story is}} set in a real place, Near Sawrey, and is the only Potter tale to refer to Sawrey by name. Tabitha Twitchit disdainfully comments on her cousin's choice of party guest: [...] "A little dog, indeed! Just <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no CATS in Sawrey!"

Ribby's counterpart lived in Sawrey, and Tabitha Twitchit's counterpart lived at Hill Top, though her fictional shop is located in nearby Hawkshead. Dr. Maggotty was drawn from magpies in the London Zoological Gardens. Potter made notes in her sketchbook about the bird's anatomical structure and the colour of its feathers: [...] "Brown black eye, nose a little hookier than jackdaw, less feathered." [...] The bird's tail was over half its total length she noted, and its feathers were [...] "very blue" [...] and parts were green.|$|E
500|$|Since then, general {{relativity}} has been acknowledged as {{the theory that}} best explains gravity. In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time – defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. From {{the perspective of the}} object, all motion occurs <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years). The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as [...] "gravitational force".|$|E
