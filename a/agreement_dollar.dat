40|$|The term GNMA rolls {{has been}} used broadly {{to refer to a}} variety of {{transactions}} involving mortgage-backed securities, frequently those issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). Four basic types of transactions are involved: 1. Reverse repurchase agreements for which the exact same security is received {{at the end of the}} repurchase period (vanilla repo) 2. Fixed coupon <b>dollar</b> reverse repurchase <b>agreements</b> (<b>dollar</b> repo) 3. Fixed coupon <b>dollar</b> reverse repurchase <b>agreements</b> that are rolled at their maturities, that is, renewed in lieu of taking delivery of an underlying security (GNMA roll) Copyright © 2010, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistribution Page 14. Forward commitment dollar rolls (also referred to as To Be Announced [TBA] GNMA forward contracts or TBA GNMA rolls), for which the underlying security does not yet exist. The issues are (1) whether the above transactions should be accounted for as financings or as separate sales and repurchases and (2) if considered separate sales and repurchases, how change...|$|R

50|$|In 1999, the Manitoba {{government}} under NDP leadership, began its ongoing relationship with Monsanto, accepting a 12.5 million <b>dollar</b> <b>agreement</b> {{to bring in}} its first development centre. In 2005, Gary Doer announced a deal to allow Monsanto to build their 42,000 square foot Canadian head office in Manitoba.|$|R
50|$|Many {{people use}} life insurance, and in {{particular}} cash value life insurance, {{as a source of}} benefits to the owner of the policy (as opposed to the death benefit, which provides benefit to the beneficiary). These benefits include loans, withdrawals, collateral assignments, split <b>dollar</b> <b>agreements,</b> pension funding, and tax planning.|$|R
60|$|The upper claim {{during the}} time it was worked by Dr. Barwaithe and Captain Zoss in the spring had yielded five {{thousand}} dollars. Of this, as per <b>agreement,</b> two thousand <b>dollars</b> went to the doctor, a like sum to the captain, and one thousand dollars to Foster Portney. Added to what they had made previously, the doctor and the captain now held a matter of nine thousand dollars' worth of gold between them. Not a fortune, but still a tidy sum, all things considered.|$|R
50|$|In November 2006 the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a United States {{foreign aid}} agency, signed a 460 million US <b>dollar</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Malian Government {{to develop the}} Alatona zone of the Office du Niger and to upgrade Bamako Airport. The project was {{intended}} to run {{for a period of}} five years between September 2007 to September 2012 but was terminated in May 2012 after a military coup deposed the elected civilian government of Amadou Toumani Touré. Of the total investment, 235 million US dollars were assigned to the Alatona irrigation project.|$|R
50|$|This {{was meant}} to be a {{temporary}} measure, with the gold price of the dollar and the official rate of exchanges remaining constant. Revaluing currencies was the main purpose of this plan. No official revaluation or redemption occurred. The dollar subsequently floated. In December 1971, the “Smithsonian Agreement” was reached. In this <b>agreement,</b> the <b>dollar</b> was devalued from $35 per troy ounce of gold to $38. Other countries' currencies appreciated. However, gold convertibility did not resume. In October 1973, the price was raised to $42.22. Once again, the devaluation was insufficient. Within two weeks of the second devaluation the dollar was left to float. The $42.22 par value was made official in September 1973, long after it had been abandoned in practice. In October 1976, the government officially changed the definition of the dollar; references to gold were removed from statutes. From this point, the international monetary system was made of pure fiat money.|$|R

40|$|The {{price of}} {{professional}} portfolio management {{provided by the}} mutual fund adviser depends {{not only on the}} fund characteristics but also on the fund objective, the adviser's portfolio related and management based decisions, and the portfolio performance. I analyze the advisory fee, using a survivorship bias free data set of 176 equity funds managed by 125 different advisers. Advisers benchmark the objective average but this benefit the shareholders only when the objective trend is descending. Advisers tend to reduce the cost of their marginal product through the use of derivatives or manipulate by engaging in soft <b>dollar</b> <b>agreements.</b> I find that the advisers actively manage the advisory fee contracts responding to the outcome of their management decisions. The advisory fee increases after voluntary fee reimbursement or if the adviser is not fully reimbursed for the compensation of independent directors and officers...|$|R
50|$|In 2012, {{the tiny}} {{township}} {{was selected as}} the Most Outstanding Community in New South Wales and the ACT (with a population of 15,000 or less) in a competition organised by the Bank of New South Wales. The town sealed its local airstrip, installed kangaroo-proof fences around the perimeter, and put in night lighting, with half of the costs coming from private donations. Locals had been upset that the Royal Flying Doctor Service {{had not been able to}} land there for a medical emergency involving one of the leading members of the local population. The town also successfully searched the world to recruit its own doctor, when the Health Department had said that no suitable doctor could be found. And five locals came forward to form a team of local volunteer ambulance officers, in support of the one full-time paramedic that is provided by the NSW Ambulance Service. Finally, the town constructed a spacious sports centre in a <b>dollar</b> for <b>dollar</b> <b>agreement</b> with the local Shire. All of these projects in the one year contributed to Tottenham's selection as Community of the Year for NSW.|$|R
40|$|A bank {{promises}} to lend several {{billion dollars to}} fund a buyer’s purchase of a target company. The buyer enters into a merger agreement with the target. Thereafter, the economy plummets, and the bank decides that breaching its contract with the buyer will cost less than performing. The buyer seeks specific performance. The target also sues the bank, alleging tortious interference with the merger <b>agreement.</b> Billions of <b>dollars</b> are on the line. This is the reality lived by many investment banks that committed to fund leveraged buyouts during the recent economic downturn. Most of these matters were resolved in private settlements to avoid the possibility of crippling tort liability and publicly airing the messy details of the targets’ poor financial circumstances. The judicial decisions that do exist reveal a myopic view {{of the relationship between}} the buyer’s specific performance claim against the bank, on the one hand, and the target’s tort claim against the bank, on the other. By treating these claims as substantively distinct, courts threaten to impose an inefficient liability rule for the bank’s allegedly tortious conduct (including the possibility of punitive damages) and an equally inefficient property rule for the bank’s alleged breach of contract (specific performance). Courts must take a singular view of the combined costs and efficiencies created by the buyer’s and target’s individual claims to properly determine the appropriate remedy for the bank’s conduct...|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the Bretton Woods system, the U.S. had to run a balance of payments current account deficit to provide liquidity for the conversion of gold into U.S. dollars. With more U.S. dollars in the system than were backed with gold under the Bretton Woods <b>agreement,</b> the U.S. <b>dollar</b> was overvalued. This meant that the United States had less gold as foreign governments started converting U.S. dollars to gold and taking it offshore. Foreign speculators were not a direct part of the gold flow out of the US, as under the Bretton Woods Agreement, only governments could exchange US currency for physical gold. Additionally, while the Bretton Woods Agreement was in place, direct speculation by US citizens who were banned from owning any gold other than jewelry following Executive Order 6102 which was enacted in 1933 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and enabled the US Government to confiscate all gold coinage, gold certificates, and gold bullion held by any citizen, did not contribute to the price imbalance and arbitrage opportunity via a wide disparity of gold prices between the US and other markets. A price ceiling had been enacted which fixed the price of gold at $35/oz USD following the previously mentioned gold confiscation from US citizens in 1933. As with all price controls, this caused supply and demand imbalances and an arbitrage opportunity which rapidly depleted the United States gold reserves. This led to less gold in the country and caused the US Dollar to become more overvalued, leading to a self-propagating cycle. Furthermore, the US had to run a balance of payments current account surplus to maintain confidence in the U.S. dollar.|$|R
