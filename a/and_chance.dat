5|$|Time <b>and</b> <b>Chance</b> (2002), a New York Times Bestseller, {{continues}} {{the story of}} Eleanor of Aquitaine and her husband, and focuses on the rift between Henry II and Thomas Becket. Time <b>and</b> <b>Chance</b> spans a 15-year period from 1156 to 1171 as Henry II became estranged from his wife (although Eleanor and Henry have eight children during thirteen years), and from his close friend and advisor Thomas Becket. King Henry's decision to elevate Becket to the Archbishop of Canterbury becomes a fulcrum for discord between Henry and Eleanor.|$|E

5|$|Following the SEC Championship Game, {{multiple}} Alabama {{players were}} recognized for their on-field performances {{with a variety}} of awards and recognitions. At the team awards banquet on December 2, Barrett Jones, Damian Square <b>and</b> <b>Chance</b> Warmack were each named the permanent captains of the 2012 squad. At that time C. J. Mosley was also named the 2012 most valuable player with Nico Johnson and Dee Milliner named defensive players of the year and AJ McCarron and Jones named offensive players of the year.|$|E

5|$|Lowe {{suffered}} {{a knee injury}} late in the 1902 season, providing Evers with more playing time. Tinker, Evers, <b>and</b> <b>Chance</b> first appeared in a game together on September 13, 1902. They turned their first double play on September 15, 1902. Lowe's injury did not properly heal during the offseason, making Evers the new permanent second baseman for the Cubs in 1903. Chance succeeded Selee as manager during the 1905 season when Selee became ill.|$|E
5|$|The Cubs, led by Tinker, Evers, <b>and</b> <b>Chance,</b> won the National League pennant in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1910. In 1908, the Cubs {{clinched}} the pennant after defeating the Giants {{in part due}} to Merkle's Boner. In the Merkle game, Tinker hit a home run off Christy Mathewson, and Evers alerted umpire Hank O'Day to Merkle's baserunning gaffe. In the replay of the Merkle game, Tinker hit a triple off Mathewson that started the rally that gave the Cubs the victory, clinching the pennant.|$|E

5|$|Thematically, Rebel Heart {{represents}} the singer's romantic and rebellious sides. The themes grew organically during the writing and recording sessions. Musically, it is a pop record which merges {{an array of}} genres such as 1990s house, trap, and reggae, {{as well as the}} use of acoustic guitars and gospel choir.

5|$|After {{their victory}} over Notre Dame for the {{national}} championship, the team arrived at Tuscaloosa Regional Airport {{on the afternoon of}} January 8, and several hundred fans were there to greet them upon their arrival. On January 19, a championship parade was made through the streets of Tuscaloosa in recognition of the 2012 championship season. The parade concluded with Eli Gold as the master of ceremonies for an event on the Walk of Champions at Bryant–Denny Stadium that honored the 2012 team. On April 16, the team made their trip to the White House, where President Barack Obama offered congratulatory remarks for their championship season. As part of the A-Day celebrations on April 20, the 2012 team captains Barret Jones, Damion Square <b>and</b> <b>Chance</b> Warmack were honored at the Walk of Fame ceremony at the base of Denny Chimes.|$|E
5|$|All {{three players}} were {{inducted}} into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. Their inductions have been credited to the fame generated by Adams' poem. Andy Coakley, a teammate with the Cubs {{as well as a}} coach for Columbia University, regarded Tinker, Evers, <b>and</b> <b>Chance</b> to be the best infield in baseball history. Bill James, in his 1994 book, Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?, argued that Tinker was less accomplished than George Davis, who at the time was {{not a member of the}} Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the season, the Alabama defense led the nation in total defense, scoring defense and rushing defense and ranked 7th in passing defense. Offensively, the Alabama offense ranked 12th in scoring offense, 16th in rushing offense, 31st in total offense and 75th in passing offense. Starting quarterback AJ McCarron was ranked first nationally in pass efficiency. Additionally, several players were recognized for their individual accomplishments on the field. Starting center Barrett Jones won both the Rimington Trophy and the William V. Campbell Trophy, and was named as the Academic All-America of the Year; defensive coordinator Kirby Smart was named the 2012 American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) FBS Assistant Coach of the Year. Also, five players were named to various All-America Teams with Jones and C. J. Mosley being consensus selections and Dee Milliner <b>and</b> <b>Chance</b> Warmack being unanimous selections.|$|E

5|$|Considering {{the weight}} of attack against airfields, hardly any fighters were {{destroyed}} on the ground. Figures indicated just two Spitfires and six Hurricanes were lost in this manner. The main reason for this was the high state of readiness of RAF units during daylight. The command depended on radar and the Observer Corps warning them in advance, giving them {{plenty of time to}} get airborne. The successful strafing attack by Bf 109s of JG 52 on Manston depended on a combination of circumstances <b>and</b> <b>chance</b> which did not occur often during the battle.|$|E
5|$|For their {{individual}} performances {{during the regular}} season, several players were named to various national All-American Teams. Dee Milliner, C. J. Mosley <b>and</b> <b>Chance</b> Warmack were named to the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) All-America Team. Barrett Jones, Milliner, Mosley and Warmack were named to the Walter Camp All-America First Team (WC). D. J. Fluker {{was named to the}} Walter Camp All-America Second Team.

Jones, Milliner and Warmack were named to the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) All-America Team.|$|E
5|$|Genetic drift (also {{known as}} allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, <b>and</b> <b>chance</b> has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.|$|E

5|$|Of all the draft-eligible juniors, D. J. Fluker, Eddie Lacy and Dee Milliner {{declared}} their {{eligibility for}} the 2013 NFL Draft on January 11. At {{the time of}} their announcement, Milliner was projected to be a first-round pick and both Fluker and Lacy were projected to be no lower than second-round picks. Adrian Hubbard, AJ McCarron, C. J. Mosley and Anthony Steen had each previously indicated they would not declare for the draft and would return for their senior seasons. In February 2013, ten Alabama players, seven seniors and three juniors, were invited to the NFL Scouting Combine. The invited players were defensive linemen Quinton Dial, Damion Square and Jesse Williams, linebacker Nico Johnson, defensive backs Robert Lester and Dee Milliner, running back Eddie Lacy and offensive linemen D. J. Fluker, Barrett Jones <b>and</b> <b>Chance</b> Warmack.|$|E
5|$|The Maudsley–Bethlem {{study also}} {{hypothesized}} that schizophrenia {{was caused by}} a mixture of many small traits working together. These endophenotypes could be used for diagnosis. Endophenotypes have been interpreted as a link between genes and the final behavior, acted on by the environment <b>and</b> <b>chance</b> elements, with biochemical and epigenetic influences changing the genome but not being passed on to children. Molecular-biological studies in genetics have referred to endophenotypes to explain genetic causes of psychopathology. The researchers also examined how schizoids, those with mild, schizophrenia-like personality disorders, were linked to schizophrenics. Gottesman and Shields extended the term to classes of mild psychological disorders in twins and relatives of schizophrenics. The researchers had hypothesized that schizoida in a twin was how a schizophrenia carrier gene, one in a non-schizophrenic still passing on a genetic risk, expressed itself. The twin study did not confirm this.|$|E
