30|$|This report {{described}} a novel, sensitive, and widely <b>applicable</b> <b>detection</b> <b>method</b> using copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs)/MWNTs/GCE. This modification with Cu NPs and MWNTs improved {{the sensitivity of}} the nicotine determination by reducing the over potential and increasing the current. Experimental parameters affecting the sensor response, such as pH, concentration of MWNT suspension, electro-deposition scan rate, were studied and optimized at 7.0, 2  mg mL− 1, and 80  mV s− 1, respectively. SEM images showed good dispersion of copper nanoparticles over CNT surface. The electrode exhibited a high catalytic activity toward the oxidation of nicotine with a slope calibration curve of 1.121  µA/mM in the range from 1  ×  10 − 6  M to 9  ×  10 − 5  M and another slope curve of 0.164 in the range from 1  ×  10 − 4 to 1  ×  10 − 3 M. The sensor displayed a good response to nicotine with a LOD of 1  µM. These results suggest that carbon nanotubes and copper nanoparticles are effective modifiers to enhance the sensitivity of glassy carbon electrode. It was observed that MWNTs and Cu NPs could facilitate the exchange of electrons with the electrode.|$|R
40|$|Several {{molecular}} {{methods have}} been developed for the detection of Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of fire blight in pear and apple, but none are truly applicable for on-site use in the field. We developed a fast, reliable and field <b>applicable</b> <b>detection</b> <b>method</b> using a novel target on the E. amylovora chromosome that we identified by applying a comparative genomic pipeline. The target coding sequences (CDSs) are both uniquely specific for and all-inclusive of E. amylovora genotypes. This avoids potential false negatives that can occur with most commonly used methods based on amplification of plasmid gene targets, which can vary among strains. Loop-mediated isothermal AMPlification (LAMP) with OptiGene Genie II chemistry and instrumentation proved to be an exceptionally rapid (under 15 min) and robust method for detecting E. amylovora in orchards, as well as simple to use in the plant diagnostic laboratory. Comparative validation results using plant samples from inoculated greenhouse trials and from natural field infections (of regional and temporal diverse origin) showed that our LAMP had an equivalent or greater performance regarding sensitivity, specificity, speed and simplicity than real-time PCR (TaqMan), other LAMP assays, immunoassays and plating, demonstrating its utility for routine testing...|$|R
40|$|PCR has revolutionised {{our ability}} to type for Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) but most <b>detection</b> <b>methods</b> to date have relied {{on the use of}} gels. Therefore, there is a {{requirement}} for a technique that would lend itself to automation and allow high throughput screening. AMDI (Alkaline Mediated Differential Interaction) is just such a system. It is a simple, inexpensive and effective way of detecting PCR product without the need for gels. AMDI makes use of the fluorescent properties of the dye SYBR-green 1. Under specialised conditions the dye binds to the PCR product, producing fluorescence detectable by fluorimeter. Previous attempts to use such dyes for this purpose have failed due to the high background fluorescence caused by reactants in the PCR. Using the commercially available buffer CABS (4 -[cyclohexylamino]- 1 -butanesulphonic acid) the pH of the completed PCR can be increased at the time of reading, maintaining the fluorescence of the bound product while limiting that of the background. The difference in fluorescence between a positive and negative reaction is at least three fold. This system has been developed for HLA Class II, HLA Class I, Y chromosome and APC SNP typing. The HLA reactions have been validated using well characterised lymphoblastoid cell lines and we are now applying the AMDI system to the HLA typing of a number of populations. This widely <b>applicable</b> <b>detection</b> <b>method</b> is inexpensive, simple, robust and ultimately automatable. © 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd,...|$|R

To date, no generally <b>applicable</b> fluorescence-based <b>detection</b> <b>method</b> has been developed because commercially available doubly-labeled substrates are not always digested by exopeptidases. In this article we present a new method for the sensitive detection of exopeptidases based on fluorescently-labeled substrates containing only one fluorophore that is efficiently quenched by an adjacent tryptophan residue via photoinduced electron transfer. Because of their well-known properties we chose carboxypeptidase A (CPA) as a model system. The self-quenching probes were used in homogeneous solution {{as well as on}} cross-linked PEG-coated surfaces in combination with single-molecule imaging techniques.

40|$|While the {{development}} and application of capillary electrophoresis (CE) has matured significantly {{in the last two}} decades, its application to trace analysis has been limited by The lack of a generally <b>applicable,</b> Sensitive <b>detection</b> <b>method.</b> This Ph. D. project's aim was to develop such a <b>method</b> using electrochemical <b>detection.</b> After an initial review of the work done in electrochemical detection (ECD) for CE, it was determined that of the system that had been report most had significant limitations for practical use. These systems were typically fragile and difficult to construct and were applicable to only electrochemically active analytes. Given this, a simplified and more robust CE-ECD instrumentation system was developed. Using this instrumentation, an ECD system based on square-wave voltammetry was developed (CE-SWV). Detection limits obtained with CE-SWV for neurotransmitters (150 nM, S/N = 3) were comparable to those obtained using more fragile and complex amperometric CE detection systems. While CE-SWV worked well for detection of electroactive analytes (redox processes), {{one of the reasons for}} investigating SWV was to determine whether it could detect other electrode processes such as analyte adsorption to develop a more generally <b>applicable</b> CE <b>detection</b> <b>method.</b> Using SWV, changes in the background electrolyte response were observed as organic analytes exited the capillary and interacted with a Pt electrode. Initially, for non-aromatic analytes, these changes appeared to result from physical adsorption of the analyte which "blocked" the hydrogen adsorption/reduction normally observed and produced negative electropherogram peaks. Using this as a <b>detection</b> <b>method,</b> reasonable <b>detection</b> limits (~ 1 [mu]M, SN = 3) were obtained for analytes that did not have UV-chromophores. When this <b>detection</b> <b>method</b> was applied to analytes with [pi]-electron density (i. e. analytes with phenyl or carbonyl functionality), positive SWV responses were observed, indicating an additional chemisorption process was involved. Positive voltage pulses (400 mV for 5 ms) applied before the SWV scan were found to be necessary to elicit this positive response. It appeared that these positive voltage pulses oxidized the Pt electrode, possibly creating a reactive Pt-OH layer which catalyzed oxidation of these organic analytes which were then reduced during the negative-going SWV scan used. These positive voltage pulses also served to maintain a clean electrode surface to prevent electrode fouling [...] a common problem encountered in ECD techniques. This positive SW response, when plotted versus migration time, resulted in detection limits (5 nM, S/N = 3) over an order of magnitude better than UV detection for analytes, with good UV chromophores. This <b>detection</b> <b>method,</b> termed adsorption-based electrochemical detection (AdsECD), was demonstrated to be applicable to a wide variety of important organic analytes (over 50 organic analytes previously considered to be electrochemically inactive were detected) separated by CE using a variety of separation systems (i. e. separation systems with varied pH, ionic strength, micellar systems, added organic solvents and chiral selectors were investigated). Coupled with the rugged and easy-to-use CE-ECD instrumentation that was developed, AdsECD was shown to be a technique that should prove to be useful for a wide variety of practical chemical analysis problems...|$|R

40|$|On {{paper and}} pencil {{multiple}} choice tests, the potential for examinees to mark their answers in incorrect locations presents {{a serious threat to}} the validity of test score interpretations. When an examinee skips one or more items (i. e., answers out of sequence) but fails to accurately reflect the size of that skip on their answer sheet, that can trigger a string of misaligned responses called shift errors. Shift errors can result in correct answers being marked as incorrect, leading to possible underestimation of an examinee 2 ̆ 7 s true ability. Despite movement toward computerized testing in recent years, {{paper and pencil}} multiple choice tests are still pervasive in many high stakes assessment settings, including K 12 testing (e. g., MCAS) and college entrance exams (e. g., SAT), leaving a continuing need to address issues that arise within this format. ^ Techniques for detecting aberrant response patterns are well established but do little to recognize reasons for the aberrance, limiting options for addressing the misfitting patterns. While some work has been done to detect and address specific forms of aberrant response behavior, little has been done in the area of shift error detection, leaving great room for improvement in addressing this source of aberrance. The opportunity to accurately detect construct irrelevant errors and either adjust scores to more accurately reflect examinee ability or flag examinees with inaccurate scores for removal from the dataset and retesting would improve the validity of important decisions based on test scores, and could positively impact model fit by allowing for more accurate item parameter and ability estimation. ^ The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate new algorithms for shift error detection that employ IRT models for probabilistic determination as to whether misfitting patterns are likely to be shift errors. The study examines a matrix of detection algorithms, probabilistic models, and person parameter methods, testing combinations of these factors for their selectivity (i. e., true positives vs. false positives), sensitivity (i. e., true shift errors detected vs. undetected), and robustness to parameter bias, all under a carefully manipulated, multifaceted simulation environment. This investigation attempts to provide answers to the following questions, <b>applicable</b> across <b>detection</b> <b>methods,</b> bias reduction procedures, shift conditions, and ability levels, but stated generally as: 1) How sensitively and selectively can an IRT based probabilistic model detect shift error across the full range of probabilities under specific conditions?, 2) How robust is each <b>detection</b> <b>method</b> to the parameter bias introduced by shift error?, 3) How well does the <b>detection</b> <b>method</b> detect shift errors compared to other, more general, indices of person fit?, 4) What is the impact on bias of making proposed corrections to detected shift errors?, and 4) To what extent does shift error, as detected by the method, occur within an empirical data set? ^ Results show that the proposed methods can indeed detect shift errors at reasonably high detection rates with only a minimal number of false positives, that detection improves when detecting longer shift errors, and that examinee ability is a huge determinant factor in the effectiveness of the shift error detection techniques. Though some detection ability is lost to person parameter bias, when detecting all but the shortest shift errors, this loss is minimal. Application to empirical data also proved effective, though some discrepancies in projected total counts suggest that refinements in the technique are required. Use of a person fit statistic to detect examinees with shift errors was shown to be completely ineffective, underscoring the value of shift error specific <b>detection</b> <b>methods.</b> ...|$|R

More speciﬁcally, many stiction <b>detection</b> <b>methods</b> assume persistency of the oscillation pattern in the control loop signals, which {{is a necessary}} condition to achieve reliable detection results.

The generalized <b>detection</b> <b>methods</b> developed here can be implemented in an efficient way such that experimental real time state discrimination with improved fidelity is possible.
