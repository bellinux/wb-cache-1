25|$|The FBI and CDC {{investigation}} has been {{hampered by the}} destruction of a large collection of <b>anthrax</b> <b>spores</b> collected over more than seven decades and kept in more than 100 vials at Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa. Many scientists claim that the quick destruction of the <b>anthrax</b> <b>spores</b> collection in Iowa eliminated crucial evidence useful for the investigation. A precise match between the strain of anthrax used in the attacks and a strain in the collection would have offered hints as to when bacteria had been isolated and, perhaps, as to how widely it had been distributed to researchers. Such genetic clues could have given investigators the evidence necessary to identify the perpetrators.|$|E

25|$|When the USA {{entered the}} war, Allied {{resources}} were pooled {{at the request}} of the British and the U.S. established a large research program and industrial complex at Fort Detrick, Maryland in 1942 under the direction of George W. Merck. The biological and chemical weapons developed during that period were tested at the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah.

25|$|During {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} conflict, the Rhodesian {{government}} resorted to biological warfare. Watercourses at several sites close to the Mozambique border were deliberately contaminated with cholera and the toxin Sodium Coumadin, an anti-coagulant commonly used as the active ingredient in rat poison. Food stocks in the area were contaminated with <b>anthrax</b> <b>spores.</b> These biological attacks had little impact on the fighting capability of ZANLA, but caused considerable distress to the local population. Over 10,000 people contracted anthrax in the period 1978 to 1980, of whom 200 died. The facts about this episode became known during the hearings of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission during the late 1990s.|$|E
40|$|We {{determined}} the genotypes of seven Bacillus anthracis strains that were recovered from nine anthrax outbreaks in North-East China from 2010 to 2014, and two approved vaccine strains {{that are currently}} in use in China. The causes of these cases were partly due to local farmers being unaware {{of the presence of}} anthrax, and butchers with open wounds having direct contact with anthrax-contaminated meat products. The genotype of five of the seven recovered strains was A. Br. 001 / 002 sub-lineage, which was concordant with previously published research. The remaining two cases belongs to the A. Br. Ames sub-lineage. Both of these strains displayed an identical SNR pattern, which {{was the first time that}} this genotype was identified in North-East China. Strengthening education in remote villages of rural China is an important activity aimed at fostering attempts to prevent and control anthrax.

The United Kingdom suffered its worst air pollution event when the December 4 Great Smog of 1952 formed over London. In six days more than 4,000 died and more recent estimates put the figure at nearer 12,000. An accidental leak of <b>anthrax</b> <b>spores</b> from a biological warfare laboratory in the former USSR in 1979 near Sverdlovsk {{is believed to have}} caused at least 64 deaths.

25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, {{historian}} Norman Cantor, in In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World It Made (2001), suggests the Black Death {{might have been}} a combination of pandemics including a form of anthrax, a cattle murrain. He cites many forms of evidence including: reported disease symptoms not in keeping with the known effects of either bubonic or pneumonic plague, the discovery of <b>anthrax</b> <b>spores</b> in a plague pit in Scotland, and the fact that meat from infected cattle was known to have been sold in many rural English areas prior to the onset of the plague. The means of infection varied widely, with infection in the absence of living or recently dead humans in Sicily (which speaks against most viruses). Also, diseases with similar symptoms were generally not distinguished between in that period (see murrain above), {{at least not in the}} Christian world; Chinese and Muslim medical records can be expected to yield better information which however only pertains to the specific disease(s) which affected these areas.|$|E
25|$|Dozens of {{buildings}} were contaminated with anthrax {{as a result}} of the mailings. The companies in charge of the clean up and decontaminating of the buildings was Bio Recovery Corporation of Woodside, New York and Bio-Recovery Services of America, based in Ohio. The decontaminating of <b>anthrax</b> <b>spores</b> in the building located in midtown Manhattan, is part of Rockefeller Center on the Avenue of Americas. It is home to the New York Post and Fox News, among others. Bio Recovery Corporation provided the labor and equipment, such as HEPA filtered negative pressure air scrubbers, HEPA vacuums, respirators, cyclone foggers, and decontamination foam licensed by the Sandia National Laboratories. Bio Recovery Corporation also received gratitude from New York City Mayor, Rudy Giuliani. Bio Recovery Corporation removed 93 bags of anthrax-contaminated mail at the New York Post alone. The decontamination of the Brentwood postal facility took 26 months and cost $130 million. The Hamilton, New Jersey postal facility remained closed until March 2005; its cleanup cost $65million. The United States Environmental Protection Agency spent $41.7million to clean up government buildings in Washington, D.C. One FBI document said the total damage exceeded $1billion.|$|E
40|$|Every {{bacteriologist}} {{will agree}} that the proof of the spore lies in its resistance.

Using a local, virulent strain of B. anthracis, we performed a field experiment in an enclosure within a grassland savanna. We found that B. anthracis increased the rate of establishment of a native grass (Enneapogon desvauxii) by 50 % and that grass seeds exposed to blood reached heights that were 45 % taller than controls. Further we detected significant effects of E. desvauxii, B. anthracis, and their interaction on soil bacterial taxa richness and community composition.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{this work}} are {{reported}} {{the results of}} a qualitative analytical method capable of detecting Bacillus anthracis spores when they are present in very low concentration in the soil. The Ground Anthrax Bacillus Refined Isolation (GABRI) method, assessed in our laboratory, was compared with the classic method. The comparison involved artificially anthrax-contaminated soil samples (500 spores/ 7. 5 grams soil) and naturally contaminated soil samples collected in Bangladesh during a field investigation. RESULTS: The results indicated that, in contrast to the classic method, the GABRI method was able to detect B. anthracis in all contaminated samples. The GABRI method produces a more sensitive measure of <b>anthrax</b> <b>spore</b> presence significantly different from the standard method. In particular, the latter is more sensitive to the presence of normal soil contaminants. CONCLUSION: The main feature of the GABRI method is its ability to strongly reduce the presence of the environmental contaminants which being much more numerous than B. anthracis tend to inhibit their germination and growth making it extremely difficult to visualize any colonies. The reduction of the microbial environment also allows one to be able to culture and test a larger quantity of potentially contaminated soil and to isolate B. anthracis when the spores are present in very low concentrations in the soil...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} for the isolation and detection of Bacillus anthracis spores from soil collected from Sirajganj district (a north-western district of Bangladesh), and to assess the parameters that may relate to the repeated anthrax outbreak. A total of 48 soil samples were collected from the study area during January to November 2012. Endospores were extracted from soil and the Bacillus anthracis was identified using conventional bacteriological, biochemical and sensitivity test against Penicillin-G. The viable B. anthracis spores could be detected from 14 (29. 17 %) soil samples. Moisture content, pH, calcium and organic carbon contents of the soils were measured and {{the values of the}} endospore positive samples ranged from 6. 31 - 28. 37 %, 5. 17 - 7. 22, 484. 35 - 1372. 35 ppm and 0. 15 - 2. 35 %, respectively. All the endospore positive soil samples were of loamy type, while none of the clay type soil was found to be positive for B. anthracis, suggesting the influence of soil type on the occurrence of anthrax endospore in studied area. The mean pH of anthrax positive soil was weakly acidic (6. 38 ± 0. 15), indicating that a suitable pH range for <b>anthrax</b> <b>spore</b> was present in the soil of Sirajganj.

Most disinfectants such as household cleaning products, alcohols, quaternary ammonium compounds and detergents have little effect on endospores. However, sterilant alkylating agents (e.g. ethylene oxide), and 10% bleach are effective against endospores. To kill most <b>anthrax</b> <b>spores,</b> standard household bleach (with 10% sodium hypochlorite) must be in contact with the spores for at least several minutes; a very small proportion of spores can survive longer than 10 minutes in such a solution.

40|$|The {{health and}} {{economic}} burden {{of infectious diseases}} in general and bioterrorism in particular necessitate the development of medical countermeasures. One proven approach to reduce the disease burden and spread of pathogen is treatment with monoclonal antibodies (mAb). mAbs can prevent or reduce severity of the disease by variety of mechanisms, including neutralizing pathogen growth, limiting its spread from infected to adjacent cells, or by inhibiting biological activity of toxins, such as anthrax lethal toxin. Here, we report the production of glycosylated (pp-mAb (PA)) and non-glycosylated (pp-mAb (PANG)) versions of a plant-derived mAb directed against protective antigen (PA) of Bacillus anthracis in Nicotiana benthamiana plants using agroinfiltration. Both forms of the antibody were able to neutralize anthrax lethal toxin activity in vitro and protect mice against an intraperitoneal challenge with spores of B. anthracis Sterne strain. A single 180 µg intraperitoneal dose of pp-mAb (PA) or pp-mAb (PANG) provided 90 % and 100 % survival, respectively. When tested in non-human primates, pp-mAb (PANG) was demonstrated to be superior to pp-mAb (PA) in {{that it had a}} significantly longer terminal half-life and conferred 100 % protection against a lethal dose of aerosolized <b>anthrax</b> <b>spore</b> challenge after a single 5 mg/kg intravenous dose compared to a 40 % survival rate conferred by pp-mAb (PA).

The {{goal of the}} present study is to identify linear B-cell epitopes of EF and to determine the relative contributions of cross-reactive antibodies of EF and LF to LeTx and EdTx neutralization. A/J mice were immunized with recombinant LF (rLF) or rEF. Pools of LF or EF immune sera were tested for reactivity to rLF or rEF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, in vitro neutralization of LeTx and EdTx, and binding to solid-phase LF and EF decapeptides. Cross-reactive antibodies were isolated by column absorption of EF-binding antibodies from LF immune sera and by column absorption of LF-binding antibodies from EF immune sera. The resulting fractions were subjected to the same assays. Major cross-reactive epitopes were identified as EF amino acids (aa) 257 to 268 and LF aa 265 to 274. Whole LF and EF immune sera neutralized LeTx and EdTx, respectively. However, LF sera did not neutralize EdTx, nor did EF sera neutralize LeTx.

Cross-reactive B-cell epitopes in the PA-binding domains of whole rLF and rEF occur and have been identified; however, the major anthrax toxin-neutralizing humoral responses to these antigens are constituted by non-cross-reactive epitopes.
