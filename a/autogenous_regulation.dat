40|$|<b>Autogenous</b> <b>{{regulation}}</b> is {{the regulation}} of expression of a structural gene by the product of that gene. Hence, autoge-nously regulated proteins control the rate of their own synthesis. By definition, <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> involves direct control of {{the expression of a}} gene by its product. This must be distinguished from indirect control of gene expres-sion (for example, through changes in the concentration of a metabolite that influences another regulatory protein by affecting the transport or metabolism of an inducer or corepressor) (33). Many transcription factors regulate their own expression. Such <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> is not surprising, since the primary function of these proteins is to bind DNA to regulate expression of other genes.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model based on equilibrium binding between Gal 14 p and its specific DNA binding site has been developed. A model for GAL, gene expression solely due to cooperativity, {{as a function}} of Ga 14 p concentration, has been developed for a gal 80 mutant. The above model was extended to include other known regulatory molecules, namely Gal 80 p and Gal 3 p. Parameters determined from the above simulation were then used to represent a physiological status of gene expression in response to glucose (in terms of Gal 4 p concentration) and galactose in a wild-type strain. We demonstrate that in a wild-type strain glucose repression is more stringent due to cooperativity and <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation,</b> while the induction response to galactose is only through <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation.</b> The biological significance of <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is discussed vis-a-vis the lactose operon of Escherichia coli...|$|E
40|$|From {{nucleotide}} sequencing analyses, the A. caulinodans nifA gene {{seems to be}} under dual control by the Ntr (in response to available N) and Fnr (in response to available O 2) transcriptional activation/repression systems. Because it fixes N 2 in two contexts, the Ntr system might regulate A. caulinodans nif gene expression ex planta, while the Fnr system might similarly regulate in planta. As nifA upstream-activating elements, we have identified: (i) a gpNifA binding site allowing <b>autogenous</b> nifA <b>regulation,</b> (ii) an Ntr-dependent transcription start, presumably the target of gpNifA activation, and (iii) an "anaerobox" tetradecameric nucleotide sequence that is precisely conserved among O 2 regulated enteric bacterial genes controlled by the gpFnr transcriptional activator. Because it is precisely positioned upstream of enteric bacterial transcriptional starts, the "anaerobox" sequence may constitute the gpFnr DNA binding site. If so, then a second, Ntr-independent nifA transcription start may exist. We have also deduced the A. caulinodans nifA open reading frame and have compared the gene product (gpNifA) {{with those of other}} N 2 -fixing organisms. These proteins exhibit strongly conserved motifs: (i) sites conserved among ATP-binding proteins, (ii) an interdomain linker region, and (iii) a C-terminal alpha-helix-turn-alpha-helix DNA binding site...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Coiled {{bodies are}} nuclear organelles {{that are highly}} enriched in small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and certain basal {{transcription}} factors. Surprisingly, coiled bodies not only contain mature U snRNPs but also associate with specific chromosomal loci, including gene clusters that encode U snRNAs and histone messenger RNAs. The mechanism(s) by which coiled bodies associate with these genes is completely unknown. Results: Using stable cell lines, we show that artificial tandem arrays of human U 1 and U 2 snRNA genes colocalize with coiled bodies and that {{the frequency of the}} colocalization depends directly on the transcriptional activity of the array. Association of the genes with coiled bodies was abolished when the artificial U 2 arrays contained promoter mutations that prevent transcription or when RNA polymerase II transcription was globally inhibited by Î±-amanitin. Remarkably, the association was also abolished when the U 2 snRNA coding regions were replaced by heterologous sequences. Conclusions: The requirement for the U 2 snRNA coding region indicates that association of snRNA genes with coiled bodies is mediated by the nascent U 2 RNA itself, not by DNA or DNA-bound proteins. Our data provide the first evidence that association of genes with a nuclear organelle can be directed by an RNA and suggest an <b>autogenous</b> feedback <b>regulation</b> model...|$|R
40|$|The {{gene for}} ribosomal protein MvaL 1 from the arachaebacterium Methanococcus vannielii was cloned and characterized. It is {{clustered}} {{together with the}} genes for MvaL 10 and MvaL 12, thus is organized {{in the same order}} as in E. coli and other archaebacteria. Unexpectedly, analysis of the sequence in front of the MvaL 1 gene revealed an ORF of unknown identity, whereas in E. coli, Halobacterium and Sulfolobus solfataricus the gene for the L 11 equivalent protein is located in this position. Northern blot analysis revealed a single tricistronic transcript encoding proteins MvaL 1, MvaL 10 and MvaL 12. The 5 '-end of the MvaL 1 -L 10 -L 12 transcript contains a region that has a sequence and structure almost identical to a region on the 23 S rRNA which is the putative binding domain for MvaL 1, and is highly similar to the E. coli L 11 -L 1 mRNA leader sequence that has been implicated in <b>autogenous</b> translational <b>regulation.</b> Amino acid sequence comparison revealed that MvaL 1 shares 30. 5 % identity with ribosomal protein L 1 from E. coli and 41. 5 % and 33. 3 % identity with the L 1 -equivalent proteins from the archaebacteria H. cutirubrum and S. solfataricus respectively...|$|R

The ribosomal protein genes are clustered {{in the same order}} as that in E. coli although the transcription pattern differs. Transcripts characterized include (i) abundant monocistronic L 11 e and tricistronic L 1 e-L 10 e-L 12 e transcripts; (ii) less abundant bicistronic NAB-L 11 e and monocistronic NAB transcripts and (iii) a very rare ORF monocistronic transcript.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{summarize}} {{a series of}} thermodynamic, and preliminary kinetic, studies on the molecular details and specificity of interaction of phage T 4 -coded gene 32 -protein (GP 32) with nucleic acid lattices. It is shown that the binding of GP 32 to short (l = 2 [...] 8 residues) oligonucleotides is essentially independent of base composition and sugar-type, {{as well as of}} salt concentration. In contrast, cooperative (continuous) or isolated binding of GP 32 to single-stranded polynucleotides is base and sugar composition-dependent (binding is tighter to DNA than to RNA) and highly dependent on salt concentrations. Binding constants (K), cooperativity parameters (w), and binding site sizes (n) are determined for binding to various nucleic acid lattices under a variety of environmental conditions. These results are used to show that GP 32 can bind to nucleic acid lattices in two different conformations, and to characterize the molecular details of these binding species. Further insight into the molecular origins of binding cooperativity is obtained by determining these thermodynamic parameters also for the specifically proteolytically degraded GP 32 fragments GP 32 I (C-terminal peptide removed) and GP 32 III (C- and N-terminal peptides removed). It is also shown that these GP 32 -nucleic acid binding measurements can be used to provide a quantitative molecular interpretation of the sequential (competitive) binding equilibria involved in the <b>autogenous</b> translational <b>regulation</b> of GP 32 synthesis (Lemaire et al., 1978, J. Mol. Biol. 126 : 73, 1978), and to illustrate some general principles of the development of interactional specificity in cooperatively binding protein-nucleic acid complexes. Preliminary experiments have also been carried out on the kinetics of GP 32 association to, and dissociation from, single-stranded nucleic acid lattices. In particular, fluorescence stopped-flow measurements of the dissociation of GP 32 from such lattices as a function of lattice saturation (and protein cluster size) can be interpreted to suggest that the protein may translocate ("slide") on the lattice before dissociation, These studies permit an approach to possible rates and mechanisms of such translocation events...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen-catabolic gene {{expression}} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is {{regulated by the}} action of four GATA family transcription factors: Gln 3 p and Gat 1 p/Nil 1 p are transcriptional activators, and Dal 80 and Deh 1 p/Gzf 3 p are repressors. In addition to the GATA sequences situated upstream of all nitrogen catabolite repression-sensitive genes that encode enzyme and transport proteins, the promoters of the GAT 1, DAL 80, and DEH 1 genes all contain multiple GATA sequences as well. These GATA sequences are the binding sites of the GATA family transcription factors and are hypothesized to mediate their <b>autogenous</b> and cross <b>regulation.</b> Here we show, using DAL 80 fused to the carbon-regulated GAL 1, 10 or copper-regulated CUP 1 promoter, that GAT 1 expression is inversely regulated by the level of DAL 80 expression, i. e., as DAL 80 expression increases, GAT 1 expression decreases. The amount of DAL 80 expression also dictates the level at which DAL 3, a gene activated almost exclusively by Gln 3 p, is transcribed. Gat 1 p was found to partially substitute for Gln 3 p in transcription. These data support the contention that regulation of GATA-factor {{gene expression}} is tightly and dynamically coupled. Finally, we suggest that the complicated regulatory circuit in which the GATA family transcription factors participate is probably most beneficial as cells make the transition from excess to limited nitrogen availability...|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{accumulation}} of each ribosomal protein is carefully {{regulated by the}} yeast cell to provide the equimolar ratio necessary for the assembly of the ribosome. The mechanisms responsible for this regulation have been examined by introducing into the yeast cell extra copies of seven individual ribosomal protein genes carried on autonomously replicating plasmids. In each case studied the plasmid-borne gene was transcribed {{to the same degree}} as the genomic gene. Nevertheless, the cell maintained a balanced {{accumulation of}} ribosomal proteins, using a variety of methods other than transcription. (i) Several ribosomal proteins were synthesized in substantial excess. However, the excess ribosomal protein was rapidly degraded. (ii) The excess mRNA for two of the ribosomal protein genes was translated inefficiently. We provide evidence that this was due to inefficient initiation of translation. (iii) The transcripts derived from two of the ribosomal protein genes were spliced inefficiently, leading to an accumulation of precursor RNA. We present a model which proposes the <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of mRNA splicing as a eucaryotic parallel of the <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of mRNA translation in procaryotes. Finally, the accumulation of each ribosomal protein was regulated independently.

40|$|The {{level of}} 6 -phosphogluconate {{dehydrogenase}} is {{positively correlated with}} the cellular growth rate. To determine whether growth rate-dependent regulation of expression of gnd, which encodes this enzyme, is carried out by a transcriptional mechanism, the structural genes of the lactose operon were fused to and brought {{under the control of}} the gnd promoter through the use of phage Mu d 1 (Apr lac). Four independent gnd::Mu d 1 (Apr lac) operon fusion strains were isolated. After the Mu d 1 prophage was replaced with lambda p 1 (209), Lac+ specialized transducing phages carrying the gnd-lac fusions were prepared. These phages were used to demonstrate that the lac genes were fused to the gnd promoter by crossing them with gnd promoter deletion mutants and with polar phage Mu cts-induced gnd mutants. A genetic map of the fusion joints was deduced. The level of beta-galactosidase in each fusion strain was the same in cells growing on acetate as in cells growing on glucose (with specific growth rate constants of 0. 1 and 0. 55 h- 1, respectively) and was unaffected by the presence of a gnd+ gene in trans.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} {{the role of}} time delay in several differential-delay equation focusing on the negative <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation.</b> We study these models for little or no delay to when the model has a very large delay parameter. We start with the logistic differential-delay equation applying techniques {{that would be used}} in subsequent chapters for other models being studied. A key goal of this research is to identify where the structure of the system does change. First, {{we investigate}} these models for critical point and study their behaviour close to these points. Of keen interest is the Hopf bifurcation points where we analyse the parameter associated with the Hopf point. The weakly nonlinear analysis carried out using the method of multiple time scale is used to give more insight to these model. The centre manifold method is shown to support the result derived using the multiple time scale. Then the second study carried out is the study of the transition from a sinelike wave to a square wave. This is analysed and a scale deduced at which this transition gradually takes place. One of the key areas we focused on in the large delay is to solve for a certain constant a' associated with the period of oscillation. The effect of the delayed parameter is shown throughout this thesis as a major contributor to the properties of both the logistic delay and the negative <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Two {{distinct}} mRNA transcripts were synthesized in Escherichia coli during {{expression of}} FSendA, an endoglucanase gene from Fibrobacter succinogenes AR 1. Expression of FSendA required a ribosomal frameshift between {{open reading frame}} 1 (ORF 1) and ORF 2 to allow contiguous translation of a 453 amino acid protein (1). The primary transcript initiated upstream of ORF 1 and the secondary transcript from within ORF 1. Both transcripts terminated downstream of ORF 2 and termination was essential for endoglucanase expression. Deletion of the primary transcript promoter region allowed read-through of the secondary transcript beyond the terminator region, indicating that {{a component of the}} intact FSendA gene allowed efficient transcription termination.

This "autogenous regulation hypothesis" has recently shown to be erroneous, in the very organism for which it was first proposed. Nevertheless this erroneous hypothesis have led to a thorough dissection of the process of regulation of nitrate assimilation and more importantly to a hypothesis bearing on the origin of metabolite-responsive transcription factors.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{regulation}} of ribosomal protein (r-protein) synthesis in Xenopus anucleolate mutants, which lack the genes for rRNA. The accumulation of mRNA for the two r-proteins analyzed parallels the controls up to stage 30. This mRNA is mobilized onto polysomes and is translated as in normal embryos, but r-proteins are unstable {{in the absence of}} rRNA to assemble with. A translational control of rp-mRNA distribution between polysomes and mRNPs is observed, but this is not due to an <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> by r-proteins. After stage 30 the amount of rp-mRNA declines specifically in the mutants because the transcripts are unstable. Considering the temporal correlation between this event and the onset of r-protein synthesis we suggest that an autogenous control operates at the level of transcript stability...|$|E

A new model, compatible with the subcloning data, is proposed.

The lon (capR) gene deoxyribonucleic acid was cloned {{from a new}} Fâ² factor. The new plasmids, designated pBZ 201 and pBZ 203, (i) contained an additional 8. 2 -megadalton (Md) EcoRI fragment that had the same mobility {{as one of the}} EcoRI fragments of the Fâ², and (ii) conferred repression of capsular polysaccharide synthesis and repression of sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation in a bacterial transformation experiment with capR mutant recipient strains. A capR 9 mutant plasmid, pBZ 201 M 9, was also isolated and conferred expression of mucoidy and ultraviolet sensitivity to a capR+ (lon+) strain, indicating that the capR 9 allele was dominant. Plasmids pBZ 201 M 80, pBZ 201 M 9 -INSA, and pBZ 201 M 9 -INSB were characterized by transformation as containing recessive capR mutant alleles. Heteroduplex analyses and agarose gel electrophoresis of restriction endonuclease digests of plasmid DNA preparations revealed that (i) pBZ 201 M 9 -INSA and pBZ 201 M 9 -INSB each contains a 0. 5 -Md insertion (probably IS 1) in the cloned DNA fragment at the same site, and (ii) pBZ 201 and pBZ 203, both capR+ plasmids, contain the same 8. 2 -Md fragment cloned in opposite orientations with respect to the cloning vehicle, pSC 101. Plasmid-specified polypeptides were determined by using strain CSR 603 maxicells containing each plasmid. Two new polypeptides were coded by the lon+ (capR+) 8. 2 -Md DNA fragment: Z 1, 94 kilodaltons (94 K), and Z 2, 67 K. The maxicells containing recessive capR mutant plasmids were deficient only in synthesis of the 94 K polypeptide, and the dominant (capR 9) mutant plasmid specified 5 to 10 times more of the 94 K polypeptide than the maxicells containing the capR+ plasmid. Other data indicated that the capR 9 -specified â 94 K polypeptideâ was not identical to the capR+-specified â 94 K polypeptide. â Thus the altered mutant polypeptide was synthesized in increased quantities, suggesting a defective mode of <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> for the capR 9 polypeptide and effective <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of the capR+ polypeptide...|$|E
40|$|Yra 1 p is an {{essential}} RNA-binding protein that couples transcription to export. The YRA 1 gene {{is one of only}} â¼ 5 % of genes that undergo splicing in budding yeast, and its intron is unusual in several respects, including its large size and anomalous branchpoint sequence. We showed previously that the intron is required for <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of Yra 1 p levels, which cause a dominant negative growth phenotype when elevated. The mechanism of this regulation, however, remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that growth is inversely correlated with splicing efficiency. Substitution of a canonical branchpoint moderately improves splicing but compromises autoregulation. Shortening the intron from 766 to â¼ 350 nt significantly improves splicing but abolishes autoregulation. Notably, proper regulation can be restored by insertion of unrelated sequences into the shortened intron. In that the current paradigm for regulated splicing involves the binding of protein factors to specific elements in the pre-mRNA, the regulation of YRA 1 expression appears to occur by a novel mechanism. We propose that appropriate levels of Yra 1 p are maintained by inefficient cotranscriptional splicing...|$|E

40|$|Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L 4 has two functions: it is a {{structural}} {{component of the}} 50 S ribosomal sub-unit {{and it is a}} repressor of both transcription and translation of its own transcription unit, the 11 -gene S 10 operon. Genetic and biochemical studies have suggested that L 4 can interact with 23 S rRNA as well as with both RNA interactions. However, no significant similarities between its two RNA targets {{can be found at the}} primary or secondary structure level. To test if identical determinants of L 4 are involved in both ribosome assembly and autogenous control, we have isolated L 4 mutants defective in either of these functions and asked if a mutant protein divested of one function is also deficient in the other. Several mutations eliminated autogenous control, but still allowed assembly of the mutant L 4 protein into functional ribosomes. Conversely, several mutant L 4 proteins that could not be detected in 50 S subunits nevertheless could regulate expression of the S 10 operon.

40|$|The {{cytosine}} analog 5 -azacytidine kills Escherichia coli {{cells that}} carry plasmids expressing EcoRII DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase under {{control of its}} own promoter. We previously showed that this enzyme binds tightly to azacytidine-containing DNA in vitro and proposed that such binding is lethal in vivo. In support of this proposal, we now show that the enzyme sediments with the nucleoid of azacytidine-treated cells. Azacytidine treatment led {{to an increase in}} the amount of enzyme, and this increase required sequences in the ecoRIIM promoter region. Enzyme inducibility correlated with drug sensitivity: plasmids carrying the methyltransferase gene but lacking the wild-type promoter did not confer sensitivity. These results suggested that the ecoRIIM gene was under autogenous control. Transcriptional ecoRIIM'-lacZ fusions in E. coli were, therefore, constructed. They showed that expression from the ecoRIIM promoter was inhibited when EcoRII DNA (cytosine- 5) methyltransferase was introduced into the cell in trans and inhibition was reversed by treating the cells with azacytidine. These results provide evidence that the expression of the ecoRIIM gene is under <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> and that cell death induced by azacytidine is due, in part, to the disruption of autoregulation...|$|E
40|$|Polynucleotide {{phosphorylase}} (PNPase), a 3 â² to 5 â² exonuclease encoded by pnp, plays a {{key role}} in Escherichia coli RNA decay. The enzyme, made of three identical 711 amino acid subunits, may also be assembled in the RNA degradosome, a heteromultimeric complex involved in RNA degradation. PNPase autogenously regulates its expression by promoting the decay of pnp mRNA, supposedly by binding at the 5 â²-untranslated leader region of an RNase III-processed form of this transcript. The KH and S 1 RNA-binding domains at the C-terminus of the protein (amino acids 552 â 711) are thought to be involved in pnp mRNA recognition. Here we show that a G 454 D substitution in E. coli PNPase impairs <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> whereas it does not affect the catalytic activities of the enzyme. Although the mutation maps outside of the KH and S 1 RNA-binding domains, analysis of the mutant protein revealed a defective RNA binding, thus suggesting that other determinants may be involved in PNPaseâRNA interactions. The mutation also caused a looser association with the degradosome and an abnormal electrophoretic mobility in native gels. The latter feature suggests an altered structural conformation of PNPase, which may account for the properties of the mutant protein...|$|E
40|$|Lrp (leucine-responsive {{regulatory}} protein) {{is a major}} Escherichia coli {{regulatory protein}} which regulates expression {{of a number of}} operons, some negatively and some positively. This work relates to a characterization of lrp, the gene encoding Lrp. Nucleotide sequencing established that the coding regions of lrp and trxB (encoding thioredoxin reductase) are separated by 543 bp and that the two genes are transcribed in opposite directions. In addition, we used primer extension, deletion analyses, and lrp-lacZ transcriptional fusions to delineate the promoter and regulatory region of the lrp operon. The lrp promoter is located 267 nucleotides upstream of the translational start codon of the lrp gene. In comparison with a wild-type strain, expression of the lrp operon was increased about 3 -fold in a strain lacking Lrp and decreased about 10 -fold in a strain overproducing Lrp. As observed from DNA mobility shift and DNase I footprinting analyses, Lrp binds to one or more sites within the region - 80 to - 32 relative to the start point of lrp transcription. A mutational analysis indicated that this same region is at least partly required for repression of lrp expression in vivo. These results demonstrate that <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of lrp involves Lrp acting directly to cause repression of lrp transcription...|$|E

Results of an RNA run-on assay indicated that inhibition of protein synthesis does not alter tubulin gene transcription. Analysis of the decay of tubulin mRNA in embryos in which RNA synthesis was inhibited by actinomycin D indicated that inhibition of protein synthesis prevents the destabilization of tubulin mRNA. The effect was similar whether mRNA was maintained on polysomes {{in the presence of}} emetine or anisomycin or displaced from the polysomes in the presence of puromycin or pactamycin; thus, the stabilization of tubulin mRNA is not dependent {{on the state of the}} polysomes after inhibition of protein synthesis. Even after tubulin mRNA declined to a low level after depolymerization of microtubules, it could be rescued by treatment of embryos with inhibitors of protein synthesis. Tubulin mRNA could be induced to accumulate prematurely in gastrulae but not in plutei if protein synthesis was inhibited, an observation that is indicative of the importance of the <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of tubulin mRNA stability during embryogenesis. Possible explanations for the role of protein synthesis in the control of mRNA stability are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The RegB endoribonuclease encoded by {{bacteriophage}} T 4 is {{a unique}} sequence-specific nuclease that cleaves {{in the middle of}} GGAG or, in a few cases, GGAU tetranucleotides, preferentially those found in the ShineâDalgarno regions of early phage mRNAs. In this study, we examined the primary structures and functional properties of RegB ribonucleases encoded by T 4 -related bacteriophages. We show that all but one of 36 phages tested harbor the regB gene homologues and the similar signals for transcriptional and post-transcriptional <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of regB expression. Phage RB 49 in addition to gpRegB utilizes Escherichia coli endoribonuclease E for the degradation of its transcripts for gene regB. The deduced primary structure of RegB proteins of 32 phages studied is almost identical to that of T 4, while the sequences of RegB encoded by phages RB 69, TuIa and RB 49 show substantial divergence from their T 4 counterpart. Functional studies using plasmidâphage systems indicate that RegB nucleases of phages T 4, RB 69, TuIa and RB 49 exhibit different activity towards GGAG and GGAU motifs in the specific locations. We expect that the availability of the different phylogenetic variants of RegB may help to localize the amino acid determinants that contribute to the specificity and cleavage efficiency of this processing enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Background: TATA Binding Protein (TBP) is {{required}} for transcription initiation by all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases. It participates in transcriptional initiation at the majority of eukaryotic gene promoters, either by direct association to the TATA box upstream of the transcription start site or by indirectly localizing to the promoter through other proteins. TBP exists in solution in a dimeric form but binds to DNA as a monomer. Here, we present the first mathematical model for auto-catalytic TBP expression {{and use it to}} study the role of dimerization in maintaining the steady state TBP level. Results: We show that the <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of TBP results in a system that is capable of exhibiting three steady states: an unstable low TBP state, one stable state corresponding to a physiological TBP concentration, and another stable steady state corresponding to unviable cells where no TBP is expressed. Our model predicts that a basal level of TBP {{is required}} to establish the transcription of the TBP gene, and hence for cell viability. It also predicts that, for the condition corresponding to a typical mammalian cell, the high-TBP state and cell viability is sensitive to variation in DNA binding strength. We use the model to explore the effect of the dimer in buffering the response to changes in TBP levels, and show that for some physiological conditions the dimer is not important in buffering against perturbations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> is {{a general}} {{strategy}} of balancing ribosomal protein synthesis in bacteria. Control mechanisms have been studied in detail for most of ribosomal protein operons, except for rpsB-tsf encoding essential r-protein S 2 and elongation factor Ts, where even the promoter has remained unknown. By using single-copy translational fusions with the chromosomal lacZ gene and Western-blot analysis, we demonstrate here that S 2 serves as a negative regulator of both rpsB and tsf expression in vivo, acting at a single target within the rpsB 5 â²-untranslated region (5 â²-UTR). As determined by primer extension, transcription of the Escherichia coli rpsB-tsf operon starts 162 nucleotides upstream of the rpsB initiation codon at a single promoter TGTGGTATAAA belonging to the extended â 10 promoter class. Both the promoter signature and the 5 â²-UTR structure of the rpsB gene appear to be highly conserved in Î³-proteobacteria. Deletion analysis of the rpsB 5 â²-UTR within rpsBâ²-â²lacZ fusions has revealed that an operator region involved in the S 2 autoregulation comprises conserved structural elements located upstream of the rpsB ribosome binding site. The S 2 -mediated autogenous control is impaired in rpsB mutants and, more surprisingly, in the rpsA mutant producing decreased amounts of truncated r-protein S 1 (rpsAâ·IS 10), indicating that S 2 might act as a repressor in cooperation with S 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{products}} of the HIR 1 and HIR 2 genes have been defined genetically as repressors of histone gene transcription in S. cerevisiae. A mutation in either gene affects cell cycle regulation {{of three of the}} four histone gene loci; transcription of these loci occurs throughout the cell cycle and is no longer repressed in response to the inhibition of DNA replication. The same mutations also eliminate <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of the HTA 1 -HTB 1 locus by histones H 2 A and H 2 B. The HIR 1 and HIR 2 genes have been isolated, and their roles in the transcriptional regulation of the HTA 1 -HTB 1 locus have been characterized. Neither gene encodes an essential protein, and null alleles derepress HTA 1 -HTB 1 transcription. Both HIR genes are expressed constitutively under conditions that lead to repression or derepression of the HTA 1 gene, and neither gene regulates the expression of the other. The sequence of the HIR 1 gene predicts an 88 -kDa protein with three repeats of a motif found in the G beta subunit of retinal transducin and in a yeast transcriptional repressor, Tup 1. The sequence of the HIR 2 gene predicts a protein of 98 kDa. Both gene products contain nuclear targeting signals, and the Hir 2 protein is localized in the nucleus...|$|E
40|$|The first enzyme for {{histidine}} biosynthesis, {{encoded in}} the hisG gene, {{is involved in}} regulation of expression of the histidine operon in Salmonella typhimurium. The studies reported here concern {{the question of how}} expression of the histidine operon is affected by a mutation in the hisG gene that alters the allosteric site of the first enzyme for histidine biosynthesis, rendering the enzyme completely resistant to inhibition by histidine. The intracellular concentrations of the enzymes encoded in the histidine operon in a strain carrying such a mutation on an episome and missing the chromosomal hisG gene are three- to fourfold higher than in a strain carrying a wild-type hisG gene on the episome. The histidine operon on such a strain fails to derepress in response to histidine limitation and fails to repress in response to excess histidine. Furthermore, utilizing other merodiploid strains, we demonstrate that the wild-type hisG gene is trans dominant to the mutant allele with respect to this regulatory phenomenon. Examination of the regulation of the histidine operon in strains carrying the feedback-resistant mutation in an episome and hisT and hisW mutations in the chromosome showed that the hisG regulatory mutation is epistatic to the hisT and hisW mutations. These data provide additional evidence that the first enzyme for histidine biosynthesis is involved in <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> of expression of the histidine operon...|$|E
40|$|A {{cluster of}} six genes, tRNATrp-secE-nusG-rplK-rplA-pkwR, was cloned and sequenced from a Corynebacterium glutamicum cosmid library and {{shown to be}} {{contiguous}} in the C. glutamicum genome. These genes encode a tryptophanyl tRNA, the protein translocase component SecE, the antiterminator protein NusG, and the ribosomal proteins L 11 and L 1 in addition to PkwR, a putative regulatory protein of the LacI-GalR family. S 1 nuclease mapping analysis revealed that nusG and rplK are expressed as separate transcriptional units and rplK and rplA are cotranscribed as a single mRNA. A 19 -nucleotide inverted repeat that appears to correspond to a transcriptional terminator was located in the 3 â² region downstream from nusG. Northern analysis with different probes confirmed the S 1 mapping results and showed that the secE-rplA four-gene region gives rise to four transcripts. secE was transcribed as a 0. 5 -kb monocistronic mRNA, nusG formed two transcripts of 1. 4 and 1. 0 kb from different initiation sites, and the two ribosomal protein genes rplK and rplA were cotranscribed as a single mRNA of 1. 6 kb. A consensus L 1 protein binding sequence was identified in the leader region of the rplK-rplA transcript, suggesting that expression of the rplK-rplA cluster was regulated by <b>autogenous</b> <b>regulation</b> exerted by the L 1 protein at the translation level. The promoters of the nusG and rplK-rplA genes were subcloned in a novel corynebacterial promoter-probe vector and shown to confer strong expression of the reporter gene...|$|E
