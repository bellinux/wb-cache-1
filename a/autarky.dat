5|$|Despite the pursued aim of pan-Germanic unification, {{the primary}} goal of the German Reich’s {{territorial}} expansionism was to acquire sufficient Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe for the Germanic übermenschen or superior men. The primary objective of this aim was to transform Germany into a complete economic <b>autarky,</b> the end-result of which would be a state of continent-wide German hegemony over Europe. This was to be accomplished through the enlargement of the territorial base of the German state and the expansion of the German population, and the wholesale extermination of the indigenous Slavic inhabitants and the Germanisation of Baltic inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th century, West European mariners—beginning with Portugal—started making still longer voyages of exploration, using {{improvements}} on translated Islamic star {{charts and}} {{a variation on}} African fishing boats called the caravel. In 1473, Lopes Gonçalves crossed the equator and disproved the Aristotelian notion that a ring of fire would bar exploration of the southern hemisphere. Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1487; in 1498, Vasco da Gama reached Malindi, where a local pilot showed him how to follow the monsoon to India. In 1492, relying on incorrect estimates of the circumference of the Earth, the Genovese Christopher Columbus sailed from Cadiz to the Canaries and thence into the open Atlantic in a Spanish attempt to reach the Orient. Instead, he made landfall on {{an island in the}} Caribbean Sea. The resulting Columbian Exchange introduced potatoes, corn, and chili peppers to the Old World while smallpox epidemics devastated the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This disruption and depopulation permitted rapid Spanish conquests and led to the widespread adoption of African slavery to man lucrative tobacco, sugar, indigo, and cotton plantations. In 1519, Juan Sebastián Elcano completed Magellan's Spanish expedition to sail around the world. These and other voyages permitted European maps to attain a previously impossible degree of accuracy. In 1538, Gerardus Mercator devised a map projection conveniently making constant bearings (rhumb lines) straight. In the Arctic, in 1594, the Dutch captain Willem Barentsz reached Svalbard and the Barents Sea while, in the south, Anthony de la Roché crossed the Antarctic Convergence in 1675 and three separate expeditions—one British, one American, and one Russian—all claimed to have discovered Antarctica in 1820. Not all voyages of discovery originated in Western Europe. Although accurate charting of the coasts of Russia only began in the 18th century and the archipelago of Severnaya Zemlya was not discovered until 1910, Novgorodians had been sailing the White Sea since at least the 13th century. Despite a long-standing preference for <b>autarky,</b> China briefly opened up under the Song and Mongol Yuan dynasties. In the early 15th century, Zheng He's fleet of treasure ships repeatedly sailed from Ming China with 37,000 men aboard 317 ships, reaching as far as the African coast. Chinese exploration, however, was soon curtailed again and finally outlawed. The peoples of East Asia were introduced to the true shape of the other continents from the maps of Matteo Ricci.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{identify}} {{a new relationship}} between classical and nonmonotonic logic; specifically, we relate <b>autarkies</b> for CNF formulas [Monien and Speckenmeier] to unfounded sets for logic normal logic programs [Van Gelder, Ross, Schlipf]. Using a natural way to construct a logic program PC from a CNF formula C, we show that that the all-negative <b>autarkies</b> for C are exactly the unfounded sets of PC. In CNF satisfiability there is no preference for setting variables true or false. Thus polarities of some variables may be flipped in a CNF formula C, giving different logic programs PC and thus different unfounded sets. Seeking <b>autarkies</b> has been pursued in CNF satisfiability engines; we were inspired by Sean Weaver’s adding of “safe ” constraints: new constraints known not to destroy consistency. By using unfounded sets as above, we have a different, and generally more aggressive, way of seeking <b>autarkies.</b> Our hope is that this approach can also give {{a way to use}} failed stochastic local searches for satisfying truth assignments to find <b>autarkies...</b>|$|R

The Nazi government tried to limit the number of its trade partners, and, when possible, only trade with countries within the German sphere of influence. A number of bilateral trade agreements were signed between Germany and other European countries (mostly countries located in Southern and South-Eastern Europe) during the 1930s. The German government strongly encouraged trade with these countries but strongly discouraged trade with any others.|$|E

Primary 68 Q 15, 03 B 05, 68 T 15; Secondary 90 C 09. 1 Introduction The reader is supposed to be familiar with the basic terminology and facts regarding the Satisfiability Problem (see [7] for a survey). Some well known tractable classes of Satisfiability Problems are known as Horn [5], renamable Horn [9], extended Horn [3], balanced [4, 12], SLUR (Single Lookahead Unit Resolution) [10], the latter class including the preceding ones, and q-Horn [2, 1, 11]. The class of q-Horn formulas includes (renamable) Horn and 2 -SAT. Franco [6] has shown that SLUR and q-Horn are incomparable extensions of Horn. In this note we prove that another tractable class of formulas which was introduced by Kullmann [8], the class of formulas solvable [...] ...|$|R

Traditional interpretations of the capital peace contend that development and global markets will eventually eliminate resource competition as a motive for war. This view was eventually deemed outdated, as “it became clear that needed raw materials would continue {{to make their way}} to industrial centers through free markets, rather than through mercantilist <b>autarkies</b> (Gartzke & Hewitt, 2010, p. 122).|$|R
40|$|Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) {{is arguably}} the archetypical NP-complete {{decision}} problem. Progress in SAT solving algorithms has motivated an ever increasing number of practical applications in recent years. However, many practical uses of SAT involve solving function as opposed to decision problems. Concrete examples include computing minimal unsatisfiable subsets, minimal correction subsets, prime implicates and implicants, minimal models, backbone literals, and <b>autarkies,</b> among several others. In most cases, solving a function problem requires a number of adaptive or non-adaptive calls to a SAT solver. Given the computational complexity of SAT, it is therefore important to develop algorithms that either require the smallest possible number of calls to the SAT solver, or that involve simpler instances. This paper addresses a number of representative function problems defined on Boolean formulas, and shows that all these function problems {{can be reduced to}} a generic problem of computing a minimal set subject to a monotone predicate. This problem {{is referred to as the}} Minimal Set over Monotone Predicate (MSMP) problem. This exercise provides new ways for solving well-known function problems, including prime implicates, minimal correction subsets, backbone literals, independent variables and <b>autarkies,</b> among several others. Moreover, this exercise motivates the development of more efficient algorithms for the MSMP problem. Finally the paper outlines a number of areas of future research related with extensions of the MSMP problem. Comment: This version contains some fixes in formatting and bibliograph...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{relationship}} between real exchange rate and growth {{in the process of}} economic integration. Using a 2 x 2 x 2 model of overlapping generations, we show that growth depends on the real exchange rate (RER) through human capital accu- mulation. Integration leads to convergence in growth rates only in presence of cross-border externalities in human capital. Otherwise, divergence is likely to occur and integration may be good (bad) for growth if the integrated RER is higher (lower) than the <b>autarky's</b> RER. In reality, since capital mobility prevents the real exchange rate from adjusting, economic inte- gration may lead to income divergence if countries are too different in terms of preference, altruism or productivity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} two incomplete {{polynomial time}} algorithms to solve satisfiability problems which both use Linear Programming (LP) techniques. First, the FlipFlop LP attempts to simulate a Quadratic Program which would solve the CNF at hand. Second, the Weighted-LinearAutarky LP is an extended {{variant of the}} LinearAutarky LP as defined by Kullmann [6] and iteratively updates its weights to find <b>autarkies</b> in a given formula. Besides solving satisfiability problems, this LP {{could also be used}} to study the existence of autark assignments in formulas. Results within the experimental domain (up to 1000 variables) show a considerably sharper lower bound for the uniform random 3 -Sat phase transition density than the proved lower bound of the myopic algorithm (> 3. 26) by Achlioptas [1] and even than that of the greedy algorithm (> 3. 52) proposed by Kaporis [5]. ...|$|R

25|$|Government {{control of}} {{business}} {{was part of}} Mussolini's policy planning. By 1935, he claimed that three-quarters of Italian businesses were under state control. Later that year, Mussolini issued several edicts to further control the economy, e.g. forcing banks, businesses, and private citizens to surrender all foreign-issued stock and bond holdings to the Bank of Italy. In 1936, he imposed price controls. He also attempted to turn Italy into a self-sufficient <b>autarky,</b> instituting high barriers on trade with most countries except Germany.|$|E

40|$|Nationalism is {{important}} in shaping the politics of every country throughout the world, but the economic rationale underlying nationalism remains unclear. This paper provides a framework for analyzing nationalistic sentiments, including asserted supremacy of national interests, xenophobia, state sovereignty, and militarization. The level of nationalistic sentiments varies by {{the relative importance of}} the domestic market to local economies. <b>Autarkies</b> display the most nationalism, and nationalistic sentiments are weaker (stronger) where the local economy relies more on exports (domestic sales). Our paper next tests this theory using a unique dataset collected across 218 Chinese cities. Using within-country variations in nationalistic sentiments, we are able to identify their association with trade in a context with the same set of history, ethnicity, ideology, and geopolitics. We find a negative association between nationalistic sentiments and dependence on exports, {{with a wide range of}} city characteristics such as demographics, protectionist attitudes, and business climate held constant. In contrast, we find no equivalent association between other ideologies and dependence on exports. ...|$|R

Despite <b>autarky's</b> connection to geographical concepts such as space, resources and population, its historical impact has been relatively little explored in the literature. In this article, we first present how the concept of ‘autarky’ conflates two etymological meanings: self-sufficiency and authoritarianism. We then explore this duality, using archival sources, by examining {{the social and economic}} policies applied to the fishing sector in Francoist Spain between 1939 and 1951. On the one hand, we examine the repression and transformation of the fishers' social world. On the other, we study the impact of public policies on the marine fishing fleet, underlining the importance of the militaristic guidelines that shaped the reforms. We argue that these autarkic reforms have had long-term consequences that are still visible today. They represented a rupture for the associative environment of fishers and shaped the future characteristics of the fleet, as well as its pattern of geographical expansion...|$|R

25|$|Absent the use {{of trade}} to access resources, {{economic}} transactions were essentially intra-lineage obligations of labor.

As the Andes are a relatively young mountain range, there is an especially great variation in waterfall and temperature, which has great importance for agriculture. This is all the more important as only about 2% of the land in the Andes is arable.|$|E

40|$|Goal-sensitive {{resolution}} methods, such as Model Elimination, {{have been}} observed {{to have a higher}} degree of search redundancy than model-search methods, Therefore, resolution methods have not been seen in high performance propositional satis ability testers. A method to reduce search redundancy in goal-sensitive resolution methods is introduced. The idea {{at the heart of the}} method is to attempt to construct a refutation and a model simultaneously and incrementally, based on sub-search outcomes. The method exploits the concept of &quot;, which can be informally described as a -su cient &quot; model for some clauses, but which does not a ect the remaining clauses of the formula. Incorporating this method into Model Elimination leads to an algorithm called Modoc. Modoc is shown, both analytically and experimentally, to be faster than Model Elimination by an exponential factor. Modoc, unlike Model Elimination, is able to nd a model if it fails to nd a refutation, essentially by combining <b>autarkies.</b> Unlike the pruning strategies of most re nements of resolution, autarky-related pruning does not prune any successful refutation; it only prunes attempts that ultimately will be unsuccessful; consequently, it will not force the underlying Modoc search to nd an unnecessarily long refutation.

40|$|International audienceClinical {{research}} {{may be seen}} {{in the context of the}} more general problem of an exchange of knowledge between psychopathology and neurosciences. While this interaction is not contested by the specialists in either field, we cannot, nonetheless, ignore the question of their various levels of congruence. More generally, we are increasingly aware of a need for enhanced formalization of the models derived from the two disciplines with a view to setting up transpositions or even cross fertilizations. The two communities, that of psychiatrists and that of neurobiologists, while they fascinate each other, have rarely been able to produce joint findings. The psychopathologist expects a positive validation of his clinical concepts from the neurobiologist, while the neurobiologist, who has frequently not resisted the etiological temptation, wants the clinician to give him pointers to enable him to refine his own experimental models. What is required, however, is that both the psychopathologist and the neurobiologist reduce their expectations and agree to move outside of their respective disciplinary <b>autarkies.</b> This would avoid two traps: that of the homological temptation which leads both to graft an experimental model onto clinical entities without checking the levels of congruence or non-congruence, making do with a simple behavioral similarity; the second error consists in using the complexity of the clinical picture as an unavoidable obstacle to any coming-together of the two disciplines. These two traps have not always been avoided, in particular in the context of the use of cognitive paradigms in nosographic clinical models...|$|R
40|$|The {{regional}} {{employment growth}} in Germany {{is characterized by}} huge disparities. Whereas institutional factors might explain the disparities of employment growth between nations, they can only account for a minor fraction of the regional employment growth. Instead the sectoral structure of employment is often seen as {{a major reason for}} regional disparities. An important attribute of the research conducted so far is that it concentrates on estimating shift-share-regression-models when controlling for the influence of the sectoral structure on employment growth. However, these models do not account for spatial interdependencies and treat regions as <b>autarkies,</b> though on a regional level such effects are very likely to occur. Against this background, the present article focuses on analyzing the role played by spatial interdependencies between regions in explaining their employment growth. By using spatial econometric methods this article emphasizes that regional employment growth is characterized by spatial autocorrelation, pointing to spatial interdependencies between the regions. This holds true also for mayor factors of regional employment such as wages and qualification. In this article three different models of spatial interdependencies are being compared: the spatial lag, spatial error and cross regressive model. While the spatial lag model controls for the influence {{of the value of the}} endogenous variable in neighboring regions (i. e. the spatial lag of the endogenous variable) on the endogenous variable in the observed region, the spatial error model estimates the influence of the spatial lag of the error term. Finally, the cross regressive model includes the spatial lag of the exogenous variables. These spatial interdependencies are integrated into the framework of the shift-share-regression-model to identify the relevant spatial interdependencies and to measure their influence on the regional employment growth in Germany. Preliminary results indicate that the spatial autocorrelation of the regional employment growth is to a large extend caused by the spatial lags of the exogenous variables. The spatial lag of the endogenous variable and the error term become insignificant, when the spatial lags of the exogenous variables are being accounted for. These effects can be interpreted as spatial spillover effects...|$|R

The document guaranteed Albanians freedom of speech, the press, organization, association, and assembly but subordinated these rights to the individual's duties to society as a whole. The constitution continued to emphasize national pride and unity, and enshrined in law the idea of <b>autarky</b> and prohibited the government from seeking financial aid or credits or from forming joint companies with partners from capitalist or revisionist communist countries.
