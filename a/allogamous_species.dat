Germination was little affected by inbreeding but mortality and the number of capitula showed inbreeding depression, especially in the presence of competition.

A Brassica napus crop called nabicol is grown in northwestern Spain. Knowledge on its mating system is needed in order to manage the germplasm correctly and design breeding strategies. The aims of this work were to study the mating system of nabicol under field conditions and the relationship of different traits with the mat-ing system. We analyzed 2 populations with microsatellites using a multilocus approach, finding that both had a mixed mating system with an outcrossing rate of 30 %. This system would allow application of breeding methods for both autogamous and <b>allogamous</b> <b>species</b> in order to improve nabicol populations. Nabicol populations should be multiplied in isolation conditions in the same way as <b>allogamous</b> <b>species</b> in order to avoid contamination and preserve genetic integrity. The relationship of out-crossing rate, phenological, ecological, and morphological traits was studied, but the model explained only a small percentage of the variability. None of the traits studied could be used as indirect selection criteria for a type of mating system under the conditions of northwestern Spain. This is the first work that studies in depth the possible causes of the mixed mating system of B. napus, finding that, surprisingly, it is not related to the most obvious factors.

Indeed, from 3 to 9 phenotypes per locus were investigated in this study. The percentage of polymorphic loci (P = 59. 3 %) was higher than that mentioned in the autogamous species (P = 20. 3 %) and less than the optimum (P= 96 %) indicated for allogamous plants. Total genetic diversity (H T) and within population genetic diversity (H S) were estimated with the isozyme markers. The contribution of among population genetic diversity (D ST) to total genetic diversity was 22 %. Enzyme markers pointed out an average inbreeding level for whole population (F IT) and within population (F IS). Within population genetic diversity represents 78 % of total diversity. Intra-population genetic diversity (H S = 0. 206) was ranged with the respect of <b>allogamous</b> <b>species</b> and was clearly higher than that of among population genetic diversity (D ST = 0. 057) indicating an out-crossing predominance in the studied populations.

Our recent nuclear rDNA sequence survey indicated that Cyclotella meneghiniana, {{one of the most}} intensivelystudied freshwater diatoms, is another example of a species complex. We therefore sampled genetic variation in the D 1 /D 2 regions of the nuclear 28 S rDNA and in a segment of the plastid encoded psaA gene in a larger sample of C. meneghiniana 15 strains to assess genetic diversity and genetic structure over a wider geographic range within this diatom. A strict congruenceof nuclear rDNA and psaA variants was observed, indicative of the presence of eight genetically distinct, cryptic lineages, fourof which were not represented in our previous study. To test whether the genetic structure is caused by the complete lack ofallogamy, or by the presence of reproductive barriers between <b>allogamous</b> cryptic <b>species,</b> we generated AFLP fingerprintsfrom two subsamples of sympatric strains.

Apomixis as a whole has not been detected in the genus Medicago, but components of apomixis have been reported. The formation of unreduced eggs through diplosporic meiosis was documented in a diploid mutant of M. saliva ssp. falcata (L.) Arcang., named PG-F 9. Since in facultative apomictic species non-reductional meiosis and parthenogenesis could be tightly associated processes, a progeny test based on morphological trait and molecular marker evaluation was carried out to verify the occurrence of parthenogenesis in PG-F 9. Morphological traits such as leaf shape, stipule form, stem pigmentation and flower colour were shown to be effective in the preliminary screening of progenies and most of the plants were classified as non-maternal (i. e. from sexual reproduction). Molecular investigations by means of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprint and heterozygous restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) loci detection conducted on the progenies classified morphologically as maternal allowed two plants, molecularly similar but not identical to PG-F 9, to be discovered. Owing to the high number of molecular markers conserved as in the mother plant, and because of the great discriminating efficiency of the primers and probes used, these progeny plants could most likely be generated through parthenogenesis of diplosporic eggs. In fact, the extraordinary preservation of maternal morphological traits and genomic loci over one generation may be explained only if apomictic reproductive events rarely took place in PG-F 9...|$|R

C. canephora, an <b>allogamous</b> diploid <b>species,</b> {{and one of the}} parents of the allotetraploid C. arabica, has been an important source of genetic variability for breeding programs of both cultivated species. Highly heterozygous genomes such as C. canephora require a much higher sequence depth to reach acceptable marker call rates and genotype accuracy, when using sequence-based genotyping methods such that their cost effectiveness may not be realized. Here we describe the development and validation of a 26 K Axiom SNP array (Affymetrix) whose genome- wide distributed SNP content was discovered from pooled whole-genome resequencing of C. canephora accessions covering most of its known genetic diversity. Besides facilitating low cost, high marker density, polymorphism and speed of data generation, the platform displays high genotype call accuracy and reproducibility. Genotyping validation resulted in 24, 073 SNPs (94. 6 %) successfully converted out of the 25, 456 SNPs on the array. 20, 982 markers(87. 1 %) were scored as providing high-resolution genotypic data in a set of 800 individuals of a breeding population in which 19, 586 (81. 4 %) were polymorphic and 1, 396 (5. 8 %) were monomorphic.

Individuals were sampled in each of the two populations and ISSR (inter-simple sequence repeat) molecular markers were applied to document the distribution of the genetic diversity within and among the populations. Essential oils were extracted by steam distillation from individuals collected in the two populations and analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results suggest that genetic diversity levels of L. origanoides in Magdalena and Chicamocha are relatively high (Hs ranged from 0. 35 to 0. 37) and comparable to <b>allogamous</b> plant <b>species</b> and other related species of the same genus. A rather low genetic differentiation (qII varied from 0. 07 to 0. 17) was found between the two populations, in spite of the relatively large geographical distance between them. The essential oils of L. origanoides can be classified as monoterpenic in type, and according to the relative amount of the major compounds, six chemotypes are proposed. Five of them (B, C, D, F and G) are present in the canyon of the Chicamocha river, while two of them (C and E) are present in Magdalena. Chemotypes B and C are similar to chemotypes previously reported. In summary, the essential oils from individuals collected in Chicamocha are rich in thymol (chemotypes C and D); carvacrol (chemotype B); Ρcymene, eucalyptol (+ Β-phellandrene trace) and thymol methyl ether (chemotype F); and thymol methyl ether, pcymene, thymol and Υ-terpinene (chemotype G); while those from Magdalena are rich in thymol (chemotype C), and eucalyptol and α-phellandrene (chemotype E).

However, the genomics of alfalfa, a non-model species, {{is still in its}} infancy. The recent advent of RNA-Seq, a massively parallel sequencing method for transcriptome analysis, provides an opportunity to expand the identification of alfalfa genes and polymorphisms, and conduct in-depth transcript profiling. Results Cell walls in stems of alfalfa genotype 708 have higher cellulose and lower lignin concentrations compared to cell walls in stems of genotype 773. Using the Illumina GA-II platform, a total of 198, 861, 304 expression sequence tags (ESTs, 76 bp in length) were generated from cDNA libraries derived from elongating stem (ES) and post-elongation stem (PES) internodes of 708 and 773. In addition, 341, 984 ESTs were generated from ES and PES internodes of genotype 773 using the GS FLX Titanium platform. The first alfalfa (Medicago sativa) gene index (MSGI 1. 0) was assembled using the Sanger ESTs available from GenBank, the GS FLX Titanium EST sequences, and the de novo assembled Illumina sequences. MSGI 1. 0 contains 124, 025 unique sequences including 22, 729 tentative consensus sequences (TCs), 22, 315 singletons and 78, 981 pseudo-singletons. We identified a total of 1, 294 simple sequence repeats (SSR) among the sequences in MSGI 1. 0. In addition, a total of 10, 826 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were predicted between the two genotypes. Out of 55 SNPs randomly selected for experimental validation, 47 (85 %) were polymorphic between the two genotypes. We also identified numerous allelic variations within each genotype. Digital gene expression analysis identified numerous candidate genes that {{may play a role in}} stem development as well as candidate genes that may contribute to the differences in cell wall composition in stems of the two genotypes.

Three new reference genomes were reconstructed to support our comparative genome analyses. Comparative sequence alignment reveals group-, species-, and accession-specific polymorphisms, which explains characteristic fruit traits and growth habits in the different cultivars. Using gene models from the annotated Heinz 1706 reference genome, we observed differences dN/dS ratio in fruit and growth diversification genes compared to a random set of genes, pointing to positive selection and to differences in selection pressure between crop accessions and wild species. In wild species SNPs are found in excess of 10 million, i. e. 20 fold higher than found in most of the crop accessions, indicating dramatic genetic erosion of crop and heirloom tomatoes. In addition, highest levels of heterozygosity were found for <b>allogamous</b> SI wild <b>species,</b> while facultative and autogamous SC species display a lower heterozygosity level. Using whole genome SNP information for Maximum Likelihood analysis we achieved complete tree resolution, whereas ML trees based on SNPs from 10 fruit and growth genes show incomplete resolution for the crop accessions, partly due to the effect of heterozygous SNPs. Finally, results suggest that phylogenetic relationships are correlated with habitat pointing at the occurrence of geographical races within these groups, which is of practical importance for Solanum genome evolution studies...|$|R

This species, originating from Southern Europe and South-Western Asia, is widespread in the Mediterranean region and has been reported as carrying genes for enhancing agronomic and grain quality traits.

Chinese Spring (CS) nuclear genome by interspecific hybridization with a D. villosum population collected in Latium. The disomic addition line CS+ 6 V carrying chromosome 6 V# 1 and bred by the late E. R. Sears, was also included in the study. The two aneuploid lines resulted completely resistant to Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) at adult and seedling plant stage. The CS V 63 line was crossed to the susceptible disomic addition line 6 V # 1 and a suitable mapping population, segregating for powdery mildew resistance, was produced. The F 2 : 3 progenies were studied both by phytopathological (with selected pathotypes of Bgt) and molecular (PCR marker) analyses in order to assess the genetic basis of resistance. The observed resistant: susceptible phenotypic ratio fitted the 3 : 1 ratio expected for the segregation of the resistance/susceptible alleles at one locus named “PmVt”, presumably located in 6 VS. The resistant phenotype was dominant. Molecular analyses using the RAPD marker OPH 171900 were carried out to confirm the location of this gene on 6 VS and to verify its relationship with the Pm 21 locus and association to the gliadin-encoding locus Gli-V 2.

These results suggest that all species require pollinator visits for reproduction, despite their different reproductive systems.

In this study, the capability of AFLP(R) (1) markers to provide a reliable and meaningful estimate of genetic conformity of different varieties was investigated in diploid perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne spp.), an <b>allogamous</b> <b>species</b> whose varieties are genetically heterogeneous. Twelve accessions with known breeding lineage, comprising five closely related groups, were included in the study. For the set of test accessions analysed, the AFLP protocol accurately reproduced the same relationships as were evident from examining their morphology and both these results were consistent with the relationships known to exist within the different test groups. Principal components analysis as well as cluster analysis associated unambiguously the IV and the EDV accessions. It was concluded that the methodology developed in this study {{could be used as a}} model from which to create a protocol for evaluating putative cases of essential derivation...|$|E
40|$|Cultivated alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is an <b>allogamous</b> {{autotetraploid}} <b>species</b> with 2 n = 4 x = 32 chromosomes. Alfalfa is {{the most}} cultivated forage legume in the world mainly due to its wide adaptation to diverse environmental conditions and efficient nitrogen fixation ability. Kyrgyzstan is among the major alfalfa producing countries. The analysis of alfalfa genetic diversity helps to assess the future risk of genetic erosion and helps {{in the development of}} sustainable conservation strategies and wise use of the genetic variation in breeding programs. The aim of this Master thesis was to study the genetic diversity of alfalfa grown in Kyrgyzstan and in other countries and determine the genetic relationship using simple sequence repeat (SSR, microsatellite) molecular markers as well as to {{contribute to the development of}} synthetic alfalfa varieties for use as forage in Kyrgyzstan. A total of 78 cultivated alfalfa genotypes from 60 accessions representing 24 countries were used for the SSR analysis. Medicago lupulina and M. scutellata were represented by one sample each as outgroups. Ten SSR loci were analyzed in this study, nine of which were polymorphic. The locus AGGT- 004 was monomorphic across the 78 cultivated alfalfa individuals analyzed. A total of 53 alleles were recorded across the ten loci of cultivated alfalfa accessions, with an average of 5. 3 alleles per locus. The number of alleles (Na) for the nine polymorphic loci varied from two (locus ACT- 026) to nine (locus AGAT- 012). Of the ten SSR loci used, seven are highly recommended for alfalfa genetic diversity analysis, as high genetic variation was detected at these loci. The locus AGAT- 012 is highly interesting in that it had several alleles at low frequencies which might be linked to desirable traits. At this locus, 98. 6 % of the individuals investigated were heterozygotes. Analysis of variance (AMOVA) revealed that 95 % of the total genetic variation was found within countries and the remaining 5 % differentiated the accessions according to their countries of origin (FST = 0. 13; P = 0. 005). AMOVA revealed no significant differentiation between accessions from the Western and Eastern countries (P = 0. 14). The Jaccard similarity coefficient and cluster analysis revealed a significant genetic variation between Kyrgyz alfalfa genotypes, which is significant enough for alfalfa improvement, including the development of synthetic varieties. The use of Kyrgyz accessions, such as BM- 5 and BM- 9 / 4 for the development of synthetic varieties through crossing with genotypes from other Kyrgyz accessions is recommended, as the genotypes from these accessions were the most differentiated as compared to other genotypes originated from other Kyrgyz alfalfa accessions. The introduction of new alfalfa genetic material from countries such as Argentina, Oman, Australia, Iran, Iraq and Norway into Kyrgyzstan is a great opportunity to increase genetic variation in the alfalfa gene pool in the country...|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands the {{distinction}} of the species Spergularia media (L.) C. Presl (Syn. : S. marginata (DC.) Kittel) and Spergularia marina (L.) Grisebach (Syn. : S. salina J. et C. Presl) is not always easy. These taxonomical difficulties gave cause to investigate the variability of these two halophilous species. From a nomenclatorical study it appeared that S. media and S. marina are the legitimate names (Chapter I). The variability of both Spergularia-species has been studied by means of population samples (Chapter II). The seeds of S. media and S. marina vary from unwinged to broadly winged; however, the variation per plant is limited, the plants mostly producing in their proximal capsules either unwinged to rudimentary or narrowly winged, or only broadly winged seeds. These differences in {{the width of the}} seed wing are apparently genetically controlled. In general the winged seeds are larger than the unwinged seeds. The most important diagnostic characters of both Spergularia-species are (a) the number of stamens: in S. media (0 -) 10, in S. marina (0 -) 2 - 5 (- 10) and (b) the diameter of the flower: in S. media (7 -) 10 - 12 (- 13) mm, in S. marina (4 -) 5 - 7 (- 8) mm Both species show a reduction of the androecium; the total number of stamens and staminodes of S. media is always 10, but when staminodes are present the diameter of the flower is smaller; flowers 7 - 8 mm in diam. always have a considerable number of staminodes. S. marina rarely has staminodes: if present there are at most only three of them. Other diagnostic characters are the length of the bracts and the position of the stigmas. In Chapter II the variability is correlated with the geographic distribution and the environment. The distribution of S. media {{on the outside of the}} dikes can be correlated with the salinity of M(ean) H(igh) W(ater). The limit of distribution upstream in the estuaries is found near the transition of Polyhalinicum to Mesohalinicum (see page 72). S. media is a differential species of the order Glauceto-Puccinellietalia. In some respects this species shows an independent behaviour in its relation to the other species of this order. S. media occurs in a zonation of vegetation in the Artemisietum maritimae and not in the Puccinellietum maritimae and vice versa. In sandy regions S. media is found in the zonation below Puccinellia maritima. Populations of S. media with a high frequency of plants producing unwinged seeds are found in open pioneer vegetation, on sandy soil in an extreme and unstable environment (see photo 2, page 81) or in intensively grazed vegetations (also on clayey soils). Populations of S. media composed of plants that produce exclusively winged seeds, are found in closed vegetation on clayey soil in a less extreme and more stable environment (see photo 1, page 81). In the population complex of S. media there is apparently an ecotypical differentiation. Populations composed of plants producing exclusively unwinged seeds do not occur in the Netherlands, the pressure of selection probably not being strong enough. On the isle of Römö (Denmark) and according to reports in the literature also elsewhere in Europe and North-Africa there are populations exclusively composed of plants with unwinged seeds. As the genetically controlled variability of the size of the seeds and the seed wing is largest in relative extreme and unstable environments, the variability decreases when the environment becomes less extreme and more stable. This also happens when the environment becomes very extreme. When population of extreme and less extreme environments are compared, the population density is higher, and the mean age of the individuals lower, in the first case. The distribution of S. marina on the outside of the dikes can be correlated with the salinity of M(ean) H(igh) W(ater). In the Mesohalinicum (see page 72) S. marina is found on the level of M. H. W., in the Polyhalinicum and Buhalinicum S. marina occurs at a higher level with regard to M. H. W. Upstream in the estuaries the limit of distribution is found mostly near the transition between Mesohalinicum and Oligohalinicum. S. marina is a differential species of the alliance Puccinellio-Spergularion. The species occurs in the subordinate associations with high presence. In one locality in the Netherlands, (see photo 3, page 110), namely in the eastern part of Terschelling, a population of S. marina is found that for the greater part is composed of plants producing exclusively broadly winged seeds in their proximal capsules. In general it can be concluded that incidental factors have a considerable influence on the variation pattern in the Netherlands as a result of the small size of the local populations, the scattered habitats and the obligatory autogamy. As regards dissemination, S. media and S. marina are polychorous, namely anemochorous, hydrochorous, zoochorous and anthropochorous (Chapter IV). Both Spergularia-species show a number of differences in floral structure and floral ecology (see page 124 e. v.). S. media is, dependent on the circumstances, allogamous or autogamous; S. marina is almost invariably autogamous, very rarely <b>allogamous.</b> Both <b>species</b> do not hybridise (Chapter IV). The diploid number of chromosomes of S. media is 18 and of S. marina 36 (Chapter V). In Chapter VI a taxonomic description of S. media and S. marina is given and a key of all the Spergularia-species native in the Netherlands. The final conclusions of the general discussion (Chapter VII) are that S. media and S. marina are clearly distinguishable on morphological, cytological and also ecological grounds. The species are reproductively isolated. Both species are very variable. In the population complex of S. media a great deal of ecotypical differentiation is found. The local populations of S. media are not reproductively isolated, and the same applies to the local populations of S. marina. As the variation is clinal no infraspecific taxa are described...|$|R

40|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Costa Rican {{transgenic}} rice varieties resistant to ammonium gluphosinate (PPT), an integrated risk assessment evaluation is required, to determine the potential environmental impact of gene flow to native wild Oryza species and the weedy rice complex. Populations of the wild relatives of rice were identified, located and characterized by CIBCM throughout the country. This study demonstrated that Costa Rica is home for three of the four wild Oryza species native to tropical America: O. glumaepatula, O. latifolia and O. grandiglumis. O. glumaepatula is the species more closely related to cultivated rice, O. sativa, sharing AA-type genome, while the others are allotetraploid, with CCDD genomes. The genetic relationship of O. glumaepatula and the cultivated rice raises concerns about gene flow from cultivated rice to these natural populations, particularly, in the Medio Queso wetlands located in the north part of Costa Rica, where the two species grow in near proximity. In order to fill the gap on knowledge about the reproductive biology of O. glumaepatula, progeny studies were perfomed using molecular markers O. glumaepatula mother plants and their progenies were analyzed using fluorescent microsatellites, demonstrating that O. glumaepatula is predominantly autogamous but occasionally behaves as a facultative <b>allogamous</b> <b>species.</b> To study the compatibility between O. glumaepatula and O. sativa, artificial crosses were performed between both species.

These compounds possessing anti-diabetic and anti-cancer properties and are predominantly produced by Fagopyrum spp. In the present study, PAL gene was sequenced from three Fagopyrum spp. (F. tataricum, F. esculentum and F. dibotrys) and showed the presence of three SNPs and four insertion/deletions at intra and inter specific level. Among them, the potential SNP (position 949 th bp G>C) with Parsimony Informative Site was selected and successfully utilised to individuate the zygosity/allelic variation of 16 F. tataricum varieties. Insertion mutations were identified in coding region, which resulted the change of a stretch of 39 amino acids on the putative protein. Our Study revealed that autogamous species (F. tataricum) has lower frequency of observed SNPs as compared to <b>allogamous</b> <b>species</b> (F. dibotrys and F. esculentum). The identified SNPs in F. tataricum didn’t result to amino acid change, while in other two species it caused both conservative and non-conservative variations.

40|$|Floral nectar of animal-pollinated {{plants is}} {{commonly}} infested with microorganisms, yet {{little is known}} about the microorganisms inhabiting the floral nectar of orchids. In this study, we investigated microbial communities occurring in the floral nectar of seven Epipactis (Orchidaceae) species. Culturable bacteria and yeasts were isolated and identified by partially sequencing the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and the D 1 /D 2 domains of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene, respectively. Using three different culture media, we found that bacteria were common inhabitants of the floral nectar of Epipactis. The most widely distributed bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in nectar of Epipactis were representatives of the family of Enterobacteriaceae, with an unspecified Enterobacteriaceae bacterium as the most common. In contrast to previous studies investigating microbial communities in floral nectar, very few yeast species (mainly of the genus Cryptococcus) were observed, and most of them occurred in very low densities. Total OTU richness (i. e., the number of bacterial and yeast OTUs per orchid species) varied between 4 and 20. Cluster analysis revealed that microbial communities of <b>allogamous</b> <b>species</b> differed from those of autogamous and facultatively autogamous species.

Eight polymorphic microsatellite loci were analyzed in eight families, each represented by 10 six-month old seedlings derived from open-pollinated pods. The estimation for the multilocus outcrossing rate ($tm = 1. 0) and individual outcrossing rate ($t = 1. 0) for this population suggests that T. grandiflorum may be a perfect outbreeding (<b>allogamous)</b> <b>species.</b> Likewise, for the studied population the estimate for single locus outcrossing rate ($ts) was elevated (0. 946), but lower than $tm, confirming the likely outcrossing character of the species and suggesting the occurrence of 5. 4 % biparental inbreeding rate ($tm- $ts). The estimation of genetic divergence ($FST) between allelic frequencies in ovules and pollen revealed a deviation from random mating in 75 % of the evaluated loci. Likewise, the estimate of correlation of paternity ($rp = 0. 930) and the mean coefficient of co-ancestrality within families ($θxy = 0. 501) indicated that the outcrossings were predominantly correlated, and the offspring were full-sibs.
