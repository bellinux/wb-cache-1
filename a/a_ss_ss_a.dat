40|$|Over {{the past}} 5 years, the on-chip {{detection}} and manipulation of magnetic beads via magnetoelectronics {{has emerged as}} a promising new biosensor platform. Magnetic bead sensing (MBS) provides a highly sensitive and specific technique, enabling these sensors to meet the diagnostic needs that are currently not met by existing technologies. Although many studies have proven the high physical sensitivity of magnetic sensors, the establishment of dose-response curves using MBS is unexplored and their capability to sensitively detect low concentrations of target molecules for diagnostic applications has remained unproven. In this study, we have exploited an alternative MBS concept based on the repositioning of the magnetic beads toward the most sensitive location on the spin valve sensors to allow for highly sensitive immunosensing over a wide range of target concentrations. Furthermore, we present the optimization of the magnetoimmuno assay, i. e., the surface chemistry, the blocking procedure, and the type of magnetic particle, for the highly sensitive and specific detection of S 100 <b>ss</b> <b>ss,</b> <b>a</b> diagnostic marker for stroke and minor head injury.

40|$|The article {{shows how}} in Kierkegaard’s {{treatment}} {{of the concept of}} possibility (as well as in the treatment of freedom, thus in the not-necessity of the history) both in the "Concept of Anxiety" and in the contemporary "Philosophical Fragments" (1844), for instance, there seems to be possible to make out Schelling’s meontology; I refer to the distinction Schelling regained from Plato’s Sophist [237 <b>a</b> <b>ss.,</b> 256 d <b>ss.,</b> 258 <b>a</b> <b>ss.</b> ] between the Greek “subjective” and “objective” negation, mé on and ouk on, in order to found Good’s freedom in the creation. While the Greek negation ouk totally denies the reality of something both in thought and in actuality, the negation mé just denies the actual being of something, but not its possibility, thus defining something as “not existing”, but still possible. both Schelling and Kierkegaard emphasize the same difficulty for philosophy, that is the difficulty of a scientific discourse which pretends to include reality in a system, that is something constantly “possible” and never completed. To include something in a system means – as we saw – to transform it, through rational comprehension, in something that is necessary, it means to misrepresent it. Nevertheless, Schelling had even been able to include the not-being in its system, taking it as something existing, but in the way of possibility.
