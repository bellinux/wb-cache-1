5|$|About 75% of {{the island}} chain lost power {{for a few hours}} during the storm. Damage {{occurred}} to downed trees <b>and</b> <b>wooden</b> homes. Between 13 and 17percent of the non-native Australian pine on San Salvador Island experienced damage, primarily from snapping, though some browning from salt spray was noted. Several feet of water flooded the international airport at Freeport.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{was light}} in Maryland. Some sand dunes <b>and</b> <b>wooden</b> {{structures}} were damaged, and above-normal tides occurred. In New Jersey, high winds caused power outages and knocked down trees and power lines. Minor coastal flooding of streets and houses was reported. Otherwise, {{damage in the}} state was minor.|$|E

After opening in 1846, it was rebuilt in 1872 along the new classical Victorian era civil engineering lines, with screw piles made from iron, steel supporting girders <b>and</b> a <b>wooden</b> deck. In 1895, works extended its deck length to 570 ft, with a T-shaped pontoon end, a pavilion, and added a [...] railway baggage line.|$|R

5|$|The {{interior}} of the church houses an original wooden iconostasis {{in front of the}} altar. Carved {{in the second half of}} the 14th century, the iconostasis has a basic shape. It is constructed of thick beams <b>and</b> <b>wooden</b> boards, on which traces of painting are visible, and has three openings.|$|E
5|$|When the IRT subway {{debuted in}} 1904, the typical tunnel {{construction}} method was cut-and-cover. The street was torn up to dig the tunnel below before being rebuilt from above. Traffic {{on the street}} above would be interrupted due to the digging up of the street. Temporary steel <b>and</b> <b>wooden</b> bridges carried surface traffic above the construction.|$|E

It is used for making furniture, tool handles, boxes, ladders, musical instruments, bows, weapons, matches, clothes pegs, brooms, shoes, baskets, turnery, carving, toys, pencils, rollers, cogs, wooden screws, barrels, coffins, skittles, veneers, artificial limbs, oars, skis, wooden spoons, sports equipment <b>and</b> <b>wooden</b> balls.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, the {{elements}} {{characteristic of the}} style include: the ogival, redented towers shaped like lotus buds; half-galleries to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are devatas (or apsaras), bas-reliefs, and on pediments extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work. Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including gilded stucco on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, <b>and</b> <b>wooden</b> ceiling panels and doors.|$|E
5|$|Boy Scout {{leaders who}} {{complete}} training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized {{by a system}} of awards.

5|$|Constructed in 1878, the Foster–Payne House is {{a two-story}} {{home with a}} {{low-pitched}} multi-gabled roof. The house has a single story open porch on the western side, a kitchen ell that projects from the rear and a single-story bay window that projects from the western bay of the front facade. The house is distinguished by its clapboard exterior <b>and</b> <b>wooden</b> trim under the gable peaks, the window trim and the porch brackets. There are three types of windows used on the house, single and paired one-over-one windows and two-over-two windows.|$|E
5|$|Goodrich Castle was {{probably}} built by Godric of Mappestone after the Norman invasion of England, initially as an earth <b>and</b> <b>wooden</b> fortification. In {{the middle of}} the 12th century the original castle was replaced with a stone keep, and was then expanded significantly during the late 13th century into a concentric structure combining luxurious living quarters with extensive defences. The success of Goodrich's design influenced many other constructions across England over the following years. It became the seat of the powerful Talbot family before falling out of favour as a residence in late Tudor times.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, the {{jubilee year}} of the orphanage’s founding, a fire {{destroyed}} the third floor <b>and</b> <b>wooden</b> roof of the main building, and damaged the second floor where the church was housed. Ludwig Schneller, a son of the founder who was the administrator at the time, managed to collect over 200,000 marks in donations from Germany and rebuilt the entire structure. The upper story of the building was rebuilt in stone.|$|E

5|$|In December 2015, it was {{announced}} that a research team from University of Sydney had found a previously unseen ensemble of buried towers built and demolished during the construction of Angkor Wat, as well as massive structure of unknown purpose on its south side <b>and</b> <b>wooden</b> fortifications. The findings also include evidence of low-density residential occupation in the region, with a road grid, ponds and mounds. These indicate that the temple precinct, bounded by moat and wall, may not have been used exclusively by the priestly elite, as was previously thought. The team used LiDAR, ground-penetrating radar and targeted excavation to map Angkor Wat.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the {{stations}} on the Sognsvann Line were rebuilt. The platforms were lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains and the platform height was increased. The third rail {{made it impossible}} to cross the line at-grade; an underpass was therefore constructed at Berg station. The station was also redesigned in concrete with steel columns <b>and</b> <b>wooden</b> sheds designed by architect Arne Henriksen.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} {{industrial}} development in Minneapolis was tied to St. Anthony Falls and the power it provided. Between 1848 and 1887, Minneapolis {{led the nation in}} sawmilling. In 1856, the mills produced 12 million board feet (28,000 m³) of lumber. That total had risen to about 91,000,000 board feet (215,000 m³) in 1869, and 960,000,000 board feet (2,270,000 m³) in 1899. During the peak of this activity, at least 13 sawmills were operating on the falls. The sawmills also supported related industries such as mills that planed and smoothed the lumber; factories that built sashes, doors, and windows; and manufacturers of shingles <b>and</b> <b>wooden</b> buckets.|$|E

5|$|Mulder, still {{restrained}} {{in his bed}} at the hospital, {{sees the}} silhouette of the monster at the window. He screams for the nurse, but she has already been bitten and opens the window to let the monster in. Scully tries to visit Mulder but the nurse refuses access. Suddenly Scully sees the nurse as a corpse, realizes that Mulder is in danger, and runs into Mulder's room. There she sees the monster {{on the wall and}} shoots at it. It leaps through the partially open window, breaking the glass <b>and</b> <b>wooden</b> frame.|$|E
5|$|Norris had {{similarly}} scouted {{settings for}} his novel and chose the upstairs {{of a building}} {{on the corner of}} Polk and California street as McTeague's dentist office, as well as many of the saloons and lunch counters in the area. Stroheim discovered that many of the locations that Norris had described, such as Polk Street, had been destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but he was able to find suitable period locations on Hayes and Laguna streets. For authenticity, Stroheim had no sets built in San Francisco and only redecorated existing locations, such as saloons, butcher shops, <b>and</b> <b>wooden</b> shacks, thus saving on construction costs.|$|E
5|$|The Bronze Age {{began in}} Scotland about 2000 BCE as new {{techniques}} of metalworking began to reach northern Britain. The creation of cairns and Megalithic monuments continued. There {{was probably a}} fall in population in this period. There is evidence of cellular round houses of stone on Shetland <b>and</b> <b>wooden</b> crannogs, roundhouses partially or entirely built on artificial islands. As elsewhere in Europe, hill forts were first introduced in this period.|$|E
