40|$|Alkynylsilver cations, RC {{equivalent}} to CAg 2 + (where R = Me and Ph) {{have been prepared}} in the gas phase using multistage mass spectrometry experiments in a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Two methods were used: (i) electrospray ionisation (ESI) of a mixture of AgNO 3 (in MeOH/H 2 O/acetic acid) and the alkyne carboxylic acid to yield the appropriate silver acetylide cations RC {{equivalent to}} CAg 2 +, via a facile decarboxylation of the RC equivalent to CCO 2 Ag 2 + precursor; (ii) ESI of silver acetylides, RCuCAg, which yields a cluster of the type, [(RC equivalent to CAg) 12 Ag 2 Cl](+). Regardless of the method of preparation, these alkynylsilver cations, RCuCAg 2 +, undergo ion-molecule reactions with <b>allyliodide</b> to yield the ionic products Ag(2) l(+) and [(RC equivalent to CCH 2 CH=CH 2) Ag](+). The CID spectrum of [(PhC equivalent to CCH 2 CH=CH 2) Ag](+) was {{compared to that of}} an authentic sample of the silver adduct of 5 -phenyl- 1 -penten- 4 -yne. Both ions fragment to yield Ag+ and the radical cation, PhC equivalent to CCH 2 CH=CH 2 +., confirming that C-C bond coupling has taken place in the gas phase. DFT calculations were carried out on these C-C bond coupling reactions for the system R = Me. The reaction is highly exothermic and involves the initial coordination of the <b>allyliodide</b> to both silver atoms, with the iodine coordinating to one atom and the alkene moiety coordinating to the other. The overall mechanism of C-C bond coupling involves oxidative addition of the <b>allyliodide</b> followed by reductive elimination of RC equivalent to CCH 2 CH=CH 2, to ultimately yield two sets of reaction products: (i) Ag(2) l(+) and RC equivalent to CCH 2 CH=CH 2; and (ii) [(RC equivalent to CCH 2 CH=CH 2) Ag](+) and Agl...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} {{asymmetric synthesis}} of beta-amino-cyclohexyl sulfonates, beta-sultams and gamma-sultones has been developed. The key {{step of the}} synthesis is the Lewis acid (zinkbromide) catalyzed aza-Michael addition of the enantiopure hydrazines (S) - 1 -amino- 2 -methoxymethyl-pyrrolidine (SAMP) or (R,R,R) - 2 -amino- 3 -methoxymethyl- 2 -azabicyclo[3. 3. 0]-octane (RAMBO) to alkenyl-cyclohexyl sulfonates. This leads to beta-hydrazino sulfonates in moderate to good yields (41 - 85 %) and diastereomeric excesses (de = 44 - 90 %). The epimers were separated by preparative chirale HPLC. Subsequent reductive N-N bond cleavage with BH 3 *THF and protection of the resulting amines with benzyloxycarbonyl-chloride (CbzCl) gave N-Cbz-protected beta-amino-cyclohexyl sulfonates in moderate to good yields (38 - 68 % over 2 steps) and high enantiomeric excesses (ee > 96 %). Alpha-alkylation of the N-Cbz-protected sulfonates with various electrophiles lead to alpha-alkyl-beta-amino-cyclohexyl sulfonates in good to excellent yields (67 - 92 %) and moderate to high diastereomeric excesses (de = 71 - 93 %). After alkylation with <b>allyliodide,</b> the first asymmetric iodosultonisation was achieved with high selectivites (de > 96 %). The N-Cbz-protected beta-amino-cyclohexyl sulfonates were also cyclized in a 4 step synthesis to highly enantioenriched 3 -substituted- 1, 2 -thiazetidine 1, 1 dioxides (beta-sultams). The reaction sequence starts with the cleavage of sulfonic esters to the corresponding sulfonic acids, followed by chlorination to yield N-Cbz-protected beta-amino-sulfonyl chlorides. After deprotection of the amino group and cyclization, the beta-sultams were obtained in excellent enantiomeric purity (ee > 96 %) ...|$|E
