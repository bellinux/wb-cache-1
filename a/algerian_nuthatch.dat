Nuthatch refers to the {{propensity}} of some species to wedge a large insect or seed in a crack and hack at it with their strong bills. Species boundaries in the nuthatches are difficult to define. The red-breasted nuthatch, Corsican nuthatch and Chinese nuthatch have breeding ranges separated by thousands of kilometres, but are similar in habitat preference, appearance and song. They were formerly considered to be one species, but are now normally split into three and comprise a superspecies along with the Krüper's and <b>Algerian</b> <b>nuthatch.</b> Unusually for nuthatches, all five species excavate their own nests.|$|E
500|$|The {{endangered}} white-browed nuthatch {{is found}} only in the Mount Victoria area of Burma, where forest up to [...] above sea level has been almost totally cleared and habitat between [...] is heavily degraded. Nearly 12,000 people live in the Natma Taung national park which includes Mount Victoria, and their fires and traps add to {{the pressure on the}} nuthatch. The population of the white-browed nuthatch, estimated at only a few thousand, is decreasing, and no conservation measures are in place. The <b>Algerian</b> <b>nuthatch</b> is found in only four areas of Algeria, and {{it is possible that the}} total population does not exceed 1,000 birds. Fire, erosion, and grazing and disturbance by livestock have reduced the quality of the habitat, despite its location in the Taza National Park.|$|E

5000|$|In the past, the red-breasted {{nuthatch}} {{and four other}} species — the Corsican nuthatch, the Chinese nuthatch, the <b>Algerian</b> <b>nuthatch</b> and the Krüper's nuthatch — {{were thought to be}} a single species. These five make up a well-defined species group known as the [...] "Sitta canadensis group", and are sometimes considered to be a superspecies. Within the species group, DNA {{studies have shown that the}} {{red-breasted nuthatch}}, the Corsican nuthatch and the Chinese nuthatch make up one clade and the <b>Algerian</b> <b>nuthatch</b> and Krüper's nuthatch make up a sister clade. The red-breasted nuthatch is monotypic across its extensive range.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Algerian</b> <b>nuthatch</b> is a {{resident}} bird of four areas of mountain forest in northeast Algeria. Its range {{is limited by}} the availability of woodland, and it occurs only above 1,000m, with the population density increasing with altitude.|$|E
50|$|The {{barbary ape}} is an {{endangered}} primate with a narrowly restricted present distribution and {{is present in}} the park. The endangered <b>Algerian</b> <b>nuthatch</b> is also present, with an estimated population of 364 individuals in a 1989 survey. The park is also known for its birds of prey.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{the genus}} the Corsican {{nuthatch}} {{belongs to the}} canadensis group which also includes the red-breasted nuthatch (S. canadensis), the Chinese nuthatch (S. villosa), Krüper's nuthatch (S. krueperi) and the <b>Algerian</b> <b>nuthatch</b> (S. ledanti). [...] These six species usually excavate their own nests and all except the <b>Algerian</b> <b>nuthatch</b> specialize in extracting seeds from pine cones. All {{members of the group}} also exhibit sexually dimorphism in the colour of their head feathers. Analysis of ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA indicated that the Corsican nuthatch is most closely related to the Chinese nuthatch and that they diverged from a common ancestor around 0.96 million years ago. [...] The large distance separating the ranges of the two sister species is very unusual for Palaearctic passerines. The Yunnan nuthatch is a sister species to the canadensis group and has many common features.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Algerian</b> <b>nuthatch</b> (Sitta ledanti) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{which is}} the only bird species endemic to Algeria, where it is also the only nuthatch. It was first discovered on October 5, 1975 at the Djebel Babor mountain in the Petite Kabylie range in northern Algeria, by a team led by a young Belgian agronomist Jean-Pierre Ledant.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Algerian</b> <b>nuthatch</b> is 13.5 cm long, {{slightly}} {{smaller than the}} Eurasian nuthatch, and has the typical nuthatch big head, short tail and powerful bill and feet. It is blue-grey above, and buff below. The male has a black crown and eyestripe separated by a white supercilium. The female has a grey crown and eyestripe. Young birds are duller versions of the adults.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} of medium size {{compared}} with other nuthatches, measuring 13.5 cm in length. The folded wing measures 75 - 83 mm in males and 75 - 85 mm in females. The tail is 41 - 45 mm in males and from 39.5 mm to 46 mm in females. The beak measures from 16.1 - 17.6 mm in length, and the tarsus 15 - 18 mm. The weight is not known, but may be comparable to the <b>Algerian</b> <b>nuthatch</b> (Sitta ledanti), which also measures 13.5 cm long, and weighs between 16.6 g and 18 g.|$|E
