5|$|Funerary poems {{were thought}} to {{preserve}} a monarch's soul in death. The Pyramid Texts are the earliest surviving religious literature incorporating poetic verse. These texts do not appear in tombs or pyramids originating before the reign of Unas (r. 2375–2345 BC), who had the Pyramid of Unas built at Saqqara. The Pyramid Texts are chiefly concerned with the function of preserving <b>and</b> <b>nurturing</b> {{the soul of the}} sovereign in the afterlife. This aim eventually included safeguarding both the sovereign and his subjects in the afterlife. A variety of textual traditions evolved from the original Pyramid Texts: the Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom, the so-called Book of the Dead, Litany of Ra, and Amduat written on papyri from the New Kingdom until the end of ancient Egyptian civilization.|$|E
5|$|Kameo {{is known}} for its {{prolonged}} development cycle, which spanned four Nintendo and Microsoft consoles. It was conceived as a Pokémon-style game of capturing <b>and</b> <b>nurturing</b> monsters, but traded its lighthearted Nintendo overtones for darker themes more befitting of Xbox audiences when Microsoft acquired the developer. In this process, Kameo was repurposed from a fairy to an elf—a transition the game's director later concluded was unsuccessful. While nearly finished for the original Xbox console, the title was delayed to become an exclusive launch title for the upcoming Xbox 360. Rare used the extra time to improve the game's audiovisuals, including Rare's first orchestral soundtrack, and add a local cooperative multiplayer mode. Kameo released alongside the Xbox 360 launches: November 2005 in North America and several weeks later in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Koht's {{views on}} the Norwegian {{language}} also garnered him nationwide academic recognition. He championed the Samnorsk language reform, the declared aim of which was to consolidate the two standards of written Norwegian. A reform pushing the formal written language in this direction was indeed implemented in 1938, but historical events led {{to the failure of}} this policy. A pertinacious and unyielding advocate of international peace, Koht was {{a founding member of the}} Norwegian Peace Association and an ordinary member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. As an activist and politician he was described as a strong-willed and individualistic, <b>and</b> <b>nurturing</b> a strong belief in taking an academic and legal perspective on political problems.|$|E

40|$|This paper advocates redefining {{parenting}} {{in terms}} of commitment <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> rather than biological affinity. Legal precedents involve a geneological bias, but this is unrealistic {{in the light of}} the increasing variety of modes of reproduction now open to prospective parents. Commitment <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> favor social rather than biological affinity as the foundation of family life. Whether we can insist on commitment <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> as conditions of “parenting” is moot, hinging on whether parenting is viewed as a privilege or a right. However that question is resolved, justice demands that artificial insemination by donor and natural parents be treated alike...|$|R

Also a trait found all over Asia was the preference of most families to have male children instead of females.|$|E

40|$|Nature <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> {{are popular}} <b>and</b> well known {{concepts}} in both {{popular culture and}} science. The debate between nature <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> proponents about {{which of the two}} is the most important originator of phenotypes has been silent for decades. Instead, a compromise has been reached where everyone has agreed that most if not all phenotypes originate from a combination of nature <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> influences. In recent years, considerable scientific evidence suggests that during a specific timeframe in very early life, nature <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> interact with each other by epigenetic mechanisms. Nurture effects on the mother are shown to cause dramatically differing phenotypes in offspring. This paper proposes a model that incorporates the perinatal environment as a bridge between nature <b>and</b> <b>nurture.</b> It will be argued that this model is a better representation of reality than the existing non-dualistic model. The paper will focus on the ways changes in the perinatal environment affect the etiology of Syndrome X. With syndrome X prevalence rapidly rising, attempts to better understand its causes are very important. The first chapter will better define nature <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> in traits <b>and</b> states and introduce the nature – PNE – nurture model. The mechanisms of epigenetic changes in gene expression will be examined thereafter. The paper concludes with a chapter providing insight into specific sites of DNA methylation (an important epigenetic mechanism) that have been associated with syndrome X etiology. ...|$|R

Kibbutzim typically offer theatre companies, choirs, orchestras, athletic leagues, and special-interest classes. In 1953 Givat Brenner staged the play My Glorious Brothers, about the Maccabee revolt, building a real village on a hilltop as a set, planting real trees, and performing for 40,000 people. Following kibbutz work practices of the time, all the actors were members of the kibbutz, and all performed as part of their work assignments.|$|E

She is the mother goddess in Hinduism, and has many attributes and aspects. Each of her aspects is expressed with a different name, giving her over 100 names in regional Hindu stories of India. Along with Lakshmi (goddess of wealth and prosperity) and Saraswati (goddess of knowledge and learning), she forms the trinity of Hindu goddesses (Tridevi).|$|E
25|$|Gay activist Jonathan Rauch {{has argued}} that {{marriage}} is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity. The data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to mixed-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and mixed-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated {{to their ability to}} provide a healthy <b>and</b> <b>nurturing</b> family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex parents and carers and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, {{traditional}} attachment theory {{holds that}} the provision of a safe and predictable environment and caregiver qualities such as sensitivity, responsiveness to children's physical and emotional needs and consistency, support the development of healthy attachment. Therapy based on this viewpoint emphasizes providing a stable environment and taking a calm, sensitive, non-intrusive, non-threatening, patient, predictable, <b>and</b> <b>nurturing</b> approach toward children. Further, as attachment patterns develop within relationships, methods to correct problems with attachment focus on improving the stability and positive qualities of the caregiver-child interactions and relationship. All mainstream interventions with an existing or developing evidential foundation focus on enhancing caregiver sensitivity, creating positive interactions with caregivers, or change of caregiver if that is not possible with existing caregivers. Some interventions focus specifically on increasing caregiver sensitivity in foster parents.|$|E
25|$|According to the APSAC Task Force, {{there are}} controversies within the {{attachment}} therapy community about coercive practices. There {{has been a}} move away from coercive and confrontational models towards attunement and emotional regulation amongst some leaders in the field, notably Hughes, Kelly and Popper. A number of therapies are quite different from those {{that have led to}} the abuse and deaths of children in much publicized court cases. The Task Force, however, points out that all the therapies, including those using frankly coercive practices, present themselves as humane, respectful <b>and</b> <b>nurturing,</b> therefore caution is advised. Some practitioners condemn the most dangerous techniques but continue to practice other coercive techniques. Others have taken a public stand against coercion. The Task Force was of the view that all could benefit from more transparency and specificity as to how the therapy is behaviorally delivered.|$|E
