Conidial yields varied with the mycological media, but the viability <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> of conidia against mosquitoes produced on all substrates were similar when spores were stored under the same conditions. The storage conditions were more critical to spore survival <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> than the substrate upon which conidia were produced. The comparison of rice types for conidial production indicated that conidial yield, viability, <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> to mosquitoes were more dependent upon the moisture level during growth and on the storage conditions that upon the rice used.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between parasite fitness <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> {{has been the}} object of experimental and theoretical studies often with conflicting conclusions. Here, we provide direct experimental evidence that viral fitness <b>and</b> <b>virulence,</b> both measured in the same biological environment provided by host cells in culture, can be two unrelated traits. A biological clone of foot-and-mouth disease virus acquired high fitness <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> (cell killing capacity) upon large population passages in cell culture. However, subsequent plaque-to-plaque transfers resulted in profound fitness loss, but only a minimal decrease of virulence. While fitness-decreasing mutations have been mapped throughout the genome, virulence determinants-studied here with mutant and chimeric viruses-were multigenic, but concentrated on some genomic regions. Therefore, we propose a model in which viral virulence is more robust to mutation than viral fitness. As a consequence, depending on the passage regime, viral fitness <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> can follow different evolutionary trajectories. This lack of correlation is relevant to current models of attenuation <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> in that virus de-adaptation need not entail a decrease of virulence...|$|R

40|$|The ATP-dependent caseinolytic proteases (Clp) are {{fundamental}} for stress tolerance <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> in many pathogenic bacteria. The role of ClpC in the autolysis <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> of Streptococcus pneumoniae is controversial.

ClpC is required for the release of autolysin A and pneumolysin in serotype 2 S. pneumoniae strain D 39. In vivo, ClpC is required for the growth of the pneumococcus in the lungs and blood in a murine model of disease, but it does not affect the overall outcome of pneumococcal disease.

40|$|Aims: To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between luminescence, autoinducer production <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> of pathogenic vibrios. Methods and Results: Luminescence, quorum sensing signal production <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> towards brine shrimp nauplii of 13 Vibrio campbellii and Vibrio harveyi strains were studied. Although {{only two of the}} tested strains were brightly luminescent, all of them were shown to produce the three different types of quorum sensing signals known to be produced by Vibrio harveyi. Cell-free culture fluids of all strains significantly induced bioluminescence in the cholerae autoinducer 1, autoinducer 2 and harveyi autoinducer 1 reporter strains JAF 375, JMH 597 and JMH 612, respectively. There was no relation between luminescence and signal production <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> towards brine shrimp. Conclusions: There is a large difference between different strains of Vibrio campbellii and Vibrio harveyi with respect to bioluminescence. However, this is not reflected in signal production <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> towards gnotobiotic brine shrimp. Moreover, {{there seems to be no}} relation between quorum sensing signal production <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> towards brine shrimp. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results presented here indicate that strains that are most brightly luminescent are not necessarily the most virulent ones and that the lower virulence of some of the strains is not due to a lack of autoinducer production...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Staphylococcus aureus is major {{human and}} animal pathogen. Plasmids often carry {{resistance}} genes <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> genes that can disseminate through S. aureus populations by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mechanisms. Sequences of S. aureus plasmids {{in the public domain}} and data from multi-strain microarrays were analysed to investigate (i) the distribution of resistance genes <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> genes on S. aureus plasmids, and (ii) the distribution of plasmids between S. aureus lineages. Results A total of 21 plasmid rep gene families, of which 13 were novel to this study, were characterised using a previously proposed classification system. 243 sequenced plasmids were assigned to 39 plasmid groups that each possessed a unique combination of rep genes. We show some resistance genes (including ermC <b>and</b> cat) <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> genes (including entA, entG, entJ, entP) were associated with specific plasmid groups suggesting there are genetic pressures preventing recombination of these genes into novel plasmid groups. Whole genome microarray analysis revealed that plasmid rep, resistance <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> genes were associated with S. aureus lineages, suggesting restriction-modification (RM) barriers to HGT of plasmids between strains exist. Conjugation transfer (tra) complex genes were rare. Conclusion This study argues that genetic pressures are restraining the spread of resistance <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> genes amongst S. aureus plasmids, and amongst S. aureus populations, delaying the emergence of fully virulent and resistant strains. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePathogenic Leptospira strains are {{responsible}} for leptospirosis, a worldwide emerging zoonotic disease. These spirochetes are unique amongst bacteria because of their corkscrew-like cell morphology and their periplasmic flagella. Motility is reported as an important virulence determinant, probably favoring entry and dissemination of pathogenic Leptospira in the host. However, proteins constituting the periplasmic flagella and their role in cell shape, motility <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> remain poorly described. In this study, we characterized a spontaneous L. interrogans mutant strain lacking motility, correlated {{with the loss of}} the characteristic hook-shaped ends, <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> in the animal model. Whole genome sequencing allowed the identification of one nucleotide deletion in the fliM gene resulting in a premature stop codon, thereby preventing the production of flagellar motor switch protein FliM. Genetic complementation restored cell morphology, motility <b>and</b> <b>virulence</b> comparable to those of wild type cells. Analyses of purified periplasmic flagella revealed a defect in flagella assembly, resulting in shortened flagella compared to the wild type strain. This also correlated with a lower amount of major filament proteins FlaA and FlaB. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that FliM is required for full and correct assembly of the flagella which is essential for motility <b>and</b> <b>virulence...</b>|$|R
