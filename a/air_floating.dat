5000|$|Quick Draw (voiced by Daws Butler) {{was usually}} {{depicted}} as a sheriff in these short films set in the American Old West. Quick Draw was often accompanied by his deputy, a Mexican burro called Baba Looey (voiced by Daws Butler). Although technically the side-kick, or deputy, to the main character of Sheriff Quick Draw, Baba Looey is often portrayed as the more thoughtful half of the duo; at times realizing some detail about a given situation and trying desperately without success to caution Quick Draw of a trap or other danger. The exchange would always go as follows: Baba Looey would see a fatal flaw in Quick Draw's plan, and begin voicing a warning such as [...] "I don' thin' we should be doing...", to which Quick Draw would angrily interrupt with his frequent catchphrase, [...] "I'll do the 'thin'in' around here, Baba Looey!"

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the phenomenon of}} free movement of buffle bodies in a fluid. The basis of hydraulic design of many technical devices (septic tanks, aeration and flotation chambers, hydro-and pneumatic transport, etc.) is the deposition rate (or floating) of the various bodies in the fluid. The solution of objective is obtained by the methods of mathematical modeling only at very low Reynolds numbers. Physical modeling of the phenomena {{is based on the}} results of fixed bodies flowed by oncoming external flow study. But from the standpoint of modern physical modeling methods the body, which moves freely, and the fixed body, streamlined at the same rate, represent two different phenomena: at the first variant speed is not known beforehand, at the second - it is originally given. Consequently, at the first variant there is no criterion between similarity numbers. The paper shows how the criteria are obtained from similarity numbers. Decisions are based on the similarity theory. The numbers, similarity criteria and criterial equations are determined. Proposed dependences have generalizing properties, if the conditions belong to the same class. In case of equal numbers of similarity, such phenomena are described by the same dependencies. They include: deposition of heavy particles in the air and water environments, the water droplets in the <b>air,</b> <b>floating</b> bubbles in the water, etc...|$|E
40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) classification {{in power}} cable accessories and high voltage equipment {{in general is}} essential in evaluating {{the severity of the}} damage in the insulation. In this article, the PD classification was realised as a two-fold process. Firstly, measurements taken from a high-frequency current transformer (HFCT) sensor were represented as features by means of a transformation to the classifier and secondly, the probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifier itself was capable of effectively recognising features coming from different types of discharges. The feature that was used as a fingerprint for PD characterisation was extracted from the moments of the probability density function (PDF) of the wavelet coefficients at various scales, obtained through the wavelet packets transformation. The PNN classifier was used to classify the PDs and assess the suitability of this feature vector in PD classification. Four types of artificial PDs were created in a high voltage laboratory, namely corona discharge in <b>air,</b> <b>floating</b> discharge in oil, internal discharge in oil and surface discharge in air, at different applied voltages, and were used to train the PNN algorithm. The results obtained here (97. 49, 91. 9, 100 and 99. 8 % for the corona, the floating, the internal and the surface discharges, respectively) are very encouraging for the use of PNN in PD classification with this particular feature vector. This article suggests a feature extraction and classification algorithm for PD classification, which when combined together reduced the dimensionality of the feature space to a manageable dimension, and achieved very high levels of classification...|$|E
40|$|The Support Vector Machine (SVM) {{method has}} been used with success in {{classifying}} Partial Discharge (PD) data of different sources. In this work it was investigated whether the previous success of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) could be extended to the case where a PD measurement was corrupted by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). Data was collected from experiments using PDs of different sources under controlled laboratory conditions at the Tony Davies High Voltage Laboratory, University of Southampton. Artificial PD signals were injected into the HV electrode of a bushing and a high frequency current transformer (HFCT) was used to monitor the current between the tap-point and earth. The signals produced by four different artificial PD sources (corona discharge in <b>air,</b> <b>floating</b> discharge in oil, internal discharge in oil and surface discharge in air) were acquired using the peak detection mode of the oscilloscope and were processed to extract the feature that was used by each algorithm. The feature extraction algorithm involved {{the use of the}} Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) on phase synchronous measurements corrupted by artificial AWGN. Once the SVM was trained using part of the data acquired in the laboratory then the remaining data was corrupted by noise of two different amplitudes, giving SNRs of 7 dB and 3 dB. These noisy data were classified using the SVM and the classification results were recorded. This procedure validated the SVM as an effective classification method that can be trained using laboratory noise free PD signals which can subsequently be used to classify field on-line measurements that have been corrupted with noise...|$|E
