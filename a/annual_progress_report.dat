In 2006, Nestlé adopted the CSV approach, focusing on three areas– nutrition, water and rural development– as these are core to their business activities. Nestlé now publishes an <b>annual</b> <b>progress</b> <b>report</b> on its goals. Nestlé also established the Creating Shared Value Prize, which is awarded every other year with the aim of rewarding the best examples of CSV initiatives worldwide and to encourage other companies to adopt a shared value approach. These initiatives should take {{a business}}-oriented approach in addressing challenges in nutrition, water or rural development. The winner can win up to CHF 500,000. Nestlé was an early mover in the shared value space and hosts a global forum, the Creating Shared Value Global Forum.|$|E

After the seizure Morton Abramowitz and Eric Edelman, former U.S. ambassadors to Turkey, condemned President Erdoğan's actions in an opinion piece published by the Washington Post: [...] "Clearly, democracy cannot flourish under Erdoğan now." [...] "The overall pace of reforms in Turkey has not only slowed down but in some key areas, such as freedom of expression and {{the independence of the}} judiciary, there has been a regression, which is particularly worrying," [...] rapporteur Kati Piri said in April 2016 after the European Parliament passed its <b>annual</b> <b>progress</b> <b>report</b> on Turkey.|$|E
2500|$|Originally Croatia {{had been}} {{aiming for a}} 2007 {{accession}} date, which would have broken Slovakia's record of 2.5 years of negotiations to complete the process. However, negotiations {{turned out to be}} tougher than expected. On 5 November 2008, the European Commission's <b>annual</b> <b>progress</b> <b>report</b> on Croatia's candidacy was published. Olli Rehn stated that the country should aim to complete accession negotiations by the end of 2009, with membership following by 2011 at the latest. In 2009 it was also reported that Iceland may be fast-tracked into the European Union, and Rehn said that [...] "the EU prefers two countries joining at the same time rather than individually. If Iceland applies shortly and the negotiations are rapid, Croatia and Iceland could join the EU in parallel". The last non-acquis hurdle to membership, the maritime border dispute with Slovenia, was overcome in November 2009.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>annual</b> <b>progress</b> <b>reports</b> {{produced by}} government departments and offices. The Public Service Management Act, 1997 mandates {{the publication of}} <b>progress</b> <b>reports</b> to illustrate <b>progress</b> {{in the implementation of}} strategy statements. International experience in the assessment of annual performance reports is drawn on to help determine criteria against which to judge the quality and relevance of <b>annual</b> <b>progress</b> <b>reports.</b> Three main criteria (with sub-criteria) are used in the review: accessibility, quality of performance reporting and promotion of learning. The review examines <b>annual</b> <b>progress</b> <b>reports</b> produced covering the years 1998 and 1999. From this review of experience to date with the first two rounds of <b>annual</b> <b>progress</b> <b>reports,</b> a number of limitations in current practice are identified. Among the issues highlighted in the review, the following are of particular concern. · Only just over half the departments and offices surveyed produced a <b>progress</b> <b>report</b> annually. · In several reports, due to the way information is presented, it is difficult if not impossible to assess progress against the objectives and strategies as contained in the strategy statement. · Nearly all the reporting is activity- and output-based. It is not possible in most cases to form a judgement as to what is happening {{as a result of this}} activity i. e. the results. · Little use is made of comparative data to put <b>progress</b> <b>reporting</b> in context. Year-onyear trends are infrequently used, but are the most common source of comparative data. The level of performance is rarely contrasted with expected performance levels. · Reports are generally data-deficient, with little use of performance information or performance indicators. In some cases where performance indicators have been listed in strategy statements, they are not subsequently used in the <b>progress</b> <b>reports.</b> · Reports focus almost exclusively on listing achievements. There is little in the way of balanced discussion or identification of areas where progress has not been made. There is little or no discussion in reports on the continued relevance of objectives and strategies. Some objectives and strategies are simply not reported on. In other cases, new objectives and strategies are included in the reports, but there is no discussion of why this is done. · Many reports give little sense of what lessons are being learned from implementation and from changes in the environment. The current state of play with regard to <b>annual</b> <b>progress</b> <b>reports</b> on the implementation of strategy statements is disappointing. In general, the reports do not provide a sufficiently balanced and informed picture of how departments and offices are progressing against agreed objectives and strategies. The widespread absence of data, and focus on activity reporting, makes assessment of performance difficult if not impossible in many cases. If <b>annual</b> <b>progress</b> <b>reports</b> are to be a useful part of the public accountability process,they will need to change. In particular, three issues are identified which require further consideration: · the development of guidance on the role of <b>annual</b> <b>progress</b> <b>reports</b> and ongoing central support. This guidance should not be over prescriptive. If it is, there is a danger that it will lead to routine form-filling exercises. · the establishment of appropriate quality assurance systems and procedures to assure the quality of information in <b>annual</b> <b>progress</b> <b>reports.</b> Independent, external validation of reports should be considered. The Comptroller and Auditor General may have a role to play here. Care is needed to avoid over-bureaucratic and blameapportioning approaches. The emphasis should be on promoting good practice. · the encouragement of active use of <b>annual</b> <b>progress</b> <b>reports</b> by the Oireachtas, citizens, and management and staff of departments and offices. More use of reports in the management and accountability of departments and offices will lead to more pressure to improve the information contained in <b>annual</b> <b>progress</b> <b>reports...</b>|$|R
