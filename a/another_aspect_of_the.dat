5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hospice {{philosophy}} {{is that the}} care is patient-centered, to treat the whole patient. Many healthcare agencies in the US market themselves as patient-centered; for hospice, this patient-directed care is integral and interwoven throughout the care which is provided. Related Medicare regulations reflect this philosophy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> double burden in Africa is {{that there}} is class divide, meaning that most white families, {{including}} poor ones, employ Africans either as a live-in worker or a part-time worker. In addition, because of the urban house shortage, oftentimes relatives and friends are given room and board in exchange for unpaid work, alleviating work for some.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Supreme Court {{majority}} {{upheld the}} validity of <b>another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law as enacted by Congress: that the government could assume that a potentially expatriating act had been performed voluntarily and that any claim that a person had acted under duress {{was up to the}} person involved to establish by preponderance of evidence.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{important}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Continental {{model is}} the disability pensions.|$|R
50|$|Time {{constraints}} were <b>another</b> challenging <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project. The architects {{were given}} a year to design, document and construct this building.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> unique <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> - {{reaction}} {{is that there}} is only one reactant, which must be taken into account when calculating the reaction rate.|$|R
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventh {{generation}} {{was the beginning}} of direct competition between dedicated handheld gaming devices, and increasingly powerful PDA/cell phone devices such as the iPhone and iPod Touch, and the latter being aggressively marketed for gaming purposes. Simple games such as Tetris and Solitaire had existed for PDA devices since their introduction, but by 2009 PDAs and phones had grown sufficiently powerful to where complex graphical games could be implemented, with the advantage of distribution over wireless broadband.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kakapo's {{breeding}} {{system is}} that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> portraits on the Makkotai coins {{are that}} they do not have {{identical}} head sizes and some facial features also vary from one coin to another, even though they all have the same written legend. Such an observation has been made of coins assigned to the Western Kshatrapas of Gujarat, which are thought to be another inspiration for the Chera coins. Scholars who analyzed the varying portraiture on the Kshatrapa coins have advanced several theories to explain the phenomenon: that the coins could be of different kings who chose to keep the name of an ancestor on their coins or the coins all belong to one king with portraits depicting him at his different ages. Based on such theories, the Chera coins could either belong to a series of rulers or to a single king called Cheraman Makkotai.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> useful <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> {{soft law}} {{is that it}} often {{can be used to}} {{evidence}} opinio juris on applying or interpreting a treaty.|$|R
5000|$|The {{movie is}} based on <b>the</b> premise <b>of</b> dream {{interpretation}} with emphasis on magic realism. Time travel is <b>another</b> significant <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movie. The locations include Nainital, Kerala and Nepal.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> {{important}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act is that {{it allowed}} injured sailors to obtain compensation from their employers for <b>the</b> negligence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> owner, the captain, or fellow members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crew.|$|R
5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} {{by a team}} consisting of Motoi Sakuraba, Yuzo Koshiro, Masafumi Takada, Noriyuki Iwadare, Takahiro Nishi, and Yasunori Mitsuda. Nishi acted as the music director, while orchestration was handled by Mitsuda and his studio assistant Natsumi Kameoka. Early in the game's development, Sakurai and Nishi were in discussions about what the style of Uprisings music would be, and which composers to hire for it. The composers were those who had contributed most prominently to Super Smash Bros. Brawl. The music involved both live orchestral music, synthesized tracks, and tracks that combined both musical styles. The air battle themes were created to match the dialogue and action on-screen, which was stated early on {{to be an important}} goal. <b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music, as noted by Koshiro, was that it should stand out while not interfering with dialogue. Sakuraba and Koshiro were brought in fairly early, and thus encountered difficulties with creating their music. Sakuraba recalled that he needed to rewrite the opening theme multiple times after his first demo clashed with the footage he saw due to his not knowing much about the game's world. Takada came on board when there was an ample amount of footage, but was shocked when he saw gameplay from the game's fifth chapter and tried to create suitable music within Sakurai's guidelines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> untyped lambda {{calculus}} {{is that it}} does not distinguish between different kinds of data.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} World War II in 1945, the Empire of Japan {{surrendered}} {{control of}} Taiwan and its island groups to the Allied Forces, and Taiwan was placed under the Republic of China's administrative control. The legitimacy of this transfer is disputed and is <b>another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disputed political status of Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{distinctive}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{show was}} a joke in between the casting credits {{at the beginning and}} a satirically reworded popular Hindi film song played at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> every episode.|$|R
30|$|<b>Another</b> {{important}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stabilisation is <b>the</b> regularisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hessian in <b>the</b> step SOLVE <b>of</b> Subsection ‘Numerical algorithms’. In <b>the</b> three-well problem <b>of</b> Subsection ‘Three-well benchmark’, the unstabilised adaptive algorithms fail.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{important}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tomb {{is that it}} {{is identical}} both in the front and the rear. Unlike other Mughal era structures, the back entrance is not a dummy but an actual entrance.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medieval Inquisition is {{that little}} {{attention}} {{was paid to}} sorcery. In fact several Popes were suspected of having a strong interest or practicing alchemy and it was only with Pope John XXII, who was himself suspected of being a magician, that sorcery became another form of heresy and thus liable to prosecution by the Inquisition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beyond mission are the {{engineering}} challenges of operating Spitzer in its progressing orbital phase. As the spacecraft moves farther from Earth {{on the same}} orbital path from the Sun, its antenna must point at increasingly higher angles to communicate with ground stations; this change in angle imparts more and more solar heating on the vehicle while its solar panels receive less sunlight.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{internationalization}} {{of banking}} {{has been the}} emergence of international banking consortia. Since 1964 various banks had formed international syndicates, and by 1971 over {{three quarters of the}} world's largest banks had become shareholders in such syndicates. Multinational banks can and do make huge international transfers of capital not only for investment purposes but also for hedging and speculating against exchange rate fluctuations.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} <b>the</b> design issues <b>of</b> support layer <b>of</b> timing belts. <b>The</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{power transmission}} belts needs different manufacturing process. This requires a proper design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carrier layer, single or bifilar reinforcement cords and it affects <b>the</b> mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cord. In addition, {{there are various}} cord materials, different weave and diameters. Cord can be differently pre-impregnated with material <b>of</b> <b>the</b> belt or similar. <b>Another</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> considerations are <b>the</b> inclusion <b>of</b> additional elements in the support layer, uneven distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cord in the belt and intentional removal of cord or electrical cable entry...|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{important}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> mashup culture nowadays {{lies in the}} do-it-yourself or DIY trend. Consumers {{are turning}} into producers as well, especially due to <b>the</b> simplification <b>of</b> online tools that help creating personalized content.|$|R
3000|$|... [...]. As mentioned, {{there is}} further improvement, by {{combining}} all the systems depending on noise level. <b>Another</b> interesting <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed framework {{is that it}} could be applied to some other speech modalities by appropriate selection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> activity detector.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{work was}} its {{detailed}} {{breakdown of the}} cost structure of book publishing. Babbage took the unpopular line, from the publishers' perspective, of exposing the trade's profitability. He {{went as far as}} to name the organisers of the trade's restrictive practices. Twenty years later he attended a meeting hosted by John Chapman to campaign against the Booksellers Association, still a cartel.|$|E
25|$|Some people, {{who have}} paid {{attention}} to the governmental regulation on the Internet, mentioned <b>another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruling. April Glaser, a staff activist at the EFF, noted that the ruling had an aspect of a bar against the FCC's approach to network neutrality. Various commentators pointed to the possibility that by invoking the court's interpretation of Section 706, the FCC could expand its regulative power to the Internet thereby threatening its freedom.|$|E
25|$|Continuing {{the use of}} Nazi {{inspiration}} for the Empire, J. J. Abrams, the director of , {{has said that the}} First Order, an Imperial offshoot which serves as the main antagonist of the sequel trilogy, is also inspired by <b>another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nazi regime. Abrams spoke of how several Nazis fled to Argentina after the war and he claims that the concept for the First Order came from conversations between the scriptwriters about {{what would have happened if}} they had started working together again.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} paper <b>another</b> new <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{difference}} analysis, <b>the</b> bistability <b>of</b> higher-order differences taken from a bounded time series (discrete-time signals) is proved. Some possible applications to digital communication and signal processing in Section  2 are considered.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> {{remarkable}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Sustainable Society, was, that Stivers advocated [...] "zero population growth," [...] {{a condition}} of demographic balance where <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> people in a specified population neither grows nor declines, considered as a social aim by some.|$|R
30|$|<b>Another</b> {{important}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{study was}} to identify the most common pathogens, their incidence and their pattern of distribution as detected in the CSF and wound swab cultures during the two periods before and after application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prophylactic antibiotic protocol.|$|R
25|$|The government's {{greatest}} problem, however, {{centered on}} <b>another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> banana industry. Honduras had joined other banana-exporting nations {{in a joint}} agreement to levy an export tax on that fruit. The Honduran tax had taken effect in April 1974 but was suddenly canceled four months later. Shortly thereafter, reports began to circulate that the United Fruit Company had paid more than US$1 million to Honduran officials to secure {{the repeal of the}} tax. Prominently implicated in these accusations were López Arellano and his minister of economy and commerce.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{new design}} was the {{extensive}} use of electrically powered equipment instead of the hydraulic systems used by most aircraft manufacturers of the time. On the first two prototypes, the main landing gear was hydraulic. Starting with the third prototype, the undercarriage was operated by push buttons controlling electric motors in the wings, and was kept in position by electric up and down-locks. The armament was also loaded and fired electrically. Tank believed that service use would prove that electrically powered systems were more reliable and more rugged than hydraulics, electric lines being much less prone to damage from enemy fire.|$|E
25|$|In <b>another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{dispute over}} citizenship, {{in the summer}} of 2000 the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma voted to {{restrict}} members, according to blood quantum, to those who had one-eighth Seminole Indian ancestry, basically those who could document descent from a Seminole Indian ancestor listed on the Dawes Rolls, the federal registry established in the early 20th century. At the time, during rushed conditions, registrars had separate lists for Seminole-Indians and Freedmen. They classified those with visible African ancestry as Freedmen, regardless of their proportion of Indian ancestry or whether they were considered Indian members of the tribe at the time. This excluded some Black Seminole from being listed on the Seminole-Indian list who qualified by ancestry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> key <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Renegade Legion {{series was}} interoperability. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{games in the}} system {{included}} rules for simultaneous play with the other games, for example using the starfighters from Interceptor as support for the action {{in a game of}} Centurion.|$|R
5000|$|In 1987, McFadden {{was cast}} as Dr. Beverly Crusher on Star Trek: The Next Generation. The Crusher {{character}} was {{slated to be}} Captain Jean-Luc Picard's love interest; <b>another</b> important <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character was being a widow balancing motherhood and a career.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{trademark}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series {{would be}} the frequent on-screen presence of Rice's soundman, Dave Chapman, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camera team who followed her around as she attempted to accomplish the challenges and who often found himself having to lend a helping hand.|$|R
