5|$|In 1910 Aurobindo withdrew {{himself from}} all {{political}} activities {{and went into}} hiding at Chandannagar {{in the house of}} Motilal Roy, while the British were trying to prosecute him for sedition {{on the basis of a}} signed article titled 'To My Countrymen', published in Karmayogin. As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a French colony. The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Levin {{published}} {{his first book}} in 1970. Called The Pendulum Years, its subtitle, Britain and the Sixties, summed up its subject. In 22 self-contained chapters, Levin considered various aspects of British life during the decade. Among his topics were prominent people including Harold Macmillan and Harold Wilson – dubbed the Walrus and the Carpenter by Levin – and {{institutions such as the}} monarchy, the churches and the British Empire in its last days. Among the individual events examined in the book were the 1968 student riots <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> for obscenity of the publishers of Lady Chatterley's Lover.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial was}} {{postponed}} until January 17 because Jackalow's counsel was not {{served with the}} list of names of the jurors until the morning of January 15, and federal law required that the panel be served two full days before trial. The government planned to call 34 witnesses, and to pay each $500 for their time. Jackalow moved to compel the attendance of Dr. Theodore R. Vanck, Robert J. Dalton, and Professor George Hammell Cook of Rutgers College. Voorhees and Wilson represented Jackalow, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> was conducted by U.S. Attorney Cannon and Andrew Dutcher.|$|E

30|$|The Head of Operations Department {{added that}} in spite of the many arrests that had been made <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> {{followed}} to conclusion, the rooftop riders had remained recalcitrant and even grown hardened <b>and</b> violent. <b>The</b> menace only seems to have reduced drastically in the mornings probably because of the fear of arrest.

25|$|The Court {{found in}} Harris v.

25|$|York's public stance {{was that}} of a reformer, {{demanding}} better government <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> of the traitors who had lost northern France. Judging by his later actions, there may also have been a more hidden motive – the destruction of Somerset, who was soon released from the Tower. Although granted another office, that of Justice of the Forest south of the Trent (14 July 1447), York still lacked any real support outside Parliament and his own retainers.|$|E
40|$|In 1918, the British War Office {{introduced}} Regulation 40 D as {{an amendment}} to the Defence of the Realm Act (DORA).

This paper examines discourses on national security and female promiscuity surrounding the enactment of Regulation 40 D <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> under this controversial measure.
