40|$|Abstract. The {{rapidly growing}} {{commercial}} interest in Linked Data raises {{the prospect of}} “Linked Data spam”, which we define as “deliberately misleading information (data and links) published as Linked Data, {{with the goal of}} creating financial gain for the publisher”. Compared to conventional technologies affected by spamming, e. g. email and blogs, spammers targeting Linked Data {{may not be able to}} push information directly towards consumers, but rather may seek to exploit a lack of human involvement in automated data integration processes performed by applications consuming Linked Data. This paper aims to lay a foundation for future work addressing the issue of Linked Data spam, by providing the following contributions: i) a formal definition of spamming in Linked Data; ii) a classification of potential spamming techniques; iii) a sample dataset demonstrating these techniques, for use in evaluating <b>anti-spamming</b> mechanisms; iv) preliminary recommendations for <b>anti-spamming</b> strategies...|$|E

40|$|The {{explosive}} use {{of social}} media {{also makes it}} a popular platform for malicious users, known as social spammers, to overwhelm normal users with unwanted content. One effective way for social spammer detection {{is to build a}} classifier based on content and social network information. However, social spammers are sophisticated and adaptable to game the system with fast evolving content and network patterns. First, social spammers continually change their spamming content patterns to avoid being detected. Second, reflexive reciprocity makes it easier for social spammers to establish social influence and pretend to be normal users by quickly accumulating a large number of “human ” friends. It is challenging for existing <b>anti-spamming</b> systems based on batch-mode learning to quickly respond to newly emerging patterns for effective social spammer detection. In this paper, we present a general optimization framework to collectively use content and network information for social spammer detection, and provide the solution for efficient online processing. Experimental results on Twitter datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework...|$|E
40|$|As the {{popularity}} of the social media increases, as evidenced in Twitter, Facebook and China’s Renren, spamming activities also picked up in numbers and variety. On social network sites, spammers often disguise themselves by creating fake accounts and hijacking normal users ’ accounts for personal gains. Different from the spammers in traditional systems such as SMS and email, spammers in social media behave like normal users and they continue to change their spamming strategies to fool <b>anti-spamming</b> systems. However, due to the privacy and resource concerns, many social media websites cannot fully monitor all the contents of users, making many of the previous approaches, such as topology-based and content-classification-based methods, infeasible to use. In this paper, we propose a Supervised Matrix Factorization method with Social Regularization (SMFSR) for spammer detection in social networks that exploits both social activities as well as users ’ social relations in an innovative and highly scalable manner. The proposed method detects spammers collectively based on users ’ social actions and social relations. We have empirically tested our method on data from Renren. com, {{which is one of the}} largest social networks in China, and demonstrated that our new method can improve the detection performance significantly...|$|E

40|$|Spamming {{has been}} a {{widespread}} problem for social networks. In recent years there is an increasing interest {{in the analysis of}} <b>anti-spamming</b> for microblogs, such as Twitter. In this paper we present a systematic research on the analysis of spamming in Sina Weibo platform, which is currently a dominant microblogging service provider in China. Our research objectives are to understand the specific spamming behaviors in Sina Weibo and find approaches to identify and block spammers in Sina Weibo based on spamming behavior classifiers. To start with the analysis of spamming behaviors we devise several effective methods to collect a large set of spammer samples, including uses of proactive honeypots and crawlers, keywords based searching and buying spammer samples directly from online merchants. We processed the database associated with these spammer samples and interestingly we found three representative spamming behaviors: Aggressive advertising, repeated duplicate reposting and aggressive following. We extract various features and compare the behaviors of spammers and legitimate users with regard to these features. It is found that spamming behaviors and normal behaviors have distinct characteristics. Based on these findings we design an automatic online spammer identification system. Through tests with real data it is demonstrated that the system can effectively detect the spamming behaviors and identify spammers in Sina Weibo...|$|E
40|$|<b>Anti-spamming</b> {{has become}} one of the most {{important}} challenges to web search engines and attracted increasing attention in both industry and academia recently. Since most search engines now use link-based ranking algorithms, link-based spamming has become a major threaten. In this paper, we show that the popular link-based ranking algorithm PageRank, while being successfully used in the Google search engine, has a "zero-one gap" flaw, which can be potentially exploited to spam PageRank results easily. The "zero-one gap" problem arises from the current ad hoc way of computing the transition probabilities in the random surfing model. We propose a novel DirichletRank algorithm in a more principled way of computing these probabilities based on Bayesian estimation with a Dirichlet prior. DirichletRank is a variant of PageRank, but it does not have the problem of "zero-one gap" and is analytically shown to be substantially more resistant to link farm spams than PageRank. Simulation experiments using real web data show that, compared with the original PageRank, DirichletRank is significantly more robust against several typical link spasm and is more stable under link perturbations, in general. Moreover, experiment results also show that DirichletRank is more effective than PageRank due to its more reasonable allocation of transition probabilities. Since DirichletRank can be computed as efficiently as PageRank, it is scalable to large-scale web applications...|$|E
40|$|Today from {{security}} {{point of}} view, {{the increasing demand}} of network connectivity makes the system insecure. So we need a complement that can cope / prevent the security breaches in system. Unfortunately, in many environments, {{it may not be}} feasible to render the computer system immune to all type of intrusions. The motivation behind this project is to develop a complement system i. e. Sybil detection that can prevent all possible breaks-ins. In Sybil attack each node can be preferred to as a separate webpage that the spammer creates, and each of these webpages interlink to each other thus forming a network similar to link farms. The spamming webpages link to other nodes and thus create a huge linked for improving popularity. In this paper we are introduce anti-image spamming technique for preventing to Sybil attack to attackers. Our objective is to work on to the real time research desired scenario where the work is needed to be done. Sybil attack is one of the scenario where a work has been done to deal with Sybil attack efficiently in some of the field but still there are more has to be done which we want to carry forward with the help of spamming image detection and prevention technique with the help of image <b>anti-spamming</b> technique.

40|$|Web spammers aim {{to obtain}} higher ranks for their web pages by {{including}} spam contents that deceive search engines {{in order to}} include their pages in search results {{even when they are}} not related to the search terms. Search engines continue to develop new web spam detection mechanisms, but spammers also aim to improve their tools to evade detection. In this study, we first explore the effect of the page language on spam detection features and we demonstrate how the best set of detection features varies according to the page language. We also study the performance of Google Penguin, a newly developed anti-web spamming technique for their search engine. Using spam pages in Arabic as a case study, we show that unlike similar English pages, Google <b>anti-spamming</b> techniques are ineffective against a high proportion of Arabic spam pages. We then explore multiple detection features for spam pages to identify an appropriate set of features that yields a high detection accuracy compared with the integrated Google Penguin technique. In order to build and evaluate our classifier, as well as to help researchers to conduct consistent measurement studies, we collected and manually labeled a corpus of Arabic web pages, including both benign and spam pages. Furthermore, we developed a browser plug-in that utilizes our classifier to warn users about spam pages after clicking on a URL and by filtering out search engine results. Using Google Penguin as a benchmark, we provide an illustrative example to show that language-based web spam classifiers are more effective for capturing spam contents...|$|E
