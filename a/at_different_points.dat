Carpenter, with Troops H and L, patrolled the area aggressively and engaged several groups of warriors who were setting prairie fires upwind of the settlement <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>points.</b> Further and increasingly violent assaults {{were made by the}} Native Americans, in numbers ranging from 50 to 500 <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>points</b> of the defensive lines. The decisive feature of the engagement was a charge made by Captain Carpenter's troopers. His men routed a body of over 150 warriors, who were about to take up a commanding position in rear of other defenders.

Secure transmission of information in wireless adhoc environment is an important concern. In this paper we propose to use shared cryptography to secure message communication in adhoc network. In this approach we divide any information into multiple shares and transmit the different shares via multiple disjoint paths between any pair of communicating nodes and if possible <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> of time. <b>At</b> the receiving end the original information is reconstructed by combining the shares received via <b>different</b> paths <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>point</b> of time.

5|$|Both {{medications}} and neurorehabilitation {{have been shown}} to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed.

Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level.

5|$|While domain-specific {{accounts}} of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' hypotheses about word meanings, domain-general perspectives argue that word learning can {{be accounted for}} by general cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, which are not specific to language. Yet other theorists have proposed social pragmatic accounts, which stress the role of caregivers in guiding infants through the word learning process. According to some research, however, children are active participants in their own word learning, although caregivers may still {{play an important role in}} this process. Recently, an emergentist coalition model has also been proposed to suggest that word learning cannot be fully attributed to a single factor. Instead, a variety of cues, including salient and social cues, may be utilized by infants <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>points</b> in their vocabulary development.|$|E

Essentially, the modern concept of Iguanodontidae currently includes only Iguanodon. Groups like Iguanodontoidea are still used as unranked clades in the scientific literature, though many traditional iguanodontids are now included in the superfamily Hadrosauroidea. Iguanodon lies between Camptosaurus and Ouranosaurus in cladograms, and is probably descended from a camptosaur-like animal. At one point, Jack Horner suggested, based mostly on skull features, that hadrosaurids actually formed two more distantly related groups, with Iguanodon {{on the line to}} the flat-headed hadrosaurines, and Ouranosaurus on the line to the crested lambeosaurines, but his proposal has been rejected.|$|E
