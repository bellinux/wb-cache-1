25|$|Literary {{criticism}} (or literary studies) is the study, evaluation, {{and interpretation}} of literature. Modern literary criticism is often influenced by literary theory, which is the philosophical discussion of literature's goals and methods. Though the two activities are closely related, literary critics are not <b>always,</b> <b>and</b> have not always been, theorists.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} thermodynamics, {{a commonly}} considered {{model is the}} heat engine. It consists of four bodies: the working body, the hot reservoir, the cold reservoir, and the work reservoir. A cyclic process leaves the working body in an unchanged state, and is envisaged as being repeated indefinitely often. Work transfers between the working body and the work reservoir are envisaged as reversible, and thus only one work reservoir is needed. But two thermal reservoirs are needed, because transfer of energy as heat is irreversible. A single cycle sees energy taken by the working body from the hot reservoir {{and sent to the}} two other reservoirs, the work reservoir and the cold reservoir. The hot reservoir <b>always</b> <b>and</b> only supplies energy and the cold reservoir <b>always</b> <b>and</b> only receives energy. The second law of thermodynamics requires that no cycle can occur in which no energy is received by the cold reservoir. Heat engines achieve higher efficiency when the difference between initial and final temperature is greater.|$|E

6000|$|... "Monarchies, aristocracies, and {{religions}} are all based upon that large defect in your race--the individual's distrust of his neighbor, and his desire, for safety's or comfort's sake, to stand {{well in his}} neighbor's eye. These institutions will <b>always</b> remain, <b>and</b> <b>always</b> flourish, <b>and</b> <b>always</b> oppress you, affront you, and degrade you, because you will <b>always</b> be <b>and</b> remain slaves of minorities.

25|$|Typically, {{a player}} faces the basket {{with both feet}} facing the basket. A player will rest {{the ball on the}} {{fingertips}} of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball. The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not <b>always)</b> <b>and</b> extending the shooting arm. The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a follow-through. Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended. Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.|$|E

500|$|In the New Testament in Koine 'thelema' is used 62 times, {{twice in}} the plural ( [...] thelemata [...] ).

("Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven). In the same way the term is used in the Apostle Paul and the Church Instructor Ignatius of Antioch. For Tolli it follows that the genuine idea of Thema does not contradict the teachings of Jesus (Lit.: Tolli, 2004).|$|E
