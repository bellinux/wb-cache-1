5|$|Lithium amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} {{work well for}} the deprotonation of <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> salts, providing that not too much LiOH {{is present in the}} n-butyllithium used to make the lithium amide. Titration of lithium amide can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation of <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E

5|$|Chitinozoa (singular: chitinozoan, plural: chitinozoans) are a taxon of flask-shaped, organic walled marine microfossils {{produced}} by an as yet unknown animal. Common from the Ordovician to Devonian periods (i.e. the mid-Paleozoic), the millimetre-scale organisms are abundant in almost <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> marine sediment across the globe. This wide distribution, and their rapid pace of evolution, makes them valuable biostratigraphic markers.|$|E
5|$|The initial hot, dense {{state is}} called the Planck epoch, a brief period {{extending}} from time zero to one Planck time unit of approximately 10−43 seconds. During the Planck epoch, <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> matter and <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> energy were concentrated into a dense state, where gravitation {{is believed to have}} been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been unified. Since the Planck epoch, the Universe has been expanding to its present form, possibly with a very brief period of cosmic inflation which caused the Universe to reach a much larger size in less than 10−32 seconds.|$|E

They are erected indoors (3, 5, 9) or outdoors (2, 4, 6). The skill of managing, organising and preparing the stage for a performance is known as stagecraft (10). The audience's experience of the entertainment is affected by their expectations, the stagecraft, the type of stage, and the type and standard of seating provided.|$|E

5|$|Varroa {{destructor}} is a parasitic mite that colonizes beehives and preys on {{honey bees}} by consuming their hemolymph. Varroa mites parasitize <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> honey bees (workers, nurse bees, larvae) {{depending on their}} life cycle stage. During the phoretic stage, Varroa prefer to attach to nurse bees as this results in higher fitness leading into the reproductive stage. The mites then feed on larvae during their reproductive stage and increased fitness leads {{to an increase in}} mite fecundity (# of female offspring). Due to Varroas ability to feed on <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> honey bees, they are one of the biggest threats to colonies, especially over winter.|$|E

5|$|Although {{scientists}} began observing reduced {{populations of}} several European amphibian species {{already in the}} 1950s, awareness of the phenomenon as a global problem and its subsequent classification as a modern-day mass extinction only dates from the 1980s. By 1993, more than 500 species of frogs and salamanders present on all five continents were in decline. Today, the phenomenon of declining amphibian populations affects thousands of species in <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> ecosystems and is thus {{recognized as one of}} the most severe examples of the Holocene extinction, with severe implications for global biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|An autocannon is {{a cannon}} {{with a larger}} caliber than a machine gun, but smaller {{than that of a}} field gun. Autocannons have {{mechanisms}} to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a faster rate of fire than artillery, often approaching—and, in the case of Gatling guns, surpassing—that of a machine gun. The traditional minimum bore for autocannon—indeed, for <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> cannon, as autocannon are the lowest-caliber pieces—has remained 20mm, since World War II.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial cell membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.|$|E

London-Heathrow had seven pricing structures between 1976 and 1984. In this case it was the US carriers that went to international arbitration in 1988 and won their case.|$|E
