40|$|The <b>American</b> <b>comb</b> <b>jelly,</b> Mnemiopsis leidyi, {{was first}} noted off the central Mediterranean coast of Israel on 3 March 2009, when a swarm {{interfered}} with the operation of a desalination plant. Throughout the spring dense populations have been recorded along the entire Israeli coast. The occurrence of M. leidyi in the SE Levant is of great concern because its notorious impacts on fisheries and because its swarms clog seawater intake pipes and hamper the operation of coastal installations...|$|E
40|$|Hydrodynamic drift {{modeling}} {{was used}} to investigate the potential dispersion of Mnemiopsis leidyi from the Bornholm Basin in the Baltic Sea {{where it has been}} observed since 2007 further to the east and north. In the brackish surface layer dispersion is mainly driven by wind, while within the halocline dispersion is mainly controlled by the baroclinic flow field and bottom topography. Model runs showed that the natural spreading via deep water currents from the Bornholm Basin towards north and east is limited by topographic features and low advection velocities. Based on the information on ranges of salinity and temperature, which limit survival and reproduction of this ctenophore within the Baltic Sea, areas have been identified where the <b>American</b> <b>comb</b> <b>jelly,</b> M. leidyi could potentially survive and reproduce. While, we could show that M. leidyi might survive in vast areas of the northern Baltic Sea its reproduction is prevented by low salinity (< 10 psu) and temperature (< 12 °C). Thus, due to the combined effect of low salinity and temperature, it is not probable that M. leidyi could establish permanent populations in the central or northern Baltic Sea. However, it seems that in the southern parts of the Baltic Sea environmental conditions are suitable for a successful reproduction of M. leidyi...|$|E
40|$|The <b>American</b> brown <b>comb</b> <b>jelly,</b> Beroe ovata, {{was first}} noted off the Mediterranean coast of Israel on 10 June 2011, outside {{the port of}} Ashdod. The {{occurrence}} of B. ovata soon after its prey, Mnemiopsis leidyi, had been recorded follows the pattern of spread elsewhere, yet its presence in the warm and saline waters of the SE Levant is a surprise...|$|R

50|$|The benthic <b>comb</b> <b>jelly</b> is a <b>comb</b> <b>jelly</b> {{living in}} the Ryukyu Trench near Japan. Found {{at a depth of}} 7217 m, it is the deepest {{dwelling}} ctenophore discovered.|$|R
50|$|Lampocteis is a {{monotypic}} genus of <b>comb</b> <b>jellies,</b> {{the only}} genus in family Lampoctenidae.

5000|$|Nuda is a {{class of}} ctenophores or <b>comb</b> <b>jellies.</b> The class {{contains}} a single family, Beroidae, with two genera, Beroe and Neis, and the group is more {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "beroids". They are distinguished from other <b>comb</b> <b>jellies</b> by the complete absence of tentacles, in both juvenile and adult stages. Beroe is found in all the world's oceans and seas, and the monotypic Neis occurs only near Australia; all beroids are free-swimmers that form part of the plankton.|$|R

2500|$|Jellyfish, <b>comb</b> <b>jellies,</b> {{and related}} animals have diffuse nerve nets {{rather than a}} central nervous system. [...] In most {{jellyfish}} the nerve net is spread more or less evenly across the body; in <b>comb</b> <b>jellies</b> it is concentrated near the mouth. [...] The nerve nets consist of sensory neurons that pick up chemical, tactile, and visual signals, motor neurons that can activate contractions of the body wall, and intermediate neurons that detect patterns of activity in the sensory neurons and send signals to groups of motor neurons as a result. [...] In some cases groups of intermediate neurons are clustered into discrete ganglia.|$|R
