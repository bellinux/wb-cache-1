Desmond briefly became notorious for assaulting Bernard Levin during a live {{transmission}} of That Was The Week That Was in 1962 for writing a hostile review {{of one of}} his wife's performances. The show was [...] "An Evening of Savagery and Delight" [...] which had rave reviews at the Dublin Festival but lasted only three weeks at London's Duchess theatre and polarised audiences. On the first night <b>an</b> usherette <b>tipped</b> <b>a</b> <b>tray</b> of hot coffee into Levin's lap, which may have affected his view of the performance. Bernelle bravely posted all the bad reviews along with the good outside the theatre.The couple had three children: ...|$|R

40|$|Approximately {{two million}} waiters and waitresses in the United States depend on tips for their income. These servers {{would benefit from}} knowing and using {{techniques}} to increase their tips. This manual offers twenty such techniques. All twenty techniques listed here have been experimentally tested and found to increase tips. Not all the techniques work for all servers in all situations, but many are universally applicable. The techniques are as follows: use makeup (for waitresses); wear something unusual; introduce yourself by name; squat {{down next to the}} table; stand physically close to the customer; touch the customer; smile; compliment the customer’s food choices; repeat the order back to the customer; build the check with suggestive selling; entertain the customer; forecast good weather; write “thank you” on the check; write a patriotic message on the check; draw a picture on the check; call the customer by name; use <b>tip</b> <b>trays</b> with credit card insignia; give the customer candy; provide tipping guidelines; and play songs with pro-social lyrics. The techniques are described in detail, together with the experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness and the reasons I think they work...|$|R

30|$|A closed-form {{solution}} for a finite cantilevered sectorial plate subjected to <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> concentrated force is presented. Since the particular solution {{was not found}} in the literature, it is derived in this paper. A symmetric eigenfunction expansion is used to augment the particular solution to account for the fixed boundary conditions at the circumferential support. Deflections from the total closed-from solution are found to be in excellent agreement with deflection results from a finite element analysis; the error is always within 0.08  % for the given example. Finally, the total {{closed-form solution}}s for a cantilevered sectorial plate subjected to independent applications of <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> concentrated force, <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> bending moment, and <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> twisting moment, are compiled.|$|R

Equivalent equations, after being converted to polar coordinates, are presented below.|$|R
30|$|A closed-form {{solution}} is presented for a cantilevered sectorial plate subjected to <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> concentrated force. Since the particular solution for this {{problem was not}} found in the literature, it is derived here. Deflections from the total solution (particular plus homogeneous solutions) are compared to those from a finite element analysis and are found to be in excellent agreement, producing an error within approximately 0.08  %. Normalized closed-form deflections and slopes at the fixed support, resulting from an approximate enforcement of the boundary conditions there, deviate from zero by < 0.08  %. Finally, the total {{closed-form solution}}s for a cantilevered sectorial plate subjected to independent applications of <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> concentrated force, <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> bending moment, and <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> twisting moment, are compiled.|$|R

The ogee and swept tip blades required less torque coefficient at lower rotational speeds and roughly equivalent torque coefficient at higher rotational speeds compared with the baseline square tip blades in forward flight. The short ogee tip required higher torque coefficient at higher lift coefficients than the baseline square tip blade in the forward flight test condition...|$|R

40|$|Three {{types of}} tips for noncontact atomic force {{microscopy}} imaging, namely, <b>a</b> silicon nanopillar <b>tip,</b> <b>a</b> carbon nanopillar <b>tip,</b> and <b>a</b> fluoride cluster <b>tip,</b> are prepared for atomic resolution imaging on the CaF 2 (111) surface. The most enhanced atomic corrugation is obtained with the fluoride cluster tip prepared by gently touching the fluorite surface. Atom resolved images are much harder to obtain with the other tips. This demonstrates {{the importance of having}} <b>a</b> polar <b>tip</b> for atomic resolution imaging of an ionic surface and supports the general notion that a surface is best imaged with <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> of the same material. © 2010 American Vacuum Society...|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> foul <b>tip,</b> <b>a</b> very {{different}} type of batted ball, is <b>a</b> ball <b>tipped</b> off the bat which goes sharply and directly to the catcher's mitt or hand. If the catcher does not catch the ball, it is an ordinary foul ball. If the catcher has to move either his mitt/hand or body to catch the ball, it is not <b>a</b> foul <b>tip,</b> as the ball {{would no longer have}} traveled directly to the catch. However, if the ball deflects from either the mitt or hand and is subsequently caught before landing, it is still <b>a</b> foul <b>tip.</b> <b>A</b> foul <b>tip</b> is always <b>a</b> strike, and is a strike out if there are two strikes on the batter.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the mound}} stage of Dictyostelium discoideum, pre-stalk cells sort and form <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> at the apex. How this pattern forms {{is as yet}} unknown.

With chemotaxis driven by an outgoing circular wave only, <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> forms but contains both pre-stalk and pre-spore cells. Only for a narrow range of relative strengths between differential adhesion and chemotaxis can both mechanisms work in concert to form <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> containing only pre-stalk cells.

40|$|We use {{computer}} modeling {{to investigate}} the mechanism of atomic-scale corrugation in frequency-modulation atomic force microscopy imaging of inorganic surfaces in solution. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the forces acting on <b>a</b> microscope <b>tip</b> result from the direct interaction between <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> and <b>a</b> surface, and forces entirely due to the water structure around both tip and surface. The observed force depends on <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> structure and is a balance between largely repulsive potential energy changes as the tip approaches and the entropic gain when water is sterically prevented from occupying sites near the tip and surface.
