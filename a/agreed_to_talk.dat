5|$|On May 30, {{the accusations}} were restated, in an {{official}} communique, published by TASS, the official Soviet news agency. The same day, Stasys Lozoraitis—the Lithuanian envoy in Rome—was authorized to form a government in exile in case of the Soviet occupation. The Lithuanian police tightened security around Soviet bases and arrested 272 suspicious individuals, but that only drew additional criticism of harassment. Foreign Minister Juozas Urbšys offered to settle the matter in direct negotiations in Moscow. Molotov <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> but only with Prime Minister Antanas Merkys. On June 7, Merkys arrived in Moscow. The Soviets repeated the accusations of kidnapping. Other charges were leveled, including the allegation that Minister of the Interior Kazys Skučas and Director of State Security Department Augustinas Povilaitis had provoked Russian soldiers. During the second meeting on June 9, Molotov also accused the Lithuanian government of conspiring with Latvia and Estonia to establish a secret military union (in reference to the Baltic Entente), thereby violating the mutual assistance pact.|$|E

25|$|Bladel, {{a disgruntled}} former employee, {{had been arrested}} three months later in Indiana and extradited to Michigan. He had <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the police without counsel. At his {{arraignment}} he requested that counsel be appointed {{for him because he}} was indigent. The detective in charge of the investigation was present at the arraignment. A notice of appointment was then mailed to a law firm, but before the law firm received the notice, two police officers interviewed Bladel in the county jail and obtained a confession from him. Prior to that questioning, the officers had advised Bladel of his Miranda rights. Although Bladel had inquired about his representation several times since the arraignment, he was not told that a law firm had been appointed to represent him.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 2003, at the Charing Cross Hotel in London, Kelly met Andrew Gilligan, a BBC {{journalist}} {{who had spent}} some time writing {{about the war in}} Baghdad. Kelly was anxious to learn what had happened in Iraq, while Gilligan, who had discussed a very early draft of the dossier with Kelly, wished to ask him about it in light of the failure to find any weapons of mass destruction. They <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> on an unattributable basis, which allowed the BBC to report what was said but not to identify the source. Kelly told Gilligan of his concerns over the 45-minute claim and allegedly ascribed its inclusion in the dossier to Alastair Campbell, the director of communications for Tony Blair.|$|E

25|$|By December 1955, {{however, the}} {{committee}} was fed up once again with the state and their treatment of the NY214 reconstruction. They threatened yet another school strike after disappointed results from new Governor Averell Harriman, stating it was their only weapon left in the situation. Papp noted that a letter sent by Bellamy noted that the money was not contingent on the failed amendment. Soon after, the state canceled bids on the project, angering Wicks and New York State Assemblyman William E. Brady from Coxsackie. Angered by the decision, the parents went through with their threat to pull their children once again for a week in January1956 until Wicks and Brady <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the state. However, the state accused Papp in late January of confusing the issues over money for funding of the NY214 project. The new Superintendent for the Public Works Department, John W. Johnson noted that {{the defeat of the}} amendment was the reason for canceling the bids of December 1.|$|E
500|$|The cast began rehearsing, {{but after}} 20 minutes {{stopped and turned}} to Cherones, who <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Charles. While {{on his way to}} Charles' office, Cherones met Castle Rock {{executive}} Glenn Padnick and informed him about the cast's reaction to the episode. Cherones said that Padnick was relieved to hear this, and they both discussed the problem with Charles, and decided not to use the script. Commenting on the episode, Charles stated [...] "You know, it would have been an interesting show, but [...] we couldn't solve the funny problem of it. It never seemed to quite be as funny as it should be and, because of that, the balance was off and the darkness kind of enveloped it, and it could never really emerge from that darkness and become what it should have been. So, it was disappointing but also understandable." [...] The replacement episode called [...] "The Phone Message" [...] was written by David and Seinfeld in two days.|$|E
500|$|Austria's allies saw the {{declaration}} as {{an admission that}} Austria's diplomatic ambitions had failed, but Metternich viewed it as one move in a much longer campaign. For {{the rest of the}} war he strove to hold the Coalition together and, as such, to curb Russian momentum in Europe. To this end he won an early victory as an Austrian general, the Prince of Schwarzenberg, was confirmed supreme commander of the Coalition forces rather than Tsar Alexander I. He also succeeded in getting the three allied monarchs (Alexander, Francis and Prussia's Frederick William III) to follow him and their armies on campaign. With the Treaties of Teplitz, Metternich allowed Austria to remain uncommitted over the future of France, Italy, and Poland. He was still confined, however, by the British, who were subsidizing Prussia and Russia (in September Metternich requested subsidies for Austria as well). Meanwhile, the Coalition forces took the offensive. On 18 October 1813 Metternich witnessed the successful Battle of Leipzig and, two days later, he was rewarded for his [...] "wise direction" [...] with the rank of prince (...) [...] Metternich was delighted when Frankfurt was retaken in early November and, in particular, by the deference the Tsar showed Francis at a ceremony organised there by Metternich. Diplomatically, with the war drawing to a close, he remained determined to prevent the creation of a strong, unified German state, even offering Napoleon generous terms in order to retain him as a counterweight. On 2 December 1813 Napoleon <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> though these talks were delayed by the need for the participation of a more senior British diplomat, (Viscount Castlereagh).|$|E

2500|$|After Eric was {{reinstated}} as king, some {{factions of}} the Swedish nobility advocated war with Norway. They wanted retribution for the Norwegian plundering of Värmland. According to the Norwegian saga Sverris saga, the future jarl Birger Magnusson, {{were among those}} in favour of war; however, at the time, the de facto ruler of Sweden Jarl Ulf Fase and his supporters were against attacking Norway. To prevent mutual hostility from escalating into war, Haakon IV of Norway sent an envoy to Sweden to conciliate. The Swedes <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> and a delegation led by Birger was sent to Kungahälla in Norway. Negotiations were held {{in the spring of}} 1241, however, no agreement was reached.|$|E
60|$|Scarcely had Phoebe {{driven from}} the door, before she saw Miss Charlecote {{crossing}} the grass on foot, {{and after the}} interchange of a few words, it was <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> while driving on towards Elverslope. Each was laden with the same subject, for not only had Honor heard from Robert, but during her visit to Moorcroft she had become enlightened on the gossip that seldom reached the Holt, and had learnt that the whole neighbourhood was scandalized at the Beauchamp doings, and was therefore shy of taking notice {{of the young people}} there. She had been incredulous at first, then extremely shocked and distressed, and though in part convinced that more than she guessed had passed beyond the west wing, she had come primed with a representation which she cautiously administered to Phoebe. The girl was more indignant on her brother's account than alarmed on her own.|$|E

The alternative, in which the calling party <b>agrees</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> whoever answers the telephone, is known as station-to-station. Since the introduction of direct dial telephone service and the subsequent drop in the price of long distance telephone calls, person-to-person service has virtually disappeared.|$|R
