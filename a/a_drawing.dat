Meanwhile, Michael Dante DiMartino was interested in a documentary about explorers trapped in the South Pole, which he later combined with Konietzko's drawing.|$|E
5|$|Aposematic animals {{often have}} (honest) threat displays; edible prey {{sometimes}} have (bluffing) startle displays.

5|$|Beginning in 1747, Fownes Luttrell made {{numerous}} and significant alterations to Dunster Castle, redecorating and redesigning {{it in the}} Rococo style. He renovated the Great Parlour, converted a bedroom over it into <b>a</b> <b>Drawing</b> Room in 1758, created a Breakfast Room over the Hall in 1772, remodelled {{the southern part of}} the castle, and altered the Great Staircase in 1773. His changes to the décor of the castle are also noteworthy, particularly for his use of newly-fashionable wallpaper.|$|E

5|$|Charcoal {{is used as}} <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> {{material}} in artwork, barbecue grilling, iron smelting, and in many other applications. Wood, coal and oil are used as fuel for production of energy and heating. Gem quality diamond is used in jewelry, and industrial diamonds are used in drilling, cutting and polishing tools for machining metals and stone. Plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons, and carbon fiber, made by pyrolysis of synthetic polyester fibers is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced, lightweight composite materials.|$|E

Hiorns had retired from business and spent some of his time in Sydney. Denniston, the oldest son of Thomas Denniston and married to the daughter of John Bathgate, was a judge at the Supreme Court in Christchurch.|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes time {{constraints}} for one (or possibly both) player(s) {{to complete a}} game may {{be a factor in}} agreeing to <b>a</b> <b>draw.</b> <b>A</b> player with an advantageous position but limited time may be agreeable to <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> to avoid risking a loss from running out of time, and the opponent may also be agreeable to <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> due to his/her disadvantageous position.|$|R
2500|$|The FIDE laws {{state that}} <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> {{should be offered}} after making the move and before {{pressing}} the game clock, and marked in the scoresheet as (=) (see Appendix C.13). Draws made at any time are valid, however. If a player makes <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> offer before making their move, the opponent can ask them to make their move before deciding. Once made, <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> offer cannot be retracted, and is valid until rejected. <b>A</b> <b>draw</b> may be rejected either verbally or by making a move (the offer is nullified if the opponent makes a move). The actual offer of <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> may be made by asking directly [...] "Would you like a draw?" [...] or similar, but players frequently agree to draws by merely nodding their heads [...] [...] In international chess, the French word remis is an offer of <b>a</b> <b>draw.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, there were rumours about {{surviving}} mammoths in Alaska. In October 1899, Henry Tukeman detailed his {{killing of a}} mammoth in Alaska and his subsequent donation of the specimen to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. The museum denied the story. Bengt Sjögren believed that the myth began when the American biologist Charles Haskins Townsend travelled in Alaska, saw Eskimos trading mammoth tusks, asked if there were still living mammoths in Alaska, and provided them with <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> of the animal.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mathematics}} of graph drawing, Turán's brick factory problem asks for the {{minimum number of}} crossings in <b>a</b> <b>drawing</b> of a complete bipartite graph.

2500|$|Unless {{specific}} tournament rules forbid it, players may {{agree to}} <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> at any time. Ethical considerations may make <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> uncustomary {{in situations where}} at least one player has a reasonable chance of winning. For example, <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> could be called after a move or two, but this would likely be thought unsporting.|$|R
25|$|When a match {{ends with}} {{completion}} of the specified maximum number of rounds, and the judges of the match have awarded {{an equal amount of}} points to both contestants, or if there are three judges (as is the custom) and one judge awards the fight to one fighter, another awards the fight to the opposing fighter, and the third scores it <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> (split draw), the match is declared <b>a</b> <b>draw.</b> The contest would be scored <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> even if two of three judges score it <b>a</b> <b>draw</b> and the third does not (<b>a</b> majority <b>draw).</b> Draws are relatively rare in boxing: certain scoring systems make it impossible for a judge to award equal points for a match.
