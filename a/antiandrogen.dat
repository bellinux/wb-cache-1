5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its <b>antiandrogen</b> effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1957, was patented between 1958 and 1961, and was first marketed, as an antimineralocorticoid, in 1959. The AR antagonistic (i.e., <b>antiandrogen)</b> activity of spironolactone was first discovered and reported in 1969, which shortly followed the discovery in 1968 that gynecomastia, a frequent {{and by that}} time well-established side effect of spironolactone, is an important and major side effect of AR antagonists. The drug started to be used as an <b>antiandrogen,</b> for instance in the treatment of hirsutism in women, by the late 1970s and early 1980s, and has since become the most widely used <b>antiandrogen</b> for dermatological indications in the United States.|$|E

50|$|<b>Antiandrogens</b> {{are used}} to treat an {{assortment}} of androgen-dependent conditions. In males, <b>antiandrogens</b> {{are used in the}} treatment of prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss), hypersexuality, paraphilias, and precocious puberty. In women, <b>antiandrogens</b> {{are used to}} treat acne, seborrhea, hidradenitis suppurativa, hirsutism, and hyperandrogenism, such as that which occurs in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). <b>Antiandrogens</b> are also used as a component of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for transgender women.|$|R
50|$|<b>Antiandrogens</b> {{are used}} to prevent or reverse masculinization and to {{facilitate}} feminization in transgender women who are undergoing HRT and who have not undergone sex reassignment surgery or orchiectomy. Besides estrogens, the main <b>antiandrogens</b> {{that have been used}} for this purpose are cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and GnRH analogues. Nonsteroidal <b>antiandrogens</b> like bicalutamide are also used for this indication. In addition to use in transgender women, <b>antiandrogens,</b> mainly GnRH analogues, are used as puberty blockers to prevent puberty in transgender girls until they are older and ready to begin HRT.|$|R
40|$|Androgen {{receptor}} (AR) plays {{a critical}} role in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). Current clinically used <b>antiandrogens</b> such as flutamide, bicalutamide, and newly approved enzalutamide mainly target the hormone binding pocket (HBP) of AR. However, over time, drug resistance invariably develops and switches these <b>antiandrogens</b> from antagonist to agonist of the AR. Accumulated evidence indicates that AR mutation is an important cause for the drug resistance. This review will give an overview of the mutation based resistance of the current clinically used <b>antiandrogens</b> and the rational drug design to overcome the resistance, provides a promising strategy {{for the development of the}} new generation of <b>antiandrogens</b> targeting HBP...|$|R
25|$|Antiandrogens {{that are}} {{currently}} on the market are particularly useful {{for the treatment of}} prostate cancer during the early stages. However, prostate cancer often progresses to a hormone-refractory state in which the cancer progresses in the presence of continued androgen ablation or <b>antiandrogen</b> therapy. This suggests that long term use of these antiandrogens during prostate cancer can lead to the development of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells or the ability of adrenal androgens to support tumor growth. This phenomenon is called <b>antiandrogen</b> withdrawal syndrome (AWS) {{and is one of the}} major drawbacks of existing antiandrogens. AWS is defined as tumor regression or symptomatic relief observed upon discontinuation of the <b>antiandrogen</b> therapy. The mechanism for this is not fully understood but current theories include alterations of the AR gene, coregulator proteins and/or signal transduction pathways. This <b>antiandrogen</b> resistance may also be linked to the relative weakness of current antiandrogens as they have an affinity 50 times or more lower than that of DHT for the AR. This may also explain why compensatory AR overexpression is often observed.|$|E
25|$|Flutamide, another {{frequently}} used <b>antiandrogen</b> which is nonsteroidal and a pure androgen blocker, though much less potent by weight and binding affinity than either spironolactone or cyproterone acetate, {{has been found}} to be more effective than either of them as an <b>antiandrogen</b> when it is used at the typical treatment doses. Unfortunately, the uses of both cyproterone acetate and flutamide have been associated with hepatotoxicity, which can be severe with flutamide and has resulted in cyproterone acetate never being approved in the United States. Bicalutamide is a more potent, safer, and more tolerable alternative to flutamide, but is relatively little-studied in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions aside from prostate cancer, though it has been used to treat hirsutism with success. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues are another very effective option for <b>antiandrogen</b> therapy, but have not been widely employed for this purpose due to their high cost and limited insurance coverage despite many now being available as generics. As such, spironolactone may be the only practical, safe, available, and well-supported <b>antiandrogen</b> option in some cases.|$|E
25|$|Due to its <b>antiandrogen</b> properties, {{spironolactone}} {{can cause}} effects associated with low androgen levels and hypogonadism in males. For this reason, men are typically not prescribed spironolactone for any {{longer than a}} short period of time, e.g., for an acute exacerbation of heart failure. A newer drug, eplerenone, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of heart failure, and lacks the <b>antiandrogen</b> effects of spironolactone. As such, it is far more suitable for men for whom long-term medication is being chosen. However, eplerenone may not be as effective as spironolactone or the related drug canrenone in reducing mortality from heart failure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antiandrogens,</b> {{including}} spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide, bicalutamide, and finasteride, {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} or eliminate unwanted body hair, such as in the treatment of hirsutism. Although effective for reducing body hair, <b>antiandrogens</b> have little effect on facial hair. However, slight effectiveness may be observed, such as some reduction in density/coverage and slower growth. <b>Antiandrogens</b> will also prevent further development of facial hair, despite only minimally affecting that which is already there. With the exception of 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride, <b>antiandrogens</b> are contraindicated in men due to the risk of feminizing side effects such as gynecomastia as well as other adverse reactions (e.g., infertility), and are generally only used in women for cosmetic/hair-reduction purposes.|$|R
50|$|Androgens {{increase}} sex drive, and {{for this}} reason, <b>antiandrogens</b> are able to reduce sex drive in men. In accordance, <b>antiandrogens</b> {{are used in the}} treatment of hypersexuality (excessively high sex drive) and paraphilias (atypical and sometimes societally unacceptable sexual interests) like pedophilia (sexual attraction to children). They have been used to decrease sex drive in sex offenders so as to reduce the likelihood of recidivism (repeat offenses). <b>Antiandrogens</b> used for these indications include cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and GnRH analogues.|$|R
25|$|<b>Antiandrogens</b> affect {{existing}} {{facial hair}} only slightly; patients may see slower growth and some reduction in density and coverage. Those {{who are less}} than a decade past puberty and/or whose race generally lacks a significant amount of facial hair may have better results. Patients taking <b>antiandrogens</b> tend to have better results with electrolysis and laser hair removal than those who are not. In patients in their teens or early twenties, <b>antiandrogens</b> prevent new facial hair from developing if testosterone levels are within the normal female range.|$|R
25|$|Thalidomide also binds to {{and acts}} as an {{antagonist}} of the androgen receptor (AR) and hence is a nonsteroidal <b>antiandrogen</b> (NSAA) of some capacity. In accordance, it can produce gynecomastia and sexual dysfunction as side effects in men.|$|E
25|$|There are few {{available}} {{options for}} <b>antiandrogen</b> therapy. Spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, and flutamide {{are some of}} the most well-known and widely used drugs. Compared to cyproterone acetate, spironolactone is considerably less potent as an <b>antiandrogen</b> by weight and binding affinity. However, despite this, at the doses of which they are typically used, spironolactone and cyproterone acetate have been found to be generally about equivalent in terms of effectiveness for a variety of androgen-related conditions, though, cyproterone acetate has shown a slight though non-statistically-significant advantage in some studies. Also, it has been suggested that cyproterone acetate could be more effective in cases where androgen levels are more pronounced, though this has not been proven.|$|E
25|$|Canrenone is an {{antagonist}} of the MR {{similarly to}} spironolactone, but is slightly more potent in comparison. In addition, canrenone inhibits steroidogenic enzymes such as 11β-hydroxylase, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 17α-hydroxylase, and 21-hydroxylase similarly to spironolactone, {{but once again}} is more potent in doing so in comparison. In vitro, canrenone binds to and blocks the AR. However, relative to spironolactone, canrenone is described as having very weak affinity to the AR. In accordance, replacement of spironolactone with canrenone in male patients {{has been found to}} reverse spironolactone-induced gynecomastia, suggesting that canrenone is comparatively much less potent in vivo as an <b>antiandrogen.</b> As such, based on the above, the <b>antiandrogen</b> effects of spironolactone are considered to be largely due to other metabolites rather than due to canrenone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Antiandrogens</b> {{are used}} in the {{treatment}} of an assortment of androgen-dependent conditions in both men and women. They are used to treat men with prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, androgenic alopecia, hypersexuality, and paraphilias, as well as boys with precocious puberty. They have also been used to treat men with priapism. In women, <b>antiandrogens</b> are used to treat acne, seborrhea, hidradenitis suppurativa, hirsutism, and hyperandrogenism. <b>Antiandrogens</b> are also used in transgender women as a component of HRT and as puberty blockers in transgender youth.|$|R

25|$|Spironolactone is not {{generally}} used in {{men for the}} treatment of androgen-dependent dermatological conditions because of its feminizing side effects, but it is effective for such indications in men similarly. This is evidenced by the usefulness of spironolactone as an <b>antiandrogen</b> in transgender women.|$|E
25|$|It is a steroidal antiprogestogen (IC50 = 0.025 nM for the PR), {{as well as}} an antiglucocorticoid (IC50 = 2.2 nM for the GR) and <b>antiandrogen</b> (IC50 = 10 nM for the AR) to a much lesser extent. It antagonizes {{cortisol}} action competitively at the receptor level.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used antiandrogens for transgender women are steroidal: spironolactone and cyproterone acetate. Spironolactone, which is relatively safe and inexpensive, is {{the most frequently used}} <b>antiandrogen</b> in the United States.

50|$|In {{addition}} to their progestogenic activity, some progestins are antagonists of the androgen receptor {{and can be used}} therapeutically as <b>antiandrogens.</b> These progestins, with varying degrees of potency as <b>antiandrogens,</b> include chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, dienogest, drospirenone, medrogestone, megestrol acetate, nomegestrol acetate, osaterone acetate (veterinary), and oxendolone.|$|R

25|$|Valproic acid {{has been}} found to be an {{antagonist}} of the androgen and progesterone receptors, and hence as a nonsteroidal <b>antiandrogen</b> and antiprogestogen, at concentrations much lower than therapeutic serum levels. In addition, the drug has been identified as a potent aromatase inhibitor, and suppresses estrogen concentrations. These actions are likely to be involved in the reproductive endocrine disturbances seen with valproic acid treatment.|$|E
25|$|Cyproterone acetate is a {{powerful}} <b>antiandrogen</b> and progestin that suppresses gonadotropin levels (which in turn reduces androgen levels), blocks androgens from binding to and activating the androgen receptor, and inhibits enzymes in the androgen biosynthesis pathway.

25|$|Because of the <b>antiandrogen</b> {{activity}} of spironolactone, {{it can be}} quite effective in treating acne in women, and also reduces oil that is naturally produced in the skin. Though not the primary intended purpose of the medication, the ability of spironolactone to be helpful with problematic skin and acne conditions was discovered {{to be one of}} the beneficial side effects and has been quite successful. Oftentimes, for women treating acne, spironolactone is prescribed and paired with a birth control pill. Positive results in the pairing of these two medications have been observed, although these results may not be seen for up to three months. Spironolactone is commonly used in the treatment of hirsutism in women, and is considered to be a first-line <b>antiandrogen</b> for this indication. Spironolactone can be used in the treatment of female pattern hair loss (FPHL). There is tentative low quality evidence supporting its use for this indication. Although apparently effective, it should be noted that not all cases of FHPL are dependent on androgens.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone is {{a potent}} and direct {{antagonist}} of the AR, blocking androgens like testosterone from binding to and activating the receptor. The AR antagonism of spironolactone mostly underlies its <b>antiandrogen</b> activity and is responsible for its therapeutic benefits {{in the treatment of}} androgen-dependent conditions like acne, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss and its usefulness in hormone therapy for transgender women. In addition, the AR antagonism of spironolactone is involved in its feminizing side effects like gynecomastia in men.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine {{has been}} found to possess {{clinically}} significant albeit weak <b>antiandrogen</b> activity at high doses. It {{has been found}} to directly and competitively displace testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and antagonize the androgen receptor (AR) in animals. In addition, cimetidine {{has been found to}} inhibit 2-hydroxylation of estradiol (via inhibition of CYP450 enzymes, which are involved in the metabolic inactivation of estradiol), resulting in increased levels of estrogen. By increasing estrogen levels, cimetidine can also decrease testosterone and increase prolactin levels.|$|E

In addition, <b>antiandrogens</b> can cause infertility, osteoporosis, hot flashes, sexual dysfunction (including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction), depression, fatigue, anemia, and decreased semen/ejaculate volume in males. Conversely, {{the side effects of}} selective AR antagonists in women are minimal. However, antigonadotropic <b>antiandrogens</b> like cyproterone acetate can produce hypoestrogenism, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis in premenopausal women, among other side effects.|$|R
