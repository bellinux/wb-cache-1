5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin {{had been unable to}} explain what happened at a Home seance, and critics claimed that Home had refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin. There is, however, not <b>a</b> <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> evidence for either of these claims.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock Hoax is {{a detective}} who has little respect {{in the small}} {{tropical}} town where he lives, {{despite the fact that}} he thinks he is a better sleuth than Sherlock Holmes. A pair of boys decide to play a trick on Hoax and tell him about a murder. Hoax rushes to scene of the crime where he discovers <b>a</b> <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> cloth, later finding that a tramp is wearing the same type of clothes that he found. The tramp runs away and Hoax gives chase, with other people helping the pursuit. Eventually, Hoax captures the tramp with the aid of a police officer, and returns to the victim's body with the man. Hoax then comes to a realization that the body was just a dummy that had been stuffed with the leaves. The crowd has a laugh at Hoax's expense while the two boys are punished.|$|E

He asked Clwyd and Mahon to provide evidence or {{the names of the}} Iraqis who gave them the story.

25|$|Soon {{after leaving}} RADA Thaw made his formal stage début in <b>A</b> <b>Shred</b> <b>of</b> Evidence at the Liverpool Playhouse and {{was awarded a}} {{contract}} with the theatre. His first film role was a bit part in the 1962 adaptation of The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner starring Tom Courtenay and he also acted on-stage opposite Sir Laurence Olivier in Semi-Detached (1962) by David Turner. He appeared in several episodes of the BBC police series Z-Cars in 1963–64 as a detective constable. Between 1964 and 1966, he starred in two series of the ABC Weekend Television/ITV production Redcap, playing the hard-nosed military policeman Sergeant John Mann. He was also a guest star in an early episode of The Avengers. In 1967 he appeared in the Granada TV/ITV series, Inheritance, alongside James Bolam and Michael Goodliffe, as well as appearing in TV plays such as The Talking Head and episodes of series such as Budgie, where he played against type (opposite Adam Faith) as an effeminate failed playwright with a full beard and a Welsh accent.|$|E

Ringo Starr was the first to leave, as he said he could not stomach the food; McCartney {{departed}} in mid-March, while Harrison and Lennon were more interested in Indian religion and remained until April. According to the author Geoffrey Giuliano, Lennon left Rishikesh because he felt personally betrayed after hearing rumours that the Maharishi had behaved inappropriately towards women who accompanied the Beatles to India, though McCartney and Harrison later discovered this to be untrue and Lennon's wife Cynthia reported there was [...] "not <b>a</b> <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> evidence or justification".|$|E
500|$|The College Dropout {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 87, based on 25 reviews. Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times dubbed it [...] "2004's first great hip-hop album". The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin praised its [...] "substance, social commentary, righteous anger, ornery humanism, dark humor, and even Christianity", calling it [...] "one of those wonderful crossover albums {{that appeal to}} a huge audience without sacrificing <b>a</b> <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> integrity". Dave Heaton of PopMatters called the album [...] "musically engaging", writing that [...] "every single one of these songs comes off like a genuine extension of Kanye's personality and experiences". URB wrote that the album [...] "manages to be both visceral and emotive, sprinkling the dancefloors with tears and sweat." [...] Mojo dubbed the album [...] "manna for hip hop fans starved of basic but ballistic beats-and-breaks fare in an increasingly litigious age." ...|$|E

500|$|Later, {{the agents}} visit Boggs in prison, where he makes an impassioned revelation about the kidnapped couple {{based on a}} piece of [...] "evidence" [...] that is really <b>a</b> <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> Mulder's T-shirt. Satisfied that he is lying, the pair prepare to leave. Scully looks back at Boggs and sees another vision of her father, {{speaking}} to her and singing the song that had been played at his funeral, [...] "Beyond the Sea". She does not tell Mulder about this, and the pair discuss the possibility that Boggs has orchestrated the kidnapping with a partner to avoid execution. They have a fake newspaper made which declares the couple to have been found, hoping to trick Boggs into contacting his accomplice. He does not fall for the trick, but gives the agents vague clues about the case. Scully, acting on these, first finds a warehouse where the couple had been held, and later leads Mulder and several other agents to a boathouse where the kidnapper is holding the couple. The girl is rescued, but the kidnapper shoots Mulder and escapes with the boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|... "Listen" [...] scored {{generally}} positive {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. A reviewer from Pitchfork stated that [...] "when Beyoncé belts out the chorus, the inspiration is real, tangible, and contagious". Describing the song as a [...] "devastatingly beautiful ballad", Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine wrote, [...] "Beyoncé delivers {{the performance of}} her career, another defining moment in the brilliant flick [...]" [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone noted that the song [...] "adds grit and touching gravity to Deena". Another reviewer of the same publication called the song [...] "epic" [...] noting that Beyoncé [...] "unfurls the true range of her magnificent voice". Comparing the song to Andrew Lloyd Webber's [...] "piano weepie", a writer of The Observer stated that [...] "Listen" [...] is a [...] "bangers-to-ballads ratio to die for". Calling the song a [...] "showstopper", Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote: [...] " [...] is a big, soppy ballad that will move some to tears and irk others as a stunning example of art imitating life imitating art without <b>a</b> <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> irony." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that [...] "Listen" [...] will undoubtedly be [...] "the payoff for fans of Beyoncé's voice who sat through the first [...] minutes of [...] waiting for the cum shot." [...] By contrast, Jody Rosen's review for Entertainment Weekly was less impressed, describing [...] "Listen" [...] as [...] "gloopy" [...] and [...] "an inspirational ballad about 'the song in my heart', which builds to an enormous schlock-opera climax".|$|E

2500|$|Ehrenberg's {{early life}} {{is the subject of}} some discussion.

2500|$|In private rituals, {{which are}} often called [...] "magical", the myth and the ritual are {{particularly}} closely tied.

The Egyptologist David Frankfurter argues that these rituals adapt basic mythic traditions to fit the specific ritual, creating elaborate new stories (called historiolas) based on myth.

2500|$|Unfortunately, this {{reckless}} {{manner of}} dealing with evidence is typical of 1421, vitiating all its extraordinary claims: the voyages it describes never took place, Chinese information never reached Prince Henry and Columbus, {{and there is no}} evidence of the Ming fleets in newly discovered lands. The fundamental assumption of the book—that the Yongle Emperor dispatched the Ming fleets because he had a [...] "grand plan", a vision of charting the world and creating a maritime empire spanning the oceans—is simply asserted by Menzies without <b>a</b> <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> proof ... The reasoning of 1421 is inexorably circular, its evidence spurious, its research derisory, its borrowings unacknowledged, its citations slipshod, and its assertions preposterous ...

In contrast {{to much of the}} brand's history, Sacks, not Shredder, is the character connected to the Turtles' origins, having created them alongside April O'Neil's father; the Shredder (never referred to with any name other than his codename) has no connection to Splinter or the Turtles, and while he is shown to have scars on his face, it is not revealed how he suffered them.|$|R
