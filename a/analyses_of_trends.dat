40|$|Since {{laboratory}} {{determination of}} some nutrients {{was not possible}} in the past or is inaccurate compared to current determinations, nutritional information in old food composition tables is considered less reliable. It was therefore recommended to use the improved food composition table for the <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> <b>trends</b> within the Zutphen Study {{that are based on}} food composition studies for the 1960 - 1970 period. This report describes how an improved food composition table was created for the <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> <b>trends</b> in energy and nutrient intake. The products consumed most {{in the early years of}} the Zutphen Study were reviewed with respect to their protein, fat, saturated fatty acid, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid, eicosapentanoic acid, docosahexanoic acid, carbohydrates, dietary fibre and alcohol content. The method for creating time-specific food composition tables was used as a reference. This is the method employed by the Netherlands' NEVO foundation for food composition data. In general, the intake of the nutrients rose compared to the original nutrient intake, while the intake of mono-unsaturated fat, eicosapentanoic acid, dietary fibre and alcohol fell. Therefore, it is important to use the improved food composition table for the <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> <b>trends</b> in the Zutphen Study. Ranking the participants' nutrient intake in the Zutphen Study from low to high hardly changed. To conclude then, the use of the improved food composition table will not affect the study on relationships between diet and diseases in the Zutphen Study...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the “post-Fordist ” economy {{is alleged to have}} changed the structure of work careers in the American work force of the 1990 s. Most scholarly attention has focused on the implications of post-Fordism for job mobility or for the fraction of the workforce that has a “contingent ” employment relationship with the employer. But post-Fordism should also affect the relationship between job rewards and tenure with the employer, which sociologists have recognized as a core characteristic of the firm internal labor market. The theory of post-Fordism predicts a weaker relationship between tenure and job rewards and a correspondingly stronger relationship between general labor force experience and job rewards for the highly educated workers that arguably have become an even more dominant source of value creation in the post-Fordist economy. <b>Analyses</b> <b>of</b> <b>trend</b> data for male workers from the Current Population Surveys for the years 1983 – 1998 largely support these hypotheses. Additional analyses suggest that observed trends in the returns to job tenure and experience arise from real changes in the production of value rather than from selection mechanisms linked to post-Fordist-induced trends in th...|$|R
