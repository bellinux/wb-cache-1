40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{hypothesis}} that the higher rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) in Indians (South Asians) compared with Malays and Chinese is partly because of differences in antioxidants (vitamins A, C, and E, and selenium) and pro-oxidants (iron). DESIGN: Cross sectional study of the general population. SETTING: Singapore. PARTICIPANTS: Random sample of 941 persons aged 30 to 69 years. MAIN RESULTS: There were moderate correlations between vitamin A and vitamin E, and between these vitamins and selenium. Mean plasma vitamins A and E were similar by ethnic group. Vitamin A concentration for Indians were (men 0. 66 <b>and</b> <b>women</b> 0. 51 mg/l), Malays (men 0. 67 <b>and</b> <b>women</b> 0. 54 mg/l), and Chinese (men 0. 68 <b>and</b> <b>women</b> 0. 52 mg/l). Vitamin E concentrations for Indians were (men 12. 9 <b>and</b> <b>women</b> 12. 8 mg/l), Malays (men 13. 6 <b>and</b> <b>women</b> 13. 3 mg/l), and Chinese (men 12. 6 <b>and</b> <b>women</b> 12. 6 mg/l). In contrast, mean plasma vitamin C concentrations were lower in Indians (men 5. 7 <b>and</b> <b>women</b> 6. 9 mg/l) and Malays (men 5. 1 <b>and</b> <b>women</b> 6. 4 mg/l) than Chinese (men 6. 3 <b>and</b> <b>women</b> 8. 4 mg/l). Mean serum selenium was lower in Indians (men 117 <b>and</b> <b>women</b> 115 micrograms/l) than Malays (men 122 <b>and</b> <b>women</b> 122 micrograms/l) <b>and</b> Chinese (men 126 <b>and</b> <b>women</b> 119 micrograms/l). Mean serum ferritin was much lower in Indians (men 132 <b>and</b> <b>women</b> 50 micrograms/l) than Malays (men 175 <b>and</b> <b>women</b> 85 micrograms/l) <b>and</b> Chinese (men 236 <b>and</b> <b>women</b> 92 micrograms/l). MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Lower vitamin C and selenium in Indians, particularly in combination, could play a part in their increased risk of CHD. Vitamins A and E, and ferritin (iron) have no such role. Lower vitamin C in Indians and Malays is probably because of its destruction by more prolonged cooking. In Indians, lower selenium is probably because of a lower dietary intake and the much lower ferritin to a lower dietary intake of iron and its binding by phytates...|$|R
