Towards the end of the 16th century, Hieronymus Fabricius (1533–1619) described a useful technique for tracheotomy in his writings, although he had never actually performed the operation himself. Fabricius was the first to introduce the idea of a tracheostomy tube. In 1620 the French surgeon Nicholas Habicot (1550–1624) published a report of four successful tracheotomies.

40|$|In applied medicine, {{respiration}} {{is viewed}} as the chemical process of gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Corresponding experimental studies have enabled to observe the condition of all systems involved in respiration. In relaxation state, the cycles of inhalation and exhalation generally follow the temporal ratio 1 : 3 (1 : 1 for infants). The acceleration of breathing rate usually occurs {{on account of the}} shortening of exhalation cycle. The situation in which the exhalation phase is longer than the inhalation phase cannot be seen in normal circumstances. In the treatment of acute respiratory failure, this pattern of breathing is in rare cases used together with <b>artificial</b> pulmonary <b>respiration.</b> Hyperventilation always leads to hypocapnia of a healthy lung, since the exchange of carbon dioxide in alveolus occurs very rapidly by means of diffusion on the principle of redistribution of concentrations. From the viewpoint of medical practices, hypocapnia resulting from hyperventilation has a negative regulatory effect on humans. Scientists have explored the role of hyperventilation in various physiological psychoemotional conditions and activities. Various scientific theories and empirical studies link pathological anxiety and panic with hyperventilation. A patient may deliberately use hyperventilation to bring on clinical symptoms and in this case it is used as a diagnostic tool. At the same time, respiration training (including deliberate hyperventilation) is used for the same psychiatric disorders. In this study, the author's approach to hyperventilation is somewhat overgeneralised but is accurate in principle. The hypothesis posed by the author of the article, arguing that dancing (a motor activity), the technique of singing and/or breathing, the psychological disposition of participants of the ritual and the cultural context may evoke the state of trance, is a theory generally recognised also by other scholars...|$|R
40|$|An open {{incubation}} {{method has}} been used in many studies to directly estimate primary productivity and ecosystem functioning by measuring photosynthetic and respiratory rates in intertidal rockpool communities. The method measures changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations recorded in situ during an <b>artificial</b> dark period (<b>respiration)</b> and a natural light period (net primary productivity). Although this method has yielded interesting results, its advantages and limitations have yet to be thoroughly tested. The accuracy of the method was investigated in a controlled laboratory environment and compared with field incubations. Atmospheric oxygen diffusion across the air–water interface did not affect incubation measurements under low wind speed (< 2 m s? 1). Temperature increases during incubations were not greater than in natural rockpools and did not affect primary productivity. The major problem was the oxygen supersaturation which inhibited photosynthesis, thus leading to an underestimation of primary production. To allow comparable measurements, net primary productivity needs to be recorded during the linear phase of the photosynthetic process (< 30 min of light) before water reaches supersaturation (< 160 %). This method gives rapid and reliable estimates of primary productivity thereby allowing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning relationships to be tested using rockpools as natural mesocosms...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT – Context – Many {{patients}} in use of mechanical ventilation show clinical complications due to tracheal aspiration. Assessment and early methods are necessary, so that preventive and safety measures apply to this patients. Objective- To study {{the incidence of}} tracheal aspiration of saliva in tracheotomized patients treated {{in intensive care unit}} using two modes of mechanical ventilation and with different sedation levels. Method- Prospective study with 14 tracheotomized non-neurological patients using mechanical ventilation. The sample was divided into two groups based on ventilation mode: pressure support ventilation and pressure controlled ventilation. Those two groups were subdivided into two others according to sedation level. The speech pathology evaluation was completed via the blue dye test in order to analyze the incidence of tracheal aspiration of saliva. Results- Sedation levels and mechanical ventilation time related to tracheal aspiration were not statistically significant in this study. On the other hand, ventilation mode and tracheal aspiration showed statistical significance, and there was a higher incidence of tracheal aspiration in the pressure controlled ventilation mode. Conclusion- It was possible to observe a significant relationship between tracheal aspiration incidence and pressure controlled ventilation mode, which means the inclusion of those {{patients in}} the risk group for oropharyngeal dysphagia and their insertion in prevention protocols. The relationship between tracheal aspiration and sedation level, as well as tracheal aspiration and mechanical ventilation, were not statistically significant in this sample, needing further research.

Methods: A prospective, randomized and controlled study was performed involving 100 consecutive patients submitted to coronary artery bypass grafting or valve surgery. The subjects were admitted into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) under mechanical ventilation and randomized in a study group (n= 50), which used NPPV with bilevel pressure for 30 minutes after extubation, and a control group (n= 50) which only used a nasal O 2 catheter. Anthropometric variables and the times of the intra-operative periods corresponding to anesthesia, surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass, as well as the time required for weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation were analysed. The arterial blood gases and hemodynamic variables were also assessed before and after extubation. Results: The evolution was similar for the control and study groups without statistically significant differences of the variables analyzed except for the PaO 2. On comparing the groups, the PaO 2 improved significantly (p = 0. 0009) with the use of NPPV for 30 minutes after extubation, but there was no statistically significant difference in the PaCO 2 (p = 0. 557).

40|$|Background: Acute lung injury (ALI) is {{a serious}} {{clinical}} concern brought on by inflammatory triggers and is characterized by rapid onset of respiratory distress {{in the setting of}} inflammatory insult. Fibrin deposition from the inflammation leads to poor ventilation and perfusion. There is no current treatment for ALI other than supportive measures. Heparin is an anticoagulant that prevents fibrin deposition. Previous animal and ALI model studies have demonstrated improvement in lung function markers with nebulized heparin. This review looks at the effects of nebulized heparin in treating ALI in mechanically ventilated patients. Methods: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was performed using MedLine- OVID, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Keywords used included: mechanical ventilation/ <b>respiration,</b> <b>artificial</b> or acute lung injury, and nebulized heparin or nebulised heparin. Results: A total of 11 articles were reviewed for relevancy. Two articles were found including one randomized control study and one prospective observational study. While neither study found improvement in PaO 2 :FiO 2, one study found significant improvement in ventilator free days. The overall quality of the studies was very low and further studies with large, randomized control trials will need to be completed. Conclusion: There isn’t enough data available yet on nebulized heparin to recommend routine use as adjunctive treatment for ALI. Standard lung function markers like PaO 2 :FiO 2 {{may not be the most}} useful marker for nebulized heparin trials. Larger, longer randomized control trials need to be completed for further study using patient important outcomes such as ventilator free days...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Jet nebulizers {{constitute}} the aerosolization devices {{most frequently used}} during mechanical ventilation. Continuous nebulization can influence the delivered tidal volume (VT) and lead to significant medication loss during expiration. Ventilators thus provide integrated jet neb-ulization systems that are synchronized during inspiration and ostensibly keep VT constant. METHODS: This was a bench study of systems integrated in the Evita XL, Avea, Galileo, and G 5 ventilators. The VT delivered with and without nebulization, the inspiratory synchronization of nebulization, and the aerosol deposition were measured with 2 locations of the nebulizer. RESULTS: Changes in VT with the nebulizer were below 20 mL and below 10 % of set VT for all ventilators. Synchronization was good {{at the beginning of}} insufflation, but prolonged nebulization was observed with all ventilators at the end of insufflation, until up to 1 s during expiration: 5 – 80 % of nebuli-zation occurred during expiration with significant aerosol loss in the expiratory limb. Synchrony could be improved by (1) reducing gas compression/decompression phenomena proximal to the jet nebulizer and (2) increasing inspiratory time, which reduced the amount of nebulization occurring during expiration. Placing the nebulizer upstream in the inspiratory limb did not affect inspiratory synchrony but allowed reduction of the amount of aerosol lost in the expiratory limb. CONCLUSIONS: Jet nebulizer systems integrated in the tested ventilators are reliable in terms of VT control. Gas compression in tubing driving gas to the nebulizer delays synchronization and reduces nebulization yield if the nebulizer is placed close to the Y-piece. Increasing inspiratory time with no end-inspiratory pause reduces the expiratory loss of medication if placement of the nebu-lizer upstream in the inspiratory limb is not feasible.

Novelda's Ultra Wide Band radar {{is able to}} detect respiration of humans and animals by measuring distance to the chest wall. This results in a characteristic Doppler-spectrum. One challenge is oscillating objects e. g. fans and ceiling lamps, which also give a similar Doppler-spectrum, but for many use-cases should not be treated i. e. classified as human <b>respiration.</b> <b>Artificial</b> Neural Networks (ANN) {{is a form of}} Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is an interesting and modern way of solving such classification problems that also seems suitable for this case, where training data is abundant. This thesis studies the use of Artificial Neural Networks to achieve the highest possible sensitivity and specificity for this classification problem. Throughout the project, a variety of artificial neural networks was tested using Matlab's "Neural Networks Toolbox". The training data was recorded by the author and Novelda employees using Novelda's XeThru UWB radar. The results show that by preprocessing the radar signals into time-vs-frequency images of signal energy, and then use a convolutional neural network as classifier, human respiration can be distinguished from other oscillating objects with a high sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity and specificity achieved on the test data used for this study was respectively 99. 1 % and 99. 8 %, although these results will probably vary with the use of different test data. The filters of the convolutional layers of the CNNs and recordings that was reverse engineered from a trained CNN was also studied. These studies revealed that the CNN was actually looking for the variations in frequency found in natural human respiration but not in oscillating objects. Also, it only seemed to look for very local patterns, which may be a result of the relatively shallow architectures used here compared to the CNNs used for e. g. face recognition. Thoughts on future work are also discussed in this report. This includes discussions of why deeper CNNs could be suited for this problem, smarter use of some of the tested concepts like e. g. artificial expansion of training data, and the use of ANNs for discovering patterns for use in other types of classifiers...|$|R
25|$|A {{continued}} lack {{of oxygen}} in the brain, hypoxia, will quickly render a person unconscious usually around a blood partial pressure of oxygen of 25–30 mmHg. An unconscious person rescued with an airway still sealed from laryngospasm stands {{a good chance of}} a full recovery. <b>Artificial</b> <b>respiration</b> is also much more effective without water in the lungs.

The lack of water found in lungs during autopsy does not necessarily mean there was no water at the time of drowning, as small amounts of freshwater are readily absorbed into the bloodstream. Hypercarbia and hypoxia both contribute to laryngeal relaxation, after which the airway is effectively open through the trachea. There is also bronchospasm and mucous production in the bronchi associated with laryngospasm, and these may prevent water entry at terminal relaxation.|$|E

We examined whether previous hospitalizations were independently associated with mortality among patients with COPD ventilated {{for the first time}}. Patients and methods: In the Danish National Patient Registry, we established a cohort of patients with COPD ventilated for the first time from 2003 to 2011 and previously medicated for obstructive airway diseases. We assessed the number of hospitalizations for COPD in the preceding year, age, sex, comorbidity, mode of ventilation, survival to discharge, and days to death beyond discharge. Results: The cohort consisted of 6, 656 patients of whom 66 % had not been hospitalized for COPD in the previous year, 18 % once, 8 % twice, and 9 % thrice or more. In-hospital mortality was 45 %, and of the patients alive at discharge, 11 % died within a month and 39 % within a year. In multivariate models, adjusted for age, sex, mode of ventilation, and comorbidity, odds ratios for in-hospital death were 1. 26 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 11 – 1. 44), 1. 43 (95 % CI:  1. 19 – 1. 72), and 1. 56 (95 % CI: 1. 30 – 1. 87) with one, two, and three or more hospitalizations, respectively.

On February 8, 2016, {{at the age of}} two, Abigail received a kidney from her father at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford in California.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1820s, Thornton {{wrote of}} having been summoned to Mount Vernon in December 1799, {{in the hopes that}} {{he would be able to}} treat George Washington, but of having arrived after Washington's death; as a result, he devised a plan to resurrect Washington's frozen corpse by [...] (f)irst to thaw him in cold water, then to lay him in blankets, & by degrees & by {{friction}} to give him warmth, and to put into activity the minute blood vessels, at the same time to open a passage to the Lungs by the Trachaea, and to inflate them with air, to produce an <b>artificial</b> <b>respiration,</b> and to transfuse blood into him from a lamb. Thornton's plan was rejected, however, despite [...] "there (being) no doubt in (Thornton's) mind that (Washington's) restoration was possible." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1960 {{the three}} {{investigators}} reported their findings on 20 cases of in-hospital cardiac arrest in JAMA. Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) survived and were {{discharged from the}} hospital. Many of the patients were in cardiac arrest {{as a result of}} anaesthesia. Three patients were documented to be in ventricular fibrillation. The duration of chest compression varied from less than 1minute to 65minutes. The JAMA article was very straightforward: chest compression buys time until the external defibrillator arrives on the scene. As the authors write in the article, [...] "Anyone, anywhere, can now initiate cardiac resuscitative procedures. All that is needed is two hands". However, respiration received relatively little attention in the 1960 JAMA article. Many of the patients had been intubated and thus the need for mouth-to-mouth ventilation was not necessary. It was not long however, before this newly discovered technique was used in conjunction with the longer held techniques of <b>artificial</b> <b>respiration.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The 'ABC' {{method of}} remembering the correct {{protocol}} for CPR {{is almost as}} old as the procedure itself, and {{is an important part of}} the history of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Throughout history, a variety of differing methods of resuscitation had been attempted and documented, although most yielded very poor outcomes. In 1957, Peter Safar wrote the book ABC of Resuscitation, which established the basis for mass training of CPR. [...] This new concept was distributed in a 1962 training video called [...] "The Pulse of Life" [...] created by James Jude, Guy Knickerbocker and Peter Safar. [...] Jude and Knickerbocker, along with William Kouwenhouen developed the method of external chest compressions, while Safar worked with James Elam to prove the effectiveness of <b>artificial</b> <b>respiration.</b> [...] Their combined findings were presented at annual Maryland Medical Society meeting on September 16, 1960, in Ocean City, and gained rapid and widespread acceptance over the following decade, helped by the video and speaking tour the men undertook. The ABC system for CPR training was later adopted by the American Heart Association, which promulgated standards for CPR in 1973.|$|E
2500|$|Parathion is a cholinesterase inhibitor. It {{generally}} {{disrupts the}} nervous system by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. It is absorbed via skin, mucous membranes, and orally. Absorbed parathion is rapidly metabolized to paraoxon, as described in Insecticidal activity. Paraoxon exposure can result in headaches, convulsions, poor vision, vomiting, abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, unconsciousness, tremor, dyspnea, and finally lung-edema as well as respiratory arrest. [...] Symptoms of poisoning are known to last for extended periods, sometimes months. The most common and very specific antidote is atropine, in doses of up to 100mg daily. Because atropine may also be toxic, {{it is recommended that}} small frequently repeated doses be used in treatment. If human poisoning is detected early and the treatment is prompt (atropine and <b>artificial</b> <b>respiration),</b> fatalities are infrequent. Insufficient oxygen will lead to cerebral hypoxia and permanent brain damage. [...] Peripheral neuropathy including paralysis is noticed as late sequelae after recovery from acute intoxication. Parathion and related organophosphorus pesticides are used in hundreds of thousands of poisonings annually, especially suicides. It is known as [...] "Schwiegermuttergift" [...] (mother-in-law poison) in Germany. For this reason, most formulations contain a blue dye providing warning.|$|E
