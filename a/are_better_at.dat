5|$|The {{ability of}} birds to {{navigate}} during migrations cannot be fully explained by endogenous programming, {{even with the}} help of responses to environmental cues. The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps. Satellite tracking of day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> making corrections for wind drift.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle {{has one of}} {{the best}} {{developed}} senses of smell of any dog. In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute, while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at all. Beagles <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most mountain rescue teams in favor of collies, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable. The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.|$|E
25|$|Infants {{are able}} to extract {{meaningful}} distinctions in the language {{they are exposed to}} from statistical properties of that language. For example, if English-learning infants are exposed to a prevoiced /d/ to voiceless unaspirated /t/ continuum (similar to the /d/ - /t/ distinction in Spanish) with the majority of the tokens occurring near the endpoints of the continuum, i.e., showing extreme prevoicing versus long voice onset times (bimodal distribution) they <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> discriminating these sounds than infants who are exposed primarily to tokens {{from the center of the}} continuum (unimodal distribution).|$|E

25|$|Relationship {{quality is}} {{positively}} associated with partners' level of conscientiousness, and highly conscientious people {{are less likely to}} get divorced. Conscientiousness is associated with lower rates of behavior associated with divorce, such as extramarital affairs, spousal abuse, and alcohol abuse. Conscientious behaviors may have a direct influence on relationship quality, as people low in conscientiousness are less responsible, less responsive to their partners, are more condescending, and less likely to hold back offensive comments. On the other hand, more conscientious people <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> managing conflict and tend to provoke fewer disagreements, perhaps because they elicit less criticism due to their well-controlled and responsible behavior.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, cone {{cells are}} less {{sensitive}} to the overall intensity of light, but come in three varieties that are sensitive to different frequency-ranges and thus {{are used in the}} perception of colour and photopic vision. Cone cells are highly concentrated in the fovea and have a high visual acuity meaning that they <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> spatial resolution than rod cells. Since cone cells are not as sensitive to dim light as rod cells, most night vision is limited to rod cells. Likewise, since cone cells are in the fovea, central vision (including the vision needed to do most reading, fine detail work such as sewing, or careful examination of objects) is done by cone cells.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} {{psychologist}} J. Philippe Rushton found creativity to correlate with intelligence and psychoticism. Another study found creativity {{to be greater}} in schizotypal than in either normal or schizophrenic individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the prefrontal cortex, schizotypal individuals {{were found to have}} much greater activation of their right prefrontal cortex. This study hypothesizes that such individuals <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, ambidexterity is also associated with schizotypal and schizophrenic individuals. Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal and hypomanic personality and several different measures of creativity.|$|E

25|$|The {{third part}} {{concerns}} predictiveness, covering events at three different scales: great {{events such as}} plagues, famines, floods and wars; weather, winds and storms; and medicine, with influences on the humours, the four Aristotelian fluids of the body. Oresme criticizes all of these as misdirected, though he accepts that prediction is a legitimate area of study, and argues that {{the effect on the}} weather is less well known than the effect on great events. He observes that sailors and farmers <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> predicting weather than astrologers, and specifically attacks the astrological basis of prediction, noting correctly that the zodiac has moved relative to the fixed stars (because of precession of the equinoxes) since the zodiac was first described in ancient times.|$|E
25|$|The McGurk {{effect is}} a perceptual {{phenomenon}} that demonstrates an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. The illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound. The visual information a person gets from seeing a person speak changes the way they hear the sound. If a person is getting poor quality auditory information but good quality visual information, {{they may be more}} likely to experience the McGurk effect. Integration abilities for audio and visual information may also influence whether a person will experience the effect. People who <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> sensory integration have been shown to be more susceptible to the effect. Many people are affected differently by the McGurk effect based on many factors, including brain damage and other disorders.|$|E
25|$|Traditional phonics {{instruction}} has marked benefits. Early reading {{often involves}} significant expansion of a child's mental lexicon, which includes {{all the words}} the child has been exposed to and their meanings. By focusing {{on the principle of}} linking specific sounds and characters, the child has the ability to recognize new words and derive meaning from them. Being able to adapt what they know about language to new words they experience is crucial to expanding their mental lexicon; this allows for productive reading that is the ability to read new words. It also produces higher achievement for beginning readers and the difference is the greatest for those at risk of failing to learn to read. While some children are able to infer these rules on their own, some need explicit instructions on phonics rules. Overall, children who are directly taught phonics <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> reading, spelling and comprehension.|$|E

25|$|Rabbits live in warrens {{that contain}} two to 10 other {{individuals}} living in smaller groups to ensure greater breeding success. Territoriality and aggression contribute greatly to the rabbits maturation process and help ensure survival of the population. Mature male and females <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> fighting off predators. Females {{tend to be more}} territorial than males, although the areas most frequented by females are not defended. Rabbits mark their territories with dung hills. They expel soft, mucus-covered pellets that are sometimes reingested (coprophagy). They also expel larger pellets covered with secretions from the anal gland. A rabbit’s success in repelling strangers depends on the potency of the pellets. When young rabbits leave their natal warrens, they either settle in their pre-existing territories, take over unoccupied, formerly established territories, or become transients. Females tend to move into neighboring territories, while males tend to move further away.|$|E
500|$|The female's {{preference}} for the male mate has also been examined, in accordance to the male's size and fighting ability. The female cichlid always chooses {{the larger of the}} two males if the smaller male is next to the larger male, and if the larger male defeats the smaller male in a fight. If the males are not viewed together at the same time for a comparison to be drawn by the female, the female has no particular preference. Females do benefit by mating with a larger male, as {{it has been shown that}} larger males can raise more offspring to independence, <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> chasing predators that might attack offspring, and <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> competing for breeding sites. [...] Male size may act as a more effective indicator of aggression, which may thus repel intruders before they can come closer to the offspring. It has been shown that individuals of significantly greater size relative to their opponent often win fights without much physical contact. convict cichlid are one of easiest cichlid to breed and keep ...|$|E
500|$|Regardless of the {{specificity}} of the definition, researchers have generally agreed that cognitive flexibility is a component of executive functioning, higher-order cognition involving {{the ability to control}} one’s thinking. [...] Executive functioning includes other aspects of cognition, including inhibition, memory, emotional stability, planning, and organization. Cognitive flexibility is highly related with a number of these abilities, including inhibition, planning and working memory. Thus, when an individual is better able to suppress aspects of a stimulus to focus on more important aspects (i.e. inhibit color of object to focus on kind of object), they are also more cognitively flexible. In this sense, they <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> planning, organizing, and at employing particular memory strategies.|$|E

2500|$|Studies by Michael Conway et al., David Wagner and Joseph Berger, John Williams and Deborah Best, and Susan Fiske et al. found {{widely shared}} {{cultural}} beliefs {{that men are}} more socially valued and more competent than women at most things, as well as specific assumptions that men <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> some particular tasks (e.g., math, mechanical tasks) while women <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> others (e.g., nurturing tasks). Shelley Correll, Michael Lovaglia, Margaret Shih et al., and Claude Steele show that these gender status beliefs affect the assessments people make of their own competence at career-relevant tasks. Correll found that specific stereotypes (e.g., women have lower mathematical ability) affect women's and men's perceptions of their abilities (e.g., in math and science) such that men assess their own task ability higher than women performing at the same level. These [...] "biased self-assessments" [...] shape men and women's educational and career decisions.|$|E
