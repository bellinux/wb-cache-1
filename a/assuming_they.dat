This study explored the cognitive effects of MPH in students who either <b>assumed</b> <b>they</b> received MPH or <b>assumed</b> <b>they</b> received a placebo. Methods: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a between-subjects design, 21 students were subjected to partial sleep deprivation, receiving no more than 4 hours sleep the night before they were tested. In the morning, they were given either a placebo or 20 mg of MPH. They then performed free recall verbal tests and Go/No-Go tasks repeatedly, their moods were evaluated using Profile of Mood States and their tiredness was assessed using a visual analog scale, with evaluation of vigilance. Results: No {{significant differences were found}} between those subjects who received MPH and those who received a placebo. However, {{significant differences were found between}} subjects who <b>assumed</b> <b>they</b> had received MPH or had no opinion, and those who <b>assumed</b> <b>they</b> had received a placebo. At three minutes, one hour, and one day after memorizing ten lists of 20 words, those who <b>assumed</b> <b>they</b> had received MPH recalled 54 %, 58 %, and 54 % of the words, respectively, whereas those who <b>assumed</b> <b>they</b> had received placebo only recalled 35 %, 37 %, and 34 %. Conclusion: Healthy, partially sleep-deprived young students who <b>assume</b> <b>they</b> have received 20 mg of MPH experience a substantial placebo effect that improves consolidation of information into long-term memory. This is independent of any pharmacologic effects of MPH, which had no significant effects on verbal memory in this study. This information may be used to dissuade students from taking stimulants such as MPH during examination periods, thus avoiding subsequent abuse and addiction.

5|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, <b>assuming</b> <b>they</b> would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly {{in the middle of the}} sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used. Groening's original plan for Marge's hair was that it would conceal large, Life in Hell-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for The Simpsons.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers began in the mid-1980s when the Finnish National Board of Navigation launched a project to find secondary uses for the new vessels it was planning to build {{as a replacement for}} some of the oldest icebreakers. Until then the Finnish icebreakers had been designed solely for escort operations in ice-infested waters and their specialized hull form was not suitable for open water. As a result the existing icebreakers had an effective operational time of only three to five months per year and spent the summer season moored at Katajanokka in Helsinki. A multipurpose application of the new icebreakers would thus result in a better utilization of the vessels and, <b>assuming</b> <b>they</b> were chartered by a commercial third party during the summer, improve the economics of the state-owned fleet.|$|E
25|$|In May and June 2002 Roberto Soria and {{his colleagues}} at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics {{discovered}} two Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. ULXs are objects that emit tremendous amounts of X-rays (> 1032 watts or 1039 erg/s), <b>assuming</b> <b>they</b> radiate isotropically (the same in all directions). This amount is larger than currently understood stellar processes (including supernovae) but smaller than the amount of X-rays emitted by active galactic nuclei, which accounts for their alternate name, Intermediate-luminosity X-ray Objects (IXOs). The source designated ULX1 was found in a relatively empty interarm region, far from any bright clusters or star-forming complexes, and showed a 75% increase in X-ray luminosity over the course of 20 days. ULX2 was found in an exceptionally bright young stellar complex, and showed an order of magnitude increase over the same time period.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{this paper}} a {{specialist}} in general practice {{is referred to as}} a general practitioner (GP). In Finland only half of all GPs work as a health centre physician. The present aim was to establish what the working places of specializing and specialized physicians in general practice are, and where <b>they</b> <b>assume</b> <b>they</b> will work in the future. Methods The study population comprised 5, 357 physicians licensed in Finland during the years 1977 – 1996. Altogether 2, 956 questionnaires were returned, a response rate of 55. 2 %. Those either specializing (GP trainees, n= 133) or already having specialized (GPs, n= 426) in general practice were included in the study. Respondents were asked what kind of physician’s work they would most preferably do. They were further asked what work <b>they</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>they</b> would be doing in the year 2020. Results Altogether 72 % were working in public primary health centres and 14 % in the private sector. Of GPs 53 % and of GP trainees 70 % would most preferably work in health centres. Of GPs 14 % would most preferably work as private practitioners and 9 % as occupational health physicians. Sixteen per cent <b>assumed</b> <b>they</b> would be working as private practitioners and 35 % <b>assumed</b> <b>they</b> would be retired in the year 2020. Of GP trainees 57 % <b>assumed</b> <b>they</b> would be working as health centre physicians in 2020. Conclusions According to the present findings many experienced GPs will leave their work as a health centre physician. Moreover, several GP trainees do not consider health centre physician’s work as a long-term career option.

25|$|The {{absence of}} any ruling about matches played before 1947 (or before 1895 in Great Britain) has caused {{problems}} for cricket historians and especially statisticians. Important matches that meet the official definitions, <b>assuming</b> <b>they</b> featured teams of the necessary high standard, have been recorded since 1697 having been in vogue since the 1660s. It was inevitable that historians and statisticians would seek to apply unofficial first-class status retrospectively, in contravention of the ICC and MCC directives. The position is that each writer must compile his own list based on his personal opinions. As a result, significant differences may be observed in published statistical records with particular impact on the career records of W. G. Grace, Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe. There are differences in the perceived status of certain matches played by Gloucestershire teams before the county club was formed in 1870 and by Somerset in 1879 and 1881.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{students}} from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan live separately {{in their own}} dorms, as do foreigners. Mainlanders who are fluent in English or any foreign language may live in the foreigner- Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan dorms, <b>assuming</b> <b>they</b> will be a roommate {{and participate in the}} foreign student activities, in order to help people get accustomed to mainland Chinese life. The quality of these dorms is usually better than that of mainland student dorms, with rooms either shared between only two people or completely private for a single student. Sexual decency attitudes are laxer than in mainlander dorms, with males and females sharing the same buildings and sometimes hallways (though not rooms). Students are allowed to bring visitors—including mainlanders—of the opposite sex to their rooms. Guests {{may or may not be}} allowed to stay overnight, depending on the rules of the dorm. Electricity is usually available at all hours of the day.|$|E
