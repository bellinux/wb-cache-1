5|$|Hiroyuki Okiura, the {{character}} designer and key animation supervisor, designed a more mature <b>and</b> <b>serious</b> Motoko than Masamune Shirow's original portrayal of {{the character}} in the manga. Okiura chose to depict a physically mature person to match Motoko's mental age, instead of the youthful twenty-something appearance in the manga. Motoko's demeanor lacks the comedic facial expressions and rebellious nature depicted in the manga.|$|E
5|$|Numerous anime and manga {{publications}} have praised {{and criticized}} Kakashi's character. Although {{he has been}} noted to be an echo of similar detached shōnen manga characters, the duality of Kakashi's apathetic <b>and</b> <b>serious</b> sides have been praised. Kakashi has been highly popular with the Naruto reader base, placing high in several popularity polls. Merchandise based on Kakashi has also been released, including key chains and plush dolls.|$|E

5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} {{is generally}} considered the best method for airway management under {{a wide variety of}} circumstances, as it provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration. However, tracheal intubation requires a great deal of clinical experience to master <b>and</b> <b>serious</b> complications may result even when properly performed.|$|E
5|$|After the Roman Empire {{collapsed}} and the aqueduct fell into disuse, the Pont du Gard remained largely intact, {{due to the}} importance of its secondary function, as a toll bridge. For centuries the local lords and bishops were responsible for its upkeep, in exchange for the right to levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river, although some of its stones were looted <b>and</b> <b>serious</b> damage was inflicted on it in the 17th century. It attracted increasing attention starting in the 18th century, and became an important tourist destination.|$|E
5|$|At 10:29, Captain Aoki {{ordered the}} ship's {{magazines}} flooded. The forward magazines were promptly flooded, but the aft magazines were {{not due to}} valve damage, likely caused by the near miss aft. The ship's main water pump also {{appears to have been}} damaged, greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 damage control teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO2 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible to control, <b>and</b> <b>serious</b> fires began to advance deeper into the interior of the ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the near-miss aft made itself known when the ship's rudder jammed 30 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.|$|E

Visitors {{to the site}} wrote favourably of Capaldi's actions to record the video for the child. A few observed that Capaldi's version of the Doctor character is sinister <b>and</b> <b>serious,</b> and contrasted this with the actor's depiction of the character as warm and effusive in his recording.|$|E
5|$|By late October, the German {{forces were}} worn out, {{with only a}} third of their motor {{vehicles}} still functioning, infantry divisions at third- to half-strength, <b>and</b> <b>serious</b> logistics issues preventing the delivery of warm clothing and other winter equipment to the front. Even Hitler seemed to surrender {{to the idea of a}} long struggle, since the prospect of sending tanks into such a large city without heavy infantry support seemed risky after the costly capture of Warsaw in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Episodes {{typically}} {{depict the}} friends' comedic and romantic adventures and career issues, such as Joey auditioning for roles or Rachel seeking {{jobs in the}} fashion industry. The six characters each have many dates <b>and</b> <b>serious</b> relationships, such as Monica with Richard Burke and Ross with Emily Waltham. Ross and Rachel's intermittent relationship is the most often-recurring storyline; during the ten seasons of the show they repeatedly date and break up, even while Ross briefly marries Emily, he and Rachel have a child, Chandler and Monica date and marry each other, and Phoebe marries Mike Hannigan. Other frequently recurring characters include Ross and Monica's parents in Long Island, Ross's ex-wife and their son, Central Perk barista Gunther, Chandler's ex-girlfriend Janice, and Phoebe's twin sister Ursula.|$|E

5|$|Evidence is {{mounting}} {{that there is}} serious competition for food between larval/early juvenile introduced carp and larval/early juvenile native fish. Introduced carp dominate the fish faunas of lowland Murray-Darling rivers; the sheer amount of biomass carp now take up, and {{the large numbers of}} larvae carp produce, causes serious negative effects on river ecosystems and native fish. Carp are the main vector of the introduced Lernaea parasite (Lernaea cyprincea) <b>and</b> <b>serious</b> vectors of the introduced Asian fish tapeworm (Bothriocephalus acheilognathi).|$|E
5|$|Good {{conformation}} in {{the limbs}} leads to improved movement and decreased likelihood of injuries. Large differences in bone structure and size {{can be found}} in horses used for different activities, but correct conformation remains relatively similar across the spectrum. Structural defects, as well as other problems such as injuries and infections, can cause lameness, or movement at an abnormal gait. Injuries to and problems with horse legs can be relatively minor, such as stocking up, which causes swelling without lameness, or quite serious. Even non-fatal leg injuries can be fatal to horses, as their bodies are designed to bear weight on all four legs <b>and</b> <b>serious</b> problems can result if this is not possible.|$|E
5|$|Inside the church, an {{intricate}} five-tier icon screen funded by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky and executed by Hryhoryi Petriv from Chernigov {{was installed in}} 1718. During {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, almost all of the original Byzantine mosaics and frescoes on the interior walls were painted over. Some restoration work on the mosaics and frescoes that remained unpainted was carried out {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century. However, there were no major <b>and</b> <b>serious</b> investigations of the walls done, so it is possible that medieval frescoes or mosaics were preserved under the newer coats of plaster.|$|E

5|$|Kagan {{believes}} that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, {{he was no}} military genius, and his confidence and ambitions went far beyond his skills. He thus was capable of important errors <b>and</b> <b>serious</b> miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades committed a serious error in leaving the fleet {{in the hands of}} an inexperienced officer, and that most of the credit for the brilliant victory at Cyzicus must be assigned to Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, who said that the Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Operation Grange {{was led by}} Commander Simon Foy. Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Andy Redwood of Scotland Yard's Homicide <b>and</b> <b>Serious</b> Crime Command was {{the first}} senior {{investigating}} officer, reporting to Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell. The team consisted of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables, and around six civilian staff. When Redwood retired in 2014, he was replaced by DCI Nicola Wall. By July 2013 the review had become an investigation.|$|E
5|$|Shankar {{developed}} a style distinct {{from that of}} his contemporaries and incorporated influences from rhythm practices of Carnatic music. His performances begin with solo alap, jor, and jhala (introduction and performances with pulse and rapid pulse) influenced by the slow <b>and</b> <b>serious</b> dhrupad genre, followed by a section with tabla accompaniment featuring compositions associated with the prevalent khyal style. Shankar often closed his performances with a piece inspired by the light-classical thumri genre.|$|E

5|$|The Arrow was the {{culmination}} of a series of design studies begun in 1953 examining improved versions of the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck. After considerable study, the RCAF selected a dramatically more powerful design, <b>and</b> <b>serious</b> development began in March 1955. The aircraft was intended to be built directly from the production line, skipping the traditional hand-built prototype phase. The first Arrow Mk. I, RL-201, was rolled out to the public on 4 October 1957, the same day as the launch of Sputnik I.|$|E
5|$|The drug {{strontium}} ranelate aids bone growth, increases bone density, and {{lessen the}} incidence of vertebral, peripheral, and hip fractures. However, strontium ranelate also {{increases the risk of}} venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism <b>and</b> <b>serious</b> cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction. Its use is therefore now restricted. Its beneficial effects are also questionable, since the increased bone density is partially caused by the increased density of strontium over the calcium which it replaces. Strontium also bioaccumulates in the body.|$|E
5|$|The men {{arrived in}} Singapore on 18 February 1941 {{and moved into}} barracks at Port Dickson, {{in the north of}} Malaya. While there, the {{battalion}} undertook further training to prepare it for jungle warfare, before moving to Seremban in March. Further drafts of reinforcements arrived during this time as the battalion was brought up to its wartime establishment. The rigours of jungle training and the tropical heat affected the men, and a number of personnel were hospitalised during this time with illnesses such as malaria, measles, mumps <b>and</b> <b>serious</b> tropical skin diseases. Some of these were repatriated back to Australia, {{and by the end of}} March, the 2/18th was still below its authorised establishment, with an actual strength of 898.|$|E
