5|$|House {{prices in}} Weymouth and Portland are {{relatively}} high by UK standards, yet around {{average for the}} south of England—the average price of a detached house in 2010 was £303,622; semi-detached and terraced houses were cheaper, at £204,647 and £203,207 respectively, and an apartment or maisonette cost £155,056. The crime rate in Weymouth of 7.6 burglaries per 1000 households is {{lower than that of}} England and Wales (11.6 per 1000), but above that of Dorset (3.6 per 1000).

30|$|The {{method that}} we present {{in this study}} has been {{developed}} {{to aid in the}} analyticalstudy of solutions of networks like the reduced respiratory population model. To makethe presentation concrete, we present our results in terms of this model. Since twoof the four <b>active</b> <b>populations</b> relevant to the normal respiratory rhythm, those inthe pre-BötC, activate in near-synchrony, we will treat these as a singlepopulation and consider a three population network. The activity of one of the keyrespiratory brain stem populations depends on a persistent sodium current [10 – 13], while the other <b>active</b> <b>populations</b> feature an adaptation current instead [5, 6]. In the three population model that we use, we include this heterogeneityto illustrate that the theory handles heterogeneity easily, to distinguish one of thepopulations from the other two for ease of presentation of part of the theory, and tomaintain a strong connection with the respiratory application.|$|R

In the inner-city wards of Aston and Washwood Heath, the figure is higher than 30%. Two-fifths of Birmingham's population live in areas classified as in the 10% most deprived parts of England, and overall Birmingham is the most deprived local authority in England in terms of income and employment deprivation. The city's infant mortality rate is high, around 60% worse than the national average. Meanwhile, just 49% of women have jobs, compared to 65% nationally, and only 28% of the working-age population in Birmingham have degree level qualifications in contrast to the average of 34% across other Core Cities.|$|E

40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{number of}} microbial cells have been enumerated within subseafloor sediments, suggesting a biological impact on geochemical {{processes in the}} subseafloor habitat. However, the metabolically active fraction of these populations is largely uncharacterized. In this study, an RNA-based molecular approach {{was used to determine}} the diversity and community structure of metabolically <b>active</b> bacterial <b>populations</b> in the upper sedimentary formation of the Nankai Trough seismogenic zone. Samples used in this study were collected from the slope apron sediment overlying the accretionary prism at Site C 0004 during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 316. The sediments represented microbial habitats above, within, and below the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ), which was observed approximately 20 meters below the seafloor (mbsf). Small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) were extracted, quantified, amplified and sequenced using high-throughput 454 -pyrosequencing, indicating the occurrence of metabolically <b>active</b> bacterial <b>populations</b> to a depth of 57 mbsf. Transcript abundance and bacterial diversity decreased with increasing depth. The two communities below the SMTZ were similar at the phylum level, however only a 24 % overlap was observed at the genus level. Active bacterial community composition was not confined to geochemically predicted redox stratification despite the deepest sample being more than 50 meters below the oxic/anoxic interface. Genus-level classification suggested that the metabolically <b>active</b> subseafloor bacterial <b>populations</b> had similarities to previously cultured organisms. This allowed predictions of physiological potential, expanding understanding of the subseafloor microbial ecosystem. Unique community structures suggest very diverse <b>active</b> <b>populations</b> compared to previous DNA-based diversity estimates, providing more support for enhancing community characterizations using more advanced sequencing techniques...|$|R
