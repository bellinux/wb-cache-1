5|$|Corythosaurus is {{currently}} {{classified as a}} hadrosaurid, in the subfamily Lambeosaurinae. It is related to other hadrosaurs such as Hypacrosaurus, Lambeosaurus and Olorotitan, {{with the exception of}} Olorotitan they <b>all</b> <b>share</b> similar looking skulls and crests. However, research published in 2003 has suggested that even though it possesses a unique crest, Olorotitan is Corythosaurus closest known relative. Benson et al. (2012) found that Corythosaurus was closely related to Velafrons, Nipponosaurus, and Hypacrosaurus, and said that they formed a group of fan-crested lambeosaurines.|$|E

5|$|Ziphiids {{consist of}} 22 species of beaked whale. These vary from size, to coloration, to distribution, but they <b>all</b> <b>share</b> a similar hunting style.

5|$|Although {{there is}} great {{diversity}} in scale form, they <b>all</b> <b>share</b> a similar structure. Scales, like other macrochaetes, arise from special trichogenic (hair-producing) cells and have a socket which is enclosed in a special 'tormogen' cell; this arrangement provides a stalk or pedicel by which scales {{are attached to the}} substrate. Scales may be piliform (hairlike) or flattened. The body or 'blade' of a typical flattened scale consists of an upper and lower lamella with an air-space in between. The surface towards the body is smooth and known as the inferior lamella. The upper surface, or superior lamella, has transverse and longitudinal ridges and ribs. The lamellae are held apart by struts called trabaculae and contain pigments which give colour. The scales cling somewhat loosely to the wing and come off easily without harming the butterfly.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange <b>All</b> <b>Shares</b> Index (DSEI), Exchange rate (EX) and Market capitalisation (MC) using monthly data from July 2009 to December 2013 obtained from quarterly Updates and website of Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange. The regression and correlation techniques were used to establish the relationship. The dependent variable was the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange <b>All</b> <b>Shares</b> Index while Exchange rate and Market capitalisation, were independent variables of regression. The results show that the Exchange rate and the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange <b>All</b> <b>Shares</b> Index have positive regression coefficient, Market capitalisation and Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange <b>All</b> <b>Shares</b> Index also have positive regression coefficient. Also these three variables were found to have positive correlation coefficients. From these results obtained, we suggested that there is strong positive linear relationship between Market capitalisation and Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange <b>All</b> <b>Shares</b> Index, and moderate positive relationship between Exchange rate and the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange <b>All</b> <b>Shares</b> Index...|$|R

5|$|At {{the house}} of Will's friends Max and Bella, Anna fits in {{perfectly}} as they <b>all</b> <b>share</b> stories. Honey immediately recognizes Anna and declares them best friends instantly. She and Will share a private moment in a garden square as they walk back from the birthday party. The following evening {{they go to a}} restaurant, where Will overhears a group of patrons making crude remarks about Anna and attempts to defend her, before Anna steps in herself and humiliates them. As they walk back to her hotel, she invites Will up to her room. But when he arrives, she tells him he must leave immediately. Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears and starts to bark orders at him, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. Over the next six months, Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates, trying to help him move on; however Will, still hung up on Anna, does not connect with any of them.|$|E
5|$|The Q11, Q21, Q52, and Q53 <b>all</b> <b>share</b> a route along most of Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards, between Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst and Pitkin Avenue in Ozone Park. The Q11 and Q21 provide local service, {{while the}} Q52 and Q53 provide limited-stop service and extend into the Rockaways, an {{isolated}} peninsula in the south-west of Long Island which is popular {{as a summer}} retreat. The Q11 and Q21 originally corresponded to the northern (Woodhaven) and southern (Cross Bay) portions of the Boulevard respectively, while the Q53 originally made no stops along the corridor. The corridor parallels the former Rockaway Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, whose northern half remains inactive and whose southern half was reactivated for rapid transit service as the IND Rockaway Line of the New York City Subway. Service {{on the line to}} the Rockaways across Jamaica Bay was halted due to the 1950 fire on the Jamaica Bay trestle, and the LIRR sold the line to New York City due to its bankruptcy. The LIRR maintained service on the northern half of the line until 1962 while the NYCTA began operating subway service on the southern half in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Although they <b>all</b> <b>share</b> the forest, {{relationships}} between different Clans are tense. They often come {{into conflict with}} one another, becoming aggressive if a cat from a neighboring Clan accidentally crosses a border. This rivalry can increase in times of deprivation, such as if one Clan is suffering from a shortage of prey but another is thriving. An attempt for one Clan to steal all of or part of another Clan's territory is not unusual. To prepare for this, cats in all Clans are taught battle moves {{in order to protect}} their territory. Each Clan has signature battle moves that are taught to them from an early age (6 months/moons old). Border fights are the most common source of battle (a cat intentionally or unwittingly steps into another Clan's territory), and are often short-lived and cause no real damage to either side. However, bigger and more brutal battles can occur; at this point, casualties are to be expected. Despite this rivalry, the Clans can also show concern for another's well being; the idea of one Clan being destroyed causes deep distress, and will prompt urgent action on behalf of all four Clans. On the night of every full moon, the Clans will meet at a designated spot in order to share stories and news in peace. This is known as a 'Gathering', and is the only time in which fighting is prohibited.|$|E
