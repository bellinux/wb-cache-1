25|$|Trigonelline (N-methyl-nicotinate) is a {{derivative}} of vitamin B6 {{that is not}} as bitter as caffeine. In green coffee beans, the content is between 0.6% and 1.0%. At <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> temperature of , 85% of the trigonelline is degraded to nicotinic acid, leaving small amounts of the unchanged molecule in the roasted beans. In green coffee beans, trigonelline is synthesized from nicotinic acid (pyridinium-3-carboxylic acid) by methylation from methionine, a sulfur-containing amino acid. Mutagenic activity of trigonelline has been reported.|$|E
500|$|In July 1840 he {{attempted}} to fuse his desire to make money with his politics by founding a magazine called the Revue Parisienne, funded by his friend Armand Dutacq. Having already worked in the publishing industry, Balzac believed he had learned {{all there was to}} know about the trade. [...] "hat gigantic machine known as journalism", he wrote, [...] "is as simple as <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> spit turned by a poodle." [...] Balzac planned to publish his own fiction in the Revue Parisienne, in part to challenge the popularity of the roman-feuilleton serial format. Dutacq, however, stopped funding the project in September, after only three issues, and Balzac's final foray into the world of publishing came to an end.|$|E

60|$|Hugh made no answer, but {{throwing}} the bridle to his master, and snatching his wig from his head, {{in a manner}} so unceremonious and hasty that the action discomposed Mr Willet not a little, though performed at his own special desire, climbed nimbly to the very summit of the maypole before the house, and hanging the wig upon the weathercock, sent it twirling round like <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> jack.

60|$|At {{night we}} slept {{close to the}} {{junction}} of Ponsonby Sound with the Beagle Channel. A small family of Fuegians, who {{were living in the}} cove, were quiet and inoffensive, and soon joined our party round a blazing fire. We were well clothed, and though sitting close to the fire were far from too warm; yet these naked savages, though farther off, were observed, to our great surprise, to be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such <b>a</b> <b>roasting.</b> They seemed, however, very well pleased, and all joined in the chorus of the seamen's songs: but {{the manner in which they}} were invariably a little behindhand was quite ludicrous.|$|E
60|$|I {{had taken}} a third-class or deck-passage, whereby the evils of the journey were exasperated. <b>A</b> <b>roasting</b> sun pierced the canvas awning like hot water through a gauze veil, and by night the cold dews fell raw and thick as a Scotch mist. The cooking was abominable, and the dignity of Darwaysh-hood did not allow me to sit at meat with Infidels or to eat the food which they had polluted. So the Pilgrim squatted apart, smoking perpetually, with {{occasional}} interruptions to say his prayers and to tell his beads upon the mighty rosary; and he drank the muddy water of the canal out of a leathern bucket, and he munched his bread and garlic[FN#4] with a desperate sanctimoniousness.|$|E

60|$|To bound {{from the}} depths of despair to the pinnacles of hope is by no means an {{uncommon}} experience to vigorous youth. When Victor Ravenshaw awoke next morning after a profound and refreshing sleep, and looked up through the branches at the bright sky, despondency fled, and he felt ready for anything. He was early awake, but Peegwish had evidently been up long before him, for that wrinkled old savage had kindled the fire, and was seated {{on the other side of}} it wrapped in his blanket, smoking, and watching the preparation of breakfast. When Victor contemplated his solemn eyes glaring at <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> duck, which suggested the idea that he had been sitting there and glaring all night, he burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.|$|E
60|$|We put our pile of {{quicksilver}} balls into an iron retort {{that had}} a pipe leading from it to a pail of water, and then applied <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> heat. The quicksilver turned to vapor, escaped through the pipe into the pail, and the water turned it into good wholesome quicksilver again. Quicksilver is very costly, and they never waste it. On opening the retort, there was our week's work--a lump of pure white, frosty looking silver, {{twice as large as}} a man's head. Perhaps a fifth of the mass was gold, but the color of it did not show--would not have shown if two thirds of it had been gold. We melted it up and made a solid brick of it by pouring it into an iron brick-mould.|$|E

'In {{this season}} of time, so {{dangerous}} for the moral purity of the young man, his Mother again was his good Genius; a warning and request, in her soft tone of love sufficed to recall youthful levity within the barriers again, and restore the balance.

Whenever Schiller had decided to give himself a good day, he wandered out with some friend as far as Solit√ºde.' (Only some four or five miles.)
