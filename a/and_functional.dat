By working in the reals, with equality and without equality, we study properties of generalised computable operators <b>and</b> <b>functionals.</b> Also we propose an interesting application to formalisation of hybrid systems.

5|$|Bioinformatics is a {{field of}} study that {{includes}} the creation and advancement of databases, and computational and statistical techniques, {{that can be used}} in studies of the human brain, particularly in the areas of gene and protein expression. Bioinformatics and studies in genomics, <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> genomics, generated the need for DNA annotation, a transcriptome technology, identifying genes, and their and location and function. GeneCards is a major database.|$|E
5|$|Disease-modifying {{treatments}} only {{reduce the}} progression {{rate of the}} disease but do not stop it. As multiple sclerosis progresses, the symptoms tend to increase.

5|$|However, the {{nutritional}} {{significance of these}} components is defined not only by their structure or macronutrient category, {{but also by the}} physiological role that each nutrient serves. As a quantitatively minor presence within milk, MFGM likely contributes little to energy production, but its constituents may confer structural <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> benefits. Many of these nutrients are known to play important functional roles within the gut, brain, and elsewhere in the body; the functions of other components are still being elucidated.|$|E

5|$|René Descartes {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} dualism to tackle {{the issue of the}} brain's relation to the mind. He suggested that the pineal gland was where the mind interacted with the body after recording the brain mechanisms responsible for circulating cerebrospinal fluid. This dualism likely provided impetus for later anatomists to further explore the relationship between the anatomical <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> aspects of brain anatomy.|$|E

5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aziridines from imines {{is another important}} application of the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction and provides an alternative to amine transfer from oxaziridines.

The interactions of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements, or of signalling proteins and receptors, become locked in through multiple usages, making almost any mutation deleterious and hence eliminated by natural selection.|$|E
5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but {{several years before}} puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.|$|E
