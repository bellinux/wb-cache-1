5|$|Acid Tongue was {{released}} to generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics, receiving praise for Lewis' lyrics and vocals. However, some reviewers criticized the numerous collaborations <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> sound overwhelmed Lewis. The album charted at number twenty-two in the United States and number fifty-five in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's {{victory was}} the biggest in the Community Shield in 16 years. Wenger was pleased with his team's {{performance}} <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> win would provide a confidence boost for the coming season. Pellegrini's reaction was indifferent; he believed the absence of several first team players was linked to their poor show.|$|E
5|$|This result marked Manchester United's {{first defeat}} of 1999. It {{was the second}} {{consecutive}} year that Arsenal beat United to win the Charity Shield. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger described it as psychological boost to beat his opponents <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> win showed that his team were ready for the upcoming season. United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, on the other hand, believed the defeat highlighted his players needed more game time.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1992 Parry favoured a deal with ITV, but thought the network {{should be prepared to}} pay up towards £30 million for live football. At a meeting in January 1992, Dyke made it clear ITV would not be positioned as they were already paying too much for football. He and executive director Trevor East commented on BSkyB's debt <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> company would be forced to increase their borrowing if they were awarded a contract. This did not dissuade Quinton, who urged Murdoch to bid. Quinton even informed Chisholm that there were no bidding rules.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of the 2004–05 NHL season by the NHL lockout, Brashear signed with the Quebec Radio X of the semi-pro Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey league (LNAH). The deal was reportedly worth $300,000. He registered 18 goals and 50 points in 47 games, but was reluctant to fight <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> League did little {{to protect him from}} players wanting {{to make a name for}} themselves against an established NHL enforcer. Brashear was suspended from the League following an incident where he continued punching a player in the face while he was lying on the ice.|$|E

5|$|The show borrows {{elements}} and its design style from his Uncle Grandpa short, which was pitched {{to the network}} as a pilot. According to Browngardt, they were unsure about having a series centered on the title character, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> monster characters from the pilot had more potential. Character designer Robertryan Cory and David P. Smith (a director and storyboard artist on Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls) were brought on board to help shape the project's development.|$|E
5|$|As time passed, the {{releases}} of new CD-based consoles {{such as the}} 3DO Interactive Multiplayer rendered the Sega CD technically obsolete, reducing public interest in the add-on. In late 1993, {{less than a year}} after the system's launches in North America and Europe, the gaming media reported that Sega was no longer accepting in-house development proposals for the Mega-CD in Japan. In early 1995, Sega shifted its focus to the Sega Saturn and discontinued all advertising for Genesis hardware, including the Sega CD. Sega officially discontinued the add-on in the first quarter of 1996, saying that it needed to concentrate on fewer platforms <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> Sega CD could not compete in the current marketplace due to its high price tag and outdated single-speed drive. The last two games scheduled to be released for the Sega CD, Myst and Brain Dead 13, were subsequently cancelled. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold worldwide, including 400,000 in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Carey has {{expressed}} her belief in God and her connection between music and spirituality, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> album was finally {{a way to}} portray her mysticism into music. After the success of Carey's previous effort, Music Box, there was speculation of a new project in the works; however {{it was not until}} October 1994, only one month before the album's release, that Billboard announced Carey would be releasing a holiday album for the Christmas season. Initially, critics were shocked; they did not know how Carey would fare as an entertainer, as she had previously only been viewed as a pop star. Nevertheless, Carey, unaffected by the speculation, continued working on, and promoting the album in high spirits, confident in her work. The idea proved to be wise, earning Carey recognition in various markets including Christian radio and contemporary R stations, as well as extended her fame in Japan, where the album experienced much of its success.|$|E

5|$|Nights: Journey of Dreams {{was first}} conceptualised in November 2005 {{after the release}} of Sonic Team's Shadow the Hedgehog. Game design was {{primarily}} prepared by Takashi Iizuka and took around six months to reach the development process. Iizuka wanted to ensure that the next Nights game would stay faithful to the original, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> need to keep the game's concept fundamentally the same while incorporating a variety of new mechanics. Despite the cancellation of Air Nights, Iizuka stressed that he had always wanted to make a sequel and asserted that Sega's exit from hardware manufacturing had no effect on the delay. Iizuka felt that it was the appropriate time to release a Nights game—he felt that the industry was dominated by violence and was keen to release a more family-friendly title. The team realised that Nintendo's upcoming Wii was marketed as a family-orientated console, and factored in its online features and user-friendly design.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Nuremberg, Hess was {{reluctant}} {{to give up some}} of his possessions, including samples of food he said had been poisoned by the British; he proposed to use these for his defence during the trial. The commandant of the facility, Colonel Burton C. Andrus of the United States Army, advised him that he would be allowed no special treatment; the samples were sealed and confiscated. Hess's diaries indicate that he did not acknowledge the validity of the court <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> outcome was a foregone conclusion. He was thin when he arrived, weighing , and had a poor appetite, but was deemed to be in good health. As one defendant, Robert Ley, had managed to hang himself in his cell on 24 October, the remaining prisoners were monitored around the clock. Because of his previous suicide attempts, Hess was handcuffed to a guard whenever he was out of his cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} malapportionment {{had grown to}} a level in excess of 3:1 in favour of rural areas, and Hall, having won the 1968 state {{election}} on 46 per cent of the two-party-preferred vote, committed himself to a fairer electoral system. Previously 39 members were elected: 13 from metropolitan Adelaide and 26 from the country. Hall's first attempt for reform was a system with 45 seats and 20 from the country; this proposal received scorn from both Labor and the rural councillors, and was seen as not going far enough by the former and going too far by the latter. A second proposal, for 47 seats with 19 in the country, was adopted with bipartisan support in the House of Assembly, but encountered opposition in the Legislative Council. The new system would make an LCL win near-impossible at the coming 1970 state election, and Hall and the LCL were aware of it. For his weakening of rural constituencies, Hall became an enemy to those councillors who stood in defence of the previous system. Hall saw the political situation as untenable <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> LCL needed reform {{to cope with the}} removal of an artificial situation.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 2012 season {{which saw}} him score 733 County Championship runs and take 42 wickets, he was named Glamorgan's player of the year.

25|$|The land {{on which}} San Diego–Tijuana sits is due west of a major {{transform}} fault.

25|$|Porterfield {{was running}} a flying school at the Fairfax Airport outside Kansas City. He had been {{operating}} Jennies and Lincoln Standard biplane trainers, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> need for a more suitable and better-performing trainer aircraft. He consulted with several aeronautical engineers of the period, including Bellanca, and soon launched the production of several light single-engine two-seat high-wing and biplane aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Brigham Young {{personally}} reviewed {{all available}} {{information on the}} Salt Lake Valley and the Great Basin, consulting with mountain men and trappers who traveled through Winter Quarters, and meeting with Father Pierre-Jean De Smet, a Jesuit missionary familiar with the Great Basin. The wary Young insisted the Mormons should settle in a location no one else wanted, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> Salt Lake Valley met that requirement but would provide the Saints with many advantages as well.|$|E

In 1996 she co-founded the Afghan Women Association of Southern California, and she still hosts {{a radio talk show}} on the 24-hour Voice of Afghanistan. However, Zohra maintained a low profile about her former beauty queen status until 11 September 2001 when Daoud grew weary of the media's treatment of Afghan women as illiterate, burqa-clad victims, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> need to speak out.|$|E
