5|$|Bakaara Market {{was created}} in late 1972 by the Barre administration. It served as an open market {{for the sale of}} goods and services, {{including}} produce and clothing. After the start of the civil war, the market was controlled by various militant groups, who used it as a base for their operations. Following Mogadishu's pacification in 2011, renovations resumed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> Shops were rehabilitated, selling everything from fruit and garments to building materials. As {{in the rest of the}} city, Barkaara Market's real estate values have also risen considerably. , the local Tabaarak firm was renting out a newly constructed warehouse <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> for $2,000 per month.|$|E

5|$|Most historians thus concur that chattel {{slaves were}} indeed {{used in the}} Greek {{city-state}} of Sparta, at least after the Lacedemonian victory of 404 BC against Athens, but not in great numbers and only among the upper classes. As was in the other Greek cities, chattel slaves could be purchased <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> or taken in war.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of his junior year {{beginning}} in September 1928, Richard's parents permitted him to transfer to Whittier High School. At Whittier High, Nixon suffered his first electoral defeat, for student body president. He often rose at 4a.m., to drive the family truck into Los Angeles and purchase vegetables <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> He then drove to the store to wash and display them, before going to school. Harold had been diagnosed with tuberculosis the previous year; when their mother took him to Arizona in the hopes of improving his health, the demands on Richard increased, causing him to give up football. Nevertheless, Richard graduated from Whittier High third in his class of 207students.|$|E
5|$|In 1341, King Edward III visited Norwich for a jousting tournament, {{coinciding with}} the {{completion}} of the city's defensive walls. Edward and his mother, Isabella of France, were very impressed by the city and, as a token of appreciation for bearing the costs of the defensive fortifications, Edward granted the franchise of the market to the city in perpetuity. The control by the King's Clerk over trade <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> was ended and tolls and rents from the market from then on went directly to the city's bailiffs (the rulers of the city).|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England (1066–1071), Norwich was radically redesigned. Norwich Cathedral was built {{immediately}} {{to the east of}} Tombland and much of the old town to the southwest of Tombland was cleared for the motte of Norwich Castle. A new Norman town was built west of the Castle, in an area known as Mancroft. The new town at Mancroft included a market of its own to provide for the Norman settlers and merchants moving into the area, and possibly also to supply the castle's garrison. The exact date of the foundation of the market at Mancroft is not recorded, but it is known to have been operational by the time the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086. Granting the right to trade in Norman England {{was a part of the}} Royal Prerogative and, as with most fairs and markets of the period, the market at Mancroft was operated under licence from the King. The King's Clerk had jurisdiction over all trade conducted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> and tolls and rents were collected on behalf of the King.|$|E

5|$|Rightwise's {{new market}} cross only survived in its {{original}} form for a short time. During the English Reformation of the 1530s, the rood on the pinnacle was pulled down and the oratory became a storeroom. The octagonal plinth became a shopping arcade of small stalls. In 1549, a temporary gallows was erected at the cross for the mass execution of 60 {{of the participants in}} Kett's Rebellion, who had congregated in the marketplace during their brief capture of Norwich. In 1574, a local law was enacted demanding that all unemployed men were to assemble <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> cross each morning at 5.00am, along with the tools of their trade, and remain there for an hour in the hope that they would be offered work; a bonesetter was hired to treat any men who claimed they were unfit for work through injury. The success of this scheme is not recorded.|$|E
5|$|The reader {{progressively}} learns their history. Dobroselova originally {{lived in}} the country, but moved to St. Petersburg (which she hates) when her father lost his job. Her father becomes very violent and her mother severely depressed. Her father dies and they move in with Anna Fyodorovna, a landlady who was previously cruel to them but at least pretends to feel sympathy for their situation. Dobroselova is tutored by a poor student named Pokrovsky, whose drunken father occasionally visits. She eventually {{falls in love with}} Pokrovsky. She struggles to save a measly amount of money to purchase the complete works of Pushkin <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> for his birthday present, then allows his father to give the books to him instead, claiming that just knowing he received the books will be enough for her happiness. Pokrovsky falls ill soon after, and his dying wish is to see the sun and the world outside. Dobroselova obliges by opening the blinds to reveal grey clouds and dirty rain. In response Pokrovsky only shakes his head and then passes away. Dobroselova's mother dies shortly afterwards, and Dobroselova is left in the care of Anna for a time, but the abuse becomes too much and she goes to live with Fedora across the street.|$|E
25|$|Jump blues {{musician}} PK Dwyer {{is credited}} with forming the first-ever street band to busk <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Market.</b> He formed that band, Felix & the Freelicks, shortly after he arrived in the Pacific Northwest in 1971. The band evolved into various other alignments, including (successively) the Dynamic Logs, the Jitters, Throbbing Gems, the Royal Famille du Caniveaux / Gutter People of Paris, all of whom played <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Market.</b> Some of these alignments also included Ron Bailey; the Dynamic Logs included Orville Johnson as well. The band, Morrison Boomer, is a more recent staple and known to record live music <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E

500|$|Although {{habitat loss}} has been {{significant}} throughout {{the range of}} the slow lorises, their decline is most closely associated with unsustainable trade, either for exotic pets or for traditional medicine. Slow lorises are abundant <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>markets</b> and are among the most commonly sold primates. Slow lorises are easy to catch because they do not leap from tree to tree, often freezing and covering their face when spotted. (For this reason, Indonesians call them malu malu or [...] "shy one".) They are hunted not only by expert hunters, but are also easily caught by opportunist villagers because of the financial reward they bring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>markets.</b>|$|R
