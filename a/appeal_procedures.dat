50|$|The Hong Kong Securities and Investment Institute faces {{a lot of}} criticisms {{since the}} test were not checked or {{validated}} independently before implemented to the examinations. In addition to that, no formal <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> or practices are in place to check and balances the legitimacy of such examinations.

50|$|In Bosnia and Herzegovina some NGOs {{contribute}} {{to enforce the}} law on access to public information as well as to monitor its application and collect relevant data through the submission of FOI requests and the start of <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures.</b> This is the case, for instance, of the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN), Transparency International (Bosnia and Herzegovina), or the Sarajevo-based Center for Investigative Journalism (CIN).|$|E
50|$|Public {{complaints}} {{are made by}} phone, online, in writing, in person, via email or through the office. If it is decided that an investigation is warranted, investigators are assigned to review the matter and gather evidence. Complainants are advised to try and resolve their issue through the complaint and <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> offered by the government agency in question. Ombudsman staff assist people who are unsure whether an avenue of appeal exists.|$|E

50|$|According to this {{principle}} requests for public {{information should be}} processed quickly and fairly and an independent review of any refusals should {{be made available to}} the applicant. Also, public bodies are called to set up open, accessible systems for implementing freedom of information laws and thus ensuring the public's right to receive the required information. Furthermore, the law should establish an individual right to appeal to an independent body for any refusal by a public body to release information. All members of the public should be in the condition of accessing to <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> without incurring in undue costs and complicated procedures.|$|E
50|$|The {{constitution}} {{provides for}} the right to strike, and workers sometimes exercised it. In small and medium-sized businesses, workers effectively did not have the ability to strike. With an enormous unemployed labor pool, companies could immediately replace any workers attempting to unionize, collectively bargain, or strike, and companies reportedly did so during the year. The law requires unions to have prior consent and to adhere to lengthy mandatory arbitration and <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> before striking. The law prohibits employers and the government from retaliating against strikers; however, the transitional government did not enforce this law in practice and sometimes jailed striking public sector employees.|$|E
5000|$|The {{version of}} the bill that passed the House {{contained}} dramatic changes to the way damages are determined when a court determines that an accused infringer has indeed infringed.The bill specifically limited royalty recovery to the “economic value properly attributable to patent’s specific contributions over the prior art,”—that is, the inventive portion of the claim, as opposed to the whole claim. [...] The bill additionally required a detailed record to be created of the basis for determining damages, presumably for use during <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures,</b> and finally, the bill created new limitations on when the whole market value of an infringing product was used as the royalty base.|$|E
5000|$|Interlocutory Judgment: an {{intermediate}} or interim judgment providing a temporary decision {{on an issue}} that requires timely action. Interlocutory orders are not final and may either not be subject to appeal or may follow a different <b>appeal</b> <b>procedure</b> than other kinds of judgments.|$|R
50|$|An {{applicant}} {{can appeal}} the examiner's decision to the PTAB. The <b>appeal</b> <b>procedure</b> {{is described in}} section 1200 of the U.S. Manual of Patent Examining <b>Procedure</b> (MPEP). Typically, <b>appeals</b> to the PTAB are conducted ex parte. Decisions of the PTAB are typically rendered as an opinion.|$|R

50|$|Specifically, one of {{the major}} {{deficiency}} of freedom of information laws in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the weakness of the provisions concerning the <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> in case the request is rejected. The FOI law of the Republika Srpska does not stipulate an appeal procedure at all. Another problem concerns the lack of compliance with other existing laws that exclude or significantly reduce the right to free access to information in practice both in the Federation and in the Republika Srpska. Also, experts have identified among the shortcomings hindering the application of FOI laws in Bosnia and Herzegovina the lack of an effective system for monitoring their application. Only a small number of public bodies comply with the obligation to publish the information on the number of received questions related to freedom of information on a regular basis.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, Brown {{sponsored}} {{one of the}} new Ed Stelmach government's flagship {{pieces of}} legislation, the Conflicts of Interest Amendment Act, which lengthened the cooling off period during which cabinet ministers and other high-ranking members of government to engage in certain activities after leaving the government's employment. [...] It also placed a requirement on MLAs that they report any personal litigation in which they were engaged, and was supported by all parties. [...] The same year he sponsored the Limitation Statutes Amendment Act, which was also supported by the opposition and which amended Alberta's statute of limitations for some civil matters. [...] Finally, Brown sponsored the <b>Appeal</b> <b>Procedures</b> Statutes Amendment Act. This bill made some amendments to the procedures of the Alberta Court of Appeal. [...] It was supported by Liberals Elsalhy and Maurice Tougas, but Pannu expressed some concern with a provision that would have made the keeping of transcripts of procedures discretionary.|$|E
5000|$|Appeal to the Court of Cassation is only {{possible}} against judgements against which no ordinary appeal is possible anymore. This {{will happen when}} all normal <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> have been followed, usually before the Courts of Appeal or the Courts of Labour. The Court of Cassation can only confirm these judgements, or annul them ("cassation", from the French [...] "casser", to break). It can not examine the case and make a new judgement. The court can annul the entire judgement, or just part of it (D: gedeeltelijke cassatie, F: cassation partielle). If the court annuls a judgement, the case is remitted to a court {{at the same level}} as the one which judgement was overturned. The decision of the Court of Cassation is not (yet) binding, however (article 6 of the Judiciary Code Gerechtelijk Wetboek). The new court may decide the case as it pleases (but the decision of the Court of Cassation has a persuasive value). The decision of the new court may again be appealed to the Court of Cassation. In this case, if the earlier decision of the Court of Cassation is confirmed, the case is brought before a third court at the same level as the one which judgement was overturned, but this time the decision of the Court of Cassation is binding on points of law.|$|E
