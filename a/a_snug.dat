Instead of being <b>a</b> <b>snug</b> fit, it is a loose fit, or a partial fit. Secondly, the caput or acetabulum are not smooth and round, but are misshapen, causing abnormal wear and tear or friction within the joint as it moves.|$|E
25|$|Nowadays {{bandages}} {{of synthetic}} materials are often used, often knitted fiberglass bandages impregnated with polyurethane, sometimes bandages of thermoplastic. These are lighter and dry {{much faster than}} plaster bandages. However, plaster can be more easily moulded to make <b>a</b> <b>snug</b> and therefore more comfortable fit. In addition, plaster is much smoother and does not snag clothing or abrade the skin.|$|E
25|$|Specialty diapers are {{required}} for swimming or pool therapy. These are known as swim diapers or containment swim briefs. They are intended mainly for fecal incontinence, however {{they can also be}} useful for temporary urine containment, to maintain dignity while transferring from change room to pool. Manufacturers such as Discovery Trekking, Splash About and Theraquatics commonly utilize a stretch fabric to allow increased adjustability for <b>a</b> <b>snug</b> fit. They are washable and reusable. There are no disposable adult swim diapers.|$|E

500|$|The {{precursor}} to the underwire bra {{can be traced back}} to at least 1893, when New Yorker Marie Tucek was granted a patent [...] for a [...] "breast supporter". The breast supporter was described as a modification of the corset, and was very similar to a modern push-up bra designed to support the breasts. It consisted of a plate made of metal, cardboard, or other stiff material, shaped to fit against the torso under the breasts, following the contour of the breasts. It was covered with silk, canvas, or other cloth, which extended above the plate to form a pocket for each breast. The plate curved around the torso and ended near the armpits, held in place and adjusted to <b>a</b> <b>snug</b> fit by shoulder straps that crossed the back, forming an X-shape. It was secured with hook-and-eye closures.|$|E
500|$|Brian D. Schiller of Slant Magazine {{gave the}} album {{three and a}} half out of five stars. He stated that [...] "the album is at best another good step toward their once great state and not a full return to it. What's true, though, is that it's the group's best full album since Vitalogy." [...] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club ranked the album B+, {{considering}} it the [...] "tightest Pearl Jam album in a decade", describing the album as a comeback [...] "filled with straight-up, riff-a-riffic rock songs." [...] Mojo gave the album three out of five stars. The review said, [...] "elf-titled with good reason: Pearl Jam sound reborn, vital." [...] Kyle Anderson of Spin gave the album three out of five stars. He said that [...] "rather than rage against the time machine, they seem to be having fun... Pearl Jam are taking themselves less seriously, and it fits them like <b>a</b> <b>snug</b> flannel shirt." [...] Mat Snow of The Guardian also gave the album three out of five stars. In the review he stated that Vedder [...] "musters absolute conviction in writing and singing lyrics of male teenage angst." [...] Snow observed, [...] "And though few of these 13 numbers have the drama of tracks by the Who or Led Zeppelin, from whom the band draw much of their style, Pearl Jam play like men on a mission." [...] David Raposa of Pitchfork called it the [...] "most consistent effort the group's released since its second album," [...] but he added that it [...] "gets pretty boring pretty... quick." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though {{occasionally}} {{made with}} cast bronze, the pot-de-fer was essentially an iron [...] bottle {{with a narrow}} neck. It was loaded with powder and an iron arrow-like bolt, feathered with iron. It is believed that {{the middle of the}} bolt was likely wrapped in leather for <b>a</b> <b>snug</b> fit, necessary to enhance the thrust from the gaseous pressure within the cannon. However, this feature is not shown in manuscript illuminations. The cannon was set off through a small-diameter touchhole, where a red-hot wire could be thrust to set off an explosion and fire the cannon.|$|E

He split every slab, cut every post and wallplate and rafter himself, with a man to help him at odd times; and after the frame was up, and the bark on the roof, he camped underneath and finished every bit of it — chimney, flooring, doors, windows, and partitions — by himself.' ...|$|E

Some of respirators do not provide <b>a</b> <b>snug</b> fit to {{the face of the}} faces. Measurement results showed that the rest in the room with a clean air greatly reduces the impact of air pollution on the workers, and that respirators alone can not reliably protect them. It was also found that the calculation of the protection factors may give different results for different chemicals (for the same measurement carried out).|$|E
50|$|A typical {{printing}} {{operation has}} {{a speed of}} around 15-45 seconds per board. Print head speed is typically 1-8 inches per second. The printing process must be carefully controlled.

"This {{paper was}} {{published}} at five pence, but, as I am informed, {{when the first}} number appeared, so much was it sought after, that, on its first appearance, it was eagerly bought {{in the streets of}} Dublin at one shilling and sixpence and two shillings a number. With the people of Ireland, my lords, this language will tell; and I say it is not safe for you to disregard it. These men are honest; they are not the kind of men who make their patriotism the means of barter for place or pension. They are not to be bought off by the Government of the day for a colonial place, or by <b>a</b> <b>snug</b> situation in the customs or excise. No; they honestly repudiate this course; they are rebels at heart, and they are rebels avowed, who are in earnest in what they say and propose to do.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few decades, the {{disposable}} diaper industry boomed and the competition between Procter & Gamble's Pampers and Kimberly Clark's Huggies resulted in lower prices and drastic changes to diaper design. Several improvements were made, {{such as the use}} of double gussets to improve diaper fit and containment. As stated in Procter & Gamble's initial 1973 patent for the use of double gussets in a diaper, “The double gusset folded areas tend to readily conform to the thigh portions of the leg of the infant. This allows quick and easy fitting and provides <b>a</b> <b>snug</b> and comfortable diaper fit that will neither bind nor wad on the infant…as a result of this snugger fit obtained because of this fold configuration, the diaper is less likely to leak or, in other words, its containment characteristics are greatly enhanced.” Further developments in diaper design were made, such as the introduction of refastenable tapes, the [...] "hourglass shape" [...] so as to reduce bulk at the crotch area, and the 1984 introduction of super-absorbent material from polymers known as sodium polyacrylate that were originally developed in 1966.|$|E
