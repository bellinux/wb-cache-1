5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. <b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E
25|$|Blackface {{performances}} are not unusual within the Latino community. A minstrel tradition exists {{throughout most of}} Latin America and Spain, and it has traveled to the United States. As Spanish-speakers from different countries, ethnic, racial, class, and educational blackgrounds settle in the United States, they have to grapple with being re-classified vis-a-vis other American-born and immigrant groups. Blackface performances have, for instance, tried to work through U.S. racial and ethnic classifications in conflict with national identities. <b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> the representation of Latino and its popular embodiment as a stereotypical Dominican man.|$|E
25|$|How {{permanent}} {{a settlement}} was depended on circumstances. <b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> Irish immigration to North Hastings County, Canada West, which happened after 1846. Most {{of the immigrants}} were attracted to North Hastings by free land grants beginning in 1856. Three Irish settlements were established in North Hastings: Umfraville, Doyle's Corner, and O'Brien Settlement. The Irish were primarily Roman Catholic. Crop failures in 1867 halted the road program near the Irish settlements, and departing settlers afterward outnumbered new arrivals. By 1870, only the successful settlers, {{most of whom were}} farmers who raised grazing animals, remained.|$|E

25|$|Deftly {{traversing}} {{between the}} diverse mediums like painting, video, installation and photography, Rashid Rana {{has emerged as}} one of the leading artist of his generation, making his presence felt globally. His work deals with everyday issues encompassing a wide range of themes from urbanization and popular culture to faith and tradition. He often employs video installations and still photography. <b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> his series of composite photomontages in which each main image is constructed out of countless smaller photos of diametrically opposite subjects. The viewer confronts a moment of sudden withdrawal after moving closer to the picture when one becomes aware of the several tiny images that constitute the larger one.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} {{experimenting with}} new modes of filming, using different directorial methods and techniques. <b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> Ten, which was filmed in a moving automobile in which Kiarostami was not present. He gave suggestions to the actors {{about what to}} do, and a camera placed on the dashboard filmed them while they drove around Tehran. The camera was allowed to roll, capturing {{the faces of the}} people involved during their daily routine, using a series of extreme-close shots. Ten was an experiment that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. This new direction towards a digital micro-cinema is defined as a micro-budget filmmaking practice, allied with a digital production basis.|$|E
25|$|A reconstructed martial art {{necessarily}} {{rests on}} historical records, either combat manuals or pictorial representations. Martial arts reconstruction specifically does not claim an unbroken tradition of some historical martial arts. On the contrary, the {{premise is that}} in an unbroken tradition, styles significantly evolve over time. It is not necessary for the tradition to have been interrupted in order to reconstruct an earlier style; <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> classical fencing which reconstructs the sport fencing of the 19th century before it evolved into current Olympic fencing, or historical German ringen which over time developed into contemporary styles of folk wrestling. Claims of ancient martial arts which survive unchanged by unbroken tradition (e.g. as suggested by Yehoshua Sofer), do not fall under reconstruction and are by their nature unverifiable, even to the person making the claim.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, English-speaking {{fans have}} sought {{clues to the}} story's mysteries by {{examining}} the way {{certain parts of the}} books have been translated in foreign editions. <b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> the identity of a character mentioned by initials only in the book Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The English initials R.A.B. could have belonged to several minor characters from the books, but variations on the initials in other languages gave evidence to the true identity of the mystery character: in the Dutch edition of the book R.A.B. was translated into R.A.Z., 'zwart' being Dutch for 'black'; in the Norwegian edition, R.A.B. translates to 'R.A.S.', svart being Norwegian for 'black'; and in the Finnish edition the initials were R.A.M., 'musta' being Finnish for 'black'. Fans took this to mean that the character was Regulus Black, the brother of Sirius Black; when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was published, this was revealed to be the case.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1950s, Afro-Cuban jazz {{had been}} using modes {{for at least a}} decade, as much of it {{borrowed}} from Cuban popular dance forms which are structured around multiple ostinatos with only a few chords. <b>A</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> Mario Bauza's [...] "Tanga" [...] (1943), the first Afro-Cuban jazz piece. Machito's Afro-Cubans recorded modal tunes in the 1940s, featuring jazz soloists such as Howard McGhee, Brew Moore, Charlie Parker, and Flip Phillips. However, {{there is no evidence that}} Davis or other mainstream jazz musicians were influenced by the use of modes in Afro-Cuban jazz, or other branches of Latin jazz.|$|E

It is perfectly possible to represent this in a Force Dynamic diagram (representing Chet’s will as the Agonist keeping the body — the Antagonist — in motion). Thus, even though Chet is one person, his will and his body are conceptualized separately.|$|E
