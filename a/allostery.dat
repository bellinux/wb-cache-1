2500|$|In his PhD thesis, Changeux {{suggested}} that the recognition and transmission of signals by membrane, and in particular by synapses, could use the same mechanisms as the allosteric regulation of enzymes. More than forty years of research would follow, mainly focussed on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (see below). In 1967, Changeux extended the MWC model to bi-dimensional lattice of receptors [...] (an idea that would also be developed three decades afterward by Dennis Bray). He then applied this idea to the post-synaptic membrane of electric organs (analog to striated muscle). His team demonstrated the existence of several interconvertible states for the nicotinic receptor, resting, open and desensitized, displaying different affinities for the ligands, such as the endogenous agonist acetylcholine. The transitions between the states followed different kinetics, and those kinetics plus the differential affinities sufficed to explain {{the shape of the}} post-synaptic potential. A full mechanistic model of the nicotinic receptor from striated muscle (or electric organ) was to be provided much later, when Changeux collaborated with Stuart Edelstein, another specialist of <b>allostery,</b> who worked decades on hemoglobin. In addition to the allosteric modulation of the channel gating by the agonists, many other regulations of the ligand-gated ion channels activity have since been discovered. The modulators bind to a variety of allosteric sites, whether on the agonist binding sites, other binding sites at the subunit interfaces, on the cytoplasmic part of the protein or in the transmembrane domain.|$|E
2500|$|Multicellular animals {{also have}} a type of kinase closely related to Raf: this is the Kinase Suppressor of Ras (KSR). Vertebrates like mammals have two, paralogous KSR genes instead of one: KSR1 and KSR2. Their C-terminal kinase domain {{is very similar to}} Raf (originally called CA5 in KSR and CR3 in Raf), but the N-terminal {{regulatory}} region differs. Although they also have the flexible hinge (CA4 in KSR) and a C1 domain (CA3 in KSR) before it, KSRs entirely lack the Ras-binding domain. Instead, they have unique regulatory regions on their N-termini, originally termed CA1 ("conserved area 1") and CA2. For a long time, the structure of the CA1 domain was a mystery. However, in 2012, the structure of the CA1 region in KSR1 was solved: {{it turned out to be}} a divergent SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain, supplemented with coiled-coils (CC-SAM): this is supposed to aid KSRs in membrane binding. KSRs, like Rafs, also have the twin 14-3-3 associating motifs (that depend on phosphorylation), but also possess novel MAPK-binding motifs on [...] their hinge regions. With a typical sequence Phe-x-Phe-Pro (FxFP) these motifs are important for the feedback regulation of Raf kinases in the ERK1/2 pathway. According to our current knowledge, KSRs also participate in the same pathway as Raf, although they only play an auxiliary role. With a very poor intrinsic kinase activity, they were long thought to be inactive, until their catalytic activity was finally demonstrated in recent years. But even then, they contribute only negligibly to MKK1 and MKK2 phosphorylation. The main role of KSR appears to be to provide a heterodimerization partner to Raf enzymes, greatly facilitating their activation by means of <b>allostery.</b> Similar phenomena [...] were described for other MAP3 kinases. ASK2, for example, is a poor enzyme on its own, and it activity appears to be tied to ASK1/ASK2 heterodimerisation.|$|E

50|$|The Bohr effect hinges around {{allosteric}} {{interactions between}} the hemes of the haemoglobin tetramer, a mechanism first proposed by Max Perutz in 1970. Haemoglobin exists in two conformations: a high-affinity R state and a low-affinity T state. When oxygen concentration levels are high, as in the lungs, the R state is favored, enabling {{the maximum amount of}} oxygen to be bound to the hemes. In the capillaries, where oxygen concentration levels are lower, the T state is favored, in order to facilitate the delivery of oxygen to the tissues. The Bohr effect is dependent on this <b>allostery,</b> as increases in CO2 and H+ help stabilize the T state and ensure greater oxygen delivery to muscles during periods of elevated cellular respiration. This is evidenced by the fact that myoglobin, a monomer with no <b>allostery,</b> does not exhibit the Bohr effect. Haemoglobin mutants with weaker <b>allostery</b> may exhibit a reduced Bohr effect. For example, in Hiroshima variant haemoglobinopathy, <b>allostery</b> in haemoglobin is reduced, and the Bohr effect is diminished. As a result, during periods of exercise, the mutant haemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen and tissue may suffer minor oxygen starvation.|$|E
5000|$|Ensemble {{models of}} {{allosteric}} regulation enumerate an allosteric system's statistical ensemble {{as a function}} of its [...] potential energy function, and then relate specific statistical measurements of <b>allostery</b> to specific energy terms in the energy function (such as an intermolecular salt bridge between two domains). Ensemble models like the Ensemble Allosteric Model [...] and Allosteric Ising Model [...] assume that each domain of the system can adopt two states similar to the MWC model. The <b>allostery</b> landscape model introduced by Cuendet, Weinstein, and LeVine [...] allows for the domains to have any number of states and the contribution of a specific molecular interaction to a given allosteric coupling can be estimated using a rigorous set of rules. Molecular dynamics simulations can be used to estimate a systems's statistical ensemble {{so that it can be}} analyzed with the <b>allostery</b> landscape model.|$|E

50|$|<b>Allostery</b> is {{a direct}} and {{efficient}} means for regulation of biological macromolecule function, produced by the binding of a ligand at an allosteric site topographically distinct from the orthosteric site.

The AlloSteric Database (ASD, http://mdl.shsmu.edu.cn/ASD) provides a central resource for the display, search and analysis of the structure, function and related annotation for allosteric molecules. Currently, ASD contains allosteric proteins from more than 100 species and modulators in three categories (activators, inhibitors, and regulators). Each protein is annotated with detailed description of <b>allostery,</b> biological process and related diseases, and each modulator with binding affinity, physicochemical properties and therapeutic area. Integrating the information of allosteric proteins in ASD should allow the prediction of <b>allostery</b> for unknown proteins, to be followed with experimental validation. In addition, modulators curated in ASD can be used to investigate potential allosteric targets for a query compound, and can help chemists to implement structure modifications for novel allosteric drug design.|$|E

50|$|A non-regulatory {{allosteric}} site is any non-regulatory component of an enzyme (or any protein), {{that is not}} itself an amino acid. For instance, many enzymes require sodium binding to ensure proper function. However, the sodium does not necessarily act as a regulatory subunit; the sodium is always present {{and there are no}} known biological processes to add/remove sodium to regulate enzyme activity. Non-regulatory <b>allostery</b> could comprise any other ions besides sodium (calcium, magnesium, zinc), as well as other chemicals and possibly vitamins.|$|E
50|$|The fI {{heavy chain}} has four domains: a FIMAC domain, a Scavenger Receptor Cysteine Rich (SRCR) domain and two LDL-receptor Class A domains; the heavy chain plays an {{inhibitory}} role {{in maintaining the}} enzyme inactive until it meets the complex formed by the substrate (either C3b or C4b) and a cofactor protein (Factor H, CR1, MCP or C4BP). Upon binding of the enzyme to the substrate:cofactor complex, the heavy:light chain interface is disrupted, and the enzyme activated by <b>allostery.</b> The LDL-receptor domains contain one Calcium-binding site each.|$|E
5000|$|Enzymes {{composed}} of subunits with diverse functions are sometimes called holoenzymes, {{in which some}} parts may be known as regulatory subunits and the functional core {{is known as the}} catalytic subunit. Other assemblies referred to instead as multiprotein complexes also possess quaternary structure. Examples include nucleosomes and microtubules. Changes in quaternary structure can occur through conformational changes within individual subunits or through reorientation of the subunits relative to each other.

The backbone flexibility within calmodulin is key to its ability to bind a wide range of targets. Protein domains, connected by intrinsically disordered flexible linker domains, induce long-range <b>allostery,</b> or the conformational change of a protein by ligand binding to an allosteric site (a site other than the functional site), via protein domain dynamics.|$|E

50|$|In the {{nonconducting}} conformation of KcsA at pH 7, K+ {{is bound}} tightly to coordinating oxygens of the selectivity filter {{and the four}} TM2 helices converge near the cytoplasmic junction to block the passage of any potassium ions. At pH 4 however, KcsA undergoes millisecond-timescale conformational exchanges filter permeating and nonpermeating states and between the open and closed conformations of the M2 helices. While these distinct conformational changes occur in separate regions of the channel, the molecular behavior of each region is linked by both electrostatic interactions and <b>allostery.</b> The dynamics of this exchange stereochemical configurations in the filter provides the physical basis for simultaneous K+ conductance and gating.|$|E

The model further holds that, in the absence of any ligand (substrate or otherwise), the equilibrium favors one of the conformational states, T or R. The equilibrium can be shifted to the R or T state through the binding of one ligand (the allosteric effector or ligand) to a site that is different from the active site (the allosteric site).|$|E
