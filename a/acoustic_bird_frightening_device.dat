40|$|Wildlife {{is often}} {{responsible}} for causing extensive damage to personal property, {{human health and}} safety concerns, and other nuisance problems because of their feeding, roosting, breeding, and loafing habits. <b>Frightening</b> <b>devices</b> are tools used in integrated wildlife damage management to reduce the impacts of animals, but the effectiveness of such devices is often variable. An animal’s visual and auditory capabilities affect how the animal will respond to a stimulus. <b>Frightening</b> <b>devices</b> include pyrotechnics, gas exploders, effigies, lights, lasers, reflective objects, guard animals, bioacoustics, and ultrasonic devices. We examined scientific literature {{on the use of}} <b>frightening</b> <b>devices</b> to reduce <b>bird</b> and mammal depredation and compiled results to determine the effectiveness of such devices. When used in an integrated system, <b>frightening</b> <b>devices</b> may be more effective than when used alone. We conclude that the total elimination of damage may be impossible, but <b>frightening</b> <b>devices</b> and/or combinations of devices are useful in reducing wildlife damage. Ultrasonic <b>frightening</b> <b>devices</b> are ineffective in repelling birds and mammals whereas other devices offer some protection. The timely use of a variety of <b>frightening</b> <b>devices</b> can be part of a cost-effective integrated system to reduce wildlife damage to tolerable levels...|$|R

The aim of the work Evaluation {{of the issue}} of young roe deer mortality during haymaking in Semilsko was the research of technical text on selected issues as well as the analysis of the hunting of Vošmenda Valley Hunting Association. On the basis of this analysis, three sites of the similar size were chosen. Subsequently, various <b>frightening</b> <b>devices</b> were placed there and the mortality of young roe deer during haymaking was studied. The next aim was the evaluation of the ratio of the loss of roe deer to measures used. The <b>frightening</b> <b>devices</b> used in order to achieve these goals were: the scent fence along with a mechanical <b>frightening</b> <b>device</b> (polystyrene boards hanging on a stick), passing through the area with a hunting dog and the site without any protective measure. The result of the work was a comparison of these sites with the mortality of young roe deer when using different protective measures.

40|$|Domestic sheep {{ranching}} is {{an important}} agricultural industry in the United States and coyote (Canis latrans) depredation on lambs and ewes continues to challenge ranchers and agencies responsible for protecting sheep. Lethal methods used in controlling coyote depredation include aerial gunning, toxicants, trapping, and calling and shooting. Nonlethal methods include <b>frightening</b> <b>devices,</b> fences, livestock protection animals, and stringent husbandry practices. Ranchers and agencies responsible for controlling coyote depredation need <b>frightening</b> <b>devices</b> that are more effective than those currently available. We describe a field evaluation of 2 animal-activated frightening devices: an acoustic device and an acoustic device with a pop-up scarecrow and strobe light. We conducted the evaluation on open range in western Wyoming during the lambing period. No coyote kills were reported during 6, 087 sheepnights at 3 sites protected by the acoustic devices or during 6, 598 sheepnights at 3 sites protected by the acoustic scarecrow devices.

Systematic exploders were calibrated to detonate once at 8 to 10 min intervals, whereas motion-activated exploders detonated 8 times/deer intrusion. Systematic propane exploders were generally ineffective, deterring deer from corn for 3 ̆c 2 days only, whereas motion-activated exploders repelled deer for O- 6 weeks. Repellency of motion-activated exploders varied seasonally, possibly in {{response to}} variations in deer density, availability of alternate food, or reproductive and social behavior.

Performance is reported in terms of recognition accuracy on audio-frame level, due to the restrictions imposed by the requirement of run-time decision making with limited memory and energy resources.

Recent research using laser technology to disperse a variety of bird species has yielded promising results, prompting wildlife professionals and the public to question whether lasers could play a role in reducing damage and conflict with mammals, primarily deer. We evaluated 2 red lasers (63 - 650 nm) to determine their effectiveness as <b>devices</b> to <b>frighten</b> deer.
