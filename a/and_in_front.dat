5|$|From {{late morning}} to early afternoon, another squall line moved through {{northern}} parts of Mississippi and Alabama as high wind shear and low-level moisture persisted. However, this time several discrete supercells developed along <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the line, spawning seven weak tornadoes across Morgan, Limestone, and Madison Counties in northern Alabama around noon that day.|$|E
5|$|An {{international}} {{version of}} the video was also officially released. This version is {{almost exactly the same}} as the original, with the only difference being that some early shots were Spears dances in front of the multicolored background are replaced by shots of Spears with a short blonde bob wig wearing a purple dress <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a black background with flashing lights.|$|E

5|$|Below <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the {{striatum}} are {{a number}} of basal forebrain structures. These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal nucleus. These structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The basal forebrain, in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn Rovers {{also started}} their {{campaign}} in the first round, where they won their first game at home against Southport Central 7–1. The second round saw them drawn away to South Shore at Blackpool resulting in a further victory {{by a margin of}} 7–0. They defeated Padiham 3–0 in the third round, once again at their home ground of Leamington Street, and in the fourth round against Staveley 5–1 in a match which was dominated by Rovers <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a crowd of 3000 spectators.|$|E
5|$|Both Hougoumont and Papelotte were {{fortified}} and garrisoned, {{and thus}} anchored Wellington's flanks securely. Papelotte also commanded {{the road to}} Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On {{the western side of}} the main road, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of La Haye Sainte, which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion. On {{the opposite side of the}} road was a disused sand quarry, where the 95th Rifles were posted as sharpshooters.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln, Old Bob was again brought out of retirement. During the cortège preceding the funeral in Springfield, Old Bob was caparisoned in a black mourning blanket trimmed with silver fringe and tassels. Henry Brown, an African Methodist Episcopal minister and friend of the Lincoln family, led Old Bob, whose spot in the procession was immediately behind the hearse <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the carriage carrying Robert Todd Lincoln. It {{has been said that}} Robert Lincoln and Old Bob were the only members of Lincoln's family present at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|In June and July 2002, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma {{sponsored}} the first National Intercollegiate Marching Band, which {{traveled to the}} French Riviera, including the cities of Nice, Grasse, Aix-en-Provence, Cannes, Antibes, and the Principality of Monaco. The thirty-five member band performed at Le Suquet in Cannes, in Nice, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the Prince's Palace of Monaco. After the inaugural trip, the program was dissolved by the joint national councils due to its high cost and low attendance, which {{was believed to be}} caused by a fear of traveling abroad after the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|In {{this type}} of legion, the 900 principes formed 15 maniples, {{military}} units of 60 men each. The principes stood in the second battle line, behind hastati of the first line <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the triarii in the third. In a pitched battle, the leves, javelin armed light infantry would form up {{at the front of}} the legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire to cover the advance of the hastati, light spearmen.|$|E

5|$|In {{this type}} of new Roman legion, the 900 triarii formed 15 maniples, {{military}} units of 60 men each, which were in turn part of 15 , larger units {{made up of a}} maniple of triarii, a maniple of rorarii and a maniple of accensi. The triarii stood in the third line of the legion, behind the front line of hastati and the second line of principes, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the rorarii and accensi. In a pitched battle, the leves, javelin-armed skirmishers who were attached to maniples of hastati, would form up {{at the front of the}} legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire and cover the advance of the hastati, spear armed infantry.|$|E
5|$|Stephenson {{built the}} {{locomotive}} originally as an 0-4-0 (an 0-4-0 is the Whyte notation for a steam locomotive with two powered axles and no unpowered leading or trailing axles). The locomotive's power was {{transmitted to the}} driving axles through pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two front wheels <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the front axle. These inside cylinders' main rods were connected to a rear crank axle with a connecting rod between the two axles to power the front axle.|$|E
5|$|The Torah ark had the {{capacity}} to house 50 Torah scrolls and was built on two levels. It was flanked by four Corinthian columns surrounded by baroque woodcuts depicting flowers and birds. The Ark, together with its ornamental gates, were taken from the Nikolayevsky Synagogue in Kherson, Russia, which had been used by Russian Jewish conscripts forced to spend twenty-five years in the Imperial Russian Army. Directly above the Ark was a triangular window with rounded points. To the right <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the ark was the cantor's podium, which was designed as a miniature version of the two-level Ark.|$|E

5|$|The {{reflector}} sight mechanism {{was mounted}} {{in front of}} the gyro, slightly to the left. A metal flap protected the half-mirror from damage when stowed, which was rotated rearward during use, covering the spirit level. The collimator was mounted on a prominent arm that projected above <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the sight when in use, and folded forward when stored. Electrical power was provided to light the collimator as well as the drift scale, which indicated the angle to fly to correct for the wind drift.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{had a pair}} of horns above <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the eyes. These horns were {{composed}} of extensions of the lacrimal bones, and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the nasal bones that led into the horns. The horns were probably covered in a keratin sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eye, being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species (although they were fragile). There was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in tyrannosaurids.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{esophagus}} lies at {{the back}} of the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column. The lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta. From the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At this point it passes through the diaphragm.|$|E

5|$|With ESPN's College GameDay in town <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a {{sold out}} Williams–Brice, Alabama was {{upset by the}} South Carolina Gamecocks 35–21. After Alabama scored on its opening drive with a 32-yard Jeremy Shelley field goal, South Carolina responded with three {{consecutive}} touchdowns. Stephen Garcia threw three touchdown passes, with the first to Marcus Lattimore for nine-yards followed by strikes of 26 and 15-yards to Alshon Jeffery, to give South Carolina a 21–3 lead in the second quarter. Alabama reached the end zone late in the second on a nine-yard Greg McElroy pass to Julio Jones to make the halftime score 21–9 after the extra point failed.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of air-to-air {{exercises}} and practice the Wing undertook a Circus operation on 3 August 1941. In the evening the Wing crossed out over Manston at 18,000ft and then dropped to 13,000ft over the coast at Gravelines and set course for Saint Omer. Near Ambleteuse five Bf 109Fs were sighted one thousand feet above <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> travelling past the Spitfires. The German fighters shadowed the flight before three detached and dived to attack, curving in from behind. The Spitfires turned into them. Finucane missed with his first burst of fire and chased the leading Bf 109 into cloud while following the Bf 109's condensation trail. Hitting the enemy with another burst from 200 yards the Bf 109 burst into flames. He sighted another formation of 18 Bf 109s above and climbed to attack supported by six Spitfires. Finucane scored hits on the tail unit of one which went down vertically and into a cloud layer at 2,000ft at which point contact was lost. Finucane claimed one destroyed and one probably destroyed. The operation elevated his tally to 7. The day was best remembered in Fighter Command {{for the loss of}} Flight Lieutenant Eric Lock who was shot down by ground-fire in the morning patrol.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 19, Harvey was the {{youngest}} player of the touring party—more than six and half years younger {{than all the other}} members of the squad. An attacking left-handed middle-order batsman, Harvey had become {{the youngest}} Australian to score a Test century, by making 153 in the Fifth Test against India in the preceding Australian summer. However, Harvey struggled early in the tour and had difficulty adapting to English conditions. After being omitted from the first-choice team in the early part of the tour, Harvey's performances improved with increasing familiarity with local conditions, and he was called into the team for the Fourth Test, where he batted at No. 5 behind Miller <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Loxton due to the injury to Barnes. Upon Barnes’ return for the Fifth Test, the trio were each pushed down one position.|$|E
