I wanted people to really {{have a great time}} watching this film [...] if somewhere in the mix we lobbed <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>big</b> ideas at them, well, then that would be even better." [...] One of Meyer's earlier films, Time After Time, was largely based in San Francisco; when he was told by the producers that The Voyage Home had to be set in the same city, he took the opportunity to comment upon cultural aspects not covered by his earlier film, such as punk rock—The Voyage Homes scene where Kirk and Spock meet an annoying punk rocker was based on a similar scene cut from Time After Time.|$|E

Indiaglitz stated that [...] "the unique stamp of Harris can be felt throughout the disc, and that makes songs [...] a treat to senses", recommending it for [...] "those who love and appreciate good music". Pavithra Srinivasan from Rediff provided 2.5/5, mentioning that [...] "it looks like Harris Jeyaraj has run out of steam.

Although West read for Fry, his friend Charlie Schlatter was initially given the role of Fry. Due to a casting change, West was called back to audition again and was given the role. West claims that the voice of Fry is deliberately modeled on his own, so as to make it difficult for another person to replicate the voice. Doctor Zoidberg's voice was based on Lou Jacobi and George Jessel. The character of Zapp Brannigan was originally created and intended to be performed by Phil Hartman. Hartman insisted on auditioning for the role, and [...] "just nailed it" [...] according to Groening. Due to Hartman's death, West was given the role. West states that his version of Zapp Brannigan was an imitation of Hartman and also [...] "modeled after <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>big</b> dumb announcers I knew".|$|E

Stopps subsequently {{said that if the}} first gig hadn’t have been a success, he would have closed Friars and taken up a career in advertising. As it was, that first gig on 17 April 1971 was a complete sellout featuring The Groundhogs and local act John Otway.Having successfully presented David Bowie twice in 1971 and early 1972, the third appearance on 15 July 1972 is seen by many as the greatest ever Friars Aylesbury concert when Bowie unveiled his Ziggy Stardust persona on the Aylesbury audience and many members of the press, including US journalists, who had been flown in especially for the occasion. 1972 saw performances too by Genesis, Lou Reed and Roxy Music as their reputations were taking off.Friars in this time presented two open air festivals in Rabans Lane in Aylesbury in 1973 and 1974.The years up to the end of Phase Two saw memorable performances from Mott the Hoople, the breakthrough of Cockney Rebel (who played four times in 1974 including a hastily arranged gig after scenes of pandemonium at one sold out gig), Sailor and Dr Feelgood and many more.Phase Two came to an end in August 1975 when the hall closed in favour of the new purpose built Civic Centre and Friars relocated there.|$|R

There was an air of great quietude and coolness about the pointed arches of its tiny cloister on that summer's day, with the old monk dozing in his chair over the manuscript he thought he was reading, not far from the little table where the Warden was eagerly studying Erasmus's Praise of Folly. But the Birkenholts were of the age at which quiet means dulness, at least Stephen was, and the Warden had pity both on them and on himself; and hearing joyous shouts outside, he opened a little door in the cloister wall, and revealed a multitude of lads with their black gowns tucked up [...] "a playing at the ball"--these being the scholars of St. Mary's.

40|$|Aim: Nation Branding {{has become}} an {{important}} phenomenon during the last <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years. The concept talks about how to promote a product by using the features of a nation to gain profit. Among the years many countries has established a strong Nation Brand abroad. In the long run many companies have chosen to use these benefits in an efficient way by promoting their own country brand, especially in their internationalization process. The {{aim of this study}} is to see what factors that influence companies in the Swedish food industry while using the fact that they are Swedish when they enter foreign markets.   Method: Data was collected through interviews with export managers and sales managers at 6 Swedish companies exporting products within the food industry. The study was also based on secondary data with the purpose to give a complete image how Sweden is represented abroad. The chosen literature is based on <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> the <b>biggest</b> researchers among the fields of Nation Branding and cultural dimensions.   Result & Conclusions: One result that was obtained after our study was that brands or products with characteristics consistent with the image that the consumers had about the country before, can gain its value by highlighting its origin. Further, it was being proved that a company’s use of Nation Branding in some way could be affected by the countries cultural distance, or in what stage of the internationalization process the company is.   Contribution of the thesis: The contribution of this thesis is to give more knowledge about which qualities a country like Sweden can generate with its products. A country being perceived with its values like reliability, trustworthiness, uniqueness and quality can create an image and a successful strategy to establish on new markets and to gain profit from that. ...|$|R

And here I may observe of the very little wooden lighthouse, that when it is lighted at night, - red and green, - it looks so like a medical man's, that several distracted husbands have at various times been found, on occasions of premature domestic anxiety, going round and round it, trying to find the Nightbell.|$|R
