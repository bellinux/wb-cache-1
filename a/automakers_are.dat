In the non-luxury category, the worst offender is the Volkswagen Touareg Hybrid, which reduces less than a 10% of greenhouse emissions, an all-time low on the scorecard. According to the UCS, the [...] "Touareg was singled out {{as an example of}} a [...] "muscle" [...] hybrid that emphasized power over fuel efficiency."

[...] General Motors has invested heavily in all fuel cell equipped vehicles, while Chrysler is focusing much of its research and development into biodiesel. Two days after the September 11, 2001 attacks, GM announced it had developed the world's most powerful fuel cell stack capable of powering large commercial vehicles. In 2002, the state of Michigan established NextEnergy, a non-profit corporation whose purpose is to enable commercialization of various energy technologies, especially hydrogen fuel cells. Its main complex is located north of Wayne State University. In August 2009, Michigan and Detroit's auto industry received $1.36 B in grants from the U.S. Department of Energy for the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries which are expected to generate 6,800 immediate jobs and employ 40,000 in the state by 2020.|$|E

50|$|Following Mercedes {{claims that}} the new {{refrigerant}} could be ignited, Germany's Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (Federal Motor Transport Authority) conducted its own tests. The Authority concluded that while the substance was potentially more hazardous than previously used R-134a, it did not comprise a serious danger. However the German automakers disagree with their findings, and test procedures. Following other independent and in house testing, General Motors still plans to transition all new models to the new refrigerant by 2018. Chrysler announced that they would continue the transition to R1234yf as well. Japanese <b>automakers</b> <b>are</b> also making the transition to R1234yf, Honda and Subaru have begun to introduce the new refrigerant already with the 2017 models.|$|E

50|$|The {{government}} groups {{found that}} the auto industry has been {{doing a good job}} innovating and pushing towards lowering greenhouse gas emissions.

Still, the paper says that the 54.5 mpg goal is unrealistic. That goal was based off a market that was 67 percent cars and 33 percent trucks and SUVs. American customers aren't buying that many cars—the market is still about 50/50 and will likely stay that way. The paper says more realistic goals are 50 mpg to 52.6.|$|E
