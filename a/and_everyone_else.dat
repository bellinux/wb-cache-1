5|$|In May 1809, {{the rebels}} {{captured}} Sjenica. They repulsed an Ottoman {{attack on the}} village of Suvodol in early June, and seized Novi Pazar later that month, but failed to take its fortress. Lacking numbers and adequate military training, they failed to establish a corridor to Montenegro and never came close to the Adriatic Sea. Karađorđe had described acquiring access to the sea {{as one of his}} key aims. The rebels experienced further setbacks in Niš, where 3,000 were surrounded at Čegar Hill in May–June 1809. Knowing that he and his men would be impaled if captured, rebel commander Stevan Sinđelić fired at his entrenchment's gun powder magazine, setting off a massive explosion that killed him <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> in the vicinity. On the site of the battle, the Ottoman commander Hurshid Pasha built a stone tower with the skulls of Sinđelić and his fighters embedded in its walls as a warning to others who wished to rebel.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman Empire {{was known}} to create tower {{structures}} from the skulls of rebel fighters in order to elicit terror among its opponents. The First Serbian Uprising against Ottoman rule erupted in February 1804, with Đorđe Petrović (Karađorđe) as its leader. On 19 May 1809, 3,000 Serbian rebels {{under the command of}} Stevan Sinđelić were attacked by the Ottomans on Čegar Hill, in Niš. The rebels were plagued by lack of coordination, largely due to the rivalry between commanders Milivoje Petrovic and Petar Dobrnjac. As a result, Sinđelić's fighters failed to receive support from the other rebel detachments. The numerically superior Ottomans lost thousands of soldiers in a number of failed attacks against the rebels, but eventually overwhelmed the Serbian lines. Knowing that he and his men would be impaled if captured, Sinđelić fired at his entrenchment's gun powder magazine, setting off a massive explosion. The resulting blast killed him <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> in the vicinity.|$|E

In other words, the three primary genetic divisions of humanity are the Hadza, the Juǀʼhoan and relatives, <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else.</b> Because two of the three groups speak languages with clicks, perhaps their common ancestral language, which by implication is the ancestral language for all humankind, had clicks as well.|$|E

25|$|This {{game was}} part of a double header at the Garda RFC Westmanstown. The Vikings {{entering}} the game as huge underdogs {{for the first time in}} many years. Making matters worse the Vikings lost starting QB Marc Ashworth and Starting RB Ryan Meches to unforeseen circumstances leaving them with a 22-man squad facing the Champions. The game started positively for the Vikings on offence gathering some first downs and field position. The Defence which was the story of the day matched the champions in every aspect and looked a better outfit than the one that lost to Belfast in the Shamrock bowl the year before. As the first half came to a close the score was a measly 0–0 with both teams showing why they have been dominant in Irish football in recent years. The Vikings cam out in the second half hoping to get some movement on offence with their Defence continuing to be Dominant and impressive. The Vikings turned to players like ever present Kieran Coen to play both sides of the ball and he was the best player on the field on the day. With many other players such as Ian Cahill, Craig Switzer, Michael Guinane, Kieran Coen, Adrian Garvey and Sean Goldrick playing Offence, Defence and Special teams the game started to wear on the Vikings. 0-0 entering the 4th quarter in unprecedented 28 degree heat there was an air of inevitability about the game with the Vikings continually running 3 and outs on offence something had to give. With less than 10 minutes left and the Trojans creeping into Viking territory there was a sense that a big play needed to be made on Defence if they were going to have a shot of knocking off the Trojans. That chance came with a well read pass from the Trojans QB by Craig Switzer. The ball in his hands with 60 yards of clear field in front of the speedster nickel star of the Vikings and he took his eye off the ball and it fell on the turf. The crowd, the team <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> knew that was the chance and sure enough 3 plays later the Trojans constant Barrage finally broke the Vikings Defensive wall and ran in for a 20-yard score with 7 minutes left. The Trojans stopped the Vikings offense after some gutsy first downs by QB Paul Keane, RB/DL Ian Cahill and WR Sean Goldrick. The Trojans played the clock down to minutes left and with the game getting away from them the Vikings Defence gave up another score leaving it 14–0 final score.|$|E
