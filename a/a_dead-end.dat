5|$|Before the {{construction}} of I-684, NY22 continued northeast along Sodom Road north of Brewster on what is now CR50, <b>a</b> <b>dead-end</b> road maintained by Putnam County. Modern NY22 joins the I-684 roadway at exit10 (the northern terminus of I-684) and connects to the surface road {{on the opposite side}} of the Croton River via the NY981B connector. South of Copake Falls, the state also still maintains an old alignment designated as NY980F. North of Copake Falls, the northern half of the original alignment was designated as an extension of NY344.|$|E
5|$|The {{alignment}} of State Route 237 began at an intersection with its parent highway, State Route 37 in Lackawaxen Township, near Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct. This {{is currently the}} intersection with State Route 590. The highway heads eastward {{along the banks of}} the Delaware River and a nearby railroad track towards Shohola Township. There is an intersection with Delaware Drive just after the inception. Delaware Drive heads to <b>a</b> <b>dead-end</b> at the banks of the Delaware River. The highway passes some homes to the north and a dense forest to the south. There is also a mansion atop a nearby hill. After a clearing, the highway enters the dense forest completely and turns to the southeast.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{looking for a}} {{projectile}} {{a few yards away}} from the body of a man shot to death. The man's girlfriend (Oni Faida Lampley), who {{was shot in the head}} during the incident but survived, tells police during questioning that her aunt Calpurnia Church hired a hitman to kill her for insurance money. The detectives learn Church previously collected life insurance from five deceased husbands. Suspecting Church of murdering her husbands, Lewis and Crosetti have the body of her most recent husband exhumed for an autopsy, but reach <b>a</b> <b>dead-end</b> when it turns out to be the wrong body in his grave.|$|E
5|$|There {{is still}} a {{functioning}} farm in Salta, which is passed on the lane accessing the hamlet. There are other farms in Mawbray and Allonby, and the hamlet is surrounded by farmland belonging to these local farmers. Though the road through the hamlet comes to <b>a</b> <b>dead-end,</b> and is accessed by lane only from the coastal B5300 road or Mawbray, two public bridleways at the end provide access over the fields to Hailforth and Mawbray, with the latter emerging {{right next to the}} pub in the centre of the village. A caravan park, Manor House Park, is situated across the peat to the southeast, to the southwest of the hamlet of Edderside.|$|E
5|$|CR149 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY52 {{in the community}} of Youngsville. The route progresses northward, passing and paralleling Tremper Road, <b>a</b> <b>dead-end</b> road. CR149 passes by several residential homes in Youngsville, along with one local commercial building. After leaving the community, CR149 continues to the north as Shandelee Road, passing through the residential surroundings. After passing by a few more residences, Shandelee Road makes a bend to the northwest, and into more dense woodlands in the area. About a mile north of Youngsville, CR149 continues its way northward, passing by a local residence, and intersects with Stump Pond Road, which heads westward from the main highway. Shandalee Road makes another bend, this time to the north, passing through moderate development for about another mile. A short distance into the bend, the woodlands that were surrounding the highway clear and the highway becomes surrounded by fields and residential homes.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the Keeler Street Expressway, a limited-access highway extending across Irondequoit from the Genesee River (at the Veterans Memorial Bridge) to the Sea Breeze Expressway. The first section from North Goodman Street to the Sea Breeze Expressway was completed by 1968 while the remainder opened in late 1969. The name of the expressway was derived from Keeler Street, a small residential street that originally connected to East Ridge Road and St. Paul Street {{by way of a}} traffic circle on the east bank of the Genesee River. The street was turned into <b>a</b> <b>dead-end</b> street {{as a result of the}} expressway's construction. US104 was moved from East Ridge Road to the expressway, which remains known, albeit infrequently, as the Keeler Street Expressway to this day. NY18 remained on East Ridge Road, however, reducing the overlap between US104 and NY18 to just the portion on the Veterans Bridge. NY18 was truncated to its current eastern terminus , eliminating the overlap entirely.|$|E
5|$|At the {{intersection}} with Seashore Road (County Route 603), {{the designation of}} Route 626 picks up again, following Seashore Road northward through rural Cape May County. The route leaves the rural area, intersecting with U.S. Route 9 (Sandman Boulevard), where the commercial district picks up. County Route 626 heads northward through the short district, entering an area of residences and intersecting with Academy Road (County Route 639). The route passes a large field with one large red barn before turning northeastward past more residences. County Route 626 parallels U.S. Route 9 for a distance, intersecting with the Bennetts Crossing, which connects the two roads. The highway continues northeastward through Cape May County, intersecting with Tabernacle Road (County Route 647). County Route 626 continues through the residential districts in Lower Township, paralleling U.S. Route 9 and a local railroad for some distance. The highway intersects with the Old Stage Road, <b>a</b> <b>dead-end</b> stagecoach road, heading through a short rural area {{before returning to the}} residential districts. The highway continues northward, switch names to South Railroad Avenue and into the community of Rio Grande. County Route 626 becomes a divided highway before reaching an intersection with New Jersey Route 47, where county maintenance ends completely. North Railroad Avenue continues locally along the right-of-way.|$|E
5|$|Bond calls Tree to enquire further {{about the}} payment of his fee and is told {{to go to the}} Tiara Hotel in Las Vegas. The Tiara is owned by Seraffimo Spang and {{operates}} as the headquarters of the Spangled Mob. Spang also owns an old Western ghost town, named Spectreville, restored to be his own private holiday retreat. At the hotel Bond finally receives payment through a rigged blackjack game where the dealer is Tiffany. After winning the money he is owed he disobeys his orders from Tree by continuing to gamble in the casino and wins heavily. Spang suspects that Bond may be a 'plant' and has him captured and tortured at Spectreville. With Tiffany's help he escapes from Spectreville aboard a railway push-car with Seraffimo Spang in pursuit aboard an old Western train. Bond changes the points and re-routes the train onto <b>a</b> <b>dead-end,</b> and shoots Spang before the resulting crash. Assisted by Leiter, Bond and Tiffany go via California to New York, where they board the RMS Queen Elizabeth to travel to London, a relationship developing between them as they go. Wint and Kidd observe their embarkation and follow them on board. They kidnap Tiffany, planning to kill her and throw her overboard. Bond rescues her and kills both gangsters; he makes it look like a murder-suicide.|$|E

25|$|The {{station was}} built in 1912 and {{remained}} in operation until 1938 when financial distress caused the New York, Westchester & Boston Railway to shut down.
