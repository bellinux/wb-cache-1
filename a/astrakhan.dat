5|$|Kork married Yekaterina Mikhailovna (born 1894). In June 1937, after Kork's arrest, Yekaterina was exiled to <b>Astrakhan,</b> {{where she}} was arrested on 5 September. She and other wives of {{executed}} military leaders were moved back to Moscow and subjected to torture and interrogation. On 13 July 1941 she {{was sentenced to death}} and was shot at the Kommunarka on 28 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} Russian merchants within Shamakhi were {{subsequently}} {{used as a}} casus belli for the Russo-Persian War of 1722–1723, leading to the cessation of trade between Iran and Russia and the designation of <b>Astrakhan</b> as the new terminus on the Volga trade route.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1960s, {{populations of}} the Caucasian jungle cat living along the Caspian Sea and in the Caucasus range states have been rapidly declining. Only small populations persist today. There has been no record in the <b>Astrakhan</b> Nature Reserve in the Volga Delta since the 1980s. The jungle cat is rare in the Middle East. In Jordan, it is highly {{affected}} by the expansion of agricultural areas around the river beds of Yarmouk and Jordan rivers, where farmers hunted and poisoned jungle cats for attacking poultry. It is also considered rare and threatened in Afghanistan. India exported jungle cat skins in large numbers, until this was banned in 1979; some illegal trade, however, continues in the country, {{as well as in}} Egypt and Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|The Z-3 {{was to be}} a {{reconnaissance}} {{version and}} would have had additional fuel tanks, increasing its range to 6,000km (3,730mi). Production was due to take place in 1944, just as bomber production was being abandoned. The long-range variants failed to come to fruition. The He 111Z was to have been used in an invasion of Malta in 1942 and as part of an airborne assault on the Soviet cities of <b>Astrakhan</b> and Baku in the Caucasus in the same year. During the Battle of Stalingrad their use was cancelled due to insufficient airfield capacity. Later in 1943, He111Zs helped evacuate German equipment and personnel from the Caucasus region, and during the Allied invasion of Sicily, attempted to deliver reinforcements to the island.|$|E
5|$|Although wolves {{primarily}} feed {{on medium}} to large sized ungulates, {{they are not}} fussy eaters. Smaller sized animals that may supplement the diet of wolves include marmots, hares, badgers, foxes, weasels, ground squirrels, mice, hamsters, voles and other rodents, as well as insectivores. They frequently eat waterfowl and their eggs. When such foods are insufficient, they prey on lizards, snakes, frogs, rarely toads and large insects as available. In times of scarcity, wolves readily eat carrion, visiting cattle burial grounds and slaughter houses. Cannibalism is not uncommon in wolves: during harsh winters, packs often attack weak or injured wolves, and may eat the bodies of dead pack members. Wolf packs in <b>Astrakhan</b> hunt Caspian seals on the Caspian Sea coastline and some wolf packs in Alaska and Western Canada have been observed to feed on salmon. Humans are rarely, but occasionally preyed upon. Other primates occasionally taken by wolves include grey langurs in Nepal and hamadryas baboons in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1940, {{following}} the rising tension between the Soviet Union and Germany over territories in the Balkans, an eventual invasion of the Soviet Union seemed to Hitler {{to be the only}} solution. While no concrete plans were made yet, Hitler told one of his generals in June that the victories in Western Europe finally freed his hands for his important real task: the showdown with Bolshevism. With the successful end to the campaign in France, General Erich Marcks was assigned to the working group drawing up the initial invasion plans of the Soviet Union. The first battle plans were entitled Operation Draft East (but colloquially it was known as the Marcks Plan). His report advocated the A-A line to be the operational objective of any invasion of the Soviet Union. This goal would extend from northern city of Arkhangelsk on the Arctic Sea through Gorky and Rostov to the port city of <b>Astrakhan</b> {{at the mouth of the}} Volga on the Caspian Sea. The report concluded that this military border would reduce the threat to Germany (and the Third Reich) from attacks by enemy bombers.|$|E
5|$|Through its {{absorption}} of the principalities of Novgorod (1478) and Pskov (1510), the Tsardom of Russia had become Livonia's eastern neighbour and grown stronger after annexing the khanates of Kazan (1552) and <b>Astrakhan</b> (1556). The conflict between Russia and the Western powers was exacerbated by Russia's isolation from sea trade. The new Ivangorod port built by Tsar Ivan {{on the eastern}} shore of the Narva River in 1550 was considered unsatisfactory on account of its shallow waters. Thereafter the tsar demanded that the Livonian Confederation pay about 6,000 marks to keep the Bishopric of Dorpat, based on the claim that every adult male had paid Pskov one mark when it had been an independent state. The Livonians eventually promised to pay this sum to Ivan by 1557, but were sent from Moscow when they failed to do so, ending negotiations. Ivan continued {{to point out that the}} existence of the Order required passive Russian support, and was quick to threaten use of military force if necessary. He aimed to establish a corridor between the Baltic and the new territories on the Caspian Sea, because if Russia were to engage in open conflict with major western powers, it would need imports of more sophisticated weaponry.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Astrakhan</b> Tatars (around 80,000) are a {{group of}} Tatars, {{descendants}} of the <b>Astrakhan</b> Khanate's nomadic population, who live mostly in <b>Astrakhan</b> Oblast. For the Russian census in 2010, most <b>Astrakhan</b> Tatars declared themselves simply as Tatars and few declared themselves as <b>Astrakhan</b> Tatars. A large number of Volga Tatars live in <b>Astrakhan</b> Oblast and differences between them have been disappearing.|$|E
25|$|Tutarinov {{was born}} on 19 June 1904 {{in the village of}} Krasny Yar in <b>Astrakhan</b> Governorate. He was an <b>Astrakhan</b> Cossack. Before joining the Red Army in September 1923, Tutarinov worked in the local Cheka, the local Politburo, the Fisheries Trust and the Komsomol {{district}} committees.|$|E
25|$|<b>Astrakhan</b> in Russia has {{historically}} been a trading centre for Indian merchants since the 16th century. In 1722 Peter the Great met with Anbu-Ram {{the leader of the}} Indians merchants in <b>Astrakhan.</b> In the meeting Peter the Great agreed to Anbu-Ram's request for full free trade including transit rights.|$|E

25|$|Emelianenko faced Magomed Malikov at M-1 Challenge XXVIII on November 12, 2011 in <b>Astrakhan,</b> Russia. Emelianenko {{lost the}} fight via first-round KO.|$|E
25|$|Rusiyyah {{was used}} by Ahmad ibn Fadlan for Varangians near <b>Astrakhan,</b> and by the Persian {{traveler}} Ahmad ibn Rustah who visited Veliky Novgorod and described how the Rus' exploited the Slavs.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the Tatar population are Volga Tatars, native to the Volga region, and the Crimean Tatars of Crimea. There are smaller groups of Lipka Tatars and <b>Astrakhan</b> Tatars in Europe and the Siberian Tatars in Asia.|$|E
25|$|Nikolai Nikolaevich Baskakov {{was born}} May 8, 1918 {{in a village}} seven {{kilometers}} from the <b>Astrakhan</b> city on the Volga River. His father, Nikolai Evlampievich Baskakov was a carpenter, his mother Evdokiya Vasilievna was a housewife raising children their children- nine sons and two daughters.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} Tatar dialects: Eastern, Central, Western. The Western dialect (Misher) is spoken mostly by Mishärs, the Central dialect is spoken by Kazan and <b>Astrakhan</b> Tatars, and the Eastern (Sibir) dialect is spoken by Siberian Tatars in western Siberia. All three dialects have subdialects. Central Tatar is {{the base of}} {{literary}} Tatar.|$|E
25|$|The fertile {{river valley}} {{provides}} {{large quantities of}} wheat, and also has many mineral riches. A substantial petroleum industry centers on the Volga valley. Other resources include natural gas, salt, and potash. The Volga Delta and the nearby Caspian Sea offer superb fishing grounds. <b>Astrakhan,</b> at the delta, {{is the center of}} the caviar industry.|$|E
25|$|On 26 July 1918, a coup d'état overthrew the Bolsheviks in Baku. The new body, the Central Caspian Dictatorship, {{wanted to}} arrest Stepan Shahumian, {{but he and}} his 1,200 Red Army troops seized the local arsenal and 13 ships, and began heading to <b>Astrakhan.</b> The Caspian fleet, loyal to the new government, turned them back.|$|E
25|$|When {{they reached}} <b>Astrakhan,</b> Öz Beg Khan had just given {{permission}} {{for one of}} his pregnant wives, Princess Bayalun, a daughter of Byzantine emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos, to return to her home city of Constantinople to give birth. Ibn Battuta talked his way into this expedition, which would be his first beyond the boundaries of the Islamic world.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} {{was formed by}} an order of the 11th Army dated 20 March 1919 from units of the 1st Rifle Division of the 12th Army, which had been formed in October 1918 as the <b>Astrakhan</b> Rifle Division. The division participated {{in the defense of}} <b>Astrakhan</b> until May 1919. The 33rd became part of the 11th Army upon its formation and was commanded by Pavel Kuzmich Marmuzov. In May, Mikhail Lewandowski took command of the division. Between May and June, the division fought in defensive battles for control of the Donbass. In June, the division became part of the 8th Army. After the Donbass fighting, White Army commander Anton Denikin ordered an attack on Moscow in the Moscow Directive. Initially successful, the White offensive forced the 8th Army, including the 33rd, and other Red units to retreat, but was stopped by Bolshevik resistance by the beginning of August.|$|E
25|$|During {{his long}} reign, Ivan the Terrible nearly doubled the already large Russian {{territory}} by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of the disintegrated Golden Horde): Kazan and <b>Astrakhan</b> along the Volga River, and the Siberian Khanate in southwestern Siberia. Thus, {{by the end}} of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a multiethnic, multidenominational and transcontinental state.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time the lands to the east of the Volga River (Taw yağı) were ceded to Russia. Ütämeşgäräy, along with his mother, was sent to a Moscow prison. Şahğäli {{occupied}} the Kazan throne until February 1552. Anti-Moscow elements in the Kazan government exiled Şahğäli and invited the <b>Astrakhan</b> prince Yadegar Moxammad, along with the Nogays, to aid them.|$|E
25|$|Specifically, it {{was used}} as a title by and today signifies a patriarchal lineage to the various Persian Empires, Turkish Ottoman Empire, the Shirvanshahs and Circassians of the Caucasus, Mughals / Moguls or Muslim Rajputs of the Indian Subcontinent. It was also a title {{bestowed}} upon members of the highest aristocracies in Tatar states, such as the Khanates of Kazan and <b>Astrakhan.</b>|$|E
25|$|The modern Indian {{merchant}} diaspora in Central Asia and Arabia {{emerged in}} the mid-16th century and remained active for over four centuries. <b>Astrakhan</b> {{at the mouth of}} the Volga was the first place in the Tsardom of Russia where an Indian merchant colony was established as early as the 1610s. Russian chroniclers reported the presence of Hindu traders in Moscow and St Petersburg in the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Peter {{implemented}} sweeping reforms {{aimed at}} modernizing Russia. Heavily influenced by his advisors from Western Europe, Peter reorganized the Russian army along modern lines {{and dreamed of}} making Russia a maritime power. He faced much opposition to these policies at home but brutally suppressed rebellions against his authority, including by the Streltsy, Bashkirs, <b>Astrakhan,</b> and the greatest civil uprising of his reign, the Bulavin Rebellion.|$|E
25|$|It {{comprised}} the Republic of Adygeya, the Republic of Dagestan, the Republic of Ingushetia, the Kabardino-Balkar Republic, the Republic of Kalmykia, the Karachay–Cherkess Republic, the Republic of North Osetia-Alaniya, the Chechen Republic, Krasnodar Krai, Stavropol Krai, and <b>Astrakhan,</b> Volgograd, and Rostov oblasts. It {{has the same}} borders as the Southern Federal District. Its last commander was Lieutenant General Alexander Galkin, appointed from January 2010.|$|E
25|$|In 1259, Hordes tax-collectors and census-takers {{arrived in}} the city, leading to {{political}} disturbances and forcing Alexander Nevsky to punish a number of town officials (he cut off their noses) for defying him as Grand Prince of Vladimir (soon to be the khan's tax-collector in Russia) and his Mongol overlords. In the 14th century, raids by Novgorod pirates, or ushkuiniki, sowed fear as far as Kazan and <b>Astrakhan,</b> assisting Novgorod in wars with the Grand Duchy of Moscow.|$|E
25|$|In 1521, Kazan {{emerged from}} the {{dominance}} of Moscow, concluding a mutual aid treaty with the <b>Astrakhan</b> Khanate, the Crimean Khanate and the Nogay Horde. The combined forces of khan Muhamed Giray and his Crimean allies then attacked Muscovy and captured more than 150,000 slaves. Russian chronicles record about forty attacks by Kazan khans on the Russian territories (mainly the regions of Nizhniy Novgorod, Murom, Vyatka, Vladimir, Kostroma, and Galich) {{in the first half}} of the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|In {{the city}} of <b>Astrakhan,</b> strikers and Red Army {{soldiers}} who joined them were loaded onto barges and then thrown by the hundreds into the Volga with stones around their necks. Between 2,000 and 4,000 were shot or drowned between 12 and 14 March 1919. In addition, the repression also {{claimed the lives of}} some 600 to 1,000 of the bourgeoisie. Archival documents indicate this was the largest massacre of workers by the Bolsheviks before the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion.|$|E
25|$|Avia-Indra is annual {{military}} exercise {{conducted by the}} Air forces of India and Russia that is held in two parts. In 2014 {{the first part of}} the exercise was held in the <b>Astrakhan</b> region, close to the Caspian Sea in Russia and the second part was held in Halwara, Punjab in India. The objective of the exercise is to improve operational interoperability between the respective Air forces and training. Aircraft involved in the exercise included Su-30MKIs, Su-30SMs, MiG-21s, Mi-17 & Mi-35 helicopters.|$|E
25|$|In 1718 Peter {{made him}} one of his six {{adjutant}} generals, and governor of <b>Astrakhan.</b> In this post Volynsky displayed distinguished administrative and financial talents. In 1722 he married Alexandra Naryshkina, Peter's cousin. The same year he was accused of peculation and other offences to the emperor, who caned him severely and deprived him of his plenipotentiary powers, despite his undeniable services in Persia, but for which Peter could never have emerged so triumphantly from the difficult Persian war of 1722-1723.|$|E
25|$|A unified Rus conquered Khanate of Kazan in 1552, <b>Astrakhan</b> Khanate in 1556, Siberia Khanate in 1582. The Crimean Tatars wreaked {{havoc in}} {{southern}} Russia, Ukraine and even Poland {{in the course}} of the 16th and early 17th centuries, but they were not able to defeat Russia or take Moscow. Under Ottoman protection, the Khanate of Crimea continued its precarious existence until Catherine the Great annexed it on April 8, 1783. It was by far the longest-lived of the successor states to the Golden Horde.|$|E
25|$|The {{variation}} of deposition {{is due to}} the long period over which the Karachaganak structure was formed. From the Late Devonian to the middle Carboniferous the field was an atoll, over which in the early Permian a system of reefs were built. At its greatest the reservoir is 1.5km thick. This type of reservoir structure has been seen in analogous fileds including Kenkiyak, Zhanazhol, Tengiz, and possibly <b>Astrakhan</b> fields. A west-east cross section through Karachaganak resembles the twin humps of a camel, indicating two separate reef highs.|$|E
25|$|Further east, the Axis enjoyed greater {{success and}} on 1 September, the Germans took Khulkhuta (Хулхута́), halfway between Elista and <b>Astrakhan.</b> During August and September, German patrols raided the railway between Kizlyar, {{north-east}} of Grozny, marking the farthest {{advance of the}} German forces towards the Caspian Sea. In the south, the First Panzer Army advance on Grozny was stopped by the Red Army and the 14th Air Army. By late September, supply failures and {{the resistance of the}} Red Army slowed the Axis advance.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-16th {{century the}} Tsardom of Russia conquered the Tatar khanates of Kazan and <b>Astrakhan,</b> thus annexing the entire Volga Region and opening {{the way to}} the Ural Mountains. The {{colonization}} of the new easternmost lands of Russia and further onslaught eastward was led by the rich merchants Stroganovs. Tsar Ivan IV granted vast estates near the Urals as well as tax privileges to Anikey Stroganov, who organized large scale migration to these lands. Stroganovs developed farming, hunting, saltworks, fishing, and ore mining on the Urals and established trade with Siberian tribes.|$|E
25|$|A {{revival of}} boar populations {{began in the}} middle of the 20th century. By 1950 wild boar had once again reached their {{original}} northern boundary in many parts of their Asiatic range. By 1960, they reached Leningrad and Moscow, and by 1975 they were to be found in Archangelsk and <b>Astrakhan.</b> In the 1970s they again occurred in Denmark and Sweden, where captive animals escaped and now survive in the wild. In England, wild boar populations re-established themselves in the 1990s, after escaping from specialist farms that had imported European stock.|$|E
