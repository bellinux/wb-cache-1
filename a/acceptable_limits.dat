5|$|When {{the power}} company's voltage becomes {{distorted}} due to harmonics, losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed AC motors are increased. This condition {{may lead to}} overheating and shorter operating life. Also, substation transformers and compensation capacitors are affected negatively. In particular, capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels. In order to limit the voltage distortion, owners of VFD load {{may be required to}} install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below <b>acceptable</b> <b>limits.</b> Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In high-power installations, harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase-shifted windings.|$|E
5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within <b>acceptable</b> <b>limits.</b> Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E

Surface water samples were collected between May and September, at 9 high-use sites from 2003 to 2007.

40|$|Abstract [...] Maintaining the {{availability}} of a system {{is one of the most}} critical and challenging tasks for industries during production. For maintaining {{the availability}} of the system, it is essential to maintain the reliability and maintainability of its subsystems. Components or subsystems in the system fail due to variety of reasons. Certain components in the system fail only due to severe vibration occurring in it. The <b>acceptable</b> <b>limit</b> of vibration velocity corresponds to the design value beyond that the component will fail. However, under normal operating conditions, most of the components will not fail just beyond the <b>acceptable</b> <b>limit</b> of vibration velocity. But if the velocity of vibration increases, beyond the <b>acceptable</b> <b>limit,</b> the failure rate also increases. The objective of this paper is to relate {{the availability of}} the system with mechanical vibration which causes the failure of certain subsystems. The developed equations are used to study the effect of mechanical vibration occurring in certain machines on plant availability, before and after the modification, in a typical industrial plant. Keywords [...] availability, failure constant, maximum value of vibration velocity, MTBF, MTTR, reliability I...|$|R
25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside the}} first stage can be of the diaphragm type or the piston type. Both types can be balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced regulators have the cylinder pressure pushing {{the first stage}} upstream valve closed, which is opposed by the intermediate stage pressure and a spring. As cylinder pressure falls the closing force is less, so the regulated pressure increases at lower tank pressure. To keep this pressure rise within <b>acceptable</b> <b>limits</b> the high-pressure orifice size is limited, but this decreases the total flow capacity of the regulator. A balanced regulator keeps about the same ease of breathing at all depths and pressures, by using the cylinder pressure to also indirectly oppose {{the opening of the}} first stage valve.|$|E
25|$|Most reactor designs rely on liquid {{hydrogen}} {{as both a}} coolant and a method for converting stray neutrons from the reaction into tritium, which is fed back into the reactor as fuel. Hydrogen is highly flammable, {{and in the case}} of a fire it is possible that the hydrogen stored on-site could be burned up and escape. In this case, the tritium contents of the hydrogen would be released into the atmosphere, posing a radiation risk. Calculations suggest that at about , the total amount of tritium and other radioactive gases in a typical power station would be so small that they would have diluted to legally <b>acceptable</b> <b>limits</b> by the time they blew as far as the station's perimeter fence.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{stored in}} {{capacitive}} or inductive {{elements of the}} network give rise to reactive power flow. Reactive power flow strongly influences the voltage levels across the network. Voltage levels and reactive power flow must be carefully controlled to allow a power system to be operated within <b>acceptable</b> <b>limits.</b> A technique known as reactive compensation is used to reduce apparent power flow to a load by reducing reactive power supplied from transmission lines and providing it locally. For example, to compensate an inductive load a shunt capacitor is installed close to the load itself. This allows all reactive power needed by the load to be supplied by the capacitor {{and not have to}} be transferred over the transmission lines. This practice alone does not save energy in a direct way, because reactive power does no work. But because the reactive component of the current is now only flowing locally, it is producing heat only in the local conductors and thus saving total energy.|$|E

In this paper, we propose anefficient data reporting protocol (EDRP) which filters the redundant data and thereby reduces the energy consumption of sensor nodes (SNs). EDRP can be tuned according to the application requirements. Simulation results show that significant energy is saved by our proposed scheme. Effect of two parameters (<b>acceptable</b> <b>limit</b> and Check) used by EDRP has also been analyzed.

Approximately 40 % of boreholes had total iron concentration exceeding 1000 µg l- 1 (maximum WHO permissible limit). Aluminium concentration varied from 0. 1 µg l- 1 to 2510 µg l- 1 with a median value of 10. 0 µg l- 1. Approximately 20 % of the boreholes had aluminium concentration exceeding the WHO maximum <b>acceptable</b> <b>limit</b> (200 µg l- 1) for drinking water. Manganese concentration was in the range 6 – 2510 µg l- 1 with a median of 356 µg l- 1.

25|$|The {{technical}} feasibility of deepwater floating wind turbines is not questioned, as the long-term survivability of floating structures {{has been successfully}} demonstrated by the marine and offshore oil industries over many decades. However, the economics that allowed the deployment of thousands of offshore oil rigs {{have yet to be}} demonstrated for floating wind turbine platforms. For deepwater wind turbines, a floating structure will replace pile-driven monopoles or conventional concrete bases that are commonly used as foundations for shallow water and land-based turbines. The floating structure must provide enough buoyancy to support the weight of the turbine and to restrain pitch, roll and heave motions within <b>acceptable</b> <b>limits.</b> The capital costs for the wind turbine itself will not be significantly higher than current marine-proofed turbine costs in shallow water. Therefore, the economics of deepwater wind turbines will be determined primarily by the additional costs of the floating structure and power distribution system, which are offset by higher offshore winds and close proximity to large load centres (e.g. shorter transmission runs).|$|E
