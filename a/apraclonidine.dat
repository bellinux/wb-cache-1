50|$|<b>Apraclonidine</b> may {{be useful}} in the {{diagnosis}} of Horner's syndrome. In Horner's syndrome, the sympathetic innervation to the pupillary dilator muscle is lost.

When applied to the denervated (and thus hyper-sensitive) pupillary dilator muscle, a super-normal dilatory response is generated in which the pupil dilates to a degree greater than that which would be seen in a non-denervated muscle. This causes the reversal of anisocoria that is characteristic of Horner's.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Because of denervation supersensitivity, a miotic pupil in a sympathetically-denervated eye dilates in {{response}} to a dilute or weak alpha- 1 -agonist drug. A reversal of anisocoria after topical <b>apraclonidine</b> is considered as a positive test result that diagnoses a unilateral Horner syndrome. HISTORY AND SIGNS: Two women aged 34 and 46 years with a cocaine-confirmed oculosympathetic defect (Horner syndrome) were tested with 1 % topical <b>apraclonidine</b> on separate days. THERAPY AND OUTCOME: In one patient, her miotic Horner pupil dilated marginally but not enough to reverse the baseline anisocoria. Additionally, the upper lid on the same side retracted. There was no discernable effect of <b>apraclonidine</b> on the normal, contralateral eye. In the second patient, there was no pupillary response to <b>apraclonidine</b> but there was resolution of her ptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Neither patient demonstrated a reversal of anisocoria, the current criterion for diagnosing a Horner syndrome using <b>apraclonidine.</b> Thus, these two patients with an established oculosympathetic defect were said to have a "negative test" for Horner syndrome. Yet both women showed subtle pupil and/or lid changes {{in response}} to <b>apraclonidine</b> that were consistent with sympathetic denervation supersensitivity.

40|$|Objective and Background: Pupillometric {{investigations}} into migraine {{have suggested that}} an autonomic disturbance {{is part of the}} pathogenesis of that condition. This observation is controversial, however, which may reflect that the putative sympathetic hypofunction is either subtle or transient. In this study, we assessed the sympathetic function of migraine patients and controls during both a symptom-free phase and a migraine attack, and challenged patients with <b>apraclonidine</b> to reveal small changes in autonomic function. Methods: Infrared pupillometry was used to measure pupillometric parameters in 37 controls and 46 migraine patients in the interictal phase of disease. Fifteen migraine patients were also studied during a migraine attack. In addition, 26 controls and 18 migraine patients were tested interictally both with and without <b>apraclonidine.</b> Of these 18 migraine patients, seven were also tested with and without <b>apraclonidine</b> during a migraine attack. Results: We found no significant differences between migraine patients and controls in the interictal phase. Additionally, no differences in pupil parameters were detected during the migraine attack. However, after administration of <b>apraclonidine,</b> migraine patients had a longer latency of the light reflex compared with controls.

40|$|Introduction. Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) is an intraocular {{pressure}} lowering method that is overall safe and powerful, but often complicated by transient postoperative {{intraocular pressure}} rises. In prevention of this complication, we frequently use two potent alpha-adrenergic agonists - brimonidine and <b>apraclonidine.</b> Objective. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare brimonidine 0. 2 % and <b>apraclonidine</b> 0. 5 % efficacy and safety in prevention of intraocular pressure elevation after ALT. Methods. This was a prospective, randomized, double-masked and comparative study. This study included 27 POAG patients, 15 received 0. 2 % brimonidine, and 12 received 0. 5 % <b>apraclonidine</b> before laser surgery (22 eyes in both groups). Intraocular pressure readings were taken 1, 2, 3, 24 hours and 7 days after ALT. Student’s t-test was used to analyze data between two groups, and χ 2 test to compare data within groups.

Methods: A total of 22 diabetic patients were recruited. Baseline pupillary diameter (PD) and the difference in PD between the test eye and the control eye before and after instillation of <b>apraclonidine</b> and pilocarpine were measured. All patients also underwent cardiovascular autonomic function (CAF) testing. Results: Baseline PD in room light correlated with duration of diabetes mellitus (DM, p= 0. 049) {{and the presence of}} DM retinopathy (DMR, p= 0. 022). Eleven patients (50 %) had positive <b>apraclonidine</b> tests, and two patients had positive pilocarpine tests.

Ten adult beagles were used. Baseline values were measured at 8 a. m., 2 p. m. and 8 p. m., for three consecutive days. A waiting period of 10 days between the administrations of each drug was established. For 15 consecutive days, the drug being tested was instilled in one eye of each dog twice a day (7 a. m. and 7 p. m.). The parameters were evaluated at the aforementioned times on days 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15. Data were statistically compared using the Bonferroni test and one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (P< 0. 05). The Pearson test was used to evaluate any correlation between QT interval, HR and BP. The tested drugs did not find a decrease in IOP. A significant decreased in PS was observed in almost all dogs following levobunolol administration, relative to the control eye. A significant decrease in HR was observed on day 3 following levobunolol treatment, while <b>apraclonidine</b> induced an increase on day 15. Blood pressure was reduced in all measurement time points following <b>apraclonidine</b> treatment. A negative correlation between QT interval and HR was only observed in dogs treated with timolol. In conclusion, levobunolol was the only drug that induced significant alterations in PS. <b>Apraclonidine</b> was the only drug that induced systemic hypotension. Timolol was the only drug to that induced a negative correlation between QT and HR...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. TO {{determine}} whether chronic topical glaucoma therapy can control intraocular pressure (IOP) and protect nerve fibers in a rat model of pressure-induced optic nerve damage. METHODS. Sixteen adult Brown Norway rats were administered unilateral episcleral vein injections of hypertonic saline to produce scarring of the aqueous humor outflow pathways. Twice daily applications of either artificial tears (n — 6), 0. 5 % betaxolol (n = 5), or 0. 5 % <b>apraclonidine</b> (n = 5) were delivered to both eyes, and awake pressures were monitored with a TonoPen XL tonometer for 17 {{days before the}} rats were killed. RESULTS. For animals administered artificial tears, the mean IOP of the experimental eyes was 39 ± 2 mm Hg compared with 29 ± 1 mm Hg for the control eyes. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 001). Mean IOPs in the experimental eyes of animals administered betaxolol and <b>apraclonidine</b> were 29 ± 7 and 29 ± 4 mm Hg, respectively, whereas the mean IOP in the control eyes was 28 ± 1 mm Hg for both groups. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} among these values. The mean IOP for the experimental eyes in the betaxolol and <b>apraclonidine</b> groups was lower than that in animals administered artificial tears (P = 0. 003). Quantitative histologic analysis of optic nerve damage in experimental eyes showed that four of the six animals administere...|$|E
40|$|A prospective, {{randomized}} {{double-blind study}} {{has been carried out}} to verify the acute effects of -adrenoreceptor agonist eyedrops administration on visual field parameters and ocular perfusion pressure in patients affected by primary open-angle glaucoma. Thirty-two glaucomatous subjects (64 eyes) were enrolled in the clinical trial and subsequently randomized into four study groups to compare the systemic and ocular effects of placebo, clonidine 0. 125 %, <b>apraclonidine</b> 1. 0 % and brimonidine 0. 2 %. No significant variations in the ocular or systemic parameters were observed after placebo administration. All the -adrenoreceptor agonist compounds induced a significant reduction of the intraocular pressure (p< 0. 01). Only the acute administration of clonidine 0. 125 % resulted in a decrease in ocular perfusion pressure (p< 0. 001). Both clonidine 0. 125 % and <b>apraclonidine</b> 1. 0 % caused a significant worsening of visual field parameters. On the contrary, topical brimonidine 0. 2 % did not induce any significant visual field modification, suggesting that its acute administration does not affect the blood flow or vasomotor activity {{at the level of the}} posterior pole...|$|E
