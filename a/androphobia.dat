50|$|Taro Sado is a masochist {{and goes}} to a high school with his male friend Tatsukichi Hayama.

5000|$|Mahiru is a timid, 17 year-old {{girl who}} works at Wagnaria. She has <b>androphobia</b> and is thus terrified of men; she punches any male that comes near her. This violent {{behavior}} was revealed to have arisen from childhood, when her father, {{who did not want}} his daughter to eventually marry, told her that every man is ready to attack her and conditioned her to violently attack men at a moment's notice due to this fear. As she and Sōta usually share shifts, he takes the brunt of her attacks. However, she makes considerable progress with her fear of men by taking it out on Sōta. She wears a hairpin in her hair, which she changes every day after Sōta complimented it (according to Sōma).|$|E
5000|$|Name unspecified, {{loves his}} {{daughter}} {{to the point of}} making up lies about males so that no boys would come near her. Out of jealousy, he told Mahiru that all men wanted to attack her so that she would fear them and never get married. He is the cause of Mahiru's <b>androphobia</b> and abnormal strength, having subtly trained her from birth, though this has also made him a target for her punching. Due to the possibility of getting hit at home, he lives and works by himself faraway, almost forgetting what Mahiru looks like. He appears to be calm and normal, but carries a rifle with him which he intends to use on boys who get too close to Mahiru.|$|E
50|$|Other {{concepts}} explored are postmodernism {{and political}} correctness; and he use {{the example of}} militant feminism to demonstrate how dogmatic adherence to any belief system can result in intolerant and even dangerous ideologies, suggesting that dogmatic and extreme feminism has made <b>androphobia</b> acceptable (he uses the term 'androphobia' {{in reference to the}} fear/hatred of all men on ideological grounds, rather than in the psychological sense). Although this argument could be construed by some as sexist, it is made clear that he is in agreement with the basic aims of traditional and mainstream feminism (i.e. the equality of women and men) and he only opposes the most extreme strains of feminism, and he also states that he is in agreement with many of the goals of political correctness, yet opposes the ‘fascist’ tactics used by some of its adherents to force its ideals on people.|$|E
5000|$|Fukuyama is {{a classmate}} of Yukinari Sasaki and Kirie Kojima. Fukuyama is rich, powerful, and perverted, {{and while he}} often chases girls and insults Yukinari by calling him [...] "Puny-Nari" [...] (Chibi-nari), he does show a serious, caring side in {{critical}} situations. He suffers <b>androphobia</b> {{to the point that}} he has developed an allergy that causes him to break out with a rash whenever he comes into contact with another male. He often appears without the others noticing until he announces his presence, whereupon he either gropes or strips the girls of their clothing, which always earns him a severe beating from Kirie. Despite his own lecherous behavior, Fukuyama is highly protective of his younger sister, Lisa, and strongly objects to her affections for Yukinari. Fukuyama is voiced by Ryōtarō Okiayu in Japanese and by Liam O'Brien in English, of which O'Brien received a nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy at the American Anime Awards. Shin-ichiro Miki provides Fukuyama's voice for the Drama CDs.|$|E
