2500|$|Series fansite Llanview Labyrinth {{remarks that}} {{although}} Gillian Spencer's Victoria is featured at the show's outset, [...] "the obviousness of Viki being the shows unquestioned 'lead' did not smack the viewer quite <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> later would ," [...] with Spencer's Victoria melding into the ensemble cast. Joanne Dorian briefly {{stepped into the}} role beginning in October 1970, with a markedly less dynamic presence on the series than her predecessor.|$|E
2500|$|The song offers {{listeners}} {{something similar}} to that of Queen's earlier hit [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] with its complex harmonies and guitar solos; however instead of mimicking an English choir, the band turned to a gospel choir. It reached #2 in the UK and #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US. This song made it clear to fans that [...] "Queen could swing <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> could rock, by channeling the spirit of gospel music." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad to {{hear you}} say so," [...] Gombauld broke in warmly. [...] "Lots of life: that's what we want. I like pullulation; {{everything}} ought to increase and multiply <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are {{hundreds}} ruined, and whole crops destroyed," [...] she said. [...] "Perhaps {{the men who}} sowed them worked <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> Charley. <b>It</b> would be dreadful {{if it came to}} us." ...|$|R
60|$|Claus now became {{impatient}} {{to complete his}} new dolly, and {{instead of waiting for}} the next day's sun he placed the clay image upon his hearth and covered it over with glowing coals. By morning, when he drew the dolly from the ashes, <b>it</b> had baked <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> if <b>it</b> had lain a full day in the hot sun.|$|R
6000|$|... "So it may," [...] said Waller; [...] "if <b>it</b> goes <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> wi' Gibault <b>as</b> <b>it</b> did wi' my old comrade, Bob Swan, it'll be no fun, I guess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I am {{worse than}} she is, because I've been driving. It's all up with Bernard and Mr. Green {{for the next}} week at least. It is {{freezing}} <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> can freeze, and they might as well try to hunt in Lapland as here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Philip Barry {{will come}} back from his voyage another man," [...] the doctor {{deliberately}} promised. [...] "And the separation will not be <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> now seems. After the fight for your husband's life and reason you may feel that {{we are about to}} conquer. Tahiti--the isle of rest--will restore him wholly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither can I! This trouble has hit you <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> has me. But, Dave, we've still our duty. To endure, to endure--that is our life. Because {{a beam of}} {{sunshine}} brightened, for a brief time, the gray of our lives, and then faded away, we must not shirk nor grow sour and discontented." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> you can," [...] said O'Hara to Trevor, as {{they faced}} one another, [...] "and hit <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> you like. <b>It</b> won't be any {{practice}} if you don't. I sha'n't mind being hit. It'll do me good for Aldershot. See?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, lads, we must retreat," [...] the {{lieutenant}} said. [...] "We have done very well. Now, across the village, {{and then make}} for the forest <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> you can. <b>It's</b> not over five hundred yards. When you are once there, make a stand again." ...|$|R
6000|$|JOHNNY. All right, my lad, all right. Sling your mud <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> you please: <b>it</b> wont {{stick to}} me. What I {{want to know}} is this. How is it that your father, who I suppose is the strongest man England has {{produced}} in our time-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It felt {{to me as}} if {{she struck}} all over,” Stephen said, “and I should think she is on a flat ledge of rock. I don’t think that the wind is blowing <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was when we lay down. There are some stars shining. At any rate we may as well go in again and wait. We should only be swept {{overboard}} if we tried to go forward.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's not blowing <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> {{was when}} we ran in, but I don't think dad would have gone unless he'd some {{particular}} reason," [...] Harry said at length. [...] "I wonder who the man is he expects to meet in Victoria, because I'm inclined to believe it's {{not the one who}} wants him to look at the land. The worst of dad is that he keeps such a lot to himself." ...|$|E
60|$|Some one {{was before}} them, however. The foolish dog {{had found a}} huge crab in the sand and, barking loudly, had pushed his muzzle against the creature, {{with the result that}} the crab seized his black nose in a {{gripping}} claw and pinched <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was able. Mumbles tried to back away, madly howling the while; but the crab, although the smaller antagonist, gripped a rock with its other claw and held on, anchoring the terrified dog to the spot.|$|E
5000|$|Ephraim Cabot - He is seventy-five, {{tall and}} gaunt, with great, wiry, {{concentrated}} power, but stoop-shouldered from toil. His face is <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> if <b>it</b> were hewn {{out of a}} boulder, {{yet there is a}} weakness in it, a petty pride in its own narrow strength. His eyes are small, close together, and extremely near-sighted, blinking continually in the effort to focus on objects, their stare having a straining, ingrowing quality. He is dressed in his dismal black Sunday suit.|$|R
50|$|Catalin is heavy, quite greasy in feel, and <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> brass. <b>It</b> is heat {{resistant}} {{and does not}} soften under boiling water. Like Bakelite, it gives off a distinctive phenolic odour when heated and can be tested using Simichrome, which turns from pink to yellow. Due to oxidation, older Catalin items darken in color; white discolors to yellow. This caused interesting effects in radio cabinets made from Catalin. Catalin radios were often made in stylish Art Deco designs and are sought after by collectors.|$|R
60|$|The {{spring of}} 1758 came; summer advanced. The {{builders}} assumed the offensive, and sent out skirmishers to the Rock, {{where they found}} that the enemy had taken little or no rest during the winter, and were <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> at <b>it</b> <b>as</b> ever. Little damage, however, had been done.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{expect the}} blue gap {{is the head}} of the valley," [...] he remarked and when Peter nodded resumed: [...] "We'll allow Stannard joined Jimmy ahead of the police and took him along. We have got to hit their line and this is not <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> looks. They can't steer for the {{shoulder}} of the big peak; the rocks won't go and I see an ugly ice-fall on the glacier. I reckon I'd head back, obliquely, for the col, up the long arrête." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was raining}} <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> not {{infrequently}} {{does in the}} mountain province, and the deluge lashed the sombre pines that towered above the dripping camp, when Brooke stood in {{the entrance of the}} Surveyor's tent. He was wet to the skin, as well as weary, for he had walked most of thirty miles that day over a very bad trail, and was but indifferently successful in his attempts to hide his anxiety. The Surveyor also noticed the grimness of his wet face, and dallied a moment with the card he held, for he had known what fatigue and short commons were in his early days.|$|E
60|$|It {{was raining}} when he awoke, and it rained {{for most of}} three days <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> often does on that coast, until the crystal depths of the Inlet grew turbid, and it flowed seaward between its {{dripping}} walls of mountains like a river. At last one afternoon the clouds were rolled away, and when fierce, glaring sunshine beat down Austerly {{decided that he would}} go ashore to fish. The men went with him, Valentine to pull the dory into the swollen river, Jimmy and Louis in the Siwash canoe to gather bark for fuel. When they approached the beach where they usually landed, Jimmy glanced thoughtfully at the great torn-up pines that went sliding by.|$|E
60|$|Lord Falworth had {{the grim}} {{strength}} of manhood's hard sense to upbear him in sending his son into the world, but the poor lady mother had nothing {{of that to}} uphold her. No doubt <b>it</b> was <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> then <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is now for the mother to see the nestling thrust from the nest to shift for itself. What tears were shed, what words of love were spoken to the only man-child, none but {{the mother and the}} son ever knew.|$|R
5000|$|Jia Jia {{reference}} to Chua's online handle {{did not get}} why he had to re-do the scenes so many times. He {{thought it was all}} his fault and started getting very frustrated, even though I could tell that he was really trying <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> he could. <b>It</b> was very painful for a mother to watch.|$|R
40|$|Dear Douglas: <b>It</b> has rained almost <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> today <b>as</b> <b>it</b> {{did on the}} day of your “Open House” but Dad and the Fishers and Mr. Dick got {{an early}} enough start before it began to rain so that they played nine holes of golf. It does Dad a lot of good to get out of doors and forget {{business}} for awhile. We thought of you often during the hot spell and wondered how you were standing it, particularly studying at night with your curtains drawn because of blackout regulations [...] ...|$|R
60|$|Still {{she would}} obey. Let the task be <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> might, she would obey. If he counselled {{her to do}} this or that, she would follow his counsel,--because she owed him so much. If she had {{accepted}} the half of all his wealth without loving him, she owed him the more on that account. But she knew,--she could not but know,--that her intellect was brighter than his; and might it not be possible for her to lead him? Then she made efforts to lead her husband, and {{found that he was}} as stiff-necked as an ox. Mr. Kennedy was not, perhaps, a clever man; but {{he was a man who}} knew his own way, and who intended to keep it.|$|E
60|$|Down the {{slanting}} road {{there was}} riding a big, burly man, {{clad in a}} tunic of purple velvet and driving a great black horse <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> could gallop. He leaned well over its neck as he rode, and made a heaving with his shoulders at every bound {{as though he were}} lifting the steed instead of it carrying him. In the rapid glance Alleyne saw that he had white doeskin gloves, a curling white feather in his flat velvet cap, and a broad gold, embroidered baldric across his bosom. Behind him rode six others, two and two, clad in sober brown jerkins, with the long yellow staves of their bows thrusting out from behind their right shoulders. Down the hill they thundered, over the brook and up {{to the scene of the}} contest.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's blowing about <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> can be," [...] he said, [...] "and {{she rolls}} fit {{to take the}} masts out of her. There don't seem no chance of the gale breaking, {{and none of the}} other ships of the fleet are in sight. That's about all I have to tell you, except that I told the captain that if he didn't get the hatches lifted a little we should be all stifled down here. He says if there's a bit of a lull he will ask them to give us a little fresh air, and in the mean time he says that any who are good sailors may go up on deck, but it will be at their own risk, for some of the seas go pretty nearly clean over her." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One {{major goal}} of Mathematical Knowledge Management is {{building}} extensive repositories, {{in which the}} mathematical knowledge has been verified. It appears, however, that maintaining such a repository is <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> building <b>it</b> – especially for an open collection {{with a large number}} of contributors. In this paper we argue that even careful reviewing of contributions cannot cope with the task of keeping a mathematical repository efficient and clearly arranged in the long term. We discuss reasons for revisions of mathematical repositories accomplished by the “core implementors ” and illustrate our experiences with revisions of MML, the Mizar Mathematical Library. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "College next," [...] said Tom, {{and he made}} a wry face, for {{studying}} was not particularly in his line, although he could knuckle down <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> anyone when <b>it</b> was necessary. But before they went to college the lads and their father, accompanied by some others, went off on a treasure hunt, locating what was known as the Stanhope fortune.|$|R
60|$|Yet try <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> I could <b>it</b> was {{impossible}} for me to discover what he really did mean. I was not conscious of having done him any injury, either bodily or otherwise. Indeed, of late I had hardly seen the man. The Widow Canby was not partial to dealings with him, and I never went near him on my own account.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't indeed!" [...] said Alice, {{in a great}} {{hurry to}} change the conversation, [...] "are you--are you--fond of--dogs?" [...] The mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: [...] "there is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh! such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, {{and all sorts of}} things--I ca'n't {{remember}} half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, and he says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!" [...] said Alice sadly, [...] "I'm afraid I've offended it again!" [...] for the mouse was swimming away from her <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I won't indeed!' said Alice, {{in a great}} {{hurry to}} change the subject of conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I can't {{remember}} half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming away from her <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.|$|E
6000|$|... "Presently," [...] {{she went}} on, very low, [...] "as I ran and ran, I heard behind me a loud crash--a sound as of a pistol-shot. That terrified me still more. I thought I was being pursued. Perhaps {{they took me}} for a burglar. In the agony of my terror, I rushed at the wall in mad haste, and climbed over it anyhow. In climbing, I tore my hand, as you see, and made myself bleed, oh, terribly! However, I persevered, and got down on the other side, with my clothes very little the worse for the scramble. And, fortunately, I was {{carrying}} a small light dust-cloak: I put it on at once, and it covered up everything. Then I began to walk along the road as fast as I could {{in the direction of}} the station. As I did so, a bicycle shot out from the gate in the opposite direction, going <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> could spin, simply flying towards Whittingham. Three minutes later, a man came up to me, breathless. It was the gardener at The Grange, I believe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm so glad! Now {{we shall}} have a Christmas like other people, and I'll never say again that rich folks don't {{remember}} poor folks. Come and show all our treasures to mother and the babies; they must have some," [...] answered Polly, feeling {{that the world was}} all right, and life not half <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> she thought <b>it</b> last night.|$|R
6000|$|... "In sooth, {{and it was}} Master Bletson {{who gave}} the first alarm," [...] replied the magistrate; [...] "or, at least, the first {{distinct}} one. You see, sir, I was in bed with my wife, and no one else; and I was as fast asleep as a man can desire to be at two hours after midnight, when, behold you, they came knocking at my bedroom door, to tell me there was an alarm in Woodstock, and that the bell of the Lodge was ringing at that dead hour of the night <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>it</b> rung when it called the court to dinner." ...|$|R
60|$|In a flash {{they were}} all {{down out of the}} treetops and dancing around old Granny Fox, cooling her off. Of course, Granny Fox kept right on running. She was too worried not to. But the Merry Little Breezes kept right beside her, and <b>it</b> was not nearly <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> running now <b>as</b> <b>it</b> had been.|$|R
