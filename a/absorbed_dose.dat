5|$|Contact {{with skin}} is dangerous, and {{adequate}} ventilation {{should be provided}} when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure by inhalation should not exceed 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium will readily absorb through the skin and care {{should be taken to}} avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> received by inhalation at the PEL. Thallium is a suspected human carcinogen. For a long time thallium compounds were readily available as rat poison. This fact and that it is water-soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.|$|E
5|$|Lithium fluoride, artificially {{grown as}} crystal, {{is clear and}} {{transparent}} and often used in specialist optics for IR, UV and VUV (vacuum UV) applications. It {{has one of the}} lowest refractive indexes and the furthest transmission range in the deep UV of most common materials. Finely divided lithium fluoride powder has been used for thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry (TLD): when a sample of such is exposed to radiation, it accumulates crystal defects which, when heated, resolve via a release of bluish light whose intensity is proportional to the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose,</b> thus allowing this to be quantified. Lithium fluoride is sometimes used in focal lenses of telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Without the {{protection}} of the Earth's atmosphere, cosmonauts were exposed to higher levels of radiation from a steady flux of cosmic rays and trapped protons from the South Atlantic Anomaly. The station's crews were exposed to an <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> of about 5.2cGy {{over the course of a}} 115-day expedition, producing an equivalent dose of 14.75cSv, or 1133µSv per day. This daily dose is approximately that received from natural background radiation on Earth in two years. The radiation environment of the station was not uniform; closer proximity to the station's hull led to an increased radiation dose, and the strength of radiation shielding varied between modules; Kvant-2's being better than the core module, for instance.|$|E

25|$|The most {{commonly}} used predictor of acute radiation symptoms is the whole-body <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose.</b> Several related quantities, such as the equivalent dose, effective dose, and committed dose, are used to gauge long-term stochastic biological effects such as cancer incidence, {{but they are not}} designed to evaluate acute radiation syndrome. To help avoid confusion between these quantities, <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> is measured in units of grays (in SI, unit symbol Gy) or rads (in CGS), while the others are measured in sieverts (in SI, unit symbol Sv) or rems (in CGS). 1rad = 0.01Gy and 1rem = 0.01Sv.|$|E
25|$|The gray (Gy), {{which has}} units of (joules/kilogram), is the SI unit of <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose,</b> {{and it is}} the amount of {{radiation}} required to deposit one joule of energy in one kilogram of any kind of matter.|$|E

40|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} that {{the extent of the}} risk from x-ray examination is related in some way to the radiation dose. As the dose increases, the likelihood of significant biological effects also increases. If a clear correlation between dose and effect is to be established, a convenient and reasonably accurate method of estimating patient’s <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> during common radiographic examinations will be highly needed. A simple method is developed in this project to determine the two important parameters e exposure at skin entrance (ESE) and half value layer (IIVL), which is essential to get reasonably accurate estimates of <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses.</b> Then, the patient’s <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> in common x-ray examinations can be estimated using the computer program.

30|$|The inter-group {{comparison}} {{showed that}} the mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> averaged over both gland types in the chewing-gum stimulation group were reduced by approximately 35 % (0.22  Gy/GBq) compared {{with those in the}} lemon-juice stimulation group; this observed difference was statistically significant (P[*]<[*] 0.001, Figure  4 a). The inter-group comparison, however, yielded {{no significant difference in the}} <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> between the chewing-gum stimulation and non-stimulation groups (P[*]=[*] 0.99, Figure  4 a). Separate inter-group comparisons for the parotid or submandibular glands exhibited a significant difference in the <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> between the chewing-gum and lemon-juice stimulation groups for both the submandibular (P[*]=[*] 0.04, Figure  4 b) and parotid glands (P[*]<[*] 0.001, Figure  4 c).|$|R
25|$|Low {{levels of}} gamma rays cause a {{stochastic}} health risk, which for radiation dose assessment {{is defined as}} the probability of cancer induction and genetic damage. High doses produce deterministic effects, which is the severity of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen. These effects are compared to the physical quantity <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> measured by the unit gray (Gy).|$|E
25|$|The {{radiation}} <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> is {{the amount}} energy absorbed per unit weight of the target material. Dose is used because, when the same substance is given the same dose, similar changes are observed in the target material. The SI unit for dose is grays (Gy or J/kg). Dosimeters are used to measure dose, and are small components that, when exposed to ionizing radiation, change measurable physical attributes {{to a degree that}} can be correlated to the dose received. Measuring dose (dosimetry) involves exposing one or more dosimeters along with the target material.|$|E
25|$|Formerly, {{units of}} {{measurement}} were the curie (Ci), being 3.7E10 Bq, and also 1.0 grams of Radium (Ra-226); the rad (radiation <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose),</b> now replaced by the gray; and the rem (Röntgen equivalent man), now replaced with the sievert. The rad and rem are essentially equivalent for almost all nuclear medicine procedures, and only alpha radiation will produce a higher Rem or Sv value, due to its much higher Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE). Alpha emitters are nowadays rarely used in nuclear medicine, but were used extensively {{before the advent of}} nuclear reactor and accelerator produced radionuclides. The concepts involved in radiation exposure to humans are covered by the field of Health Physics; the development and practice of safe and effective nuclear medicinal techniques is a key focus of Medical Physics.|$|E
30|$|Thirty {{patients}} {{diagnosed with}} neuroendocrine tumours undergoing therapy with 177 Lu-DOTATATE were included. Each patient underwent three SPECT/CT scans at 1, 4 and 7  days after the treatment. Three independent observers calculated <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> {{to the right}} and left kidney and the spleen using sVOI and one observer used aVOI. For tVOI, the <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> were calculated based on automatically drawn isocontours around the organs at different thresholds (42, 50, 60 and 70  %). The inter-observer difference between the calculated <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> for sVOI was calculated, and the differences between the three methods were computed. Ratios of organ volumes acquired at days 1, 4 and 7 versus the volume at day 1 were calculated for the tVOI method.|$|R

30|$|After {{applying}} 177 Lu-DOTA-PEG 5 k-Lys-BN {{at a low}} molar {{amount of}} peptide (0.3 [*]nmol) in a single <b>dose,</b> the <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> were calculated to be 0.36 [*]Gy/MBq for the murine kidney, 0.002 [*]Gy/MBq for the blood, 0.02 [*]Gy/MBq for the pancreas and 0.19 [*]Gy/MBq for the tumour. After the application of 177 Lu-DOTA-PEG 5 k-Lys-BN at a high amount of peptide (3.0 [*]nmol), however, the <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> to the murine kidney, blood, pancreas and tumour were calculated to be 0.50, 0.002, 0.006 and 0.11 [*]Gy/MBq, respectively. The estimate for an adult male resulted in <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> to the kidney, blood and pancreas of 9.4, 0.4 and 21.3 [*]Gy/GBq (0.3 [*]nmol) and 12.3, 0.4 and 5.2 [*]Gy/GBq (3.0 [*]nmol), respectively.|$|R
25|$|Both GCRs and SPEs are {{of concern}} for CNS risks. The major GCRs are {{composed}} of protons, α-particles, and particles of HZE nuclei with a broad energy spectra ranging from a few tens to above 10,000 MeV/u. In interplanetary space, GCR organ dose and dose-equivalent of more than 0.2 Gy or 0.6 Sv per year, respectively, are expected. The high energies of GCRs allow them to penetrate to hundreds of centimeters of any material, thus precluding radiation shielding as a plausible mitigation measure to GCR risks on the CNS. For SPEs, the possibility exists for an <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> of over 1 Gy from an SPE if crew members are in a thinly shielded spacecraft or performing a spacewalk. The energies of SPEs, although substantial (tens to hundreds of MeV), do not preclude radiation shielding as a potential countermeasure. However, the costs of shielding may be high {{to protect against the}} largest events.|$|E
25|$|To {{place the}} {{increased}} risk in perspective, a plain chest X-ray will expose {{a person to}} the same amount from background radiation that people are exposed to (depending upon location) every day over 10 days, while exposure from a dental X-ray is approximately equivalent to 1 day of environmental background radiation. Each such X-ray would add less than 1 per 1,000,000 to the lifetime cancer risk. An abdominal or chest CT would be the equivalent to 2–3 years of background radiation to the whole body, or 4–5 years to the abdomen or chest, increasing the lifetime cancer risk between 1 per 1,000 to 1 per 10,000. This is compared to the roughly 40% chance of a US citizen developing cancer during their lifetime. For instance, the effective dose to the torso from a CT scan of the chest is about 5 mSv, and the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> is about 14 mGy. A head CT scan (1.5mSv, 64mGy) that is performed once with and once without contrast agent, would be equivalent to 40 years of background radiation to the head. Accurate estimation of effective doses due to CT is difficult with the estimation uncertainty range of about ±19% to ±32% for adult head scans depending upon the method used.|$|E
2500|$|Radiotherapy {{treatments}} are typically prescribed {{in terms of}} the local <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose,</b> which might be 60Gy or higher. The dose is fractionated (about 2Gy per day for curative treatment), which allows for the normal tissues to undergo repair, allowing it to tolerate a higher dose than would otherwise be expected. [...] The dose to the targeted tissue mass must be averaged over the entire body mass, most of which receives negligible radiation, to arrive at a whole-body <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> that can be compared to the table above.|$|E

30|$|The Dnase 1 and Rnase 1 genes were {{strongly}} suppressed at the RNA level at all <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> and have, according to UniGene and The Human Protein Atlas, unknown gene expression and no protein expression in normal mouse and human thyroid tissue, respectively.

2500|$|... the {{advantage}} of phase contrast over conventional absorption contrast even grows with increasing energy. Furthermore, because the phase contrast image formation is not intrinsically linked to the absorption of X-rays in the sample, the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> can potentially be reduced by using higher X-ray energies.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> and dose {{equivalent}} from {{galactic cosmic rays}} and solar energetic particles on the Martian surface for ~300 days of observations during the current solar maximum was measured. These measurements are necessary for human missions {{to the surface of}} Mars, to provide microbial survival times of any possible extant or past life, and to determine how long potential organic biosignatures can be preserved. [...] This study estimates that a few meters drill is necessary to access possible biomolecules. [...] The actual <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> measured by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) is 76 mGy/yr at the surface. [...] Based on these measurements, for a round trip Mars surface mission with 180 days (each way) cruise, and 500 days on the Martian surface for this current solar cycle, an astronaut would be exposed to a total mission {{dose equivalent}} of ~1.01 sievert. Exposure to 1 sievert is associated with a 5 percent increase in risk for developing fatal cancer. NASA's current lifetime limit for increased risk for its astronauts operating in low-Earth orbit is 3 percent. Maximum shielding from galactic cosmic rays can be obtained with about 3 meters of Martian soil.|$|E
2500|$|Whereas {{the word}} cine (...) in general usage refers to cinema (that is, a movie) or to certain film formats (cine film) for {{recording}} such a movie, in medical usage {{it refers to}} cineradiography or, in recent decades, to any digital imaging mode that produces cine-like moving images (for example, newer CT and MRI systems can output to either cine mode or tile mode). Cineradiography records 30-frame-per-second fluoroscopic images of internal organs such as the heart taken during injection of contrast dye to better visualize regions of stenosis, or to record motility in the body's gastrointestinal tract. The predigital technology is being replaced with digital imaging systems. Some of these decrease the frame rate but also decrease the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> of radiation to the patient. As they improve, frame rates will likely increase.|$|E

In terms of radiation exposure, 148 MBq (4 mCi) of 124 I-IAZGP produced <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> to normal parenchymal tissues {{less than or equal}} to those produced by typical clinical activities (370 to 444 MBq; 10 to 12 mCi) of 18 F-FDG. However, the <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> to the large intestinal and urinary bladder walls were significantly greater for 124 I-IAZGP than 18 F-FDG.

30|$|In conclusion, {{these results}} {{demonstrate}} {{the complexity of}} radiation-induced biological effects. Thus, care should be taken when interpolating effects {{between high and low}} <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses,</b> independent of gene expression level. We conclude that the thyroid was significantly affected at absorbed-dose levels similar to those obtained in radionuclide therapy for tumors. Due to the increased heterogeneous irradiation at low <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses,</b> we suggest that this response partly originates from non-irradiated cells in the tissue, i.e., bystander cells.|$|R
