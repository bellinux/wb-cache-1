40|$|We {{study the}} {{complexity}} theory {{for the local}} distributed setting introduced by Korman, Peleg and Fraigniaud in their seminal paper [3]. They have defined three complexity classes LD (Local Decision), NLD (Nondeterministic Local Decision) and NLD#n. The class LD consists <b>of</b> <b>all</b> languages <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be decided with a constant number of communication rounds. The class NLD consists <b>of</b> <b>all</b> lan-guages <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be verified by a nondeterministic algorithm with a constant number of communication rounds. In order to define the nondeterministic classes, they have transferred the notation of nondeter-minism into the distributed setting {{by the use of}} certificates and verifiers. The classNLD#n consists <b>of</b> <b>all</b> languages <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be verified by a nondeterministic algorithm where each node has access to an oracle for the number of nodes. They have shown the hierarchy LD (NLD (NLD#n. Our main contributions are strict hierarchies within the classes defined by Korman, Peleg and Fraig-niaud. We define additional complexity classes: the class LD(t) consists <b>of</b> <b>all</b> languages <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be decided with at most t communication rounds. The class NLD(O(f)) consists <b>of</b> <b>all</b> languages <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be verified by a local verifier such that the size of the certificates that are needed to verify the language are bounded by a function from O(f). Our main result is the following hierarchy within the nondeterministic classes: LD (NLD(O(1)) (NLD(O(log n)) (NLD(O(n)) (NLD(O(n 2)) ⊆ NLD(O(n 2 + |w|)) = NLD. In order to prove this hierarchy, we give several lower bounds on the sizes of certificates that are needed to verify some languages from NLD. For the deterministic classes we prove the following hierarchy...|$|R
5|$|Because the {{aviation}} industry is especially {{sensitive to the}} weather, accurate weather forecasting is essential. Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off. Turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards. Thunderstorms are a problem for all aircraft because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries, icing due to the heavy precipitation, as well as large hail, strong winds, and lightning, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>can</b> cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight. Volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation, as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds. On a day-to-day basis airliners are routed {{to take advantage of}} the jet stream tailwind to improve fuel efficiency. Aircrews are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination. Additionally, airports often change which runway is being used to take advantage of a headwind. This reduces the distance required for takeoff, and eliminates potential crosswinds.|$|E
