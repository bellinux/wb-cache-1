40|$|AbstractAn {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to test the brake power of Honda Model GX- 120 -four strokes-spark ignited engine. The producer gas was made from dry wood by the gasification process. The producer gas was used as a fuel for the engine. To study the effect of compression ratio and percentage of opened <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> on break power, the compression ratio of 7. 5 : 1 and 9. 3 : 1 and percentage of opened <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> of 30 % and 75 % were used. It was found that the brake power of compression ratio at 9. 3 : 1 with 75 % of opened <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> was 1, 443. 6 Watts at 3, 800 rpm showed the highest break engine power because the high compression ratio was high, and the brake power was also high as the basic theory of an ideal Otto cycle...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{hyperbaric}} chambers {{prevailed in}} medical therapy for vascular diseases and for outbreaks of embolism in emergency situations. This implies {{the achievement of}} environmental pressure conditions from {{two to three times}} higher than the atmospheric one, {{in such a short time}} to require delivery of the air flow that leads to very high intensity noise. The attenuation of this noise is usually performed through the installation of silencers at the air outlets. In this work a series of noise measurements is presented, carried out inside the chamber, limited to the periods it is available to maintenance activities, in various conditions of the opening of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>valve,</b> with and without silencers mounted on the air outlet nozzles and with or without different layers of floor covering. In order to characterize the attenuation capacity of the silencers and to verify that the air flow is the most significant source of noise, a series of noise measurements is also presented, carried out in the open field while emptying a pressurized tank, in various conditions of opening of the exhaust valve, for different types of silencers placed at the outlet. The analysis of the frequency spectra allows to evaluate the behaviour of these devices, at the light of theoretical predictions concerning the aerodynamic noise. The results suggest that the optimization of some of the flow parameters and the operating conditions of the chamber can contribute significantly to the reduction of noise, with a consequent net improvement of such device, in particular under operating conditions of emergency...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In {{the setting}} of the {{increasing}} use of closed systems for reconstitution and preparation of these drugs, we intend to analyze the correct use of these systems in the Hospital Pharmacy, with the objective to minimize the risks of exposure not only for those professionals directly involved, but also for all the staff in the unit, taking also into account efficiency criteria. Method: Since some systems protect against aerosol formation but not from vapours, we decided to review which cytostatics should be prepared using an awl with an <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>valve,</b> in order to implement a new working procedure. We reviewed the formulations available in our hospital, with the following criteria: method of administration, excipients, and potential hazard for the staff handling them. We measured the diameters of the vials. We selected drugs with Level 1 Risk and also those including alcohol-based excipients, which could generate vapours. Outcomes: Out of the 66 reviewed formulations, we concluded that 11 drugs should be reconstituted with this type of awl: busulfan, cabazitaxel, carmustine, cyclophosphamide, eribulin, etoposide, fotemustine, melphalan, paclitaxel, temsirolimus and thiotepa; these represented an 18 % of the total volume of formulations. Conclusions: The selection of healthcare products must be done at the Hospital Pharmacy, because the use of a system with an air valve inlet only for those drugs selected led to an outcome of savings and a more efficient use of materials. In our experience, we confirmed that the use of the needle could only be avoided when the awl could adapt to the different formulations of cytostatics, and this is only possible when different types of awls are available. Besides, connections were only really closed when a single awl was used for each vial. The change in working methodology when handling these drugs, {{as a result of this}} study, will allow us to start different studies about environmental contamination as a future line of work...|$|E
50|$|Another problem {{occurred}} at 2 minutes and 18 seconds into the flight, when cabin pressure dropped from 5.5 to 1 lb/in² (38 to 7 kPa). This malfunction was traced later to the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> snorkel <b>valve.</b> Vibrations had loosened a pin in the snorkel valve {{and allowed the}} valve to open. Ham was safe in his own couch spacesuit and did not suffer any ill effects {{from the loss of}} cabin pressure. His couch spacesuit pressure remained normal, and suit temperature stayed well within the 60 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 26 °C) optimum range.|$|R
50|$|A {{continuous}} flow of compressed air is {{provided to the}} helmet and vented to the surrounding water at a pressure {{very close to the}} ambient pressure at the exhaust port, which lets the diver breathe normally. The helmet must have a non-return <b>valve</b> at the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> port of the helmet, to prevent massive and fatal squeeze, should the air line be cut at the surface. Diving helmets, while very heavy, displace a great deal of water and combined with the air in the suit, would make the diver float with his head out of the water. To overcome this, some helmets are weighted on the corselet, while other divers wear weighted belts which have straps that go over the corselet. Some divers have an <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> control <b>valve,</b> while others may have only one control, the exhaust back-pressure. Helmet divers are subject to the same pressure limitations as other divers, such as decompression sickness and nitrogen narcosis.|$|R
50|$|Rotary {{pumps are}} driven by a {{crankshaft}} that is rotated by handles on two flywheels attached {{to the ends of}} the shaft on each side of the pump. Rotary pumps can be built with two and three cylinders, and are operated by a team of two men. Pistons attached to the crankshaft draw in <b>air</b> through the <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> and then pump it through the outlet valves to an air hose which delivers the air to the helmet of the diver. Cylinders, valves and outlet fittings for air are generally made from brass for corrosion resistance in the marine environment.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} and theoretical calculations {{were made on}} an aircraft-type, single cylinder engine, {{in order to determine}} the physical nature of the inlet process, especially at high piston speeds. The engine was run at speeds from 1, 500 to 2, 600 r. p. m. (mean piston speeds of 1, 370 to 2, 380 feet per minute). Measurements were made of the cylinder pressure during the inlet stroke and of the power output and volumetric efficiency. Measurements were also made, with the engine not running, to determine the resistance and mass of <b>air</b> in the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> port at various crank angles. Results of analysis indicate that mass has an appreciable effect, but friction plays the major part in restricting flow. The observed fact that the volumetric efficiency is considerably less than 100 percent is attributed to thermal effects. An estimate was made of the magnitude of these effects in the present case, and their general nature is discussed...|$|R

50|$|The de Rivaz engine had no timing {{mechanism}} {{and the introduction}} of the fuel mixture and ignition were all under manual control. The compressed hydrogen gas fuel was stored in a balloon connected by a pipe to the cylinder. Oxygen was supplied from the air by a separate <b>air</b> <b>inlet.</b> Manually operated <b>valves</b> allowed introduction of the gas and air at the correct point in the cycle. A lever worked by hand moved a secondary, opposed, piston. This evacuated the exhaust gases, sucked in a fresh mixture and closed the <b>inlet</b> and exhaust <b>valves.</b> A Volta cell was used to ignite the gas within the cylinder by pressing an external button that created an electric spark inside the cylinder. The explosion drove the piston freely up the vertically mounted cylinder, storing the energy by lifting the heavy piston to an elevated position. The piston returned under its own weight and engaged a ratchet that connected the piston rod to a pulley. This pulley was in turn attached to a drum around which a rope was wound. The rope's other end was attached to a second drum on the charette's front wheels. The weight of the piston during its return down the cylinder was enough to turn the drums and move the charette. When the return stroke was over, the ratchet allowed the top drum to disconnect from the piston rod ready for the next powered lift of the piston.|$|R
50|$|IOE engines {{were widely}} used in early motorcycles, {{initially}} with the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> being operated by engine suction instead of a cam-activated valvetrain.

40|$|A {{hydrogen}} recombiner has a recombination tank (1) whose main axis (2) is basically aligned {{in parallel with}} the effect of gravity; the recombination tank features <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> (12), outlet valves (17) and catalyst surfaces (9) of a non-restrictive catalyst aligned in parallel with the main axis (2).

40|$|AbstractThe {{proposed}} {{experimental work}} intends to analyse the thermal {{performance of a}} TES unit incorporated into a ventilation system under different working conditions. The influences of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature and velocity on the air outlet temperature and heat transfer rate were investigated The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature used for the solidification of RT 25 were 10 °C, 12 °C and 14 °C and for the melting 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C. The selected <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocities were {{the same for the}} melting and solidification process: 0. 5 m/s, 1. 4 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. The results suggest that an increase of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity reduces linearly the temperature difference between the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet for the solidification process of the RT 25. Contrary, for the melting of the RT 25, increasing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity does not reduce the temperature difference linearly, increasing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature furthermore from 36 °C to 38 °C did not affect the melting time. The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature plays a significant role on the melting process, reducing linearly the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet temperature difference and the heat transfer rate, however does not influence the solidification process, similar <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet temperature difference and the heat transfer rate were obtained for all condition.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is model-based control of two {{combustion}} engine concepts, Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) and Partially Premixed Combustion (PPC), using physics-based models. The studied combustion concepts hold promise {{of reducing the}} emission levels and fuel consumption of internal combustion engines. A cycle-to-cycle model of HCCI, including heat losses to the cylinder wall, was derived. The continuous heat transfer between the cylinder wall and the gas in the cylinder was approximated by three heat transfer events during each cycle. This allowed the model to capture the main dynamics of the cylinder wall temperature while keeping {{the complexity of the}} resulting model at a tractable level. The model was used to derive model predictive controllers for the combustion phasing using the <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> temperature and <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> closing timing as control signals. The resulting controllers were evaluated experimentally and achieved promising results in terms of set-point tracking and disturbance rejection. Additionally, the differences in performance between using a switched state feedback controller and a hybrid model predictive controller for controlling exhaust recompression HCCI were investigated. The dynamics of exhaust recompression HCCI vary significantly between certain operating points, and the model predictive controller produced smoother transients in both simulations and experiments. A continuous-time model of PPC was derived and implemented in the Modelica language. The model structure, a single-zone model, and implementation platform, JModelica. org, were chosen in order to allow for numerical optimization based on the model equations. The resulting framework allowed the calibration of the model parameters to be formulated as an optimization problem penalizing deviations between a measured pressure trace and that of the model. The calibrated model predicted the effects of variations in the injection timing with satisfactory accuracy...|$|R
