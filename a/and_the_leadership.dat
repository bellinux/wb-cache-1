5|$|Count Zrinski {{found himself}} besieged by a hostile army {{of at least}} 150,000 {{soldiers}} with powerful artillery. Zrinski had assembled a force of around 2,300 Croatian and Hungarian soldiers prior to the siege. These consisted of his personal forces and those {{of his friends and}} allies. The majority of the defenders were Croatian, with a significant Hungarian contingent represented in both the men-at-arms <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership.</b>|$|E

5|$|By 15 March, Soviet commanders {{introduced}} preliminary {{plans for}} an offensive towards Kharkov, assisted by {{a large number of}} reserves. On 20 March, Timoshenko held a conference in Kupiansk to discuss the offensive and a report to Moscow, prepared by Timoshenko's chief of staff, General Lieutenant Ivan Baghramian, summed up the conference, although arguably leaving several key intelligence features out. The build-up of Soviet forces in the region of Barvenkovo and Vovchansk continued well into the beginning of May. Final details were settled following discussions between Stalin, Stavka <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> of the Southwestern Strategic Direction led by Timoshenko throughout March and April, with one of the final Stavka directives issued on 17 April.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, Andronicus tried {{once more}} to strike a decisive blow back at the Turks, this time hiring Catalan mercenaries. Under the {{guidance}} of Michael IX <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> of Roger de Flor, the 6,500-strong Catalan Company {{in the spring and}} summer of 1303 managed to drive back the Turks. The mercenaries' onslaught drove the Turks back from Philadelphia to Cyzicus, in the process causing great destruction to the Anatolian landscape. Once again these gains were thwarted by internal matters. Roger de Flor was assassinated and, in revenge, his company began pillaging the Anatolian countryside. When they finally left in 1307 to attack Byzantine Thrace, the locals welcomed the Ottomans who once again began blockading key fortresses in Asia Minor.|$|E
5|$|Following the Noemvriana, the Allies, {{determined}} to remove Constantine I, established a naval blockade to isolate areas which supported the king. After {{the resignation of}} the king on 15 June 1917, Greece unified under a new king, Alexander, Constantine I's son, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> of Eleftherios Venizelos. It joined World War I {{on the side of the}} Allies. By 1918, the mobilized Greek army provided the numerical superiority the Allies needed on the Macedonian front. The Allied army shortly thereafter defeated the Central Powers forces in the Balkans, followed by the liberation of Serbia and the conclusion of World War I.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Danny Greene and his {{childhood}} friends Billy McComber and Art Sneperger are longshoremen at the Cleveland docks. Meanwhile, the members are exploited by corrupt union boss, Jerry Merke <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> of the ILA union urges Greene {{to run against}} him. Meanwhile, Sneperger can't pay a gambling debt to Cleveland Mafia Capo John Nardi. In return for Sneperger's debt being forgiven, Greene supplies Nardi's crew with goods stolen from the docks. Merke finds out, demands a cut of Greene's profits, and then sends an enforcer to kill him. Instead, Greene beats up the enforcer, then beats up Merke, throws the union leader out of his office, and is later elected union president. He improves the working conditions at the docks while continuing his dealings with Nardi.|$|E
5|$|Miller, the vice-captain, almost {{missed the}} trip to India after turning up late for the voyage. On arrival in India, Miller scored 46 in a draw against North Zone. Miller then captained the Australians in a match against West Zone in Bombay, top-scoring with 106 in a high-scoring draw. In a match against India, Miller took two wickets. At this point, {{with most of the}} team {{suffering}} from dysentery <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> not permitting the team to travel by air, some of the RAAF personnel felt that Hassett should be removed from the captaincy, with Miller as one of the candidates to replace him. This would have increased his prospects of leading Australia. Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when a RAAF plane was acquired to transport the team.|$|E
5|$|The Sixth World Congress in 1961 {{marked a}} {{lessening}} {{of the political}} divisions between the majority of supporters of the International Secretariat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> of the SWP in the United States. In particular, the congress stressed support for the Cuban revolution and a growing emphasis on building parties in the imperialist countries. The sixth congress also criticised the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, its Sri Lankan section, for seeming to support the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which they saw as bourgeois nationalists; the U.S. SWP made similar criticisms.|$|E

5|$|The rule of Michael the Brave, {{with its}} break with Ottoman rule, tense {{relations}} with other European powers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> of the three states, was considered in later periods as the precursor of a modern Romania, a thesis which was argued with noted intensity by Nicolae BÄƒlcescu. This theory became a point of reference for nationalists, {{as well as a}} catalyst for various Romanian forces to achieve a single Romanian state. To Romanian Romantic nationalists, he was regarded as one of Romania's greatest national heroes.|$|E
5|$|The Jana Sangh's {{first major}} campaign, begun in early 1953, centred on {{a demand for}} the {{complete}} integration of Jammu and Kashmir into India. Mookerjee was arrested in May 1953 for violating orders from the state government restraining him from entering Kashmir. He {{died of a heart}} attack the following month, while still in jail. Mauli Chandra Sharma was elected to succeed Mookerjee; however, he was forced out of power by the RSS activists within the party, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> went instead to Upadhyaya. Upadhyay remained the General Secretary until 1967, and worked to build a committed grassroots organisation in the image of the RSS. The party minimised engagement with the public, focusing instead on building its network of propagandists. Upadhyaya also articulated the philosophy of integral humanism, which formed the official doctrine of the party. Younger leaders, such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani also became involved with the leadership in this period, with Vajpayee succeeding Upadhyaya as president in 1968. The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were legislating a uniform civil code, banning cow slaughter and abolishing the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir.|$|E
