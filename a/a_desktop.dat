5|$|The Fastra II is <b>a</b> <b>desktop</b> {{supercomputer}} {{designed for}} tomography. It {{was built in}} late 2009 by the ASTRA (All Scale Tomographic Reconstruction Antwerp) group of researchers of the IBBT (Interdisciplinary institute for BroadBand Technology) VisionLab at the University of Antwerp and by Belgian computer shop Tones, in collaboration with Asus, a Taiwanese multinational computer product manufacturer, as the successor to the Fastra I (built in 2008).|$|E
5|$|JMP is <b>a</b> <b>desktop</b> {{application}} with a wizard-based user interface, while SAS can {{be installed}} on servers. It runs in-memory, instead of on disk storage. According to a review in Pharmaceutical Statistics, JMP is often used as a graphical front-end for a SAS system, which performs the statistical analysis and tabulations. JMP Genomics, used for analyzing and visualizing genomics data, requires a SAS component to operate and can access SAS/Genetics and SAS/STAT procedures or invoke SAS macros. JMP Clinical, used for analyzing clinical trial data, can package SAS code within the JSL scripting language and convert SAS code to JMP.|$|E

5|$|The PowerBook100 was {{the first}} PowerBook to {{incorporate}} SCSI Disk Mode, which allowed it {{to be used as}} an external hard disk on <b>a</b> <b>desktop</b> Macintosh. This provided a convenient method for software to be installed onto the PowerBook or transferred to the desktop, without the need for the 100's optional floppy disk drive. A specialized SCSI cable with a unique connector was required, however, to use any SCSI device on the PowerBook series. A second dedicated cable was required for SCSI Disk Mode. This feature was unique to the 100 until Apple introduced new PowerBooks more than a year later.|$|E
5|$|The Programmer {{accessory}} {{had been}} {{mentioned in the}} earliest advertisement {{but it was not}} featured until March 1974. This was the same size as <b>a</b> <b>desktop</b> calculator and could hold 256 programming steps. (It could be expanded to 512 steps.) It was limited to emulating calculator key presses and simple sequence branching. The programming was done by entering hexadecimal key codes. The combination of the MITS 7440 calculator and the programmer was not nearly as sophisticated as the HP 9830 calculator but $400 for both kits was a fraction of the HP price.|$|E
25|$|In {{personal}} computers, {{all these}} elements are modeled through <b>a</b> <b>desktop</b> metaphor {{to produce a}} simulation called <b>a</b> <b>desktop</b> {{environment in which the}} display represents <b>a</b> <b>desktop,</b> on which documents and folders of documents can be placed. Window managers and other software combine to simulate the desktop environment with varying degrees of realism.|$|E

25|$|One {{big factor}} that determines the {{resource}} usage {{and speed of}} <b>a</b> <b>desktop</b> distribution is the desktop environment it uses. For example, version 10.10 of Lubuntu uses the LXDE desktop and requires a minimum of 128MB of RAM and a PentiumII processor, though the Lubuntu project recommends 256MB - 384MB for a usable system, and at least 512MB for optimal performance; it is a lightweight variant of Ubuntu that, in comparison, uses Unity as <b>a</b> <b>desktop</b> environment and requires a 2GHz processor and 2GB of RAM. The desktop environment can be changed in most Linux distributions, and the same Linux distribution may also have various versions with different desktop environments; examples are Porteus, which comes in LXDE, Xfce and Mate versions, and Zenwalk, which comes in Xfce and Openbox versions.|$|E
50|$|InstallFree <b>Desktop</b> is <b>an</b> entire virtual <b>desktop</b> that {{operates}} {{on top of}} <b>an</b> existing <b>desktop</b> operating system and works in complete separation from it. It does not require any installed components and does not use Virtual Machine-based technology.|$|R
50|$|The {{print engine}} of most All-in-one devices is based either on <b>a</b> home <b>desktop</b> inkjet printer, or on <b>a</b> home <b>desktop</b> laser printer. They may be {{black-and-white}} or colour capable. Laser models {{provide a better}} result for text while inkjet gives a more convincing result for images {{and they are a}} cheaper multifunctional.|$|R
50|$|Microsoft had {{previously}} provided <b>a</b> Virtual <b>Desktop</b> PowerToy for Windows XP, which simulates many desktops {{with the more}} common method of hiding and showing windows in groups, each group being <b>a</b> different <b>desktop.</b> However, the functionality provided is less comprehensive than that of many other virtual desktop solutions (e. g. maintain a window in <b>a</b> given <b>desktop</b> even when its application bar button flashes, etc.). As with all virtual desktop utilities that work by hiding and showing windows, application compatibility problems are common, because application developers do not expect virtual desktops {{to be in use}} on the Windows platform.|$|R
