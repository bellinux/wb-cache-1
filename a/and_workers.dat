Measuring job <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> flow at the firm level, after invoking size limitations or after invoking a correction procedure {{for taking care of}} entry and exit due to administrative causes, lowers the job <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> flows compared to job <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> flows measured at establishment level, with no size limitations and no correction procedure. In a comparative analysis of job <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> flows, this shows that job <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> flows in Norway are lower than job <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> flows in many comparable countries. ...|$|R

Mechanisms of coercive, mimetic, and normative institutional isomorphism developed in DiMaggio and Powell’s theory of organizational isomorphism are applied to provide greater understanding of credit union <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> cooperative scarcity in the US.

While the intelligentsia expressed their dissatisfaction with discussions and publications (bibuła), workers took to the streets.

5|$|Foraging {{behaviour}} {{depends on}} the type of termite. For example, certain species feed on the wood structures they inhabit, and others harvest food that is near the nest. Most workers are rarely found out in the open, and do not forage unprotected; they rely on sheeting and runways to protect them from predators. Subterranean termites construct tunnels and galleries to look for food, <b>and</b> <b>workers</b> who manage to find food sources recruit additional nestmates by depositing a phagostimulant pheromone that attracts workers. Foraging workers use semiochemicals to communicate with each other, <b>and</b> <b>workers</b> who begin to forage outside of their nest release trail pheromones from their sternal glands. In one species, Nasutitermes costalis, there are three phases in a foraging expedition: first, soldiers scout an area. When they find a food source, they communicate to other soldiers and a small force of workers starts to emerge. In the second phase, workers appear in large numbers at the site. The third phase is marked by a {{decrease in the number of}} soldiers present and an increase in the number of workers. Isolated termite workers may engage in Lévy flight behaviour as an optimised strategy for finding their nestmates or foraging for food.|$|E

5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} {{for the failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs <b>and</b> <b>workers</b> who choose not to work because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.|$|E
5|$|Pollen {{is removed}} from flowers {{deliberately}} or incidentally by bumblebees. Incidental removal occurs when bumblebees {{come in contact with}} the anthers of a flower while collecting nectar. When it enters a flower, the bumblebee's body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from the anthers. In queens <b>and</b> <b>workers</b> this is then groomed into the corbiculae (pollen baskets) on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains. Male bumblebees do not have corbiculae and do not purposively collect pollen. Bumblebees are also capable of buzz pollination, in which they dislodge pollen from the anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper gives a {{comprehensive}} picture of job <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> flows {{for the entire}} Danish economy. We exploit a unique central administrative register encompassing all employees of all workplaces across all sectors throughout two business cycles. This enables us to broaden {{the focus of the}} previous literature about job <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> flows which has been concerned exclusively with larger workplaces, especially in the manufacturing sector. We find that manufacturing data underestimate the levels of flows in the other private sector industries as well as the role of small workplaces in the job <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> reallocation processes. As for the cyclicality of job <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> flows, the results of Davis and Haltiwanger are confirmed for the whole Danish economy and the manufacturing industry, but not for the private sector.
