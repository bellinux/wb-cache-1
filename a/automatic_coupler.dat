2500|$|In 1893, {{satisfied}} that an <b>automatic</b> <b>coupler</b> could {{meet the demands}} of commercial railroad operations and, at the same time, be manipulated safely, the United States Congress passed the Safety Appliance Act. [...] Its success in promoting switchyard safety was stunning. Between 1877 and 1887, approximately 38% of all railworker accidents involved coupling. [...] That percentage fell as the railroads began to replace link and pin couplers with automatic couplers. [...] By 1902, only two years after the SAA's effective date, coupling accidents constituted only 4% of all employee accidents. [...] Coupler-related accidents dropped from nearly 11,000 in 1892 to just over 2,000 in 1902, even though the number of railroad employees steadily increased during that decade.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the new diesel {{locomotives}} being introduced were only fitted with <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers,</b> {{rather than the}} dual screw and <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers</b> as fitted to most steam engines of the time. To overcome both problems a number of vans were modified, going through various iterations until solutions could be found.|$|R

2500|$|The twelve aluminium-bodied {{motor cars}} were ordered from Cravens in 1958, and each was {{equipped}} with four traction motors, instead of the two which previous stock had used. They were controlled by a Pneumatic Camshaft Motor (PCM) controller, where an air-operated camshaft controlled the switching of the motors, which was itself governed by an accelerating relay. This system had proved reliable in the control of two motors. In order for it to control four, without a major re-design, pairs of motors were wired together in series, and the controller switched between all four motors operating in series, and the two pairs operating in parallel. In order to protect against wheel-spin, the contoller automatically reset if one motor of a pair began to run faster than the other. Whereas previous bogies had been asymmetric, to ensure that more weight was carried by the axle driven by the motor, the pivot was central as every axle carried a motor. One further innovation was that the fully automatic couplers at the outer ends of the trains were not [...] "handed". Previously, trains were designated with 'A' and 'D' ends, and could only be coupled together by joining an 'A' end of one train to a 'D' end of another. This could cause operational problems, particularly on a line such as the Central, where operating a train right round the Hainualt loop resulted in it facing the wrong way. The 1960 stock avoided this problem by duplicating most of the connections in the <b>automatic</b> <b>coupler,</b> so that trains could be joined either way round. The cars also included a flat floor for the first time, rather than having a raised section over the motor bogies.(previous stock from 1935 to 1962 had flat floors at the centre section only, with a rising transition in the two double doorways to a steeply curved floor 4 inches higher at either end over the bogies).|$|E

All unitscopies had design differents from each other. The first copy of RA1 was originally released with a Scharfenberg <b>automatic</b> <b>coupler</b> (metro coupler) and high footrests. Further, this coupler was replaced by an <b>automatic</b> <b>coupler</b> [...] "SA-3". Third unit was sent for Dubna city operations.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s a {{new type}} of <b>automatic</b> <b>coupler</b> was {{developed}} by the European railways. This was called the UIC <b>automatic</b> <b>coupler</b> and represented a West European variant of the AK69e type and the East European Intermat type. It was intended as a full replacement for the buffers-and-chain setup, as the latter is not suitable for heavy loads, very time-consuming to be connected, and requires intensive maintenance. As it would have had to be introduced all across Europe within a very short time frame, this introduction was repeatedly postponed. In addition, the UIC <b>automatic</b> <b>coupler</b> was not compatible with the existing chain couplings, which would have made it particularly difficult for some of the European state railways to carry out this conversion from a budgetary point of view.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{carriages}} were {{fitted with}} <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers</b> with an implicit agreement that sets {{would not be}} separated; one of the sets in the mid-30's had drawbars fitted between its three carriages experimentally. The <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers</b> {{were expected to be}} temporary, with scharfenberg couplers expected in June 1983 to replace them and the hard-wired electrical and pneumatic links between carriages. However, a derailment in late 2011 revealed that set SN1 on the standard gauge still had [...] between the carriages.|$|R
50|$|During the {{conversion}} to <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers,</b> the vans had their buffers removed and the wagon capacity was increased from 10 to 11 LT.|$|R
50|$|Carriages were {{connected}} by semi-permanent drawbars, {{except for the}} driving ends of motor carriages, and one end of BT carriages, which were provided with <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Section 8 of the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Coupler</b> Act having exonerated the {{employee}} from {{assumption of risk}} under specified conditions, {{the employee}}'s rights in that regard should not be sacrificed by charging him with assumption of risk under another name, for example, with contributory negligence.|$|E
50|$|Russian Empire {{and later}} Soviet Union used buffer and chain couplings, albeit with {{possibly}} wider centres for the buffers, until conversion to <b>automatic</b> SA3 <b>couplers.</b> The SA3 coupler {{was invented in}} 1932. Some wagons were equipped with SA-3 couplers in the 1930s (they could be coupled with chain coupling), but all cars received <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers</b> in 1957.|$|R
25|$|During the 1960s {{most cities}} {{replaced}} them with <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers.</b> But even in modern cars, Albert couplers get installed as emergency couplers for towing a faulty car.|$|R
50|$|When {{built the}} MM's had half the {{autocoupler}} equipment fitted, but had transition hooks for compatibility purposes. These were swapped {{for the full}} <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers</b> between 1933 and 1936.|$|R
50|$|The AAR TypeF TightLock coupler is a Janney <b>automatic</b> <b>coupler</b> {{typically}} used on North American gondola cars that go through rotary car dumpers {{as well as}} on some tank cars. Tank cars carrying hazardous materials are equipped with AAR TypeE double shelf couplers.|$|E
50|$|The SA3 coupler (Soviet <b>Automatic</b> <b>coupler,</b> model 3) used in Russia is more {{advanced}} than the Janney coupler used in the United States. Advantages of the Russian SA3 include: 1. It is always ready to couple, unlike the Janney coupler which requires {{that at least one}} of the couplers has its knuckle open. 2. It has greater gathering range.|$|E
50|$|One early {{example of}} an {{important}} Supreme Court case which relied on legislative intent was Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co. (1904) 196 U.S. 1, where the court decided that a man may sue the railroad for failing to have an <b>automatic</b> <b>coupler</b> since the legislature was attempting to remedy the problem of multiple injuries by railroad coupling.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{designed}} for use as trailer carriages for the Tulloch railmotor fleet, four carriages were built with a similar internal configuration to the BH type, but with <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers</b> at both ends.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hooks and}} chain hold the {{carriages}} together, while the buffers keep the carriages from banging {{into each other}} so that no damage is caused. The buffers can be [...] "dumb" [...] or spring-loaded. That means there are no run-in forces on the coupler. The other benefit compared with <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers</b> is that its lesser slack causes smaller forces on curves; there is a lower probability of a broken coupler in a curve than with <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers.</b> The disadvantage is the smaller mass of the freight that can be hauled by hook and chain couplers (maximum 4000 t).|$|R
50|$|Wagons of {{this group}} are noted in rollingstock {{registers}} as spending anywhere from a week to two months at Newport Workshops around 1932-1934; this is around the time the wagons were fitted with <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The C-AKv coupler is a fully {{automatic}} center coupler for railway vehicles, {{which is designed}} {{as a replacement for}} the European UIC standard chain coupler. Its profile is derived from the Willison design as used on the Russian SA3 coupler. The C-AKv coupler is compatible with both the buffers-and-chain setup and the actual SA3 coupler. C-Akv is from German Compact - Automatische Kupplung vereinfacht, meaning Compact <b>automatic</b> <b>coupler</b> simplified. Often the brand name Transpact is used as name for it.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s the <b>automatic</b> <b>coupler</b> project saw the underframes replaced. The {{new design}} was all-steel, {{reinforced}} with centre sills {{in lieu of}} the truss rods and heavier bracing on the ends, and the brake equipment on the first 201 wagons was upgraded from the previous combined brake cylinder and auxiliary reservoir to a larger brake cylinder and a separate auxiliary reservoir. When the buffers and truss rods were removed in the 1950s, the wagon capacity was boosted a further ton.|$|E
50|$|The end cabs have airconditioning, and are heated using {{waste heat}} from the diesel engine cooling system; the cabins are {{isolated}} from frame vibrations by an air-suspension system. The cab control systems use electronic multifunction display, and joystick control. The trains are permanently coupled whilst in service, and can work in multiple forming consists of up to 630m (7 trains, 35 cars) - the inter-trainset coupling is via a Z-AK type <b>automatic</b> <b>coupler,</b> which includes electrical connections for power and data.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring the {{research}} {{an analysis of}} forces which arise at the car <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers</b> {{in the course of}} electrodynamic braking of a train moving on the given railway profile has been performed. As the initial data dependences of the train velocity and the passed distance on time were taken. The obtained results demonstrate that at braking the maximal longitudinal forces in the <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers</b> are practically independent from the location of empty cars group along the train. The allowed compressive force value of 500 kN for empty cars is not exceeded on condition that they are located in the last third of the train length...|$|R
50|$|Construction {{continued}} through to 1929, terminating with vans no. 624Z, 625Z and 626Z entering service on January 26th that year. Vans fitted with <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers</b> after 1933 were {{marked with a}} large, painted letter A in opposite corners.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} mandated {{the use of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>couplers</b> on all cars on {{the system}} in July 1925. The system was transitioning from vacuum brakes to air brakes at this time, with most freight cars equipped with air brakes by April 1927.|$|R
