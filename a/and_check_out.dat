2500|$|Further August 2007 dates were {{postponed}} for unclear reasons; Hoppus {{stated the}} band {{had decided to}} re-enter the studio in preparation of a second studio album. Hoppus and Barker spent {{the remainder of the}} year in discussions with record companies before announcing that the planned next +44 album would see release via Interscope Records. According to journalist Joe Shooman, little work commenced on the album: [...] "As for +44, there had been months slipping by with no real work on that one aside from writing snippets here and there, although there were also reports flying about that the next tour would take in a lot more of the world including South America." [...] Barker started releasing hip-hop remixes on May 9, 2008, and he hoped to collate his growing collection of remixes with a bunch of new tracks on which he was working. Eventually, the project became a solo album, with Barker producing it all himself. By the following August, Hoppus began recording material for a possible solo studio album at Opera while Barker worked on his solo studio album. [...] "I see him in our studio every week, and we'll be in the room of the studio he's working in, listening to stuff he's recorded, or he'll come into the room where I'm working <b>and</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> my songs," [...] said Hoppus. The duo continued to work together, and Hoppus noted that Barker had laid down drums on several of his tracks.|$|E
