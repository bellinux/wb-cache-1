25|$|Other {{cellular}} hypersensitivities include cytotoxic T {{cell mediated}} <b>auto-immune</b> <b>disease,</b> {{and a similar}} phenomenon; transplant rejection.

In order to create sufficient auto-reactive killer T cells, interleukin-2 must be produced, and this is supplied by CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells can also stimulate cells such as natural killer cells and macrophages via cytokines such as interferon-gamma, encouraging these cytotoxic cells to kill host cells in certain circumstances.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Various <b>auto-immune</b> <b>diseases</b> {{are known}} to coexist in the same {{individual}} and such association suggest {{that there could be}} a common background of immunological distrubance in such cases. Vitiligo has been reported to be associated with various autoimmune disorders from time to time 1 - 3 Similarly pemphigus vulgaris has also been reported to be associated with other <b>auto-immune</b> <b>diseases</b> 4. We are herein reporting a case of vitiligo who developed the lesions of pemphigus vulgaris, a year later...|$|R
25|$|The {{mechanism}} that killer T cells use during auto-immunity is {{almost identical to}} their response against viruses, and some viruses {{have been accused of}} causing auto-immune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Cellular <b>auto-immune</b> <b>disease</b> occurs because the host antigen recognition systems fail, and the immune system believes, by mistake, that a host antigen is foreign. As a result, the CD8+ T cells treat the host cell presenting that antigen as infected, and go on to destroy all host cells (or in the case of transplant rejection, transplant organ) that express that antigen.|$|E
2500|$|The {{immune system}} is a {{multicomponent}} interactive system. [...] It effectively protects the host from various infections. [...] An improperly functioning immune system can cause discomfort, disease or even death. [...] The type of malfunction falls into {{one or more of}} the following major groups: hypersensitivity or allergy, <b>auto-immune</b> <b>disease,</b> or immunodeficiency.|$|E
2500|$|The {{immune system}} must achieve {{a balance of}} {{sensitivity}} in order to respond to foreign antigens without responding to [...] the antigens of the host itself. When the immune system responds to very low levels of antigen that it usually shouldn't respond to, a hypersensitivity response occurs. Hypersensitivity {{is believed to be}} the cause of allergy and some <b>auto-immune</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} and morphological {{review of}} cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity in <b>auto-immune</b> <b>diseases.</b> BackgroundThe risk-benefit ratio of cyclosporine A (CsA) {{is much more}} critical in some <b>auto-immune</b> <b>diseases</b> in comparison to transplantation medicine, due to its renal toxic potential. The present meta-analysis {{is based on an}} a priori defined methodology, and is linked with a review of CsA-induced morphological lesions, in order to draw relevant conclusions with regard to CsA-induced nephrotoxicity in <b>auto-immune</b> <b>diseases.</b> MethodsOnly controlled, randomized trials with a treatment period of two months or more, published from January 1979 to August 1996, were selected for the evaluation of functional renal impairment due to CsA treatment. To assess the risk of developing nephrotoxicity during CsA therapy, individual peak rises in serum creatinine level were compared between the CsA-treated group and the control group. Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in serum creatinine level of 50 % or more above baseline at least once during the study period. Papers reporting CsA-induced renal morphological lesions were reviewed. ResultsA risk difference of 20. 9 % for developing nephrotoxicity, between a therapy with CsA and an alternative therapy, was found. Already after a treatment period of 12 months with low dose CsA (≤ 5 mg/kg/day), de novo nonspecific morphological damage could be induced in patients with <b>auto-immune</b> <b>diseases.</b> ConclusionsFrom this analysis of the literature, it is obvious that a therapy with CsA in patients affected by <b>auto-immune</b> <b>diseases</b> is not without risk. A rigorous evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio is strongly recommended for each patient, with strict monitoring of serum creatinine and CsA trough levels during treatment. Renal biopsies during treatment must be seriously taken into consideration in patients who develop even a slight renal functional impairment, particularly when prolonged therapy of longer than one year, even with low dose CsA (≤ 5 mg/kg/day), is given...|$|R

40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. (Psychology) According to Cunningham (1978) {{there is}} {{a fair amount of}} {{controversy}} that surrounds the possible causes of <b>auto-immune</b> <b>diseases.</b> According to him there are two conflicting categories of causes of which psycho-social causes is one and abnormalities of the immune system is the other. Although a substantial amount of studies concerning the relationship between psychological factors and immune functioning have been done, the results have been inconclusive. The reason for this seems to be that {{there is a}} vast amount of mediating factors. A further aspect that needs {{to be taken into account}} is that psychoneuroimmunological research has focused mainly on adults. Schleifer, Scott, Stein and Keller (1986) is of the opinion that extensive research is required to study the effects of the central nervous system and behaviour during the early development of a person. The study attempted to identify possible psycho-social factors that could contribute to pediatric diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In order to identify factors that are unique to <b>auto-immune</b> <b>diseases</b> four groups were compared i. e, emotional disorders, behavioral disorders, <b>auto-immune</b> <b>diseases</b> and a "normal" group...|$|R

Previous reports suggested that UC {{may have a}} worse prognosis when associated with <b>auto-immune</b> <b>diseases.</b> We compared characteristics at diagnosis and natural history of the disease between classical ulcerative colitis (CUC) and UC associated with <b>auto-immune</b> <b>diseases</b> (CAI) in children. Material and methods. In this study, 67 children followed for UC at Nancy University Hospital between 1993 and 2012 were included: 45 patients in the CUC group and 22 in the CAI group. Results. Median follow-up was 4. 8 years. Median age at diagnosis was 11. 6 years in the CAI group and 9. 8 years in the CUC group. Time between symptoms onset and diagnosis was broadly similar {{in the two groups}} (< 3 months) and {{there were no significant differences}} regarding biological and histological findings. At 5 years, the need for corticosteroids and azathioprine did not differ between the CAI and the CUC groups. There was also no significant difference between the two groups regarding infliximab use at 1 and 5 years. Conclusions. In this pediatric study, CAI had similar characteristics at baseline as CUC.
