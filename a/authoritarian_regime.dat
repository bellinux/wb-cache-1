Sources believe these noble meanings are far from the truth and are nothing more than propaganda, to provide an honourable justification to their choice.|$|E
5|$|Widely {{considered}} one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive personality cult within the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind Marxism–Leninism and thus a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive individual, Lenin is viewed by supporters as a champion of socialism and the working class, while critics on both the left and right emphasize his role as founder and leader of an <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regime</b> responsible for political repression and mass killings.|$|E
5|$|With Kogălniceanu's participation, the <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regime</b> {{established}} by Cuza succeeded in promulgating {{a series of}} reforms, notably introducing the Napoleonic code, public education, and state monopolies on alcohol and tobacco. At the same time, the regime became unstable and was contested by all sides, especially after his adulterous affair with Marija Obrenović became the topic of scandal. In early 1865, Cuza came into conflict with his main ally Kogălniceanu, whom he dismissed soon after. Over the following months, the administration went into financial collapse, {{no longer able to}} provide state salaries, while Cuza came to rely on his own camarilla (courtiers).|$|E

In 1971, Banda was declared president-for-life. For almost 30 years, Banda presided over a rigidly <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regime,</b> which ensured that Malawi did not suffer armed conflict.

5|$|In the 19th century, the {{official}} view was increasingly questioned. The aristocratic Ancien Régime had been weakened severely during the Napoleonic Wars, when the Confederacy {{had been a}} French satellite state. The episode of the Helvetic Republic, short-lived as it had been, had instilled democratic ideals in the population. The restauration of the Ancien Régime {{after the end of}} the Napoleonic era proved to be only temporary, until Switzerland became a federal state in 1848 when its first democratic constitution was passed. During the restoration, democratic publishers instrumented and interpreted the history of the peasant war as an allegory on the then current struggle for democracy, seeing the peasant war of 1653 as an early precursor of their own efforts to overcome the <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regime.</b> Well-known examples are the illustrations by Martin Disteli from 1839/40, who used scenes from the peasant war in such allegoric ways.|$|E
5|$|The general {{atmosphere}} of enrichment and satisfaction {{during the period}} of economic growth in Côte d'Ivoire made it possible for Houphouët-Boigny to maintain and control internal political tensions. His easygoing <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regime,</b> where political prisoners were almost nonexistent, was well accepted by the population. However, the economic crisis that began in the 1980s caused a sharp decline in living conditions for the middle class and underprivileged urban populations. According to the World Bank, the population living below the poverty threshold went from 11% in 1985 to 31% by 1993. Despite the implementation of certain measures, such as the reduction of the number of young French workers (who worked abroad while serving in the military) from 3,000 to 2,000 in 1986, allowing many jobs to go to young Ivorian graduates, the government failed to control the rising rates of unemployment and bankruptcy in many companies.|$|E

5|$|The political, {{economic}} and social reforms that were brought about during the relatively short duration of the Batavian Republic have had a lasting impact. The confederal structure of the old Dutch Republic was permanently replaced by a unitary state. For {{the first time in}} Dutch history, the constitution that was adopted in 1798 had a genuinely democratic character. For a while the Republic was governed democratically, although the coup d'état of 1801 put an <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regime</b> in power, after another change in constitution. Nevertheless, the memory of this brief experiment with democracy helped smooth the transition to a more democratic government in 1848 (the constitutional revision by Johan Rudolph Thorbecke, limiting the power of the king).

40|$|What is {{replacing}} the comprehensive Soviet safety net {{and health care}} restructuring in post-Soviet <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regimes</b> of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan? I explore {{the conditions under which}} <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regimes</b> use health care provision as part of their survival strategies and how <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regimes</b> incorporate nongovernmental organizations in health care provision. I argue that two factors shape authoritarian states' health care strategies: elite perceptions of political contestation shape state health care spending decisions and economic self-sufficiency determines whether states have privatized health care service provision to replace or supplement government services and structures the nature of state-NGO relations. The resulting health care strategies are not static, but evolve as political and economic pressures change. Rather than three countries over a 20 -year time period, I analyze specific periods and cycles within each country to capture the dynamic nature of state health care strategies. I find that <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regimes</b> take seriously the role of societal actors as sources of political competition, constituencies to be won over through social welfare provision, and as partners or competitors in meeting the population's social welfare needs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract While {{much has}} been written about {{democracy}} and democratization, far less attention has been paid to the institutional organization of <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regimes.</b> Scholars have focused on the causes, economic policies, societal support, intra-elite conflicts, or human-rights violations of <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regimes.</b> More recently, political scientists have also studied the role of elections and legislatures on the survival of <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regimes.</b> However, the very different ways in which <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regimes,</b> and military regimes in particular, organize the government, occupy the state apparatus, and modify the country’s political institutions have largely gone under-theorized. This essay contributes to fill in this void by analyzing how the last military regimes of Argentina (1976 – 1983) and Brazil (1964 – 1985) organized power within the state and the legacies of such organization on the institutions of federalism. The essay argues that variation in the organization of the state under the military regimes accounts for the divergent origins of post-developmental decentralization, which in turn explains the contrasting evolution of intergovernmental relations in each country. The article contributes to the recen...|$|R
40|$|Numerous authoritarian states use {{institutions}} {{usually associated}} with democratic regimes like a constitution, elections, and a legislature. This seems to be counterintuitive. <b>Authoritarian</b> <b>regimes</b> should rather shrink away from democratic institutions. Elections can be won by the opposition and legislatures can make decisions against {{the interests of the}} ruler. So, why do autocratic regimes install institutions which limit their power and threaten their survival in office? Assuming actors behave rationally, one should expect authoritarian rulers only to introduce procedures working in their favor. This study looks at the effect of institutions in <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regimes.</b> The findings suggest that legislatures significantly lower the chances of regime breakdown in the long run. However, particularly in election years, <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regimes</b> are facing a higher likelihood of failure...|$|R

As happened in Tunisia and Egypt, <b>authoritarian</b> <b>regimes</b> can also break down without pacts, negotiations, and compromises. Although this is a much less frequent path, autocracies are also defeated by mass-based uprisings in which the emergence of a cross-class and cross-ideological coalition throughout (almost) the whole country imposes a regime change. In Algeria, on the contrary, it was exactly the non-emergence of a broad opposition coalition that explained the authoritarian stability...|$|R
