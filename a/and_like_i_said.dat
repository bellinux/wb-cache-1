There's nothing really generic about this album, in that when I say generic I mean it's not typically RnB or typically soul or typically pop, it's got different elements from the three. It's quite live, it's got live sounding drums <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> guitars and piano. It's pop songs but the lyrics are a bit deeper.

5000|$|In November 2005. Ceberano {{was asked}} to sing with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra.

That was truly an honour,” she says. “It all started when I performed with the WASO back in 2001 at the Sandleford winery; it was such a special show, competing with over-flying jets and ominous storm clouds, we proceeded to create something that was special for all of us, on many different levels.” She continued; “For me it was an opportunity to experience the grandeur of sound and {{the ebb and flow of}} an orchestra. Being that I’m a contemporary-styled singer I was unaccustomed to the lack of drum and bass and felt pulled back and forth like taffy. Needless to say, once sorted, we really started to rock ‘n’ roll!“When asked to repeat the performance again in November 2005. I was determined to have a witness, by that, I mean some recorded evidence that 'the show actually happened'. I basically begged both WASO and the ABC to let me record sound and visuals. I know, indulgent perhaps, but heh, it’s not every day or just any contemporary artist that ever gets the invitation <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> I wanted a witness. So maybe I’ve finally reached that age in my life where people are actually doing what I say, or perhaps the threat of a hissy fit was just too unbearable to contemplate for the few loyal associates I work with… All I know is that the WASO created for me a special place for me to sing my heart out, singing songs of my life and to feel like a diva.” ...|$|E

And we played it about 6 or 7 times [...].and [...]. do you remember which take number it was? Take number 6. We just stopped, that was it. We recorded the song, it was done.

It’s a completely live song except for the harmonies. “It’s a song about looking back on your life and seeing changes happening, and for once for me, looking forward and thinking… ya know…things are gonna change for the better ‘maybe this year will be better than the last’ and uh… and so, like a lot of songs on the end of album it’s not about everything turning out great, but it at least is about hope…and the possibilities …” ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Better Angels" [...] was {{directed}} by Guy Ferland and written by Evan Reilly and showrunner Glen Mazzara. The episode features the death of Shane Walsh, who was stabbed in the chest by Rick Grimes. Subsequently, Shane reanimates into a zombie and is later {{shot in the head}} by Carl Grimes. Initial talks of killing off the character commenced before the auditioning process of the series. Because of the short length of the first season of The Walking Dead, producers decided to retain the idea until the following season. Writer Robert Kirkman remarked: [...] "We knew from Day 1 when we sat down in the writers' room to pull out the second season {{that this was going to}} be the season that Shane died. It was always about working toward that and building up that character and setting up this confrontation between Rick and Shane." [...] Jon Bernthal admitted that he had no coaching prior to the scene, and said that many of the writers and cast members were divided on how to execute the sequence. [...] "There was a lot of discussion going back and forth, a lot of arguing going back and forth on what that last scene actually should be — between myself and Andy and the writers. And everybody kind of got their own little say in what that last scene actually was." [...] In his interview with Entertainment Weekly, Bernthal recalled the production of the scene:We shot that scene all night long. And the entire cast came out and spent the entire night out on that field to be there for the last scene, and Jeff DeMunn ... actually had been gone. He lives on a farm in upstate New York, and he had flown down and surprised me to be there for my last scene, which just touched me. <b>And</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> there was a lot of feeling about the last scene. The writers wanted it to be one way, the actors wanted it one way, the producers wanted it to be another way, I think everybody just sort of had their idea of what that scene should be, and it was just Andy and I in the woods walking out together, and Andy and I turned to each other and said, [...] "You know what, man, this is you and me. Let's do this for you and me.”Speculation related to Bernthal's release first surfaced in January 2012, when it was announced that he was negotiating with Frank Darabont to be a part of his upcoming television project L.A. Noir, which later became known as Mob City.|$|E
