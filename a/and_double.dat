5|$|Along with {{quadratic}} probing <b>and</b> <b>double</b> hashing, linear probing {{is a form}} of open addressing. In these schemes, {{each cell}} of a hash table stores a single key–value pair. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a cell of the hash table that is already occupied by another key, linear probing searches the table for the closest following free location and inserts the new key there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a cell with a matching key or an empty cell.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} haploid oil palm plants <b>and</b> homozygous <b>doubled</b> haploid oil palm plants. The invention also relates to methods for producing and selecting haploid <b>and</b> <b>doubled</b> haploid plants. More particularly, but not exclusively, the method {{may be used}} for selecting haploid <b>and</b> <b>doubled</b> haploid oil palm plants. Haploid <b>and</b> <b>doubled</b> haploid plants are selected by a large-scale screening based on a combination of the phenotype with the use of molecular methods combined with flow cytometry techniques to identify haploid <b>and</b> <b>doubled</b> haploid plants. More particularly, a method for selecting haploid <b>and</b> <b>doubled</b> haploid plants is described comprising: (a) germinating seeds; (b) selecting seedlings with atypical phenotype; (c) assessing heterozygosity using markers; (d) isolating cells from the seedlings and determining the DNA content of the cells; and (e) isolating and purifying the DNA and using defined molecular markers to characterise the genotype of the plant. The haploid oil palm plants {{may be used for}} producing homozygous doubled haploid oil palms: doubled haploids may be intercrossed to produce uniform F. sub. 1 hybrids of superior properties. ...|$|R
