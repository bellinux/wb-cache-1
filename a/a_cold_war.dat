5|$|In 2013, the US Government Accountability Office said a {{shortage}} of lithium-7 critical to the operation of 65 out of 100 American nuclear reactors “places their ability to continue to provide electricity at some risk”. The problem stems from the decline of US nuclear infrastructure. The equipment needed to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7 is mostly <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> <b>war</b> leftover. The US shut down most of this machinery in 1963, when it had a huge surplus of separated lithium, mostly consumed during the twentieth century. The report {{said it would take}} five years and $10 million to $12 million to reestablish the ability to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7.|$|E
5|$|The Angolan Civil War was notable {{due to the}} {{combination}} of Angola's violent internal dynamics and massive foreign intervention. The war became <b>a</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> struggle, as both the Soviet Union and the United States, along with their respective allies, provided significant military assistance to parties in the conflict. Moreover, the Angolan conflict became closely intertwined with the Second Congo War in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, {{as well as with}} the South African Border War.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} two {{short-lived}} television series based upon Casablanca, both sharing the title. The first, <b>a</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> espionage program set during the production's present day, aired on ABC {{as part of the}} wheel series Warner Bros. Presents in hour-long episodes from 1955 to 1956, with Charles McGraw as Rick and Marcel Dalio, who played Emil the croupier in the movie, as the police chief. The second series, briefly broadcast on NBC in April 1983, starred David Soul as Rick and was cancelled after 3 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Two earlier {{business}} decisions by the Chicago Sun-Times led to substantial savings {{of time and}} money during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness, to withstand <b>a</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> attack, and thus {{did not have to be}} broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building anew.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere on the Camp, the Army began {{replacing}} the wartime Nissen huts with more permanent structures. New barracks opened in 1955, and the Headquarters of the Army in Scotland arrived {{the same year}} from Edinburgh Castle. Further land was purchased from Lord Rosebery and married quarters were built close to the river. In 1966, a purpose-built office block, by architects Bowhill Gibson and Laing, was constructed within the walled garden, and named Annandale Block in honour of the builder of Craigiehall. Craigiehall Camp was also the site of <b>a</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> Anti-Aircraft Operations Room, built in the 1950s. The two-storey, reinforced concrete structure was listed in 2016 as the best surviving example of its type in Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Robert James Fischer (March 9, 1943January 17, 2008) was an American chess {{grandmaster}} and {{the eleventh}} World Chess Champion. Many consider {{him to be}} the greatest chess player of all time. In 1972, he captured the World Chess Championship from Boris Spassky of the USSR in a match held in Reykjavík, Iceland, publicized as <b>a</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> confrontation, which attracted more worldwide interest than any chess championship before or since. In 1975, Fischer refused to defend his title when an agreement could not be reached with FIDE, the game's international governing body, over one of the conditions for the match. This allowed Soviet GM Anatoly Karpov, who had won the qualifying Candidates' cycle, to become the new world champion by default under FIDE rules.|$|E

25|$|After the Second World War, Gamal Abdel Nasser, {{the leader}} of Egypt, was a {{significant}} player {{in the rise of}} Arab nationalism. Opposed to the British control of the Suez Canal Zone and concerned at Egypt becoming <b>a</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> battleground Nasser pushed for a collective Arab security pact {{within the framework of the}} Arab League. A key aspect of this was the need for economic aid that was not dependent on peace with Israel and the establishment of U.S. or British military bases within Arab countries. Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal and directly challenged the dominance of the Western powers in the region. At the same time he opened Egypt up as <b>a</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> zone by receiving aid and arms shipments from the Soviet bloc countries that were not dependent on treaties, bases and peace accords. However, because of the connotations for Cold War dominance of the region, Egypt also received aid from the U.S.A., who sought to promote the emerging Arab nationalism as a barrier to communism.|$|E
