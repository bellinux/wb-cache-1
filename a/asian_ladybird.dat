40|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird,</b> Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), {{has been}} {{introduced}} in Western Europe to control aphid and coccid populations in greenhouses. This exotic species rapidly adapted to temperate climatic conditions and invaded all Europe in few years. Now, H. axyridis is causing damages to the ecosystems through e. g. intraguild predation (IGP) with native species. We evaluated, in 2009 and 2010, the occurrence of aphid natural enemies (hoverflies, coccinellids and lacewings) in several agro-ecosystems (corn, wheat, potato, broad bean) in northern Wallonia (Belgium). Five dominating aphidophagous species were observed, in decreasing order of importance: Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer), Chrysoperla carnea sensus lato (Stephens), Coccinella septempunctata (Linné), Harmonia axyridis and Propylea quatuordecimpunctata (Linné). The Multicolored <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird</b> represents 8, 7 % of all observed aphidophagous species and 23, 9 % of coccinellids. Moreover, H. axyridis occurrence is two-times less important than C. 7 -punctata. These results highlight that this invasive species is currently not the most abundant in southern Belgium agro-ecosystems and would not influence other aphid predators in those particular ecosystems.

40|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird</b> beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{invasive}} insects in the world. Originally introduced into the USA and Europe for the biological control of pest insects, it has recently gained the status of an invasive species. There is little data on the differences between invasive and non-invasive populations at the genetic level. In this research mtDNA sequences of the COI gene from specimens of native and non-native populations were compared.

40|$|The {{invasive}} multicoloured <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird,</b> Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), forms large aggregations inside dwellings to overwinter. In {{order to}} highlight the specific features of infested houses, we investigated {{a large number of}} overwintering sites in Wallonia between 2007 and 2011. These sites were characterized through a survey sent to homeowners confronted to invasion problems. The results indicate that H. axyridis preferentially selects isolated brick houses with red or white fronts to take shelter. Aggregations are mostly located at the first floor, essentially inside south or west oriented rooms. Furthermore, ladybirds generally gathered into wooden windows frames facing south or west, and to a lesser extent, in the upper corners of walls presenting the same orientation. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of ladybird beetle (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) eggs are apparently infertile-they do not develop an embryo and are consumed by larvae hatching within the egg batch. The predicted benefits of egg consumption for larvae are empirically well supported. An important question, however, remains: are these eggs a maternal strategy to feed offspring (i. e., trophic eggs) or did egg eating evolve to exploit unavoidably infertile eggs? We investigated the adaptive value of infertile eggs in laboratory experiments with multicoloured <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybirds</b> (Harmonia axyridis). Female H. axyridis were assigned to low and high resource environments for brief intervals; we predicted that tactics to facilitate egg cannibalism, such as infertile egg production and hatching asynchrony, would be adopted in low food environments in which starvation risk for offspring is greater. We conducted two experiments in this manner that provided females with information about resource levels through prey feeding or scent. We also observed female oviposition patterns and tested for infertile egg distributions that departed from random. Females produced 56 % more infertile eggs in the low vs. the high food treatment; however, hatching synchrony did not change. We consider a potential confound between information and nutrition state unlikely because ladybirds are well able to tolerate low food for 24 h, the duration of trials, and because females were in good condition when trials began. Results suggest that ladybirds use information from prey encounter to manipulate the proportion of trophic eggs {{in a manner consistent}} with the adaptive hypothesis, the first evidence of trophic egg plasticity in a non-eusocial insect. © Springer-Verlag 2005...|$|R
40|$|The multicoloured <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybirds,</b> Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), form large aggregations inside {{dwellings}} {{to survive}} cold winters, causing annoyance to householders {{due to their}} abundance, allergenic properties and problems consequent on reflex bleeding. Flight to overwintering sites and macrosite choice of this species is well documented. H. axyridis shows a hypsotactic behaviour and a clear preference for contrasting visual elements. However, how the microsite is selected remains undocumented, although {{a better understanding of}} the factors implicated could lead to the development of new control methods for this pest. In this work, we hypothesised that non-volatile compounds are involved in the microsite choice and aggregation of this beetle. Long chain hydrocarbons were identified at aggregation sites, comprising saturated and unsaturated homologues. An aggregation bioassay was then conducted on overwintering individuals, highlighting the retention capacity of the identified compounds on the tested ladybirds. Additional investigations showed that. H. axyridis males and females, originating from overwintering sites, deposit a similar blend of molecules while walking. A Y-shaped tube assay revealed that this blend is used by male and female congeners as cue allowing individuals to orientate towards the treated side of the olfactometer. These results suggest the use of two different blends of long chain hydrocarbons by. H. axyridis during its aggregative period, the first one to lead conspecifics towards aggregation sites (microsites) and the second to ensure the cohesion of the aggregation. These findings support the potential use of these blends, in association with volatiles, in the design of traps in order to control infestations of this species in dwellings. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird,</b> Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), was {{imported}} in 1997 in Belgium {{to control}} aphid populations in greenhouses. It took only {{few years to}} the insect to get adapted to temperate climate conditions and to spread out all over Europe. Now, H. axyridis {{is one of the}} coccinellid with the biggest size in Belgium, causing damages to the ecosystems through e. g. intraguild predation (IGP). We are still lacking information about the consequences of the introduction of this superpredator in our agro-ecosystems. This work focuses on the potential impacts of H. axyridis on the entomofauna associated with several crops (potatos, corn, wheat, broad bean). We evaluated in 2009 the occurrence as well as the interactions between aphids and their natural enemies (hoverflies, coccinellids and lacewings) in several agro-ecosystem sites in northern Wallonia. After one year of field observations, were found thirteen coccinellid species, most of the catched individuals being H. axyridis with 64 % of the coccinellids, Propylea 14 -punctata, 15 %, or Coccinella 7 -punctata, 14 %. This invasive ladybird dominates the group of coccinellids generally in all crops in north Wallonia. The results with the sticky traps show that the maximum occurrence of H. axyridis in crops is observed in chicory, sugar beet and potatoes. The relationship aphid-ladybird in wheat for example, brings out that increase of density of <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird</b> in mid-July follow the increase of aphids (Sitobion avenae, Sitobion fragariae, Metopolophium dirhodum, Aphis fabae) in the end of June. We also observe that, in most agro-ecosystems, hoverflies and lacewings are the dominant aphid natural enemies. In all crops investigate, the multicolored ladybird occurs with 5 % of the aphidophagous after the Chrysopidae, 12 % and the Syrphidae, 76 %. In 2009, the agro-ecosystems with the most aphidophagous species are carrot and broad bean and these habitats are dominated by hoverflies. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Because {{relatedness}} is {{high and}} dispersal is limited, {{one would expect to}} see higher levels of altruistic behaviour among clonal organisms than among animals of lesser relatedness. Enigmatically, however, parthenogenetic aphids do not emit alarm signals when a predator first enters a colony but only after being captured. Here, we report that an aphid smearing alarm pheromone directly onto a predator decreases the predation risk for clone-mates as the predator continues to search for additional prey. Adult multicoloured <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird</b> beetles, Harmonia axyridis, daubed with alarm pheromone caused a greater proportion of aphids to drop off a plant and escape predation than did predators lacking pheromone droplets. Thus, along with direct fitness benefits of individual protection, aphid alarm signalling behaviour may have evolved through inclusive fitness benefits of protecting clone-mates by scent-marking predators...|$|E

We investigate the impact of captive breeding on several traits of this ladybird such as genetic diversity, fecundity, survival and pathogen resistance. We conducted an experiment in the laboratory to compare the fecundity and the susceptibility to the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana of wild and biocontrol adults of H. axyridis. We compiled these new findings with already published data. Altogether, our findings suggest that mass rearing of biological control agents may strongly impact genetic diversity and life-history traits.

40|$|These {{last few}} years the multicolored <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird,</b> Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), {{previously}} introduced in Europe and North America as a biological control agent, has swiftly spread out on those territories and {{turns out to be}} a pest in several ways. In order to improve understanding of several key points of the biology of this ladybird, a novel fast-GC method of quantification of harmonine, the main defense alkaloid of H. axyridis, has been designed and validated using the accuracy profile concept for concentrations ranging from 13 to 264 µg/individual. This method allows quantifying harmonine in a single insect with a maximal error risk of 20 %. For ladybirds collected in spring, mean harmonine concentration observed was 106. 6 µg/individual with a very high standard deviation of 80. 2 µg/individual, which can easily be explained by the strong asymmetry of the results distribution. Males and females seem equally chemically protected as the harmonine concentration did not significantly differ between sexes. This method is currently used to improve our comprehension of several key points of H. axyridis biology including aggregation behavior and aposematism. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Intraguild {{predation}} (IGP) can be {{an important}} factor influencing the effectiveness of aphid natural enemies in biological control. In particular, aphid parasitoid foraging could be influenced by the presence of predators. This study investigated the effect of larvae of the predatory hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus DeGeer (Diptera: Syrphidae) and the multicolored <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird</b> Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) on the foraging behavior of the aphid parasitoid, Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae) in choice experiments using a leaf disc bioassay. Wasp response to chemical tracks left by those predator larvae was also tested. Parasitoid behavior was recorded using the Observer (Noldus Information Technology, version 5. 0, Wageningen, the Netherlands). The experiments were conducted under controlled environmental conditions using leaves of the broad bean plant, Vicia faba L. (Fabaceae) with Myzus persicae Sulzer (Homoptera: Aphididae) as the host complex. A. ervi females avoided aphid patches when larvae of either predator were present. A similar avoidance response was shown by A. ervi to aphid patches with E. balteatus larval tracks, whereas no significant response was observed to tracks left by H. axyridis larvae. It was concluded that IG predator avoidance shown by the aphid parasitoid A. ervi may be a factor affecting their distribution among host patches. © 2013 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird</b> Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is {{regarded}} as an invasive species {{in many parts of}} the world. In a previous study we hypothesised that H. axyridis enters diapause at the end of October and then shifts to a quiescent state in December in northwestern Europe. In the present study we test this idea of a short, early period of diapause by sampling beetles from their hibernation sites immediately after their migratory flights in October, subsequently keeping them in outdoor cages, and then, after certain time-intervals, measuring the pre-oviposition time under optimal egg-laying laboratory conditions at 25 degrees C. We did this at both short (12 L) and long (16 L) photoperiods, since a photoperiodic response is an indicator of true diapause, rather than quiescence. A significant, albeit small, difference in pre-oviposition period between the two photoperiods, which disappears in December, corroborates our earlier hypothesis that the ladybirds are in a state of diapause until mid-December. Compared with that of native ladybirds the diapause of H. axyridis generally is relatively short and weak; moreover, it appears to have become shorter over the last decade. This flexibility in diapausing behaviour may be an important factor that contributes to the invasive success of H. axyridis...|$|E

Studies {{have been carried out}} on three different species of insects: 1) Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera Coccinellidae) which have been assessed for ecological aspects such as interspecific predation and sperm survival in overwintering females. The results obtained show, in the first case, larvae belonging to the species Chrysoperla carnea as a superior intraguild predator on aggressive invasive and large Multicolored <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird</b> H. axyridis larvae while, in the latter case, a very high survival ability of sperm over winter was recorded. 2) the Chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus which has been evaluated for its degree of infestation and arthropod associated fauna in Sardinia.

40|$|Winemakers, {{small fruit}} growers, and homeowners are {{concerned}} with noxious compounds released by multicolored <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird</b> beetles (Harmonia axyridis, Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). New method based on headspace solid phase microextraction (HS‐SPME) coupled with multidimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry—olfactometry (MDGC‐MS‐O) system was developed for extraction, isolation and simultaneous identification of compounds responsible for the characteristic odor of live H. axyridis. Four methoxypyrazines (MPs) were identified in headspace volatiles of liveH. axyridis as {{those responsible for the}} characteristic odor: 2, 5 ‐dimethy 1 ‐ 3 ‐methoxypyrazine (DMMP), 2 ‐isopropy 1 ‐ 3 ‐methoxypyrazine (IPMP), 2 ‐sec‐buty 1 ‐ 3 ‐methoxypyrazine (SBMP), and 2 ‐isobuty 1 ‐ 3 ‐methoxypyrazine (IBMP). To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first report of H. axyridis releasing DMMP and the first report of this compound being a component of the H. axyridis characteristic odor.

The Convention on Biological Diversity and the 10 th Conference of the Parties (Nagoya in 2010), identified invasive alien species (IAS) as one of five major pressures driving biodiversity loss, and ultimately extinction of species. However, there are few examples of causal relationships between IAS and species declines. IAS afford {{a unique opportunity to}} accurately assess threats to biodiversity because the time at which an IAS arrives within an ecosystem is often known, unlike other drivers of change. We examined trends in distribution of native ladybirds from large-scale and long-term annual citizen-science surveys before and after the arrival of the predatory harlequin (or <b>Asian)</b> <b>ladybird</b> Harmonia axyridis, an IAS that is rapidly expanding across North America and Europe. We report rapid, dramatic and ongoing declines in the distribution of formerly common and widespread native ladybirds in direct response to the arrival of H. axyridis in Belgium and Britain. The dramatic decline of A. bipunctata over the five years following the arrival of H. axyridis is of particular note. Trends in ladybird abundance revealed similar patterns of declines in ladybirds across Belgium, Britain and Switzerland. Together, these parallel analyses show H. axyridis to be displacing native ladybirds with a high niche overlap, probably through predation and competition.

40|$|The Multicolored <b>Asian</b> <b>Ladybird,</b> Harmonia axyridis, is an {{extremely}} successful invasive species. Here we suggest that, in addition to many other traits, the dorsal spines of its larvae contribute to their success, as suggested by behavioral observations of agonistic interactions between H. axyridis and European coccinellids. In coccinellids, the role of dorsal spines in these interactions has been poorly studied {{and they could be}} a physical protection against intraguild predators. Dorsal spines of second instar H. axyridis larvae were removed with micro-scissors, which resulted in spineless larvae after molting (spineless group). These larvae were then exposed to starved Coccinella septempunctata larvae. Two control categories were also submitted to interactions: H. axyridis larvae with all their spines (control group) and with their spines, but injured by pin stings (injured group). Spine removal at the second instar did not hamper H. axyridis development. The bite rate by C. septempunctata was significantly higher on the spineless H. axyridis and more dorsally located compared to the control and injured groups, while no bite rate difference was observed between the injured and the control group. Our results suggest that in addition to behavioral and chemical defenses, the dorsal spines play a significant protective role against bites. Therefore, spines in ladybirds could be considered as a morphological defense against intraguild predation. In H. axyridis, these defenses might contribute to its success in food resources already exploited by other guild members and thus further facilitate the invasion of new areas...|$|E
40|$|The Multicoloured <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird,</b> Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), is one {{of these}} species which was {{intentionally}} introduced for biological control and has spread from its native range in Central and Eastern Asia to large parts of North and South America, Europe, and Africa. The decline of native species is linked to the spread and the aggressive behaviour of H. axyridis. From 2009, we evaluated the population densities of aphids predator and predator diversities, with a special focus on H. axyridis in agroecosystems of Wallonia (South of Belgium). First, field crops preferences of H. axyridis were determined. Later, changes linked to aphid’s predator populations over time were evaluated. Finally, H. axyridis population changes between two crop farming methods were also evaluated. Samplings performed in agroecosystems highlighted that the community of aphid's predator is composed of few dominant species: three coccinellids (Coccinella septempunctata L., P. quatuordecimpunctata L., and H. axyridis), one syrphid (Episyrphus balteatus De Geer), and one chrysopid (Chrysoperla carnea Stephens). We demonstrated that H. axyridis do not invade all crops at the same rate, maize and broad bean being more infested than wheat and potato at both larval and adult stages. Moreover, H. axyridis populations in maize have strongly increased from 2009 to 2011. Finally, we showed that organic farming do not contribute to increase the abundance of H. axyridis but leads to increase the total abundance of aphid’s natural enemies. Peer reviewe...|$|E

In two-choice test, we combined pairs of studied species: A. f cirsiiacanthoidis x A. pisum, A. pisum x A. sambuci, A. sambuci x A. f cirsiiacanthoidis. We put 10 aphids of each of the two species combined into a plastic Petri dish and then we introduced one ladybird adult or larva. We made 20 replicates with adults. We found that there was statistical difference only in the combination A. sambuci vs. A. f cirsiiacanthoidis, where males consumed more individuals of the toxic aphid A. sambuci. For this combination, we then made 20 replicates with larvae who preyed in contrast with males more of the suitable food A. f cirsiiacanthoidis than toxic A. sambuci. We also studied the influence of contrasting background on food choice in adults. We used both tests and all combinations. We found that females did not prefer any aphid species, except for the black A. f cirsiiacanthoidis being consumed more often than the green A. pisum on black background.

[Methods] The impact of four of these volatiles; methyl-salycilate, cis- 3 -hexenyl acetate, hexenol, and 1 -hexanol, was tested on the wheat aphid [Sitobion avenae (Fabricus) (Homoptera: Aphididae) ] and two major predators of this pest encountered in field crops, the hoverfly (Episyrphus balteatus (DeGeer) (Diptera: Syrphidae) ] and the multicoloured <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird</b> [Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) ]. Different doses of these chemicals were tested by performing four arm-olfactometer and wind-tunnel assays.

Over the last few decades concerns have been raised about its invasiveness in those areas where it has been introduced. A test was carried out to investigate the ability of H. axyridis to survive, grow and reproduce at higher temperatures (30 °C) than the recorded optimum of 25 °C. In a preliminary experiment, the temperature of 35 °C was also tested, but was subsequently excluded, because all eggs were dehy-drated. The eggs placed at 30 °C hatched, but at a considerably lower rate compared with the control eggs. This temperature re-sulted in faster larval and overall development compared with the control temperature. Adult weight and reproductive parameters were adversely affected at 30 °C. In particular, fecundity and fertility were dramatically lower for the females reared and maintained at 30 °C. The higher temperature tested had thus an overall negative impact on H. axyridis development and performance. A second experiment was designed to test the effects of a pyrethroid insecticide (λ-Cyhalothrin) on H. axyridis in comparison with Adalia bipunctata (L.), a species commonly found in Europe. Larval mortality suggested that H. axyridis was less susceptible than A. bipunctata to λ-Cyhalothrin.

40|$|Abstract. The Multicoloured <b>Asian</b> <b>Ladybird,</b> Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) {{is known}} to thrive principally in shrubby and {{arboreal}} habitats. This study focuses on the occurrence of this exotic species and its seasonal abundance in various field crops. The abundance of adults, larvae and pupae of H. axyridis was evaluated over a three-year period, from 2009 to 2011, in four important agronomical crops (wheat, corn, broad bean and potato) in Belgium. From May to September, 48 1 -m² quadrats were visually inspected {{in each of the}} fields sampled on several farms every seven days. H. axyridis colonized and reproduced in all of the four crops studied, with the largest numbers recorded in corn and broad bean crops. Larvae and adults of H. axyridis were recorded mainly in corn and to a much less extent in wheat and potato crops. From 2009 to 2011, the mean weekly abundance of H. ayxridis remained constant except in corn crops, where the recorded densities of all the immature stages and adults were higher in 2011 than in 2009. The population dynamics of aphids and H. axyridis are well described by a symmetric logistic function (S-shape) of cumulative population size.

40|$|The Multicoloured <b>Asian</b> <b>Ladybird,</b> Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) {{is known}} to thrive principally in shrubby and {{arboreal}} habitats. Its occurrence in agroecosystems remains poorly documented. This study focuses on the occurrence of this exotic species and its seasonal abundance in various field crops. The abundance of adults and larvae of H. axyridis was evaluated over a four-year period, from 2009 to 2012, in four important agronomical crops (wheat, corn, broad bean and potato) in Belgium. A total of 28 aphid predator species were observed including 14 coccinellid species, 13 hoverfly species and one lacewing species. H. axyridis is present and reproduces {{in all of the}} four crops studied, with the largest numbers recorded in corn and broad bean crops. In corn, H. axyridis numbers were found to increase over the four inventoried year, reaching 86 % of the aphid predators in 2012, while it represented only 15 % in 2009. H. axyridis was not always recorded where aphids were abundant, e. g. aphids were abundant on wheat where no H. axyridis were recorded. H. axyridis starts reproducing after the peak in aphid population, suggesting that H. axyridis is able to complete its development by feeding on alternative prey such as larvae and pupae of the same and other species of ladybird and other aphidophagous species. H. axyridis is often considered to be bivoltine but it only completes one generation per year in field crops. The second generation generally develops late in the season in other habitats. Harmonia axyridis is an invasive and an intraguild predator present in high quantities in some specific crops.

40|$|Several insect {{species are}} known to have {{different}} morphotypes, an adaptation to heterogeneities in changing environments. This phenotypic plasticity could be a factor used by the Multicoloured <b>Asian</b> <b>Ladybird,</b> which is considered as an invasive species in Europe since its introduction in the 80 ’s. Harmonia axyridis has four major morphotypes: 2 melanic forms, conspicua and spectabilis; and 2 non-melanic, succinea and axyridis. In Belgium, only the three first are observed. Literature reports variations in morphotype frequencies, across native and introduced strains. These variations seem to be linked to climate (geographical and seasonal variation), with non-melanic forms being the most abundant in hot and arid climate. This study focused on the variation of morphotype abundance in H. axyridis according to season, field and gender. Adult ladybirds were caught from mid-July to mid-October 2012 into 5 corn fields. The proportions of observed morphotypes were compared according to the sampling season. The abundance of morphotypes was not significantly different through the fields; the observed ratios were 81. 6 %, 15 % and 3. 4 % for succinea, spectabilis and conspicua respectively. Succinea was the most observed morphotype (χ 2 = 755. 8; P< 0. 001). The total number of collected males and females was the same with ratios of 48. 2 % and 51. 8 %: (χ 2 = 0. 93; P= 0. 33). The sex ratio was also not significantly different for each morphotype. There was no evolution of melanic and non-melanic form ratio according to the season, with 25. 6 % of melanic form in summer and 20. 6 % in autumn (χ 2 = 1. 22; P= 0. 27). Our results seem to show that morphotype adaptation according to the climate is not observed for Belgian ladybirds. We discuss these results according to all environmental data available.

40|$|Semiochemicals – {{informative}} molecules used in insect-insect or plant-insect interactions – {{have been}} widely considered within various integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. In the present thesis, two sesquiterpenoids, E-β-farnesene and E-β-caryophyllene, were formulated for their related properties as aphid enemy attractants. E-β-farnesene, the alarm pheromone of many aphid species, was also identified as a kairomone by attracting and inducing oviposition of aphid predators (Episyrphus balteatus De Geer (Diptera: Syrphidae)) and by attracting aphid parasitoids (Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)). E-β-caryophyllene {{was identified as a}} potential component of the aggregation pheromone of the <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird,</b> Harmonia axyridis Pallas, another aphid predator. The two products were purified from essential oils of Matricaria chamomilla L. (Asteraceae) and Nepeta cataria L. (Lamiaceae) for E-β-farnesene and E-β-caryophyllene, respectively. Natural and biodegradable slow-release formulations were then investigated in order to deliver these molecules on crop fields {{for a long period of}} time as biological control devices. Due to their sensitivity to oxidation, both sesquiterpenes needed to be protected from oxygen degradation. For this purpose, alginate – hydrophilic matrix with low oxygen permeability – was used as polymer for the formulations: the main objective was to deliver semiochemical substances in the air in a controlled way. Consequently, a careful selection of alginates was realised. Formulated beads showed different structural and encapsulation properties depending on various formulation factors. Alginate formulations were characterized by texturometry and by confocal microscopy in order to observe the distribution of semiochemicals in alginate network. The last step of alginate bead characterisation consisted in studying release rate of semiochemicals in laboratory-controlled conditions by optimised trapping and validated Fast-GC procedures. Finally, the efficiency of formulations as aphid predator (Syrphidae) and parasitoids (A. ervi) attractants was demonstrated by field trapping and olfactometry experiments...|$|E
40|$|The multicoloured <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird</b> Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), {{previously}} {{introduced as}} a {{biological control agent}} against aphids, is now frequently considered as an intraguild predator, consuming other aphid natural enemies. Interactions between this exotic ladybird and other aphidophagous species present in Belgian agro-ecosystems such as Coccinella septempunctata, Episyrphus balteatus and Chrysoperla carnea are asymmetric {{to the benefit of}} H. axyridis. This study focuses on the survival rate of three aphidophagous species Harmonia axyridis (Ha), Coccinella septempunctata (C 7) and Episyrphus balteatus (Eb) placed in cages in biological fields of potato and sugar beet. During June and July, hermetic cages were disposed on the crops with 10 larvae (second stage) of each aphidophagous. Four types of cages were observed (1) Ha+Eb+C 7 + aphids, (2) Ha+Eb+C 7, (3) Eb+C 7 + aphids and (4) Eb+C 7. Each combination was repeated three times. In sugar beet fields, E. balteatus was the species with the highest mortality rate. The two coccinellid species had a better survival rate than E. balteatus. All aphidophagous species had higher mortality rates in absence of aphids. In potato, when aphids were present in excess, the survival rates of all aphidophagous insects were lower than in sugar beet probably because A. fabae is less adapted to the potato morphology. Nevertheless, we have observed in potato no mortality of C. 7 -punctata during all its development cycle. This suggests that (1) C. 7 -punctata may use aphids as food sources more efficiently than H. axyridis and (2) that interactions between aphidophagous could be less frequent (difficulty of mobility). In potato and sugar beet, H. axyridis had the longest development cycle, being still at the larval stage when C. 7 -punctata and E. balteatus reached the pupae stage. We can suppose that pupae of E. balteatus and C. 7 -punctata were an alternative food (intraguild prey) to H. axyridis when aphids were lacking. Pupae are immobile and therefore more sensitive to the attack of predators. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{community}} of aphidophagous species present in agroecosystems is disturbed since {{the introduction of}} an exotic species the Multicoloured <b>Asian</b> <b>Ladybird,</b> Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). In this intensive agricultural area, five aphids predator species are commonly observed: three coccinellids H. axyridis, Coccinella septempunctata, Propylea quatuordecimpunctata, one hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus, and one lacewing Chrysoperla carnea. This study focuses on the occurrence of the five most abundant aphid predators and their seasonal abundance in corn. The abundance of adults and larvae of these species was evaluated over a five-year period, from 2009 to 2013. The sampling method consisted in the counting of aphids and all developmental stages of aphidophages present in quadrats of 1 m² from April to November. Densities of aphid predators changed during five years studies. Since 2011, H. axyridis was the most abundant aphids predators in corn. H. axyridis numbers were found to increase over the first four inventoried year, reaching in 2012 86 % for adult stage (119, 7 ± 7, 8 adults/ 100 m 2) and 76 % for larvae stages (242, 8 ± 14, 2 larvae/ 100 m 2) of the aphid predators, while in 2009 these ratios were 14 % and 23 % respectively. For C. septempunctata and P. quatuordecimpunctata the population densities decrease {{at the end of}} the five years period. Population densities of C. carnea and E. balteatus were variable during the sampling period but increased in 2013. Phenology of the five studied species presents similar curves following the aphid abundance. The most abundant observed aphids were metopolophium dirhodum, rhopalosiphum padi, rhopalosiphum maidis, sitobion avenae and sitobion fragariae. H. axyridis starts reproducing after the peak in aphid population, suggesting that H. axyridis is able to complete its development by feeding on alternative prey such as larvae and pupae of conspecific and heterospecific. H. axyridis is a bivoltine species but the second generation was stop by the corn harvesting. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the presence of links between chemical defences and warning signals presented by Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), the multicoloured <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird</b> (Insects: Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). This second part describes an original quantification method for 2 -isopropyl- 3 -methoxypyrazine (IPMP) by active sampling on thermally desorbed adsorbent (TD) coupled with GC-MS analysis. This highly odorous compound is supposed to be implicated in intra- and interspecific communication. In order to allow harmonine quantification (a defence alkaloid, see Part 1), this method avoid any hemolymph loses by the ladybird (Coccinellids can emit hemolymph when stressed). This method is non-lethal and applicable on one single insect. The quantification method has been validated from 37, 5 pg to 10 000 pg per adsorbent cartridge. On this range, there is no breakthrough and desorption is complete (> 99. 4 %). At the LOQ (37. 5 pg/cartridge), the bias is of 20 %, but rapidly decreased to less than 5 % on the rest of the validated range (100 to 10 000 pg/cartridge). According to AOAC (2006) norm, this method is repeatable but not reproducible. The IPMP emission rate following a stress has been quantified on 80 H. axyridis grouped in four classes on basis of the morph type and the elytra hue. Males and females emission rates did not significantly differ. The mean emission rate is of 707 pg/ 4 h with an extremely high standard deviation of 1766 pg/ 4 h due to a great individual variability and a strongly asymmetric distribution of the results. These results and those of the harmonine and colour analysis have been statistically analyzed in order to show potential correlations between these factors. It seems that elytra colour is linked with the insect IPMP emission rate. Individuals with a melanic red colour presented IPMP emission rate significantly lower than other studied colours. The harmonine content does not seem linked to the pyrazine emission rate. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The interactions between this exotic ladybird and other aphidophagous species present in Belgian agro-ecosystems are mainly asymmetric in support of H. axyridis. An aphidophages sampling has been performed between 2009 and 2011 in four agrosystems such as broad bean, wheat, corn and potato. The sampling method consisted in the counting of aphids and all developmental stages of aphidophages present in quadrats of 1 m² from April to September. Harmonia axyridis, the invasive coccinellid, was mainly observed in broad bean (21. 84 ± 6. 30 individuals/ 100 m²) and corn (70. 83 ± 6. 60 individuals/ 100 m²) with other aphidophages such as Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer), Chrysoperla carnea sensus lato (Stephens), Coccinella septempunctata (Linné) and Propylea quatuordecimpunctata (Linné). In corn, our field data showed that immature stages and adults of H. axyridis were found throughout the summer. Adults were observed from mid-June {{to the beginning of}} September with two peaks, in the late June and in the beginning of August. The life history of larvae starts in late-June to the beginning of Augustus with only one peak (347. 91 ± 59. 99 individuals / 100 m²) in the beginning of July. The peak of H. axyridis arrives when no extraguild preys are present. At this moment, pupae of E. balteatus and C. septempunctata are the main food available to ensure the development of H. axyridis so that native aphidophages could be intraguild prey for H. axyridis. In the four crops, reproduction of H. axyridis starts after those of other aphidophages and so it does not benefit of available prey such as aphid: in corn and broad bean, C. septempunctata reproduce the first, in wheat it is E. balteatus and in potato it is C. carnea. That could be explained by several reasons: (1) H. axyridis reproduces firstly in arboreal habitats and after that comes in agrosystems, (2) the delay between aphidophage reproductions allows a reduction of interactions with other larvae during spring and therefore decrease mortality levels and (3) H. axyridis is able to use pollen as food substitute when no aphids are available.

40|$|These {{last few}} years, the multicoloured <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird,</b> Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Insects: Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), an {{invasive}} species, has swiftly {{spread out in}} Europe. This aposematic and highly polymorphic insect is problematic in several ways. It seems to outcompete native coccinellid species; they can group on fruits in vineyards and spoil wine when crushed with grapes; they can aggregate by hundreds in houses to winter. This study aims to investigate {{the relations between the}} chemical defences of H. axyridis and warning signals expressed by this bug. To achieve this goal, two original quantification methods of H. axyridis secondary metabolites have been undertaken. The first one allows Fast-GC quantifying harmonine, its main defence alkaloid. The other one permits to determine its emission rate of 2 -isopropyl- 3 -methoxypyrazine, a highly odorous compound probably involved in the communication between individuals and in the aposematism of this insect. This last point will be detailed in another poster. Firstly, a method of extraction, acetylation and purification of harmonine from H. axyridis has been devised to obtain a calibration standard because this molecule is not commercially available. The identity of the extracted compound has been confirmed by mass spectrometry and multidimensional NMR. The GC purity of this N,N-diacetylharmonine is of 100 %. During the experiments, its stability in acetone solution at 4 °C has been verified. Using this purified molecule, an original method of harmonine quantification has been developed by fast gas chromatography and validated using accuracy profile. The method has been validated for concentrations ranging from 28 µg/ml to more than 264 µg/ml, with a maximal error risk of 20 %. From about 100 µg/ml, peaks symmetry decreased, but did not influence the quantification. That accuracy profile validation has been compared with a more classical validation using AOAC (2006) norm, which confirmed the first validation. This method allows quantifying harmonine in one single insect. Harmonine has been quantified in 80 H. axyridis divided into four groups of at least 15 individuals on basis of the morph type and the elytra hue. Males and females harmonine contents did not significantly differ. The mean harmonine content was of 106. 6 µg/individual {{with a standard deviation of}} 80. 2 µg/individual. The results distribution obtained was not normal and a strong variability between individuals was observed, which explains the high standard deviation. These results and those of the pyrazine and colour analysis have been statistically analyzed in order to show potential correlations between these factors. It would appear that elytra colour is linked with the insect harmonine content. Individuals with a non-melanic orange colour presented harmonine content significantly higher than other studied colours. The harmonine content does not seem linked to the pyrazine emission rate.

40|$|Abstract of {{the thesis}} {{entitled}} “Harmonia axyridis: {{how to explain}} its invasion success in Europe” After introduction as biological control agent of aphids, the multicoloured <b>Asian</b> <b>ladybird</b> Harmonia axyridis has established and spread in Europe. Harmonia axyridis is now regarded as an invasive species because its establishment had negative effects on non-target species, fruit production, and human health. Life history characteristics were studied {{in order to find}} an explanation for its invasion success. With a meta-analysis I showed that life-history traits of H. axyridis differed between Asian and invasive populations of H. axyridis. However, the greatest differences in development rate were observed at temperatures above 24 °C, while at temperatures characteristic for spring and summer in northwestern Europe (17 to 24 °C) invasive populations of H. axyridis do not differ from native Asian populations; thus, the invasive success cannot be attributed to a change in life history characteristics of the invasive population. Compared to native species European ladybirds (Adalia bipunctata, Coccinella septempunctata, and Propylea quatuordecimpunctata), H. axyridis develops slower and starts reproduction later, suggesting no competitive advantage for the invader. Additionally, life history characteristics were studied under field conditions. I showed that in northwestern Europe H. axyridis has a period of real diapause starting at the end of October and shifts to a quiescent state in December. This diapause is relatively short and weak compared with published data of native ladybirds. Moreover, it appears to have become shorter over the last decade. Thus, H. axyridis can become active rapidly when temperature rises in spring, but, nevertheless, it is not reported to be active earlier in the year than native species. Overwintering survival of H. axyridis in the Netherlands is between 71 and 88 %. At five sample sites I found that ladybirds that were hibernating at the southwestern sides of buildings, where most aggregations of ladybirds were found, had a higher winter survival than ladybirds hibernating at other orientations. At sheltered sites survival was higher compared to exposed sites. A high overwintering survival results in a large post-hibernation population and a rapid population build-up in spring. Compared with most common native species, winter survival of H. axyridis is similar or higher. In this research, i. e. under semi-field conditions, immature survival of H. axyridis and A. bipunctata reached high levels, but survival was generally considerably higher for H. axyridis than for the native A. bipunc­tata. Under semi-field conditions with high food availability, no effect of the presence of H. axyridis on the survival, development, weight, and size of the native species A. bipunctata was found. Under natural conditions, however, situations of prey scarcity do occur, as aphid colonies are relatively short-lived. Additionally, I demonstrated that in absence of food under semi-field conditions, intraguild predation between C. septempunctata, A. bipunctata, and H. axyridis does occur, although the contact frequency is low. When two fourth instar larvae were placed together on a single leaf, at least one contact was made in 23 – 43 % of the observations, depending on the tested species combination. When contacts between ladybirds do occur, H. axyridis larvae are the winners in contacts with larvae of the native species. Finally, I found that several natural enemies are starting to use H. axyridis as a host but are as yet not sufficiently abundant and/or effective to have a profound impact on populations of the invader. In the years 2003 — 2007 no natural enemies were found in ladybird samples. From 2008 onwards H. axyridis adults were infested by: Hesperomyces virescens fungi (summer and winter), Parasitylenchus bifurcatus nematodes (winter), Coccipolipus hippodamiae mites (winter), and Dinocampus coccinellae parasitoids (summer and winter). Summarising, the success­ful invasion of H. axyridis in the Netherlands cannot be explained by a change of the invasive H. axyridis populations in comparison with the native Asian population, but by a combi­nation of several characteristics: overwintering, immature survival, fecundity, longevity, number of generations per year, and intraguild predation. In comparison with native European ladybird species, H. axyridis survives better (in winter and the immature stages), it lays more eggs, has more generations per year, and lives longer: this results in a faster population growth than that of native ladybirds. Harmonia axyridis can potentially easily outnumber native species within a few years. Moreover, H. axyridis being a strong intra­guild predator, the slow immature development and late arrival at aphid colonies com­pared to native species is compensated by the ability of H. axyridis to feed on eggs, larvae, and pupae of other ladybirds, thereby completing its development. However, several facts, e. g. the quite stable diversity and abundance of ladybird species in Asia and the first evidence that natural enemies attack H. axyridis, suggest that the current situation in Europe may not be the terminal stage, but a transition to a new balance where native species are strongly reduced in abundance, but do not become extinct...|$|E
