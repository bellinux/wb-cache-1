5|$|In 1936–37, with Bradman back in {{the team}} as captain, Fingleton made a century in the First Test {{to become the first}} player to score {{consecutive}} centuries in four Test innings. He then made 136 in the Third Test, featuring in a partnership of 346 with Bradman after Australia had lost the first two Tests; their stand set up victory and Australia came back to win the series 3–2.

5|$|Producer Frank Marshall {{stated in}} 2003 {{that the film}} would use {{traditional}} stunt work {{so as to be}} consistent with the previous films. CGI was used to remove the visible safety wires on the actors when they did their stunts (such as when Indy swings on a lamp with his whip). Timed explosives were used for a scene where Indiana drives a truck through crates. During the take, an explosive failed to detonate and landed in the seat beside Ford. It did not go off <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> injured.|$|E
50|$|But {{this does}} not portray {{anything}} exactly like zoomorphism. Holy Spirit is seen like a dove <b>and</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a dove. The Holy Spirit was seen (seemed to them) like a dove.|$|R
25|$|His {{legacy of}} valor was later {{used by the}} Nazi Party for {{propaganda}} purposes. For this reason, streets named after him have <b>been</b> renamed <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> honored in memoriam in his hometown.|$|R
50|$|Gordon (2005) {{reports the}} other last native {{speakers}} of Catawba died before 1960. There are claims that Red Thunder Cloud is apparently an impostor <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> really a native speaker of Catawban.|$|R
5|$|The Cincinnati Bengals' {{starting}} quarterback, Andy Dalton, {{suffered a}} thumb injury in week 14, and the team's backup, AJ McCarron injured his wrist in week 16, leaving {{the team with}} one fully healthy quarterback on the roster, third-stringer Keith Wenning. The team signed Kafka to their practice squad on December 29, 2015, one week after his release from the Titans. After the Bengals were defeated {{in the first round}} of the 2015–16 NFL playoffs, his practice squad contract with the team expired <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> re-signed.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact with}} the fire {{extinguisher}} wrenched Pryce's helmet upward sharply. Death was almost certainly instantaneous. Pryce's Shadow DN8, now with its driver dead at the wheel, continued at speed down the main straight towards the first corner, called Crowthorne. The car left the track to the right, scraping the metal barriers, hitting an entrance for emergency vehicles, and veering back onto the track. It then hit Jacques Laffite's Ligier, sending both Pryce and Laffite head-on into the barriers. Jansen van Vuuren's injuries were so extensive that, initially, his body was identified only after the race director had summoned all of the race marshals <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> among them.|$|E
50|$|Champier added a codicil to {{his last}} wills in May 1539, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> noticed in any {{document}} after this date, so historians {{believe that he}} died {{in the second part of}} 1539.|$|R

5|$|The {{main problem}} for American breeders was the {{presence}} of the blood of Lexington in their breeding programs. Lexington's pedigree on his dam's side was suspect in the eyes of British racing authorities, and as he had been the leading sire of racehorses in the United States for 16years, his descendants were numerous. Most American-bred Thoroughbreds traced to Lexington at least once, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the only horse with suspect bloodlines registered in the American Stud Book.|$|E
5|$|The {{obligations}} and offices {{that came with}} {{being one of the}} largest local landowners descended on Mason as they had on his father and grandfather. In 1747, he was named to the Fairfax County Court. Mason was elected as a vestryman for Truro Parish, serving 1749–1785. He took a position among the officers of the county militia, eventually rising to the rank of colonel. In 1748, he sought a seat in the House of Burgesses; the process was controlled by more senior members of the court <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> then successful, but he would win in 1758.|$|E
5|$|Weir {{enlisted in}} the {{part-time}} South Australian Volunteer Military Force in March 1885, joining the 1st Battalion, Adelaide Rifles, as a private.

When the South African War broke out he volunteered for service with the South Australian Bushmen's Corps, but mounted officers were preferred, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> selected.|$|E
50|$|Ackaratorn Chularat, {{president}} of the Supreme Administrative Court, was always considered unlikely to be named interim prime minister because his knowledge of economics is regarded as limited, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> widely known in the international community.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> the Accrington Stanley goalkeeper in {{all their}} games in the 1961-62 season, but {{following}} their resignation from the league, their results <b>were</b> expunged <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> shown officially to have played any league games for them.|$|R
50|$|Calgacus <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{mentioned}} {{during or}} after the battle <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> named {{as one of the}} hostages Agricola took with him after putting the Caledonians to flight. Both Calgacus and the speech may be figments of Tacitus's invention.|$|R
5|$|At the 1872 Democratic National Convention, Stevenson {{received}} {{the votes of}} Delaware's six delegates for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination, although Benjamin Gratz Brown was ultimately nominated. In February 1873, Vice-President Schuyler Colfax named Stevenson as one of {{five members of the}} Morrill Commission to investigate New Hampshire Senator James W. Patterson's involvement in the Crédit Mobilier of America scandal. Stevenson and fellow Senator John P. Stockton of New Jersey both asked to be removed from the commission, but the Senate refused to grant their request. On February 27, 1873, the commission recommended Patterson's expulsion from the Senate, but the chamber adjourned on March 4 without acting on the recommendation. Patterson's term ended {{with the end of the}} session, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> re-elected, rendering moot further consideration of the matter.|$|E
5|$|Baggio was {{initially}} a regular squad member under Dino Zoff, appearing {{as a substitute}} in two Euro 2000 qualifying matches, in a 2–0 win against Wales in 1998, setting up a goal for Vieri; and in a 1–1 draw against Belarus in 1999. Baggio made a starting appearance in a 0–0 friendly draw against Norway in 1999, creating several chances, helping to set-up a goal which was ruled offside, and hitting the post from a free-kick. However, he was later dropped from the squad after Inter's poor 1998–99 season, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> called up for the Euro 2000 finals due to his limited playing time during the 1999–2000 season, and accusations made against his fitness. Zoff centred his squad around younger offensive players, such as Francesco Totti, Alessandro Del Piero, Stefano Fiore, Marco Delvecchio, Filippo Inzaghi and Vincenzo Montella. Baggio was voted Italy's Player of the Century in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Charles Edward Greene {{was born}} September 24, 1946, in Temple, Texas. He played high school {{football}} at Dunbar High School in Temple. Despite Greene's talents, the Dunbar Panthers had a mediocre record, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> heavily recruited by colleges. His options were limited further due to segregation of the Southwest Conference. He was eventually offered a scholarship to play college football at North Texas State University (now University of North Texas), where he played on the varsity team from 1966 to 1968. He led the team to a 23–5–1 record during his three seasons. In his 29 games at defensive tackle, North Texas State held the opposition to 2,507 yards gained on 1,276 rushes, a per-carry average of less than two yards. Greene was a three-time All-Missouri Valley Conference selection.|$|E

Adams' brother, Joel C. Adams, is a vice-president of Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, Inc., a related corporation.|$|R
50|$|He died in London in 1808 and {{was buried}} in Old St. Pancras Churchyard. The grave is lost (and was {{possibly}} unmarked even from the beginning) <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> listed on the Burdett-Coutts Memorial to the famous graves lost, which stands in the churchyard.|$|R
