50|$|Today, the CCATT is a three-person, highly {{specialized}} medical asset that can create and operate a portable {{intensive care unit}} (ICU) on board any transport aircraft during flight. It is a limited, rapidly deployable resource and a primary component of the Air Force's <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> (AE) <b>system.</b> The CCATT team consists of a physician specializing in an area such as critical care, emergency medicine, anesthesiology, surgery, etc., along with a critical care nurse and a respiratory therapist. The CCATT, with special medical equipment, can turn almost any airframe into a flying intensive care unit within minutes. The team is experienced {{in the care of}} critically ill or injured patients with multi-system trauma, shock, burns, respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, or other life-threatening complications. The complex, critical nature of patients in hemodynamic flux requires continual stabilization, advanced care, and may even require life-saving invasive interventions during transport.|$|R

5000|$|... 1990s era [...] Aerospace medicine’s {{support and}} {{development}} of critical care in the air marked its first major milestone in 1997 with the USAFSAM’s inception of the Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) program that integrated Air Force aeromedical operations worldwide. CCATT was created {{in response to a}} shift in Air Force aeromedical evacuation doctrine following the first Persian Gulf War. The shift involving patient care from “return to duty” to “evacuate and replace” provided the impetus for CCATT’s development as a training program that emphasized stabilizing patients in the <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>system.</b> CCATT’s development has since expanded the Air Force’s aeromedical clinical transport capabilities by providing intensive care unit support on board transport aircraft.|$|E
50|$|With the re-alignment to MATS, Aeromedical {{evacuation}} {{continued to}} grow and in 1964, Scott's host wing was re-designated as the 1405th Aeromedical Transport Wing. Increasing importance placed on airlift and {{the decision by the}} Navy to set up its own transport command led to the Military Air Transport Service being re-designated as Military Airlift Command (MAC) in 1966. Associated with this reorganization, the 1405th was discontinued and its mission and resources were absorbed by the newly activated AFCON 375th Aeromedical Airlift Wing. The addition of a fleet of C-9A Nightingales in 1968 further expanded the 375th's aeromedical mission. In 1973, Scott's Patient Airlift Center coordinated 61 aeromedical missions to bring 357 former Vietnam War Prisoners of War back to the United States. In June 1973, the 1400th Air Base Wing inactivated, the 375th Air Base Group (today the 375th Mission Support Group) reactivated, and host wing responsibilities reverted to the 375th Aeromedical Airlift Wing. By 1975, the 375th gained responsibility for the worldwide <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Korean War {{played a}} great role in {{defining}} MASH units. High {{casualties in the}} front line called for onsite paramedic care, such as ambulances and medical tents. Having learned from World War II that transporting wounded soldiers to rear hospitals was highly inefficient in reducing mortality rate, MASH units were established near front lines to supply mobile and flexible military medical care. They contributed to making improvements in resuscitation and trauma care, patient transport, blood storage and distribution, patient triage, and evacuation. <b>Aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>system</b> was developed to transport soldiers by unnoisy air crafts at a quicker pace. Helicopters were frequently used as [...] "air ambulances" [...] during Korean War. The Bell H-13 was a dominant medical evacuation aircraft during the war. Military doctors stabilized wounded soldiers midair, before getting them to field hospital. MASH onsite paramedic care and air ambulance system decreased post evacuation mortality by 37.5%, from 4.0% in World War II to 2.5% in Korean War.|$|E
50|$|The 1st <b>Aeromedical</b> <b>Evacuation</b> Squadron was {{a unit of}} the United States Air Force. It was {{activated}} on 1 July 1975 {{when the}} 1st <b>Aeromedical</b> <b>Evacuation</b> Group was inactivated.

40|$|Effective <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> of {{casualties}} {{is one of}} the most important problems in military medical systems because high-priority casualties will not survive without timely medical care. The decision making process for <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> consists of the following components: (1) identifying which <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> asset (see figure 1) to dispatch to the casualty, (2) locating <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> assets strategically in anticipation of incoming demand, and (3) deciding which medical treatment facility to transport the casualty. These decisions are further complicated because prioritization {{of casualties}} is based on severity of injury while <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> assets and medical treatment facilities operate with varying capabilities. In this dissertation, discrete optimization models are developed to examine dispatch, delivery, and location logistics for the effective <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> of casualties in military medical systems...|$|R
50|$|In 1965, the 1st <b>Aeromedical</b> <b>Evacuation</b> Group {{responded to}} the Dominican Republic Crisis by mobilizing a {{tactical}} aeromedical system. Hundreds of patients were safely evacuated to the United States. Part of the 21st <b>Aeromedical</b> <b>Evacuation</b> Squadron deployed to Vietnam in February 1967 in direct support of the 903d <b>Aeromedical</b> <b>Evacuation</b> Flight.|$|R
50|$|It airlifted {{more than}} 700 VA {{hospital}} patients from Biloxi and Gulfport, Mississippi, to safety during Hurricane Camille in August 1969; during Project Homecoming in early 1973 the wing flew 119 sorties to airlift some 350 U.S. {{prisoners of war}} to 26 hospitals in the United States. In October 1973, it served as an aeromedical evacuation center established under wing control at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, assumed the functions previously handled by smaller centers at Scott, McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, and Travis Air Force Base, California. In April 1975, when the aeromedical evacuation support units in Germany and the Far East came under 375th control, the wing became the single-point manager for worldwide DoD aeromedical evacuation services. It evacuated wounded during the invasion of Grenada, 24 October-9 November 1983. It transported 350 wounded Afghan citizens to hospitals in the United States, May-December 1987. It controlled a Facility Checking Squadron from October 1987-September 1991, which inspected DoD navigation aids and radar facilities worldwide. The wing operated and maintained an <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>system</b> on a rotational basis in Southwest Asia, September 1990-April 1991. It deployed an aeromedical evacuation element to support Operation Allied Force in 1999.|$|E
40|$|The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) is a {{partnership}} {{of private and}} public sectors to provide care {{to the victims of}} great disasters. The system is being developed as a voluntary cooperative effort of four major Federal agencies, State and local governments, and the American professional and hospital communities. A medical response component will include 150 disaster medical assistance units capable of clearing or staging operations in a disaster. Each unit will comprise three 29 -person teams containing physicians, nurses, medical technicians, and support personnel and will include a 16 -person unit command and support element. An evacuation component will be founded on the military <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>system,</b> augmented by civilian aircraft and other transportation resources. A hospital component will enroll 100, 000 pre-committed beds in hospitals throughout the nation. The system is designed to care for up to 100, 000 casualties arising from a massive peacetime disaster or an overseas conventional military conflict. The National Disaster Medical System will be implemented over a period of 3 to 5 years. The authors recommend that all parts of the American health care community join in support of the system...|$|E
40|$|During {{the latter}} half of 1990 the Royal Air Force {{established}} a medical evacuation chain in support of the British First Armoured Division during Operation Granby (known as Operation Desert Storm in the USA). Medical contingency plans, formulated prior to embarkation from the UK, foresaw the need for five aeromedical staging facilities sub-deployed throughout the east of the Arabian Peninsula. The early days of the deployment found personnel busy with the construction of tented and hardened facilities and with the establishment of local operating procedures. Many problems were initially encountered, especially with supply, communications and in co-ordinating with collaborating coalition and host nation units. Nevertheless, progress was rapid and non-combatant operations were started within days of arrival. As the ground offensive became more imminent, training took on a sense of urgency. Advanced first aid techniques were taught to all non-medical staff, whereas doctors, nurses and paramedical personnel were taught ACLS and ATLS skills. All studied field hygiene, the hazards of nuclear, chemical and biological warfare, casualty handling, battle psychology and the intricacies of loading and unloading various types of aircraft. By the start of the ground phase of the war the British evacuation chain was fully operational and capable of treating and transferring hundreds of casualties per day. In the event, only about 850 patients were transported down the evacuation chain during the conflict, and less than 10 % of these were battle casualties. This paper presents an overview of the British <b>aeromedical</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>system</b> and discusses, in more detail, the establishment and operation of the busiest aeromedical staging facility at Al Jubail in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia...|$|E

U. S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is the DoD agency responsible for evacuating patients during wartime and peace. Doctrinally, patients requiring extended treatment must be evacuated by air to a suitable Medical Treatment Facility (MTF). The Persian Gulf war was the first significant armed conflict in which this concept has been put to a serious test.
