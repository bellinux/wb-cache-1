50|$|In 1985, Air India Flight 182 {{flying from}} Canada was blown up by a bomb while in Irish airspace, killing 329 people, {{including}} 280 Canadian citizens, mostly of Indian birth or descent, and 22 Indians. The incident was the deadliest act of <b>air</b> <b>terrorism</b> before 9/11, {{and the first}} bombing of a 747 Jumbo Jet which would set a pattern for future <b>air</b> <b>terrorism</b> plots. The crash occurred {{within an hour of}} the fatal Narita Airport Bombing which also originated from Canada without the passenger for the bag that exploded on the ground. Evidence from the explosions, witnesses and wiretaps of militants pointed to an attempt to actually blow up two airliners simultaneously by members of the Babbar Khalsa Khalistan movement militant group based in Canada to punish India for attacking the Golden Temple.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses two questions: what determines U. S. {{news media}} coverage of fatal airplane accidents, {{and what is the}} effect of coverage and of media representations on the number of passengers who fly. It builds on theories of risk and theories of media effects integrating the concept of signal value and exploring how the news media react to a class of risks and generate processes of social amplification of risks in the population. Analyses combined content analyses of the amount and nature of Associated Press (AP) and television coverage of fatal accidents with government data about accidents and enplanements over the period from 1978 to August 2001. ^ Findings suggest that news media attention to fatal accidents is a function of signal value components. Fatalities, carrier type, accident location, the intensity of media representations of accidents as <b>air</b> <b>terrorism,</b> and as mysterious, as well as the density of past accidents—generate coverage independently, but also in complex interactions. Fatalities is the strongest predictor of coverage. The full models accounted for 70 % and 62 % of the variance in AP and television news coverage, respectively. Some components—fatalities, carrier type, and representations of air terrorism—reinforce each other, generating spiraling amplification in coverage. Regarding the issue of time-concentrated reactions to risks, accidents occurring in periods dense in accidents have a higher likelihood of being selected for television coverage. However, they reduce the positive effect of fatalities and of links to <b>air</b> <b>terrorism</b> on coverage, perhaps because of disaster fatigue or competition for a limited news hole among the accidents covered. ^ Addressing the media effects question, time-series analyses produced some evidence that air travel behavior responds inversely to the volume of media coverage. Media influence is non-linear: behavior tracks coverage inversely only after a threshold is reached and levels off at high levels of coverage. Furthermore, coverage effects are also contingent on monthly fatalities, density of accidents and media representations of accidents as the result of <b>air</b> <b>terrorism.</b> The latter interaction strengthens claims about a media effect on behavior resulting from the combined effect of volume of coverage and media representations. ...|$|E

40|$|Unlawful {{interference}} with civil aviation {{has become a}} major concern for the world aviation community. The misuse of aircraft as {{a weapon of mass destruction}} has created new challenges. <b>Air</b> <b>terrorism</b> has moved from hijacking or unlawful seizure of aircraft to an in-flight explosion caused by sabotage and finally to September 11, 2001, to the use of a civil airplane as a weapon of destruction. The events of September may be the biggest security challenge ever faced by the aviation industry. The impact of this tragic event on the global economy has been very harsh. The events have tended to obscure the fact that civil aviation continues to be an inherent safe mode of transport. Great efforts are being made at the national and international levels to create a security net which is global in nature and so tight that not one further potential act of unlawful interference can slip through. However, the fact remains that, in weaving the net and designing measures with the objectives of preventing, combating and eradicating acts of terrorism involving civil aviation, it is prudent to be imaginative in assessing the threat, which could come from new directions and in new forms. This thesis explores the implications of the 11 September 2001 events. A global strategy is initiated by ICAO and endorsed by the States, with the aim of protecting lives, restoring public confidence in air travel, and promoting the financial health of air transport. I will therefore examine the measures initiated by ICAO in response to the new challenges in aviation and which form the basis of the aviation security action plan. The perspective is that the events of 11 September have changed the world, and changed irrecoverably. Nothing will be the same for the aviation industry...|$|E

5000|$|BackpackersXpress had 14 {{staff members}} in May 2004, and was holding talks with Singapore Airlines about leasing {{aircraft}} and an unnamed British airline concerning {{funding for the}} venture. The company claimed that it would employ 400 people once flights commenced. At {{this time it was}} still not able to operate flights as it did not have an air operator's certificate. An industry expert interviewed by Bloomberg News was sceptical that the venture was viable given that the proponents did not have a track record in the aviation industry and the market for long-haul flights was highly competitive. In February 2004 a writer in The Times stated that [...] "It seems doubtful to any sane observer ... whether the project will ever get off the ground", and that the plan to encourage a [...] "party in the sky" [...] was [...] "a radical move" [...] given the concerns over <b>air</b> rage and <b>terrorism.</b>|$|R
25|$|The NZ Police are {{accountable}} for the operational response to threats to national security, including terrorism. If an incident escalates to a level where their internal resources are unable to adequately {{deal with the issue}} (for example, a major arms encounter or a significant terrorist threat), the Police Incident Controller may call on extra assistance from the New Zealand Defence Force and in particular NZ's Special Forces, the military focused New Zealand Special <b>Air</b> Service and <b>terrorism</b> focused Commando Squadron (D Squadron). Control of the incident remains with police throughout. As of 2009, the two military counter terrorist units have never been deployed in a domestic law-enforcement operation. Military resources such as Light Armoured Vehicles have been used and requested before, such as during the 2009 Napier shootings, and Royal New Zealand Air Force helicopters from No. 3 Squadron are often used to assist in search and rescue and cannabis eradication operations.|$|R
40|$|International audienceRisk is {{a concept}} used to {{describe}} future potential outcomes of certain actions or events. Within the project "CEDIM ? Risk Map Germany ? Man-made Hazards" {{it is intended to}} develop methods for assessing and mapping the risk due to different human-induced hazards. This is a task that has not been successfully performed for Germany so far. Concepts of catastrophe modelling are employed including the spatial modelling of hazard, the compilation of different kinds of exposed elements, the estimation of their vulnerability and the direct loss potential in terms of human life and health. The paper is divided in two sections: First, an analytic framework for assessing the broad spectrum of human-induced risks is introduced. This approach is then applied for three important types of human-induced hazards that are representative for a whole class of hazards: Accidents due to nuclear power plants (NPP) or <b>air</b> traffic, and <b>terrorism.</b> For the analysis of accidents, risk is measured with respect to getting injured or dying when living in certain buffer zones around hazard locations. NPP hazard expert knowledge is used and supplemented with observations on aging effects leading to a proprietary index value for the risk. Air traffic risk is modelled as an area related phenomenon based on available accident statistics leading to an expected value of risk. Terrorism risk is assessed by the attraction certain elements (like embassies in the case of conventional threats) display in the eye of potential aggressors. For non-conventional targets like football games, a detailed approach measuring their susceptibility to different kinds of attacks within predefined scenarios was developed; this also allows a ranking of attack modes...|$|R
40|$|This report {{covers the}} work {{completed}} during Year One (Year One has a 16 month project period) of a five- year Cooperative Agreement (DE-FC 26 - 03 NT 41895) between the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE) National Hazmat Program (OENHP) and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). This {{final technical report}} is being submitted, {{as required by the}} Cooperative Agreement, within 90 (calendar) days after the project period ends (December 31, 2004). The resources allocated to Year One of the Cooperative Agreement were adequate for the completion of the required deliverables. All deliverables have been completed and sent to AAD Document Control as directed in the cooperative agreement. The allocation for Year One required 20 - 25 trainers to be trained in each of five Train-the-Trainer courses and a total of 6, 000 workers trained throughout the country. Through cost savings employed for the scheduling and conduct of Train-the-Trainer, instructor refreshers, and direct training classes, 3171 workers have been trained to date. This total incorporates 159 trainers and members from management, local, county, state and federal organizations identified in the Strategic Plan. The largest percentage of personnel trained is heavy equipment operators, and building engineers, which is the largest targeted population identified under this cooperative agreement. The OENHP, using existing curriculum as appropriate, has modified and developed new training modules that have been used to establish four different levels of training courses. The four courses are: (1) EA 500 Energy Assurance Train-the-Trainer, (2) EA 400 Energy Assurance Instructor Refresher, (3) EA 300 Energy Assurance, and (4) EA 100 Energy Assurance Awareness. Training modules cover topics, such as, but not limited to, facility vulnerability and vulnerability assessment, physical security- heating, ventilation, <b>air</b> conditioning, <b>terrorism</b> awareness, weapons of mass destruction, respiratory protection, and decontamination. All of the courses and training modules are described in detail in the ''Training Course and Module Description Catalog'', April 2004. The OENHP has developed a Compendium of reference materials, training demonstration/hands-on models, and is revising its student manual. Course and instructor evaluations and the input of a general Advisory Board and an Advisory Board made up of Stationary (Building) Engineers has provided direction for modification and improvement of the Energy Security (Assurance) Training Program. The OENHP has identified the target training population, IUOE Stationary (Building) Engineers as being the primary population and IUOE heavy equipment operators as also being a targeted population. The OENHP however, has also identified several applicable populations outside of its membership, such as the Transport Workers Union and special populations within its membership, such as IUOE Local Union 25 Maritime Division. During Year One, a redesigned web site and brochures have been developed to assist in promotion of the energy security (assurance) program and the benefits of its training courses...|$|R
