50|$|Many of the Mount Baldy {{headwater}} streams {{that are}} the stronghold of <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> are entirely closed to fishing. Catch and release fishing opportunities for wild (stream born), pure-strain <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> exist in {{a limited number of}} areas.

50|$|Lee Valley Lake has 35 acre with {{a maximum}} depth of 20 ft and an average depth of 10 ft. It is located on Lee Valley Creek, an <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> {{recovery}} stream. The <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> is the Arizona state fish. The creek naturally flows into the East Fork of the Little Colorado River; however, the spillway directs overflow to the West Fork of the Little Colorado River. Both streams are also designated for <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> recovery, thus Lee Valley Lake finds itself {{at the heart of}} three <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> recovery streams and is managed accordingly.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{the main}} {{risk to the}} <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> is its easy {{hybridization}} with the rainbow trout and major forest fires. Cutthroat trout are also genetically similar and cross-breed with <b>Apache</b> <b>trout,</b> compromising the genetic purity of each species. The range of the <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> remains limited, which puts it at risk, but it is now common enough that limited fishing is permitted.|$|E
50|$|Recovery and {{management}} efforts for <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> have been ongoing since the 1940s. <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> are raised in {{federal and state}} hatcheries, and reared fish {{have been used to}} assist with recovery and to maintain populations for sport fishing in certain streams and reservoirs.|$|E

The <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> is native to the upper Salt River watershed (Black and White rivers) and the upper Little Colorado River watershed. <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> have been introduced into isolated streams outside of their historic range in the Pinaleno Mountains and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.|$|E
50|$|Mount Graham hosts both {{species of}} Arizona native trout--Gila and <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> and three species of {{introduced}} trout.|$|E
50|$|Gila trout have {{a yellow}} body, with black spots. The average total length is about 300.0 mm (11.8 in.); with {{maximum total length}} {{approximately}} 550.0 mm (21.7 in.).

50|$|The <b>Apache</b> <b>trout,</b> Oncorhynchus apache, is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} fish in the salmon family (family Salmonidae) of order Salmoniformes. It {{is one of the}} Pacific trouts.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> spawns from March to {{the middle}} of June, and varies with elevations. Maturity was found to occur in three years, and {{fecundity}} is based on the size of trout. One female typically produces from 72 to 240 eggs in 13.1 to 19.1 cm fish and from 646 to 1,083 eggs in 29.8 to 34.9 cm fish. The eggs hatch after 30 days. The <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> eats both terrestrial and aquatic insects, such as Trichoptera and Diptera. In lakes, they also eat small fishes and zooplankton.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> {{measures}} in length from 6 to 24 in, and weighs between 6 ounces and 6 lb. It rarely exceeds 25 cm, but can reach up to 40 cm in its native, headwater streams. <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> are a yellowish-gold color {{with a golden}} belly and have medium-sized dark spots that are evenly spaced and that may extend below the lateral line and onto the dorsal and tail fins. The top of its head and back are dark olive in color, {{and it has the}} appearance of having a black stripe/mask through each of its eyes, due to two small black dots {{on either side of the}} pupil. There can be a throat mark below the lower jaw, ranging in color from yellow to gold.|$|E
50|$|The East Fork Black River and West Fork Black River, which {{merge to}} form the mainstem, have populations of brown trout and <b>Apache</b> <b>trout.</b> The {{headwaters}} tributaries support many aquatic insects, including more than 30 species of caddisflies.

50|$|While the IUCN {{considers}} the <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> to be critically endangered, it {{is listed as}} threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Around 100 years ago, they {{could be found in}} 600 mi of streams in the White Mountains. By the late 1960s, their range had been reduced to around 30 mi of these streams.

40|$|In the summer, five creeks on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation were examined. <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> {{generally}} {{selected the}} deepest pools {{with the greatest}} amounts of instream cover and bankcuts. Though fish in three creeks may be <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> x rainbow trout hybrids, they were found to occupy {{the same type of}} pools. Regression models on environmental conditions in two creeks accounted for 83 % and 76 % of the variability in biomass of <b>Apache</b> <b>trout.</b> There was adequate nursery habitat (and successful reproduction) on two creeks, but such habitat was lacking in the other three creeks, and no evidence of successful reproduction was found. There was little evidence of survival of smaller <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> in areas of co-occurrence with non-native trouts but there was evidence of their survival upstream where fewer numbers of non-natives occur. The exclusion of smaller <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> may be from elimination or emigration. Greater populations of <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> may be supported through eradication of non-native trouts, the addition of instream cover, and structures designed to create longer lasting pools and bankcuts...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTâ€”Apache trout (Oncorhynchus gilae apache) are {{a federally}} {{threatened}} salmonid endemic to the White Mountains of east-central Arizona. Nonnative salmonids can prey on, compete with and hybridize with <b>Apache</b> <b>trout,</b> and have thus {{been identified as}} a major threat to this species. Emplacement of fish migration barriers (primarily of gabion construction) on selected streams {{is one of the major}} recovery actions being used to isolate and protect upstream populations from nonnative salmonids; however, the effectiveness of this recovery action has not been evaluated. We evaluated the success of constructed barriers at preventing the upstream movement of nonnative salmonids. We also evaluated if barriers affected <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> population characteristics by examining condition and size structure above and below barriers. We examined historical survey data from eight streams following pesticide treatment and re-stocking of <b>Apache</b> <b>trout,</b> to determine if non-native salmonids reinvaded. Sixty-four percent of the barriers failed to isolate <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> populations. We also marked 1, 436 salmonids downstream of barriers o...|$|E
40|$|Formerly Salmo apache {{historically}} inhabited {{streams in}} the White Mountains of east central AZ, including {{the headwaters of}} the Salt and Little Colorado rivers (Figure 1). Prior to {{the turn of the century}} the <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> was the only salmonid resident to streams originating in the White Mountains of east-central Arizona. Early settlers reported abundant populations of trout in pristine montane habitat. However, beginning in the late ` 19 th century, human interactions had a marked effect on populations. Grazing, logging, and other habitat impacts altered watersheds and were detrimental to the spring-spawning <b>Apache</b> <b>trout.</b> Their abundance also supplied a ready source of food for the early settlers.

40|$|In 1995, Squaw and Flash creeks were renovated with Antimycin-A to {{eradicate}} non-native fish. After renovation, 129 <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> from Flash Creek were introduced into Squaw Creek. Two years later, all size classes were present. <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> above a natural barrier on Flash Creek {{were allowed to}} repopulate the renovated section. Three years later, 45 <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> were found below the natural barrier. In both streams, adults selected deep, slow moving areas. Juveniles selected shallow areas with fast currents. Both size classes selected open areas exposed to sunlight with surface turbulence {{and other forms of}} instream cover. Apache and Gila trout were experimentally PIT-tagged in the: (1) pelvic girdle; (2) abdominal cavity; and (3) dorsal musculature to determine the best tagging location.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the regulation of}} the muscarinic cholinergic receptor (MChR) in brain from seven species of fish, two surrogates and five threatened or endangered species exposed {{to a series of}} chemicals as a measure of compensatory response among species. Fish were classified as either cold water (rainbow trout-surrogate, <b>apache</b> <b>trout,</b> lahanton trout) or warm water (fathead minnow-surrogate, razorback sucker, bonytail chub, colorado squawfish) and were exposed to chemicals shown to affect cholinergic pathways (carbaryl and permethrin) and two chemicals whose relationships to the cholinergic system is less clear (4 -nonylphenol and copper). Downregulation of MChR occurred in all warm water species, except Colorado squawfish, and at carbaryl concentrations similar to those causing down regulation observed in rainbow trout. Permethrin exposure resulted in down regulation in fathead minnow and razorback sucker, but the concentrations required for observation of this phenomenon were much greater than observed in cold water species. Copper exposure caused a decrease in brain MChR in rainbow trout and <b>apache</b> <b>trout,</b> whereas 4 -nonylphenol exposure resulted in a decrease in brain MChR in all three cold water species. Our results indicate that surrogates are useful in assessing sublethal physiological responses to chemicals with a known mechanism of action such as carbaryl and support use of surrogates for assessing physiological responses to chemicals with diverse, less clear mechanisms of action...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of chloramine-T was evaluated in 74 disease control/prevention trials during calender year (CY) 2001. Trials were conducted at six U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) hatcheries and one U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) facility to control mortality {{caused by the}} following fish diseases: (1) bacterial gill disease, (2) external columnaris, (3) furunculosis caused by Aeromonas salmonicida, or motile aeromonad disease caused by A. hydrophila. Fish species treated included: (1) yellow perch Perca flavescens, (2) <b>Apache</b> <b>trout</b> Oncorhynchus apache, (3) cutthroat trout O. clarki, (4) rainbow and steelhead trout O. mykiss, and (5) brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis.
