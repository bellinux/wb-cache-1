40|$|Signal of the DCF <b>amplitude-modulated</b> <b>transmitter,</b> {{located in}} Braunschweig (Germany) {{is widely used}} for {{synchronizing}} of time information during different laboratory and field experiments. The full time information of this time normal is coded and presented within every minute using different length of second time marks. The knowledge of the exact time of occurrence of seismic events is the fundamental information during the seismic activity monitoring. With respect {{to the fact that}} the duration of individual records having sometimes a few seconds at minimum, the time generator ensuring the complete time information within every second, is needed. That is why the special timing device controlled by the DCF 77 signal and generating every second the full time information was developed. Description of the function of decoder, internal clock and fast code generator implemented on the basis of FPGA circuits is the subject of this paper...|$|E
5000|$|A similar {{effect is}} {{occasionally}} {{observed in the}} vicinity of high-power <b>amplitude-modulated</b> radio <b>transmitters</b> when a corona discharge (inadvertently) occurs from the transmitting antenna, where voltages {{in the tens of thousands}} are involved. The ionized air is heated in direct relationship to the modulating signal with surprisingly high fidelity over a wide area. Due to the destructive effects of the (self-sustaining) discharge this cannot be permitted to persist, and automatic systems momentarily shut down transmission within a few seconds to quench the [...] "flame".|$|R
40|$|A {{case-control study}} of radio {{frequency}} electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and childhood leukemia was con-ducted in West Germany. The study region included municipalities near high-power radio and TV broadcast towers, including 16 amplitude-modulated and 8 frequency-modulated transmitters. Cases were aged 0 – 14 years, {{were diagnosed with}} leukemia between 1984 and 2003, and were registered at the German Childhood Cancer Registry. Three age-, gender-, and transmitter-area-matched controls per case were drawn randomly from pop-ulation registries. The analysis included 1, 959 cases and 5, 848 controls. Individual exposure to RF-EMFs 1 year before diagnosis was estimated with a field strength prediction program. Considering total RF-EMFs, the odds ratio derived from conditional logistic regression analysis {{for all types of}} leukemia was 0. 86 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 67, 1. 11) when upper (95 %/ 0. 701 V/m) and lower (< 90 %/ 0. 504 V/m) quantiles of the RF-EMF distribution were compared. An analysis of <b>amplitude-modulated</b> and frequency-modulated <b>transmitters</b> separately did not show increased risks of leukemia. The odds ratio for all types of leukemia was 1. 04 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 65, 1. 67) among children living within 2 km of the nearest broadcast transmitter compared with those living at a distance of 10 –< 15 km. The data did not show any elevated risks of childhood leukemia associated with RF-EMFs. child; electromagnetic fields; leukemia; radiation, radio; televisio...|$|R
