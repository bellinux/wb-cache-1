40|$|Ulcerative colitis (UC) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} condition that {{is confined to}} the colonic mucosa. Its main symptoms include diarrhea, rectal bleeding and abdominal pain. Approximately two-thirds of UC patients have disease confined distal to the splenic flexure, {{which can be treated}} effectively with topical therapy. This means the active drug can be delivered directly to the site of inflammation, limiting the systemic absorption and potential side effects. Topical treatment with <b>aminosalicylates</b> is the most effective approach in the treatment of these forms, provided that the formulation reaches the upper margin of the disease. Given this, the suppository formulation is the treatment of choice for proctitis and distal sigmoiditis. Thanks to their proximal spread, enemas, foams and gels represent the treatment of choice for proctosigmoiditis and for distal ulcerative colitis. Oral <b>aminosalicylates</b> are less effective than topical therapies in patients with active disease, while the combination of topical and oral treatment is more effective in patients refractory to topical or oral mono-therapy. Topically administered <b>aminosalicylates</b> {{play an important role in}} the maintenance of remission, but the long-term adhesion to therapy is poor.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the quality of}} care for a hospital based-cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from East China according to the current practice guidelines. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, involving 177 patients with IBD admitted to Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University between June 2000 and June 2006. Data regarding demographic and clinical characteristics as well as medical therapy including use of oral aminosalicylates, topical therapy, corticosteroid agents, immunomodulatory agents (such as azathioprine) at admission and outpatient clinic visit were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 177 eligible patients were evaluated in this study, including 71 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 106 with ulcerative colitis (UC). All were the Han nationality Chinese with active disease at baseline. All the 106 patients with ulcerative colitis received optimal doses of <b>aminosalicylate</b> while 27 of 68 (39. 7 %) patients with ileal or colonic CD received the suboptimal doses of <b>aminosalicylate.</b> The incidence of suboptimal dose of <b>aminosalicylate</b> was significantly higher in CD patients with small intestine involvement only (52. 8 % vs 25. 0 %, P = 0. 019). Thirty-one (54. 4 %) patients with active distal or left-sided ulcerative colitis received topical therapy, and 27. 8 % of patients suffering from severe inflammatory bowel disease did not receive oral or intravenous steroid therapy. Among the 51 patients for whom thiopurine was indicated, only 10 (19. 6 %) received immunomodulatory agents, {{and more than half of}} the 8 patients received a suboptimal dose of azathiopurine with no attempt to increase its dosage. CONCLUSION: The quality of care for IBD patients can be further improved. A suboptimal dose of <b>aminosalicylate</b> is used in treatment of patients with CD, especially in those with small intestine involved only. Topical mesalazine is inadequately used in patients with distal or left-sided colitis. Oral or intravenous steroid therapy is not used in some patients with severe IBD.

40|$|Introduction. Idiopathic {{ulcerative}} colitis (IUC) represents a rare disease of childhood. It usually occurs at age over 10 years, and below that exceptionally rarely. Objective. The {{aim of the}} paper was to analyze the clinical signs, symptoms and therapeutic procedures in children with IUC. Methods. The aims of the paper {{were based on a}} sample of 17 children (11 male and 6 female, mean age 11. 90 ± 3. 50 years; range 3. 8 - 17. 5 years) with IUC. The disease diagnosis was based on characteristic endoscopic and pathohistological findings. Results. The basic signs of the disease involved chronic mucosal haemorrhagic diarrhoea which was confirmed in 16 of 17 patients, with body weight deficiency (10), recurrent abdominal pain (6), fever (5), slowed-down maturation (5), marked anorexia (4), and tenesmus (3). Two patients had recurrent aphthous stomatitis, 2 anal fissures, 2 arthralgia, one autoimmune hepatitis and one pyoderma gangrenosum. None of the children had longitudinal growth retardation. Elevated sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein in blood were registered in 11, sideropenia in 10, anaemia in 6 and hypoalbuminemia in 3 patients. The remission of proctosigmoiditis and left-sided colitis was achieved with <b>aminosalicylates,</b> and of pancolitis with the combination of <b>aminosalicylates</b> and glucocorticoids, except in cases of steroid-dependent colitis, which additionally required azathioprine.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Glucocorticosteroids and aminosalicylates, mainly {{mesalazine}} (5 -ASA), {{are both}} standard therapeutics {{in the treatment}} of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. The glucocorticosteroids are highly effective in inducing remission in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, but their use is limited by the high incidence and the potentially serious nature of adverse events. In an attempt to limit systemic side effects, rapidly metabolized corticosteroids such as budesonide have been introduced. The safety profile of aminosalicylates differs between the formulations. METHODS: We summarize the potential risks associated with glucocorticosteroid and <b>aminosalicylate</b> therapy in IBDs. RESULTS: The numerous adverse events of glucocorticosteroids, particularly at high doses and prolonged treatment, include opportunistic infections, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, ocular effects (glaucoma and cataracts), psychiatric complications, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and increased fracture risk. Partially, these systemic adverse events occur with budesonide, which only has a low systemic exposure. The safety profile of 5 -ASA is comparable to placebo and superior to the old <b>aminosalicylate</b> prodrug sulfasalazine, which had a significantly higher incidence of intolerance reactions including allergic rashes. Only in rare cases has nephrotoxicity such as interstitial nephritis been associated with 5 -ASA. CONCLUSION: Considering the toxicity profile of conventional glucocorticosteroids, one primary goal of treatment in IBD should be corticosteroid-free remission. Therapy with budesonide may result in a better safety profile. 5 -ASA treatment is usually well tolerated, but with regard to the rare nephrotoxic events, it is advisable to assess renal function before and during treatment with 5 -ASA...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{inhibition}} of thiopurine methyltransferase activity, {{one of the}} enzymes responsible for azathioprine metabolism, by aminosalicylates has been described in an in vitro study. This {{could result in a}} higher risk of bone marrow depression when using the two drugs together. AIM: To investigate the in vivo interaction between azathioprine and aminosalicylates in quiescent Crohn's disease by measuring 6 -thioguanine nucleotide levels, thiopurine methyltransferase activity and the plasma levels of the acetylated metabolite of 5 -aminosalicylic acid. METHODS: Sixteen patients taking a stable dose of azathioprine, plus sulfasalazine or mesalazine, were enrolled and completed the study. They were not taking any drugs interfering with azathioprine metabolism. Four visits every 4 weeks were held over a 3 -month period. <b>Aminosalicylate</b> administration was withdrawn after the second visit. At each visit, the blood cell count, inflammatory parameters, levels of 6 -thioguanine nucleotide and the acetylated metabolite of 5 -aminosalicylic acid and thiopurine methyltransferase activity were determined. RESULTS: After <b>aminosalicylate</b> withdrawal, mean 6 -thioguanine nucleotide levels decreased significantly from 148 pmol (57 - 357 pmol) to 132 pmol (56 - 247 pmol) per 8 x 10 (8) red blood cells (P= 0. 027), without significant changes in thiopurine methyltransferase activity or biological parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This in vivo study favours the existence of an interaction between azathioprine and aminosalicylates through a mechanism which remains unclear.

The aim was to analyze pediatric CD activity at diagnosis, its influence on pediatrician's prescribing behavior, and clinical Outcome 5 years later. Methods: In a retrospective multicenter Study we divided pediatric CD patients at diagnosis into mild or moderate-severe disease. We compared initial therapies. duration of first remission, number of exacerbations, height-for-age and weight-for-height evolvement, and cumulative duration of systemic steroid use in a 5 -year follow-up period. Results: Forty-three children were included (25 with mild and 18 with moderate-severe disease). <b>Aminosalicylate</b> monotherapy was more frequently prescribed in the Mild group (40 % versus 17 % P < 0. 01). The median duration of systemic steroid use was 18. 3 months in the mild group and 10. 4 months in the moderate-severe group (P = 0. 09). Duration of first remission was 15. 0 months in the mild group and 23. 4 months in the moderate-severe group (P = 0. 16). The mean number of exacerbations was 2. 2 in the mild group and 1. 8 in the moderate-severe group (P = 0. 28). Conclusions: CD patients with mild disease were treated with <b>aminosalicylate</b> monotherapy more frequently.

40|$|Para-Aminosalicylic acid (PAS) is a {{well known}} anti mycobacterial agent and its mode action is {{believed}} to be linked to interference of the biosynthesis of the siderophore mycobactin. Certain bicyclic aromatics, in which one of the aromatic rings bears hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups ortho to one another have recently been found also to possess antimycobacterial activity (unpublished work) and this is thought to be due to similarities in their structures compared with salicylic acid, a constituent building block in mycobactin. We have therefore used the term bicyclic salicylates to describe such compounds. We propose that "bicyclic salicylates", which are hybrids of PAS and the bicyclic systems previously discovered, could be obtained from the reaction between PAS and other reagents and that these would possess greater antimycobacterial activity and less of the gastrointestinal side effects that are associated with PAS. For example, such compounds could be benzopyridines, benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles and related compounds, in which a nitrogen heterocyclic ring is fused to a benzo ring bearing a hydroxy and a carboxylic acid ortho to one another. In our investigations of such "bicyclic salicylates" we were able to synthesize ~/ quinoline derivatives by reacting PAS, or its methyl ester derivative, with selected c. s-unsanrateo carbonyl compounds following the Doebner von- Miller quinoline synthesis. We were also able to synthesize both kinetic and thermodynamic products of quinolone salicylate derivatives using a modified Conrad-Limpach synthesis, obtaining the 4 -quinolones and 2 -quinolones. Lastly "bicyclic salicylates" based on benzothiazoles were also synthesized from PAS methyl ester following a modified Jacobson synthesis. In all of our studies we observed that the orientation of the cyclisation reactions often favoured the position ortho to the phenolic group of the rr <b>aminosalicylate.</b> In the case of the benzothiazole preparations we often obtained brominated benzothiazoles (from bromination of the product) and so in these heavily substituted products we could not make a final confirmatory statement, in these cases, with respect to the orientation of cyclisation involving the <b>aminosalicylate</b> precursor. 11 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|The term {{inflammatory}} bowel diseases (IBD) {{refers to}} two distinct clinical entities: Crohn. s disease and ulcerative cholitis, two chronic and non-specific disorders of unknown origin. Although quite uncommon and usually not life-threatening, IBDs {{have a strong}} economical impact, as they tend to affect patients in high productivity ages and require long and demanding therapies, medical and sometimes surgical. The pharmacological approaches to IBD treatment include <b>aminosalicylates,</b> corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. Aminosalicylic acids are {{the most widely used}} agents for maintaining remission and for the cure of mild-tomoderate forms of IBDs. This paper outlines the main pharmacological and clinical properties of one of these drugs, mesalamine (mesalazine). Mesalamine is the active moiety of sulfasalazine, an effective but not always tolerated agent. Mesalamine is available in several pharmaceutical forms, to be administered either by the oral or by the rectal route. As the therapeutic action of <b>aminosalicylates</b> is ascribed to their topical action on the inflamed intestine, while the adverse effects are believed to be caused by the systemically adsorbed (mainly in the first tract of the small bowel) fraction, slow-release formulations are usually preferred. From an economical point of view, mesalamine appears to have a moderate acquisition cost, widely offset by the savings induced on direct sanitary and, most importantly, indirect costs of IBDs.
