40|$|Full text {{available}} at [URL] audienceThe French Court of Auditors (la Cour des Comptes) is the supreme national evaluation and control body. It has had responsibility for certifying national accounts since 2006, {{when it was}} given this role {{as a result of}} one the major state reform acts in past decades (the Loi organique relative aux lois de finances 1, LOLF). Since then it has consistently highlighted the deficiencies of ministerial internal control (IC) systems. In its 2009 <b>account</b> <b>certification</b> report 2, the Court makes this one of its two most significant reservations, thereby increasing pressure on the players in this process, especially ministries. The first point the court raises is that the issue of performance underlies the process of internal control. This type of approach goes far beyond a ‗simple' search for accounting quality. To consider accounting as the foundation for IC is a short-term and narrow view. The actual purpose of IC is to leverage efficiency and effectiveness to achieve public policy goals...|$|E

As a result, the majority of accountants in the CIS are not able to write a professional exam.

40|$|In 2008, MIT’s Peter Senge et al. {{wrote that}} the Industrial Age bubble was ending and that, {{especially}} due to climate change, a “Necessary Revolution” was needed to create a sustainable flourishing world in the decades ahead. Since then, many business organizations have moved toward sustainability to some degree, and many other organizations have emerged, mostly non-profits, to help business and/or prod them to pursue ethical strategies. This report explains how the revolution is unfolding, by briefly mapping some 150 organizations that are driving the greening of capitalism, and grouping them in several meaningful categories: Business-Led Groups, Ethical Groups, Broadened Accounting Groups, Certifying Organizations, Green Investing Groups, Sustainability Consultants, and Green Business Publishing. Each of these groups is important in facilitating the revolution, especially those promoting corporate social responsibility, broader <b>accounting</b> practices, <b>certification,</b> and green investing. Among groups that list their beginning, the median start-up date was 2003 —thus a doubling in 13 years. This revolution certainly appears to be well underway, leading to a contest between 21 st Century Green (or Sustainable) Capitalism, valuing the triple bottom line of People/Planet/Profit to some degree vs. 20 th Century Industrial Era Capitalism that adheres to a single bottom line and narrow accounting measures. But the revolution is a quiet one that is underappreciated, due to fragmentation and lack of leadership. Hopefully, if well-publicized and widely discussed, the January 2017 Better Business, Better World report of the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, making a strong all-win business case for pursuing the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, could provide a large boost to the necessary revolution. In turn, this could energize the larger system of more than 1500 sustainability-related organizations that are identified in the 329 -page April 2017 Interim Draft of The Security & Sustainability Guide.

Objective: To determine the composition of physicians completing the CME module, to assess the number of certifications written by these physicians, and to understand the trend that has occurred. Results: Among those individuals completing the training module, 25 physicians were identified by ADHS as having certified patients both before and after the module completion. Those 25 physicians <b>account</b> for 8782 <b>certifications</b> prior to the module and 28131 certifications after the institution of the module, a significant increase (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|Forest {{certification}} can {{be conceived}} {{as one of}} many rapidly growing non-state market driven (NSMD) modes of governance. The environmental effectiveness of forest certification is oftentimes evaluated by indicators such as stringency of standards, degree of participation by key stakeholders, certified area, etc. In political science, forest certification as an NSMD governance arrangement is usually evaluated {{in terms of the}} quality of the decision-making procedures (input legitimacy) rather than for its problem solving capacity, i. e. its environmental performance or effectiveness. We conceptualize environmental effectiveness as a function of a standard's environmental stringency and the area covered by the standard, the latter dependent on the degree of social acceptance. Accordingly, the environmental effectiveness of different certification schemes ought to be evaluated taking both the standard stringency and the area certified into <b>account.</b> The forest <b>certification</b> process in Sweden illustrates how forestry history and regional differences affect the development, acceptance and adoption of different certification schemes. Industrial and Northern forestry owners favour the NGO led Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards whereas Southern small-scale private forest owners preferred to develop an alternative scheme the Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). We demonstrate that there is a bifurcated geographical coverage of the two certification schemes along a north-south divide coupled with a similarity in standard stringency and a high degree of acceptance in their different areas of dominance. Both forest certification schemes display a similar degree of environmental effectiveness - but in different parts of the country and for different types of ownership. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

Next, the difficulties connected to the basically gradual and evolving nature of pilot expertise on a given type of aircraft, which contrasts with the immediate and definitive style of certifying systems. The last difficulties to be considered are those related to the goals of certification itself on these new aircraft and the status of findings from human factor analyses (in particular, what should be done with disappointing results, how much can the changes induced by human factors investigation economically affect aircraft design, how many errors do we need to accumulate before we revise the system, what should be remedied when human factor problems are discovered at the certification stage: the machine? pilot training? the rules? or everything?). The growth of advanced-automated glass cockpits has forced the international aeronautical community {{to pay more attention to}} human factors during the design phase, the certification phase and pilot training. The recent creation of a human factor desk at the DGAC-SFACT (Official French services) is a direct consequence of this. The paper is divided into three parts.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze and compare the cognitive demands of the Uniform Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and the Certified Management Accountant (CMA) examinations. Through a series of three phases, a panel of five experts classified the questions on the December 1990 and June 1991 CMA examinations, and on each of two randomly selected CMA examinations and two randomly selected CPA examinations given between November 1987 and June 1990. Using a taxonomy presented by Benjamin S. Bloom, each question was classified into one of four cognitive levels: knowledge and comprehension, application, analysis, and synthesis and evaluation. Based upon the point values of the questions, the data generated were used to test each of nine hypotheses. The Chi-square test of independence with an alpha of. 05 was used. From the results of the analysis, the following conclusions were made: (1) The CMA examination tests at a higher cognitive level than does the CPA examination; (2) Higher cognitive skills are required to pass the CMA examination than to pass the CPA examination; (3) The recent change in the CMA examination from a five-part to a four-part test has not changed the cognitive rigor of the examination; (4) Cognitive level is affected by question format, with free-response questions testing at a higher cognitive level than multiple-choice questions; and (5) Sections of both the CPA and the CMA examinations test at different cognitive levels. For the CPA examination, the Accounting Practice and Business Law sections contain questions that are of a higher cognitive level than the Auditing and Accounting Theory sections. On the CMA examination, the Financial Accounting and Reporting section tests at a lower cognitive level than do the other three sections. A recommendation is that the administrators of the CPA and CMA examinations establish standards, similar to those for examination content and format, relating to the cognitive level of the tests. Additionally, employers desiring accounting employees who can function at higher cognitive levels should express a preference for accountants with CMA <b>certification.</b> <b>Accounting</b> educators should strive to develop their students' cognitive skills as required by the CMA examination...|$|R
40|$|This is an {{historical}} {{study on the}} development of accounting in Vietnam, by examining {{the role of the state}} in the evolving professionalization of the accounting profession in the colonial and post-colonial periods. The Vietnamese accounting profession has been defined by the state, given that the development has been led by the state and subject to state regulations. Puxty et al. (1987) work which recognizes the State, Market and Community principles has provided the theoretical framework, to help understand the factors underpinning the development of the accounting profession in Vietnam. Three following research questions addressed in this study include: 1. How have external factors, such as the influence of the French, the United States, China and the Soviet Union, contributed to the development of the accounting profession in Vietnam? 2. How has the internal environment in Vietnam, including the impact of political and economic policies, contributed to the development of the accounting profession in Vietnam? 3. What is the predominant model of the accounting profession adopted in Vietnam in 2010 ? The main findings from the research suggest that despite French rule for more than eighty years, the development of the accounting profession in Vietnam in the colonial and post-colonial periods was not initiated nor influenced by the French, or the Americans. This is a distinctive difference in the development of the accounting profession between Vietnam, as an ex-French colony, compared to that which occurred in most ex-British colonies. It is argued in this study that the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) /State has played a dominant role in the development of accounting in the country in the post-colonial periods, by regulating accounting practice. The case of Vietnam, therefore, differs to that in most other Southeast Asian countries, due to the direct involvement of the VCP, through accounting regulations. The Vietnamese experience suggests that the state, led by the VCP, has followed its own path as a socialist country, by directing and playing an influential role in the development and accounting practice as well as the training of the accounting profession, in order to facilitate achievement of the state’s political and economic policies. This was achieved in spite of Vietnam’s colonial heritage, unlike the path followed in many other former colonies. By legislation, the State, through the MoF, maintains its monopoly in the <b>accounting</b> and auditing <b>certification,</b> practice and the regulatory process. The implementation of the Vietnamese CPA exams and the existence of the professional code of ethics support the existence of an accounting profession in Vietnam. In addition, the membership of the VAA to IFAC and the AFA in 1998 and of the VACPA to CAPA in 2010, is another important and significant event in the development and professionalization of accounting in Vietnam. These developments are indicative of the recognition of the existence of the accounting profession in Vietnam, and the VACPA as a professional accounting body in the Asia-Pacific region...|$|R
