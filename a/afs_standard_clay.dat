In this article, we present the IEEE 802. 11 <b>af</b> <b>standard</b> that defines international specifications for spectrum sharing among unlicensed white space devices (WSDs) and licensed services in the TV White Space (TVWS) band. Spectrum sharing is conducted through the regulation of unlicensed WSDs by a geolocation database (GDB), whose implementation differs among regulatory domains. The main difference between regulatory domains is the time scale with which WSDs are controlled by the GDB, resulting in different TVWS availability and WSD operating parameters.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 Unfrozen water within frozen soils {{is a key}} {{component}} that determines a soil's thermophysical response to changing physical and environmental conditions. This research focuses {{on the use of}} pulse nuclear magnetic resonance (P-NMR) for measuring unfrozen water content within frozen soils. The research is divided into two components: 1) improvements made to the P-NMR testing method, including refinements in the laboratory set up and testing procedure, and experimental validation of the normalization method; and 2) determination of unfrozen water content of fine-grained, cation-treated samples at various sub-freezing temperatures using the improved P-NMR methodology. Previous P-NMR testing used the first return data from the free induction decay signal intensity to calculate unfrozen water content; however, this approach may overestimate unfrozen water due to inclusion of ice content. This research used the normalization method for calculating unfrozen water, which proved to be repeatable with excellent agreement between P-NMR-derived unfrozen water and physical gravimetric water content data. Cation treatments of five <b>standard</b> <b>clays</b> and one heterogeneous soil were prepared to determine how the physicochemical structure of clays, including the adsorbed cations, controls the amount of unfrozen water. Results indicated that cation treatments have negligible effect on the unfrozen water content of kaolinite, and minimal effect on illite, chlorite, and the heterogeneous soil. Conversely, soils that are partially or completely composed of smectite demonstrated the largest unfrozen water content when treated with Na⁺ cations, and a marked reduction with the K⁺ treatment. Using the results of the <b>standard</b> <b>clay</b> testing, the unfrozen water content for the natural, heterogeneous soil was estimated, which matched measured values within 4 %. This suggests that the unfrozen water content of a heterogeneous soil with a known mineralogy may be approximated from a database of measured <b>standard</b> <b>clay</b> unfrozen water contents of <b>standard</b> <b>clays...</b>|$|R

Overview Applications in the rapidly expanding PoE (power-over-Ethernet) industry now demand power levels higher than the 12. 95 W supported by the current IEEE 802. 3 <b>af</b> <b>standard.</b> Accordingly, in September 2005 the IEEE began creating a new standard (IEEE 802. 3 at) that will extend the power delivered through Ethernet cables to at least 30 W.

While waiting for IEEE 802. 3 at to be ratified, however, the industry needs "pre-PoE+ " circuitry to meet the demands of current applications.

The results clearly indicate the difference of electrochemical behavior between Ru(NH 3) 63 + and Fe(CN) 63 - in presence/absence of CC-BL 6 in six clay-modified electrodes. Overall, the Fe(CN) 63 - model analyte could reveal more electrochemical character of CC-BL 6 than that of Ru(NH 3) 63 +. Palygorskite (PFl- 1) shows the best resolved characteristics of CC-BL 6 in clay-modified electrodes. Electroanalytic method may be applied to study bacteria characteristic and interaction between bacteria and clay minerals in future. 土壤中細菌的生長受黏土礦物種類的影響很大，瞭解其影響性有需探討不同黏土礦物與細菌間的交互作用，以及能以較迅速方便的方法來探討細菌生長上的特性。以Rhizobium tropici CC-BL 6 和三種台灣代表性土壤(大里系、秀水系、吳厝系) ，與三種得自美國黏土礦物學會的標準黏土礦物[多鐵蒙特石(SWa- 1) 、鈉蒙特石(SWy- 1) 、高嶺石(KGa- 1) ]進行孵育試驗，結果顯示菌落數與細菌的胞外磷酸酯酶成正比，土壤黏土礦物的菌落數:大里系>秀水系>吳厝系，標準黏土礦物的菌落數:SWa- 1 >SWy- 1 >KGa- 1 。大里系黏土礦物含有較多蒙特石，其對於細菌的生長與細菌所分泌出之磷酸酯酶活性上比較良好的表現。在細菌胞外磷酸酯酶與黏土礦物吸附的試驗結果顯示: SWa- 1 在第 30 分鐘與第 70 分鐘的磷酸酯酶活性高於對照組、SWy- 1 和KGa- 1 ，而在第 160 分鐘時磷酸酯酶活性降至最低。經由以六種標準黏土礦物[SWa- 1 、SWy- 1 、KGa- 1 、水輝石(SHCa- 1) 、蛭石(VTx- 1) 與坡縷石(PFl- 1) ]修飾雙層電極(Clay-Clay) 與黏土礦物-R. tropici CC-BL 6 菌液共同修飾的三明治電極(Clay-Bacteria-Clay) ，用以偵測兩種電化學活性物質Fe(CN) 63 -與Ru(NH 3) 63 +，發現Fe(CN) 63 -比Ru(NH 3) 63 + 較能顯現出細菌存在於黏粒修飾電極中的電化學特性。不同掃描速率之下，在循環伏安圖上有明顯的差異，其中以Fe(CN) 63 -所表現的差異性比Ru(NH 3) 63 +較能指出菌體的特性，且PFl- 1 在有、無細菌存在時，於 5 mV/s掃描速率下之Fe(CN) 63 -伏安圖的差異性最大，最能表現出黏粒菌體修飾電極在細菌特性鑑別上的可行性。未來利用電化學方法在細菌特性與細菌和黏土礦物交互作用上的探討應具發展潛勢。誌 謝	I 中文摘要	II Abstract	III 表索引	VI 圖索引	VII 第一章	前言	 1 第二章	前人研究	 3 一、 黏土礦物影響細菌生長之研究	 3 (一) 、黏土礦物對細菌生長的影響	 3 (二) 、黏土礦物對酵素活性的影響	 6 (三) 、細菌對黏土礦物表面特性的影響	 10 二、黏粒細菌修飾電極的電化學分析研究	 11 (一) 、黏粒修飾電極發展及用途	 11 (二) 、各種黏粒修飾電極之電化學分析	 12 第三章	材料與方法	 16 一、 黏土礦物影響細菌生長之研究	 16 (一) 、土壤影響細菌生長及磷酸酯酶之活性	 17 (二) 、黏土礦物對細菌之影響	 21 (三) 、細菌之胞外粗酵素液與黏土礦物之吸附試驗	 25 (四) 、黏土礦物表面特性受到細菌的影響	 26 二、 黏粒細菌修飾電極的電化學分析研究	 27 (一) 、黏礦與細菌孵育三日後修飾電極之電化學分析	 27 (二) 、六種標準黏礦與細菌液修飾電極之電化學分析	 29 第四章 結果與討論	 32 一、 黏土礦物影響細菌生長之研究	 32 二、 黏粒細菌修飾電極的電化學分析研究	 51 (一) 、黏礦與細菌孵育三日後修飾電極之電化學分析	 51 (二) 、不同黏土礦物細菌修飾電極的電化學特性	 62 第五章 結論	 80 第六章 未來展望	 82 參考文獻	 83 附 錄	 9...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Thromboembolism {{prevention}} {{is central to}} atrial fibrillation (AF) management. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have primarily focused on stroke prevention. Detailed analyses of extracranial thromboembolic events, particularly in patients with low dose nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), are scarce. OBJECTIVE The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess efficacy of NOACs in prevention of extracranial arterial and venous thromboembolism. METHODS We searched PubMed, CENTRAL, and CINAHL through April 2016 for phase III RCTs of NOACs in patients with AF. Information regarding systemic embolism (SE), pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was retrieved and compared by risk ratio (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) with a fixed-effects model. A network with additional RCTs involving antiplatelet agents was constructed. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) of each treatment was calculated for assessing the best treatment in the network meta-analysis. RESULTS Among 72, 963 patients with AF from 5 RCTs, relative to warfarin, standard dose NOACs were associated with a lower risk of SE (RR 0. 71, 95 % CI 0. 52 - 0. 99) and similar risks of PE and DVT (RR 0. 95, 95 % CI 0. 72 - 1. 35; and RR 0. 83, 95 % CI 0. 56 - 1. 24, respectively). Compared with warfarin, risks of SE, PE, and DVT with low dose NOACs were similar. In network meta-analyses, standard dose NOACs were associated with the largest SUCRA for prevention of SE and PE. CONCLUSION In patients with <b>AF,</b> <b>standard</b> dose NOACs were the most efficacious treatment in preventing SE, whereas both dose regimens of NOACs were reasonable alternatives to warfarin in preventing venous thromboembolis...|$|R
40|$|Abstraet [...] A new {{iron oxide}} {{dissolution}} method esigned {{to measure the}} abundance of"free " Fe oxide phases and associated elements in soils and sediments has been tested. The method employs a ternary complex of Ti(III), citrate, and ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) as a reductant and bicarbonate asa proton acceptor. The Ti(III) -citrate-EDTA-HCO 3 method issolved more synthetic amorphous ferric oxide and goethite, but less synthetic hematite, than the dithionite-citrate-HCO 3 method of Mehra and Jackson. The production of acidity by the dissolution i dicated that Ti(IV) is hydrolyzed to TiO 2 during the extractions. The heated ithionite method issolved 3 - 6 times more A 1 from kaolinite and nontronite <b>standard</b> <b>clays</b> than room temperature dithionite, and 4 - 6 times more A 1 than the Ti(III) -citrate-EDTA-HCO 3 method. Furthermore, the release of Fe from the clay mineral samples consistently and rapidly reached aplateau during multiple xtractions by the Ti(III) -citrate-EDTA-HCO 3 method, indicating that a well-defined Fe oxide fraction was removed. Fe released by the dithionite method continued toincrease with each extraction, suggesting that some release of structural Fe occurred. Tests on two natural sediments and one heavy mineral fraction from the Miocene Cohansey Sand in the New Jersey Coastal Plain suggested that the Ti(III) -citrate-EDTA-HCO 3 method removed Fe oxides more effectively and more selectively than the dithionite method. The selectivity of the Ti(III) -citrate-EDTA-HCO 3 method is enhanced by rapid extractions at room temperature and low free ligand concentrations...|$|R
