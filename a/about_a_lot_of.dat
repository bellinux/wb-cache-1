In an interview with UK's Daily Star, Gaga noted of the song, [...] "It's <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> different things.

[...] He added that while the character has [...] "an adult sensibility <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> stuff," [...] he and the writing staff try to [...] "look for ways to bring her back down to earth," [...] citing the episode's depiction of Louise [...] "fighting against growing up," [...] with Tina acting as [...] "her strange ambassador into that world...in some ways, you couldn't ask for a better guide." ...|$|E

500|$|Obsidian drew {{on older}} {{computer}} RPGs for inspiration on the storyline and gameplay, like Fallout and the Ultima series. Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart said [...] "We've been thinking <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> older RPGs, {{and we have}} this feeling that something has been lost with recent RPGs." [...] He compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to Baldur's Gate II, stating {{that he wanted to}} expand upon the city of Neverwinter as Baldur's Gate II had done with its setting, Athkatla. [...] "We're looking at how to make Neverwinter a really intriguing place to be, and make it a place where you go and come back to and go and come back to and have it really be a center for the game," [...] Urquhart said. The game's story, while still revolving around the city of Neverwinter, would be unrelated to Neverwinter Nights. Instead of starting the game as a powerful, important character, players would begin Neverwinter Nights 2 as nobodies. Obsidian wanted realism in the game and concrete consequences for the player's actions. The story would be centered on the player character, who would have to gradually earn the respect of Lord Nasher and the city of Neverwinter.|$|E

[...] Following its release, the band faced allegations of advocating the use of recreational drugs from Bill Gavin's Record Report, a weekly newsletter circulated to U.S. radio stations. [...] This resulted in [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] being banned {{in a number of}} states within a week of the report being published, a factor which contributed to the single's failure to break into the Billboard Top 10. The Byrds and their publicist, Derek Taylor, countered by strenuously denying that the song was drug-related, with Taylor issuing an indignant press release unequivocally stating that the song was about the band's trip to England and not drug use. [...] However, by the early 1980s, both Crosby and Clark were prepared to admit that the song was not entirely as innocent as they had originally declared, with the former stating [...] "Of course it was a drug song! We were stoned when we wrote it." [...] Clark was less blunt, explaining in interview that [...] "it was <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things. It was about the airplane trip to England, it was about drugs, it was about all that. A piece of poetry of that nature is not limited to having it have to be just about airplanes or having it have to be just about drugs. It was inclusive because during those days the new experimenting with all the drugs was a very vogue thing to do." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and {{produced}} by Dave Fortman. The Millennium Choir performed background vocals for the song. According to Lee, the song talks about celebrities who have completely false images. It has been misinterpreted as a message against Christian faith, due to the band's denial of being a Christian band. During an interview, Lee explained: [...] "My little sister was really getting into these, I don't want to offend anyone, but like really fake, cheesy, slutty female cracker-box idols, and it really pissed me off. She started dressing like them and she was like 8 years old. So I gave her the talk and I wrote a song." [...] She later revealed that the song was written for American pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera adding, [...] "At this point, everybody knows that Britney is fake. The song is not about Britney Spears; it's <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people in this industry. It's so fake, the whole Hollywood thing. 'Look at how perfect I am!' Nobody looks like that. It's all fake and it's really hurting a lot of girls' and women's self images. Where are all the normal people?". According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing at the website Musicnotes.com, [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] is written in the key of F major. It {{is set in a}} time signature of common time and performed in a tempo of 92 beats per minute. Lee's vocals in the song range from the note of A3 to the note of D5. After the third single from Fallen, [...] "My Immortal" [...] continued to grow successfully, Lee revealed that [...] "Imaginary" [...] would become the band's next and final single from the album stating, [...] "I think it's very epic. It's one of those big Aerosmith or Black Sabbath kind of songs. It's like an opus, with the choir and the rock and the programming. I love that song." [...] However, the release of [...] "Imaginary" [...] was scrapped and [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] was released as the fourth single from Fallen on June 4, 2004, while a maxi single was released on April 28, 2004.|$|E

500|$|During the 2016 Republican primaries, McCain said {{he would}} support the Republican nominee {{even if it was}} Donald Trump, but {{following}} Mitt Romney's March 3 speech, McCain endorsed the sentiments expressed in that speech, saying he had serious concerns about Trump's [...] "uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues". [...] Relations between the two had been fraught since early in the Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016, when McCain referred to a room full of Trump supporters as [...] "crazies", and the real estate mogul then said of McCain: [...] "He insulted me, and he insulted everyone in that room... He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured... perhaps he was a war hero, but right now he's said a lot of very bad things <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people." [...] Following Trump becoming the presumptive nominee of the party on May 3, McCain said that Republican voters had spoken and he would support Trump. [...] McCain himself faced a primary challenge from Kelli Ward, a fervent Trump supporter, and then was expected to face a potentially strong challenge from Democratic Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick in the general election. The senator privately expressed worry over the effect that Trump's unpopularity among Hispanic voters might have on his own chances but also was concerned with more conservative pro-Trmp voters; he thus kept his endorsement of Trump in place but tried to speak of him as little as possible given their disagreements. [...] However McCain defeated Ward in the primary by a double-digit percentage point margin and gained a similar lead over Kirkpatrick in general election polls, and when the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy broke, he felt secure enough to on October 8 withdraw his endorsement of Trump. McCain stated that Trump's [...] "demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults" [...] made it [...] "impossible to continue to offer even conditional support" [...] and added that he would not vote for Hillary Clinton, but would instead [...] "write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president." [...] McCain, now 80 years of age, went on to defeat Kirkpatrick, securing a sixth term as United States States Senator from Arizona.|$|E
2500|$|Critic Jeff Stark {{liked the}} comedy and wrote, [...] "Argentinean {{director}} Juan José Campanella's Son of the Bride is <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things, but {{at its core}} it's about a man's midlife crisis. A witty script, a fleet camera and a pitch-perfect cast keep the movie from being dragged under by the selfishness of its central character...By the end, this crisply agreeable picture has made several points. One, I suppose, {{is that there are}} different levels of reconciliation, in troubled families and beleaguered businesses as well as in nations beset by permanent crisis.

2500|$|Development {{was also}} {{hampered}} by Ueda's departure from Sony in December 2011. With Sony's decision {{to delay the}} release of the game early that year, Ueda and other Sony and Team Ico employees opted to leave Sony. Ueda stated in 2013 interview that his departure from Sony was due to feeling [...] "a sense of crisis within myself <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things" [...] on news of the delay. Some of those that departed Sony went on to other projects. For example, executive producer Yoshifusa Hayama joined Bossa Studios to work on social/mobile games, while two Team Ico artists joined an indie startup studio Friends & Foes to develop their first title, Vane, which has been compared visually to The Last Guardian. Ueda and other former Team Ico members, including Jinji Horagai, the lead programmer from Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, created a new studio, genDESIGN. In founding the studio, they were faced with a choice, according to Ueda: [...] "Do we try to create something new, or do we keep going, providing support on The Last Guardian?" [...] genDESIGN opted to commit themselves to helping Sony complete The Last Guardian through contract and working alongside Sony's internal studio, Japan Studio. Under this arrangement, genDESIGN developed the creative content for the game, such as character design and animation and level design, which was then put into place via Japan Studio, with Ueda maintaining oversight on the completed project.|$|E
