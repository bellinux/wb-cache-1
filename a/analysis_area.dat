50|$|Estimating the {{likelihood}} of pest introduction and of the consequences that could result involves many uncertainties. Uncertainty is always part of pest risk analysis; very often {{there is a lack}} of data necessary to reach secure conclusions. The subjective nature of pest risk analysis is also a source of uncertainty. ISPM 11 recognises that pest risk analysis involves many uncertainties, largely since estimates and extrapolations are made from real situations where the pest occurs to a hypothetical situation in the pest risk <b>analysis</b> <b>area.</b> In most cases analyses performed during pest risk analysis use historical data to forecast potential future events. It is important to document the areas of uncertainty and the degree of uncertainty in the assessment, and to indicate where expert judgement has been used. This is necessary for transparency and may also be useful for identifying and prioritizing research needs.|$|E

5000|$|When {{simultaneous}} EDS/EBSD collection can be achieved, {{the capabilities}} of both techniques can be enhanced. There are applications where sample chemistry or phase cannot be differentiated via EDS alone because of similar composition; and structure cannot be solved with EBSD alone because of ambiguous structure solutions. To accomplish integrated mapping, the <b>analysis</b> <b>area</b> is scanned and at each point Hough peaks and EDS region-of-interest counts are stored. Positions of phases are determined in X-ray maps and measured EDS intensities are given in charts for each element. For each phase the chemical intensity ranges are set to select the grains. All patterns are then re-indexed off-line. The recorded chemistry determines which phase / crystal structure file is used for indexing of each point. Each pattern is indexed by only one phase and maps displaying clearly distinguished phases are generated. The interaction volumes for EDS and EBSD are significantly different (on the order of micrometers compared to tens of nanometers) and the shape of these volumes using a highly tilted sample may have implications on algorithms for phase discrimination.|$|E
50|$|Pest risk analysis, as {{conducted}} {{under the}} IPPC and SPS Agreement, has been criticised for being reactive, only {{coming into effect}} after a pest problem has been identified. For example, many pests now subject to phytosanitary measures, supported by pest risk analysis, only became recognised as potential risks once they had already escaped from their geographical centres of origin and caused impacts {{in other parts of}} the world. Some ‘newly escaped’ organisms were previously unknown to science before they escaped and current international standards for pest risk analysis cannot assess risks from unknown organisms. In addition, a pest risk analysis will focus on a pest at the species level assuming the pest to be genetically stable but this can be a great oversimplification if the pest has a short generation time with capacity for rapid genetic change. During the assessment of impact, assessors focus on impacts on known hosts or habitats. However, if a pest adapts to a new host plant or habitat once established in the pest risk <b>analysis</b> <b>area,</b> impacts will be underestimated. Risk analyses for invasive species have also been criticised for being narrowly focused, subjective, often arbitrary and unquantified, and subject to political interference.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{advantages}} of high spatial resolution and precise chemical sensitivity attributed to AES, there are several factors that can limit the applicability of this technique, especially when evaluating solid specimens. One {{of the most common}} limitations encountered with Auger spectroscopy are charging effects in non-conducting samples. Charging results when the number of secondary electrons leaving the sample is different from the number of incident electrons, giving rise to a net positive or negative electric charge at the surface. Both positive and negative surface charges severely alter the yield of electrons emitted from the sample and hence distort the measured Auger peaks. To complicate matters, neutralization methods employed in other surface analysis techniques, such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), are not applicable to AES, as these methods usually involve surface bombardment with either electrons or ions (i.e. flood gun). Several processes have been developed to combat the issue of charging, though none of them is ideal and still make quantification of AES data difficult. One such technique involves depositing conductive pads near the <b>analysis</b> <b>area</b> to minimize regional charging. However, this type of approach limits SAM applications as well as the amount of sample material available for probing. A related technique involves thinning or [...] "dimpling" [...] a non-conductive layer with Ar+ ions and then mounting the sample to a conductive backing prior to AES. This method has been debated, with claims that the thinning process leaves elemental artifacts on a surface and/or creates damaged layers that distort bonding and promote chemical mixing in the sample. As a result, the compositional AES data is considered suspect. The most common setup to minimize charging effects includes use of a glancing angle (~10°) electron beam and a carefully tuned bombarding energy (between 1.5 keV and 3 keV). Control of both the angle and energy can subtly alter the number of emitted electrons vis-à-vis the incident electrons and thereby reduce or altogether eliminate sample charging.|$|E

To test this hypothesis, a sample of 10, 134 condominium and 48, 913 house transactions was analyzed. The sales were grouped into eight geographic <b>analysis</b> <b>areas.</b> Hedonic models were used to quantify the contributory effect on value of the time of sale, age of the unit, and other significant housing characteristics. The price indices created by the hedonic models for each housing type are then compared within geographic areas and across the valley. The paper shows that condominium price appreciation is significantly below the appreciation of single family houses in seven of the eight areas examined, which represents 80 % of the sample. Valley wide regressions were then conducted utilizing geographic dummy variables for the individual <b>analysis</b> <b>areas.</b> These models indicate a strong premium for units of both housing types located in the downtown area. by John D.
