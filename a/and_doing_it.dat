You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
25|$|In July 1943, the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was {{dispatched}} to England and {{came under the}} command of the 3rd Parachute Brigade of the British 6th Airborne Division. The Battalion then spent the next year in training for airborne operations. Major differences between their previous American training and the new regime included jumping with only one parachute, <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> {{through a hole in the}} floor of the aircraft, instead of through the door of a C-47 Dakota.|$|E
25|$|To {{begin with}} {{cognitive}} responses in infidelity, individuals {{whom have been}} cheated on experience jealousy cognitively for many reasons. They may feel that their partner has lost interest in them and feel that they cannot compare to the persons with whom they are being cheated on with (Johnson, 2017). Therefore, they anticipate {{the loss of their}} partner's emotional interest in them and become jealous for more clear reasons. They could believe that they are losing someone who they care deeply about, or they may feel as if their partner is mad at them <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> out of spite, etc. The anticipation of jealous feelings towards an individual’s significant other causes a cognitive response, even without the burden of proof.|$|E

The song is also included on their album Get On Up <b>And</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> Again.|$|R
500|$|During his career, Ford {{developed}} a reputation as an immensely physical centre-forward, especially toward opposition goalkeepers. His Wales international teammate John Charles commented on his playing style, stating that [...] "He used to bang everybody and knock {{them out of the}} way, he was never frightened" [...] but also described him as a wonderful person. Former England international Gil Merrick accused Ford of maltreating goalkeepers in his autobiography, although Ford later sued Merrick, stating that he had never been cautioned or sent off over his style of play, and received an apology and the withdrawal of the book over the claim. Ford himself stated that his personality was transformed once he stepped onto a football pitch, describing himself as [...] "Like an animal" [...] but also commenting that he was simply [...] "doing his job <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> well" [...] Billy Bingham later stated [...] "He got some terrible knocks from goalkeepers but he also knew how to dish it out and he never complained to refs".|$|E
500|$|Carey {{confessed that}} she never tried to change the {{situation}} because [...] " [...] used to be insecure and cautious, and so [...] would {{listen to what the}} people said." [...] However, the control Mottola exerted over her career soon [...] "spilled into her personal life" [...] once they were married, increasing the amount of conflict between the two. Soon, it was obvious that their marriage was in shambles; as stated in a Vanity Fair article, [...] "the couple began to argue {{at the drop of a}} hat." [...] Carey was very involved in the project, more so than she had ever been on an album. [...] "I went into this phase of recording, recording, recording <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> really fast," [...] she told Time. [...] "This time, I had more time, and I focused more on what I wanted to do." [...] As Carey's career and work continued to reflect her views on how it should sound, her marriage to Mottola continued to [...] "deteriorate".|$|E
500|$|Whether or {{not such}} {{language}} {{is an accurate}} reflection of the vernacular of blacks in Mississippi at the time, the effect of its usage has offended some critics, who see it as perpetuating racial stereotypes. The character Queenie (who sings the above verses) in the original production was played not by an African American but by the Italian-American actress Tess Gardella in blackface (Gardella was {{perhaps best known for}} portraying Aunt Jemima in blackface). Attempts by non-black writers to imitate black language stereotypically in songs like [...] "Ol' Man River" [...] was alleged to be offensive, a claim that was repeated eight years later by critics of Porgy and Bess. But such critics sometimes acknowledged that Hammerstein's intentions were noble, since [...] "Ol' Man River"' was the song in which he first found his lyrical voice, compressing the suffering, resignation, and anger of an entire race into 24 taut lines <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> so naturally that it's no wonder folks assume the song's a Negro spiritual." ...|$|E

500|$|Carter, Duchovny and Anderson {{celebrated the}} 20th {{anniversary of the}} series at a July 18, 2013 panel at the San Diego Comic-Con hosted by TV Guide. During the discussion, Anderson {{discussed}} Scully's influence on female fans, relating {{that a number of}} women have informed her that they entered into careers in physics because of the character. Anderson also indicated that she was not in favor of an X-Files miniseries, and Duchovny ruled out working with her on an unrelated project, but both expressed willingness to do a third feature film. Carter was more reserved at the idea, stating, [...] "You need a reason to get excited about going on <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> again." [...] The series attained a degree of historical importance, as well. On July 16, 2008, Carter and Spotnitz donated several props from the series and new film to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Some of the items included the original pilot script and the [...] "I Want to Believe" [...] poster from Mulder's office.|$|E
500|$|Levels were {{designed}} {{based on a}} Deluxe Paint interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in [...] "hundreds of levels". There were several internal iterations of the levels, each designer challenging the others. Dailly pointed out that David Jones [...] "used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing a finger at the screen and saying 'There! Beat that!', we'd calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps, <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> in a much simpler method. 'Oh...', he'd mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it." [...] They also sent internally tested levels to Psygnosis, getting back {{the results of their}} testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that [...] "Every now and again though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and it gave us all a warm fuzzy feeling inside." ...|$|E

2500|$|Good {{friends in}} real life, Fred Allen and Jack Benny {{inadvertently}} hatched a running gag in 1937, {{when a child}} prodigy, violinist Stuart Canin, gave a very credible performance on the Allen show, inspiring an Allen wisecrack about [...] "a certain alleged violinist," [...] who should hide in shame over his poor playing. Allen often mentioned his show-business friends on the air ("Mr. Jacob Haley of Newton Highlands, Massachusetts" [...] was Allen's way of saying hello to his pal Jack Haley), and on the Canin broadcast Allen knew Benny would be listening. Benny, according to Allen biographer Taylor, burst out laughing, then responded in kind on his own program. And they were off and running, going at it {{for over a decade}} <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> well enough to convince some if not many fans of both shows that the two comedians really were blood enemies.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} on 15 November 2009, that Benaud {{had signed a}} three-year contract with the Nine Network to continue being part of their cricket coverage until 2013, although his role would change from that of ball-by-ball commentary. Benaud said: [...] "I won't be doing live commentary any more." [...] Someone asked me, [...] "Does that mean you'll never again go into the commentary box?", [...] "Well, the answer to that", Benaud replied, [...] "If there is, as there always can be, some emergency or a sensational happening on or off the field {{where it would be}} quite ridiculous not to go into the commentary box, of course I'll be in there doing my job <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> as professionally as I can. But I won't be on the live commentary roster. But I will be doing all sorts of, what I regard as, interesting things for Channel Nine on the cricket—special features on the cricket...". Richie commentated regularly during the 2011–12 season and was part of Nine's commentating team/roster.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Crosby {{recorded}} {{bundles of}} tracks that were titled Turquoise 3.x and Crimson 3.x; {{they were released}} through an online electronic delivery outlet. Crosby solidified his band's line-up during this time, and from then on, VAST became a four-person band. With the unusual method of distribution of these tracks by a band with a relatively large fanbase formerly signed to a major label, many record companies were outraged with the releases. As a result from pressure from his former label, Elektra, Crosby was forced to sign a short-term deal with Carson Daly-owned independent label 456 Entertainment to release {{the best of both}} bundles as one album, titled Nude. This release also had the most high-quality versions of the songs, as the online releases were only available via mp3. In later years, Crosby said the idea of releasing Nude on an indie label was a [...] "nightmare" [...] because [...] "There were so many problems dealing with them (456 Entertainment) on every level. I feel we made a big mistake not believing in ourselves enough <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> on our own." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 2006, Scott {{announced}} {{a remake of}} the action thriller The Warriors (1979). [...] "The original Warriors was New York in the 1970s, and everything went upwards, everything went vertically. And now I'm making it a contemporary thing <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> in L.A., so everything is horizontal. So my vision of The Warriors is Los Angeles in 2007 and the gangs, instead of being 30, {{are going to be}} 3,000 or 5,000," [...] he said. Scott met with actual gang members for research: [...] "I've met all the heads of all the different gangs, so I've already educated myself. They all said, 'Listen dude, if you get this on we'll sign a treaty and we'll all stand on the Long Beach Bridge. There'll be 150,000 members there. It'll look like the L.A. Marathon. Scott was simultaneously developing a drama project titled Emma's War about British foreign aid worker Emma McCune. Scott said in October 2006, [...] "It's been a difficult piece to crack. We had one writer aboard who did a pass at the script and didn't get it, but we've got someone else onboard now who I'm going to make live down there and smell it, touch it, feel it. There's nothing that can compare to that kind of first-hand experience." ...|$|E
