5|$|Actinides easily {{react with}} halogens forming salts with the {{formulas}} MX3 and MX4 (X = halogen). So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with {{an amount of}} 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide chlorides, bromides, and iodides are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation of uranium isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to <b>anhydrides.</b> They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.|$|E

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{molecular}} characterization of maleic <b>anhydride</b> melt-functionalized polypropylene (PP-g-MA). The functionalization mechanism, the nature, the concentration, {{and the location of}} grafted <b>anhydride</b> species onto the polypropylene chain are discussed. The polypropylene functionalization was performed using a pre-heated Brabender Plastograph (190 degrees C, 4 min of mixing time). Several concentrations of maleic <b>anhydride</b> and organic peroxide were used for this study. In those experimental conditions, the organic peroxide undergoes an homolytic rupture and carries out a polypropylene tertiary hydrogen abstraction. The resulting macroradical undergoes a beta-scission leading to a radical chain end which reacts with maleic <b>anhydride.</b> When a termination reaction occurs at this first step a succinic type <b>anhydride</b> chain end is obtained. However, oligomerization of maleic <b>anhydride</b> is found to occur more frequently leading to poly(maleic <b>anhydride)</b> chain end. Concentration of both <b>anhydride</b> types and minimal length of the grafted poly(maleic <b>anhydride)</b> were determined. A fraction of maleic <b>anhydride</b> does not react with polypropylene or homopolymerize leading to nongrafted poly(maleic <b>anhydride).</b> (C) 1995 John Wiley and Sons, Inc. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|Acetic anhydride, {{like most}} acid <b>anhydrides,</b> is a {{flexible}} molecule with a nonplanar structure.

25|$|Acylation {{generally}} {{occurs at}} the 2-position, {{through the use of}} various methods. Acylation with acid <b>anhydrides</b> and acid chlorides can occur without a catalyst; alternatively, a Lewis acid may be used. 2-Acylpyrroles are also obtained from reaction with nitriles, by the Houben–Hoesch reaction. Pyrrole aldehydes can be formed by a Vilsmeier–Haack reaction. N-Acylation of simple pyrrole does not occur.|$|E
25|$|The phenoxide anion has {{a similar}} nucleophilicity to free amines, with the further {{advantage}} that its conjugate acid (neutral phenol) does not become entirely deactivated as a nucleophile even in moderately acidic conditions.

25|$|Amides can be {{prepared}} by the reaction of ammonia with carboxylic acid derivatives. Acyl chlorides are the most reactive, but the ammonia must be present {{in at least a}} twofold excess to neutralise the hydrogen chloride formed. Esters and <b>anhydrides</b> also react with ammonia to form amides. Ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be dehydrated to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present: temperatures of 150–200°C are required.|$|E

25|$|Pyridine {{is used as}} a polar, basic, low-reactive solvent, {{for example}} in Knoevenagel condensations. It is {{especially}} suitable for the dehalogenation, where it acts as the base of the elimination reaction and bonds the resulting hydrogen halide to form a pyridinium salt. In esterifications and acylations, pyridine activates the carboxylic acid halides or <b>anhydrides.</b> Even more active in these reactions are the pyridine derivatives 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and 4-(1-pyrrolidinyl) pyridine.

25|$|Under Friedel–Crafts {{reaction}} conditions, arenes {{react with}} sulfonyl halides and sulfonic acid <b>anhydrides</b> affording sulfones. Commonly used catalysts include AlCl3, FeCl3, GaCl3, BF3, SbCl5, BiCl3 and Bi(OTf)3, among others. Intramolecular Friedel–Crafts cyclization occurs with 2-phenyl-1-ethanesulfonyl chloride, 3-phenyl-1-propanesulfonyl chloride and 4-phenyl-1-butanesulfonyl chloride on heating in nitrobenzene with AlCl3. Sulfenyl and sulfinyl chlorides also undergo Friedel–Crafts–type reactions, affording sulfides and sulfoxides, respectively. Both aryl sulfinyl chlorides and diaryl sulfoxides {{can be prepared}} from arenes through reaction with thionyl chloride {{in the presence of}} catalysts such as BiCl3, Bi(OTf)3, LiClO4 or NaClO4.|$|E
25|$|While the {{addition}} to the electron-rich alkenes and alkynes is mainly electrophilic, the nucleophilic addition {{plays an important role}} for the carbon-heteroatom multiple bonds, and especially its most important representative, the carbonyl group. This process is often associated with an elimination, so that after the reaction the carbonyl group is present again. It is therefore called addition-elimination reaction and may occur in carboxylic acid derivatives such as chlorides, esters or <b>anhydrides.</b> This reaction is often catalyzed by acids or bases, where the acids increase by the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group by binding to the oxygen atom, whereas the bases enhance the nucleophilicity of the attacking nucleophile.|$|E
25|$|Acyl {{chlorides}} {{can be used}} {{to prepare}} carboxylic acid derivatives, including acid <b>anhydrides,</b> esters, and amides by reacting acid chlorides with: a salt of a carboxylic acid, an alcohol, or an amine respectively. The use of a base, e.g. aqueous sodium hydroxide or pyridine, or excess amine (when preparing amides) is desirable to remove the hydrogen chloride byproduct, and to catalyze the reaction. While it is often possible to obtain esters or amides from the carboxylic acid with alcohols or amines, the reactions are reversible, often leading to low yields. In contrast, both reactions involved in preparing esters and amides via acyl chlorides (acyl chloride formation from carboxylic acid, followed by coupling with the alcohol or amine) are fast and irreversible. This makes the two-step route often preferable to the single step reaction with the carboxylic acid.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are (where [...] "R" [...] is an organic group): alcohols (R-OH); ethers (R-O-R); ketones (R-CO-R); aldehydes (R-CO-H); carboxylic acids (R-COOH); esters (R-COO-R); acid <b>anhydrides</b> (R-CO-O-CO-R); and amides (...) [...] There are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen, including: acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, furan, THF, diethyl ether, dioxane, ethyl acetate, DMF, DMSO, acetic acid, and formic acid. Acetone (...) and phenol (...) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances. Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are: glycerol, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, citric acid, acetic anhydride, and acetamide. Epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom {{is part of a}} ring of three atoms. The element is similarly found in almost all biomolecules that are important to (or generated by) life.|$|E
500|$|In 1853, Charles Frédéric Gerhardt had {{published}} the first methods to prepare acetylsalicylic acid. [...] In {{the course of}} his work on the synthesis and properties of various acid <b>anhydrides,</b> he mixed acetyl chloride with a sodium salt of salicylic acid (sodium salicylate). A vigorous reaction ensued, and the resulting melt soon solidified. Since no structural theory existed at that time Gerhardt called the compound he obtained [...] "salicylic-acetic anhydride" [...] (wasserfreie Salicylsäure-Essigsäure). When Gerhardt tried to dissolve the solid in a diluted solution of sodium carbonate it immediately decomposed to sodium salts of salicylic and acetic acids. In 1859 an Austrian chemist, Hugo von Gilm, obtained analytically pure acetylsalicylic acid (which he called acetylierte Salicylsäure, acetylated salicylic acid) by a reaction of salicylic acid and acetyl chloride. In 1869 Schröder, Prinzhorn and Kraut repeated both Gerhardt's (from sodium salicylate) and von Gilm's (from salicylic acid) syntheses and concluded that both reactions gave the same compound—acetylsalicylic acid. (Prinzhorn is credited in the paper with conducting the experiments.) They were first to assign to it the correct structure with the acetyl group connected to the phenolic oxygen.|$|E
