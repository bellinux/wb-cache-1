5|$|In 1982, Atari Inc. {{released}} {{their version}} of Namco's hit arcade game Pac-Man for its Atari 2600 video game console. Like the original arcade version, the player controls the title character with <b>a</b> <b>joystick.</b> The object is to traverse a maze, consuming all the wafers within while avoiding four ghosts.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To compare {{wheelchair}} {{driving performance}} in a driving simulator using <b>a</b> conventional <b>joystick</b> and <b>an</b> isometric <b>joystick.</b> Design: Randomized, cohort study. Setting: A research facility based in a hospital or in an independent living center. Participants: Participants (N= 20; 12 men, 8 women; mean age ± SD, 30. 62 ± 10. 91 y) who were at least 1 year post-TBI. Interventions: Driving performance using <b>an</b> isometric <b>joystick</b> compared with <b>a</b> conventional movement <b>joystick.</b> Main Outcome Measures: Average trial completion time, and trajectory-specific measures measured orthogonal {{to the center of}} driving tasks: root mean squared error, movement offset, movement error, and number of significant changes in heading. Results: After statistically controlling for driving speed, participants were able to complete the driving tasks faster with <b>an</b> isometric <b>joystick</b> than while using <b>a</b> conventional movement <b>joystick.</b> Compared with the conventional <b>joystick,</b> <b>an</b> isometric <b>joystick</b> used for driving forward demonstrated fewer driving errors. During reverse driving the conventional joystick performed better. Conclusions: The customizable isometric joystick seems to be a promising interface for driving a powered wheelchair for individuals with TBI. © 2011 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine...|$|R

5|$|Slalom was {{originally}} released in 1986 in the arcades {{as part of}} the Nintendo VS. System and was titled Vs. Slalom. This release featured an upright cabinet, <b>a</b> <b>joystick,</b> one jump button, monaural sound, and standard raster graphics. There was also an optional controller upgrade that featured two physical ski poles and shortened skis that the player could stand on and use to control the skier onscreen. The NES version was released by Nintendo in North America in March1987 and in Europe on October15, 1987. Slalom was Rare's first video game developed as a new company. It was also the Stamper brothers' first video game console release.|$|E
5|$|The arcade {{release of}} Cross Generation of Heroes has a control scheme {{consisting}} of <b>a</b> <b>joystick</b> and four buttons. Wii versions of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom have five control options: the Classic Controller, Nintendo GameCube controller, third-party arcade sticks, and two simplified control schemes—intended for inexperienced players—for the Wii Remote. Players use controller inputs to perform attacks; {{the most basic}} attacks are executed by pressing one of three attack buttons: light, medium, or strong. Players may augment basic attacks with joystick or control pad directional inputs; for example, a standard strong attack can become a sweep when the down input is added. Basic attacks can be strung together to perform combos.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Lemmings {{also has}} 20 two-player levels. This {{took advantage of}} the Amiga's ability to support two mice simultaneously, and the Atari's ability to support a mouse and <b>a</b> <b>joystick</b> simultaneously. Each player is presented with their own view of the same map (on a vertically split screen), can only give orders to their own lemmings (green or blue), and had their own base. The goal is to get more lemmings (regardless of colour) into one's own base than the other player. Gameplay cycles through the 20 levels until neither player gets any lemmings home.|$|E
5|$|The player uses <b>a</b> <b>joystick</b> {{to control}} Pac-Man, {{navigating}} {{him through a}} maze of consumable dashes called Video Wafers,  opposed by a quartet of multi-colored ghosts. The goal of the game is to consume all the wafers in each level in order to proceed to the next one in search of the highest possible score. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touches Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends. Each game starts with four lives, and the player is awarded a bonus life upon successful completion of each level, up to a maximum of nine lives in reserve at any given time.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Melee {{differs from}} {{traditional}} fighting games as {{the objective is}} to force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each character's health is measured by a meter that represents the damage received as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked back, and the easier they are to knock off the stage, which will result in the character's death and the loss of a stock, or life. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which moves are entered by button-input combinations, most moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and <b>a</b> <b>joystick</b> direction.|$|E

5|$|Spindizzy is {{an action}} and puzzle game played from an {{isometric}} perspective. Players can view {{the playing field}} from four angles, and rotate between them. The game {{takes place in a}} fictional landscape of interconnected stages suspended in a dimensional space. The player controls a probe called a Gyroscopic Environmental Reconnaissance And Land-Mapping Device (GERALD), via keyboard commands or <b>a</b> <b>joystick.</b> The craft is able to transform—and modify its mobility as a result—between three configurations: a ball, an inverted square pyramid, and a gyroscope. Players navigate the probe through the stages to explore the world within a time limit. The time limit can be extended by collecting power jewels scattered through the world and is decreased by falling off a stage. Stages feature ramps, corridors, and other obstacles that hinder the player from quickly traversing them. The game ends when time expires or the world is completely explored.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} game {{incorporating}} graphics that updated in real time, rather than {{only when the}} player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for {{a demonstration of the}} University of Michigan-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954. The game, developed over six months by the pair, featured a pool stick controlled by <b>a</b> <b>joystick</b> and a knob, and a full rack of 15 balls on a table seen in an overhead view. The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion. Like previous video games, the pool game was intended primarily to showcase the computing power of the MIDSAC computer.|$|E
5|$|The player uses <b>a</b> <b>joystick</b> and {{button to}} input commands, though home {{versions}} use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted {{portions of the}} background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on {{the location of the}} cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.|$|E

5|$|Defender is a {{two-dimensional}} side-scrolling shooting game {{set on the}} surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right. <b>A</b> <b>joystick</b> controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three ships to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks. A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy, or hit by an enemy projectile, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly do). After exhausting all ships, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, Atari {{produced}} an arcade game {{version of the}} concept called Lunar Lander. This version featured monochrome vector graphics and allowed the player to rotate the ship right or left and fire thrusters controlled with a proportional throttle control system using <b>a</b> <b>joystick</b> with a spring. Like Moonlander, both a graphical display of a repeating mountainous surface {{as well as a}} text readout of the ship's speed, altitude, and remaining fuel are displayed. Once a game begins, it only ends when a player runs out of fuel, rather than due to a time limit; players can insert quarters to add fuel to their current game. Bonus points are awarded for landing on difficult parts of the map. The game features four levels of difficulty in controlling the ship. Lunar Lander was Atari's first vector graphics game and the first multiple-perspective video game; when the lander got close to the surface, the view changed to a close-up view of the lander. The vector engine was inspired by Space Wars (1978) and created by Rick Moncrief and Howard Delman, who developed Lunar Lander alongside Rich Moore. The idea for the game came from Delman, who had seen a graphical version of the game, likely Moonlander, a few years prior. At least one other arcade game based on the Lunar Lander concept was developed around the same time, Lunar Rescue by Taito.|$|E
5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, which has more impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed of the craft and the time needed to fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and be able to do so with either <b>a</b> <b>joystick,</b> or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E

50|$|In 1973, Atari's Space Race was a space-themed arcade {{video game}} where players {{controlled}} spaceships that race against opposing ships, while avoiding comets and meteors. It was a competitive two-player game controlled using <b>a</b> two-way <b>joystick,</b> and {{was presented in}} black and white graphics. The same year, Taito released a similar space-themed racing video game Astro Race, which used <b>an</b> early four-way <b>joystick.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Fidget Cube {{is a small}} {{handheld}} device (known as a fidget toy) designed by Antsy Labs.
