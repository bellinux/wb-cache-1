Although dexmedetomidine, a selective α[2]-adrenoceptor agonist with some affinity for the I-receptor is expected to affect platelet function, the effects of dexmedetomidine on platelet functions remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of dexmedetomidine on human platelet functions in vitro. The effects of dexmedetomidine on platelet aggregation were examined using <b>aggregometers.</b> The formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in platelets was measured by an enzyme immunoassay. In addition, P-selectin expression in platelets was estimated by flow cytometry. We showed that dexmedetomidine enhances platelet aggregation. But in the presence of yohimbine, an α[2]-antagonist, dexmedetomidine suppressed platelet aggregation. Efaroxan, an I[1]-antagonist, and methylene blue, a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, abolished the suppressive effect of dexmedetomidine, whereas idazoxan, an I[2]-antagonist, showed no effect. Dexmedetomidine suppressed cAMP formation and enhanced P-selectin expression in platelets, and these effects were inhibited by yohimbine. Dexmedetomidine increased cGMP formation in platelets in the presence of yohimbine, and this increase was suppressed by efaroxan.

40|$|The {{effects of}} anti-platelet drugs on {{human whole blood}} {{aggregation}} were evaluated using a novel whole blood <b>aggregometer</b> by a screen filtration pressure (SFP) method. The SFP whole blood <b>aggregometer</b> was found to successfully detect whole blood aggregation induced by ADP, collagen and TRAP by measuring the SFP of blood samples. The platelet aggregation threshold index (PATI), the concentration of agonist required with an inducing pressure rate of 50 %, varied time-dependently after collection of blood. High values for ADP and collagen were noted immediately after blood collection, suggesting low aggregation activity of platelets, and gradually increase thereafter. Cilostazol (phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor), dipyridamole, aspirin and tirofiban all inhibited whole blood aggregation in vitro. Inhibitory effects of cilostazol and dipyridamole, but not tirofiban, were markedly enhanced 6 or 7 fold by long pre-incubation (60 [*]min), compared with short pre-incubation (2 [*]min). Such enhancement was only observed with ADP- and not collagen-induced whole blood aggregation. A similar phenomenon was also observed for aggregation with platelet rich plasma (PRP). Cilostazol inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was more potent with PRP than whole blood (PATI 200 = 3. 80 ± 0. 95 [*]μM for whole blood; 2. 04 ± 0. 61 [*]μM for PRP). Inhibitory effects of dipyridamole were attenuated in PRP without erythrocytes. These results demonstrate that the SFP <b>aggregometer</b> can sensitively detect anti-platelet aggregatory effects of various kinds of drugs.

Aggregation responses were measured at established intervals of time following phenylbutazone administration. Data on untreated dogs indicated that arachidonic acid, at a final concentration of 50 micrograms/mL and collagen, at a final concentration of 5 micrograms/mL, were useful agents for studying whole blood platelet aggregation in the dog, but adenosine diphosphate, at a final concentration of 30 microM was not. The high single dose (900 mg) of phenylbutazone significantly inhibited platelet aggregation to arachidonic acid at 1. 5, 4, 7 and 12 hours following administration.

30|$|SCF was {{studied for}} {{its effects on}} ADP- and collagen-induced {{platelet}} aggregation using Chronolog whole blood platelet <b>aggregometer.</b> Human blood (9  ml) was freshly collected from “O” positive, healthy volunteers with prior and informed consent, in 3.8 % sodium citrate (1  ml) under expert medical supervision. All {{studies were carried out}} using the whole blood platelet <b>aggregometer.</b> Blood was incubated with 0.85 % saline (1 : 1 dilution) in a cuvette for 5  min at 37  °C. Platelet aggregation agonists ADP (10  μM) or collagen (2  μg/ml) added to the above mixture served as positive controls. As a platelet agonist is added to the mixture, platelets aggregate as a monolayer on the electrical probes immersed in the cuvettes. Accumulation of platelets offers a resistance (or impedance) to the electrical circuit which is quantified in ohms. Change in impedance is expressed as a function of time. Protein fraction(s) incubated with the blood, saline, and agonist mixture served as test samples. Blood incubated with saline served as negative control. Positive control showed maximum resistance. Negative controls were devoid of any agonists for aggregation and hence offered negligible resistance (Chanda, Sarkar, Sistla, & Chakrabarty, 2013).|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} here a 12 -channel <b>aggregometer,</b> {{evolved from}} the instrument described by Beug & Gerisch in 1972, which records the course of aggregation or agglutination of cells or other particles by following the changes in light-scattering of the aggregating suspension. The instrument incorporates a simple memory system for condensing the data, introduces an improved cuvette design, and can be adjusted in its responsiveness to light-scattering by particles of different sizes. In our <b>aggregometer,</b> a vertical wheel in an opaque thermostatted chamber accommodates up to 12 cuvettes each containing a cell suspension and an air bubble. The constant rising of the bubble as the wheel rotates causes the stirring action which promotes aggregation. At {{a certain point in}} its rotational path, each cuvette is penetrated by a beam of light focused upon an absorbing beam stop centred in front of a photomultiplier tube. Particles suspended in the cuvette scatter a portion of the light beyond the beam stop into the photomultiplier tube to produce an electrical pulse proportional to the photon input. Collection of these pulses with the wheel in continuous motion avoids any disturbance of the course of aggregation. The pulses are routed to memory circuits for summation and eventual recording by a 12 -channe...|$|E
40|$|The Laser-assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyzer (LORCA) {{is unique}} in its {{capacity}} to measure at least two important hemorheological parameters, i. e., deformability of red blood cells (RBC) {{as well as their}} aggregation behaviour. In this communication the main principles and characteristics of the <b>aggregometer</b> mode of this instrument are described. Via syllectometry (i. e., laser backscatter versus time), the method allows the measure of both static and kinetic parameters of the aggregation process, e. g., total extent of aggregation, aggregation half time and a combination of these, defined as aggregation index. When the syllectogram deviates from that representing normal rouleaux formation, e. g., in the case of RBC clump formation, this is signalled by a fit error. Maximal flexibility is obtained by various options like an automated re-iteration procedure (which enables to measure the aggregation tendency and/or the aggregate stability) and aggregation at low shear rate. Experiments dealing with reproducibility, stability and sensitivity of the instrument are described. The latter include a few "classic" methods for inducing subtle changes in RBC aggregation behaviour both regarding cellular factors (heat treatment) and changes in medium constituents (fibrinogen, dextrans). It can be concluded that the <b>aggregometer</b> mode of the LORCA considerably increases the feasibility of this instrument for hemorheological investigation...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{verotoxin}} (VT) - 1 produced by Escherichia coil O 157 on platelets was studied with a laser light-assisted shear-induced platelet <b>aggregometer</b> and with binding assays. VT- 1 remarkably enhanced the platelet aggregation under low shear stress, {{but did not}} affect it under high shear stress. The minimal concentration of VT- 1 required for the enhancement was 0. 25 ng/ml, and almost maximal enhancement was achieved at a final concentration of 4 ng/ml. This enhanced platelet aggregation disappear- ed after leukocyte depletion from normal platelet-rich plasma with a specific filter. In contrast, with a standard platelet <b>aggregometer</b> such enhanced platelet aggregation was not detected either in {{the presence or absence}} of ADP. ¹²⁵I-Labeled VT- 1 did not specifically bind to normal washed platelets depleted of leukocytes, and thin layer chromatographic analysis of neutral glycolipids extracted from normal platelet lysates also demonstrated that leukocyte-depleted platelets lacked VT- 1 -specific receptor globotriaosylceramide (Gb 3), but pre-filtered ones retained Gb 3. Supernatant from mononuclear cell suspension stimulated with VT- 1 enhanced platelet aggregation, but that from polymorphonuclear cell suspension did not. Several cytokines released from monocytes reproduced this enhance- ment in vitro. Further, plasmas from six out of seven patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) exhibited the same effect as did the purified VT- 1. This effect was almost impaired after treatment of HUS plasmas with Gb 3 in accord with decreased levels of plasma VT- 1. Taken together, these results indicate that platelet lacks Gb 3, and VT- 1 appears to modulate platelet aggregation in an indirect fashion, presumably by releasing cytokines or proteins from target tissues...|$|E

The Myrenne <b>Aggregometer</b> provides indices at stasis (M) and at low shear (M 1), with four indices obtained with the LORCA and RheoScan-A: amplitude (AMP), half-time (T 1 / 2), surface area (SA) above (LORCA) or below (RheoScan-A) the syllectogram, and the ratio (AI) {{of the area}} above (LORCA) or below (RheoScan-A) the syllectogram to total area (AI). Intra-assay reproducibility and biological variability were determined; also studied were RBC in diluted plasma and in 1 % 500 kDa dextran, and 0. 003 % glutaradehyde (GA) -treated cells in plasma. All measurements were performed at 37 degrees C. Standardized difference values were used {{as a measure of}} power to detect differences. Salient results were: (1) intra-assay variations below 5 % except for RheoScan-A AMP and SA; (2) biological variability greatest for T 1 / 2 with other indices similar for the three devices; (3) all instruments detected progressive changes with plasma dilution; (4) the Myrenne and LORCA, but not the RheoScan-A, detected differences for cells in dextran; (5) GA-treatment significantly affected the LORCA (AMP, T 1 / 2, SA, AI), the RheoScan-A (AMP, SA, AI) and the Myrenne M parameter.

Platelet aggregation is usually studied using light <b>aggregometer</b> that neither mimics the conditions found in human microvasculature nor detects microaggregates. A new method for the measurement of platelet microaggregation under flow conditions using a commercially available quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) has recently been developed. The aim {{of the current study}} was to investigate if QCM-D could be used for the measurement of nanoparticle-platelet interactions. Silica, polystyrene, and gold nanoparticles were tested. The interactions were also studied using light aggregometry and flow cytometry, which measured surface abundance of platelet receptors. Platelet activation was imaged using phase contrast and scanning helium ion microscopy. QCM-D was able to measure nanoparticle-induced platelet microaggregation for all nanoparticles tested at concentrations that were undetectable by light aggregometry and flow cytometry.

Inhibition of agonist-induced aggregation in an <b>aggregometer</b> was used to confirm results of the microplate assay and to determine the specific mode of inhibition of 2 samples. The marine sponge Xestospongia sp. yielded a xestospongin/araguspongine-type molecule that inhibited collagen-induced aggregation by 87 % at 2 micro g/ml, and epinephrine-induced aggregation by 78 % at 20 micro g/ml, while the marine sponge Aplysina sp. yielded 5, 6 -dibromotryptamine, which inhibited epinephrine-induced aggregation by 51 % at 20 micro g/ml. In this study {{we have found that}} the microplate assay is a simple, inexpensive, yet useful preliminary tool to qualitatively screen a large number of marine samples for antiplatelet aggregation activity...|$|E
30|$|First, our {{objective}} was to compare the platelet function between two different ICAs (Visipaque 270 ®, Iopamiron 200 ®) and a control solution (phosphate buffer solution, PBS). Five patients were included {{in this part of}} the study. Their PRP samples were divided in three equal sub-samples and mixed with 50  μL of PBS, Visipaque 270 ® and Iopamiron 200 ®. For each mixture (PRP[*]+[*]PBS, PRP[*]+[*]Visipaque 270 ®, PRP[*]+[*]Iopamiron 200 ®), the platelet aggregation was evaluated according to 4 tests after a delay of incubation of 30 mn, using: (i) 10  μmol/L adenosine diphosphate (ADP, Sigma Aldrich Chimie, Lyon, France), (ii) 1  mmol/L arachidonic acid (AA, Nu-Chek-Prep, Elysian, Minnesota, USA), (iii) 25  μmol/L thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP, NeosystemSA, Strasbourg, France), and (iv) 2  μg/μL of equine tendon collagen (Horm-Chemie collagen, Nycomed Pharma, Munich, Germany). The tests were achieved in an <b>aggregometer</b> (APACT® 4004, ELITechGroup, Salon de Provence, France) according to standard procedures and during an aggregation test time of 300  s.|$|E
40|$|Not much {{is known}} about red cell {{aggregation}} during cardio-pulmonary bypass surgery (CPB). Blood samples from 19 patients undergoing CPB were anticoagulated with EDTA. Hematocrit was adjusted to 40 %. A red blood cell <b>aggregometer</b> (LORCA) measured changes in light reflection from each blood sample after cessation of the rotation, and calculated an aggregation index (Al). Reflection measurements were stored. Because LORCA software failed for 87 of 171 samples, we developed new software, and applied it to the stored reflection measurements. This software failed only in 7 out of 171 cases and showed that all LORCA failures occurred for Al < 40 %. The new calculations revealed that the aggregation index significantly decreased from 46. 6 +/- 10. 1 (mean +/- standard deviation) baseline to 22. 8 +/- 8. 3 {{at the end of}} CPB and recovered to 37. 1 +/- 13. 5 at day 1. It is concluded that the new software can be used to study decreased red cell aggregation during CPB...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{clinically}} healthy Sella Italiana horses {{were used in}} order to assess the variations of platelet aggregation in response to different workload. Blood samples were collected from each horse at rest, immediately after exercise and 30 min {{after the end of the}} exercise. By means of an <b>aggregometer</b> platelet aggregation was quantitated as maximum degree of platelet aggregation and initial velocity platelet aggregation. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to determine significant differences (p< 0. 05) due to the intensity of exercise and different experimental condition. Our results showed a similar trend of platelet aggregation between treadmill and obstacle course, but statistically significant differences emerged on studied parameters in relation to different workload. These results showed an inhibition of platelet response that probably represents a protective endothelial mechanism through the production of nitric oxide during different workloads in athletic horses. Key words: different workload, horse, physical exercise, platelet aggregatio...|$|E
