2500|$|By the 20th century, earlier {{mechanical}} calculators, cash registers, <b>accounting</b> <b>machines,</b> {{and so on}} were redesigned to use electric motors, with {{gear position}} as the representation {{for the state of}} a variable. The word [...] "computer" [...] was a job title assigned to people who used these calculators to perform mathematical calculations. By the 1920s, British scientist Lewis Fry Richardson's interest in weather prediction led him to propose human computers and numerical analysis to model the weather; to this day, the most powerful computers on Earth are needed to adequately model its weather using the Navier–Stokes equations.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the Second World War, the IRS was {{handling}} sixty million tax returns each year, using a combination of mechanical desk calculators, <b>accounting</b> <b>machines</b> and pencil and paper forms. In 1948 punch card equipment was used. The first trial of a computer system for income tax processing was in 1955, when an IBM 650 installed at Kansas City processed 1.1 million returns. The IRS was authorized to proceed with computerization in 1959, [...] and purchased IBM 1401 and IBM 7070 systems for local and regional data processing centers. The Social Security Number was used for taxpayer identification starting in 1965. By 1967, all returns were processed by computer and punched card data entry was phased out.|$|E
