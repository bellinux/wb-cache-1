Although many of the primary industries were highly successful, they were never conducted on a scale sufficient to bring long lasting wealth. By the 1830s, the sealing industry had petered out, and although whaling persisted, {{it was on a}} scale diminished from the first twenty years. Despite the decline in these industries, the export of Tasmanian wool continued to thrive. New industries were required to replace the declining trades, and shipbuilding was one of the new successes for Hobart Town in the 1830s. The quality of the island's hardwood timber resources, combined with excellent port facilities and access to major shipping routes meant that by 1850, Hobart Town was producing more wooden ships than all other Australian ports combined.

40|$|We {{consider}} static, cylindrically symmetric configurations {{in general}} relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) with an arbitrary gauge-invariant Lagrangian {{of the form}} L_em= Φ(F), F =F_mnF^mn. We study electric and magnetic fields with three possible orientations: radial (R), longitudinal (L) and azimuthal (A), {{and try to find}} solitonic stringlike solutions, having a regular axis and a flat metric at large r, with a possible angular defect. Assuming the function Φ(F) to be regular at small F, it is shown that a regular axis is impossible in R-fields if there is a nonzero effective electric charge and in <b>A-fields</b> if there is a nonzero effective electric current along the axis. Solitonic solutions are only possible for purely magnetic R-fields and purely electric <b>A-fields,</b> in cases when Φ(F) tends to a finite limit at large F. For both R- and <b>A-fields,</b> the desired large r asymptotic is only possible with a non- Maxwell behaviour of Φ(F) at small F. For L-fields, solutions with a regular axis are easily obtained (and can be found by quadratures) whereas a desired large r asymptotic is only possible in an exceptional solution; the latter gives rise to solitonic configurations in case Φ(F) = ·√(F). We give an explicit example of such a solution. Comment: 7 pages, Latex- 2 e,gc. sty, to appear in Grav. & Cosmo...|$|R

Introduction. It was J. Neyman who in his pioneering work [8] of 1936 laid the foundations of an analytic approach to what is nowadays called the theory of suficient decision procedures.

40|$|Generalized {{geometry}} of type B n {{is the study}} of geometric structures in T + T * + 1, the sum of the tangent and cotangent bundles of a manifold and a trivial rank 1 bundle. The symmetries of this theory include, apart from B-fields, the novel <b>A-fields.</b> The relation between B n -geometry and usual generalized geometry is stated via generalized reduction. We show {{that it is possible to}} twist T + T * + 1 by choosing a closed 2 -form F and a 3 -form H such that dH+F 2 = 0. This motivates the definition of an odd exact Courant algebroid. When twisting, the differential on forms gets twisted by d + F τ+ H. We compute the cohomology of this differential, give some examples, and state its relation with T -duality when F is integral. We define B n -generalized complex structures (B n -gcs), which exist both in even and odd dimensional manifolds. We show that complex, symplectic, cosymplectic and normal almost contact structures are examples of B n -gcs. A B n -gcs is equivalent to a decomposition (T + T * + 1) ℂ = L + L&# 772; + U. We show that there is a differential operator on the exterior bundle of L+U, which turns L+U into a Lie algebroid by considering the derived bracket. We state and prove the Maurer-Cartan equation for a B n -gcs. We then work on surfaces. By the irreducibility of the spinor representations for signature (n+ 1,n), there is no distinction between even and odd B n -gcs, so the type change phenomenon already occurs on surfaces. We deal with normal forms and L+U -cohomology. We finish by defining G 2 2 -structures on 3 -manifolds, a structure with no analogue in usual generalized geometry. We prove an analogue of the Moser argument and describe the cone of G 2 2 -structures in cohomology. </p...|$|R

"Sir Thomas Clarke may be {{considered}} as the next lord of Merdon, though he was never in possession of either the lodge or the park, and held {{only for a few}} years what he did possess.

Yet {{it is easy to see}} that small primitive differences of a certain order, must, in the long run, bring about a wide divergence of the human stock from the others. {47} It is a reasonable supposition that, in the earliest human organisms, an improved brain, a voice more capable of modulation and articulation, limbs which lent themselves better to gesture, a more perfect hand, capable among other things of imitating form in plastic or other material, were combined with the curiosity, the mimetic tendency, the strong family affection, of the next lower group; and that they were accompanied by exceptional length of life and a prolonged minority. The last two peculiarities are obviously calculated to strengthen the family organisation, and to give great weight to its educative influences. The potentiality of language, as the vocal symbol of thought, lay in the faculty of modulating and articulating the voice. The potentiality of writing, as the visual symbol of thought, lay in the hand that could draw; and in the mimetic tendency, which, as we know, was gratified by drawing, as far back as the days of Quaternary man. With speech as the record, in tradition, of the experience of more than one generation; with writing as the record of that of any number of generations; the experience of the race, tested and corrected generation after generation, could be stored up and made the starting point for fresh progress.

[67] It may be observed, in {{anticipation}} {{of some of our}} future [...] results, that while some conditions of the affections are [...] aimed at by the economist as final, others are necessary to [...] him as his own instruments: as he obtains them in greater or [...] less degree his own farther work becomes more or less [...] possible.

Whether [...] the injustice take the form of the desire of dominion, or of [...] refusal to submit to it, or of lust of territory, or lust of [...] money, or of mere irregular passion and wanton will, the [...] result is economically the same;--loss of the quantity of [...] power and life consumed in repressing the injustice, as well [...] as of that requiring to be repressed, added to the material [...] and moral destruction caused by the fact of war. The early [...] civil wars of England, and the existing war in America, are [...] curious examples--these under monarchical, this under [...] republican institutions--of the results of the want of [...] education of large masses of nations in principles of [...] justice. This latter war, especially, may perhaps at least [...] serve for some visible, or if that be impossible (for the [...] Greeks told us that Plutus was blind, as Dante that he was [...] speechless), some feelable proof that true political economy [...] is an ethical, and by no means a commercial business.

[...] O fountain Arethuse, and thou honored flood, [...] 85 [...] Smooth-sliding Mincius, crowned with vocal reeds, [...] That strain I heard was of a higher mood. [...] But now my oat proceeds, [...] And listens to the Herald of the Sea, [...] That came in Neptune's plea. [...] 90 [...] He asked the waves, and asked the felon winds, [...] What hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain? [...] And questioned every gust of rugged wings [...] That blows from off each beaked promontory. [...] They knew not of his story; [...] 95 [...] And sage Hippotades their answer brings, [...] That not a blast was from his dungeon strayed: [...] The air was calm, and on the level brine [...] Sleek Panope with all her sisters played. [...] It was that fatal and perfidious bark, [...] 100 [...] Built in the eclipse, and rigged with curses dark, [...] That sunk so low that sacred head of thine. [...] Next, Camus, reverend sire, went footing slow, [...] His mantle hairy, and his bonnet sedge, [...] Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge [...] 105 [...] Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe. [...] "Ah! who hath reft," [...] quoth he, [...] "my dearest pledge?" [...] Last came, and last did go, [...] The Pilot of the Galilean Lake; [...] Two massy keys he bore of metals twain [...] 110 [...] (The golden opes, the iron shuts amain). [...] He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake:-- [...] "How well could I have spared for thee, young swain, [...] Enow of such as, for their bellies' sake, [...] Creep, and intrude, and climb into the fold! [...] 115 [...] Of other care they little reckoning make [...] Than how to scramble at the shearers' feast, [...] And shove away the worthy bidden guest. [...] Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold [...] A sheep-hook, or have learnt aught else the least [...] 120 [...] That to the faithful herdman's art belongs! [...] What recks it them? What need they? They are sped; [...] And, when they list, their lean and flashy songs [...] Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw; [...] The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed, [...] 125 [...] But swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw, [...] Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread; [...] Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw [...] Daily devours apace, and nothing said. [...] But that two-handed engine at the door [...] 130 [...] Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more." [...] Return, Alpheus; the dread voice is past [...] That shrunk thy streams; return, Sicilian Muse, [...] And call the vales, and bid them hither cast [...] Their bells and flowerets of a thousand hues. [...] 135 [...] Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use [...] Of shades, and wanton winds, and gushing brooks, [...] On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks, [...] Throw hither all your quaint enamelled eyes, [...] That on the green turf suck the honeyed showers, [...] 140 [...] And purple all the ground with vernal flowers. [...] Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies, [...] The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine, [...] The white pink, and the pansy freaked with jet, [...] The glowing violet, [...] 145 [...] The musk-rose, and the well-attired woodbine, [...] With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head, [...] And every flower that sad embroidery wears; [...] Bid amaranthus all his beauty shed, [...] And daffadillies fill their cups with tears, [...] 150 [...] To strew the laureate hearse where Lycid lies. [...] For so, to interpose a little ease, [...] Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise. [...] Ay me! whilst thee the shores and sounding seas [...] Wash far away, where'er thy bones are hurled; [...] 155 [...] Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides, [...] Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide [...] Visit'st {{the bottom of the}} monstrous world; [...] Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied, [...] Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old, [...] 160 [...] Where the great Vision of the guarded mount [...] Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold. [...] Look homeward, Angel, now, and melt with ruth: [...] And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth. [...] Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more, [...] 165 [...] For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, [...] Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor. [...] So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed, [...] And yet anon repairs his drooping head, [...] And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore [...] 170 [...] Flames in the forehead of the morning sky: [...] So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high, [...] Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves, [...] Where, other groves and other streams along, [...] With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves, [...] 175 [...] And hears the unexpressive nuptial song, [...] In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love. [...] There entertain him all the Saints above, [...] In solemn troops, and sweet societies, [...] That sing, and singing in their glory move, [...] 180 [...] And wipe the tears forever from his eyes. [...] Now, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more; [...] Henceforth thou art the Genius of the shore, [...] In thy large recompense, and shalt be good [...] To all that wander in that perilous flood.
