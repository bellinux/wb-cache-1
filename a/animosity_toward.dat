Their distinctive dress and appearance was highly recognizable in the goldfields. Chinese miners suffered enormously, enduring violent racism from white miners who aimed their frustrations at foreigners. To this day, {{there has been}} no justice for known victims. Further <b>animosity</b> <b>toward</b> the Chinese led to legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and Foreign Miners Tax.|$|E

5|$|In August 1923, Evans {{participated in}} a Klan parade in the heavily Catholic borough of Carnegie, Pennsylvania, which was {{attacked}} by local residents. One member of the Klan was killed; Evans declared him a martyr and hoped that the death would inspire new recruits. The incident gave a fillip to the Klan's recruitment efforts, but increased Stephenson's <b>animosity</b> <b>toward</b> Evans, on whom he blamed the incident. Stephenson's proclivity for ostentation irritated Evans. Although Stephenson left his official Klan position after a short tenure, under his leadership the Klan's northern supporters had begun to rival those in the South. He had been a skilled campaigner and demagogue, and he remained a well-known advocate of the Klan's platforms after resigning. Evans avoided publicly clashing with him, fearing that it would hurt the candidacies of Klan-backed politicians: Stephenson was closely involved in the successful gubernatorial candidacy of Indiana Klan-member Edward L. Jackson, and the Klan members had significant electoral gains in that state in 1924, including the election of several candidates to the state legislature. After these victories, Stephenson showed further disdain for Evans.|$|E

Chile also wanted to become the dominant South American military and commercial power along the Pacific. Santa Cruz united Peru and Bolivia in the Peru-Bolivian Confederation in 1836 {{with a desire to}} expand control over Argentina and Chile. Portales got Congress to declare war on the Confederation.

5|$|In early March, Union Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, then {{commander}} of the Department of the Missouri, ordered Grant to remain at Fort Henry, and on March 4 turned field command of the expedition over to a subordinate, Brig. Gen. C. F. Smith, who had recently been nominated as a major general. (Various writers assert that Halleck took this step because of professional and personal <b>animosity</b> <b>toward</b> Grant; however, Halleck shortly restored Grant to full command, perhaps influenced by an inquiry from President Abraham Lincoln.) Smith's orders were to lead raids intended to capture or damage the railroads in southwestern Tennessee. Brig. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's troops arrived from Paducah, Kentucky, to conduct a similar mission to break the railroads near Eastport, Mississippi. Halleck also ordered Grant to advance his Army of West Tennessee (soon to be known by its more famous name, the Army of the Tennessee) on an invasion up the Tennessee River. Grant left Fort Henry and headed upriver (south), arriving at Savannah, Tennessee, on March 14, and established his headquarters on the east bank of the river. Grant's troops set up camp farther upriver: five divisions at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, and a sixth at Crump's Landing, four miles from Grant's headquarters.|$|E

50|$|The Burr-Hamilton duel {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous {{personal}} conflicts in American history. It was a draw duel which arose from long-standing personal bitterness that developed between the two men over the course of several years. Tensions reached a boiling point with Hamilton's journalistic defamation of Burr's character during the 1804 New York gubernatorial race, in which Burr was a candidate. The duel was fought at a time when the practice was being outlawed in the northern United States, and it had immense political ramifications. Burr survived the duel and was indicted for murder in both New York and New Jersey, though these charges were later either dismissed or resulted in acquittal.

50|$|A further {{change of}} policy {{occurred}} {{during the reign of}} Umar II (717-720). The disastrous failure of the siege of Constantinople in 718 which was accompanied by massive Arab casualties led to a spike of popular <b>animosity</b> among Muslims <b>toward</b> Byzantium and Christians in general. At the same time, many Arab soldiers left the army for civilian occupations and they wished to emphasize their high social status among the conquered peoples. These events prompted introduction of restrictions on non-Muslims, which, according to Hoyland, were modeled both on Byzantine curbs on Jews, starting with the Theodosian Code and later codes, which contained prohibitions against building new synagogues and giving testimony against Christians, and on Sassanid regulations that prescribed distinctive attire for different social classes.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The study aims {{to explore}} the novel issue of how {{consumers}} perceive sponsorship initiatives by foreign companies and how the sponsors' country-of-origin (COO) cue may influence sponsorship outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: The measurement model and proposed relationships were tested based on a sample of 811 Chinese consumers using confirmatory factor analysis and structural path analysis. Findings: The results reveal that attitudes toward the sponsor completely mediate the effect of event involvement on willingness to buy from the sponsor (WBS). Attitudes toward the sponsor also partially mediate the relationship between economic animosity towards a specific sponsor's COO and WBS. Additionally, {{the level of a}} country's economic competitiveness found to moderate the negative relationship between economic <b>animosity,</b> attitudes <b>toward</b> the sponsor and WBS. Research limitations/implications: The nature of the product type and the desire of the consumer to own such a product may have influenced the measurement of willingness to buy. Practical implications: The research adds to the existing knowledge by identifying the opportunities and potential biases that a foreign company may encounter when considering sponsoring a mega sport event in a different cultural context. The study helps managers to understand how sports sponsorship could be used effectively in emerging markets. Originality/value: The proposed conceptual model advances the application of classical conditioning theory, the consumer animosity model of foreign product purchase and the belief-attitude-intention hierarchy in the sponsorship arena.

25|$|What the {{agreements}} with the United States and neighboring tribes and a hiatus in the struggle with Texas accomplished was to free up the Comanche to make unrestrained war on the Mexican provinces south of the Rio Grande. As the 1830s demonstrated, the Texans, the United States, and neighboring tribes all {{had the ability to}} invade Comancheria and attack the Comanche homeland. Mexico, by contrast, was rich in horses and unable to counterattack due to distance and the fact that, after 1836, any Mexican military expedition against Comanches would have had to pass through Texas, a republic whose independence Mexico did not recognize. In attacking Mexico, the Comanche seemed motivated by opportunity, economics and revenge – their <b>animosity</b> <b>toward</b> non-Comanches sharpened by decades of war and reprisals.

40|$|In the German press {{published}} in Opava, Silesia, {{at the beginning}} of the 20 th century there was outlined the mostcomprehensive program of excluding Jews from the protection of otherwise commonly binding law. What preventedits popularization was the intervention of the Austrian public prosecutor as the censoring agency. The programanticipated the provisions of the later Nazi Nuremberg laws. In the Austrian monarchy, the propaganda of racialanti-Semitism that was launched by the German nationalistic press and alluded to an alleged anthropological inferiorityof the Jews aimed at fostering a universal disdain toward them and promoting an acceptance of their legalexclusion. The Austrian prosecuting agency reacted sharply to these attempts and confiscated each issue of Germannationalistic press products in which references to the ideology of racial anti-Semitism and appeals to the legal exclusionof the Jews were detectable. The type of anti-Semitism that dominated in Galicia and in the Czech area was different in its nature. It had economic,cultural and religious backgrounds. It tended to evoke <b>animosity</b> and hostility <b>toward</b> Jews in order to separatethem from the Christian part of society. In Galicia, attempts to resort to administrative and legal measuresagainst the Jews and reduce them to citizens of an inferior category were rare. In the anti-Semitic texts that werecensored by the Cracow or Lvov prosecuting agencies there were no open demands for the deprivation of the Jews oftheir public and civic rights as “a suitable method of getting rid of the pernicious influence of the Jews on Polishsociety”. In Galicia, it was thanks to the role played in education by the conservative and catholic class, which ruledthe province, that the question of abolishing equal rights for Jews did not become part of the public or political discourse...|$|R
5000|$|Initially in {{the third}} film, Scott {{exhibits}} the same seeming <b>animosity</b> and indifference <b>toward</b> his father's ineptitude and lack of awareness of being a 'Dad'. However, when Dr. Evil escapes from prison, he returns to his new submarine lair to find a surprise: Scott has willingly started to go bald, signifying {{that he has a}} desire to become more evil. He also presents his father a pool full of sharks with laser beams on their heads (a reference to the first film in which Dr. Evil requested sharks [...] "with frikkin' laser beams attached to their frikkin' heads", instead of the sea bass procured by his henchmen). Scott quickly replaces Mini-Me at his father's side, ultimately causing Mini-Me to defect to the Ministry of Defence with Austin Powers. At the end of the movie, however, Dr. Evil renounces his evil ways after discovering that he is, in fact, Austin's biological brother, thus making Scott, Austin's biological nephew and Nigel's biological grandson. This enrages Scott, who announces his hatred for his father, his uncle, his grandfather, Foxxy Cleopatra (he admits he only probably does as he doesn't really know her), and especially Mini-Me despite Austin attempting to advise him that he has to find his own path rather than constantly trying {{to live up to his}} father's expectations. He escapes the submarine while running in a strangely effeminate manner. In the movie's final scene, Scott has taken over his father's criminal empire, is dressed in black (a black version of his father's normal outfit) and is completely bald. He declares his revenge on his uncle and mimics his father's evil laugh before dancing around the lair in a Michael Jackson-esque fashion.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} attempt to {{identify}} {{the extent to which}} the Torres Strait Islanders traditional hunting practices have been disrupted by the overall decline in dugong and sea turtle populations, which has directly correlated to an increase in hunting restrictions put in place by the Australian Government. The traditional hunting of dugongs and sea turtles provides not only a food source, but brings prestige to the men who catch them and serves as an educational platform to teach the younger generations about their culture. There are many environmental threats that impact the populations of sea turtles and dugongs though the main threats are loss of habitat and food source. The primary food source, seagrass, is extremely sensitive to environmental changes and affects how many marine species the ecosystem can support. The populations have to be monitored closely in order to prevent overhunting and the extinction of these majestic species. The Torres Strait Islanders maintain a rich culture and have faced many hardships; hardships most recently due to the restrictions of colonialism. In recent years they have been granted the rights to their traditional lands, reefs, and natural resources. Many indigenous groups worldwide are at odds with their federal governments of their countries over land and natural resource rights. Though these indigenous people may consider themselves to be the original owners of the land or resources through process of dispossession and colonialism they have lost this ownership and corresponding rights. The Australian Government and the Torres Strait Islanders are working to combat decades of post-colonial attitudes and practices regarding land and resource management by working within a co-management system. This system is designed to give the indigenous populations a forum to voice their concerns and be part of this instrumental decision making process. Both for cultural and subsistence reasons the Torres Strait Islanders have a vested interest in the protection of dugongs and sea turtles for future generations. This connection precludes remaining <b>animosity</b> or hostility <b>toward</b> the once colonial authority and offers a foundation on which the Torres Strait Islanders are willing to cooperate with the Australian Government on the development of restrictions for traditional hunting practices until the populations of these species are able to rebound...|$|R
