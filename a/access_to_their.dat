5|$|Verdi wrote Falstaff, {{which was}} the last of his 28 operas, as he was {{approaching}} the age of 80. It was his second comedy, and his third work based on a Shakespeare play, following Macbeth and Otello. The plot revolves around the thwarted, sometimes farcical, efforts of the fat knight, Sir John Falstaff, to seduce two married women to gain <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> husbands' wealth.|$|E
5|$|All ground {{stations}} {{are connected to}} KSAT's Tromsø Network Operation Center, which is also connected to the TSS and TrollSat.

The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution. The facility uses interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E

5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar were {{increasingly}} denied <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They {{also developed a}} taste for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: firing the bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.|$|E

5|$|German {{successes in}} Europe {{encouraged}} Japan to increase pressure on European governments in Southeast Asia. The Dutch government {{agreed to provide}} Japan some oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies, but negotiations for additional <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> resources ended in failure in June 1941. In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East. The United States, United Kingdom and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo. At the same time, Japan was planning an invasion of the Soviet Far East, intending to capitalize off the German invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{the huge}} numbers of {{newcomers}} were driving Native Americans out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners. This provoked counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered. Those who escaped massacres were many times unable to survive without <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> food-gathering areas, and they starved to death. Novelist and poet Joaquin Miller vividly captured one such attack in his semi-autobiographical work, Life Amongst the Modocs.|$|E

5|$|Over 90% of the sicklefin lemon shark's diet {{consists}} of bottom- and shore-dwelling teleosts, including herring, mullets, mackerel, silversides, needlefish, smelt-whitings, porgies, sea catfish, triggerfish, parrotfish, and porcupinefish. Occasionally, {{they may also}} take cephalopods and crustaceans, and older individuals {{have been known to}} consume stingrays and guitarfish. This species may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites include the tapeworms Paraorygmatobothrium arnoldi, Pseudogrillotia spratti, Phoreiobothrium perilocrocodilus, and Platybothrium jondoeorum. Sicklefin lemon sharks have been documented resting on the bottom and eliciting cleanings by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus), during which they may open their mouths and stop respiring for as long as 150 seconds to give the wrasses <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> mouths and gills.|$|E
5|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of people attempted to flee Afghanistan following the attacks, fearing a response by the United States. Pakistan, already home to many Afghan refugees from previous conflicts, closed its border with Afghanistan on September 17, 2001. Approximately one month after the attacks, the United States led a broad coalition of international forces to overthrow the Taliban regime from Afghanistan for their harboring of al-Qaeda. Though Pakistani authorities were initially reluctant to align themselves with the United States against the Taliban, they permitted the coalition <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> military bases, and arrested and handed over to the U.S. over 600 suspected al-Qaeda members.|$|E
5|$|The first fortifications in Malta {{were built}} during the Bronze Age. At least six sites have been {{identified}} as possible fortified settlements. The best preserved of these is the village of Borġ in-Nadur, close to the modern town of Birżebbuġa. Around 1450 BC, the inhabitants of the village built a 4.5m high D-shaped bastion to bar <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> village. The wall was built facing inland, showing that the people living in the village were more afraid of attacks from the land than from the sea.|$|E

5|$|The {{parents and}} {{families}} of Indigenous children resisted the residential school system throughout its existence. Children were kept from schools and, in some cases, hidden from government officials tasked with rounding up children on reserves. Parents regularly advocated for increased funding for schools, including {{the increase of}} centrally located day schools to improve <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> children, and made repeated requests for improvements {{to the quality of}} education, food, and clothing being provided at the schools. Demands for answers in regards to claims of abuse were often dismissed as a ploy by parents seeking to keep their children at home, with government and school officials positioned as those who knew best.|$|E
5|$|Black {{attempts}} to locate further {{information about the}} Millennium Group's activity, having believed them defeated in 1999. He finds that his <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> old computer systems still works, and learns that they may know the whereabouts of his daughter Jordan. Spurred on by several momentary encounters with similarly demonic beings, Black returns to his home town of Seattle, Washington. As he visits the grave of his wife Catherine, he is tranquilised and apprehended by Group members. Waking in captivity, he learns that they seek his help against the same demonic forces he has been encountering—and that Jordan is now a willing initiate of the Group. She has now begun to powerfully manifest visions of the future, similar to Black's ability to see the past through others' eyes.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{returned}} to Leeds City from Barnbow after hostilities had ended, but resigned suddenly in December 1918, eventually moving to Selby {{to take up}} a position as a superintendent at an oil and coke works. No reason was given for his resignation, but as football resumed in 1919–20, Leeds City were accused by a former player of financial irregularities, involving illegal payments to guest players during wartime matches. No documentary evidence was produced, but Leeds' refusal to allow the authorities <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> financial records was deemed a sign of guilt, and they were expelled from the Football League in October 1919 and five club officials, including Chapman, were banned from football for life. The club was dissolved, with the players auctioned off and their Elland Road ground taken over by the newly formed Leeds United.|$|E
