2500|$|Social {{immunity}} is any antiparasite defence {{which is}} mounted {{for the benefit}} of individuals other than the actor. For parasites, the frequent contact, high population density and low genetic variability makes social groups of organisms a promising target for infection: this has driven the evolution of collective and cooperative <b>anti-parasite</b> mechanisms that both prevent the establishment of and reduce the damage of diseases among group members. Social immune mechanisms range from the prophylactic, such as burying beetles smearing their carcasses with antimicrobials or termites fumigating their nests with napthalene, to the active defenses seen in the imprisoning of parasitic beetles by honeybees or by the miniature 'hitchhiking' leafcutter ants which travel on larger worker's leaves to fight off parasitioid flies. Whilst many specific social immune mechanisms have been studied for some time in relative isolation (e.g. the [...] "collective medication" [...] found in wood ants), it was only until Sylvia Cremer et al.'s 2007 landmark paper 'Social Immunity' in Current Biology did the topic become seriously considered as a whole, conceptually and in an evolutionary sense. Empirical and theoretical work in social immunity continues to reveal not only new mechanisms of protection but also implications for our understanding of the evolution of group living and polyandry, as well as having consequences for our more general understanding of the origin of complex regulatory systems.|$|E
2500|$|Levels of sociality {{across the}} class Insecta range from eusocial species (with {{cooperative}} brood care, overlapping generations within {{a colony of}} adults and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive castes) to solitary living, with many intermediate systems in between which despite lacking full eusociality still may exhibit parental care or nest cohabitation. Different systems of social organization alter both the possibility and cost-benefit ratio of social immune mechanisms (e.g. guarding {{the entrance to the}} nest requires both division of labour, whilst allogrooming merely requires behavioural interactions), though the absence of many behaviours currently only recorded in eusocial taxa from non-eusocial taxa may simply be {{due to a lack of}} study of these group's social immune systems. For instance it seems plausible that insects living in common nest sites could evolve to remove conspecific corpses from the nest or to isolate an infected group member - and yet these behaviours (and many more) have only been recorded in eusocial species. Alternatively it may be the case that whilst the three conditions of eusociality themselves are not prerequisites for the emergence of these behaviours, [...] secondary consequences of eusociality are. Perhaps the large number of individuals in eusocial colonies increases the efficiency of collective <b>anti-parasite</b> defences and thus their emergence begins to be selected for; or perhaps the preponderance of non-reproductive individuals is a necessary driver for the evolution of these behaviours, as when in a colony attacked by a parasite they can only increase their indirect fitness via social immunity directed at the queen's brood.|$|E

Cremer's definition focused on the collective benefits of behaviours and was adopted by other behavioural ecologists (e.g. Wilson-Rich 2009) when describing immune phenomena which were contingent on the action of multiple individuals. Cremer went on to develop a series of comparisons between personal and social immune systems—she explained that her definition of social immunity encompassed [...] "the nature of these defences that they cannot be performed efficiently by single individuals, but depend strictly on the cooperation {{of at least two}} individuals". However, in 2010, Sheena Cotter and Rebecca Kilner (both then at the University of Cambridge) proposed to widen the definition of social immunity to [...] "any type of immune response that has been selected to increase the fitness of the challenged individual and one or more recipients", and recommended that the phenomena described by Cremer be known as collective immunity. This definition places importance on the evolutionary origin of behaviours rather than on their functional role at present; Cotter and Kilner explained that their broader definition would include immune behaviours in both animal families and social microbes as well as situations where herd immunity exists due to investment in personal immunity, arguing that this allowed for investigations of the evolution of social immunity to have a [...] "greater depth than would otherwise be possible". They further suggested that the evolution of social immunity be seen as one of the major transitions in evolution. Joël Meunier (University of Mainz) proposed a further redefinition in his 2015 paper on the role of social immunity in the evolution of group living, suggesting that Cotter and Kilner's definition could problematically encompass immune defences which arise not due to social life but due to shared location; Meunier defines a social immune system as [...] "any collective and personal mechanism that has emerged and/or is maintained at least partly due to the <b>anti-parasite</b> defence it provides to other group members".|$|E

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} is {{a common}} tumor in Asia and Africa area. Tryptanthrin is a weakly basic alkaloid and {{has been reported to}} have various functions, such as anti-microorganisms, <b>anti-parasites,</b> immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activity in vitro. In this study, we examined the efficacy of tryptanthrin in suppression hepatoma growth and further investigated the mechanism by which tryptanthrin alter tumor cell growth. Tryptanthrin significantly inhibited human hepatoma cell proliferation in vitro. However, our data showed that tryptanthrin did not alter expression or activity of caspase proteins, which was different from previous studies on this compound. Tryptanthrin increased intracellular reactive oxygen species and decreased the expression of growth-related proteins. Furthermore, the levels of apoptosis-related protein in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were significantly increased by tryptanthrin treatment. Fluorescence microscope observation further discovered the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-related proteins and their nuclear condensation in tryptanthrin-treated cells. We suggest that tryptanthrin enhanced reactive oxygen species level that led to loss of mitochondrial potential in human hepatoma cells, followed by the activation of apoptotic protein release. The in vivo study subsequently showed that tryptanthrin supplementation inhibited tumor growth in BALB/c nu/nu athymic mice with human hepatoma cell xenograft. Tryptanthrin supplementation increased the number of apoptosis-related protein cells in tumors. The present study suggested that tryptanthrin may have anti-tumor potential in humans. 肝癌是國人重大癌症之一，在台灣地區肝癌預防及開發具有潛力的肝癌治療化合物相當重要。色胺酮是由中草藥靛藍植物所分離出的成分之一，其為生物鹼具有抗微生物、抗寄生蟲、增強免疫調節和抗癌細胞等功能。我們過去的研究顯示靛藍植物萃取物具有抑制肝癌細胞生長的效果, 因此本研究繼續探討靛藍植物萃取物中之化合物色胺酮對肝癌細胞生長的影響，並探討其抑制癌細胞增生的可能作用機制。以色胺酮對肝癌細胞抑制 50 % 的藥物濃度做實驗之結果顯示，色胺酮會引起細胞內活性氧自由基物種增加，並使粒線體膜電位下降。推測色胺酮引起的肝癌細胞凋亡有可能是藉由影響細胞內粒線體通透性, 進一步釋放細胞凋亡蛋白繼而引起癌細胞死亡。進一步以細胞螢光免疫染色發現特定細胞凋亡蛋白從粒線體釋放細胞質並進入到細胞核中, 引起凋亡。西方點墨實驗顯示,影響細胞生長的特定蛋白表現降低，但caspase 蛋白表現及活性均未受影響。在免疫不全的裸鼠皮下注射人類肝癌細胞，發現餵食色胺酮的裸鼠其癌組織細胞核內的特定凋亡蛋白表現顯著的增加。根據以上實驗結果推測, 色胺酮具有抑制肝癌細胞增生及促進其凋亡的潛力。Contents 中文摘要……………………………………………………………iii ABSTRACT……………………………………………………………iv INTRODUCTION……………………………………………………… 1 MATERIAL AND METHODS…………………………………………… 3 RESULT……………………………………………………………… 10 DISCUSSIONS……………………………………………………… 16 FIGURES Figure 1.

The direct counting of nematode eggs in feces is the method of choice for yearling animals, whereas in adult animals it may yield high variability due to a cow’s immunity and low egg output.Other biochemical methods {{have been developed to}} help more accurately diagnose O. ostertagi parasitism.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have been used as a diagnostic tool to quantify the impact of gastrointestinal nematodes in dairy cattle by measuring antibodies in milk. Higher levels of antibodies measured by ELISA methods, referred to as optical density ratios (ODRs), are associated with decreased milk production in dairy cattle. Similar results have been established in the dairy industry between increased ODR and negative effects on health, body weight and reproductive measures Blood pepsinogen concentration, which increases with abomasal mucosa injury has also been used to diagnose ostertagiosis. The analysis of sera for increased plasma pepsinogen levels is a useful diagnostic aid.

However, we did not detect a relationship between the presence of anti-glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) antibodies in the serum and asymptomatic malaria infection, although we did register a relationship between these antibodies and parasitemia levels in infected individuals. Taken together, these results indicate that autoimmune responses mediated by AAb of different specificities, including phospholipid, may have anti-plasmodial activity and protect against malaria, although {{it is not clear whether}} <b>anti-parasite</b> phospholipid antibodies can mediate the same effect. The potential effect of <b>anti-parasite</b> phospholipid antibodies in malarious patients that are prone to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome, as well as the (possibly protective?) role of the (pathogenic) aPL on the malaria symptomatology and severity in these individuals, remain open questions...|$|E
40|$|Parasites often exert severe {{negative}} effects upon their host's fitness. Natural selection has therefore prompted {{the evolution of}} <b>anti-parasite</b> mechanisms such as grooming. Grooming is efficient at reducing parasitic loads in both birds and mammals, but the energetic costs it entails have not been properly quantified. We measured both the energetic metabolism and behaviour of greater mouse-eared bats submitted to three different parasite loads (no, 20 and 40 mites) during whole daily cycles. Mites greatly affected their time and energy budgets. They caused increased grooming activity, reduced the overall time devoted to resting and provoked a dramatic shortening of resting bout duration. Correspondingly, the bats' overall metabolism (oxygen consumption) increased drastically with parasite intensity and, {{during the course of}} experiments, the bats lost more weight when infested with 40 rather than 20 or no parasites. The short-term energetic constraints induced by <b>anti-parasite</b> grooming are probably associated with long-term detrimental effects such as a decrease in survival and overall reproductive value...|$|E
40|$|Higher interclutch colour {{variation}} can evolve {{under the pressure}} of brood parasitism to increase the detection of parasitic eggs. Nest sanitation could be a prerequisite for the evolution of <b>anti-parasite</b> defence in terms of egg ejection. In this respect, we used nest sanitation behaviour as a tool to identify: i) motivation and its underlying function and, ii) which features provoke ejection behaviour. Therefore, we experimentally tested whether size, colour or shape may influence ejection behaviour using artificial flat objects. We found a high interclutch variation in egg colouration and egg size in our tree sparrow (Passer montanus) population. Using colour and size we were in fact able to predict clutch affiliation for each egg. Our experiments further revealed the existence of direct <b>anti-parasite</b> behaviours and birds are able to recognise conspecific eggs, since only experimentally-deposited eggs have been removed. Moreover, experiments with different objects revealed that the motivation of tree sparrows to remove experimental objects from their nests was highest during egg laying for objects of varying size, most likely because of parasitism risk at this breeding stage. In contrary, motivation to remove white objects and objects with edges was higher during incubation stage as behavioural patterns connected to hatching started to emerge. The fact that rejection rate of our flat objects was higher than real egg ejection, suggests that egg ejection in tree sparrows and probably more general in small passerines, to be limited by elevated costs to eject eggs with their beaks. The presence of <b>anti-parasite</b> behaviour supports our suggestion that brood parasitism causes variation i...|$|E
40|$|Parasites are {{important}} drivers of ecological and evolutionary processes in their hosts. However, hosts often differ {{in how they}} are affected by parasitism, which can be important in how parasite effects on individuals scale up to the population level. Hosts may differ intrinsically in their susceptibility to parasitism, and extrinsic factors may impose constraints on how hosts allocate resources between immunity, maintenance and reproduction, thereby further affecting their {{ability to cope with}} infection. These extrinsic factors include the host’s ecological environment, for example food availability or weather, and its social environment, that is its interactions with conspecifics. This is particularly true during a reproductive attempt when individuals interact closely with other family members. Not only might immediate impacts of parasitism differ between and within parents and offspring, but the direct effects of parasitism on a host could have further indirect consequences for other family members through their behavioural interactions with parasitised individuals. The distribution of direct and indirect effects among all family members could affect the outcome of the breeding event and individuals’ future performance. However, teasing apart these various avenues of parasite impacts on families may be difficult if parasite burden or susceptibility is correlated between family members. In this thesis, I explore the consequences of parasitism for different family members of the European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis infected with gastrointestinal nematodes, over a range of ecological conditions. In chapter 2, I demonstrate that chicks’ responses to <b>anti-parasite</b> treatment across four years vary between siblings and with environmental conditions, which may be mediated by resource allocation among siblings. In chapter 3, I explore how costs of parasitism are distributed among the whole family by simultaneously treating chicks and/or parents with an <b>anti-parasite</b> drug and measuring the outcomes for all family members. Treatment has a more marked effect for the non-treated generation than for the treated individuals, suggesting that parasitism may have important indirect costs. In chapter 4, I investigate whether within-brood variability in the effects of <b>anti-parasite</b> treatment and its cross-generational impacts are mediated by behavioural change, and show that chick treatment but not parent treatment influences several aspects of behaviour in the nest. In chapter 5, I demonstrate that the impact of chick <b>anti-parasite</b> treatment on parents persists beyond the breeding attempt, with parents of treated chicks foraging less overwinter and breeding earlier the following year, whereas there is no persistent effect of parents’ own <b>anti-parasite</b> treatment. Lastly, I provide an appendix examining the parasitology of the system in detail, including an assessment of in situ and proxy measures of worm burdens of chicks. This thesis demonstrates that parasitism can be a key component, previously overlooked, of reproductive performance in seabirds, a group that plays an important ecological role as apex predators and thus indicator species of the marine environment...|$|E
40|$|Human {{cervicovaginal}} secretions {{were obtained}} from patients at the Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinics at National Taiwan University Hospital and Cathay General Hospital, Republic of China. Among the 500 patients examined, 33 (6. 6 %) were infected with Trichomonas vaginalis {{as determined by the}} culture method. Secretions from 24 of the infected patients and 30 noninfected women were assayed for anti-T. vaginalis immunoglobulins by the indirect immunofluorescent antibody technique. A few serum samples from both infected and noninfected persons were also included in this study. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody against T. vaginalis was detected in 17 (70. 8 %) secretions from the infected women. Among the 17 positive secretions, <b>anti-parasite</b> IgA was found in two specimens, IgE was found in three, and IgM was found in one. Of the 30 secretions, 7 (23. 3 %) from noninfected women also contained <b>anti-parasite</b> IgG. Low levels of natural anti-trichomonad IgG and IgM were detected in the sera of normal persons. Infection with T. vaginalis caused an increase in the serum IgG antibody titer. Cross-reaction between T. vaginalis and Pentatrichomonas hominis was also observed...|$|E
