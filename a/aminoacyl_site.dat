25|$|The {{ribosome}} {{has three}} sites for tRNA to bind. They are the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site</b> (abbreviated A), the peptidyl site (abbreviated P) and the exit site (abbreviated E). With {{respect to the}} mRNA, the three sites are oriented 5’ to 3’ E-P-A, because ribosomes move toward the 3' end of mRNA. The A site binds the incoming tRNA with the complementary codon on the mRNA. The P site holds the tRNA with the growing polypeptide chain. The E site holds the tRNA without its amino acid. When an aminoacyl-tRNA initially binds to its corresponding codon on the mRNA, {{it is in the}} A site. Then, a peptide bond forms between the amino acid of the tRNA in the A site and the amino acid of the charged tRNA in the P site. The growing polypeptide chain is transferred to the tRNA in the A site. Translocation occurs, moving the tRNA in the P site, now without an amino acid, to the E site; the tRNA that was in the A site, now charged with the polypeptide chain, is moved to the P site. The tRNA in the E site leaves and another aminoacyl-tRNA enters the A site to repeat the process.|$|E

50|$|Termination {{of protein}} {{biosynthesis}} and {{release of the}} nascent polypeptide chain are signaled {{by the presence of}} an in-frame stop codon at the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site</b> of the ribosome. The process of translation termination is universal and is mediated by protein release factors (RFs) and GTP. A class 1 RF recognizes the stop codon and promotes the hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the polypeptide chain with the peptidyl site tRNA, a reaction catalyzed at the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome. Class 2 RFs, which are not codon specific and do not recognize codons, stimulate class 1 RF activity and confer GTP dependency upon the process. In prokaryotes, both class 1 RFs, RF1 and RF2, recognize UAA; however, UAG and UGA are decoded specifically by RF1 and RF2, respectively. In eukaryotes, eRF1, or ETF1, the functional counterpart of RF1 and RF2, functions as an omnipotent RF, decoding all 3 stop codons.|$|E

In all cases, the modified tRNAs became crosslinked exclusively to 50 S ribosomal subunits. While the tRNA derivative containing 2 N 3 A at position 73 labeled only protein L 27, that containing 2 N 3 A at position 76 labeled proteins L 15, L 16, and L 27 as well as a segment of the 23 S rRNA. The site of crosslinking in the rRNA was identified as guanosine- 1945, which lies within a highly conserved sequence adjacent to a number of modified bases and has not until now been identified at the peptidyltransferase center. On the basis of these results, and previously reported crosslinks from tRNA containing 8 -azidoadenosine in the 3 '-terminal -A-C-C-A sequence [Wower, J., Hixson, S. S. & Zimmermann, R. A.

During tRNA movement one or more "hybrid" states (A/P) is occupied, but molecular details of them and of the translocation process are limited. Here we show by cryo-electron microscopy that a population of mammalian ribosomes stalled at an mRNA pseudoknot structure contains structurally distorted tRNAs in two different A/P hybrid states. In one (A/P'), the tRNA is in contact with the translocase EF- 2, which induces it. In the other (A/P''), the translocase is absent.

40|$|Two {{regions of}} the 16 S rRNA, helix 34, and the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site</b> {{component}} of the decoding site {{at the base of}} helix 44, have been implicated in decoding of translational stop signals during the termination of protein synthesis. Antibiotics specific for these regions have been tested to see how they discriminate the decoding of UAA, UAG, and UGA by the two polypeptide chain release factors (RF- 1 and RF- 2). Spectinomycin, which interacts with helix 34, stimulated RF- 1 dependent binding to the ribosome and termination. It also stimulated UGA dependent RF- 2 termination at micromolar concentrations but inhibited UGA dependent RF- 2 binding at higher concentrations. Alterations at position C 1192 of helix 34, known to confer spectinomycin resistance, reduced the binding of f[3 H]Met-tRNA to the peptidyl-tRNA site. They also impaired termination in vitro, with both factors and all three stop codons, although the effect was greater with RF- 2 mediated reactions. These alterations had previously been shown to inhibit EF-G mediated translocation. As perturbations in helix 34 effect both termination and elongation reactions, these results indicate that helix 34 is close to the decoding site on the bacterial ribosome. Several antibiotics, hygromycin, neomycin and tetracycline, specific for the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site,</b> were shown to inhibit the binding and function of both RFs in termination with all three stop codons in vitro.

We found that the regions of protection to nuclease afforded by the two proteins were distinct. p 19 protected primarily the two tips in the RNA secondary structure. p 68 / 72 protected a large region extending across {{the center of the}} particle and altered the nuclease pattern in the regions that p 19 would bind, suggesting that these two proteins may be in close proximity in the particle. The protection afforded by the two proteins in combination was equal to the sum of the individual protections. We have not observed cooperativity in the binding of these two proteins as assessed by the protection assay; nor do we have any evidence that the structure becomes more compact as it assembles. The map derived from this "footprint" analysis places the signal recognition domain (p 54 bound to the RNA via the 19 -kDa protein) and the elongation arrest domain (associated with the Alu end of the particle) on opposite ends of the particle. Thus, it is possible that SRP recognizes signals by the direct interaction of p 54 with the signal sequence at the nascent chain exit site and simultaneously blocks elongation by the entrance of p 9 / 14 into the <b>aminoacyl</b> tRNA <b>site</b> 16 nm away...|$|R

In this work, a derivative of nonaribonucleotide pUUCGUAAAA with nitroxide spin labels attached to the 5 ′-phosphate and to the C 8 atom of the adenosine in sixth position (mRNA analog) was used for studying such complexes using double electron-electron resonance/pulsed electron-electron double resonance spectroscopy. The complexes were assembled with participation of tRNAPhe, which targeted triplet UUC of the derivative to the ribosomal peptidyl site and predetermined location of the adjacent GUA triplet coding for Val at the <b>aminoacyl</b> (A) <b>site.</b> The interspin distances were measured between the two labels of mRNA analog attached to the first nucleotide of the peptidyl site bound codon and to the third nucleotide of the A site bound codon, in the absence/presence of second tRNA bound at the A site. The values of the obtained interspin distances agree with those calculated for available near-atomic structures of similar complexes of 40 S and 80 S ribosomes, showing that neither 60 S subunit nor tRNA at the A site have a noticeable effect on arrangement of mRNA at the codon-anticodon interaction area. In addition, the shapes of distance distributions in four studied ribosomal complexes allowed conclusions on conformational flexibility of mRNA in these complexes.

Only the direct evidences obtained in this laboratory will be presented and discussed. It has been unequivocally shown that the interaction between 16 S and 23 S RNAs plays the primary role in the association of ribosomal subunits. Further, 23 S RNA is responsible for the binding of 5 S RNA to 16 S. 23 S RNA complex with the help of three ribosomal proteins, L 5, L 18, L 15 /L 25. The 16 S. 23 S RNA complex is also capable of carrying out the following ribosomal functions, although to small but significant extents, {{with the help of a}} very limited number of ribosomal proteins and the factors involved in protein synthesis: (a) poly U-binding, (b) poly U-dependent binding of phenylalanyl tRNA, (c) EF-G-dependent GTPase activity, (d) initiation complex formation, (e) peptidyl transferase activity (puromycin reaction) and (f) polyphenylalanine synthesis. These results clearly indicate the direct involvement of rRNAs in the various steps of protein synthesis. Very recently it has been demonstrated that the conformational change of 23 S RNA is responsible for the translocation of peptidyl tRNA from the <b>aminoacyl</b> (A) <b>site</b> to the peptidyl (Ρ) site.

40|$|The {{plasmid gene}} cat- 86 {{specifies}} chloramphenicol-inducible chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in Bacillus subtilis. Induction by the antibiotic is {{primarily due to}} activation of the translation of cat- 86 -encoded mRNA. It {{has been suggested that}} the inducer stalls ribosomes at a discrete location in the leader region of cat- 86 mRNA, which causes the destabilization of a downstream RNA secondary structure that normally sequesters the cat- 86 ribosome binding site. It is the destabilization of this RNA secondary structure that permits translation of the cat- 86 coding sequence. In the present report, we show that ribosomes that were stalled in the cat- 86 leader by starvation of host cells for the amino acid specified by leader codon 6 induced gene expression to a level above that detected when cells were starved for the amino acids specified by leader codons 7 and 8. Starvation for amino acids specified by leader codons 3, 4, or 5 failed to activate cat- 86 expression. These results indicate that the stalled ribosome that is most active in cat- 86 induction has its <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site</b> occupied by leader codon 6. To determine if chloramphenicol also stalled ribosomes in the cat- 86 regulatory leader such that the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site</b> was occupied by codon 6, we separately changed leader codons 3, 4, 5, and 6 to the translation termination (ochre) codon TAA. Each of the mutated genes was tested for its ability to be induced by chloramphenicol. The results show that replacement of leader codons 3, 4, or 5 by the ochre codon blocked induction, whereas replacement of leader codon 6 by the ochre codon permitted induction. Collectively, these observations lead to the conclusion that cat- 86 induction requires ribosome stalling in leader mRNA, and they identify leader codon 6 as the codon most likely to be occupied by the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site</b> of a stalled ribosome that is active in the induction...|$|E

40|$|For the {{functional}} {{role of the}} ribosomal tRNA exit (E) site, two different models have been proposed. It {{has been suggested that}} transient E-site binding of the tRNA leaving the peptidyl (P) site promotes elongation factor G (EF-G) -dependent translocation by lowering the energetic barrier of tRNA release [Lill, R., Robertson, J. M. & Wintermeyer, W. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 3933 - 3938]. The alternative "allosteric three-site model" [Nierhaus, K. H. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 4997 - 5008] features stable, codon-dependent tRNA binding to the E site and postulates a coupling between E and <b>aminoacyl</b> (A) <b>sites</b> that regulates the tRNA binding affinity of the two sites in an anticooperative manner. Extending our testing of the two conflicting models, we have performed translocation experiments with fully active ribosomes programmed with heteropolymeric mRNA. The results confirm that the deacylated tRNA released from the P site is bound to the E site in a kinetically labile fashion, and that the affinity of binding, i. e., the occupancy of the E site, is increased by Mg 2 + or polyamines. At conditions of high E-site occupancy in the posttranslocation complex, filling the A site with aminoacyl-tRNA had no influence on the E site, i. e., there was no detectable anticooperative coupling between the two sites, provided that second-round translocation was avoided by removing EF-G. On the basis of these results, which are entirely consistent with our previous results, we consider the allosteric three-site model of elongation untenable. Rather, as proposed earlier, the E site-bound state of the leaving tRNA is a transient intermediate and, as such, is a mechanistic feature of the classic two-state model of the elongating ribosome...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Transfer RNA (tRNA) is an RNA {{molecule}} {{that carries}} amino acids to the ribosomes for protein synthesis. These tRNAs function at the peptidyl (P) and <b>aminoacyl</b> (A) binding <b>sites</b> of the ribosome during translation, with each codon being recognized by a specific tRNA. Due to this specificity, tRNA modification {{is essential for}} translational efficiency. Many enzymes have been implicated in the modification of bacterial tRNAs, and these enzymes may complex with one another or interact individually with the tRNA. Approximately, 100 tRNA modification enzymes have been identified with glucose-inhibited division (GidA) protein and MnmE being two of the enzymes studied.

40|$|Summary Reversible protein {{phosphorylation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important mechanisms for regulation and coordination of cellular processes, and is uttered through the actions of protein kinases and phosphatases. One of the best characterised protein kinases is cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). PKA is a holoenzyme which consists of a regulatory (R) dimer and two catalytic (C) subunits. Humans have at least four genes that express four isoforms of the C subunits, designated Cá, Câ, Cã and PrKX. Both the Cá and the Câ genes express splice variants, all of which differ in the N-terminal part encoded by the exons located upstream of exon 2. How specificity is maintained in the cAMP-PKA pathway is not fully understood but involves targeting of the R subunit dimer to subcellular structures through proteins that are termed A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). There is one problem with maintaining specificity by using this model. That is, when the PKA holoenzyme is challenged with cAMP the C subunits are released from the R-AKAP complex, which will leave the C subunits free to unspecifically phosphorylate targets in the cytosol and the nucleus. However, this is not the case, and hence it has been speculated as to the existence of C subunit binding proteins both in the cytosol and nucleus. The C binding proteins will target the C subunit in close proximity to its substrate, and in this way increase the level of specificity in the cAMP-PKA signalling pathway. Indeed, today seven C binding proteins have been identified, of which three are cytosolic; inhibitor of NF-êB (IêB), Caveolin- 1, and p 75 neurotrophin receptor (p 75 NTR), two are strictly nuclear; homologous to AKAP 95 (HA 95) and A kinase interacting protein (AKIP) and last is the protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) which is located both to the cytosol and the nucleus. In order to identify more C binding partners, Câ 2 was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human peripheral blood cell cDNA library. This was performed by the company Dualsystems Biotech. In addition to the PKA R subunit RI, a novel potential binding partner was identified as the nearly ubiquitously expressed eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eEF 1 A 1). eEF 1 A 1 is associated with ribosome activity and protein synthesis and brings the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA in a GTP-dependent manner to a site within the ribosome referred to as the <b>aminoacyl</b> (A) <b>site.</b> In this Master thesis the eEF 1 A 1 was further characterised by applying PCR cloning, eukaryote expression, immunofluoresence and immunoprecipitation. This demonstrated that eEF 1 A 1 was mainly located in the cell cytosol, and associated with all the various PKA C subunits tested which included Câ 1, Câ 2, Câ 4 as well as Cá 1. Our data implies that we have identified a novel binding partner for the C subunit of PKA expressed in all tissues except differentiated skeletal muscle, linking the regulatory role of the cAMP-PKA signalling pathway to protein synthesis...|$|R

40|$|The {{regulation}} of protein synthesis {{is critical in}} viral infection, cell death, and development. Most {{regulation of}} translation occurs during the rate-limiting step of translation initiation, {{the process by which}} the ribosome binds to and positions initiator tRNA and messenger RNA at the initiation (AUG) codon. An understanding of the detailed mechanisms of this initiation process is critical to our understanding of translational control in biology. This work discusses the molecular mechanisms by which messenger RNA is recruited to human 40 S ribosomal subunits during translation initiation and positioned correctly in the mRNA binding cleft and our efforts to inhibit this process in the lifecycle of Hepatitis C virus. Eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF 3) was previously thought to bind primarily to the solvent side of 40 S ribosomal subunits, and the principal role of the eIF 3 j subunit during translation initiation was believed to be facilitating eIF 3 binding to 40 S subunits. The C-terminal domain of human eIF 3 j is now known to bind in the mRNA binding cleft and <b>aminoacyl</b> (A) <b>site</b> of the 40 S ribosomal subunit. We utilized a recombinant biochemical system of human initiation factors to biophysically examine eIF 3 j's interaction with mRNA and interface binding factors to define the role of this eIF 3 subunit in the translation initiation pathway. We demonstrate that eIF 3 j interacts directly or indirectly with eIF 1 A on the 40 S subunit. We also show that eIF 3 j influences the interaction of mRNA with the 40 S subunit's mRNA binding cleft during translation initiation, reducing mRNA's affinity for 40 S subunits until eIF 2 -tRNAimet-GTP (TC) is present. These biochemical observations help to explain why deletion of eIF 3 j from S. cerevisiae leads to a leaky scanning phenotype. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a considerable global health problem for which new classes of therapeutics are needed. The HCV genomic RNA contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in its upstream untranslated region (UTR), the structure of which is essential for viral protein translation. We developed a high-throughput assay to identify compounds that selectively block translation initiation from the HCV IRES. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate conditions were optimized to faithfully report on authentic HCV IRES-dependent translation relative to a capped mRNA control. Despite well-optimized in vitro translation conditions, no selective HCV IRES inhibitors were found in the end, as the vast majority of hits proved to be luciferase and general translation inhibitors. The analysis of these molecules, and the finding that a large fraction of false positives resulted from off-target effects, highlights the challenges inherent in screens for RNA-specific inhibitors. The HCV IRES faces a challenge in that the majority of its structure binds to the solvent side of the 40 S subunit, yet its initiation codon needs to reach the P site in the mRNA binding cleft, and must do so without the many cap-binding and scanning factors used by a cellular message. The IRES includes a predicted pseudoknot interaction near the AUG start codon, but the results of previous studies of its structure have been conflicting. Using mutational analysis coupled with activity and functional assays, we verified the importance of pseudoknot base pairings for IRES-mediated translation, and conducted a comprehensive study of the structural tolerance and functional contributions of the pseudoknot. Ribosomal toeprinting experiments show that the entirety of the pseudoknot element positions the initiation codon in the mRNA binding cleft of the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Optimal spacing between the pseudoknot and the start site AUG resembles that between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the initiation codon in bacterial mRNAs. In addition, we validated the HCV IRES pseudoknot as a potential drug target using antisense oligonucleotides. Initial steps have been taken to solve a high-resolution structure of this IRES pseudoknot domain...|$|R
40|$|Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are at {{the center}} of the {{question}} of the origin of life and are essential proteins found in all living organisms. AARSs arose early in evolution to interpret genetic code and are believed to be a group of ancient proteins. They constitute a family of enzymes integrating the two levels of cellular organization: nucleic acids and proteins. These enzymes ensure the fidelity of transfer of genetic information from the DNA to the protein. They are responsible for attaching amino acid residues to their cognate tRNA molecules by virtue of matching the nucleotide triplet, which is the first step in the protein synthesis. The translation of genetic code into protein sequence is mediated by tRNA, which accurately picks up the cognate amino acids. The attachment of the cognate amino acid to tRNA is catalyzed by aaRSs, which have binding sites for the anticodon region of tRNA and for the amino acid to be attached. The two binding sites are separated by ≈ 76 Å and experiments have shown that the communication does not go through tRNA (Gale et al., 1996). The problem addressed here is how the information of binding of tRNA anticodon near the anticodon binding site is communicated to the active site through the protein structure. These enzymes are modular with distinct domains on which extensive kinetic and mutational experiments and supported by structural data are available, highlighting the role of inter-domain communication (Alexander and Schimmel, 2001). Hence these proteins present themselves as excellent systems for in-silico studies. Various methods involved for the construction of protein structure networks are well established and analyzed in a variety of ways to gain insights into different aspects of protein structure, stability and function (Kannan and Vishveshwara, 1999; Brinda and Vishveshwara, 2005). In the present study, we have incorporated network parameters for the analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data, representing the global dynamic behavior of protein in a more elegant way. MD simulations have been performed on the available (and modeled) structures of aaRSs bound to a variety of ligands, and the protein structure networks (PSN) of non-covalent interactions have been characterized in dynamical equilibrium. The changes in the structure networks are used to understand the mode of communication, and the paths between the two sites of interest identified by the analysis of the shortest path. The allosteric concept has played a key role in understanding the biological functions of aaRSs. The rigidity/plasticity and the conformational population are the two important ideas invoked in explaining the allosteric effect. We have explored the conformational changes in the complexes of aaRSs through novel parameters such as cliques and communities (Palla et al., 2005), which identify the rigid regions in the protein structure networks (PSNs) constructed from the non-covalent interactions of amino acid side chains. The thesis consists of 7 chapters. The first chapter constitutes the survey of the literature and also provides suitable background for this study. The aims of the thesis are presented in this chapter. Chapter 2 describes various techniques employed and the new techniques developed for the analysis of PSNs. It includes a brief description of well -known methods of molecular dynamics simulations, essential dynamics, and cross correlation maps. The method used for the construction of graphs and networks is also described in detail. The incorporation of network parameters for the analysis of MD simulation data are done for the first time and has been applied on a well studied protein lysozyme, as described in chapter 3. Chapter 3 focuses on the dynamical behavior of protein structure networks, examined by considering the example of T 4 -lysozyme. The equilibrium dynamics and the process of unfolding are followed by simulating the protein with explicit water molecules at 300 K and at higher temperatures (400 K, 500 K) respectively. Three simulations of 10 ns duration have been performed at 500 K to ensure the validity of the results. The snapshots of the protein structure from the simulations are represented as Protein Structure Networks (PSN) of non-covalent interactions. The strength of the non-covalent interaction is evaluated and used as an important criterion in the construction of edges. The profiles of the network parameters such as the degree distribution and the size of the largest cluster (giant component) have been examined as a function of interaction strength (Ghosh et al., 2007). We observe a critical strength of interaction (Icritical) at which there is a transition in the size of the largest cluster. Although the transition profiles at all temperatures show behavior similar to those found in the crystal structures, the 500 K simulations show that the non-native structures have lower Icritical values. Based on the interactions evaluated at Icritical value, the folding/unfolding transition region has been identified from the 500 K simulation trajectories. Furthermore, the residues in the largest cluster obtained at interaction strength higher than Icritical have been identified to be important for folding. Thus, the compositions of the top largest clusters in the 500 K simulations have been monitored to understand the dynamical processes such as folding/unfolding and domain formation/disruption. The results correlate well with experimental findings. In addition, the highly connected residues in the network have been identified from the 300 K and 400 K simulations and have been correlated with the protein stability as determined from mutation experiments. Based on these analyses, certain residues, on which experimental data is not available, have been predicted to be important for the folding and the stability of the protein. The method can also be employed as a valuable tool in the analysis of MD simulation data, since it captures the details at a global level, which may elude conventional pair-wise interaction analysis. After standardizing the concept of dynamical network analysis using Lysozyme, it was applied to our system of interest, the aaRSs. The investigations carried out on Methionyl-tRNA synthetases (MetRS) are presented in chapter 4. This chapter is divided into three parts: Chapter 4 A deals with the introduction to aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS). Classification and functional insights of aaRSs obtained through various studies are presented. Chapter 4 B is again divided into parts: BI and BII. Chapter 4 BI elucidates a new technique developed for finding communication pathways essential for proper functioning of aaRS. The enzymes of the family of tRNA synthetases perform their functions with high precision, by synchronously recognizing the anticodon region and the amino acylation region, which is separated by about 70 Å in space. This precision in function is brought about by establishing good communication paths between the two regions. We have modelled the structure of E. coli Methionyl tRNA synthetase, which is complexed with tRNA and activated methionine. Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed on the modeled structure to obtain the equilibrated structure of the complex and the cross correlations between the residues in MetRS. Furthermore, the network analysis on these structures has been carried out to elucidate the paths of communication between the <b>aminoacyl</b> activation <b>site</b> and the anticodon recognition site (Ghosh and Vishveshwara, 2007). This study has provided the detailed paths of communication, which are consistent with experimental results. A similar study on the (MetRS + activated methionine) and (MetRS+tRNA) complexes along with ligand free-native enzyme has also been carried out. A comparison of the paths derived from the four simulations has clearly shown that the communication path is strongly correlated and unique to the enzyme complex, which is bound to both the tRNA and the activated methionine. The method developed here could also be utilized to investigate any protein system where the function takes place through long distance communication. The details of the method of our investigation and the biological implications of the results are presented in this chapter. In chapter 4 BII, we have explored the conformational changes in the complexes of E. coli Methionyl tRNA synthetase (MetRS) through novel parameters such as cliques and communities, which identify the rigid regions in the protein structure networks (PSNs). The rigidity/plasticity and the conformational population are the two important ideas invoked in explaining the allosteric effect. MetRS belongs to the aminoacyl tRNA Synthetases (aaRSs) family that play a crucial role in initiating the protein synthesis process. The network parameters evaluated here on the conformational ensembles of MetRS complexes, generated from molecular dynamics simulations, have enabled us to understand the inter-domain communication in detail. Additionally, the characterization of conformational changes in terms of cliques/communities has also become possible, which had eluded conventional analyses. Furthermore, we find that most of the residues participating in clique/communities are strikingly different from those that take part in long-range communication. The cliques/communities evaluated here for the first time on PSNs have beautifully captured the local geometries in their detail within the framework of global topology. Here the allosteric effect is revealed at the residue level by identifying the important residues specific for structural rigidity and functional flexibility in MetRS. Chapter 4 C focuses on MD simulations of Methionyl tRNA synthetase (AmetRS) from a thermophilic bacterium, Aquifex aeolicus. As describe in Chapter 4 B, we have explored the communication pathways between the anticodon binding region and the aminoacylation site, and the|$|R

An emerging aminoglycoside resistance mechanism, methylation of the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site</b> of the 16 S rRNA, confers high-level resistance to clinically important aminoglycosides such as amikacin, tobramycin and gentamicin. Eight 16 S rRNA methyltransferase genes, armA, rmtA, rmtB, rmtC, rmtD, rmtE, rmtF and npmA, have been identified in several species of enterobacteria worldwide (2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14). Resistance to extended spectrum β-lactams remains additionally an important clinical problem. Apart from the large TEM, SHV, and CTX-M families, several other extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) have been identified, including VEB enzymes, which confer high-level resistance to cephalosporins and monobactams. Although 16 S rRNA methyltransferases have been frequently identified associated with different ESBLs, there has been no report of association of a 16 S rRNA methyltransferase with a VEB enzyme, except for the identification of rmtC with blaVEB- 6 (14...|$|E
40|$|Translocation in ribosomes {{consists}} of transposition of peptidyl-tRNA from the aminoacyl to the peptidyl site and, probably concomitantly, {{the movement of}} ribosomes on mRNA. Does a conformational change in the ribosome provide the motive force for this process? Hydrogen exchange and sedimentation velocity experiments indicate that the Escherichia coli ribosome does undergo a conformational change associated with translocation. When pretranslocational ribosomes carrying acetyldiphenylalanyl-tRNA in the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site</b> were incubated with G factor and GTP, translocation occurred, with a concomitant increase in hydrogen exchange rate {{and a decrease in}} sedimentation constant. These changes did not occur when GTP was replaced by a nonhydrolyzable analogue, GDP-CH 2 -P, and they were blocked by the antibiotics fusidic acid and thiostrepton. When posttranslocational ribosomes were cycled back to the pretranslocational state by T factor, GTP, and phenylalanyl-tRNA, the sedimentation constant reverted to the original value. Whether or not this conformation change drives translocation requires further study...|$|E
40|$|Previously, we {{reported}} that the antibiotic kirromycin induces two tRNA-binding sites on the elongation factor Tu. The classical binding site (site I) binds aminoacyl-tRNA and, with much less affinity, deacylated tRNA. The kirromycin-induced site II binds aminoacyl-tRNA, peptidyl-tRNA, and deacylated tRNA with comparable affinities. Accordingly, 3 '-oxidized tRNA can be cross-linked {{in the presence of}} the antibiotic to two specific sites of EF-Tu: Lys- 237 and Lys- 208. Here, we report that 3 '-oxidized tRNAPhe, bound to a ribosome-poly(U) complex, can also be cross-linked to either one of these two sites. When located in the ribosomal peptidyl site, it cross-links exclusively to Lys- 208; when located in the ribosomal <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site,</b> it cross-links exclusively to Lys- 237, irrespective of the presence of kirromycin. Since no cross-linking could be detected in the absence of ribosomes and kirromycin, we conclude that the tRNA-binding site II is induced upon interaction of aminoacyl-tRNA-EF-Tu-GTP with the ribosome-mRNA complex. The results indicate that, on the ribosome, EF-Tu interacts with peptidyl-site-bound peptidyl-tRNA through tRNA-binding site II and with aminoacyl-site-bound aminoacyl-tRNA through tRNA-binding site I...|$|E
40|$|Translational {{attenuation}} {{has been}} proposed to be the mechanism by which the erm(B) gene is induced. Here, we report genetic and biochemical evidence, obtained by using erythromycin as the inducing antibiotic, that supports this hypothesis. We also show that erythromycin increases {{the level of the}} erm(B) transcript by stalling the ribosome on the leader mRNA and thereby facilitating the stabilization and processing of the mRNA. Erythromycin-induced mRNA stabilization and processing were observed with an ochre stop at codons 11 to 13 of the leader but not with an ochre stop at codon 10. This suggests that erythromycin does not stall the ribosome before codon 11 of the leader reaches the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site.</b> Secondary structure analyses of the erm(B) transcripts by in vitro and in vivo chemical probing techniques identified conformational changes in the transcripts that result from induction by erythromycin. These findings demonstrate that stalling of erythromycin-bound ribosomes at leader codon 11 causes the refolding of mRNA into a conformation in which the translational initiation site for the structural gene is unmasked and renders erm(B) translationally active...|$|E
40|$|Using single-molecule {{fluorescence}} spectroscopy, time-resolved conformational changes between fluorescently labeled tRNA {{have been}} characterized within surface-immobilized ribosomes proceeding through a complete cycle of translation elongation. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer {{was used to}} observe aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) stably accommodating into the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site</b> (A site) of the ribosome via a multistep, elongation factor-Tu dependent process. Subsequently, tRNA molecules, bound at the peptidyl site and A site, fluctuate between two configurations assigned as classical and hybrid states. The lifetime of classical and hybrid states, measured for complexes carrying aa-tRNA and peptidyl-tRNA at the A site, shows that peptide bond formation decreases the lifetime of the classical-state tRNA configuration by ≈ 6 -fold. These {{data suggest that the}} growing peptide chain plays a role in modulating fluctuations between hybrid and classical states. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer was also used to observe aa-tRNA accommodation coupled with elongation factor G-mediated translocation. Dynamic rearrangements in tRNA configuration are also observed subsequent to the translocation reaction. This work underscores the importance of dynamics in ribosome function and demonstrates single-particle enzymology in a system of more than two components...|$|E
40|$|Aminoglycosides are {{bactericidal}} {{agents that}} are used in the treatment of life-threatening infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens. They exert their antibacterial property by blocking the peptide bond-forming translocation process through binding to the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site</b> (A-site) of the 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) that constitutes the bacterial 30 S ribosome. 1 The most common mechanism of resistance to aminoglycosides by Gram-negative pathogens is the production of aminoglycoside modification enzymes such as acetyltransferases, adenylyltransferases and phosphotransferases. Resistance to aminoglycosides due to production of 16 S rRNA methylases has been reported for Gram-negative bacteria in recent years. 2 They methylate residue G 1405 in the A-site and confer high-level resistance to most injectable aminoglycosides including gentamicin, amikacin and tobramycin. Five such 16 S rRNA methylases have been identified: RmtA, RmtB, RmtC, RmtD and ArmA. Most recently, NpmA, which methylates A 1408 instead of G 1405, was reported from Escherichia coli in Japan, further adding to the diversity of this class of enzymes. 3 RmtD was initially found to be produced by a Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strain from Brazil. This particular strain also produced the metallo-β-lactamase SPM- 1. 4 It has been subsequently shown that RmtD i...|$|E
40|$|Production of 16 S rRNA methylase has {{recently}} drawn at-tention as a novel aminoglycoside resistance mechanism in pathogenic gram-negative bacteria (1). It confers very-high-level resistance to all aminoglycosides {{that are currently}} avail-able for parenteral formulation. Six distinct genes, rmtA, rmtB, rmtC, rmtD, armA, and npmA, encoding their respective en-zymes {{have been identified in}} clinical and veterinary strains from various geographic areas, including East Asia, Europe, and the Americas, since 2003 (1, 10). NpmA is the only enzyme among them that methylates residue A 1408, whereas the oth-ers methylate residue G 1405, both within the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site</b> (A site) of the 16 S rRNA (7, 10). All six genes are confirmed to be or are likely to locate on plasmids (3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 14). Recent findings also indicate that some of these genes are capable of crossing the barrier between glucose-fermenting and nonfer-menting species. For instance, armA has been identified in both members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and in Acineto-bacter baumannii (5, 13), and rmtD has been identified in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (unpub-lished data). We will likely see an increasing number of reports about this resistance mechanism, including identification of genes encoding new 16 S rRNA methylases. Historically, the nomenclature of genes and enzymes for many resistance mechanisms has become complicated and nonsystematic (6). An extreme example is that of aminoglyco-side acetyltransferases, where new gene names are arbitrarily assigned from one of the two coexisting nomenclature systems (9). The situation is somewhat better with -lactamases and macrolide resistance genes, due to a registry and guidelines, respectivel...|$|E
40|$|The {{stoichiometry}} of {{elongation factor}} Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP {{in the complex}} with aminoacyl-tRNA and the consumption of GTP during peptide bond formation on the ribosome were studied in the Escherichia coli system. The ribosomes were programmed either with two different heteropolymeric mRNAs coding for Met-Phe-Thr-Ile [...] . (mMFTI) or Met-Phe-Phe-Gly [...] . (mMFFG) or with poly(U). The composition of the complex of EF-Tu, GTP, and Phe-tRNA(Phe) was studied by gel chromatography. With equimolar amounts of factor and Phe-tRNA(Phe), a pentameric complex, (EF-Tu. GTP) 2. Phe-tRNA(Phe), was observed, whereas the classical ternary complex, EF-Tu. GTP. Phe-tRNA(Phe), was found only when Phe-tRNA(Phe) was in excess. Upon binding of the purified pentameric complex to ribosomes carrying fMet-tRNA(fMet) in the peptidyl site and exposing a Phe codon in the <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site,</b> {{only one out of}} two GTPs of the pentameric complex was hydrolyzed per Phe-tRNA bound and peptide bond formed, regardless of the mRNA used. In the presence of EF-G, the stoichiometry of one GTP hydrolyzed per peptide bond formed was found on mMFTI when one or two elongation cycles were completed. In contrast, on mMFFG, which contains two contiguous Phe codons, UUU-UUC, two GTP molecules of the pentameric complex were hydrolyzed per Phe incorporated into dipeptide, whereas the incorporation of the second Phe to form tripeptide consumed only one GTP. Thus, generally one GTP is hydrolyzed by EF-Tu per aminoacyl-tRNA bound and peptide bond formed, and more than one GTP is hydrolyzed only when a particular mRNA sequence, such as a homopolymeric stretch, is translated. The role of the additional GTP hydrolysis is not known; it may be related to frameshifting of peptidyl-tRNA during translocation...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} ribosome comprises 30  S and 50  S ribonucleoprotein subunits, {{contains a}} number of binding sites for known antibiotics and is an attractive target for selection of novel antibacterial agents. On the 30  S subunit, for example, the A site (<b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site)</b> close to the 3 ′-end of 16  S rRNA is highly important in the decoding process. Binding by some aminoglycoside antibiotics to the A site leads to erroneous protein synthesis and is lethal for bacteria. We targeted the A site on purified 30  S ribosomal subunits from Escherichia coli {{with a set of}} overlapping, complementary OMe (2 ′-O-methyl) 10 -mer oligoribonucleotides. An equilibrium dialysis technique was applied to measure dissociation constants of these oligonucleotides. We show that there is a single high-affinity region, spanning from A 1493 to C 1510 (Kd, 29 – 130  nM), flanked by two lower-affinity regions, within a span from U 1485 to G 1516 (Kd, 310 – 4300  nM). Unexpectedly, addition of the aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin (but not hygromycin B) caused a dose-dependent increase of up to 7. 5 -fold in the binding of the highest affinity 10 -mer 1493 to 30  S subunits. Oligonucleotides containing residues complementary to A 1492 and/or A 1493 showed particularly marked stimulation of binding by paromomycin. The results are consistent with high-resolution structures of antibiotic binding to the A site and with greater accessibility of residues of A 1492 and A 1493 upon paromomycin binding. 10 -mer 1493 binding is thus a probe of the conformational switch to the ‘closed’ conformation triggered by paromomycin that is implicated in the discrimination by 30  S subunits of cognate from non-cognate tRNA and the translational misreading caused by paromomycin. Finally, we show that OMe oligonucleotides targeted to the A site are moderately good inhibitors of in vitro translation {{and that there is a}} limited correlation of inhibition activity with binding strength to the A site...|$|E
40|$|Expression of the {{plasmid gene}} cat- 86 is induced in Bacillus subtilis by two antibiotics, {{chloramphenicol}} and the nucleoside antibiotic amicetin. We proposed that induction by either drug causes the destabilization of a stem-loop structure in cat- 86 mRNA that sequesters the ribosome-binding {{site for the}} cat coding sequence. The destabilization event frees the ribosome-binding site, permitting the initiation of translation of cat- 86 mRNA. cat- 86 induction {{is due to the}} stalling of a ribosome in a leader region of cat- 86 mRNA, which is located 5 ' to the RNA stem-loop structure. A stalled ribosome that is active in cat- 86 induction has its <b>aminoacyl</b> <b>site</b> occupied by leader codon 6. To test the hypothesis that a leader site 5 ' to codon 6 permits a ribosome to stall in the presence of an inducing antibiotic, we inserted an extra codon between leader codons 5 and 6. This insertion blocked induction, which was then restored by the deletion of leader codon 6. Thus, induction seems to require the maintenance of a precise spatial relationship between an upstream leader site(s) and leader codon 6. Mutations in the ribosome-binding site for the cat- 86 leader, RBS- 2, which decreased its strength of binding to 16 S rRNA, prevented induction. In contrast, mutations that significantly altered the sequence of RBS- 2 but increased its strength of binding to 16 S rRNA did not block induction by either chloramphenicol or amicetin. We therefore suspected that the proposed leader site that permitted drug-mediated stalling was located between RBS- 2 and leader codon 6. This region of the cat- 86 leader contains an eight-nucleotide sequence (conserved region I) that is largely conserved among all known cat leaders. The codon immediately 5 ' to conserved region I differs, however, between amicetin-inducible and amicetin-noninducible cat genes. In amicetin-inducible cat genes such as cat- 86, the codon 5 ' to conserved region I is a valine codon, GTG. The same codon in amicetin-noninducible cat genes is a lysine codon, either AAA or AAG. When the GTG codon immediately 5 ' to conserved region I in cat- 86 was changed to AAA, amicetin was no longer active in cat- 86 induction, but chloramphenicol induction was unaffected by the mutation. The potential role of the GTG codon in amicetin induction is discussed...|$|E
