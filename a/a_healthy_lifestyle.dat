40|$|Designers have {{increasingly}} used {{the capacity of}} design to influence human behavior and consequently to address the challenges that our society faces.

Moreover, {{it could lead to}} a higher level of wellbeing for many people. In response to this challenge, designers and computer scientists have created interventions that help people adopt <b>a</b> <b>healthier</b> <b>lifestyle.</b> We argue that designers need to consider the different stages that people go through to durably change their behavior.

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF MICHELLE OSTIEN, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} FOOD AND NUTRITION, {{presented}} on November 20, 2008, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN FEMALES WITH REGARDS TO PERFECTIONISM IN THOSE WITH ANOREXIA NERVOSA, HIGH BMI (BINGE EATERS VS. NON-BINGE EATERS), AND THOSE SEEKING A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Sharon Peterson One in five {{women in the}} United States struggle with an eating disorder or distorted eating patterns (National Institute of Mental Health, 2001). Perfectionism, one of the risk factors for developing an eating disorder, is a trait {{that many of these}} women have in common. While much research has been done on perfectionism in women with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, few studies have looked at perfectionism in women with binge eating disorder (Pratt, Telch, Labouvie, Wilson, 2 ̆ 6 Agras, 2001). Our study sought to further understand the similarities and differences of the total and individual components of perfectionism in females seeking <b>a</b> <b>healthier</b> <b>lifestyle,</b> high BMI binge eaters, high BMI non-binge eaters, and anorexics. Our study found that the first component of the perfectionism scale (representing self-oriented perfectionism) was found to be significant between groups (p= 0. 002). When comparing females seeking <b>a</b> <b>healthier</b> <b>lifestyle</b> to high BMI binge eaters, females seeking <b>a</b> <b>healthier</b> <b>lifestyle</b> were more likely to answer 2 ̆ 2 no 2 ̆ 2, while high BMI binge eaters were more likely to answer 2 ̆ 2 yes 2 ̆ 2 (p= 0. 006). When comparing females seeking <b>a</b> <b>healthier</b> <b>lifestyle</b> to anorexics, females seeking <b>a</b> <b>healthier</b> <b>lifestyle</b> were more likely to answer 2 ̆ 2 no 2 ̆ 2 when compared to anorexics (p= 0. 033). When comparing high BMI binge eaters to high BMI non-binge eaters, high BMI binge eaters {{were also more likely to}} answer 2 ̆ 2 yes 2 ̆ 2 to this question when compared to high BMI non-binge eaters (p= 0. 048).

25|$|The Scottish Health Education Group was {{the first}} {{organisation}} to sponsor the Scottish Cup in 1983 with the largest sponsorship package in Scottish football at the time, worth around £200,000. The partnership was praised {{for the promotion of}} <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>lifestyle</b> linked with football. The deal ended in 1989 when Tennent Caledonian Breweries won the sponsorship rights. Tennent's association with the tournament raised the debate about alcohol sponsorship within sports following the riots at the 1980 Scottish Cup Final which resulted in the sale of alcohol being banned at Scottish sporting events. Despite this controversy, the partnership was largely successful and lasted 18 years until 2007. The SFA received around £25 million over the duration of the sponsorship deal. The Scottish Government in association with businessman Willie Haughey sponsored the Scottish Cup between 2008 and 2010. The 2008–09 competition was known as the Homecoming Scottish Cup to promote Scotland's year of homecoming and tourism. The 2009–10 competition was known the Active Nation Scottish Cup to promote a healthy living through football. Carling was an additional sponsor between 2010 and 2014 as the competition's official beer. The current title sponsor is bookmaker William Hill.|$|E

500|$|Once discovered, {{vitamins}} {{were actively}} promoted in articles and advertisements in McCall's, Good Housekeeping, {{and other media}} outlets. Marketers enthusiastically promoted cod-liver oil, a source of Vitamin D, as [...] "bottled sunshine", and bananas as a “natural vitality food". They promoted foods such as yeast cakes, a source of B vitamins, {{on the basis of}} scientifically-determined nutritional value, rather than taste or appearance. [...] World War II researchers focused on the need to ensure adequate nutrition, especially in processed foods. Robert W. Yoder is credited with first using the term vitamania, in 1942, to describe the appeal of relying on nutritional supplements rather than on obtaining vitamins from a varied diet of foods.

At Arsenal, Wenger brought in dieticians to explain the benefits of <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>lifestyle,</b> and acquired the help of Philippe Boixel, an osteopath for the France national team, to realign the players' bodies each month. Plyometrics, exercises designed to strengthen the muscles, were introduced and Wenger routinely made players stretch before and after matches. Until 2004, he encouraged his players to take Creatine for increased stamina, later stopping when he noticed side-effects. The innovations had a desirable effect on the team as it prolonged the careers of his defence, and made Arsenal stronger {{in the second half of}} seasons. Though Wenger's methods were common in Italian football, they had been unsuccessfully trialled in England until his arrival.|$|E
