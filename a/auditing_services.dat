40|$|The {{current study}} investigates {{the current status}} of {{external}} <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> in Jordan. In particular, the study comes to evaluate the audit quality attributes and the client satisfaction with <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> in various sectors in Jordan. In addition, the study outlines the possible procedures necessary to enhance the quality of <b>audit</b> <b>services.</b> Furthermore, the study tests the relationship between audit quality attributes and client satisfaction. Based on 48 useable questionnaires, clients see that audit firms have the necessary technical competence, experience and expertise to conduct of audit field work effectively. Thus, findings indicate that clients are satisfied with <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> in Jordan to a considerable extent. A significant, positive relationship has been found between “field work conduct and technical competence ” factor and client satisfaction. No significant relationship has been found between the other two factors (i. e. experience and responsiveness and independence and executive involvement) and client satisfaction with <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> in Jordan. A consensus in the perception of clients from different sectors toward the evaluation of audit quality attributes and satisfaction with <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> has been found. The results indicate that more emphasis should be given to some audit quality attributes (i. e. responsiveness, independence and executive involvement) to enhance the overall satisfaction of clients with <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> in Jordan. In addition, the study findings revealed that providing better training for auditors and compliance with corporate governance code for auditing are important procedures to improve audit quality in Jordan...|$|R

Profiting from the typical interactive verification system, we projected an interactive audit procedure to implement the <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> based on a third party auditor. In this audit examination, the third party auditor can concern a periodic authentication to check the change of outsourced data by providing an optimized to-do list. To understand the audit model, we only need to preserve the security of the third party auditor and organize an insubstantial daemon to execute the verification protocol. We present an capable method for selecting an optimal parameter value to minimize computational expenditure of cloud <b>audit</b> <b>services.</b> Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach...|$|R
