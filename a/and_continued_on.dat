5|$|Despite his partial {{recovery}} evident in America, Weber {{felt that he}} was unable to resume regular teaching at that time <b>and</b> <b>continued</b> <b>on</b> as a private scholar, helped by an inheritance in 1907. In 1909, disappointed with the Verein, he co-founded the German Sociological Association (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie, or DGS) and served as its first treasurer. He would, however, resign from the DGS in 1912. In 1912, Weber tried to organise a left-wing political party to combine social-democrats and liberals. This attempt was unsuccessful, in part because many liberals feared social-democratic revolutionary ideals.|$|E

The route remained on Elmwood Avenue into Brighton, where it turned north onto South Winton Road at Twelve Corners. At Highland Avenue, NY47 reentered Rochester and became North Winton Road at East Avenue (NY96).

5|$|On March 7, Prince William of Wied {{arrived in}} Albania, and intense {{fighting}} occurred north of Gjirokastër, {{in the region}} of Cepo, in an attempt to take control over Northern Epirus; Albanian gendarmerie units tried unsuccessfully to infiltrate southwardly, facing resistance from the Epirotes. On March 11, a provisional settlement was brokered in Corfu by Dutch Colonel Thomson. Albania was prepared to accept a limited Northern Epirote government, but Karapanos insisted on complete autonomy, a condition rejected by the Albanian delegates, and negotiations reached a deadlock.

5|$|Still in Oriente, Castro was furious. Recognizing the {{establishment}} of a military junta, he ended the ceasefire <b>and</b> <b>continued</b> <b>on</b> the offensive. The MR-26-7 put together a plan to oust the Cantillo-Piedra junta, freeing the high-ranking military officer Colonel Ramón Barquín from the Isle of Pines prison (where he had been held captive for plotting to overthrow Batista), and commanding him to fly to Havana to arrest Cantillo. Accompanying widespread celebrations as news of Batista's downfall spread across Cuba on 1 January 1959, Castro ordered the MR-26-7 to take responsibility for policing the country, in order to prevent widespread looting and vandalism.|$|E
5|$|Superb and Temeraire {{returned}} home {{the following month}} after supporting Allied operations in the Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea and were placed into reserve. Later that year, Temeraire was converted into a cadet training ship <b>and</b> <b>continued</b> <b>on</b> that duty until early 1921 when she was paid off. In the meantime Superb relieved Bellerophon as a gunnery training ship in late 1919 and the latter was reduced to reserve. Superb was relieved in her turn {{at the end of}} 1919 and was paid off in early 1920. The ship was used for gunnery trials beginning {{at the end of the}} year and was used as a target ship during 1922 before being sold, the last of the sisters still in existence as Temeraire and Bellerophon had been sold for scrap in late 1921.|$|E

5|$|The {{above-mentioned}} migration {{was undertaken}} by {{a part of}} the Jastorf population, which probably included the tribes later called Bastarnae and Scirii in Greek written sources, noted because of their military exploits around Greece and Greek colonies in the later part of the 3rd century BC. Their route went along the Warta and Noteć rivers, then crossed Kujawy and Masovia, turned south along the Bug River <b>and</b> <b>continued</b> <b>on</b> to what today is Moldavia, where they settled and developed the Poienesti-Lukasevka culture. The route is marked by archeological findings, especially the characteristic bronze crown-shaped necklaces.|$|E

5|$|The three ships {{served in}} a variety of roles and {{locations}} throughout their career. Illinois served with the North Atlantic Squadron and the European Squadron early in her career, while Wisconsin served as the flagship of the Pacific Fleet and then in the Asiatic Fleet. Illinois and Alabama started the cruise of the Great White Fleet in December 1907 from the east coast of the United States, though by the time they had rounded South America and stopped in California, Alabama was forced to leave the fleet due to machinery problems. Wisconsin joined the fleet there <b>and</b> <b>continued</b> <b>on</b> with it to the conclusion of its tour in February 1909. All three ships were modernized in 1909 and served in the Atlantic Fleet for a short time.|$|E

After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was deployed as a coastal defense ship in the Baltic, where she saw heavy service against the Russians. She supported the German drive on Libau in AprilMay 1915, and was damaged by mines during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga. She was repeatedly attacked by Allied submarines, though she was never hit. In 1917, Thetis was withdrawn from front-line service {{for use as a}} gunnery training ship. She survived the war <b>and</b> <b>continued</b> <b>on</b> in service with the Reichsmarine through the 1920s. She was stricken from the naval register on 29 March 1929 and broken up for scrap the following year.|$|E
5|$|Titan was {{examined}} by both Voyager 1 and 2 in 1980 and 1981, respectively. Voyager 1s trajectory {{was designed to}} provide an optimized Titan flyby, during which the spacecraft was able to determine the density, composition, and temperature of the atmosphere, and obtain a precise measurement of Titan's mass. Atmospheric haze prevented direct imaging of the surface, though in 2004 intensive digital processing of images taken through Voyager 1s orange filter did reveal hints of the light and dark features now known as Xanadu and Shangri-la, which had been observed in the infrared by the Hubble Space Telescope. Voyager 2, {{which would have been}} diverted to perform the Titan flyby if Voyager 1 had been unable to, did not pass near Titan <b>and</b> <b>continued</b> <b>on</b> to Uranus and Neptune.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid left Kent for Rome in {{the company}} of Benedict Biscop, another of Eanflæd's contacts. This is the first pilgrimage to Rome known to have been {{undertaken}} by English natives, and took place some time between 653 and 658. According to Wilfrid's later biographer, Stephen of Ripon, Wilfrid left Biscop's company at Lyon, where Wilfrid stayed under the patronage of Annemund, the archbishop. Stephen says that Annemund wanted to marry Wilfrid to the archbishop's niece, and to make Wilfrid the governor of a Frankish province, but that Wilfrid refused <b>and</b> <b>continued</b> <b>on</b> his journey to Rome. There he learned the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter, and studied the Roman practice of relic collecting. After an audience with the pope, Wilfrid returned to Lyon.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved through}} the West Indies between November3 and November4. The wave reached the vicinity of Turks and Caicos Islands on November 5, where it developed into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC. The storm moved north-northwestward and then westward across the southern Bahamas. A ridge aloft blocked the storm's westward progress and caused it to re-curve west-southwestward on November 6. The system strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane at 1200 UTC on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Around 1800 UTC on November 6, the storm made landfall on Cayo Romano in Camagüey Province with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). The system quickly weakened while crossing the mountainous terrain of Cuba and fell to tropical storm intensity early on November 7, shortly before emerging into the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Later that day, the storm re-intensified into a Category 1 hurricane <b>and</b> <b>continued</b> <b>on</b> a southwestward path.|$|E
5|$|After a {{farewell}} {{visit from the}} Eastern Fleet commander, Admiral Sir James Somerville on 12 January 1943, Illustrious sailed for home the next day. She flew off her aircraft to Gibraltar on 31 January <b>and</b> <b>continued</b> <b>on</b> to the Clyde where she arrived five days later. She conducted deck-landing trials for prototypes of the Blackburn Firebrand and Fairey Firefly fighters, {{as well as the}} Fairey Barracuda dive/torpedo bomber from 8 to 10 February. On 26 February she began a refit at Birkenhead that lasted until 7 June during which her flight deck was extended, new radars were installed, her light antiaircraft armament was augmented, and two new arrestor wires were fitted aft of the rear lift which increased her effective landing area. While conducting her postrefit trials, she also conducted flying trials for Martlet Vs and Barracudas. Both sets of trials were completed by 18 July, by which time the Illustrious had joined the Home Fleet.|$|E
