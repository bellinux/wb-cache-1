In deference to these concerns (including those voiced by the British Army) Land Rover kept the 300Tdi in production for fitment to special-order vehicles (see above). It transpired that the Td5's electronics were highly reliable. Early engines suffered two isolated mechanical failures—sudden and complete failure of the oil pump drive and 'cylinder head shuffle' caused by weak retaining studs. Both these faults were fixed within 2 years of the engine starting production and the Td5 is now considered highly reliable. In 2002 the engine was improved to reach Euro 3 <b>antipollution</b> stage, and an EGR valve system was introduced.

In contrast, one of {{the government}}'s most prominent actions, the No Driving Day program, may have inadvertently contributed to higher pollution levels. Under the program, metropolitan area residents were prohibited from driving their vehicles one day each work week based on the last number of their license plate. However, those with the resources to do so purchased additional automobiles to use on the day their principal vehicle was prohibited from driving, thus adding to the region's vehicle stock. Thermal inversions reached such dangerous levels at various times in the mid-1990s that the government declared pollution emergencies, necessitating sharp temporary cutbacks in vehicle use and industrial production.|$|E

50|$|Julius C. Michaelson, 89, of Angell St., Providence, died {{at home on}} Saturday, November 12, 2011. Born in Salem, MA {{he was the son}} of {{the late}} Carl and Celia (Cooley) Michaelson. A Providence {{resident}} for most of his life, Mr. Michaelson was educated in Providence Public Schools graduating from Hope High School in 1939 and subsequently graduating from Boston University School of Law in 1947. He later received his master's degree in Philosophy from Brown University. He served as a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army during World War II. A Past President of the Rhode Island Bar Association, he began his law career with his partner and lifelong friend, Milton Stanzler, as a principle partner in the law firm of Abedon, Michaelson and Stanzler retiring in 2010 from Michaelson & Michaelson, where he was a partner with his son Jeffrey. Among his many accomplishments and recognitions, he was general counsel to the State AFL-CIO, served as a Senator in the Rhode Island General Assembly for a dozen years and was the Attorney General in the 1970s. He concentrated much of his political and legal efforts championing causes of social justice to aid the ordinary citizen and society's less fortunate. Mr. Michaelson received many awards over his long career. In 2002, he was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame. Part of its citation reads as follows: “Your real accomplishments rise above office holding. You have been a community stalwart your entire life and seamlessly joined the causes of social justice into your legislative life. You spoke out against racial injustice and chaired an Ad Hoc group to study the problem, and eventually led the charge in the General Assembly that passed a Fair Housing Law, and paved the way for open public meetings. At the same time, you gave your vocal stamp of approval to women's rights legislation like the Equal Rights Amendment in your capacity as chairperson of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In 1971, it was pointed out that you concentrated much of your efforts on bills to help the ordinary citizen, such as the Fair Housing Law, consumer protection, <b>antipollution,</b> conservation and for school teachers rights to collective bargaining, (the bill named the Michaelson Act), and that your work in these areas attracted much attention beyond the borders of Providence. It has been said that whatever the issue, you seemed to instinctively side with society's less fortunate, not always a popular or pragmatic position to take. You followed the star of social justice regardless of the consequences. In a larger frame, you served on the National Institute for Democracy under Madeline Albright to promote democracy in third world countries, were a delegate to the 1980 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Madrid, and in 1988, you participated in American-Russian bilateral talks in Moscow. In a break with partisanship, President Reagan appointed you to the Foreign Service Grievance Board. Throughout your distinguished career, you rose above party politics to do what you thought was the right thing. You truly represent the State's Independent Spirit.” Mr. Michaelson is survived by Rita, his wife of sixty-one years, sons, Mark and Jeffrey, daughter-in-law Karen, grandchildren Kristen and Graham, brothers-in-law Dr. Joel Caslowitz and Dr. Ronald Green and sisters-in-law Susan Green and Joyce Richard. Funeral arrangements under the direction of the Holt Funeral Home, 510 So. Main St., Woonsocket, will be held Tuesday, November 15, 2011 at 2 PM in Temple Beth El, 70 Orchard Ave., Providence. Burial will follow in Swan Point Cemetery, Blackstone Blvd., Providence.

The topical exposure to pollution activates cutaneous stress. Objective: In this study, we tested the <b>antipollution</b> protection of two active components: Dead Sea minerals (Dead Sea mineral-rich water [DSW]) and anionic polysaccharide (PolluStop® [PS]). Materials and methods: Two representative pollution models were studied using reconstructed epidermis: 1) mixture of pollutants (MOP) containing heavy metals and atmospheric particulate matter and 2) ozone exposure. DSW and PS were topically applied alone or in combination, and their protection against pollution was assessed by testing the levels of the inflammation markers interleukin 1 α (IL- 1 α) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). Results: MOP exposure induced IL- 1 α release, which was attenuated following pre-application with DSW and PS alone or in combination. Ozone exposure induced IL- 1 α and PGE 2 release. Pre-application with DSW or PS alone did not inhibit IL- 1 α and PGE 2 overproduction. Only when DSW and PS were mixed together, inhibition of these inflammatory markers was observed. Conclusion: The observations reveal the potential use of active agents in combination for a selective mode of protection from urban pollution. This is because many active materials cannot solely provide a broad protection against different types of pollutants. This strategy might be beneficial for future <b>antipollution</b> regimen formulated in both pharmaceutical and cosmetic products.

This was achieved by adjustment of the lanthanum-doped sol–gel parameters such as molar ratio of precursors in lanthanum-doped TiO 2 -sols, the ratio of titanium tetrabutoxide to polyvinyl alcohol, dip-coating velocity, drying duration in air, thermal treatment and number of cyclical time of the process. Titania nano crystals were prepared at ambient temperature in a liquid media using titanium tetrabutoxide as precursor, and the crystallization of amorphous precursor was preceded by peptizing with acid and then refluxing for a periodic time in homothermal water-bath.
