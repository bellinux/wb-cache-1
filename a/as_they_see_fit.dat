25|$|Academic tenure's {{original}} {{purpose was to}} guarantee the right to academic freedom: it protects teachers and researchers when they dissent from prevailing opinion, openly disagree with authorities of any sort, or spend time on unfashionable topics.

Without job security, the scholarly community as a whole may experience pressure to favor noncontroversial lines of academic inquiry. The intent of tenure is to allow original ideas to be more likely to arise, by giving scholars the intellectual autonomy to investigate the problems and solutions <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>fit</b> and to report their honest conclusions.

We then considered using archival astronomical images to perform data reduction and image processing. However, the comments in the students’ evaluations repeatedly emphasized that the image acquisition session was {{the best part of}} the course. The hands-on experience of obtaining celestial images as the result of an active decision making process created a very positive impact on the students. Additionally, image acquisition allows them to keep the usage rights of the images and use them <b>as</b> <b>they</b> best <b>see</b> <b>fit.</b> Therefore, locations with perpetual bad weather conditions for astronomy would probably benefit from photographing the moon and the sun instead.

40|$|This {{research}} project endeavours a broader {{understanding of the}} lived life in a small alternative rural-style community within the city. The {{goal is to create}} a more nuanced and insightful view on the consequences of the liquid modernity, as it applies on local communities in the city landscape of Copenhagen. From a clear phenomenological and hermeneutical point of view and with our empirical material created through extensive fieldwork, we seek answers and understanding through a number of qualitative research methods at a particular alternative residential place; Ballonparken, a closed military installation inside Copenhagen. The project also builds on a theoretical framework based on critiques of the city in the liquid society, from Henri Lefebvre, Zygmunt Bauman, David Harvey and the planning rationales of John Friedmann. Through observation and qualitative interviews with the residents, we conclude through our analysis, how the development of planning and maintaining the areas around and physical structures within Ballonparken correlates with the social mindsets of its inhabitants of Ballonparken. The inhabitants of Ballonparken has created and continually recreates a piece of alternative society, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> best <b>fit</b> to live in. Although Ballonparken as of today has reached status as an independent foundation, we see that there is an ongoing internal struggle between residents regarding the wish for more private life, as opposed to the existing structure of communal toilets and baths etc. If these patterns continues, we predict it can have harming consequences on the social ties in Ballonparken...|$|R
40|$|EU {{membership}} as {{a constitutional}} issue This article {{deals with the}} allez and retour provisions (Claes 2005 : 84 f) of the Swedish constitution in relation toEU membership.

I find that neither was changed in anymaterial way. Second, to try to explain the apparent reluctance of the parties involved to clarify the constitutionalimplications of EU membership. I find that this reluctance is rooted in a belief that European integration is notfurthered if the rules contained in the allez and retour provisions are made stricter and more precise. Third, toconfront a question conspicuously omitted by the parties in their revision: namely, by what criterion should theallez and retour provisions be intertwined, if an optimum of bi-level constitutionalism is to be achieved?I argue that, in the end, the underlying issue is whether Swedish citizens want to see the principle of freemovement applied as widely <b>as</b> possible.

For the invited artists, the Library Intervention brief is to explore the Library <b>as</b> best <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>fit</b> and create a new body of work that responds to some aspect of the collection and/or library environment. Classifications and definitions are sometimes opportunistic, necessary and yet fleeting. Collections grow and shift, differing formats make access mutable. Choose an archaic format and content becomes fleeting, a historic shadow. Yet when new knowledge is encountered, so is our own sense of being encountered: We are moved. Sometimes the challenge of these encounters make for doubt, the encounter is not always welcomed; but Library Interventions seek the welcome encounter of moving knowledge and knowledge moving. We are particularly looking for filmmakers or artists working with moving image to explore this theme. All the artists and the resulting artwork, via Library Interventions, will be interacting with staff, students, and the public, modifying or focusing some aspect of the library collection. We hope these creative disruptions, situated in the heart of this learning environment, are able to awaken curiosity as to the possible uses of the Library as a vital component in the creative process.

50|$|This {{change was}} not well-received with Icelanders, as it in reality {{translated}} to reduced autonomy for Iceland. Before 1849, Icelanders had officially ruled themselves <b>as</b> <b>they</b> happened to <b>see</b> <b>fit</b> in domestic matters.

The Danes were reluctant {{to meet the demands of}} Icelanders for self-government as set forth during the National Assembly of 1851, in the belief that it would weaken Denmark's control in Schleswig and Holstein. But when said region was annexed by Prussia in 1867, new conditions were created and stöðulögin ("the laws of standing") were passed 1871, which determined the standing of Iceland in relation to the Danish state. In 1874, on the millennial anniversary of the settlement in Iceland, Christian IX became king of Denmark and attended the festivities of the watershed occasion. This opportunity was used to give Iceland its own separate constitution. This constitution was called Stjórnarskrá um hin sérstaklegu málefni Íslands, and was the basis of Iceland's current constitution.|$|R
40|$|Introduction In recent years, {{opportunities}} for postgraduate university education in implant dentistry have increased significantly, {{with an increase}} in both the number but also the complexity of available postgraduate programmes. However, {{there appears to be a}} lack of standards directing the learning outcomes of such programmes. Methods A scientific literature search was conducted for publications reporting on university programmes within implant dentistry, including description of programmes and evaluation of learning outcomes. A separate Internet search was conducted to collect information on existing university programmes as presented on university websites. Results Implant dentistry has reached a critical mass of an independent, multidisciplinary and vibrant domain of science, which combines knowledge and discovery from many clinical and basic sciences. Many university programmes conclude with a master's or equivalent degree, but there appears to be a great diversity with regard to duration and learning objectives, as well as targeted skills and competences. The importance of implant dentistry has also increased within established specialist training programmes. There was little indication, however, that the comprehensive aspects of implant dentistry are present in all specialist training programmes where implants are being covered. Conclusions Although universities should maintain the options of designing academic programmes <b>as</b> <b>they</b> best <b>see</b> <b>fit,</b> it is imperative for them to introduce some form of transparent and comparable criteria, which will allow the profession and the public to relate the degree and academic credentials to the actual skills and competences of the degree holder. With regard to established specialist training programmes, the interdisciplinary and comprehensive nature of implant dentistry needs to be emphasised, covering both surgical and restorative aspects. Finally, implant dentistry is not, at present, a dental specialty. The profession has not reached a consensus as to whether the introduction of a new recognised specialist field is either necessary or desired...|$|R

That particular part of those measures from which the virtual repeal of the Missouri Compromise is sought to be inferred (for it is admitted they contain nothing about it in express terms) is the provision in the Utah and New Mexico laws which permits them when they seek admission into the Union as States to come in with or without slavery, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> shall then <b>see</b> <b>fit.</b> Now I insist this provision was made for Utah and New Mexico, and for no other place whatever.
