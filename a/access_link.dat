50|$|An Integrated Access Device (or IAD) is a {{customer}} premises device that {{provides access to}} wide area networks and the Internet.

The <b>access</b> <b>link</b> may be a T1 line, a DSL connection, a cable (CATV) network, a broadband wireless link, or a metro-Ethernet connection.|$|E

30|$|When the VPL is at 30 dB (Figures 21 and 22), {{compared}} with the baseline case, when the MNs are introduced to the system, {{there is still a}} slight degradation in micro UE throughput but not as obvious as when the VPL is at 15 dB. There are two reasons for this. First, the interference power from micro BSs to the <b>access</b> <b>links</b> of MNs can be significantly attenuated by the vehicles. Therefore, fewer ABSs are required for the micro BSs to protect the <b>access</b> <b>links</b> of MNs. Second, at high VPL, the interference from the <b>access</b> <b>links</b> of MNs to nearby micro UEs (see Figure 2) can also be attenuated by the vehicles.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In the {{on-going}} {{debate on}} how large Internet router buffers should be, {{of particular interest}} is a recent claim that 10 - 50 packets of buffering suffice, permitting all-optical buffering in the Internet core. It is argued that TCP traffic, when well-paced (typically by slow <b>access</b> <b>links),</b> can achieve acceptable link utilisation with very small buffers. In this paper we investigate if this result holds {{in the presence of}} highperformance scientific applications connecting over high-speed <b>access</b> <b>links.</b> Our results show that the presence of a significant proportion of high-speed <b>access</b> <b>links</b> necessitates larger buffers at the core link. However, we show that end-host TCP pacing by such applications can alleviate the problem effectively. I...|$|R

50|$|An IAD is {{sometimes}} installed by the service provider {{to which a}} customer wishes to connect. This allows the service provider to control {{the features of the}} <b>access</b> <b>link</b> and manage its operation during use. Competitive service providers are now offering access services over a variety of access technologies, including wireless optical (i.e., Terabeam) and metro-Ethernet networks. Old telco protocols and transport methods (T1 lines and time-division multiplexing) are replaced with access methods that are appropriate for the underlying transport. Because of this, the provider will usually specify an appropriate IAD or install an IAD.|$|E
50|$|VoIP {{endpoints}} {{usually have}} to wait for completion of transmission of previous packets before new data may be sent. Although it is possible to preempt (abort) a less important packet in mid-transmission, this is not commonly done, especially on high-speed links where transmission times are short even for maximum-sized packets. An alternative to preemption on slower links, such as dialup and digital subscriber line (DSL), is to reduce the maximum transmission time by reducing the maximum transmission unit. But every packet must contain protocol headers, so this increases relative header overhead on every link traversed, not just the bottleneck (usually Internet <b>access)</b> <b>link.</b>|$|E

Except for the expressway at the northern end—the remnant of a much more ambitious plan to make the entire roadway one—US 209 remains a two-lane rural road for much of its length in the state.

It highly advertised this system to customers, which allowed a customer to go any Revco to have their prescription refilled without the stores having to call each other on the phone.

5000|$|Programming {{languages}} {{that support}} nested subroutines {{also have a}} field in the call frame that points to the stack frame of the latest activation of the procedure that most closely encapsulates the callee, i.e. the immediate scope of the callee. This is called an <b>access</b> <b>link</b> or static link (as it keeps track of static nesting during dynamic and recursive calls) and provides the routine (as well as any other routines it may invoke) access to the local data of its encapsulating routines at every nesting level. Some architectures, compilers, or optimization cases store one link for each enclosing level (not just the immediately enclosing), so that deeply nested routines that access shallow data {{do not have to}} traverse several links; this strategy is often called a [...] "display".|$|E
