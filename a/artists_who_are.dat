[...] However, Billboard argued that, assuming the ratio of people who paid for the full album was comparable to subscription numbers of Spotify and Pandora Radio, earnings between $1 and 6 million were more likely: [...] "not bad showing for a self-released, direct-to-fan album that allowed Yorke to circumvent major download stores and gather customer information — but it's no Hollywood starring role, either." ...|$|E

500|$|While many {{cartoons}} {{are based}} on script pitches to network executives, Cartoon Network allowed Adventure Time to [...] "build their own teams organically" [...] and communication {{through the use of}} storyboards and animatics. Cartoon Network chief content officer Rob Sorcher explained that the network allowed this because the company was [...] "dealing with <b>artists</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> primarily visual people" [...] and by using storyboards, the writers and artists could learn and grow [...] "by actually doing the work." [...] As such, Ward soon assembled a storyboarding team for the series, which was largely composed of [...] "younger, inexperienced people" [...] who had been found using the Internet. However, Cartoon Network, worrying about the status of the show and the inexperience of its production members, hired three veteran animators who had worked on SpongeBob SquarePants to help guide Ward and his team: Derek Drymon (who served as executive producer for the first season of Adventure Time), Merriwether Williams (who served as head story editors for the show's first and second seasons), and Nick Jennings (who became the series' long-serving art director). Thurop Van Orman, the creator of The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack, was also hired on as a supervising producer, providing guidance for the series' first two seasons.|$|E
