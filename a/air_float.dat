5000|$|Frontier School Division is {{the largest}} {{geographical}} school division in Manitoba, Canada, covering most schools in northern Manitoba. With 41 schools operating across Manitoba, the Frontier School Division provides educational services to a larger geographical area than any other school division in Canada. A unique organization, the Frontier School Division operates schools in small Manitoba communities that are often only accessible by boat, <b>air</b> (<b>float</b> plane), rail, or winter ice road.|$|E
40|$|During the {{dressing}} of minerals, different machines such as screening machine, electromagnetic separator, <b>air</b> <b>float</b> machine, uploading and offloading of crushed materials, {{crushing and grinding}} machines etc are employed. Most processes are dry hence dust is always generated, this occupies the working environment and it is inhaled by workers while some are carried away by wind to the atmosphere which may eventually be deposited on water in streams and ponds. The dust, whether inhaled dry or in solution by man or aquatic animals some negative resultant effects emerged {{after a period of}} time. With this as envisaged, a sample of dust was collected from a tin processing company in Jos, and 20 g of it was analyzed in the National Metallurgical Development Center (NMDC) laboratory, Jos, using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) where the chemical analysis revealed that the dust contains 12 % Al 2 O 3, 43. 8 % SiO 2, 11. 85 % Fe 2 O 3, Ag 2 O 0. 57 %, PbO 0. 45 %, ZnO 0. 27 %, Nb 2 O 5 2. 18 % etc which most especially SiO 2 is capable of causing silicosis, PbO causing high blood pressure, kidney damage, miscarriages and abortions, disruptions of nervous system, brain damage, decline fertility, retardation of learning ability in children etc., while ZnO causing flu-like illness also known as metal fume fever and the rest tuberculosis, cancer of the lungs, asthma and other respiratory diseases after exposed to them for a short / long period of time. This paper suggests three important ways of preventing such occurrences, viz: engineering control, administrative control and wearing of personal protective equipment when working in such an environment...|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a kind of}} small satellite disturbing loads full-physical simulation system {{which is used to}} deeply research and validate the control algorithms of orbit and attitude of small satellite under the effect of spacial disturbances. The system uses methods of <b>air</b> <b>floating</b> and hanging for gravity compensation of the five DOF <b>air</b> <b>floating</b> platform on which flexible solar wings have been installed. The main parts of the system have been designed and analyzed in the text. Finally, the feasibility of the system has been illustrated by the simulation that result from the combination of ANSYS and ADAMS softwares. The system proposed in this paper make it available that the satellite with flexible attachment as a whole be used for experiments under spacial disturbances on the ground, it is of great significance to suppress the vibration of flexible attachment and strengthen the stability of the position of satellite under spacial disturbances...|$|R

Some of these weapons require advanced levels in the tech tree.|$|R

[...] When the long swaths of cut hemp lies across the field, the smell is represented as strongest, [...] "impregnating the clothing of the men, spreading far throughout the air." [...] To many this odor is essentially unpleasant.|$|R
