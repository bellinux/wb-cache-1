40|$|The Chaco-Pampean plain {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} plains worldwide; present a wetland macro system (lagoons, marshes, rivers, streams, channels). The water quality of these environments is diverse and has different trace elements natural (As, F, Mo and V) and anthropogenic (Cr, Cu and Pb). The Chaco Pampean plain has an important diversity of fish species however the species of commercial importance are limited. This paper presents the reviews of the studies related to the presence of trace elements in tissues of commercial fishes (shad Prochilodus lineatus and silversides Odontesthes bonariensis) in the Chaco-Pampean plain in recent decades and a discussion about associated information gaps is presented. The presence of trace elements in commercial fish muscle is a major problem for food security. The results showed that most of the elements present in shad are in lower levels than the maximum limits set by the <b>Argentine</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Code</b> (CAA, 2014). In the case of Pb present in the muscle of the shad, the determined values exceed those considered by the European Food Safety Authority. In the case of silversides the values of As, Pb, Hg are mostly lower than those maximum recommended by the <b>Argentine</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Code.</b> However, according to the European Food Safety Authority, the lower limit on the benchmark dose for a 10...|$|E
40|$|This work {{studied the}} {{geographical}} distribution of fluoride {{content in the}} public water supply {{in the province of}} Tucumán, Argentina. A total of 1, 210 samples were collected in 190 localities of the 17 departments of the province during the 2008 - 2012 period. The analytical determination was performed using the SPADNS method and QGis 2. 16 was used for processing the information. The fluoride content requirements in the studied localities were determined according to the <b>Argentine</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Code.</b> The results showed that 94 % of population studied consumed water with fluoride concentrations below the recommended limits, 5 % were exposed to fluoride concentrations above the required maximum limit and 1 % consumed water at optimal fluoride concentrations. The maps showed a heterogeneous geographical distribution of fluorides, in which areas with deficit, excess and recommended values of fluorides can be differentiated; in some departments an inverse relationship between the density of the hydrological network and fluoride concentration can be observed. In the capital of the province, the average value found was 0. 32 mg/l, presenting a homogeneous geographical distribution. The information obtained is indispensable for the proper management of fluoride, so as to improve public health through policy...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the colour of dried sweet tomatoes, to prepare jams. The assay was carried out during 2013 at the Fruits and Vegetables Drying Laboratory from the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) Rama Caída Agricultural Experimental Station, Argentina. Franco variety tomatoes were used; these were peeled and cut, then 8 groups of 0, 5 kg each were formed in order to attain 4 treatments with two repetitions. The tomatoes were covered with sucrose (0, 5 kg) mixed with four doses of sodium metabisulfite (A: 0 %; B: 0, 2 %; C: 0, 5 %; D: 0, 8 %) and were left resting 24 hours. They were rinsed and dehydrated in an electric oven with forced ventilation at 55 °C until 0, 47 ± 0, 02 (humidity inferior to 20 %) of water activity was reached. Subsequently, the colour of the pulp of the dried tomatoes was measured every three months and the content of sulphur dioxide was determined after one year in storage. The four treatments evaluated presented stable colours in time; however, treatments C and D showed the highest values in colour space CIE L*, a*, b* (most intense and attractive red colours). Also, these treatments were the ones with the greatest residual amount of sulphur dioxide, however, they were below of the allowed limit established by the <b>Argentine</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Code</b> for the manufacturing of jams(C 160 ± 22, 63; D 1. 160 ± 214, 96 ppm) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{at making}} {{a diagnosis of}} the presence of arsenic, boron, fluorine and vanadium in the waters from the basin of El Divisorio stream, tributary of Paso de las Piedras reservoir, in the southwest of Buenos Aires Province. This storage is used to provide water to the cities of Bahía Blanca and Punta Alta with a population of approximately 400, 000 inhabitants. A selective and specific sampling of wells, perforations and superficial watercourses was made in 46 points, in an area of nearly 400 km 2. Groundwaters had arsenic (max. 0. 114 mg/l) exceeding the reference guideline in 97. 3 % of the samples, boron (max. 1. 42 mg/l), vanadium (max. 0. 8 mg/l) and fluorine (max. 6. 6 mg/l), being respect- tively, 91. 9 %, 82. 9 %, and 67. 6 %. Regarding the superficial flow, while arsenic concentrations were higher than the limit in 100 % of the cases (max. 0. 072 mg/l), 88. 9 % corresponded to elevated boron (max. 1 mg/l) and vanadium (max. 0. 23 mg/l) and only 22. 2 % to fluorine (max. 3. 18 mg/l) ones. In all these cases, concentrations exceed the reference guideline values suggested by the World Health Organization, the <b>Argentine</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Code</b> and the Environmental Protec- tion Agency. The presence of these contaminants that finally could determine the quality of the water resource entering the reservoir is attributed to the natural characteristics of the environment since contributions by anthropic actions have not been detected in the area. The most critical sectors in the basin were identified in order to stress the possible negative influence of consuming these waters on the community’s health, with the purpose of reporting the results to institutions, authorities and the population and applying them to preventive medicine...|$|E

Methods: A total of 3216 composite <b>food</b> <b>codes</b> from the NDNS food composition databank were subject to disaggregation.

Conclusions: By incorporating disaggregated data into NDNS, variations will be seen in consumption of some main food groups, but these variations may be also attributable to trends in consumption.

Within the ASA 24 software, respondents {{may choose to}} enter open-ended text to report “unfound food” and “other, specify. ” Respondents use the“unfound food” field to report a food or drink they cannot find; the ASA 24 system then asks a series of general questions to better identify the food. Respondents use the “other, specify” field to provide food details, such as brand name or cooking method, that differ from the responses offered by ASA 24. When respondents use these two open-ended text fields, the system assigns default <b>food</b> <b>codes.</b> Nutritionists reviewed these codes and assigned new codes when appropriate. Nutrient and My Pyramid Equivalent (MPE) values from default <b>food</b> <b>codes</b> (unedited) andthe researcher assigned <b>food</b> <b>codes</b> (edited) were compared. Of the 716 <b>food</b> <b>codes</b> evaluated, changes were made to 248 foods (1. 5 % of total foods reported) which affected 194 (19. 1 %) of all recalls and required over 60 hours of specialized staff time.

Currently, the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services is considering {{the implementation of a}} mandatory food safety certification program for all of the state's foodservice establishments beginning in April 2003. Foodservice businesses serving "high risk" populations, such as the young, ill, or elderly, will be the first segment of the industry required to comply with the new guidelines. Other segments of the industry would be phased in over three years. The exact nature of the revision is yet to be determined; however, it will likely require at least one individual from each foodservice establishment to be certified in proper food safety/food handling techniques. This revision will affect more than 21, 000 foodservice businesses that collectively employ 180, 000 workers. To proactively respond to the upcoming changes in the State <b>Food</b> <b>Code,</b> the New Jersey Restaurant Association (NJRA) requires information on the status and nature of other state-mandated food safety certification programs.
