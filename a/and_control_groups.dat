5|$|In {{another of}} her studies, Morgan worked with a fox breeder to {{study the effects of}} diets that {{contained}} low and normal amounts of B vitamins. The experimental group (the vitamin-restricted foxes) developed a fine, sparse gray coat that resembled the fashionable fur of the silver fox. Morgan found that the foxes with normal intake of B vitamins had shiny black fur. After the experiments, a fur stole was made out of fur from both the experimental <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>groups.</b> Morgan wore the stole on at least two important occasions – her presentation of the study data in 1939 and her Garvan Medal award ceremony ten years later.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} common {{limitations}} to studies of treatment effectiveness. Most categorize their participants by behavior rather than erotic age preference, {{which makes it}} difficult to know the specific treatment outcome for pedophiles. Many do not select their treatment <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>groups</b> randomly. Offenders who refuse or quit treatment are at higher risk of offending, so excluding them from the treated group, while not excluding those who would have refused or quit from the control group, can bias the treated group in favor of those with lower recidivism. The effectiveness of treatment for non-offending pedophiles has not been studied.|$|E

25|$|In these {{double-blind}} experiments, {{neither the}} participants nor the researchers know which participants {{belong to the}} control group, nor the test group. Only after all data have been recorded (and, in some cases, analyzed) do the researchers learn which participants were which. Performing an experiment in double-blind fashion can greatly lessen the power of preconceived notions or physical cues (e.g., the placebo effect, observer bias, experimenter's bias) to distort the results (by making researchers or participants behave differently from in everyday life). Random assignment of test subjects to the experimental <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>groups</b> is {{a critical part of}} any double-blind research design. The key that identifies the subjects and which group they belonged to is kept by a third party, and is not revealed to the researchers until the study is over.|$|E
25|$|Another study {{compared}} nineteen {{children with}} a history of ADEM, of which 10 were five years of age or younger at the time (average age 3.8 years old, tested an average of 3.9 years later) and nine were older (mean age 7.7y at time of ADEM, tested an average of 2.2 years later) to nineteen matched controls. Scores on IQ tests and educational achievement were lower for the young onset ADEM group (average IQ 90) compared to the late onset (average IQ 100) <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>groups</b> (average IQ 106), while the late onset ADEM children scored lower on verbal processing speed. Again, all groups means were within one standard deviation of the controls, meaning that while effects were statistically reliable, the children were as a whole, still within the normal range. There were also more behavioural problems in the early onset group, although there is some suggestion that this may be due, at least in part, to the stress of hospitalization at a young age.|$|E
500|$|GWA {{studies have}} several issues and {{limitations}} {{that can be}} taken care of through proper quality control and study setup. Lack of well defined case <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>groups,</b> insufficient sample size, control for multiple testing and control for population stratification are common problems. [...] Particularly the statistical issue of multiple testing wherein it has been noted that [...] "the GWA approach can be problematic because the massive number of statistical tests performed presents an unprecedented potential for false-positive results". Ignoring these correctible issues has been cited as contributing to a general sense of problems with the GWA methodology. In addition to easily correctible problems such as these, some more subtle but important issues have surfaced. A high-profile GWA study that investigated individuals with very long life spans to identify SNPs associated with longevity is an example of this. The publication came under scrutiny because of a discrepancy between the type of genotyping array in the case and control group, which caused several SNPs to be falsely highlighted as associated with longevity. The study was subsequently retracted.|$|E

500|$|There is {{a common}} notion that sugar leads to hyperactivity, in {{particular}} in children, but studies and meta-studies question or address this issue. Some articles and studies do refer to the increasing evidence supporting the links between refined sugar and hyperactivity. The WHO FAO meta-study suggests that such inconclusive results {{are to be expected}} when some studies do not effectively segregate or control for free sugars as opposed to sugars still in their natural form (entirely unrefined) while others do. One study followed thirty-five 5-to-7-year-old boys who were reported by their mothers to be behaviorally [...] "sugar-sensitive." [...] They were randomly assigned to experimental <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>groups.</b> In the experimental group, mothers were told that their children were fed sugar, and, in the control group, mothers were told that their children received a placebo. In fact, all children received the placebo, but mothers in the sugar expectancy condition rated their children as significantly more hyperactive. This result suggests that the real effect of sugar is that it increases worrying among parents with preconceived notions.|$|E

2500|$|As its F-51 Mustangs and F-47 Thunderbolts {{became more}} and more {{obsolescent}} in the jet age of the 1950s, the force structure gradually changed to include a significant number of airlift, tanker, and specialized combat-support units.

[...] Additional command <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>groups</b> and wings were also established by the National Guard Bureau and allocated to the states. [...] The ANG however, unlike the active duty USAF, did not inactivate its combat groups during the 1950s as part of the tri-deputate organization.

2500|$|A 2010 {{systematic}} review suggested that acupuncture {{is more than}} a placebo for commonly occurring chronic pain conditions, but the authors acknowledged that it is still unknown if the overall benefit is clinically meaningful or cost-effective.

The same review found limited evidence that real acupuncture and sham acupuncture appear to produce biological differences despite similar effects. A 2009 {{systematic review}} and meta-analysis found that acupuncture had a small analgesic effect, which appeared to lack any clinical importance and could not be discerned from bias. The same review found that it remains unclear whether acupuncture reduces pain independent of a psychological impact of the needling ritual.

50|$|For the {{conclusions}} {{drawn from the}} results of an experiment to have validity, it is essential that the items or patients assigned to treatment <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>groups</b> be representative of the same population.
