5|$|Brown {{thinks that}} if Planet Nine is {{confirmed}} to exist, a probe could fly by it {{in as little}} as 20 years, with a powered slingshot <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{made by the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, Mu Arae {{exhibits a}} parallax of 64.47 milliarcseconds as the Earth moves <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> When combined with the known distance from the Earth to the Sun, this means the star is located {{at a distance of}} 50.6 light years (15.51 parsecs). Seen from Earth it has an apparent magnitude of +5.12 and is visible to the naked eye.|$|E
50|$|Argentine Army {{officers}} {{wear their}} rank insignia in shoulderboards. Generals and Senior Colonels may be distinguished {{for the red}} trim of their shoulderboards and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>suns</b> denoting their rank; they also wear golden wreath leaves in their coat lapels. <b>The</b> <b>suns</b> for officers below the rank of Senior Colonel are metallic; Senior Colonels and Generals have gold-braid suns.|$|R
50|$|Shalini Kantayya's feature-length documentary, Catching <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> premiered at <b>the</b> 2015 Los Angeles Film Festival and {{was named}} a New York Times Critics’ Pick. It’s also part of American Film Showcase, and will be shown at U.S. {{embassies}} and diplomatic missions <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world. Catching <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> premiered globally on Netflix on Earth Day 2016 with Executive Producer Leonardo DiCaprio and won the Best Feature award at the San Francisco Green Film Festival.|$|R
60|$|When Dan came to {{his senses}} all was dark <b>around</b> him. <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> had set over the timber in the west, and {{scarcely}} a sound broke {{the stillness of the}} night.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers {{observed that the}} Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though {{they did not know}} why; it is today known that {{this is due to the}} movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.|$|E
5|$|Plutoids are {{celestial}} {{bodies in}} orbit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> at a semi-major axis {{greater than that}} of Neptune that have sufficient mass for their self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that they assume a hydrostatic equilibrium (near-spherical) shape, and that have not cleared the neighbourhood around their orbit. Satellites of plutoids are not plutoids themselves.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stars in}} Hyades cluster include Kappa Tauri were photographed during Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919 by the {{expedition}} of Arthur Eddington in Príncipe {{and others in}} Sobral, Brazil that confirmed Albert Einstein's prediction of the bending of light <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> from his {{general theory of relativity}} which he published in 1915.|$|E
60|$|Gabriel {{could only}} stare, and {{struggle}} with {{a tide of}} thick-coming remembrances. He looked <b>around</b> him; <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> was beating down on the old familiar objects, everything was unchanged--and yet this face, this voice.|$|R
5000|$|Driving or hiking to {{the summit}} of Cadillac Mountain to see [...] "the nation's first sunrise" [...] is a popular {{activity}} among visitors of Acadia National Park. However, Cadillac only sees the first sunrise {{in the fall and}} winter, when <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> rises south of due east. During most of the spring and summer, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> rises first on Mars Hill, 150 mi to the northeast. For a few weeks <b>around</b> <b>the</b> equinoxes, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> rises first at West Quoddy Head in Lubec, Maine.|$|R
5000|$|Placet — A {{planet that}} {{revolves}} in a figure-8 orbit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> twin <b>suns</b> Argyle I and Argyle II, and {{is subject to}} several different spatio-temporal anomalies in Fredric Brown's Placet is a Crazy Place.|$|R
5|$|The Solar System's {{planets and}} officially {{recognized}} dwarf planets {{are known to}} be orbited by 184 natural satellites, or moons. 19 moons in the Solar System are large enough to be gravitationally rounded, and thus would be considered planets or dwarf planets if they were in direct orbit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ecliptic}} is {{the circular}} path on the celestial sphere that the Sun appears to follow {{over the course}} of a year; it is the basis of the ecliptic coordinate system. The term also refers to the plane of this path, which is coplanar with Earth's orbit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> (and hence the Sun's apparent orbit around Earth).|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} {{effect of}} the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> are the basis of solar calendars, {{one of which is}} the predominant calendar in use today.|$|E
25|$|The left photo shows a {{diffraction}} ring <b>around</b> <b>the</b> rising <b>Sun</b> {{caused by}} a veil of aerosol. This effect dramatically disappeared when <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> rose high enough until the pattern was no longer visible on the Earth's surface. This phenomenon is sometimes called the corona effect, {{not to be confused}} with the solar corona.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Around</b> midday, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> {{becomes too}} hot for the tortoises, so they return to their hiding places. They have {{a good sense of}} {{direction}} to enable them to return. [...] In the late afternoon, they leave their shelters again and return to feeding.|$|R
25|$|In 1926, the CGT {{released}} an elaborate gold-covered booklet devoted {{entirely to the}} company's new ship. The illustrations depicted huge, ornate yet modern public rooms, female passengers carrying feather fans and smoking cigarettes, and passengers being led <b>around</b> <b>the</b> uncluttered <b>sun</b> deck.|$|R
5|$|The next {{mission to}} {{encounter}} Jupiter was the Ulysses solar probe. It performed a flyby maneuver {{to attain a}} polar orbit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> During this pass, the spacecraft conducted studies on Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ulysses has no cameras so no images were taken. A second flyby six years later was at a much greater distance.|$|E
5|$|Again, {{this is a}} simplification, {{based on}} a {{hypothetical}} Earth that orbits at uniform speed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> The actual speed with which Earth orbits the Sun varies slightly during the year, so {{the speed with which}} the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, the Sun is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days. The variation of orbital speed accounts for part of the equation of time.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's orbit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, {{but not as much}} as does the Moon's varying {{distance from}} Earth. When Earth approaches its farthest {{distance from the}} Sun in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{detected}} X-ray sources at, <b>around,</b> or near <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> {{are within}} or {{associated with the}} coronal cloud which is its outer atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|After Scutaro drew a one-out {{walk in the}} first, Pablo Sandoval {{doubled over}} the head of Jon Jay as the center fielder got turned <b>around</b> {{fighting}} <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> and shadows during the twilight start. Scutaro scored on Posey's groundout to third to give the Giants a 1-0 lead.|$|R
60|$|The {{two boys}} looked <b>around</b> them. <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> had sunk to rest behind the {{mountain}} in the west, and the hollows between the hills were deep in the gloom of the oncoming night. Far back on the trail they had come they saw a small fire start up.|$|R
5|$|Because the Moon's {{orbit around}} Earth is {{inclined}} by about 5.145° (5° 9') to {{the orbit of}} Earth <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon. For an eclipse to occur, the Moon must be near {{the intersection of the}} two orbital planes. The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the Moon, and of the Moon by Earth, is described by the saros, which has a period of approximately 18years.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus clouds, like {{cirrostratus}} clouds, {{can produce}} several optical effects, such as halos <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> and moon. Halos {{are caused by}} interaction of the light with hexagonal ice crystals present in the clouds, which, depending on their shape and orientation, {{can result in a}} wide variety of white and colored rings, arcs and spots in the sky. Common halo varieties are the 22° halo, sun dogs, the circumzenithal arc and the circumhorizontal arc (also known as fire rainbows). Halos produced by cirrus clouds tend to be more pronounced and colorful than those caused by cirrostratus.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impacts {{state of}} health was {{uncertain}} during the first day after launch. Shortly after entering orbit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and deploying its solar panels, the probe switched itself to safe mode. The {{cause of the problem}} was simply an incorrect temperature limit in the fault protection logic for the spacecraft's RCS thruster catalyst beds. The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of safe mode and healthy.|$|E
5000|$|Question 1. The Yaksha asked Yudhisthira, [...] "Who makes <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> {{rise and}} ascend in the skies? Who moves <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>around?</b> Who makes <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> set in <b>the</b> horizons? What {{is the true}} nature of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and where is <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> established"? ...|$|R
60|$|The next day, {{owing to}} the wind, they made but scant progress. It was cloudy, yet just <b>around</b> noon <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> peeped from behind the clouds, and Professor Jeffer hurried to take an observation. Barwell Dawson gave him the correct time, and the old {{scientist}} quickly succeeded in making his computations.|$|R
50|$|The {{battles between}} New Genesis and Apokolips would {{occasionally}} intensify, with neither gaining a significant {{advantage over the}} other. The battles would reach a particularly vicious peak when <b>the</b> planets' orbits <b>around</b> <b>the</b> same <b>sun</b> would bring <b>the</b> two worlds close together {{and all manner of}} planetwide disasters threatened.|$|R
5|$|Earth is {{the third}} planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, {{especially}} the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.|$|E
5|$|If a comet is {{traveling}} fast enough, it may leave the Solar System. Such comets follow the open {{path of a}} hyperbola, and as such they are called hyperbolic comets. To date, comets are only known to be ejected by interacting with another object in the Solar System, such as Jupiter. An {{example of this is}} thought to be Comet C/1980 E1, which was shifted from a predicted orbit of 7.1 million years <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> to a hyperbolic trajectory, after a 1980 close pass by the planet Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Joseph Brady of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory studied {{irregularities}} in {{the motion of}} Halley's Comet. Brady claimed {{that they could have}} been caused by a Jupiter-sized planet beyond Neptune at 59 AU that is in a retrograde orbit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> However, both Marsden and PlanetX proponent P. Kenneth Seidelmann attacked the hypothesis, showing that Halley's Comet randomly and irregularly ejects jets of material, causing changes to its own orbital trajectory, and that such a massive object as Brady's PlanetX would have severely affected the orbits of known outer planets.|$|E
60|$|What a spectacle, {{if anyone}} had come upon them! But they were alone, with the vast arch of sky empty above them and the wide white stretch of sand a desert <b>around</b> them. <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> sank lower and lower, until there was only time to glance through the other papers in the chest.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is a lot}} {{of space}} for {{swimmers}}. For the swimmers that want a workout, they can swim the entire 45 acres. While children can just float <b>around</b> and enjoy <b>the</b> <b>sun.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A small {{mountain}} saddle splits <b>the</b> city of <b>Sun</b> Valley {{into two}} sections. The northern section is centered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> famous <b>Sun</b> Valley Lodge, Inn, and the [...] "village" [...] complex of shops, condominiums, and original 18-hole golf course (27 holes by 2008), which winds {{its way up}} the Trail Creek valley to the northeast. This area {{is referred to as}} simply [...] "Sun Valley." ...|$|R
