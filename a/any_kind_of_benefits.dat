40|$|In literature, empathy {{has been}} {{characterized}} by a disagreement regarding {{the exact nature of}} the phenomenon. There are emotional, cognitive, and conditioning views of empathy, and these views apply to different extents across species. These forms of emotional linkage support group alarm, vicariousness of emotions, mother-infant responsiveness, and the modelling of competitors and predators; these forms have profound effects on reproductive success. 	Taking into account the possible mechanisms underlying gelada’s spontaneous yawn, emotional contagion and emotional response to conflicts between other group members, our results provide information which can have important theoretical implications. In fact, our findings are consistent with the view that contagious yawning reveals an emotional connection between individuals and also that empathy {{could be one of the}} mechanisms involved in triadic post-conflict affiliation. 	We recorded the behaviours of individual belonging to two colonies of geladas, (Theropithecus gelada), a species characterized by a female-centred one-male society, living at the NaturZoo (Rheine, Germany). Data were collected during a 6 -month period in 2007 (June-November), a 4 -month period in 2009 (June-September), a 2 -month period in 2010 (July-August) and a 2 -month period in 2011 (July-August). 	The gelada is a good model species because they have a strong sexual dimorphism, a clear-cut linear hierarchy, high social cohesiveness and fine-tuning towards companions. In the first study, we focussed on some social hypotheses on the potential functions of spontaneous yawning according to its patterns and contexts. Geladas, perform yawning according to three different visual intensity modalities, which are easy to be detected due to the diverse degree of mouth opening. We investigated whether the patterns of the yawn performance is predictive of its potential functions. YW 1, YW 2, and YW 3 can transmit different meanings according to the performer, the context and the behavioural pattern temporally associated to the yawn event. Moreover scratching, used as a reliable measure of anxiety, increased after each yawning type, even though the subjects tended to scratch themselves more after YW 3, thus suggesting that this type of yawn can indicate an even higher variation of arousal. All the three types of yawning were more frequent in the early morning with YW 3 also showing an additional daily peak (pre-feeding). Even though a clear cut functional distinction of the diverse types of gelada yawns is complicated, we suggest that YW 1 and YW 2, being more linked to an emotional internal state, can be considered "true" yawns and YW 3 can function as a multimodal signal which can be more modulated and affected by external social events. 	In the second study we assessed that in gelada baboons yawning is contagious, especially between socially close individuals; in fact, the contagiousness of yawning correlated with the level of grooming between subjects. Adult females showed precise matching of different yawning types, which suggests a mirroring mechanism that activates shared representations. We suggested that females have an enhanced sensitivity and emotional tuning toward companions compared to males. 	In the third study, we tested some hypotheses on the potential functions of triadic affiliation in geladas. We enlightened that the positive outcome of the triadic post-conflict affiliation is focussed more on victims than on bystanders (Self-Protection Hypothesis) or other group members (Tension Reduction Hypothesis), which apparently do not gain <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> by the behaviour. Moreover, it seems that triadic post-conflict affiliation does not have a role in restoring relationships between former opponents (Substitute for Reconciliation Hypothesis), so that reconciliation and triadic post-conflict affiliation co-exist and co-cooperate for two different purposes. After conflicts of high intensity levels, triadic affiliation improves the emotional state of the victim (Consolation Hypothesis) by lowering his/her levels of anxiety, especially when the victim is a kin or a close-bonded partner. In this case, a stronger emotional response can be elicited in the third-party which directs a higher frequency of affinitive acts towards the victim as predicted by the sympathetic concern hypothesis already suggested for humans and apes. 	As a whole, our findings indicate that two of the multiple levels of empathy described in literature for humans and apes (emotional contagion and sympathetic concern) are probably present in monkeys as well...|$|E

40|$|Courtship and Music: An Evolutionary Approach – The {{pervasive}} {{presence of}} music in human life from its embryonic stages onwards helps to explain, in part, the importance attributed {{to it as the}} soundtrack for our emotional experiences. We may assume humans have an inborn musical grammatical code, i. e. a possible evolutionary biological advantage, which would explain a listener’s ability to complete, with the “right” notes, a melody never heard before. The question is whether it might also be possible to identify a shared positive hedonistic tone, corresponding to the same musical stimulus? The propagation of the ability to create music across generations, an ability which can be considered an attempt to penetrate the private theatre of other minds by regulating their most intimate emotions, appears to be expensive, biologically speaking, and to directly result from the action of sexual rather than natural selection. Its production requires, in fact, time and deployment of energy and resources, and apparently does not produce <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> in avoiding predation or obtaining nourishment. Also, testosterone {{has been shown to be}} the main factor in determining the development of those brain regions which modulate the melodic singing in the males of some bird species. Finally, assuming that testosterone, as an index of high genotypic and phenotypic quality, facilitates the functionality of the right brain hemisphere, i. e. the source of musical harmonies, we might expect a corresponding development in the female of a highly tuned/developed ability to identify any element indicative of its presence in a potential partner...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Considering the {{popularity}} of the premium savings certificate (PSC) of the National Savings Bank of Malaysia (Bank Simpanan Nasional (BSN)) the paper aims to justify the Shari'ah compliancy of this product by analyzing its underlying contracts and to propose a Shari'ah compliant savings certificate, if the current practice is invalid in the Shari'ah. Design/methodology/approach – Inductive methodology is first used to obtain a basic understanding of this product and the characteristics of Shari'ah approved contracts as well as the views of the jurists. Interviewing method is also used to acquire first-hand information when the inductive method is not sufficient. Afterwards, an analytical approach is adopted to justify the validity of this contract with the Shari'ah principles. Finally, an innovative methodology is used to propose a Shari'ah compliant savings certificate. Findings – The paper argues that the underlying contract used in PSC violates the conditions of wadi'ah contract, as in wadi'ah, the bank is not allowed to spend the money for investment, but in practice, BSN uses the money for investment. Therefore, the underlying contract in PSC turns into qard (loan) contract. Since the scholars unanimously declare that giving <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> like prizes to the creditor is riba, then PSC is considered as invalid according to the Shari'ah. On the other hand, although PSC might seem like gambling, it is different from gambling as the prizes given to PSC are from a third party. The paper proposes implementing mudarabah contract in PSC where the bank is allowed to invest according to its interest and the depositors share the profit and loss but the huge fluctuation of profit and loss could be shrunk by a special fund method. Originality/value – In particular, it attracts the attention of BSN management to change their product's features. In general, it discovers a non-Shari'ah compliant feature of savings certificates and outlines the feature of a Shari'ah compliant saving certificate for the practitioners of Islamic banking all over the world.

40|$|Weber, Blais and Bets (2002) {{found that}} {{difference}} in risk attitudes and behaviour {{can depend on}} the context: individuals can change risk attitude across different domains. Among these domains are financial, which consists of investment and gambling, social, recreational, health/safety and ethical. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the differences in risk attitudes between the Czech Republic and Russia. For this purpose data for the empirical analysis was gathered using a questionnaire based on Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) Scale proposed by Weber, Blais and Betz (2002). The collected {{data were analyzed using}} linear regression, following Weber, Blais and Betz (2002) and Breuer et al. (2013). The main findings revealed that there is a difference in risk attitude: the participants from Russian sample tend to be more risk-seeking in financial domain, especially in gambling, than the respondents from Czech sample.

40|$|Abstract This {{thesis is}} a retrospective- and {{prospective}} study of 372 long-term sick listed individuals with {{diseases of the}} locomotor system that underwent vocational rehabilitation conducted by the Social Insurance Office in the County of Västernorrland during the 1990 s. The outcome of commercial rehabilitation services financed by the Insurance was evaluated in terms of return to work, sickness benefit and disability pension after 1, 3, and 10 years in relation to demographic data, Sense of Coherence, Perceived Health and a created index of potential psychosocial stress labelled Psychosocial Marker. In Paper I, the Psychosocial Marker was introduced and the probands were followed up after 3 years. For men problems related to alcohol abuse dominated and for women problems related to their private life. Only {{one third of the}} markers were related to problems in working life. At the follow-up time the risk for a full disability pension was 2. 5 (ns.) for men and 4. 3 (sign.) for women who had a Psychosocial Marker. In Paper II, outcome for the study group was evaluated I relation Sense of Coherence and Perceived Health. After three years, men who were granted disability pension had significantly lower Sense of Coherence compared with women whereas both men and women had a significantly lower Perceived Health. The differences were interpreted in terms lower mental health and coping ability for men and a higher social acceptance for disability pension in combination with less income reduction for women. In Paper III, the study group was divided in two diagnostic groups one with a localized disorder of the low back and one with a generalized disorder in terms of cervical neck pain and/or a general pain syndrome. Men with a generalized disorder were found to be more often single and had a lower Sense of Coherence and women more often had a Psychosocial Marker and worse Perceived Health. At the 10 -year follow-up, women with a generalized disorder more often had <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> sickness <b>benefit</b> and/or disability pension. In Paper IV, the study group was evaluated against all previous studied variables. After 10 years 52 % of the men and 57 % of the women were granted <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> disability pension. Age above middle for the group and a low Perceived Health increased the risk for a full disability pension after 3 and 10 years for both men and women. Of the men, 82 % with low Perceived Health and of the women, 82 % with a Psychosocial Marker or low Perceived Health were on <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> sickness <b>benefit</b> 10 years after rehabilitation. Altogether high age and low Perceived Health were the most important factors. Conclusion: Outcome of rehabilitation is related to psychosocial factors in terms of Psychosocial Marker, Sense of Coherence and Perceived Health together with diagnosis, gender and age.

40|$|Historically, actuaries {{have been}} calculating {{premiums}} and mathematical reserves using a deterministic approach, by considering a deterministic mortality intensity, {{which is a}} function of the age only, extracted from available (static) life tables and by setting a flat ("best estimate") interest rate to discount cash flows over time. Since neither the mortality intensity nor interest rates are actually deterministic, life insurance companies and pension funds are exposed to both financial and mortality (systematic and unsystematic) risks when pricing and reserving for <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> long-term living <b>benefits,</b> particularly on annuities and pensions. In this paper, we assume that an appropriate description of the demographic risks requires the use of stochastic models. In particular, we assume that the random evolution of the stochastic force of mortality of an individual can be modelled by using doubly stochastic processes. The model is then embedded into the well know affine-jump framework, widely used in the term structure literature, in order to derive closed-form solutions for the survival probability. We show that stochastic mortality models provide an adequate framework for the development of longevity risk hedging tools, namely mortality-linked contracts such as longevity bonds or mortality derivatives...|$|R

40|$|Background: Improved {{survival}} for childhood and adolescent cancer patients due to advances in medical and supportive {{care is a}} great achievement of modern medicine. As the number of long-term survivors of cancer in childhood and adolescence is growing rapidly, increasing attention is being paid to the possible impact {{of the disease and}} its treatment on long-term health and social performance. Impact of cancer in childhood (0 – 14 years), adolescence (15 – 19 years) and young adulthood (20 – 24 years) on early cancer death, uptake <b>of</b> social security <b>benefits</b> and educational attainment has been explored in a national cohort. Material and methods: All children born alive in Norway during 1965 – 1985 were identified by the Norwegian Central Population Registry and defined as the study cohort (approximately 1. 2 million individuals). By linkage to the Cancer Registry of Norway, all children (N= 2, 481), adolescents (N= 1, 289) and young adults (N= 2, 032) diagnosed with cancer were identified. The cohort was followed from birth into adulthood by further linkage to compulsory national databases; the Cause of Death Registry, the National Insurance Scheme, and the Norwegian National Education Database. These registries include data on mortality, social security benefits, and education which were the main outcomes. Data were analysed by applying various regression models that allow for adjustment for confounders; Cox regression, logistic regression and competing risk model. Standardized incidence ratios were used in cases of rare outcomes. Results: Differences in overall mortality between the cancer patients and the cancer-free population decreased during our study period. Early cancer mortality (within 5 -years after diagnosis) for all cancers also decreased since 1965. Overall, there were relatively fewer cancer-related deaths among female than male patients. Adolescents and young adult patients had lower risk of cancer death than children in general, except for patients who were diagnosed with leukaemia (all combined). Overall, 5 -year cancer survivors were 4. 4 times more likely to receive <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> social security <b>benefits</b> than the cancer-free population. Survivors from bone and connective/soft tissue tumours, central nervous system (CNS) tumours and leukaemia were most likely to be recipients <b>of</b> social security <b>benefits.</b> After neoplasms, the most common causes of receiving social security <b>benefits</b> were diseases <b>of</b> the nervous system, and injury and poisoning. In general, completion of education was lower among 5 -year cancer survivors than the cancer-free population at all levels i. e. intermediate, under graduate and graduate education. Mainly survivors of CNS-tumours and those assumed to have received CNSdirected therapy were at risk of educational deficits and experienced some delays in completion of an educational level. However, educational impairment diminished at higher levels of education, and consequently choice of educational fields was similar for the cancer survivors and the cancer-free population. Conclusions: More cancer patients become 5 -year survivors today compared to earlier. These survivors are at increased risk of late effects. Medical surveillance and supportive care is therefore of high importance for the cancer survivors. Special attention should be paid to survivors of CNS-tumours, leukaemia and bone and connective/soft tissues tumours since they were at higher risk for late effects compared with other survivors. Careful follow-up of cancer survivors during their education is also recommended in order to maximize educational achievements. </p...|$|R
