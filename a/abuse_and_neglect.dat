5|$|While RAD {{is likely}} to occur {{following}} neglectful and abusive childcare, {{there should be no}} automatic diagnosis on this basis alone as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> <b>neglect.</b> Abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. Experiences of abuse are associated with the development of disorganised attachment, in which the child prefers a familiar caregiver, but responds to that person in an unpredictable and somewhat bizarre way. Within official classifications, attachment disorganization is a risk factor but not in itself an attachment disorder. Further although attachment disorders tend to occur in the context of some institutions, repeated changes of primary caregiver or extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether male <b>and</b> female <b>abused</b> <b>and</b> <b>neglected</b> children report {{higher levels of}} intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration in young adulthood than a matched control group. We also examined whether this association was mediated by early aggressive behavior, adult antisocial personality disorder, hostility, and problem drinking for men and women. The sample consisted of individuals who had official records of child abuse and/or neglect prior to age 12 and matched controls who were followed up and interviewed at approximately age 29 years. Individuals who had ever been married or lived with someone (N= 961) reported on lifetime perpetration of IPV. For the total sample, <b>abused</b> <b>and</b> <b>neglected</b> children reported significantly higher rates of ever hitting or throwing things at a partner, ever hitting or throwing first, and ever hitting or throwing first more than once. Both male <b>and</b> female <b>abused</b> <b>and</b> <b>neglected</b> children reported significantly higher rates of ever hitting or throwing things at a partner than matched controls. Antisocial personality disorder mediated the effects of abuse/neglect on IPV for men and women and hostility and alcohol problems also mediated the effects for <b>abused</b> <b>and</b> <b>neglected</b> women. Early aggressive behavior was not a significant mediator for either gender. Overall the results reveal a link between early childhood victimization an...|$|R
