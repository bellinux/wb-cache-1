5|$|The incongruous make-up {{between the}} Western lower half and Thai roof has been {{compared}} with a Farang (Western) lady clothed in Victorian costume while wearing a Thai crown. The symbolism of this juxtaposition is the emphasis of the superiority of Thai architecture (as a crown upon the head) over those of the West (the {{lower half of the}} body). This stylistic innovation was more than an artistic coincidence, as it was supposed to convey a significant political message of Siamese resistance over Western imperialism, both of sovereignty and style. From <b>another</b> <b>perspective,</b> the building itself epitomizes the internal political struggle between the ideas of Westernization and modernity (led by King Rama V) against those of the traditional ruling elites (as led by some of his early ministers).|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century.

5|$|One CMPC {{shooting}} {{location was}} on family property near Boulder Creek, California where Middleton's father {{had established a}} timber holding {{now known as the}} Middleton Tract. Other filming locations included undeveloped portions of Sonoma, Santa Cruz and Marin counties. In San Rafael, the studio boasted a large glass-walled and -roofed building that let in light but not wind so that shooting for indoor scenes could take place in full light without the telltale flapping of tablecloths and clothing blown by gusts. Considered expensive at the time, the company used a 1,250 Bell & Howell movie camera, worth about $ in current value. The camera held two reels of film so that two negatives were made of each scene. A second $700 camera provided a third reel of the same scene, from <b>another</b> <b>perspective.</b>|$|E
5|$|The losses {{suffered}} {{by both the}} Egyptians and the Israelis in the battle were severe. Israeli units suffered heavy casualties in men and equipment; Reshef's armored losses during {{the first night of}} the battle alone were comparable to Egyptian armored losses on the disastrous October 14 offensive. For their part, the numbers of Egyptian armored forces within 16th Division's bridgehead severely dwindled. As of 18 October the 21st Armored Division had no more than 40 tanks remaining of an original 136 tanks available {{at the start of the}} battle (not counting 21 tanks received as reinforcements), while the 16th Infantry Division had just 20 tanks remaining in its organic tank battalion.

40|$|Taking <b>another’s</b> <b>perspective</b> {{is central}} to {{effective}} social interactions. Understanding <b>another’s</b> visual <b>perspective</b> (e. g. what another person can see (level 1), and how another person can see something (level 2)) can help to resolve potential ambiguities in social communication. This research takes a novel approach by exploring {{the extent to which}} biases in a person’s thoughts, the saliency of objects in the environment, and the environment itself affects the ability to take <b>another’s</b> visual <b>perspective.</b> In study 1, we explored whether a distracting environment (e. g. a bar for social drinkers) and specific thoughts (cravings for alcohol) impacted visual perspective-taking. Results showed that neither had a significant effect on perspective-taking ability (ps >. 1). In study 2, we explored whether the presence of personally salient objects (e. g. alcohol objects in social drinkers) interfered with visual perspective-taking. These objects delayed visual perspective-taking when they were visually available to both parties and there was inconsistent information between the perspectives (p <. 05). In study 3, we examined the role of objects further by exploring whether the frequency of exposure to unfamiliar objects (e. g. abstract symbols) affected visual perspective-taking. Here the frequency of occurrence did not affect perspective-taking. Together, these findings indicate that the salient nature of objects, rather than specific environments or related cognitions, impact the ability to effectively take others’ visual perspective, but only where they relate to a specific context (e. g. alcohol cues instead of abstract symbols). We will discuss implications for the impact of external influences on taking <b>another’s</b> <b>perspective...</b>|$|R

40|$|Past {{research}} on level 2 visual perspective-taking (VPT) has mostly focused on understanding the mental rotation involved when one adopts others' perspective; the mechanisms underlying how the visual world of others is mentally represented remain unclear. In three studies, we addressed this question by adopting a novel VPT task with motion stimuli and exploring the aftereffect on motion discrimination from the self-perspective. Overall {{the results showed}} a facilitation aftereffect when participants were instructed to take the avatar's perspective. Meanwhile, participants' self-reported perspective-taking tendencies correlated with the aftereffect for both instructed and spontaneous VPT tasks, when the “to-be-adopted” perspective required the participants to mentally transform their self-body clockwise. Specifically, while facilitation was induced for participants with low self-reported perspective-taking tendencies (e. g., viewing a leftward motion stimulus under <b>another's</b> <b>perspective</b> enhanced subsequent perception of leftward motion from the self-perspective), those with high self-reported perspective-taking tendencies showed an adaptation aftereffect (e. g., viewing a leftward motion stimulus under <b>another's</b> <b>perspective</b> weakened subsequent perception of leftward motion from the self-perspective). For these individuals, the adaptation effect indicated the engagement of direction-selective neurons in processing of the subsequent congruent-direction motion from self's perspective. These findings suggest that motion perception from different <b>perspectives</b> (self vs. <b>another)</b> may share the same direction-selective neural circuitry, and this possibility depends on observers' general perspective-taking tendencies...|$|R

Others have said that it was unlikely the Luftwaffe would ever be able to destroy RAF Fighter Command. If British losses became severe, the RAF could simply have withdrawn northward and regrouped. It could then deploy when, or if, the Germans launched an invasion. Most historians agree Sea Lion would have failed regardless, because of the weaknesses of German sea power compared to the Royal Navy.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{ability to}} see things from <b>another's</b> <b>perspective,</b> that is, have a theory of mind (ToM), is {{essential}} to effective communication. So too {{is the ability to}} regulate verbal output, that is, to exercise executive control. People with traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) have impaired communication abilities, but the extent to which this reflects ToM versus executive dysfunction is unclear. This study explored the relative contributions of executive abilities, specifically flexibility and inhibition and ToM abilities in language production post-TBI. Method: Twenty-five adults (18 males: mean age of 48. 2 years, SD = 12. 0 years) with moderate to severe TBI (posttraumatic amnesia = 69. 2, SD = 54. 6 days) and 28 noninjured adults (19 males: mean age 49. 0, SD = 12. 2 years) completed three sets of communication tasks with low executive demands, high flexibility, and high inhibition demands. Within each, parallel versions had low or high ToM requirements. Results: For low executive and high flexibility tasks, scores on the high ToM versions were predicted by scores on the low ToM versions, suggesting that poor performance was explained by the executive demands the parallel tasks had in common. The exception was the high inhibition task. In this case, speakers with TBI had differential difficulty with the high ToM version, that is, they had specific difficulty inhibiting self-referential thoughts in order to cater for <b>another's</b> <b>perspective.</b> Conclusion: We found problems with inhibiting the self-perspective accords with descriptive accounts of the egocentric nature of some communication patterns following TBI, which points to potential targets for remediation. © 2014 American Psychological Association...|$|R
