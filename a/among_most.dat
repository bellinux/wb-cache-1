5|$|The list of benzodiazepines {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of insomnia is fairly similar <b>among</b> <b>most</b> countries, but which benzodiazepines are officially designated as first-line hypnotics prescribed {{for the treatment of}} insomnia varies between countries. Longer-acting benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam and diazepam have residual effects that may persist into the next day and are, in general, not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2002, DiCaprio {{appeared}} in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York, a historical film {{set in the}} mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City. Director Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader of the Irish faction, and thus, Miramax Films got involved with financing the project. Nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in a marathon eight-month shoot and, at US$103 million, the most expensive film Scorsese had ever made. Upon its release, Gangs of New York became a financial and critical success. DiCaprio's acting was well-received but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis' performance <b>among</b> <b>most</b> critics.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there was}} no desire {{for a change in}} the form of {{government}} <b>among</b> <b>most</b> Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'√©tat that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. PedroII had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent {{the last two years of}} his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.|$|E
5|$|Christian metal bands {{exist in}} most of the subgenres of heavy metal music, and the only common link <b>among</b> <b>most</b> Christian metal bands are the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with the {{subjects}} of the genre the band is rooted in, regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a direct connection or reference to the Christian faith but often it does.|$|E
5|$|In some species, {{both parents}} care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the {{responsibility}} of only one sex. In some species, other members of the same species‚Äîusually close relatives of the breeding pair, such as offspring from previous broods‚Äîwill help with the raising of the young. Such alloparenting is particularly common among the Corvida, which includes such birds as the true crows, Australian magpie and fairy-wrens, but has been observed in species as different as the rifleman and red kite. <b>Among</b> <b>most</b> groups of animals, male parental care is rare. In birds, however, it is quite common‚Äîmore so than in any other vertebrate class. Though territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{cannibalism}} {{is common}} <b>among</b> <b>most</b> predatory species of mantises in captivity. It {{has sometimes been}} observed in natural populations, where {{about a quarter of}} male-female encounters result in the male being eaten by the female. Around 90% of the predatory species of mantises participate in sexual cannibalism. Adult males typically outnumber females at first, but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in the adult stage, possibly because females selectively eat the smaller males. In Tenodera sinensis, 83% of males escape cannibalism after an encounter with a female, but since multiple matings occur, the probability of a male's being eaten increases cumulatively.|$|E
5|$|The {{female worker}} ants {{do not have}} wings and {{reproductive}} females lose their wings after their mating flights in order to begin their colonies. Therefore, unlike their wasp ancestors, most ants travel by walking. Some species are capable of leaping. For example, Jerdon's jumping ant (Harpegnathos saltator) is able to jump by synchronising the action of its mid and hind pairs of legs. There are several species of gliding ant including Cephalotes atratus; {{this may be a}} common trait <b>among</b> <b>most</b> arboreal ants. Ants with this ability are able to control the direction of their descent while falling.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} main {{handwritten}} {{forms of the}} Deseret alphabet: a cursive version and a printed version. Over the lifetime of the alphabet, the cursive form fell out of favor <b>among</b> <b>most</b> users of the alphabet and by 1856 no more cursive documents exist. Its impact on the glyphs can however still be plainly seen in the loops of certain characters such as êëÖ, êëÄ and êêº. The earliest surviving versions of the Deseret alphabet, from 1853 (one year before its January 1854 approval), have printed and cursive forms side-by-side, suggesting that a cursive form {{was part of the}} plan from the very beginning.|$|E

5|$|The {{first round}} {{was the longest}} {{in the history of}} the NFL draft, lasting six hours, eight minutes. One of the big stories of the draft was the fall of Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn. Quinn had been {{projected}} as a potential first overall pick in early mock drafts and had been invited to attend the draft in person, but he wasn't selected until the 22nd pick in the first round by the Cleveland Browns, who acquired the pick in a trade with the Dallas Cowboys. Louisiana State University quarterback JaMarcus Russell was selected first overall by the Oakland Raiders after he had replaced Quinn as the projected first selection <b>among</b> <b>most</b> analysts following his performance in the 2007 Sugar Bowl against Quinn and Notre Dame. Russell is considered by many as one of the biggest draft busts in NFL history, and Quinn also had a largely unsuccessful pro career.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} structure after the Holy Mother of God {{church is a}} rectangular chapel built against its western wall.

A small structure with a lean-to roof {{is attached to the}} north wall of the main church. It was used to store ceremonial items. On the north-western side of the monastery, a single nave and ridge-roofed church is located detached from the main church. Another building that hasn't survived used to be located next to it. Numerous dilapidated dwellings and auxiliary structures are scattered in the territory of the fortress such as a two-story building believed to be a residence for guards. There are traditional networks of tunnels, crypts, water reservoirs and wine cellars, found <b>among</b> <b>most</b> monasteries of medieval Armenia.
