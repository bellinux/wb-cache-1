5|$|The Streatham {{portrait}} {{bears the}} <b>accession</b> <b>number</b> of NPG 6804 {{and is considered}} part of the gallery's primary collection. From January 2007 until early 2010 it was displayed in the Tudor Gallery.

5|$|The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database uses a {{flat file}} {{plaintext}} format to represent and store data which is typically {{referred to as}} EMBL-Bank format. EMBL-Bank format uses a different syntax to the records in DDBJ and GenBank, though each format uses certain standardised nomenclature, such as taxonomies {{as defined by the}} NCBI Taxon database. Each line of an EMBL-format file beings with a two-letter code, such as AC to label the <b>accession</b> <b>number</b> and KW for a list of keywords relevant to the record; each record ends with //.|$|E
5|$|The {{gene for}} apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5, gene ID 116519, OMIM <b>accession</b> <b>number</b> – 606368) was {{originally}} found by comparative sequencing {{of human and}} mice DNA as a last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins APOA1/APOC3/APOA4/APOA5, located on human chromosome 11 at position 11q23. The creation of two mice models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knock-out) confirmed {{the important role of}} this gene in plasma triglyceride determination. The transgenic mice had lower and the knock-out mice higher levels of plasma triglycerides, while plasma cholesterol levels remained unchanged in both animal models.|$|E
