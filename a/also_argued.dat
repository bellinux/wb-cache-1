5|$|The United States was {{represented}} by Louis F. Claiborne, assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General. The United States <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> that the Menominee Termination Act did not extinguish hunting and fishing rights under the 1854 treaty and therefore the tribe was not due compensation from the United States. Claiborne <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> that whatever regulatory rights which were held {{by the federal government}} were transferred to the state of Wisconsin by the termination act.|$|E
5|$|He opposed {{universal}} suffrage, and favored {{limiting the}} franchise {{to half of}} free men, and allowing slaveholders to cast votes on behalf of three-fifths of their slaves; he <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> in favor of eliminating the secret ballot. Tucker also promoted the Second National Bank and strongly criticized Jackson for defunding it.|$|E
5|$|In their articles, {{the champions}} of each state argued that Pike's {{account of his}} route {{supported}} their site, and entirely ruled out the other. Both sides <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> that Pike's description of the local topography matched their site and differed significantly from the other.|$|E
50|$|The book <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> against {{vivisection}} and for vegetarianism.|$|R

5000|$|Love and Theft {{extensively}} {{documents the}} racism and cultural appropriation inherent in blackface performance; Lott <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> that it demonstrates a current of homosexual desire for Black men's bodies; he <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> that [...] "mixed in with vicious parodies and lopsided appropriation, minstrelsy involved a real love of African American culture." ...|$|R
5|$|NESCo <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> {{that they}} had chosen the site to protect the city's amenities, {{in that it was}} outside the city boundary, {{partially}} surrounded by higher ground, and in the lee of prevailing winds. They also said that much could be done architecturally to fit the station into its surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Other {{authors have}} <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> that {{indirect}} land use changes produce other significant {{social and environmental}} impacts, affecting biodiversity, water quality, food prices and supply, land tenure, worker migration, and community and cultural stability.|$|E
5|$|Thio <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> {{that without}} a constitutionally {{expressed}} right to vote, the judiciary is handicapped in interpreting this implied right, given its conservative approach to reading the Constitution {{and the fact that}} it is unlikely to appeal to normative ideas such as representative democracy.|$|E
5000|$|DeMint <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> that {{same-sex}} marriage infringes upon religious liberty: ...|$|R
50|$|Branch <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> that Jeroboam's {{wife was}} abused by her husband.|$|R
25|$|Abd-al-Munim Al-Nimr, <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> that riba must involve {{harm to the}} debtor.|$|R
5|$|Alastair Hudson has <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the}} fraud {{argument}} is significantly flawed. The {{theory suggests that}} liability for the property comes about from fraud; in fact, liability comes about {{as soon as the}} trustee accepts the property to hold on trust, and so the fraud theory is not necessary to bind the trustee's hands.|$|E
5|$|An {{expert panel}} of {{engineers}} {{released a report}} outlining concerns regarding the decreased loop ramp radii {{and a lack of}} protective guardrail at sharp curves, in addition to the lack of a concrete median barrier to separate the opposite directions of travel. However, it was <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> that the large grass median was sufficient to prevent cross-over collisions, given that Highway410 has a similar median.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{arguments}} {{over whether or}} not austerity, rather than increased or frozen spending, is a macroeconomic solution, union leaders have <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> that the working population is being unjustly held responsible for the economic mismanagement errors of economists, investors, and bankers. Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed {{as a consequence of the}} global economic crisis of 2007–2010, and this has led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe, but the entire world.|$|E
50|$|Critics <b>also</b> <b>argue</b> {{that some}} fairy doors are overly gaudy and garish.|$|R
50|$|Taleb <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> {{for the use}} of {{counterfactual}} reasoning when considering risk.|$|R
50|$|Merkle <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> {{for gender}} distinctions {{on the basis}} of 1 Corinthians 11.|$|R
5|$|Blythe's {{defense team}} {{attacked}} {{differences between the}} testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in 2010 and at the court. Among other things, one of the witnesses originally alleged that Nosek and Blythe shook hands or {{that one of them}} offered hand to another on stage; however, at the court hearing, he testified that there was no prior contact between them. Blythe <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior.|$|E
5|$|Cicero {{stated the}} twins {{objection}} (that with close birth times, personal outcomes {{can be very}} different), later developed by Saint Augustine. He argued that since the other planets are much more distant from the earth than the moon, they could have only very tiny influence compared to the moon's. He <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> that if astrology explains everything about a person's fate, then it wrongly ignores the visible effect of inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by medicine, or {{the effects of the}} weather on people.|$|E
5|$|Consequences of this {{include the}} time–space frame of a moving body {{appearing}} {{to slow down}} and contract (in the direction of motion) when measured in the frame of the observer. This paper <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.|$|E

5000|$|He <b>also</b> <b>argues</b> the {{following}} strategies assist incumbents in succeeding against the disruptive technology ...|$|R
5|$|Hill <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> {{that if the}} Electoral Act {{actually}} {{appeared to}} confer jurisdiction on the court, it was nevertheless invalid, as the determination of disputes about election results is a non-judicial function. Also, the doctrine of separation of powers meant that non-judicial power cannot be conferred on a Chapter III Court such as the High Court.|$|E
5|$|In response, Assistant to the Solicitor General Matthew D. Roberts argued {{on behalf}} of the United States that patient care and not {{educational}} curricula occupies the vast majority of residents' time. He <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> that although the 1939 FICA Amendment had originally specifically exempted interns, residents who had not yet obtained their unrestricted medical license, that exemption was removed in 1965 to allow doctors to begin paying into Social Security earlier so that they could be eligible for certain benefits.|$|E
5|$|Maeser {{believed}} that religion {{played a key}} role in true education. He viewed each student as a child of God that had an individual capacity and potential. He thought that all schools should adhere to some religious aspect. He <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> that public high schools should be supplemented by religion classes. Maeser, however, was respectful of other religious denominations although Brigham Young Academy and Brigham Young University integrated beliefs from the LDS Church.|$|E

5|$|Republicans portrayed slavery as uncivilized {{and argued}} for {{abolition}} {{as a necessary}} step in national progress. Amendment supporters <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> that the slave system had negative effects on white people. These included the lower wages resulting from competition with forced labor, as well as repression of abolitionist whites in the South. Advocates said ending slavery would restore the First Amendment and other constitutional rights violated by censorship and intimidation in slave states.|$|E
5|$|Several German art {{experts have}} {{attempted}} to refute all the claims made by Hawass, pointing to the 1924 document discussing the pact between Borchardt and the Egyptian authorities, though, as discussed earlier, Borchardt {{has been accused of}} foul play in the deal. The German authorities have <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> the bust is too fragile to transport and that the legal arguments for the repatriation were insubstantial. According to The Times, Germany may be concerned that lending the bust to Egypt would mean its permanent departure from Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Caledonian Union, {{one of the}} {{political}} parties within the pro-independence FLNKS group had, in 2010, appealed for a national committee to evaluate progress and prepare New Caledonia for the change in leadership before the planned referendum in 2014. In this appeal, the UC <b>also</b> <b>argued</b> that, according to the Nouméa Accord, it was obligatory for the French government to train and build the capacity of Kanaks {{to be able to}} take over the government in 2014 and urged them to respond swiftly.|$|E
