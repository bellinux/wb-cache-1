From here a steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff top, which in turn offers <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> castle via the Water Gate in the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of earthworks, surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward.

5|$|As {{part of the}} project, Tonkin Highway was {{expanded}} from two to three lanes in both directions, between Great Eastern Highway and Roe Highway, with the existing intersections in this section becoming grade separated. A new diamond interchange was constructed with Dunreath Drive to provide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> domestic terminal precinct, replacing Brearley Avenue as the main <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> precinct. International terminal access was provided via a new freeway-to-freeway cloverstack interchange at Leach Highway, and a single-point urban interchange at the intersection with Horrie Miller Drive and Kewdale Road. The existing diamond interchange with Roe Highway was upgraded to a partial freeway-to-freeway interchange, but with plans to further upgrade it to a completely free-flowing interchange in the future.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Electric vehicle {{charging}} stations are high-power load {{after they are}} <b>accessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grid. Therefore it may result in the redistribution of the grid load, which leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> change of the power flow and the grid loss increases. The load model of charging stations is established in a typical distribution network model in this paper. The impact on the distribution network power flow after the electric {{vehicle charging}} stations <b>accessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grid is calculated. And then some measures <b>to</b> reduce <b>the</b> network loss are brought up, which are proved by relational calculation cases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Aggregate R-B-tree (aRB-tree) {{provides}} a framework for supporting OLAP operations over spatio-temporal data. Although existing aRB-tree implementations process sptio-temporal aggregate queries pretty efficiently, it is hardly applicable for online processing due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> excessive <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aggregate B-trees of the entries in the R-tree and the overlap in the R-tree. This paper addresses these problems by proposing several techniques that completely avoid the overlap in the R-tree and significantly reduce <b>the</b> excessive <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> B-trees during the update. We further extended original aRB-tree to aRBB +-tree which can process the threshold aggregate queries more efficiently. 1...|$|R
