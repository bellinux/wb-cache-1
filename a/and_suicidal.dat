5|$|Falun Gong sources {{overseas}} {{questioned the}} official Chinese government {{account of the}} event, and apparent inconsistencies in government's official narrative led to a hypothesis that the self-immolation was staged {{by the government to}} justify the persecution against Falun Gong by portraying its practitioners as irrational <b>and</b> <b>suicidal.</b> According to this hypothesis, the self-immolation participants were paid actors, and were presumably assured that the flames would be extinguished before doing real harm.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1990, Slayer {{proposed}} a major tour featuring American thrash metal bands. Megadeth accepted, joining Slayer, Testament, <b>and</b> <b>Suicidal</b> Tendencies {{for the successful}} European Clash of the Titans tour. An American leg began the following year featuring Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, with Alice in Chains as a supporting act. The tour was considered a multi-headliner, as the three main bands alternated time slots. In addition to the Clash of the Titans tour, Megadeth played with Judas Priest in North America late in 1990 and appeared at the second Rock in Rio festival in January 1991.|$|E

5|$|Paradoxical reactions, such as {{increased}} seizures in epileptics, aggression, violence, impulsivity, irritability <b>and</b> <b>suicidal</b> behavior sometimes occur. These reactions have been explained as consequences of disinhibition {{and the subsequent}} loss of control over socially unacceptable behavior. Paradoxical reactions are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1% and similar to placebo. However, they occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with borderline personality disorder, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. In these groups, impulse control problems {{are perhaps the most}} important risk factor for disinhibition; learning disabilities and neurological disorders are also significant risks. Most reports of disinhibition involve high doses of high-potency benzodiazepines. Paradoxical effects may also appear after chronic use of benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|The group {{started the}} Countdown to Extinction tour in 1992 with Pantera <b>and</b> <b>Suicidal</b> Tendencies as the opening acts. They headlined the Roskilde Festival in Copenhagen on June 27 the same year, and {{continued}} with dates in Europe during the summer. The tour carried on throughout 1993, {{with the band}} making appearances {{on a number of}} large festivals. In January they performed in the United States with Stone Temple Pilots as the supporting act. Although these two bands had scheduled tour dates in Japan during the month of May, the dates were subsequently canceled. In June 1993, Megadeth played at the Milton Keynes National Bowl with Diamond Head and later opened for Iron Maiden and Metallica on their European tour. After finishing their major European tour, the band began a US tour which eventually ended on December 8, 1993.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{typically}} include {{sensory impairment}} (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation {{and a lack}} of coordination. The type and degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and duration of exposure. Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3. A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis. Acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects, including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium, hallucinations, <b>and</b> <b>suicidal</b> tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including erethism, irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.|$|E

40|$|Male {{mortality}} rates exceeded female rates in every death type and the sex differential increased from 1970 to 1980 in every death type except homicides. The {{findings in this}} study suggest that marital and employment factors contribute to sex differences in mortality for <b>suicidal</b> <b>and</b> accidental deaths. Being employed was associated with fewer <b>suicidal</b> <b>and</b> accidental deaths for females than for males. Being married was associated with fewer <b>suicidal</b> <b>and</b> accidental deaths for males, while marital status had no relationship to <b>suicidal</b> <b>and</b> accidental deaths for females. Due to these relationships it might be inferred that the expanding sex differential in <b>suicidal</b> <b>and</b> accidental {{mortality rates}} is associated with the spiraling divorce rate and the dramatic increase in female employment. Results relative to homicidal deaths appear ambiguous and do not offer support for the hypothesis that marital and employment factors contribute to the observed sex differences in homicidal death rates...|$|R
40|$|Background Suicide is {{a leading}} cause of death worldwide, but the precise effect of {{childhood}} adversities as risk factors for the onset <b>and</b> persistence of <b>suicidal</b> behaviour (suicide ideation, plans and attempts) are not well understood. Aims To examine the associations between childhood adversities as risk factors for the onset <b>and</b> persistence of <b>suicidal</b> behaviour across 21 countries worldwide. Method Respondents from nationally representative samples (n = 55 299) were interviewed regarding childhood adversities that occurred before the age of 18 years <b>and</b> lifetime <b>suicidal</b> behaviour. Results Childhood adversities were associated with an increased risk of suicide attempt and ideation in both bivariate and multivariate models (odds ratio range 1. 2 - 5. 7). The risk increased with the number of adversities experienced, but at a decreasing rate. Sexual and physical abuse were consistently the strongest risk factors for both the onset <b>and</b> persistence of <b>suicidal</b> behaviour, especially during adolescence. Associations remained similar after additional adjustment for respondents` lifetime mental disorder status. Conclusions Childhood adversities (especially intrusive or aggressive adversities) are powerful predictors of the onset <b>and</b> persistence of <b>suicidal</b> behaviours...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Social {{influences}} – {{including the}} <b>suicidal</b> <b>and</b> self-harming behaviours of others – have been highlighted as {{a risk factor}} for <b>suicidal</b> <b>and</b> self-harming behaviour in young people, but synthesis of the evidence is lacking.   Methods: A systematic review of 86 relevant papers was conducted.   Results: Considerable published evidence was obtained for positive associations between young people’s <b>suicidal</b> <b>and</b> self-harming behaviour and that of people they know, with those reporting knowing people who had engaged in suicidal or self-harming behaviours more likely to report engaging in similar behaviours themselves.   Conclusion: Findings are discussed in relation to a number of methodological and measurement issues – including the role of normative perceptions – and implications for the prevention of <b>suicidal</b> <b>and</b> self-harming behaviour are considered...|$|R

40|$|Background: Suicide {{mortality}} rates are increasing among teenagers. Aim: To study the prevalence and predictive factors of suicide attempts among Chilean adolescents. Material and Methods: A {{random sample of}} 195 teenagers aged 16 ± 1 years (53 % males) answered an anonymous survey about their demographic features, substance abuse, the Osaka suicidal ideation questionnaire, Smilksten familial Apgar. Beck hopelessness scale, Beck depression scale and Coppersmith self-esteem inventory. Results: Twenty five percent of respondents had attempted suicide at least in one occasion during their lives. These attempts {{were significantly associated with}} female gender, absent parents, family dysfunction, drug abuse, smoking, low self-esteem, hopelessness, depression <b>and</b> recent <b>suicidal</b> ideation. A logistic regression analysis accepted female gender, smoking <b>and</b> recent <b>suicidal</b> ideation as significant independent predictors of suicide attempt. Conclusions: Suicide attempted is common among teenagers and its predictors are female sex, smoking <b>and</b> previous <b>suicidal</b> ideation...|$|R

25|$|Bishop {{had left}} a suicide note {{crediting}} Osama bin Laden for the September 11 attacks and praising it as a justified response to actions against the Palestinians and Iraqis, and said he (Bishop) was {{acting on behalf of}} Al Qaeda, from whom he'd turned down help. As officials could find no evidence of any connections, terrorism as a motive was ruled out, and they suggested that the crash was an apparent suicide.

25|$|Along {{with his}} {{worsening}} alcoholism, the 1963 Profumo Affair, his mother's death in 1964, and the sudden {{death of his}} half-brother Viscount William Waldorf Astor II in March 1966 may have increased his depression. After years of struggling with depression <b>and</b> <b>suicidal</b> ideation, Bobby Shaw committed suicide on July 10, 1970. He is buried in the chapel at Cliveden. John Singer Sargent painted an oil portrait of Nancy Viscountess Astor in 1909, and also did a 1923 charcoal portrait of RGS III in his military uniform. Nancy gave the portrait to Alfred Edward Goodey, art collector and RGS III's partner. It was sold in England in 2011 for £23,000.|$|E
