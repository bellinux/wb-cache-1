5|$|Aronofsky {{conceived}} the premise by connecting his viewings of {{a production of}} Swan Lake with an unrealized screenplay about understudies <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of being haunted by a double, similar to the folklore surrounding doppelgängers. Aronofsky cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Double as another inspiration for the film. The director also considered Black Swan a companion piece to his 2008 film The Wrestler, with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art. He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000, and after a brief attachment to Universal Studios, Black Swan was produced in New York City in 2009 by Fox Searchlight Pictures. Portman and Kunis trained in ballet for several months prior to filming, and notable figures from the ballet world helped with film production to shape the ballet presentation.|$|E
5|$|The {{arguments}} {{made in the}} Resolutions and the Report {{were later}} used frequently during the nullification crisis of 1832, when South Carolina declared federal tariffs to be unconstitutional and void within the state. Madison rejected the concept of nullification <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that his arguments supported such a practice. Whether Madison's theory of Republicanism really supported the nullification movement, and more broadly whether the ideas he expressed between 1798 and 1800 are consistent with his work before and after this period, are the main questions surrounding the Report in the modern literature.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Henry Dion {{appears to be}} a composite of several real life serial killers. His fondness for conversing with his victims' bodies and the gregarious demeanour shown during this seems to be based on Milwaukee-based murderer Jeffrey Dahmer, who would also, like Dion, document his victims photographically. The habit of photographing victims, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of killing women to use them as props, stems from killer Henri Nadeau, who murdered several women in order to use them as mannequins for his photography. The use of an overbearing matriarchal figure as a stressor harkens to Edmund Kemper, who was driven to kill young women by his hatred of his mother, who he eventually murdered before turning himself in; both Dion and Kemper cut their mother's vocal folds from their throats after killing them.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} prince, Augustus also gave Phraates IV an Italian slave-girl, {{who later became}} Queen Musa of Parthia. To ensure that her child Phraataces would inherit the throne without incident, Musa {{convinced}} Phraates IV to give his other sons to Augustus as hostages. Again, Augustus used this as propaganda depicting the submission of Parthia to Rome, listing it as a great accomplishment in his Res Gestae Divi Augusti. When Phraataces took the throne as Phraates V (r. c.2BC – 4AD), Musa married her own son and ruled alongside him. The Parthian nobility, disapproving of both the incestuous relationship <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of a king with non-Arsacid blood, forced the pair into exile in Roman territory. Phraates' successor Orodes III of Parthia lasted just two years on the throne, and was followed by Vonones I, who had adopted many Roman mannerisms during time in Rome. The Parthian nobility, angered by Vonones' sympathies for the Romans, backed a rival claimant, Artabanus III of Parthia (r. c.10–38AD), who eventually defeated Vonones and drove him into exile in Roman Syria.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{his wife}} Badia'a died and al-Hajj Muhammad {{was left with}} his four sons. With the killing of Izz al-Din al-Qassam, a Muslim revivalist preacher and anti-colonial militant by British forces, {{tensions}} between the Palestinian Arab population, among whom al-Qassam was popular, and the authorities rose significantly. His sympathizers grew in number <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of armed struggle against British rule and British sponsorship of Zionism became increasingly popular {{as an alternative to}} the diplomatic negotiations between the Palestinian leadership and the British government. The negotiations were ultimately seen by the local population as a futile effort that bore no tangible results. When al-Hajj Muhammad actively took part in the upcoming revolt, he entrusted his children with his sister Halima, a widow. According to his eldest son Kamal, she too was a grain merchant, who later traded in textiles. She also financially supported the children's education. Al-Hajj Muhammad would normally meet with his sons for one or two days in different villages. His children would be escorted to his location by one of al-Hajj Muhammad's rebels.|$|E
5|$|The axiomatization of mathematics, on {{the model}} of Euclid's Elements, had reached new levels of rigour and breadth {{at the end of the}} 19th century, {{particularly}} in arithmetic, thanks to the axiom schema of Richard Dedekind and Charles Sanders Peirce, and in geometry, thanks to Hilbert's axioms. But at the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell's paradox (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves). The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics, but they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the axiom of foundation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of class.|$|E
