This causes the photo-resist layer which is exposed to the <b>actinic</b> <b>radiation</b> to polymerize and harden, thus producing a latent negative image of the desired circuitry in the photo-resist layer. The unexposed areas of the photo-resist layer which have not been exposed to <b>actinic</b> <b>radiation</b> are then removed using mildly aqueous alkali to expose the copper surface, and this is then removed by chemical etching, thus resulting in a dielectric substrate containing the required copper circuitry covered by polymerized photo-resist.

50|$|Ozone is {{produced}} by short wavelength (110 nm - 220 nm) UV photolysis of oxygen in the upper atmosphere. The photochemical reaction of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons from automobile exhausts is another source. Ozone plays a dual role in weathering. The concentrated layer in the upper atmosphere absorbs the short wavelength (≤300 nm) ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun and thus plays {{a critical role in}} protecting terrestrial objects from this <b>actinic</b> <b>radiation.</b> Ozone is also a powerful oxidant and reported to react rapidly with elastomers and other unsaturated polymers. Ozonolysis typically results in stiffening and cracking, particularly under mechanical stress. However, the contribution of ozonolysis reactions to the overall photooxidation process is still subject to controversy.|$|E
40|$|A {{postulated}} {{capability of}} riboflavin and flavin mononucleotide to protect DNA from damage by far-ultraviolet irradiation {{was investigated in}} purified reaction mixtures and in cultured mammalian cells. Purified calf thymus DNA, admixed with flavin at approximately physiological ratios, was protected from undergoing irradiation-induced changes in spectral absorbance and viscosity compatible with those accompanying pyrimidine dimerization. Irradiation-induced changes in unprotected DNA were reversed by a subsequent treatment of the DNA with flavin {{in the presence of}} visible light. There was no apparent interaction between flavin and non-irradiated DNA. These results suggest that photoexcited flavin interacts directly with the ultraviolet photoproduct in DNA and does not function simply as an energy sink to dissipate photons absorbed by DNA. Cultured embryonic hamster cells were protected from ultraviolet-induced inhibition of growth by a preliminary exposure to relatively large amounts of flavin. This effect was not due to a vitamin- like promotion of cell growth by the flavin. The observation that flavin concentrated transiently in the cytoplasm of exponentially growing hamster cells during a 6 hr incubation period suggested that a shielding action may cooperate with the protective photochemical mechanism in vivo. It was concluded that flavins may function physiologically to protect the genetic material of tissues exposed to <b>actinic</b> <b>radiations,</b> and that when flavin levels in these tissues are inadequate, either because of nutritional deficiency or excessive intensity of irradiation, the damage which results may provide one pathogenetic avenue for the characteristic integumentary lesions of riboflavin deficiency disease...|$|R

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAH) are {{a class of}} common environmental contaminants known to be phototoxic. PAH Photoinduced toxicity is caused by two mechanisms: photomodification and photosensitization. The photomodification process results in modified PAHs, usually via oxygenation, forming new compounds (oxyPAHs), which are often more soluble than their parent PAHs. The process of photosensitization usually leads {{to the production of}} singlet oxygen, a reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn is extremely damaging to organic molecules. Both of these processes occur at environmentally relevant levels of <b>actinic</b> <b>radiation.</b> Metals are ubiquitous environmental contaminants found extensively in many aquatic systems. Many metals are toxic at very low levels, and exhibit toxicity via ROS production or via direct binding to a ligand in an organism (Biotic Ligand Model). PAHs and metals often occur as co-contaminants in the environment, and there combined effects have only been examined in a few organisms. 	The goal of this thesis was to examine the toxicity of PAHs, oxyPAHs, metals and their mixtures to Hyalella azteca in 96 h acute toxicity tests. All of the tests were performed under varying spectra of light; photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), PAR + UVA or simulated solar radiation (SSR) (PAR + UVA radiation + UVB radiation). In addition, chemical exposures in the Dark were performed to assess toxicity in the absence of light. The PAHs chosen represent 3 of the most common PAHs anthracene (ANT), phenanthrene (PHE), benzo(a) anthracene (BAA). The 12 oxyPAHs studied were quinolated analogues of the 3 parent compounds as well as anthraquinone derivatives that are hydroxylated at various positions. The toxicity of the parent PAHs increased in the presence of increasing amounts of <b>actinic</b> <b>radiation.</b> The toxicity of the oxyPAHs also increased as PAR, UVA and UVB was added. Furthermore, most PAHs and oxyPAHs were found to be more toxic than the parent PAHs in the absence of <b>actinic</b> <b>radiation.</b> 	The metals cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) were used in toxicity tests. These metals were selected based on their high prevalence in aquatic environments and the large amount of data in the published work. The order of metal toxicity in the Dark was Cd > Cu > Zn > Ni. The order of metal toxicity for the PAR and PAR/UV-A regime was Cd = Cu > Ni > Zn. The order of metal toxicity for the SSR treatment was Cu > Cd > Ni > Zn. 	The toxicity of several metal/PAH mixtures was determined using one of the four metals and ANT, ATQ and 1 -hATQ. The mixtures generally had additive toxicity under Dark and PAR lighting regimes. Under SSR lighting most mixtures showed a strictly additive toxicity, however synergistic toxicity was observed for the redox active metals (Cu, Ni) mixed with ANT. In the aquatic environment complex mixtures of PAHs and metals occur. The results of this study illustrate the effects that these mixtures may have on benthic invertebrates...|$|E
40|$|Field {{observations}} and three-dimensional (3 D) radiative transfer (RT) simulations of the actinic flux density show strongly pronounced local {{variations in the}} presence of inhomogeneous cloud fields which depend on the spatial distribution of the clouds and their optical properties. While exact three-dimensional RT models like, for example, Monte-Carlo techniques or the Spherical Harmonics Discrete Ordinate Method (SHDOM), despite their large computational burden are fully capable of resolving the observed 3 D structures of the <b>actinic</b> <b>radiation</b> field, the often employed independent pixel approximation (IPA) for RT can not treat this situation realistically. For inhomogeneous 3 D optical property fields of clouds this lack of horizontal photon transport may lead to significant local errors with up to 30 % in the present study. Therefore, a very fast method was developed which realistically reproduces the <b>actinic</b> <b>radiation</b> field for 3 D cloud fields having moderate spatial variability. This method employs a combination of the IPA, including an exact 3 D treatment of the direct sunlight, and a Gaussian point spread function (PSF) to mimic the smoothing properties caused by 3 D diffuse radiative transport. As a post-processing step the effect of horizontal photon transport is approximated by means of a Gaussian smoothing filter which accounts for characteristic optical properties of the medium under consideration. Compared to exact 3 D RT simulations, the new method delivers more realistic results than the pure IPA approach in all cases analysed. Local deviations of the actinic flux density from 3 D RT simulations are significantly reduced in comparison to IPA RT simulations. Depending on the inhomogeneity of the treated cloud fields, the computing time is reduced by a factor of about 20 relative to a full 3 D RT simulation. Due to the employment of the IPA in which the RT is handled independently in each column, the size of the simulated model domain is practically unlimited. We also illustrate how this method can improve IPA RT simulations over orographically structured terrain...|$|E

40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} {{is the key}} factor driving tropospheric photochemistry. It is strongly modulated by clouds and aerosols. A quantitative understanding of the radiation field {{and its effect on}} photochemistry is thus only possible with a detailed knowledge of the interaction between clouds and radiation. The overall objective of the project INSPECTRO was the characterization of the three-dimensional <b>actinic</b> <b>radiation</b> field under cloudy conditions. This was achieved during two measurement campaigns in Norfolk (East Anglia, UK) and Lower Bavaria (Germany) combining space-based, aircraft and ground-based measurements as well as simulations with the one-dimensional radiation transfer model UVSPEC and the three-dimensional radiation transfer model MYSTIC. During both campaigns the spectral actinic flux density was measured at several locations at ground level and in the air by up to four different aircraft. This allows the comparison of measured and simulated <b>actinic</b> <b>radiation</b> profiles. In addition satellite data were used to complete the information of the three dimensional input data set for the simulation. A three-dimensional simulation of actinic flux density data under cloudy sky conditions requires a realistic simulation of the cloud field to be used as an input for the 3 -D radiation transfer model calculations. Two different approaches were applied, to derive high- and low-resolution data sets, with a grid resolution of about 100 m and 1 km, respectively. The results of the measured and simulated radiation profiles as well as the results of the ground based measurements are presented in terms of photolysis rate profiles for ozone and nitrogen dioxide.

40|$|An {{airborne}} system for fast measurements of spectral actinic flux densities in the wavelength range 305 - 700 nm is introduced.

The new radiometer promotes high accuracy in measuring of biologically relevant UV radiation at work places. The handy construction and accuracy recommend it for field investigations of UV burdened work places. Using that compact instrument, representative UV-burdened work places in industries and medical institutions were investigated. Using our data, recommendations are possible for design and correction of such work places. The committee 'Strahlenkunde' of German Buero of Standardization (DIN) has endorsed the results of this project and accepted a first proposal for a new DIN Standard 'Radiometer for measurement of <b>actinic</b> <b>radiation</b> data'. The results have been published and discussed with further responsible committees (Strahlenschutzkommission und Berufsgenossenschaft Feinmechanik und Elektrotechnik). (orig.)

40|$|Photochemical {{reactions}} {{represent the}} main pathway {{for the removal}} of non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere. VOCs may react with hydroxyl radical (OH), the most important atmospheric oxidant, or they can be photolyzed by <b>actinic</b> <b>radiation.</b> In the presence of clouds and fog, VOCs may partition into the aqueous phase where they can undergo aqueous photolysis and/or reaction with dissolved OH. The significance of direct aqueous photolysis is largely uncertain {{due to the lack of}} published absorption cross sections and photolysis quantum yields. In light of this, we strive to identify atmospherically relevant VOCs where removal by aqueous photolysis may be a significant sink. The relative importance of different photochemical sinks is assessed by calculating the ratios of the removal rates inside air parcels containing cloud and fog droplets. This relative approach provides useful information in spite of the limited aqueous photolysis data. Results of this work should help guide researchers in identifying molecules that are the most likely to undergo aqueous OH oxidation and photolysis. For example, we find that out of the 27 atmospherically relevant species investigated, the removal of glyceraldehyde and pyruvic acid by aqueous photolysis is potentially an important sink. We also determine the relative magnitudes of these four chemical sinks for the set of relevant organic compounds...|$|E
