5|$|After 18 to 24 {{months of}} development, Maniac Mansion debuted at the 1987 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was {{released}} for the Commodore 64 <b>and</b> <b>Apple</b> II in October 1987. While previous Lucasfilm Games products {{had been published}} by outside companies, Maniac Mansion was self-published. This became a trend at Lucasfilm. The company hired Ken Macklin, an acquaintance of Winnick's, to design the game's packaging artwork. Gilbert and Winnick collaborated with the marketing department to design the back cover. The two also created an insert that includes hints, a backstory, and jokes. An MS-DOS port was released in early 1988, developed in part by Lucasfilm employees Aric Wilmunder and Brad Taylor. Ports for the Amiga, Atari ST and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) followed, with the Amiga and Atari ST ports in 1989 and the NES port in 1990. The 16-bit versions of Maniac Mansion featured a copy protection system requiring the user to enter graphical symbols out of a code book include with the game. This was not present in the Commodore 64 <b>and</b> <b>Apple</b> versions {{due to lack of}} disk space, so those instead used an on-disk copy protection.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Cisco Systems <b>and</b> <b>Apple</b> {{negotiated}} over allowing Apple {{rights to}} use Cisco's Linksys iPhone trademark, but the negotiations stalled when Cisco {{pushed for the}} two products to be interoperable. Following the public unveiling of the Apple iPhone at the 2007 Macworld Expo, Cisco {{filed a lawsuit against}} Apple in January 2007, alleging Apple's iPhone name infringed on Cisco's iPhone trademark. Cisco alleged that Apple created a front company subsequent to their negotiations to try to acquire the rights another way, while Apple countered {{that there would be no}} likelihood of confusion between the two products, because Apple's iPhone product was the first cell phone with such a name, while Cisco's iPhone was a VoIP phone. Bloomberg reported Cisco's iPhone as a product marketed for less than $100 and part of the Linksys home routers, enabling internet-based calls through Skype and Yahoo! Messenger, and contrasted it with Apple's iPhone as a mobile phone which sold for around $600. In February 2007, Cisco <b>and</b> <b>Apple</b> announced an agreement under which both companies would be allowed to use the iPhone name worldwide.|$|E

5|$|In {{the year}} before Apple and Samsung began suing each other on most continents, and while Apple and HTC were already embroiled in a patent fight, Motorola Mobility <b>and</b> <b>Apple</b> started a period of intense patent litigation. The Motorola-Apple patent imbroglio {{commenced}} with claims and cross-claims between the companies for patent infringement and encompassed multiple forums in multiple countries as each party sought friendly venues for litigating its respective claims; the fight also included administrative law rulings as well as ITC and European Commission involvement. As of April 2012, the controversy centered on whether a FRAND license to a components manufacturer carries over to an equipment manufacturer incorporating the component into equipment, an issue not addressed in the U.S. Supreme Court's default exhaustion doctrine in Quanta v. LG Electronics. p. 3. Accessed 2012-4-13. Stern cites , 128 S. Ct. 2109, 2008; accessed 2012-4-13.
