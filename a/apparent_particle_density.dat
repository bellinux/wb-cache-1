40|$|Purpose: A multiparticular floating-pulsatile drug {{delivery}} system was developed for time and site specific drug release of piroxicam. A blend of floating and pulsatile principles of {{drug delivery}} system would have the advantage that a drug can be released in the upper GI tract after a definite time period. Methods: Hollow microspheres were prepared by the emulsion solvent diffusion method using Eudragit S as an enteric acrylic polymer with piroxicam at various polymer/drug ratios {{in a mixture of}} dichloromethane and ethanol. Developed formulations were evaluated for yield, encapsulation efficiency, particle size, shape, apparent density, buoyancy studies and dissolution studies. Results: The obtained microballoons were spherical with no major surface irregularity and mean particle size ranging from 250 to 380 for different batches. Formulations show a slight amount of relaese ranging from 0. 7 to 11 % in acidic medium (SGF) with complete release of drug in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) in less than 3 h. Encapsulation efficiency of different formulations varied from 90 to 98 %. The optimum loading amount of drug in the particles was found to impart suitable floatable properties to the microballoons. With increasing polymer/drug ratio, buancy of the microballoons increases accompanied by simultaneous reduction of <b>apparent</b> <b>particle</b> <b>density.</b> Conclusion: A pulsatile release of piroxicam was demonstrated by a simple {{drug delivery system}} which could be useful in chronopharmacotherapy of rheumatoid arthritis...|$|E
40|$|Water {{absorption}} and {{frost heaving}} of aggregates {{have a strong}} influence {{on the performance of}} a highway pavement. This is because several mechanical properties of aggregates change in direct response to water ingress and ground freezing. Recycled aggregates of different types are increasingly being used in pavements; however, their frost heaving and water absorption potential has not been fully investigated and documented. In the present study the opportunity was taken to study the water absorption and freeze–thaw properties of three different aggregates: (i) 100 % recycled concrete aggregate, (ii) 100 % natural aggregate from limestone rock, and (iii) 50 % recycled concrete aggregate[*]+[*] 50 % reclaimed asphalt pavement. For different particle size ranges, extensive tests were carried out for each of the above materials ((i) –(iii)) using the pyknometer and wire basket methods as well as simulation in a self-refrigerated unit. The following three kinds of density were measured: (a) over-dry, (b) saturated and surface dry, and (c) <b>apparent</b> <b>particle</b> <b>density.</b> The 100 % natural aggregate had the lowest water absorption and highest densities ((a) –(c)) whereas the 100 % recycled concrete aggregate had the highest water absorption. In contrast to the above findings, the frost heave potential was found to be much less sensitive to the aggregate type and particle size. Water absorption of recycled concrete aggregate decreased with increasing mean particle size. The measured relationships between density, grading and water absorption led to increased understanding of the behaviour of materials containing different fractions of recycled concrete aggregate and reclaimed asphalt pavement...|$|E
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of waste legislation, {{in the form of}} regulations and directives, {{in many parts of the}} world a significant move towards sustainable waste management is becoming a legal requirement. Emphasis is now being placed on increasing recycling and promoting more sustainable practices for waste materials, including glass. The present research, therefore, aimed at examining the feasibility of Foamed Glass Gravel (FGG) as construction material, in particular Geofil Foamed Glass Gravél (GFGG), a manufactured lightweight secondary aggregate, for use as a primary aggregate substitute in concrete production. Comparison is made at all times with other FGG material, namely Hasopor, and other lightweight by-product manufactured material namely Lytag. In the main, research was carried out in three distinct parts; Part 1 examining the key characteristics of GFGG (following relevant BS and BS EN standards), Part 2 assessing its suitability for use in concrete applications, and Part 3 providing practical implications of the findings. The programme of work was designed to establish benchmarking level for coarse and fine GFGG and to provide simple practical guidelines for its use in concrete. The research has identified some of the key practical and application issues for utilising GGFG in concrete. The physical characteristics of GFGG were found to be comparable, and in some cases superior, to those obtained for currently available manufactured lightweight secondary aggregates. The grading of GFGG was found to be almost within the limits of lightweight aggregates with similar voids ratio as that of NA. Typically, GFGG, rough in it's texture, could create better mechanical interlocking with cement paste than smooth aggregates. GFGG had 60 - 65 % lower bulk density, 40 - 50 % lower <b>apparent</b> <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> and water absorption 3 to 5 times higher than natural Thames Valley Gravel but still performed comparable to other lightweight aggregates. However it was found to have slightly higher density than Hasopor, but also higher heat and crushing resistance. Overall, characterisation test results showed that GFGG has a potential for use as quality lightweight aggregate in concrete production. However, it was noted that the precautions may be necessary to take account of bubble densities and water absorption characteristics to guarantee suitable fresh properties of concrete. In order to determine the practical upper limit of GFGG content for a range of applications and to assess the performance of GFGG concrete, mixes were proportioned using Natural Aggregate (NA) and GFGG bubbles blends with up to 60 % coarse or 15 % fine bubbles- by volume. The general trends observed indicate comparable workability with inclusion of GFGG in concrete mixes and slump loss with time was not adversely affected. Results of compressive strength testing showed that up to 30 % coarse or 15 % fine GFGG had negligible effect on the cube and cylinder strength of concrete and using up to 15 % fine GFGG caused a slight increase in cube, cylinder and other engineering properties. Moreover, within 3 -days 30 % coarse GFGG and (5 - 15 %) fíne GFGG concrete mixes achieved on average 73 % of 28 -day compressive strength. This increased to 85 % within 7 days, regardless of GFGG content when compared to NA (Control) concrete mixes. However, results show gradual reduction in strength with an increase in GFGG content beyond 30 % coarse in the mix. Indeed, the results showed that such reduction in strength with high GFGG proportions can be compensated for by adjusting the mix water/cement ratio. The results also showed that the original glass source had a negligible effect on fresh and key bulk engineering properties of resulting concrete. The subject of GFGG concrete durability study included initial surface absorption, carbonation rates and alkali-silica reaction testing. In general, GFGG concrete mixes were found to posses near surface absorption properties similar to the corresponding NA concrete mixes, providing GFGG content was restricted to 30 % coarse or 15 % fme. Carbonation rates for up to 60 % GFGG mixes were comparable to NA mixes. Results of accelerated ASR testing of 30 - 100 % fine GFGG mortar prisms indicated that none of the tested samples expanded significantly during the test and that damaging deleterious expansion due to ASR did not occurred during testing. The practical implications of the study to the construction industry are also discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
