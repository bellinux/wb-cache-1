50|$|Immediate {{cleansing}} of wounds {{caused by}} canines and felines {{can be successful}} in keeping C. canimorsus infections at bay. Irrigation of wounds with saline is recommended and individuals are encouraged to seek medical help for the administration of antibiotics. Antibiotics are recommended if wounds are deep or individuals prolong seeking medical attention. Antibiotics that contain beta-lactamase inhibitors (i.e., oral <b>Augmentin</b> or parenteral Unasyn) cover C. canimorsus {{as well as other}} organisms common in bites.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} of a β-lactamase by a bacterium does not necessarily rule out all treatment options with β-lactam antibiotics. In some instances, β-lactam antibiotics may be co-administered with a β-lactamase inhibitor. For example, <b>Augmentin</b> (FGP) is made of amoxicillin (a β-lactam antibiotic) and clavulanic acid (a β-lactamase inhibitor). The clavulanic acid is designed to overwhelm all β-lactamase enzymes, and effectively serve as an antagonist so that the amoxicillin is not affected by the β-lactamase enzymes.|$|E
50|$|The high {{frequency}} of strains producing beta-lactamase limit {{the use of}} single beta-lactam antibiotics as first-line treatment, which underlies the need to test the in vitro susceptibility of clinical isolates. Many antimicrobial treatments were used {{despite a lack of}} randomized trials and guidelines relating to the duration of treatment according to infected sites. The imipenem/cilastatin, clindamycin or combinations containing an inhibitor of beta-lactamases (i.e. <b>Augmentin,</b> Unasyn) are always effective and their use can be recommended (Jolivet-Gougeon et al. 2007; Piau et al. 2013). For Capnocytophagia canimorus the drug of choice is penicillin G, given with or without a beta-lactamase inhibitor depending on resistance.|$|E

40|$|<b>Augmentin</b> (Beecham Laboratories, Bristol, Tenn.), a {{combination}} drug {{consisting of two}} parts amoxicillin to one part clavulanic acid and a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated in vitro in comparison with ampicillin or amoxicillin or both for its inhibitory and bactericidal activities against selected clinical isolates. Regression analysis was performed and tentative disk diffusion susceptibility breakpoints were determined. A multicenter performance study of the disk diffusion test was conducted with three quality control organisms to determine tentative quality control limits. All methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to <b>Augmentin,</b> although the minimal inhibitory concentrations for beta-lactamase-producing strains of both groups were, on the average, fourfold higher than those for enzyme-negative strains. Among the Enterobacteriaceae, <b>Augmentin</b> exhibited significantly greater activity than did ampicillin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus vulgaris, and {{about one-third of the}} Escherichia coli strains tested. Bactericidal activity usually occurred at the minimal inhibitory concentration. There was a slight inoculum concentration effect on the <b>Augmentin</b> minimal inhibitory concentrations. On the basis of regression and error rate-bounded analyses, the suggested interpretive disk diffusion susceptibility breakpoints for <b>Augmentin</b> are: susceptible, {{greater than or equal to}} 18 mm; resistant, less than or equal to 13 mm (gram-negative bacilli); and susceptible, greater than or equal to 20 mm (staphylococci and H. influenzae).

40|$|Alcohol {{dependence}} {{is associated}} with alteration of glutamate transport and glutamate neurotransmission. Glutamate transporter 1 (GLT- 1) is a major transporter that regulates the majority of extracellular glutamate concentration, which is also regulated by cystine-glutamate exchanger (xCT). Importantly, we recently reported that amoxicillin and <b>Augmentin</b> (amoxicillin/clavulanate) upreglulated GLT- 1 expression in nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as reduced ethanol consumption in male P rats. In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} amoxicillin and <b>Augmentin</b> on GLT- 1 isoforms (GLT- 1 a and GLT- 1 b), xCT and glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) expression in NAc and PFC as well as ethanol intake in male P rats. We found that both compounds significantly reduced ethanol intake, and increased GLT- 1 a, GLT- 1 b and xCT expression in NAc. However, only <b>Augmentin</b> increased GLT- 1 a, GLT- 1 b and xCT expression in PFC. There were no effects of these compounds on GLAST expression in NAc and PFC. These findings demonstrated that <b>Augmentin</b> and amoxicillin have the potential to upregulate GLT- 1 isoforms and xCT expression, and consequently attenuate ethanol dependence...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of a syrup formulation {{consisting of}} four parts of amoxycillin and {{one part of}} potassium clavulanate (<b>Augmentin)</b> were studied in 11 paediatric patients, 3 to 14 years of age.

Cure rates for infections caused by penicillinase (beta lactamase) producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) were 87 % (20 / 23) for regimen 1, 97 % (28 / 29) for regimen 2, and 95 % (19 / 20) for regimen 3. Thus {{the addition of}} one or two tablets of <b>Augmentin</b> 375 mg to aqueous procaine penicillin G and probenecid cured 96 % (47 / 49) of infections caused by PPNG strains.

40|$|Background and objective:] Inappropriate use of {{antibiotics}} {{appears to be an}} increasing problem with important consequences on both antibiotic resistance and hospital costs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the appropriateness of prescription of the intravenous combination amoxicillin/clavulanate (<b>Augmentin).</b> [Design:] Prospective, observational study. [Setting:] All the wards in a teaching hospital in Belgium were included, except paediatric and intensive care units. All patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic intravenous <b>Augmentin</b> 1 g/ 100 mg or 2 g/ 200 mg between 23 March 2009 and 24 April 2009 were enrolled. Data were collected by a pharmacist and the appropriateness of antibiotic treatment was analysed in collaboration with an infectious diseases specialist according to local recommendations. [Main outcome measures:] Appropriateness of indication, dosage, iv-to-oral switch and duration of therapy. [Results:] One hundred and six patients were evaluated. The most common indications for amoxicillin/clavulanate prescribing were: respiratory tract infections (38 %), surgical/interventional prophylaxis (28 %) and intra-abdominal infections (11 %). Overall, 43. 4 % of intravenous <b>Augmentin</b> prescriptions were fully appropriate and 56. 6 % of prescriptions had at least one inappropriate criterion. Indication for use was appropriate in 80. 2 % and dosage in 73. 8 % of cases. In contrast, the timing of iv-to-oral switch and duration of therapy were inappropriate in 64. 4 and 52. 9 % of cases, respectively. [Conclusions:] This study identified two main areas for improving <b>Augmentin</b> prescribing: (1) the iv-to-oral switch, which is often too late or nonexistent and (2) the duration of therapy, which is too long particularly in respiratory tract infections. The results will be presented to clinicians to increase their awareness on this issue. The final aim is that the Pharmacy department implements specific interventions to optimize <b>Augmentin</b> prescribing...|$|E
