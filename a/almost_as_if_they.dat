Historians have come to see the Sui Generis farewell concerts as the end of the 'Classic' Argentine rock era. Acoustic rock was passing into history: bands dissolved, changed their sound, and those that remained lost popularity and became only cult followings. Argentine progressive rock was on the rise, and so was the political repression to freedoms of expression. Also, several bands would leave the country for greener pastures in Europe, mostly Spain, among them Moris and Aquelarre.|$|E

Because not all children develop in the same manner or at the same rate, it may be some years before A-T is properly diagnosed. Most children with A-T have stable neurologic symptoms for the first 4–5 years of life, but begin to show increasing problems in early school years.|$|E

2500|$|Florida {{was mostly}} divided between two {{distinct}} culture groups, the Muskogean & the Carib. While {{there were some}} Muskogean tribes along almost the entirety of Florida's east coast, everything else south of Lake Okeechobee was ruled by a Carib nation called the Calusa —Including the Keys. This tribe {{appears to have been}} a powerful trading force in the Caribbean & the chief & his wife were treated <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were a king & queen. They had discovered complex building techniques & built cities of two story communal buildings, as space within the Everglades was scarce. Smaller farming & fishing villages built the more common thatched-roof, stilted huts common amongst the Carib peoples. While they mostly wove their clothing from Spanish moss & made shawls & rugs from dried palm leaves, they also undoubtedly traded for other cloth goods to the north and west, which may have given them access to Hemp [...] & Cotton. The Chief & his wife had their own palace, of sorts, in which they lived & from which they conducted their political business. They were met with the Spanish when they attempted to explore Florida in the 16th century & continued to survive in the region until the mid-18th century, when Spain temporarily lost control of the Florida colony to the English due to the activities of the Creek Confederacy. They were also partially responsible for the mythology surrounding the Fountain of Youth. Later, they conquered some of the other Muskogean peoples—namely the Ais & the Mayaimi [...] (for which the city of Miami is named for, despite the fact that the tribe surrounded Lake Okeechobee), technically making them an Empire, as small as they were. (An Empire is seen as a governing system in which significant populations of different kinds of people with separate cultural identities are ruled over by a single, ultimate ruler).|$|E

Now, having shifted over 500,000 copies of debut disc Uncle B and reached No.1 alongside Tinchy Stryder, the Camden trio are aiming to become leaders of the Brrap pack with second album Against All Odds. Reflecting their move up pop's pecking order, this trailer single is their biggest, most bombastic moment yet. It's got hawkish sirens and loads of clubby synths - evidently inspired by Fraser T Smith's production on the Tinchy album - but N-Dubz haven't lost their usual quirky charm, dropping in oh-so-relevant references to Facebook and LBDs (that's [...] "little black dress", fellas). With an appeal that extends far beyond the back of the bus, 'I Need You' is – to borrow a word from the inimitable Dappy - probably best described as a [...] "smasher"." [...] Sarah-Louise James of the Daily Star reviewed the single as: [...] "British hip-house at its fizziest." [...] Alt-Uk.net reviewed the track: [...] "I Need You is an absolute fun-packed single from N-Dubz, and whilst listening to this one it really is difficult not to start singing along. N-Dubz once again demonstrates here a great knack for penning a perfect pop song, and this group certainly seems to know what it's doing when it comes to making the music as infectious as possible." [...] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC Chart Blog also positively reviewed the song, mentioning: [...] "It's this kind of bonkers happenstance which I love.

[...] A simple and conservative sort, Head of State Cemal Gürsel became Turkey's most popular figure, forbade display of his picture alongside Atatürk's in government offices, rode about in an open Jeep touring rural communities, talking to the peasants <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were his children (Time, 6 January 1961). He was successful with his personal interventions in reducing the number of execution verdicts from the Yassıada tribunals from 15 down to three. Gürsel's plea for forgiveness and attempts along with several other world leaders for the reversal of the execution sentences and for the release of Adnan Menderes and two other ministers were rejected by the Junta. A member of the National Unity Committee writes in his memoirs that, upon Cemal Gürsel's intervention on the prevention of Menderes' execution, the chief prosecutor of the tribunal, Altay Ömer Egesel, said: ‘Let us hurry! They will save him (Menderes)!’, also arranging a contingency plan for conducting the execution in a Navy Destroyer {{in the event of a}} forgiveness operation in Imrali Island to save Menderes while, at the same time, placing a press release questioning the legal ability of Gürsel for an intervention. Senator Mehmet Feyyat, District Attorney of Istanbul at the time, recently declared: ‘They cut off our phone lines. Adnan Menderes was hanged against the regulations. I was supposed to oversee the execution. The revolution tribunal's chief prosecutor Egesel conducted the execution despite not being authorized. İsmet İnönü and Cemal Gürsel were already phoning for him (Menderes) not to be executed but the telecommunications' office cut off the lines and Egesel made use of the (communication) gap to conduct the execution.’Cemal Gürsel resisted pressure to continue military rule, was wounded as a result of a military assassination attempt on his life (forgave the colonel who shot him), thwarted subsequent multiple military coup attempts, appointed the organizers of the coup to overseas posts and played an important role in the preparation of a new constitution and return to the democratic order of the Kemalist vision.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} new {{paradigm}} for blind watermark decoding {{in the presence of}} desynchronization attacks. Employing Forney-style factor graphs to model the watermarking system, we cast the blind watermark decoding problem as a probabilistic inference problem on a graph, and solve it via message-passing. We study a wide range of moderate to strong attacks including scaling, amplitude modulation, fractional shift, arbitrary linear and shift-invariant filtering, and blockwise filtering, and show that the graph-based iterative decoders perform <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had exact knowledge of the desynchronization attack parameters. Other desirable features of the graph-based decoders include the flexibility to adapt to other types of attacks and the ability to cope with the “curse of dimensionality ” problem that seemingly results when the desynchronization parameter space has high dimensionality. These properties are unlike most blind watermark decoders proposed to date. Index Terms—Blind watermark decoding, data hiding, desyn-chronization attacks, Forney factor graphs, graphicalmodels, joint estimator-detector, Markov random fields, message passing, quan-tization index modulation (QIM).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a set of}} experimental results produced from the TIPSTER SUMMAC initiative on user directed summaries: document summaries generated {{in the context of}} an information need expressed as a query. The summarizer that was evaluated was based on a set of existing statistical techniques that had been applied successfully to the INQUERY retrieval system. The techniques proved to have a wider utility, however, as the summarizer was one of the better performing systems in the SUMMAC evaluation. The design of this summarizer is presented with a range of evaluations: both those provided by SUMMAC as well as a set of preliminary, more informal, evaluations that examined additional aspects of the summaries. Amongst other conclusions, the results reveal that users can judge the relevance of documents from their summary <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> accurately <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had had access to the document's full text. 1. 1 Keywords User directed summarization, information retrieval, consistency of relevant judgements. 2...|$|R
