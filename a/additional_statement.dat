25|$|In August 2017, the LDS church {{released}} a statement about the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia condemning racism in general. Following the statement, the LDS Church {{released a}}n <b>additional</b> <b>statement,</b> specifically condemning white supremacy as morally wrong. Black Mormon blogger Tami Smith said that she joyfully heard the statement and felt that the church was standing with black church members.|$|E
500|$|On September 4, 2016, {{during a}} game in Chicago against the Red Stars, Rapinoe knelt during the {{national}} anthem in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback who refused to stand during the anthem to protest what he calls racial injustice and minority oppression. She {{said at the time}} she planned to continue to kneel. Later that week on September 7, the Washington Spirit uncharacteristically played the national anthem prior to the teams taking the field, indicating that {{they did not want to}} [...] "subject our fans and friends to the disrespect we feel such an act would represent".

500|$|Planning for the Cycle Center {{was part}} of the larger [...] "Bike 2010 Plan", in which the city aimed to make itself more {{accommodating}} to bicycle commuters. This plan (since replaced by the [...] "Bike 2015 Plan") included provisions for front-mounted two-bike carriers on Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses, permitting bikes to be carried on Chicago 'L' trains, installing numerous bike racks and creating bicycle lanes in streets throughout the city. Additionally, the Chicago metropolitan area's other mass transit providers, Metra and Pace, have developed increased bike accessibility. Mayor Daley was an advocate of the plan, noting it is also an environmentally friendly effort to cut down on traffic. Environmentalists, urban planners and cycling enthusiasts around the world have expressed interest in the Cycle Center, and want to emulate {{what they see as a}} success story in urban planning and transit-oriented development. Pro-cycling and environmentalist journalists in publications well beyond Chicago have described the Cycle Center as exemplary, impressive, unique and ground-breaking. The Toronto Star notes that it is revered as [...] "a kind of Shangri-La", and describes it as [...] "a jewel-like glass building on the Chicago waterfront, [...] has many of the amenities of an upscale health club [...] close to the heart of the city", with the <b>additional</b> <b>statement</b> that [...] "It's not heaven, but it's close". [...] A Vancouver official told The Oregonian that it was [...] "the ultimate in bicycle stations", and would be natural for bicycle friendly cities to emulate.|$|E
50|$|On 22 December 2010, Police arrested Pastor Moses Solomon Male {{and one of}} his lawyers, Henry Ddungu to {{allegedly}} make <b>additional</b> <b>statements.</b> After {{failing to}} secure sanctioning of the charges, they were released.

2500|$|The Council of Conservative Citizens, whose website Roof {{cited as}} a source for his radicalization, issued a {{statement}} on its website [...] "unequivocally condemn" [...] the attack, but that Roof has some [...] "legitimate grievances" [...] against black people.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the fourteen quotations on the Inscription Wall, {{each side of the}} Stone of Hope includes an <b>additional</b> <b>statement</b> attributed to King. The first, from the [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech, is [...] "Out of the Mountain of Despair, a Stone of Hope"—the quotation that serves {{as the basis for the}} monument's design. The words on the other side of the stone used to read, [...] "I Was a Drum Major for Justice, Peace, and Righteousness", which is a paraphrased version of a longer quote by King: [...] "If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter." [...] The memorial's use of the paraphrased version of the quote was criticized, and was removed in August 2013.|$|E
6000|$|Bronzed {{men with}} brooms and buckets {{in their hands}} stood about with open mouths. [...] "I have found them lying in the passage outside the captain's door," [...] the steward {{declared}} faintly. The <b>additional</b> <b>statement</b> that the captain's watch was gone from its hook by the bedside raised the painful sensation to the highest pitch. We knew then we had a thief amongst us. Our thief! Behold the solidarity of a ship's company. He couldn't be to us like any other thief. We all had to live {{under the shadow of}} his crime for days; but the police kept on investigating, and one morning a young woman appeared on board swinging a parasol, attended by two policemen, and identified the culprit. She was a barmaid of some bar near the Circular Quay, and knew really nothing of our man except that he looked like a respectable sailor. She had seen him only twice in her life. On the second occasion he begged her nicely as a great favour to take care for him of a small solidly tied-up paper parcel for a day or two. But he never came near her again. At the end of three weeks she opened it, and, of course, seeing the contents, was much alarmed, and went to the nearest police-station for advice. The police took her at once on board our ship, where all hands were mustered on the quarterdeck. She stared wildly at all our faces, pointed suddenly a finger with a shriek, [...] "That's the man," [...] and incontinently went off into a fit of hysterics in front of thirty-six seamen. I must say that never in my life did I see a ship's company look so frightened. Yes, in this tale of guilt, there was a curious absence of mere criminality, and a touch of that fantasy which is often a part of a seaman's character. It wasn't greed that moved him, I think. It was something much less simple: boredom, perhaps, or a bet, or the pleasure of defiance.|$|E

50|$|A route {{reflector}} is {{a single}} point of failure, therefore (at least) a second route reflector may be configured {{in order to provide}} redundancy.

An additional 11*2-2=20 statements in this case due to adding the additional Router.
