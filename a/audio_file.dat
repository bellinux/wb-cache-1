The tracks were recorded in London, Hamburg, Paris, Berlin, and Las Vegas.|$|E
5|$|Adam Berry, the show's {{original}} score composer, used {{sound synthesis}} to simulate a small orchestra, and frequently alluded to existing famous pieces of music. Berry also used signature acoustic guitar and mandolin cues as leitmotifs for the show's establishing shots. After Berry left in 2001, Jamie Dunlap and Scott Nickoley of the Los Angeles-based Mad City Production Studios provided the show's original {{music for the}} next seven seasons. Since 2008, Dunlap has been credited as the show's sole score composer. Dunlap's contributions to the show {{are one of the few}} that are not achieved at the show's own production offices. Dunlap reads a script, creates a score using digital audio software, and then e-mails the <b>audio</b> <b>file</b> to South Park Studios, where it is edited to fit with the completed episode.|$|E

5|$|The {{late 1990s}} saw an {{increase}} in the free trading of digital bootlegs, sharply decreasing the demand for and profitability of physical bootlegs. The rise of <b>audio</b> <b>file</b> formats such as MP3 and Real Audio, combined with the ability to share files between computers via the internet made it simpler for bootleg collectors to exchange recordings. The arrival of Napster in 1999 made it easy to share bootlegs between a large computer network. Older analog recordings were converted to digital format, tracks from bootleg CDs were ripped to computer hard disks, and new material was created with digital recording of various types, and all of these types could now be easily shared. Instead of album-length collections or live recordings of entire shows, fans often now had the option of searching for and downloading bootlegs of individual songs. Artists gave a mixed reaction to bootleg sharing via the internet; Bob Dylan allowed fans to download archive recordings from his official website, while King Crimson's Robert Fripp and, infamously, Metallica were strongly critical of the ease in which Napster could circumvent the traditional channels of royalty payments.|$|E

40|$|Encryption is a {{technique}} to secure sounds data from attackers. In this study, transposition technique that corresponds to a WAV file extension is used. The performance of the transposition technique is measured using the mean square error (MSE). In the test, the value of MSE of the original and encrypted <b>audio</b> <b>files</b> were compared; the original and decrypted <b>audio</b> <b>files</b> used the correct password is ‘SEMBILAN’ and the incorrect password is ‘DELAPAN’. The experimental {{results showed that the}} original and encrypted <b>audio</b> <b>files,</b> and the original and decrypted <b>audio</b> <b>files</b> used the correct password that has a value of MSE = 0, and with the incorrect one with a value of MSE 0. 00000428 or ≠ 0. In other words, the transposition technique is able to ensure the security of <b>audio</b> data <b>files...</b>|$|R

25|$|Medical {{transcription}} editing is {{the process}} of listening to a voice-recorded file and comparing that to the transcribed report of that <b>audio</b> <b>file,</b> correcting errors as needed. Although speech recognition technology has become better at understanding human language, editing is still needed to ensure better accuracy. Medical transcription editing is also performed on medical reports transcribed by medical transcriptionists.|$|E

25|$|All {{forms of}} DRM for audio and visual {{material}} (excluding interactive materials, e.g., videogames) {{are subject to}} the analog hole, namely that in order for a viewer to play the material, the digital signal must be turned into an analog signal containing light and/or sound for the viewer, and so available to be copied as no DRM is capable of controlling content in this form. In other words, a user could play a purchased <b>audio</b> <b>file</b> while using a separate program to record the sound back into the computer into a DRM-free file format.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{advances}} in speech recognition technology have shifted the job responsibilities of medical transcriptionists from not only transcribing but also editing. Editing {{has always been}} a part of the medical transcriptionist job, however now editing is a larger requirement as reports are more often being transcribed electronically. With different accents, articulations, and pronunciations, speech recognition technology can still have problems deciphering words. This is where the medical transcriptionist editor steps in. Medical transcription editors will compare and correct the transcribed file to the voice-recorded <b>audio</b> <b>file.</b> The job is similar to medical transcription as editing will use a foot pedal and the education and training requirements are mostly the same.|$|E

25|$|The logical {{format of}} an audio CD (officially Compact Disc Digital Audio or CD-DA) is {{described}} in a document produced in 1980 by the format's joint creators, Sony and Philips. The document is known colloquially as the Red Book CD-DA after the colour of its cover. The format is a two-channel 16-bit PCM encoding at a 44.1kHz sampling rate per channel. Four-channel sound was to be an allowable option within the Red Book format, but has never been implemented. Monaural audio has no existing standard on a Red Book CD; thus, mono source material is usually presented as two identical channels in a standard Red Book stereo track (i.e., mirrored mono); an MP3 CD, however, can have <b>audio</b> <b>file</b> formats with mono sound.|$|E
