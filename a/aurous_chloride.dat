40|$|Gold {{nanoparticles}} {{are commonly}} synthesized by reducing chloroauric acid with sodium citrate. This method, {{referred to as}} the citrate method, can produce spherical gold nanoparticles (NPs) in the size range 10 - 150 nm. Gold NPs of this size are useful in many applications. However, the NPs are usually polydisperse and irreproducible. A better understanding of the synthesis mechanisms is thus required. This work thoroughly investigated the only model that describes the synthesis. This model combines mass and population balance equations, describing the NPs synthesis through a sequence of chemical reactions. Chloroauric acid reacts with sodium citrate to form <b>aurous</b> <b>chloride</b> and dicarboxy acetone. The latter organizes <b>aurous</b> <b>chloride</b> in a nucleation step and concurrently degrades into acetone. The unconsumed precursor then grows the formed nuclei. However, depending on the pH, both the precursor and the reducing agent react differently thus affecting the synthesis. In this work, we investigated the model for different conditions of pH, temperature and initial reactant concentrations. To solve the model, we used Parsival, a commercial numerical code, whilst to test it, we considered various conditions studied experimentally by different researchers, for which results are available in the literature. The model poorly predicted the experimental data. We believe that this is because the model does not account for the acid-base properties of both chloroauric acid and sodium citrate...|$|E
40|$|Consideration of the {{geologic}} {{characteristics of}} hydrothermal gold ore deposits suggests that gold-quartz veins are formed from acid solutions containing 0. 001 to '• ' 0. 05 ppm gold. The geologic conclusions agree with thermodynamic calculations of the solubility {{of gold in}} concentrated sodium chloride solutions in equilibrium with pyrite and quartz at high temperatures. The calculations indicate that sufficient gold can be carried in solution as <b>aurous</b> <b>chloride</b> complexes to account for hydrothermal gold ore deposits precipitated above 175 ø C. Cotectic precipitation of gold, pyrite, and quartz accompanies decreasing temperature, but only gold and pyrite are precipitated by an isothermal increase in pH and/or {{a decrease in the}} oxidation state of the system. In-terpretation of the chemical characteristics of gold-quartz veins in terms of the thermo-dynamic requirements for hydrothermal transport and deposition of gold at elevated temperatures constitutes a potential aid to exploration for gold ore deposits...|$|E
