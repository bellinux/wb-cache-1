50|$|In Canadian labour law, the Rand formula (also {{referred}} to as <b>automatic</b> <b>check-off)</b> is a workplace situation where the payment of trade union dues is mandatory regardless of the worker's union status. This formula is designed {{to ensure that no}} employee will opt out of the union simply to avoid dues yet reap the benefits of collective bargaining, such as higher wages or health insurance. Supreme Court of Canada Justice Ivan Rand, the eponym of this law, introduced this formula in 1946 as an arbitration decision ending the Ford Strike of 1945 in Windsor, Ontario. The Canada Labour Code and the labour relations laws of a majority of provinces contain provisions requiring the Rand formula when certain conditions are met. In those provinces where the labour relations laws do not make the Rand formula mandatory, the <b>automatic</b> <b>check-off</b> of union dues may become part of the collective bargaining agreement if both parties (i.e., the employer and the trade union) agree. If there are religious objections to paying dues the dues may be donated to a mutually agreed upon charity.|$|E
50|$|The FNPR was {{established}} in 1990, one year before {{the dissolution of the}} Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. After the breakup, With the exception of the military, the FNPR {{was one of the few}} national institutions to retain its power and functions. These abilities included control over the disbursement of social insurance funds, the right to contest and veto dismissal of workers, and <b>automatic</b> deductions, or <b>check-offs,</b> from employee wages.|$|R
50|$|Following its September 1932 formation, the PMA {{immediately}} {{sought to}} negotiate a new wage agreement for Illinois miners. A wage conference was called in Edwardsville, Illiniois in October, attended by a dissident segment of the state's mine operators, who were themselves divided as to the approach to be taken towards the organized labor movement. The contract negotiated between the dissident miners of the PMA and the dissident mine operators proved to be virtually identical to the agreement earlier rejected by the Illinois rank-and-file, ironically. The PMA did gain official recognition and an <b>automatic</b> dues <b>check-off</b> system, concessions necessary for the group's survival but failed to restore daily wage levels to the abandoned 1928 rate. Picketing against mines which refused to recognize the PMA was begun.|$|R
