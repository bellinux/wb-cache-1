40|$|In {{ultrasound}} elastography, tissue <b>axial</b> <b>strains</b> {{are obtained}} through the differentiation of measured axial displacements. However, during the measurement process, the displacement signals are often contaminated with de-correlation noise caused {{by changes in}} the speckle pattern in the tissue. Thus, {{the application of the}} gradient operator on the displacement signals results in the presence of amplified noise in the <b>axial</b> <b>strains,</b> which severely obscures the useful information. The use of an effective denoising scheme is therefore imperative. In this paper, a method based on a two-stage consecutive filtering approach is proposed for the accurate estimation of <b>axial</b> <b>strains.</b> The presented method considers a cascaded system of a frequency filter and a time window, which are both designed such that the overall system operates optimally as a minimum variance estimator.

5000|$|During pipe vibration, Dilation and Contraction of {{the pipe}} body, known as Poisson's ratio, takes place such that when the stuck pipe is {{subjected}} to <b>axial</b> <b>strain</b> due to stretching, its diameter will contract. Similarly, when the length of pipe is compressed, its diameter will expand. Since a length of pipe undergoing vibration experiences alternate tensile and compressive forces as waves along its longitudinal axis (and therefore longitudinal strains), its diameter will expand and contract in unison with the applied tensile and compressive waves. This means that for alternate moments during a vibration cycle the pipe may actually be physically free of its bond.|$|E
50|$|To {{accommodate}} the low or zero bending stiffness problem, very early versions of Flexcom {{were based on}} a 2D hybrid beam-column element. In this approach the axial force appeared as an explicit nodal solution variable, and was interpolated independently of the <b>axial</b> <b>strain.</b> The stress-strain compatibility relationship was applied outside of the virtual work statement by means of a Lagrangian constraint. This proved an accurate approach, and was subsequently extended to three dimensions. Further developments resulted in the addition of an extra Lagrangian constraint on the torque degree of freedom, {{in order to make the}} scheme more robust and accurate when this variable plays a significant role in the solution. This leads to a fourteen degree of freedom hybrid finite element with two end nodes, where the axial force and torque are added to the usual form of a three-dimensional beam element.|$|E
40|$|Physiological axial strains {{range between}} 40 and 60 % in arteries, {{resulting}} in stresses {{comparable to those}} due to normal blood pressure or flow. To investigate the contribution of <b>axial</b> <b>strain</b> to arterial remodeling and function, porcine carotid arteries were cultured for 9 days at physiological and reduced axial stretch ratios {{in the presence of}} normotensive and hypertensive transmural pressures by ex vivo perfusion techniques. Consistent with previous in vivo studies, vessels cultured with physiological levels of <b>axial</b> <b>strain</b> and exposed to hypertensive pressure had greater mass, wall area, and outer diameter relative to those cultured at the same axial stretch ratio and normotensive pressure. Reducing the amount of <b>axial</b> <b>strain</b> resulted in mass loss and decreased cell proliferation. Culture in a hypertensive pressure environment at reduced <b>axial</b> <b>strain</b> produced arteries with greater contractility in response to norepinephrine. Arteries cultured at reduced <b>axial</b> <b>strain</b> with the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor GM 6001 maintained their masses over culture, indicating a possible mechanism for this model of axial stretch-dependent remodeling. Although not historically considered one of the primary stimuli for remodeling, multiple linear regression analysis revealed that <b>axial</b> <b>strain</b> had an impact similar to or greater than transmural pressure on various remodeling indexes (i. e., outer diameter, wall area, and wet mass), suggesting that <b>axial</b> <b>strain</b> is a primary mediator of vascular remodeling...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new constitutive model for cyclic loading of soil {{to predict the}} behavior of soft clays under undrained cyclic triaxial loading. It is inspired by the modified Cam-clay theory, and a new yield surface for elastic unloading is proposed to capture the soil behavior under cyclic loading. Only two additional parameters that characterize the cyclic behavior are used together with the traditional parameters associated with the modified Cam-clay constitutive model. The details of the relevant soil properties, initial states, and cyclic loading conditions are presented, and a computational procedure for determining the effective stresses and strains is demonstrated. The new model is used to simulate cyclic triaxial tests on kaolin, and the model predictions are generally found to be {{in agreement with the}} measured excess pore pressures and <b>axial</b> <b>strains.</b> Furthermore, numerous factors that influence the cyclic performance of soft soils can be considered in the new model, such as cyclic stress ratios, preshearing, and cyclic loading frequency.

40|$|The thermoelastic {{martensitic}} transformation/MT/ {{induced by}} combination of external forces at constant temperature {{has been investigated}} by tension-torsion experiments with hollow bar specimens of Cu-Al-Zn-Mn polycrystalline shape memory alloy /SMA/. The mechanical work stored or released by independent external axial and torque forces has been related with the progress of MT. The reversibility of large inelastic strains and mechanical hysteresis of pseudoelastic material give rise to peculiar mechanical behaviors under general stress conditions, that are experimentaly described here. It is shown, that at least at low stresses, the polycrystalline SMA material can be loaded - unloaded by combination of general forces with precisely defined and well reproducible strain response for hundreds of cycles, provided that <b>axial</b> <b>strains</b> are reversible. The reversible <b>axial</b> <b>strains</b> can be controlled by change of torque force and vice versa due to the coupling among tension and torsion typical for deformation mechanism of thermoelastic MT.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated the}} ability to create engineered arteries by carefully controlling the mechanical environment of intact arteries perfused ex vivo, yielding engineered arteries with native appearance and vasoactive response. Increased <b>axial</b> <b>strain</b> was sufficient to increase length up to 20 % in 9 days through a growth and remodeling response. The amount of the achievable length increase, however, was highly dependent on the hemodynamic conditions acting through unknown mechanisms. Because matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) activity is increased, and often required, in mechanically induced remodeling in vivo, MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 expression was investigated to elucidate the hemodynamic mediation of artery length. Carotid arteries from 30 [*]kg pigs were perfused for 9 days ex vivo at either in situ <b>axial</b> <b>strain</b> or with a gradual 50 % increase in <b>axial</b> <b>strain,</b> under either arterial or reduced hemodynamics (∼ 10 % of arterial hemodynamics). MMP- 2 protein expression increased roughly twofold, while MMP- 9 expression increased threefold under either reduced hemodynamics or increased <b>axial</b> <b>strain</b> (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). The combination of reduced hemodynamics with increased <b>axial</b> <b>strain</b> demonstrated an additive increase in MMP- 9 protein (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) with no further change in MMP- 2 expression. To investigate the mechanism by which <b>axial</b> <b>strain</b> and hemodynamics could additively increase MMP- 9 expression, the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) subunits p 50 and p 65 was evaluated. <b>Axial</b> <b>strain</b> stimulated p 65 expression and localization, while hemodynamics increased p 50 expression, with both molecules being expressed only when both mechanical stimuli were applied.
