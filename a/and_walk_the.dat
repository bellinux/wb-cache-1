5|$|In 1597, King James wrote a {{dissertation}} on witchcraft titled Daemonologie {{in which he}} wrote the belief that demons could possess both {{the living and the}} dead. Within his classification of demons, he explained the concept through the notion that incubi and succubae could possess the corpse of the deceased <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>the</b> earth. As a devil borrows a dead body, it would seem so visibly and naturally to any man who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.|$|E
5|$|After the 1976 tour, Townshend took {{most of the}} {{following}} year off {{to spend time with}} his family. He discovered that former Beatles and Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein had bought a stake in his publishing company. A settlement was reached, but Townshend was upset and disillusioned that Klein had attempted to take ownership of his songs. Townshend went to the Speakeasy where he met the Sex Pistols' Steve Jones and Paul Cook, fans of the Who. After leaving, he passed out in a doorway, where a policeman said he would not be arrested if he could stand <b>and</b> <b>walk.</b> <b>The</b> events inspired the title track of the next album, Who Are You.|$|E

25|$|Under Hunt, fearing {{attack by}} the Niitsitapi, the {{overland}} expedition veered south of Lewis and Clark's route into what is now Wyoming {{and in the process}} passed across Union Pass and into Jackson Hole, Wyoming. From there they went over the Teton Range via Teton Pass and then down to the Snake River into modern Idaho. They abandoned their horses at the Snake River, made dugout canoes, and attempted to use the river for transport. After a few days' travel they soon discovered that steep canyons, waterfalls and impassable rapids made travel by river impossible. Too far from their horses to retrieve them, they had to cache most of their goods <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>the</b> rest of the way to the Columbia River where they made new boats and traveled to the newly established Fort Astoria. The expedition demonstrated that much of the route along the Snake River plain and across to the Columbia was passable by pack train or with minimal improvements, even wagons. This knowledge would be incorporated into the concatenated trail segments as the Oregon Trail took its early shape.|$|E

500|$|The Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway (L) was {{the third}} line, which opened on 25 June 1840, {{initially}} using the North Union station. However, relations between the NUR and L soured, and, from 1 January 1842, most L trains used, instead, Maxwell House railway station, a short distance {{to the north of}} the North Union station. A few trains passed through, but the NUR charged a toll of 6d per passenger. Most passengers refused to pay, preferring to alight at Maxwell House <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>the</b> [...] to the North Union station, but the NUR refused to hold the train to allow passengers to walk and rebook. The NUR advised northbound passengers to travel by the Lancaster Canal rather than the L On 1 January 1844, Maxwell House station came into the possession of the NUR, and lack of agreement led to several weeks when hapless L passengers had to alight on the trackside at nearby Dock Street (off Pitt Street). Lancaster trains were able to use the North Union station from 12 February.|$|E
500|$|Phantasmagoria is a point-and-click {{adventure}} {{game that}} features live-action actors and cinematic footage, both during scenes between the gameplay {{and within the}} three-dimensional rendered environments of the game itself. The game was made when interactive movie games were {{at the peak of}} their popularity, with the release of such popular computer games as Wing Commander III and Under a Killing Moon. In this single-player game, the player controls protagonist Adrienne Delaney, who is always on the screen. The player can click certain areas of the screen to control her movements or make her explore specific places and objects. The camera angles and rooms change depending on where the player moves Adrienne. The game includes only four mouse commands: look (which changes to [...] "talk to" [...] when selecting a person), pick up item, use item, <b>and</b> <b>walk.</b> <b>The</b> mouse cursor is always an arrow, unlike in most earlier Sierra On-Line games, in which the cursor could be changed to represent different functions (like walk, hand, and eye) by right-clicking. The cursor turns red when it passes over an area where the user can click to perform an action. Once the action has been completed, the cursor will not turn red again. Objects in the game can be picked up by clicking on them or interacting with them in a film sequence, after which the item automatically goes into the inventory. If an object is small enough that it can be easily missed, a pulsing glow occasionally surrounds it to draw attention to it.|$|E

2500|$|On December 9, 1858, Enterprise {{was caught}} in the ice on the Fraser River between Fort Hope and Fort Langley. [...] The vessel was short on food and accommodations, and so 114 [...] of the {{passengers}} decided to leave the steamer <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>the</b> remaining distance to Fort Langley.

2500|$|Army {{officials}} {{consider the}} GMV a needed {{addition to a}} global response force like the 82nd Airborne Division. [...] Currently, airdropped infantry would be flown to a target area or driven there by trucks. [...] Either way, they then need to dismount <b>and</b> <b>walk</b> <b>the</b> distance to their destination, sometimes for many miles while carrying heavy gear. [...] The GMV would allow light infantry to be driven right to their destination, allowing them to be airdropped further away from potential enemy fire and use mobility to find an off-road avenue of approach an adversary isn't expecting, and not be fatigued once they need to fight. [...] The idea was to acquire up to 300 vehicles {{by the end of}} 2016 at a unit cost of $149,000, which could decrease if a second increment was bought and stationed at installations for training; predicted dates were not certain as the entire effort remains subject to funding availability. Ability to be carried under a UH-60 Black Hawk in high/hot conditions is particularly important because battalion commanders cannot always get control of a CH-47 to carry heavier up-armored Humvees.|$|E
