The radioactive cloud from Buffalo 1 (One Tree) reached a height of , exceeding the predicted , and radioactivity was detected in South Australia, Northern Territory, New South Wales, and Queensland.

5|$|The {{design of}} the RP-77D made {{extensive}} use of glass-polyester plastic materials. The drone was launched using a rocket-assisted take-off system consisting of four Loki rockets, and was fitted with a radio control apparatus that, {{with the assistance of}} radar tracking, allowed the drone to be operated at a considerable distance from its launching point. In addition to equipment typically carried by target drones, the RP-77D could be equipped with reconnaissance or meteorological sensors, or with <b>air</b> <b>sampling</b> equipment. The RP-77D utilised the RPTA tracking system, developed by Radioplane, using audio frequency tones for control.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} role of fungi in the {{production}} of sick building syndrome. METHODS: A 22 month study in the United States of 48 schools (in which there had been concerns about health and indoor air quality (IAQ). Building indoor <b>air</b> and surface <b>samples,</b> as well as outdoor <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> were taken at all sites to look for the presence of fungi or their viable propagules. RESULTS: Five fungal genera were consistently found in the outdoor air and comprised over 95 % of the outdoor fungi. These genera were Cladosporium (81. 5 %), Penicillium (5. 2 %), Chrysosporium (4. 9 %), Alternaria (2. 8 %), and Aspergillus (1. 1 %). At 20 schools, there were significantly more colony forming units per cubic metre (CFU/m 3) (p < 0. 0001) of propagules of Penicillium species in the <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> from complaint areas when compared with the outdoor <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> and the indoor <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> from noncomplaint areas. At five schools, there were more, although not significant (p = 0. 10), Penicillium propagules in the <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> from complaint areas when compared with the outdoor <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> and the indoor <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> from noncomplaint areas. In 11 schools, the indoor air (complaint areas) fungal ratios were similar to that in the outdoor air. In these 11 schools Stachybotrys atra was isolated from swab samples of visible growth under wetted carpets, on wetted walls, or behind vinyl wall coverings. In the remaining 11 schools, the fungal ratios and CFU/m 3 of air were not significantly different in different areas. Many of the schools took remedial action that resulted in an indoor air fungal profile that was similar to that outdoors. CONCLUSIONS: Propagules of Penicillium and Stachybotrys species may be associated with sick building syndrome...|$|R

The system is designed to identify sources of air pollution based on the directional collection of field <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> and their analysis for TSP and trace element characteristics. Sources can be identified by analyzing the data on the basis of pattern recognition concepts. The unit, designated Air Scout, receives wind direction signals from an associated wind vane. <b>Air</b> <b>samples</b> are collected on filter slides using a standard high volume <b>air</b> <b>sampler</b> drawing <b>air</b> through a porting arrangement which tracks the wind direction and permits collection of discrete samples. A preset timer controls the length of time each filter is in the sampling position.

40|$|Airborne {{transmission}} of influenza A virus (IAV) in swine is speculated {{to be an}} important route of virus dissemination, but data are scarce. This study attempted to detect and quantify airborne IAV by virus isolation and RRT-PCR in <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> collected under field conditions. This was accomplished by collecting <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> from four acutely infected pig farms and locating air samplers inside the barns, at the external exhaust fans and downwind from the farms at distances up to 2. 1 km. IAV was detected in <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> collected in 3 out of 4 farms included in the study. Isolation of IAV was possible from <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> collected inside the barn at two of the farms and in one farm from the exhausted air. Between 13 % and 100 % of samples collected inside the barns tested RRT-PCR positive with an average viral load of 3. 20 E+ 05 IAV RNA copies/m³ of air. Percentage of exhaust positive <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> also ranged between 13 % and 100 % with an average viral load of 1. 79 E+ 04 RNA copies/m³ of air. Influenza virus RNA was detected in <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> collected between 1. 5 and 2. 1 Km away from the farms with viral levels significantly lower at 4. 65 E+ 03 RNA copies/m³. H 1 N 1, H 1 N 2 and H 3 N 2 subtypes were detected in the <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> and the hemagglutinin gene sequences identified in the swine samples matched those in aerosols providing evidence that the viruses detected in the aerosols originated from the pigs in the farms under study. Overall our results indicate that pigs can be a source of IAV infectious aerosols and that these aerosols can be exhausted from pig barns and be transported downwind.
