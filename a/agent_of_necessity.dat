50|$|In the {{majority}} of cases, {{it is impossible for}} agents to seek specific authority for every deal or detail within a deal. <b>Agents</b> must, <b>of</b> <b>necessity,</b> be allowed some degree of discretion in the conduct of routine transactions. But, for the purposes of ascribing legal responsibility to the Principal, when the Agent acts with actual or apparent authority, all the Agent's knowledge will be imputed to the Principal. If Principals were allowed to hide behind their agents' own ignorance, mistakes or failures to communicate, a Principal could, by using an Agent, achieve a better result than if they acted personally. For example, if the particular deal turned out well, the Principal could adopt the transaction. But, if it turned out badly, the Principal could disavow it. Indeed, if not for imputation, there would be a perverse incentive to conduct business through Agents rather than personally. Consequently, the Principal cannot exploit ignorance to their advantage by instructing the Agent to withhold key information or by appointing an Agent known to be secretive.|$|R
40|$|Complex {{systems are}} {{collections}} <b>of</b> independent <b>agents</b> interacting to as to produce emergent, often unexpected, behaviour. Computer based simulation {{is one of}} the main ways of studying complex systems and a naıve approach to such simulation is fraught with difficulty due to the scope for deadlock in various patterns of interaction between the <b>agents</b> which are <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> sharing aspects <b>of</b> the computational platform. Agent behaviour, though, can be entirely looked at from the point of view of the environments within which the agents interact. Structuring a simulation purely in this manner leads to a simulation that has essentially no tendency to deadlock and still behaves in the manner required. A number of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. These start with a simple flocking system and continue through an investigation of the ways in which multiple environments can best be combined. Finally, a larger scale experiment investigating the evolution of variety in a rich environment shows that interesting results can be obtained of a simulation constructed in this manner...|$|R

40|$|Plan {{recognition}} {{is the process}} <b>of</b> observing another <b>agent's</b> behavior(s) and inferring what, and possibly why, the agent is acting as it is. Plan recognition becomes a very important means of acquiring such information about other agents in situations and domains where explicit communication is either very costly, dangerous, or impossible. Performing plan recognition in a physical domain (i. e. the real world) forces the world's ubiquitous uncertainty upon the observing <b>agent</b> because <b>of</b> the <b>necessity</b> to use real sensors to make the observations. We have developed a multiple resolution, hierarchical plan recognition system to coordinate the motion of two interacting mobile robots. Uncertainty arises in the system from dead reckoning errors that accumulate while the robots are moving, {{as well as by}} errors in the computer vision system that is used to detect the other agent's behaviors. Based upon belief networks, the plan recognition system gracefully degrades in performance as the level [...] ...|$|R

The main features of the socio-economic situation in Russia today are presented (horizontal and vertical mobility of the population, a small number of organizations and the extra-centralized public authorities, the predominance of personal relations between economic <b>agents).</b> The <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> increasing the role of individuals and businesses in the social system is substantiated and the basic directions of activity are suggested (prosocial preferences, interpersonal trust, redistribution of social responsibility). Transparency and accountability of public authorities are very powerful tool {{to improve the quality of}} governance and it is one of the important conditions for the social responsibility, as well as to economic performance in modern Russia. The legitimacy of government is a multidimensional issue. And if we take into account the Russian features it is necessary to point out public control and enforcement, quality of formal institutions, and effectiveness of enforcement mechanisms. Also governance is important to enhance quality of regulation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In the 4 th century BC, the Greek philosopher Diodoros Chronos gave a {{temporal}} definition <b>of</b> <b>necessity.</b> Because it connects modality and temporality, this definition {{is of interest}} to philosophers working within branching time or branching spacetime models. This definition <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> can be formalized and treated within a logical framework. We give {{a survey of the}} several known modal and temporal logics of abstract space-time structures based on the real numbers and the integers, considering three different accessibility relations between spatio-temporal points. 1. A Temporal Notion <b>of</b> <b>Necessity</b> <b>Of</b> the many different interpretations which can be given to the concept <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> (logical necessity, physical necessity, deontic <b>necessity,</b> etc.), one <b>of</b> the most interesting from the formal point of view is the definition <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> put forward by the Stoic logician Diodoros Chronos.
