25|$|In some multi-standard sockets the <b>aperture</b> <b>size</b> for NEMA plugs is {{the same}} for both Line (Hot) and Neutral (see second picture), which may defeat the {{polarization}} of NEMA 1 plugs. In a socket designed to accept both NEMA and BS 1363 plugs, the lower right contact (in the orientation shown in the picture) should be connected to the Line wire for BS 1363 plugs, but the Neutral wire for NEMA plugs, so safe wiring of these devices for universal use is not possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of these trade-offs imply {{that no matter what}} photon wavelength and <b>aperture</b> <b>size</b> are used, the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is {{greater than or equal to}} a lower limit, which is (up to a small numerical factor) equal to Planck's constant. Heisenberg did not care to formulate the uncertainty principle as an exact limit (which is elaborated below), and preferred to use it instead, as a heuristic quantitative statement, correct up to small numerical factors, which makes the radically new noncommutativity of quantum mechanics inevitable.|$|E
25|$|In most imaging devices, {{the degree}} of {{exposure}} to light applied to the active element (be it film or CCD) can be altered {{in one of two}} ways: by either increasing/decreasing the size of the aperture or by increasing/decreasing the time of each exposure. Exposure variation in an HDR set is only done by altering the exposure time and not the aperture size; this is because altering the <b>aperture</b> <b>size</b> also affects the depth of field and so the resultant multiple images would be quite different, preventing their final combination into a single HDR image.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{technique}} for the accurate measurement and adjustment of fracture apertures in digital images of fractured media is presented. We utilize X-ray micro-computed tomography to image a highly fractured coal sample and collect high-resolution {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) images from the samples surface to facilitate segmentation of coal fractures. The gray-scale micro-CT values at the mid-point of fractures are obtained and correlated to <b>aperture</b> <b>sizes</b> measured with the higher resolution SEM data. Afterwards, the micro-CT images are upsampled to enable assignment of <b>aperture</b> <b>sizes</b> smaller than the image resolution. We initially segment the coal image, upsample the segmented image, and then re-calibrate the fracture <b>aperture</b> <b>sizes.</b> The final calibrated segmented image contains the fracture network acquired from the micro-CT data with precise <b>aperture</b> <b>sizes</b> assigned based on the high-resolution SEM data. To illustrate the importance of accurate aperture measurement, two coal subsets are tested. The permeabilities before and after applying the calibration method are measured. The results show {{a significant change in}} numerical permeabilities after applying the calibration method. This indicates that a large amount of information is potentially omitted when utilizing standard image segmentation tools to segment fractured media...|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} grind {{telescope}} optics into an accurate shape, a highly versatile material {{must be used}} such as glass. The amateur casting process is usually done through a temperature controlled glass fusing kiln, in which layers or chunks of glass (usually plate or borosilicate glass) are stacked on top of or around each other within a round mold specified to <b>aperture</b> <b>size.</b> After the melting point is reached, the glass fuses together and then the annealing process begins. Proper annealing procedures ensure that internal stresses are relieved within the glass, which reduces risk of failure for the newly cast blank.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{shielding}} {{ability of}} a shielding cavity with an aperture will be greatly degraded at resonance frequencies, and the resonance modes and frequencies are affected by aperture resonances and aperture-cavity coupling, which are closely related with <b>aperture</b> <b>sizes.</b> The equivalent circuit method and numerical method of Transmission Line Matrix (TLM) are {{used to analyze the}} effects of aperture resonances and aperture-cavity coupling on the electromagnetic resonances of a cavity with an aperture in this paper. Both analytical and numerical results show that the resonance modes of a shielding cavity with an aperture consist of cavity resonance modes and aperture resonance modes, and the resonance frequencies will shift with the change of the <b>aperture</b> <b>sizes</b> because of the aperture resonances and aperture-cavity coupling. Variation rules of electromagnetic resonances with <b>aperture</b> <b>sizes</b> for a cavity with an aperture are given, which will be useful for design of shielding cavities.

2500|$|The {{aperture}} stop of a photographic lens {{can be adjusted}} to control the amount of light reaching the film or image sensor. In combination with variation of shutter speed, the <b>aperture</b> <b>size</b> will regulate the film's or image sensor's degree of exposure to light. [...] Typically, a fast shutter will require a larger aperture to ensure sufficient light exposure, and a slow shutter will require a smaller aperture to avoid excessive exposure.|$|E
2500|$|Aperture-limited horn – a long narrow horn, {{long enough}} so the phase error is a {{negligible}} {{fraction of a}} wavelength, so it essentially radiates a plane wave. [...] It has an aperture efficiency of 1.0 so it gives the maximum gain and minimum beamwidth for a given <b>aperture</b> <b>size.</b> [...] The gain is not affected by the length but only limited by diffraction at the aperture. [...] Used as feed horns in radio telescopes and other high-resolution antennas.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the size}} of a horn (expressed in wavelengths) is increased, the phase error increases, giving the horn a wider {{radiation}} pattern. [...] Keeping the beamwidth narrow requires a longer horn (smaller flare angle) to keep the phase error constant. [...] The increasing phase error limits the <b>aperture</b> <b>size</b> of practical horns to about 15 wavelengths; larger apertures would require impractically long horns. [...] This limits the gain of practical horns to about 1000 (30 dBi) and the corresponding minimum beamwidth to about 5 - 10°.|$|E

For these specimens, sound absorption coefficient increased with increasing porosity. On the other hand, sound absorption coefficient varied inconsistently with the variation of pore sizes.

The particle sizes were associated with the mesh <b>aperture</b> <b>sizes,</b> namely when the mesh <b>aperture</b> <b>sizes</b> decreased, the particle sizes decreased.

Calpain inhibitors will be a promising drug for curing intractable diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Therefore, utilizing the calpain-inhibitor-nanocrystal-based drug delivery system targeting such intractable diseases will be quite attractive topics in the near future, and thus our fundamental findings of preparing calpain inhibitor nanocrystals in this research are noteworthy. We are also investigating the preparation of water dispersion of calpain inhibitor nanocrystals.

40|$|A higher {{achievable}} {{scan speed}} and {{the capability to}} integrate two scan axes in a very compact device are fundamental advantages of MEMS scanning mirrors over conventional galvanometric scanners. There is a growing demand for biaxial high speed scanning systems complementing the rapid progress of high power lasers for enabling {{the development of new}} high throughput manufacturing processes. This paper presents concept, design, fabrication and test of biaxial large aperture MEMS scanning mirrors (LAMM) with <b>aperture</b> <b>sizes</b> up to 20 mm for use in high-power laser applications. To keep static and dynamic deformation of the mirror acceptably low all MEMS mirrors exhibit full substrate thickness of 725 μm. The LAMM-scanners are being vacuum packaged on wafer-level based on a stack of 4 wafers. Scanners with <b>aperture</b> <b>sizes</b> up to 12 mm are designed as a 4 -DOF-oscillator with amplitude magnification applying electrostatic actuation for driving a motor-frame. As an example a 7 -mm-scanner is presented that achieves an optical scan angle of 32 degrees at 3. 2 kHz. LAMM-scanners with <b>apertures</b> <b>sizes</b> of 20 mm are designed as passive high-Q-resonators to be externally excited by low-cost electromagnetic or piezoelectric drives. Multi-layer dielectric coatings with a reflectivity higher than 99. 9 % have enabled to apply cw-laser power loads of more than 600 W without damaging the MEMS mirror. Finally, a new excitation concept for resonant scanners is presented providing advantageous shaping of intensity profiles of projected laser patterns without modulating the laser. This is of interest in lighting applications such as automotive laser headlights...|$|R
