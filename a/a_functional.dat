Specifically, if <b>a</b> linear <b>functional</b> is defined on a subspace of a real vector space which is dominated by <b>a</b> sublinear <b>functional</b> on the entire space, then this functional can be extended to <b>a</b> linear <b>functional</b> on the entire space which is still dominated by <b>a</b> sublinear <b>functional.</b> In this paper, we generalize this result to show that <b>a</b> linear <b>functional</b> defined on <b>a</b> subspace of a real vector space which is dominated by <b>a</b> sublinear <b>functional</b> and also dominates <b>a</b> superlinear <b>functional</b> on the entire space can be extended to <b>a</b> linear <b>functional</b> on the entire space which is also dominated by <b>a</b> sublinear <b>functional</b> and dominates <b>a</b> superlinear <b>functional...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} how soil microbial communities and arsenic (<b>As)</b> <b>functional</b> genes respond to soil arsenic (As) contamination, five soils contaminated with As {{at different levels}} were collected from diverse geographic locations, incubated for 54 days under flooded conditions, and examined by both MiSeq sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene amplicons and functional gene microarray (GeoChip 4. 0). The results showed that both bacterial community structure and <b>As</b> <b>functional</b> gene structure differed among geographical locations. The diversity of <b>As</b> <b>functional</b> genes correlated positively with the diversity of 16 S rRNA genes (P< 0. 05). Higher diversities of <b>As</b> <b>functional</b> genes and 16 S rRNA genes were observed in the soils with higher available As. Soil pH, phosphate-extractable As, and amorphous Fe content {{were the most important}} factors in shaping the bacterial community structure and <b>As</b> transformation <b>functional</b> genes. Geographic location was also important in controlling both the bacterial community and <b>As</b> transformation <b>functional</b> potential. These findings provide insights into the variation of <b>As</b> transformation <b>functional</b> genes in soils contaminated with different levels of As at different geographic locations, and the impact of environmental As contamination on the soil bacterial community...|$|R
