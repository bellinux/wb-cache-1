40|$|Spike-frequency {{adaptation}} is {{a common}} feature of neural dynamics. Here we present a low-dimensional phenomenological model whose parameters can be easily determined from experimental data. We test the model on intracellular recordings from auditory receptor neurons of locusts and demonstrate that the temporal variation of discharge rate is predicted with high accuracy. We relate the model to biophysical descriptions of adaptation in conductance-based models and analyze its implications for neural computation. Key words: Spike-frequency <b>adaptation,</b> <b>ring</b> rate, conductance-based models, Locust 1 Introduction Neural activity results from {{a large number of}} interacting ionic currents across the cell membrane. Biophysically motivated neuron models such as the Hodgkin-Huxley model may reproduce the membrane potential with high precision. For theoretical investigations, however, abstract models, like integrateand -re neurons, have the advantage that they do not depend on a large num- 1 [...] ...|$|E

Proposing a 5850 to 7075 MHz band of working frequency, {{by means of}} microwave laminate RT/D 5880 (εr = 2. 2 and thickness of 1. 82 mm). The antenna is wholly organized into three layers consisting of circular copper sheet as ground plane, an undersized main radiator for where signal will pass through to resonate and ended with designed split rings entrenched on layer three laminate. All layers are separated by an air gap, simulated and optimized carefully using Microwave Studio of Computer Simulation Technology Suite (CST). Provided that, dimension of air gap, split ring quantity and entrenched split ring width are monitored as key controllers. Via transient solver, it presents corresponding S-parameter results and provides 3 D view farfield. Thus demonstrating how each key controllers influence the antenna in terms of bandwidth, directivity, gain and efficiency produced. These works conclude that <b>adaptation</b> of split <b>rings</b> can enhance and improve this particular antenna. Index Term — CCSRRs, CMS, CSMA, SRR I...|$|R
