5000|$|FuG 243 : By 1944 the Germans {{were aware}} of the {{operating}} concept of the British Rebecca/Eureka system via captured examples. From this a series of <b>radar</b> <b>beacons</b> were designed to respond to different frequencies and waveforms. The FuG243 seems to be the only one that entered service in small numbers in early 1945 in Norway with coastal units. It operated on the low-UHF band frequencies used by the FuG 200 Hohentwiel ASV airborne radar hardware. In modern terms it was a type of <b>Radar</b> <b>beacon</b> (racon) ...|$|R
5000|$|AN/MPN-2 was {{a mobile}} <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> which {{provided}} navigational aid and homing facilities for aircraft. Its major components, AN/CPN-6, and AN/CPN-8, were mounted {{in a trailer}} van.|$|R
50|$|It is the General Lighthouse Authority for England, Wales, the Channel Islands and Gibraltar, {{responsible}} {{for a range of}} general aids to navigation, 'signs of the sea', from lighthouses to <b>radar</b> <b>beacons.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Transponders are now {{installed}} in most general aviation aircraft and all commercial/air-carrier aircraft, dramatically increasing radar visibility of lower and slower-flying smaller aircraft, especially near atmospheric disturbances or other clutter (see Air Traffic Control <b>Radar</b> <b>Beacon</b> System and Secondary Surveillance Radar) ...|$|R
50|$|In 1963, {{in order}} to help nearby Hualien Harbor become an {{international}} port, a new lighthouse, consisting of a white pentagon concrete building, was built on the original lighthouse base. The newly built Qilaibi Lighthouse used a 4th class white light electric lamp, the light flashing 3 seconds and dimming 3 seconds at a regular 6 second intervals, and the luminous intensity is 28,000 cd. In 1973, a non-directional beacon pole was added, with output power 100 watts and range 100 nms, to function in coordination with the Lyudao Lighthouse, also a non-directional beacon pole, for the ships mutual positioning. In 1985, a <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> pole was set. Then finally, in 1992, the communication systems were comprehensively changed into a dual-frequency <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> pole.|$|R
50|$|The 3rd Order optic was {{replaced}} by a rotating beacon, which possessed a revolving array of 24 lamps-cum-reflectors. An ‘S’ and ‘X’ band <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> was also installed in 1984 which provides additional navigational information to ships by emitting a morse code on the ship’s radar screen.|$|R
50|$|The Phipps couple flew {{together}} to the North Pole in a Twin Otter ski plane to the North Pole, {{to install a}} <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> and to promote northern travel.

50|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>beacon</b> AN/UPN-1, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} BUPS (Beacon, Ultra Portable, S-band), is an ultra-portable radio beacon for ground, paratroop or shipboard use having {{a range of}} 35 to 50 miles. The set is capable of being interrogated by airborne <b>radars</b> operating on <b>beacon</b> function and replying with a coded signal permitting the beacon to be located in range and azimuth. It is capable of transmitting five different codes, it transmits on 3256 Mc. and receives on 3333 Mc. peak power out-put is 50 Watts.|$|R
50|$|SHORAN is {{an acronym}} for SHOrt RAnge Navigation, a type of {{electronic}} navigation and bombing system using a precision <b>radar</b> <b>beacon.</b> It was developed during World War II and the first stations were being set up in Europe when the war ended. It saw its first combat use in the B-26 and B-29 bomber aircraft during the Korean War.|$|R
50|$|The {{low clouds}} and {{extremely}} intense anti-aircraft fire caused the pathfinder sticks {{to be dropped}} off course, with only one stick landing in the correct place (Ambrose, p. 196). Their <b>radar</b> <b>beacons</b> did work somewhat effectively; even though the pathfinders set up their equipment off course, many of the sticks of follow up paratroopers landed clustered near these beacons.|$|R
50|$|Buoys {{serviced}} by the Papaw ranged from tiny 6 ft nun buoys to the 35 ft tall 18,000 lb Galveston Entrance Channel Buoy. Most buoys {{are equipped with}} electrical lights powered by batteries and solar cells. Some have sound signals, <b>radar</b> <b>beacons,</b> and elaborate power systems. All buoys are pulled from the water {{at least once a}} year for painting, maintenance, and position checks.|$|R
50|$|The {{air traffic}} control <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> system (ATCRBS) is a system used in {{air traffic control}} (ATC) to enhance {{surveillance}} radar monitoring and separation of air traffic. ATCRBS assists ATC surveillance radars by acquiring information about the aircraft being monitored, and providing this information to the radar controllers. The controllers can use the information to identify radar returns from aircraft (known as targets) and to distinguish those returns from ground clutter.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} towers at the site. The tallest {{one is a}} 55-metre high {{civilian}} telecommunication tower, owned by Télédiffusion de France. The telecommunication tower is topped by a radome and contains a mode S air traffic control <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> system owned by the Directorate General for Civil Aviation. The radar has been in operation since 18 August 2009 but has experienced malfunctions due to heavy snowfall in the area.|$|R
5000|$|The present {{lighthouse}} equipment {{consists of}} a main and standby rotating beacon, each producing 117,000 candelas with a nominal range of [...] A <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> (racon) was also installed at the lighthouse which provides additional navigational information to ships by emitting a Morse code on the ship's radar screen. In 2005, an Aids to Navigation Automatic Identification System (AIS) was installed to broadcast additional positioning information to ships.|$|R
50|$|Another type of {{transponder}} {{occurs in}} {{identification friend or foe}} systems in military aviation and in {{air traffic control}} secondary surveillance <b>radar</b> (<b>beacon</b> <b>radar)</b> systems for general aviation and commercial aviation. Primary radar works best with large all-metal aircraft, but not so well on small, composite aircraft. Its range is also limited by terrain and rain or snow and also detects unwanted objects such as automobiles, hills and trees. Furthermore, it cannot always estimate the altitude of an aircraft. Secondary radar overcomes these limitations but it depends on a transponder in the aircraft to respond to interrogations from the ground station to make the plane more visible.|$|R
50|$|Their {{characteristics}} are {{defined in the}} ITU-R Recommendation M.824, Technical Parameters of <b>Radar</b> <b>Beacons</b> (RACONS). Racons usually operate on the 9320 MHz to 9500 MHz marine radar band (X-band), and most also operate on the 2920 MHz to 3100 MHz marine radar band (S-band). Modern racons are frequency-agile; they have a wide-band receiver that detects the incoming radar pulse, tunes the transmitter and responds with a 25 microsecond long signal within 700 nanoseconds.|$|R
5000|$|Underwater {{demolition}} teams (UDT) {{approached the}} beach in small craft to reconnoiter the landing beaches and to plant <b>radar</b> <b>beacons</b> which would provide reference points to the next day's landing. Tennessee closed to 3,000 yd of Agingan Point and opened up with 14 in, 5 inand [...] batteries. Some smoldering powder grains from the 5 in guns fell {{on the port side}} of the battleship's quarterdeck and burst into flame, but were quickly extinguished.|$|R
50|$|Easton {{was born}} in Craftsbury, Vermont, to Dr. Frank B. Easton, a physician, and Della Donnocker, a school teacher. He {{graduated}} from Middlebury College in 1943. He also attended the University of Michigan for 1 semester before joining the Naval Research Laboratory in 1943. At the Naval Research Laboratory {{he worked in the}} Radio Division on <b>radar</b> <b>beacons</b> and blind-landing systems. Easton also worked in the laboratory's Rocket-Sonde Branch which was dealing with space related research.|$|R

50|$|Melpar linked {{production}} facilities to its scientific and engineering capabilities. The company won two large contracts for B-58 aircraft electronics and Minuteman missile guidance components, requiring {{a buildup of}} manufacturing plants and an associated technical work force in the Washington area. These facilities enabled scientists to test their laboratory research with prototype hardware. By 1960 the company assembled products such as missile equipment, flight simulators, <b>radar</b> <b>beacons,</b> fuses, data processing equipment, communications, antennas, electronic countermeasure and reconnaissance systems.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>beacon</b> (short: racon) is - {{according}} to article 1.103 of the International Telecommunication Union´s (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) - defined as [...] "A transmitter-receiver {{associated with a}} fixed navigational mark which, when triggered by a radar, automatically returns a distinctive signal which can appear on the display of the triggering radar, providing range, bearing and identification information." [...] Each station (transmitter-receiver, radar) shall be classified by the service in which it operates permanently or temporarily.|$|R
50|$|Radar {{made its}} {{appearance}} during World War II, primarily {{in its early}} warning capability. In {{the early days of}} the Cold War, Soviet troops would use a directional <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> to lure surveillance aircraft toward their airspace in order to shoot them down. By this time radar scopes became available in larger aircraft monitoring Soviet-controlled border areas. Having these scopes made early radar navigation possible, indeed, in photos released by the Soviet air force, pictures were taken of the screens, documenting this use.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{reaching}} Mars, {{the upper}} stage would be jettisoned, with the Habitat Unit aerobraking into Mars orbit before soft-landing in {{proximity to the}} Earth Return Vehicle. Precise landing would be supported by a <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> started by the first lander. Once on Mars, the crew would spend 18 months on the surface, carrying out a range of scientific research, aided by a small rover vehicle carried aboard their Mars Habitat Unit, and powered by the methane produced by the Earth Return Vehicle.|$|R

S. Navy Certificate of Commendation for Outstanding Service for development of the AN/CPN-6 <b>Radar</b> <b>Beacon,</b> a microwave device which aided carrier pilots to find their ship during low visibility conditions.|$|R
50|$|The International Maritime Organization's International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea {{requires}} the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to be fitted aboard international voyaging ships with , and all passenger ships regardless of size. Although AIS transmitters/receivers are generally called transponders they generally transmit autonomously, although coast stations can interrogate class B transponders on smaller vessels for additional information. In addition, navigational aids often have transponders called RACON (<b>radar</b> <b>beacons)</b> {{designed to make}} them stand out on a ship's radar screen.|$|R
5000|$|In 1984, the {{lighthouse}} was automated being remotely monitored and controlled at the Northern Lighthouse Board's offices in Edinburgh, but originally, the lens was rotated by a clockwork mechanism with gradually descending weights providing the energy. The original lens {{is on display}} at the Lossiemouth Fisheries and Community Museum.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest on the various applications of the SSR Mode S (Secondary surveillance radar - mode Selective) for air traffic and airport traffic management. This paper discusses the applications of ICAO standard Mode S signals, in particular in the down link channel around 1090 MHz, to locate and identify cooperating targets in the airport using Multilateration (MLAT) and in the terminal area/en route using Wide Area Multilateration (WAM). Performance analyses and some comparison with the more traditional SSR system (ATC <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> system : ATCBRS) are carried out...|$|R
50|$|In late September 1968 1st Marine Division {{intelligence}} {{detected the}} presence of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 21st Regiment, 2nd Division, 141st Regiment and the 368B Rocket Regiment near the Thường Ðức Camp. In an early morning attack on 28 September the PAVN overran two of the Camp's outposts. As bad weather made tactical air support impossible a Marine tactical air control group flew into the camp with a <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> which was used to guide Marine A-6s to make precision bombing attacks on the PAVN positions forcing them to abandon them on 29 September.|$|R
50|$|Problematically, {{there were}} IFF {{incompatibilities}} {{that threatened to}} label friendly aircraft as foe for want of an IFF signal showing otherwise. The risk of mis-identification of targets and consequent friendly fire casualties rose significantly. Until the squadron was completely re-equipped with new aircraft using only centimetric radar, {{it was necessary to}} ensure that all fighter aircraft in the air at any one time had either VHF or S-Band equipment - never a mixture. The S-Band equipped Beaufighters were unable {{to make use of the}} VHF <b>Radar</b> <b>Beacons.</b> The changeover was not completed until August 1943, just prior to the squadron's departure to Sicily.|$|R
50|$|Work {{began on}} the Ōmazaki Lighthouse in September 1920, and it was first lit on November 1, 1921. During World War II, it was {{repeatedly}} hit by air strikes by United States Navy aircraft and by 1945 it was in ruins. While being rebuilt after the war, it was again severely damaged by the 1952 Tokachioki earthquake. The second generation lighthouse was completed in July 1953. A <b>radar</b> <b>beacon</b> was established on April 17, 1983. Since April 1, 1993, the lighthouse has been fully automated, and is now unmanned. The lighthouse is maintained by the Japan Coast Guard.|$|R
