5|$|Parenting style {{seems to}} have no major effect, {{although}} people with supportive parents do better than those with critical or hostile parents. Childhood trauma, death of <b>a</b> <b>parent,</b> <b>and</b> being bullied or abused increase the risk of psychosis. Living in an urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by a factor of two, even after taking into account drug use, ethnic group, and size of social group. Other factors that play an important role include social isolation and immigration related to social adversity, racial discrimination, family dysfunction, unemployment, and poor housing conditions.|$|E

(Gallop, 1997) However, it is this parallel that many say is the reason teacher-pupil sexual contact and relations are immoral because they are too closely akin to incest, and similar long-term damages can result.|$|E
25|$|A {{change in}} the genetic {{structure}} that is not inherited from <b>a</b> <b>parent,</b> <b>and</b> also not passed to offspring, is called a somatic cell genetic mutation or acquired mutation. Somatic mutations are not inherited because this type of mutation {{does not affect the}} reproductive cells (sperm and egg) but it can affect any other type of cell. These types of mutations are usually prompted by environmental causes, such as ultraviolet radiation or any exposure to certain harmful chemicals. This type of mutation can cause various diseases; a common one is cancer.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{partnership}} in the District {{used to be}} open to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples.

All couples registered as domestic partners are entitled to the same rights as family members and spouses to visit their domestic partners in the hospital and jail and to make decisions concerning the treatment of a domestic partner's remains and estate after the partner's death.|$|E

25|$|The {{psychiatric}} {{assessment of}} a child or adolescent starts with obtaining a psychiatric history by interviewing the young person and his/her parents or caregivers. The assessment includes a detailed exploration of the current concerns about the child's emotional or behavioral problems, the child's physical health and development, history of parental care (including possible abuse and neglect), family relationships and history of parental mental illness. It is regarded as desirable to obtain information from multiple sources (for example both parents, or <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> a grandparent) as informants may give widely differing accounts of the child's problems. Collateral information is usually obtained from the child's school with regards to academic performance, peer relationships, and behavior in the school environment.|$|E
25|$|Fostering {{resilience}} {{in children}} requires family environments that are caring and stable, hold {{high expectations for}} childrenâ€™s behavior and encourage participation {{in the life of}} the family. Most resilient children have a strong relationship with at least one adult, not always <b>a</b> <b>parent,</b> <b>and</b> this relationship helps to diminish risk associated with family discord. The definition of parental resilience, as the capacity of parents to deliver a competent and quality level of parenting to children, despite the presence of risk factors, has proven to be a very important role in children's resilience. Understanding the characteristics of quality parenting is critical to the idea of parental resilience. Even if divorce produces stress, the availability of social support from family and community can reduce this stress and yield positive outcomes. Any family that emphasizes the value of assigned chores, caring for brothers or sisters, and the contribution of part-time work in supporting the family helps to foster resilience. Resilience research has traditionally focused on the well being of children, with limited academic attention paid to factors that may contribute to the resilience of parents.|$|E

Ricky and Jack pester Sam to a get a paternity test, which she eventually does. She lies, claiming Ricky is the father, however Bianca discovers the truth and Sam confesses that she has lied because Ronnie, Jack's girlfriend, asked her to. Ronnie does not want Sam or her baby near Jack. She manipulates Sam into leaving and pays her money to do so. Sam leaves but, fearful of bringing up her baby alone, she seduces Minty, who still loves her, suggesting he goes with her. Minty momentarily accepts, but then realises Sam is merely using him and turns her down. Sam departs with Richard, moving to Portugal to live with Grant.|$|E

500|$|Co-creator J. J. Abrams' {{inspiration}} for Fringe {{came from a}} range of sources, including the writings of Michael Crichton, the Ken Russell film Altered States, and the television series The X-Files and The Twilight Zone. The specific story for Fringe was developed during long conversations between series creators Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. The team was discussing several different options, and the idea behind Fringe appealed to them most because it contained a long-term story and characters' backstories which were not [...] "evident but alluded to in the pilot". The team {{spent a lot of time}} thinking about the [...] "trifecta of characters" [...] that they needed to have in the series, and why there were uniquely interesting. The creators decided on the idea of a father-son story because it was compelling and accessible, [...] "you don't necessarily have to know anything about science, because everyone has <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> everyone has issues with <b>a</b> <b>parent.</b> <b>And</b> I think for us it's always about coming into it through character". Orci stated that the series is a combination of a procedural and an [...] "extremely serialized and very culty" [...] series, quoting as examples of each, Law & Order and Lost.|$|E

Writing for The Huffington Post, music journalist Kristi York Wooten said, [...] "Each song is {{a gift from the}} artists, given in honor of mothers everywhere". She offered commentary on select tracks, including [...] "Skipping" [...] (the [...] "sentiment about the unique bond between <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> child transcends both gender and time"), and [...] "Pretty Day", which she said [...] "might get you singing along instantly". Wooten called Beck's contribution [...] "thematically coherent and stylistically diverse", and Smith's track [...] "arresting", [...] "reflective and beautiful".|$|E
500|$|According to Traci Paige Johnson, {{one of the}} {{producers}} and creators of Blue's Clues, Patton's character {{was more like a}} preschooler and more innocent than Steve. Angela Santomero, another producer and creator, stated that Patton's characterization as Joe brought him closer to the preschool viewer as Joe was more willing to [...] "jump into a problem rather than figure it out first like Steve". Patton liked working on Blue's Clues because, as he stated, [...] "I got to go be a kid for twelve hours a day". [...] He called the show's crew [...] "a real fun little family" [...] and a [...] "well-oiled machine" [...] by the time he joined the show. Patton remained on the show until the show's cancellation, and also appeared in its spin-off, Blue's Room, which premiered in 2004. Several years later, Patton said he had not yet grasped the enormity of replacing Burns, even after he became <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> witnessed the show's effect on his own children.

500|$|Henry and {{his reign}} have {{attracted}} historians for many years. In the 18th century the historian David Hume argued that Henry's reign was pivotal {{to creating a}} genuinely English monarchy and, ultimately, a unified Britain. Henry's role in the Becket controversy was considered relatively praiseworthy by Protestant historians of the period, while his disputes with the French king, Louis, also attracted positive patriotic comment. In the Victorian period there was a fresh interest in the personal morality of historical figures and scholars began to express greater concern over aspects of Henry's behaviour, including his role as <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> husband. The king's role {{in the death of}} Becket attracted particular criticism. Late-Victorian historians, with increasing access to the documentary records from the period, stressed Henry's contribution to the evolution of key English institutions, including the development of the law and the exchequer. William Stubbs' analysis led him to label Henry as a [...] "legislator king", responsible for major, long-lasting reforms in England. Influenced by the contemporary growth of the British Empire, historians such as Kate Norgate undertook detailed research into Henry's continental possessions, creating the term [...] "the Angevin Empire" [...] in the 1880s.|$|E
500|$|One core {{theme of}} Lad: A Dog is the obtaining of perfect {{obedience}} {{without the use}} of force. Through the story characters' attempts at explaining Lad's inexplicable actions using [...] "mythologies of atavism", Terhune reflects his own views of an ideal relationship between <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> child, namely an [...] "ideology of noble instinct tempered by inflexible training". An unknown third-person narrator also reflects Terhune's perspective and values regarding violence, which is both repelled and embraced. [...] Reflecting patriarchy and the idea of a living creature that obeys unquestioningly and unhesitatingly, the novel indicates that [...] "perfect obedience and submission to a master's will" [...] can be obtained without needing violence or force. Indeed, Terhune regularly decries the use of physical punishment to gain obedience. For example, in the story [...] "His Little Son", Lad takes over the raising of his son, using an even tempered, rational training system that reflects [...] "discipline and firm kindliness". In the end, Lad is stated to have a stronger, love-based relationship with his son versus that of the pup with his mother, the temperamental Lady. Lady raised their son using physical force to impose her will, and thus after she leaves for a period, she is forgotten by him as he holds no love for her.|$|E
500|$|The double {{burden is}} usually {{view as a}} primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less {{recognized}} that men can and often do {{go through the same}} trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family. Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis, Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, [...] "Social science fails to understand men" [...] by tending [...] "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between work and home for men." [...] Married men can avoid the full impact of the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work. Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor. Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women. However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as a woman does. They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities. Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability be <b>a</b> <b>parent,</b> <b>and</b> they are challenged psychologically. [...] "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents. He has to change the way he feels about himself as man." [...] A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career. A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family. With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.|$|E
