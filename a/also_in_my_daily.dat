40|$|First of all I {{would like}} to thank my advisor Prof. Dr. Mariano Cilia for his {{invaluable}} help and advice. His guidance during my stay at Darmstadt, Germany, was of great importance to me. He did not only introduce me to the distributed systems world, but enormously helped me to prepare for a career in research. Second, I want to thank and express my great appreciation for the support and funding from the Databases and Distributed Systems Group, {{as well as from the}} Technische Universität Darmstadt (TUD). This funding allowed me to visit Germany, a country where technology occupies an important place and is fortunately applied, which enabled me to start my thesis work very motivated. I want to thank the people at the DVS Group, particularly to Alejandro Buchmann, Patric Kabus, Samuel Kounev, Ludger Fiege, Andreas Zeidler, Christian Haul, Matthias Meixner and Marion Braun. They supported me in different ways from getting to know the TU-D to develop very particular aspects of my work. Special thanks go to Mario and José Antollini. They have not only been the best colleagues in the most important parts of the universitary career at the UNICEN, but <b>also</b> big pals <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>daily</b> student life at Tandil during the last years...|$|R

30|$|I’ve been {{resistant}} to use it, {{to be very}} honest, because I don’t know how to incorporate it into my practice. I’ve been doing this homecare nursing for 10  years, and three years as a palliative homecare nurse, and it’s really hard to incorporate an electronic tool to what I’m used to – pen and paper writing and following my gut feelings and emotions as it comes up. I’m more in the moment, versus trying {{to look at the}} data and say, “Oh, it looks like you’ve got some anxiety here. Let’s talk about that,” when that’s already actually incorporated <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>daily</b> assessments [when] I see my patients. So {{a lot of the things}} that are in these tools, I’ve already incorporated <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own way.|$|R
40|$|What is {{the impact}} of {{software}} engineering research on current practices in industry? In this paper, I report on my direct experience as a PhD/post-doc working in software engineering research projects, and then spending the following five years as an engineer in two different companies (the first one being the same I worked in collaboration with during my post-doc). Given a background in software engineering research, what cutting-edge techniques and tools from academia did I use <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>daily</b> work when developing and testing the systems of these companies? Regarding validation and verification (my main area of research), the answer is rather short: as far as I can tell, only FindBugs. In this paper, I report on why this was the case, and discuss all the challenging, complex open problems we face in industry and which somehow are ``neglected'' in the academic circles. In particular, I will first discuss what actual tools I could use <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>daily</b> work, such as JaCoCo and Selenium. Then, I will discuss the main open problems I faced, particularly related to environment simulators, unit and web testing. After that, popular topics in academia are presented, such as UML, regression and mutation testing. Their lack of impact on the type of projects I worked on in industry is then discussed. Finally, from this industrial experience, I provide my opinions about how this situation can be improved, in particular related to how academics are evaluated, and advocate for a greater involvement into open-source projects...|$|R
40|$|I {{have read}} the {{publication}} by Dr Berta Kowalska(1) on the utility of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of postoperative neuropathies, with great interest. When in 2001, a colleague of mine {{told me that he}} could diagnose neuropathies of the upper extremity in an ultrasound examination, I thought it was impossible. I even wondered how ultrasound imaging of the nerve can replace its functional assessment possible thanks to a nerve conduction study (NCS) or electromyography (EMG). In the subsequent years, US imaging was becoming more and more common <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>daily</b> surgical practice. What is more, it even started to supersede other imaging methods, which were, as it would seem, more accurate, such as magnetic resonance imaging...|$|R
60|$|And {{these things}} are true also of nations, but the Gate-keepers who drive the nation to war or anarchy that it may find its Image are {{different}} from those who drive individual men, though I think at times they work together. And as I look backward upon my own writing, I take pleasure alone in those verses where it seems to me I have found something hard, cold, some articulation of the Image, which is the opposite of all that I am <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>daily</b> life, and all that my country is; yet man or nation can no more make Mask or Image than the seed can be made by the soil into which it is cast.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a rapidly growing {{population}} on many college and university campuses today: students equipped with laptop computers capable of wireless connection to the Internet. More and more departments are requiring that students enrolling in certain courses bring laptop computers to class. The course instructor is some times overwhelmed by the prospect, asking How should I change <b>my</b> lesson plan <b>in</b> order to integrate the laptop <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>daily</b> lecture? This paper first describes the effort to bring the laptop to campus {{at a number of}} colleges and universities around the country. It then offers concrete suggestions based on the experiences of several professors who either have taught, or are now teaching, laptoprequired courses. The paper concludes with a summary and a look toward the future. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} my first‐hand {{experiences}} {{of being a}} ‘purist’ in Hong Kong, during which time I {{was not allowed to}} use mixed code, a common discursive practice among Hongkongers in Hong Kong. I shall discuss the difficulties in using ‘pure’ English and ‘pure’ Chinese <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>daily</b> life, as well as exploring the problems I encountered when I used ‘pure’ English in teaching English to a small group of ESL students at a primary school in Hong Kong. I argue that mixed code is very much characteristic of everyday language use by most Hongkongers and represents an important marker of their ethno‐linguistic identity. In relation to language teaching, I suggest that mixed code may be usefully adopted in teaching English in Hong Kong, rather than being shunned at all costs...|$|R
5000|$|But it's not {{a secret}} {{in the sense}} that [...] "I'm about to {{disclose}} something you didn't know!" [...] Instead, it could be about [...] "me" [...] <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>daily</b> life, or it could be about you… Everyone keeps secrets; there is not one person on this planet who does not have at least one secret, nor is there a person who can tell others everything about him or herself. Even when you try to understand others (or to have a mutual understanding with others), there is always a [...] "you" [...] that only you know about. I have aspects that only certain people know about and aspects that everyone knows about. That's what I call a secret. And in this sense, there are secrets incorporated into this album.|$|R
60|$|To-night, to-night, {{when this}} tranquillity and calm are on my spirits, and memory {{presents}} so many shifting scenes before me, I take my quiet stand at will by many {{a fire that}} has been long extinguished, and mingle with the cheerful group that cluster round it. If I could be sorrowful in such a mood, I should grow sad to think what a poor blot I was upon their youth and beauty once, and now how few remain to put me to the blush; I should grow sad to think that such among them as I sometimes meet with <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>daily</b> walks are scarcely less infirm than I; that time has brought us to a level; and that all distinctions fade and vanish as we take our trembling steps towards the grave.|$|R
6000|$|In another remonstrance he thus expresses himself. [...] "The {{affairs of}} this world are unstable, and soon pass away: it would {{therefore}} be incumbent on the English gentlemen to show some friendship for me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> necessities,--I, who have always exerted <b>my</b> very life <b>in</b> {{the service of the}} English, assigned over to them all the resources left <b>in</b> <b>my</b> country, stopped my very household expenses, together with the jaghires of my servants and dependants, to the amount of 98,98,375 rupees. Besides this, as to the jaghires of my grandmother, mother, and uncle, which were granted to them for their support, agreeable to engagements, you are the masters,--if the Council have sent orders for the stopping their jaghires also, stop them. I have no resources left <b>in</b> <b>my</b> country, and have no friends by me, being even distressed <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>daily</b> subsistence. I have some elephants, horses, and the houses which I inhabit: if they can be of any service to my friends, they are ready. Whenever you can discover any resources, seize upon them: I shall not interfere to prevent you. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> present distress for <b>my</b> <b>daily</b> expenses, I was in hopes that they would have excused some part of my debt. Of what use is it for me to relate my situation, which is known to the whole world? This much is sufficient." ...|$|R
