What we <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>saying</b> is that the general mental climate itself has, outside of the domain of physical science, ceased to be invigorating; that, on the contrary, it fosters the more inglorious predispositions of men, and encourages a native willingness, already so strong, to acquiesce in a lazy accommodation with error, an ignoble economy of truth, and a vicious compromise of the permanent gains of adhering to a sound general principle, {{for the sake of the}} temporary gains of departing from it.|$|E

5000|$|The Anglo-Saxon mission {{began in}} {{the last decade of the}} 7th century in Frisia, whence, Saint Boniface {{reminded}} the monks he urged to come to the continental missions, their forebears had come: [...] "Take pity on them, for they themselves <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>saying,</b> 'We are of one blood and one bone with you.'" [...] The missions, which drew down the energy and initiative of the English church, spread south and east from there. Almost immediately the Anglo-Saxon missionaries came in contact with the Pippinids, the new dominant family in Frankish territories. The earliest monastery founded by Anglo-Saxons on the continent is Willibrord's Abbey of Echternach (698), founded at a villa granted him by a daughter of Dagobert II. Pepin II, who wished to extend his influence in the Low Countries, granted free passage to Rome to Willibrord, to be consecrated Bishop of Frisia; Norman F. Cantor singles this out as the first joint project between Carolingians and the Papacy: [...] "It set the pattern for their increasing association in the first half of the 8th century as a result of their joint support of the efforts of the Anglo-Saxon missionaries." ...|$|E

As for the {{industrial}} companies, {{many of them}} who used to have contractual links with some developer teams in the universities <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>saying</b> that {{they are interested in}} the project {{from the point of view}} of being able to participate in larger projects the future, which could not have been approved by the corporate management before. Still, there are many problems with the state projects and money, as the rules and the priorities of the game can change very fast both for major corporations and, largely, for the state corporations. The seemingly generous disposition of the government has turned out to be less beneficial than was originally thought. For example, ‘If before the money started coming from the moment the contract between the federation and the company was signed, now the money does not come - the company has to invest their own money and later the federation can return something if they think it necessary. Perhaps, if the terms of the competition had been announced at the beginning of 2014 the situation would not have been so bad, but it was announced in the second half of October when all the financial plans of the company had already been drafted. Naturally, nobody knew that the rules would change but they had been advised about the competition and the company had committed; providing funding with its own money for the project in the same way as before. The rules of the game changed and the finance plans had been already approved by everybody up to, say, the headquarters of the corporate structure, so nothing could be changed. In this scenario the winners are, let’s say, private companies. That is the companies not belonging to a corporation’n.|$|E
40|$|Industrial Ecology (IE) is {{a systems}} {{approach}} to efficient resource use {{and protection of}} the environment. Instead of just devising improved methods of waste treatment and disposal, we look for the best opportunities to reduce waste throughout the total material cycle from virgin materials to finished products to end of product life. Instead of controlling industrial pollutants from different sources one by one at different times and with different technologies, we try to look across whole facilities, regions and even whole industries and make changes wherever in the system it is most effective to do so. Many thoughtful observers in the research and private and public sectors <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>saying</b> that IE approaches are our best {{and in some cases}} our only opportunities to bring about further significant environmental improvement. They conclude that tinkering with the present approach is not enough. EPAs programs should seek the most effective places to improve resource efficiency and product stewardship with incentives, information and regulatory flexibility. EPA should encourage more facilities to emulate those that have voluntarily become much more resource efficient where it is already profitable. They also conclude that due to knowledge gaps and disincentives, this effort will require coordinated government action and that EPA should play a major leadership role. Staff from around EPA have been considering this suggestion. They firmly envision that Industrial Ecology approaches should guide and supplement but not replace current regulatory programs. They have also found that there is a base of EPA activity and program ideas on which to build. This paper recommends five steps to get started, each of which can be done under current laws: (1) Familiarize key groups with the concept of IE. (2) Lay the data/information foundation for IE. (3) Ask each headquarters and regional office to make appropriate commitments to pursue IE approaches. (4) Work with other agencies of federal, state and local government, as well as foreign governments and organizations outside of government. (5) Set specific goals and expectations and measure progress. US Environmental Protection Agenc...|$|E
