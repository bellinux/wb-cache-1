The degree of cooking {{corresponds}} to {{the temperature in the}} approximate center of the meat, which can be measured with <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Beef can be cooked using the sous-vide method, which cooks the entire steak to the same temperature, but when cooked using a method such as broiling or roasting it is typically cooked such that it has a [...] "bulls eye" [...] of doneness, with the least done (coolest) at the center and the most done (warmest) at the outside.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> 2012 chicken <b>meat</b> {{study found}} 60% of home cooks {{were at risk}} of food {{poisoning}} by washing whole poultry before it was cooked, which can spread bacteria around the kitchen.

50|$|The {{best way}} to prevent {{trichinellosis}} is to fully cook <b>meat.</b> <b>A</b> food <b>thermometer</b> can verify that the temperature inside the meat is high enough. Infection is typically treated with antiparasitic medication such as albendazole or mebendazole. Rapid treatment may kill adult worms and thereby stop further worsening of symptoms. Both medications are considered safe but {{have been associated with}} side effects such as bone marrow suppression. Their use during pregnancy or in {{children under the age of}} 2 years is poorly studied but appears to be safe. Treatment with steroids is sometimes also required in severe cases. Without treatment symptoms typically resolve within three months.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Meat</b> <b>thermometers</b> {{are usually}} {{designed}} {{to have the}} probe in the meat during cooking. Some use a bimetallic strip which rotates a needle which shows the temperature on a dial; the whole thermometer can be left inside the oven during cooking.

50|$|Thermometers are {{important}} in food safety where food at temperatures within 41 and 135 F can be prone to potentially harmful levels of bacterial growth after several hours {{which could lead to}} foodborne illness. This includes monitoring refrigeration temperatures and maintaining temperatures in foods being served under heat lamps or hot water baths.Cooking thermometers {{are important}} for determining if a food is properly cooked. In particular <b>meat</b> <b>thermometers</b> are used to aid in cooking <b>meat</b> to <b>a</b> safe internal temperature while preventing over cooking. They are commonly found using either a bimetallic coil, or a thermocouple or thermistor with a digital readout.Candy thermometers are used to aid in achieving a specific water content in a sugar solution based on its boiling temperature.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer</b> is a unit {{which will}} measure core {{temperature}} of meats while cooking.

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>meat</b> <b>{{thermometer}}</b> or cooking thermometer is {{a thermometer}} {{used to measure}} the internal temperature of meat, especially roasts and steaks, and other cooked foods. The degree of [...] "doneness" [...] of meat or bread correlates closely with the internal temperature, so that a thermometer reading indicates when it is cooked as desired. When cooking, food should always be cooked so that the interior reaches a temperature sufficient, {{that in the case of}} meat is enough to kill pathogens that may cause foodborne illness or, in the case of bread, that is done baking; the thermometer helps to ensure this.|$|E

Five years later, Edie is having a party with her friends Johnny, Eva, Colin, Liz and Shane in her house. Colin puts on the same mask as Edie's mother's killer and scares Edie. This causes her to have a psychotic break and stab him {{to death with a}} kitchen knife. She then hacks Liz to death with a cleaver, stabs Shane in the neck with <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer,</b> and bludgeons Johnny with a frying pan. She then advances menacingly towards Eva, but Eva coaxes Edie out of her psychotic episode. However, a still living Johnny then appears and smashes a block of ice on Eva's head.

However, just as Johnny is about to leave the house, a dying Eva beats him to death with two frying pans before collapsing on the floor.|$|E
50|$|Upon waking, Chad and Scarlet {{discover}} that Sam and Lilith intend to torture and kill them. They nearly drown Scarlet in a barrel, but {{after they leave}} the room Chad resuscitates her, and the couple tries to flee the farmhouse. Chad is caught by Lilith, but wrestles away a shotgun from her and knocks her unconscious. Scarlet, aided by Alal, runs away into a vineyard field, but is eventually caught by Sam, who kills Alal and takes Scarlet back into the house. While Sam goes to look for Chad, Lilith tortures Scarlet by scraping the flesh off her knees with a grater. Chad interrupts the torture session and kills Lilith by stabbing her {{in the head with}} <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Chad tries to set Scarlet free, but is unable to do so before Sam gets back. Chad and Sam fight, and Scarlet stabs Sam in the back with a chef's knife.

40|$|A hand injury {{occurred}} at a U. S. facility in 1985 involving a pointed shaft (similar to <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer)</b> that a worker was using to remove scrap solid plutonium from a plastic bottle. The worker punctured his right index finger on the palm side at the metacarpal-phalangeal joint. The wound was not through-and- through, although it was deep. The puncture wound resulted in deposition of ~ 48 kBq of alpha activity from the weapons-grade plutonium mixture with a nominal 12 to 1 Pu-alpha to {sup 241 }Am-alpha ratio. This case clearly showed that DTPA was very effective for decorporation of plutonium and americium. The case is a model for management of wounds contaminated with transuranics: (1) a team approach for dealing {{with all of the}} issues surrounding the incident, including the psychological, (2) early surgical intervention for foreign-body removal, (3) wound irrigation with DTPA solution, and (4) early and prolonged DTPA administration based upon bioassay and in vivo dosimetry...|$|E
40|$|Field {{procedures}} for collecting soil cores and soil {{samples from the}} steam injection plot were modified {{in an effort to}} minimize VOC losses that can occur when sampling soil at elevated temperatures (Battelle, 2001). The primary modifications included: (1) additional personnel safety equipment, such as thermalinsulated gloves for core handling; (2) the addition of a cooling period to bring the soil cores to approximately 20 ºC before collecting samples; and (3) capping the core ends while the cores were cooling. Concerns were raised about the possibility that increased handling times during soil coring, soil cooling, and sample collection may result in an increase in VOC losses. An experiment was conducted using soil samples spiked with a surrogate compound to investigate the effectiveness of the field procedures developed for LC 34 in minimizing VOC losses. Materials and Methods Soil cores were collected in a 2 -inch diameter, 4 -foot long acetate sleeve that was placed tightly inside a 2 -inch diameter stainless steel core barrel. The acetate sleeve was immediately capped on both ends with a protective polymer covering. The sleeve was placed in an ice bath to cool the heated core to below ambient groundwater temperatures (approximately 20 ºC). The temperature of the soil core was monitored during the cooling process with <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer</b> that was pushed into one end cap (see Figure G- 1). Approximately 30 minutes was required to cool each 4 -foot long, 2 -inch diameter soil core from 50 - 95 ºC to below 20 ºC (see Figure G- 2). Upon reaching ambient temperature, the core sleeve was then uncapped and cut open along its length to collect the soil sample for contaminant analysis (see Figure G- 3) ...|$|E
