40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was an {{assessment}} of the understanding of the concepts of <b>agricultural</b> awareness <b>and</b> <b>agricultural</b> literacy as perceived by agricultural education teachers. The purpose {{of this study was}} to identify perceptions of agriculture teachers regarding the understanding of the concepts of <b>agricultural</b> awareness <b>and</b> <b>agricultural</b> literacy in the study of agriculture in the state of Iowa. To also develop consensus definitions of <b>agricultural</b> awareness <b>and</b> <b>agricultural</b> literacy. Data provide information for development of a framework for education in and about agriculture and the life sciences. We can conclude from the study there is no consensus definition for <b>agricultural</b> awareness <b>and</b> <b>agricultural</b> literacy among agricultural educator teachers in Iowa. Since there is not a consensus definition for <b>agricultural</b> awareness <b>and</b> <b>agricultural</b> literacy, there is not a clear understanding of the two definitions. There needs to be consensus definition of <b>agricultural</b> awareness <b>and</b> <b>agricultural</b> literacy taught to agricultural educators at the collegiate level. There needs to be a consensus definition of <b>agricultural</b> awareness <b>and</b> <b>agricultural</b> literacy taught in the elementary, middle and high school, <b>and</b> <b>agricultural</b> programs such as FFA, 4 H, <b>and</b> <b>agricultural</b> fairs. It is recommended that the <b>Agricultural</b> Awareness <b>and</b> Literacy Framework Model that was developed in 2008, should be used in both formal and non-formal educational settings. The course curricula at a formal educational institution can be designed in such ways that they impart the interest in agriculture at the elementary level and knowledge and expertise at high school and post-secondary levels, respectively. If knowledge is imparted by the time students leave the high school, they can make informed decisions regarding careers and their concerns about food and their environment...|$|R

5|$|Economic {{globalization}} grew under free trade, {{starting in}} 1860 when the United Kingdom {{entered into a}} free trade agreement with France known as the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty. However, the golden age of this wave of globalization endured a return to protectionism between 1880 and 1914. In 1879, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced protective tariffs on <b>agricultural</b> <b>and</b> manufacturing goods, making Germany the first nation to institute new protective trade policies. In 1892, France introduced the Méline tariff, greatly raising customs duties on both <b>agricultural</b> <b>and</b> manufacturing goods. The United States maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century, imposing customs duties between 40 and 50% on imported goods. Despite these measures, international trade continued to grow without slowing. Paradoxically, foreign trade grew at a much faster rate during the protectionist phase of the first wave of globalization than during the free trade phase sparked by the United Kingdom.|$|E
