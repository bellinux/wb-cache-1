Musically, {{the record is}} a pop album that incorporates elements of dance-pop, synthpop, and various EDM sub-genres. Lyrically, it delves into themes of love, relationships and femininity. Majority of the numbers consists of synthesizers, drum machines, electric and acoustic guitars, and keyboards, whilst it was the group's first experimentation with tools such as <b>autotune</b> and vocoder.|$|E

However, programmers must prepare applications for <b>autotuning,</b> which is tedious and error prone coding work. We demonstrate how applications become ready for <b>autotuning</b> with few or no modifications by extending Threading Building Blocks (TBB), a library for parallel programming, with <b>autotuning.</b> The extended TBB library optimizes all application-independent tuning parameters fully automatically. We compare manual effort, <b>autotuning</b> overhead and performance gains on 17 examples. While some examples benefit only slightly, others speed up by 28 % over standard TBB.

The album's piano and guitar-driven ballads such as [...] "Love Into The Light", [...] "Wonderland" [...] and [...] "Past Lives" [...] display Kesha's vocal ability. Kesha also uses a trademark talky [...] "white-girl" [...] rapping style with exaggerated discordant phrasing and enunciation. Her vocal technique has led her to be credited as a rapper, a topic she disagreed with until fellow rappers André 3000, Wiz Khalifa, and Snoop Dogg endorsed her. On the subject, she said: [...] "The first time someone called me a rapper, I started laughing. I was shocked, and thought it was hilarious. It's crazy and funny to me." [...] The New York Times said Kesha [...] "threatens to become the most influential female rapper of the day, or at least the most popular. Pretending Kesha isn't a rapper is no longer feasible." [...] "Crazy Kids" [...] and [...] "C'Mon" [...] took greater shifts into [...] "party rap". Most of her lyrics chronicle her relationships and partying; the lighthearted subject matter of the latter and her unfiltered language saw many critics criticizing her for releasing frivolous and crass music. Jonah Weiner of Slate, however, stated that her jarring lyrics allowed her songs to become more memorable. In [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] and [...] "Boots & Boys", she objectifies men to poke fun at how male fronted rock bands and rappers can get away with objectifying women and not vice versa. The title track to her debut, [...] "Animal", is more aspirational and is intended to inspire people to embrace their individuality. Much more experimental than Animal, her second album, Warrior, contains dubstep elements and explores erotic experiences Kesha encountered with ghosts on the song [...] "Supernatural". Overall, Kesha said the theme of Warrior is magic.|$|E

Erlewine was somewhat critical of the choice to release the EP noting that the only real reason for the release was that Animal had been [...] "squeezed dry of hits". Although critical of the re-release, Thomas' consensus of the album was positive, writing: [...] "aided by the tight focus of an eight-track EP, Cannibal’s brevity trumping the scattershot Animal -- but what makes them stick is Kesha, a pop star lacking pop star looks and a pop star voice. She’s all ravenous id, spitting at strangers and backstabbing friends, humiliating hotties, and laughing at the wreckage in her wake. She is who she is and she offers no apologies." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented on Kesha's writing of the album noting that her [...] "herky-jerky rhymes still sound like {{they came from the}} bathroom wall of a reform-school kindergarten", not citing that as a negative but instead noting that the album had a [...] "sulfurous end-of-days whiff about it". Greenblatt ended her review of the album giving it a rating of [...] "B+" [...] and called [...] "Sleazy" [...] and [...] "Blow" [...] the standout tracks on the album. Will Hermes from Rolling Stone noted that Kesha's main pop competitor was Lady Gaga writing, [...] "This EP proves Kesha would kick Gaga's ass in a freestyle battle" [...] praising her rhyming and production by Dr. Luke calling Kesha the [...] "snap queen of clubland." [...] Chad Grischow from IGN met the album with a positive review, giving the album a score of 6.5 out of 10. Grischow was critical of the production of the album and overuse of Auto-Tune writing that there was [...] "so much overdubbing and <b>autotune</b> used that most of the songs may as well be sung by a spunky robot". He also noted that when Kesha's vocals were stripped down she could actually sing, highlighting the ballads [...] "The Harold Song" [...] and [...] "C U Next Tuesday" [...] in the album's review. Grischow ended his review writing, [...] "Cannibal proves to be too mired in mindless lyrics and excessive vocal effects to have any lasting appeal." ...|$|E
