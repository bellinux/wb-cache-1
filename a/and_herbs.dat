5|$|Columbian mammoths {{inhabited}} the southern half of North America, {{ranging from the}} northern United States across Mexico {{as far south as}} Costa Rica. One Costa Rican specimen, a molar, was reported in 1963 but has since been lost. The environment in these areas may have had more varied habitats than those inhabited by woolly mammoths in the north (the mammoth steppe). Some areas were covered by grass, herbaceous plants, trees and shrubs; their composition varied from region to region, and included grassland, savanna and aspen parkland habitats. There were also wooded areas; although mammoths would not have preferred forests, clearings could provide them with grass <b>and</b> <b>herbs.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} a threatened species in the Åland Islands of Finland. A study of the species' distribution in Sweden reported that in the 1940s and 50s, it grew in beech woods with broad-leaved grasses <b>and</b> <b>herbs</b> in topsoils with soil pH levels between 5.0 and 6.6, but the populations have since decreased owing to soil acidification during the last several decades.

5|$|The {{earliest}} cottage gardens {{were more}} practical than today's, {{with emphasis on}} vegetables <b>and</b> <b>herbs,</b> fruit trees, perhaps a beehive, and even livestock. Flowers, used to fill spaces, gradually became more dominant. The traditional cottage garden was usually enclosed, perhaps with a rose-bowered gateway. Flowers common to early cottage gardens included traditional florists' flowers such as primroses and violets, along with flowers with household use such as calendula and various herbs. Others were the richly scented old-fashioned roses that bloomed once a year, and simple flowers like daisies. In time, cottage-garden sections were added to some large estate gardens as well.|$|E

5|$|At Horseshoe Bend, Shirehampton {{the wooded}} cliff and a narrow salt marsh are {{supported}} by rocks of Devonian sandstone and Carboniferous limestone, overlain by with Triassic Dolomitic conglomerate. The site's principal interest {{and the reason for}} its designation as an SSSI is the presence of a population of the True Service-tree (Sorbus domestica) growing on the cliffs. This tree is nationally rare in Britain, and this site hosts the largest known population in England. Other notable species of Sorbus here are the whitebeams Sorbus eminens and Sorbus anglica, both of which are also nationally rare in Britain. The nationally scarce Large-leaved Lime (Tilia platyphyllos) also occurs, <b>and</b> <b>herbs</b> include Field garlic (Allium oleraceum) and Pale St. John's-wort (Hypericum montanum). The saltmarsh vegetation, which lies {{at the base of the}} cliff, is predominantly made up of Sea Aster (Aster tripolium) and English Scurvygrass (Cochlearia anglica). There are however two nationally scarce vascular plant species here as well– Slender Hare's-ear (Bupleurum tenuissimum) and Long-stalked Orache (Atriplex longipes).|$|E

5|$|The 1980s were a {{formative}} decade: {{the increased}} optimism after {{the signing of}} the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, the economic recovery of the mid-1980s and the increasing travel abroad by average citizens were factors contributing to a greater interest in food and wine. In addition, high quality, locally produced ingredients became increasingly available. For example, privately owned dairies began to produce handmade cheeses from goat, sheep and cow’s milk, which quickly became very popular both among chefs and the general public. In 1983, the Golan Heights Winery was the first of many new Israeli winemakers to help transform tastes with their production of world-class, semi-dry and dry wines. New attention was paid to the making of handmade breads and the production of high quality olive oil. The successful development of aquaculture ensured a steady supply of fresh fish, and the agricultural revolution in Israel led to an overwhelming choice and quality of fresh fruit, vegetables <b>and</b> <b>herbs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day). The animals band {{together}} in three distinct kinds of groups: {{one or two}} females with young calves, three to six adult and yearling females with calves, and all-male groups with two to 18 members. Typically tame, the nilgai may appear timid and cautious if harassed or alarmed; it flees up to -or even , galloping away from the source of danger. Herbivores, nilgai prefer grasses <b>and</b> <b>herbs,</b> though they commonly eat woody plants in the dry tropical forests of India. Females become sexually mature by two years, while males do not become sexually active until {{four or five years}} old. The time of the year when mating takes place varies geographically, but a peak breeding season lasting three to four months can be observed at most places. Gestation lasts eight to nine months, following which a single calf (sometimes twins or even triplets) is born. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves stay hidden for the first few weeks of their lives. The lifespan of the nilgai is around ten years.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is an area}} of rich highveld and montane {{grassland}} flora. It {{has more}} than sixty grass species and a large variety of bulbs <b>and</b> <b>herbs.</b> Each of these species has its own flowering time, meaning that veld flowers can be seen throughout the summer. The park also has Afromontane forests and high-altitude Austro-Afro alpine grassland, which is scarce in South Africa. The ouhout (Leucosidea sericea), an evergreen species, is the most common tree in the park. Ouhout is a favourite habitat of beetles and 117 species occur on these trees in the park. The Lombardi poplars and weeping willows in the park are introduced species, but are kept because of their cultural and historic connection with the eastern Free State. Other exotic species in the park, for example wattle and bluegum, are systematically eradicated.|$|E

40|$|UNLABELLED: We {{quantified}} {{the impact}} of 60 -day head-down bed rest (HDBR) with countermeasures on arterial and venous response to tilt. METHODS: Twenty-one males: 7 control (Con), 7 resistive vibration exercise (RVE) <b>and</b> 7 Chinese <b>herb</b> (Herb) were assessed. Subjects were identified as finisher (F) or non-finishers (NF) at the post-HDBR 20 -min tilt test. The cerebral (MCA), femoral (FEM) arterial flow velocity and leg vascular resistance (FRI), the portal vein section (PV), the flow redistribution ratios (MCA/FEM; MCA/PV), the tibial (Tib), gastrocnemius (Gast), and saphenous (Saph) vein sections were measured by echography and Doppler ultrasonography. Arterial and venous parameters were measured at 3 -min pre-tilt in the supine position, and at 1 min {{before the end of}} the tilt. RESULTS: At post-HDBR tilt, MCA decreased more compared with pre-HDBR tilt in the Con, RVE, <b>and</b> <b>Herb</b> groups, the MCA/FEM tended to decrease in the Con <b>and</b> <b>Herb</b> groups (not significant) but remained stable in the RVE gr. FRI dropped in the Con gr, but remained stable in the <b>Herb</b> gr <b>and</b> increased in the RVE gr. PV decreased less in the Con <b>and</b> <b>Herb</b> groups but remained unchanged in the RVE gr. MCA/PV decreased in the Con <b>and</b> <b>Herb</b> groups, but increased to a similar extent in the RVE gr. Gast section significantly increased more in the Con gr only, whereas Tib section increased more in the Con <b>and</b> <b>Herb</b> groups but not in the RVE gr. The percent change in Saph section was similar at pre- and post-HDBR tilt. CONCLUSION: In the Con gr, vasoconstriction was reduced in leg and splanchnic areas. RVE <b>and</b> <b>Herb</b> contributed to prevent the loss of vasoconstriction in both areas, but the effect of RVE was higher.
