[...] Although his teachers [...] "not unfrequently turned me off {{with little or no}} attention, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> too stupid to learn and too dull to feel neglect," [...] Strang recalled that he spent [...] "long weary days... upon the floor, thinking, thinking, thinking... my mind wandered over fields that old men shrink from, seeking rest and finding none till darkness gathered thick around and I burst into tears." [...] He studied works by Thomas Paine and the Comte de Volney, whose book Les Ruines exerted a significant influence on the future prophet.|$|E
500|$|During free {{practice}} on Friday and Saturday, it was Lewis Hamilton and McLaren {{who set the}} pace, closely followed by championship contender Vettel and his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber. While Hamilton topped the time sheets in both Friday sessions, Jenson Button was quickest during the third session on Saturday morning. Fernando Alonso had a difficult first free practice, trailing Vettel by 0.465 seconds, {{twice as much as}} in previous races. However, he was able to lap faster than the German on the harder compound tyres in the second session. Ferrari looked stronger during the long run trials with Felipe Massa putting in the most consistently fast lap times, 0.1 seconds ahead of Hamilton. With high temperatures, tyre degradation was a concern for the teams in the paddock with Hamilton commenting that [...] "it felt almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sliding around the track with the tyres melting".|$|E

2500|$|Jeff Cork from Game Informer {{scored the}} game an 8/10, saying: [...] "Creation and {{discovery}} are at Tearaways foundation, and I was still pleasantly {{surprised at the}} steady drip of new abilities, gameplay elements, and other novelties delivered throughout. Not everything lands, but the parts that do are outstanding. One thing did seem {{to get lost in}} the move to PS4, though: Tearaway on Vita was an intimate experience. Holding the device close to my face, it felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> privy to a secret directly from Media Molecule. I’m glad to see the adventure on the big screen, but the console experience feels less personal, and the journey loses {{a little bit in the}} transition. That said, Tearaway Unfolded is still a great game for families or anyone else who’s looking for an uplifting change of pace." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kerouac was {{demoralized}} by {{criticism of}} Dharma Bums from such respected {{figures in the}} American field of Buddhism as Zen teachers Ruth Fuller Sasaki and Alan Watts. [...] He wrote to Snyder, referring to a meeting with D. T. Suzuki, that [...] "even Suzuki {{was looking at me}} through slitted eyes <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a monstrous imposter." [...] He passed up the opportunity to reunite with Snyder in California, and explained to Philip Whalen, [...] "I'd be ashamed to confront you and Gary now I've become so decadent and drunk and don't give a shit. [...] I'm not a Buddhist any more." [...] In further reaction to their criticism, he quoted part of Abe Green's cafe recitation, Thrasonical Yawning in the Abattoir of the Soul: [...] "A gaping, rabid congregation, eager to bathe, are washed over by the Font of Euphoria, and bask like protozoans in the celebrated light." [...] Many consider that this clearly indicated Kerouac's journey on an emotional roller coaster of unprecedented adulation and spiritual demoralization.|$|E
2500|$|Morton's {{claim to}} have invented jazz in 1902 aroused resentment. The jazz historian, musician, and {{composer}} Gunther Schuller says of Morton's [...] "hyperbolic assertions" [...] that there is [...] "no proof to the contrary" [...] and that Morton's [...] "considerable accomplishments in themselves provide reasonable substantiation". Alan Lomax, who recorded extensive biographical interviews of Morton at the Library of Congress in 1938, did not agree that Morton was an egoist: In being called a supreme egotist, Jelly Roll was often a victim of loose and lurid reporting. If we read the words that he himself wrote, we learn that he almost had an inferiority complex {{and said that he}} created is own style of jazz piano because [...] "All my fellow musicians were much faster in manipulations, I thought than I, and I did not feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in their class." [...] So he used a slower tempo to permit flexibility through the use of more notes, a pinch of Spanish to give a number of right seasoning, the avoidance of playing triple forte continuously, and many other points". --Quoted in John Szwed, Dr Jazz.|$|E
2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night I went to bed early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy because I had a row with my mother and very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is {{at the back of my}} mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't you? And I do hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|E
