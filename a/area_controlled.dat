5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of North Vietnam's period of recuperation in 1974, President Thiệu stretched his forces thin by launching offensives that retook {{most of the}} territory captured by PAVN forces during the land grab of 1973 and 15 {{percent of the total}} land <b>area</b> <b>controlled</b> by the communists {{at the time of the}} cease-fire. In April, Thiệu launched the Svay Rieng Campaign against communist strongholds in eastern Cambodia. This proved to be the last major offensive operation launched by the ARVN.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1861, Johnson tried mightily to assert the {{legitimacy}} of the fledgling government, but to no avail. Its jurisdiction extended only as far as the <b>area</b> <b>controlled</b> by the Confederate Army. Johnson came woefully short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress in Richmond. Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens to turn over their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful. On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested a sum of $3million from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses. The Congress instead approved a sum of $2million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin and President Davis.|$|E
5|$|Like most of {{this part}} of Borneo, this area was once {{under the control of the}} Bruneian Empire in the 15th century before being ceded to the Sultanate of Sulu between the 17th and 18th centuries as a gift for helping the Bruneian forces during a civil war in Brunei. The name Tawao was used on {{nautical}} charts by 1857, and there is evidence of a settlement by 1879. The East India Company had established a trading post in Borneo, though there was no significant activity by the Dutch on the east coast. In 1846, Netherlands signed a treaty with the Sultan of Bulungan, where the latter assured the Dutch control of the area. When the Dutch began to operate in 1867, the Sultan married his son to the daughter of the Sultan of Tarakan. Around this time, the Dutch sphere of influence reached Tawao. They controlled the area north of Tawao, overlapping an <b>area</b> <b>controlled</b> by the Sultan of Sulu.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is {{inferential}} and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin {{was born in the}} <b>area</b> <b>controlled</b> by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.|$|E
5|$|By April 1943, Western <b>Area</b> <b>controlled</b> four combat units: No.14 Squadron, flying Bristol Beaufort reconnaissance-bombers out of Pearce; No.25 Squadron, {{tasked with}} dive-bombing {{missions}} in Wirraways based at Pearce; No.76 Squadron, flying P-40 Kittyhawks out of Potshot (Exmouth Gulf); and No.85 Squadron, operating CAC Boomerang fighters from Pearce. The area command was {{also able to}} call on US Navy Catalinas of Patrol Wing10, based at Crawley, for reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions. The Beauforts and Catalinas flew several hundred maritime patrols during 1943. In March 1944, Western Area went on high alert in response to concerns that a Japanese naval force would raid Western Australia. Perth was reinforced with Nos.452 and 457 Squadrons, and Exmouth Gulf with Nos.18, 31, and 120 Squadrons, but no attack ensued and the units were directed {{to return to their}} home bases. The US Navy withdrew Patrol Wing10 mid-year, curtailing Western Area's ability to conduct long-range maritime reconnaissance; No.14 Squadron's fifteen serviceable Beauforts had to fly patrols of up to twenty-two hours in duration to search for German submarines reported in the area. As of 31May 1944, Western Area headquarters staff numbered 686, including 118 officers.|$|E
5|$|These threats {{may have}} speeded {{a long term}} process of gaelicisation of the Pictish kingdoms, which adopted Gaelic {{language}} and customs. There was also a merger of the Gaelic and Pictish crowns, although historians debate {{whether it was a}} Pictish takeover of Dál Riata, or the other way around. This culminated in the rise of Cínaed mac Ailpín (Kenneth MacAlpin) in the 840s, which brought to power the House of Alpin. In AD 867 the Vikings seized Northumbria, forming the Kingdom of York; three years later they stormed the Britons' fortress of Dumbarton and subsequently conquered much of England except for a reduced Kingdom of Wessex, leaving the new combined Pictish and Gaelic kingdom almost encircled. When he died as king of the combined kingdom in 900, Domnall II (Donald II) was the first man to be called rí Alban (i.e. King of Alba). The term Scotia would be increasingly be used to describe the kingdom between North of the Forth and Clyde and eventually the entire <b>area</b> <b>controlled</b> by its kings would be referred to as Scotland.|$|E

25|$|During the 17th century, Hungary {{was divided}} into three parts: an <b>area</b> <b>controlled</b> by the Turks; an <b>area</b> <b>controlled</b> by the Habsburgs; and Transylvania. Historic songs {{declined}} in popularity and were replaced by lyrical poetry, whilst minstrels were replaced by court musicians. Many courts or households maintained large ensembles of musicians who played the trumpet, whistle, cimbalom, violin or bagpipes. Some of these ensemble musicians were German, Polish, French or Italian; the court of Gábor Bethlen, Prince of Transylvania, included a Spanish guitarist. Little detail about the music played during this era survives, however. Musical life in the areas controlled by the Ottoman Turks declined precipitously, with even the formerly widespread and entrenched plainsong style disappearing {{by the end of}} the 17th century. Outside of the Ottoman area, however, plainsong flourished after the establishment of Protestant missions in around 1540, while a similarly styled form of folk song called verse chronicles also arose.|$|E
