He helped bring the issues of the national debt and the national deficit into the national policy debate. Ryan subscribes to supply-side economics. His positions on fiscal policy have included tax cuts, cuts to entitlement programs, freezes on discretionary spending, the elimination of automatic inflation increases in calculating budget baselines, deregulation, and the privatization of social security, Medicare, Medicaid, and education.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the witches}} do not {{deliberately}} tell Macbeth to kill King Duncan, {{they use a}} subtle form of temptation when they inform Macbeth that he is destined to be king. By placing this thought in his mind, they effectively guide him {{on the path to}} his own destruction. This follows the pattern of temptation attributed to the Devil in the contemporary imagination: the Devil was believed to be <b>a</b> <b>thought</b> in a person's mind, which he or she might either indulge or reject. Macbeth indulges the temptation, while Banquo rejects it.|$|E
5|$|A {{biography}} by Galileo's pupil Vincenzo Viviani {{stated that}} Galileo had dropped balls {{of the same}} material, but different masses, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass. This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, {{in direct proportion to}} weight. While this story has been retold in popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most <b>a</b> <b>thought</b> experiment which did not actually take place. An exception is Drake, who argues that the experiment did take place, more or less as Viviani described it. The experiment described was actually performed by Simon Stevin (commonly known as Stevinus) and Jan Cornets de Groot, although the building used was actually the church tower in Delft in 1586. However, most of his experiments with falling bodies were carried out using inclined planes where both the issues of timing and air resistance were much reduced.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>thought</b> {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E

If the player can find a character or object with a Kinstone piece (indicated by <b>a</b> <b>thought</b> bubble above their heads), the player can try to fuse their Kinstone piece with one of their own to make a match. If a successful fusion is made, something will occur somewhere within the game's world, including the placement of treasure chests, access to secret areas and certain events which occur among certain characters. Whilst many Kinstone fusions are optional, some fusions, such as those which use Golden Kinstones, are necessary to advance the story.|$|E
