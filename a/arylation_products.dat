40|$|ABSTRACT: A base-promoted formal arylation of benzo[d]-oxazoles with acyl {{chloride}} was achieved in moderate to good yields.

First, we show that secondary alkyl bromides can undergo in situ conversion into alkyl zinc bromides and regioconvergent Negishi coupling with aryl or alkenyl triflates. The use of a suitable phosphine ligand favoring Pd migration enabled the selective formation of the linear cross-coupling product.

40|$|Amaryllidaceae {{alkaloids}} - {{and their}} subspecies Crinum – are traditional medicinal plants that have also become {{very important for}} modern medicine. At Bayer AG in Leverkusen two novel alkaloids – Cripowelline A and B – were isolated from extracts of Crinum powellii. Both alkaloids showed a broad insecticidal effect. Within this thesis two different strategies were developed, which should allow an efficient synthesis of the aglycon of the cripowellines A and B. According to the first synthetic concept a metathesis reaction {{should be used to}} build up the polycyclic ringsystem of the aglycon. In a first attempt the sidechain – containing the amid function - of the metathesis precursor was obtained starting from commercially available piperonal with a yield of 57 % over four steps. The second sidechain should have been introduced by subsequent alpha-arylation. The arylation only led to poor yields on a test system, therefore no trials were carried out to get the target molecule. Alongside the desired metathesis precursor could be synthesized by addition of a benzyllithium species to a carbonyl compound. Although four different benzylic compounds could be synthesized in yields of 38 or 45 % over 6 or 7 steps respectively, {{it was not possible to}} obtain the desired product, because no lithiation of the benzylic position could be achieved. In another effort towards the precursor the sidechain bearing the allylic ketone could be introduced starting from commercially available 3, 4 -(methylendioxy) phenylacetic acid in 19 % yield over five steps. However, the reaction to the secondary amine by cleavage of the acetal and subsequent reductive amination was not successful. According to a second synthetic concept an alpha-arylation reaction should be used to build up the ringsystem. The synthesis of the desired arylation precursor was completed in nine steps using commercially available D-tartaric acid in an overall yield of 24 %. The keysteps of this synthetic sequence were the oxidation of a polyfunctional building block using perruthenate as well as the generation of the methylketone by alkylation of 2 -dimethylaminopropannitrile. This ketone was converted to the desired silyl enol ethers by using triethylamine and the corresponding silyltriflates. However, it was not possible to achieve alpha-arylation using the protocols of Buchwald et al., Hallberg et al. and Kuwajima et al. But it was possible to obtain the desired <b>arylation</b> <b>product</b> by using Kuwajimaïs conditions in an intermolekular highly functionalized test system. Tropional is an artificial fragrance used in many perfumes which presents a fresh, marine scent. Within this thesis the synthesis of both enantiomers of Tropional based on the SAMP/RAMP-hydrazone method developed by Enders et al. Starting from the enantiomerically pure propanale hydrazones the desired alpha-alkylated hydrazones could be obtained in yields greater than 70 % by deprotonation with LDA at - 100 øC. Subsequent cleavage to the nitrile and reduction with DIBAL-H led to both enantiomeric forms of Tropional with a yield of 57 % and 61 % respectively over 3 steps. The determination of the enantiomeric excesses was successful after reduction of Tropional with borane dimethylsulfide to the corresponding alcohols. In both cases the enantiomeric excesses were determined to be 90 % by chiral stationary phase HPLC. The olfactory evaluation showed remarkable differences in odour intensity and in the characteristic odour notes...|$|R
40|$|Since its discovery, the Heck {{reaction}} {{has received}} great attention from academic research. As a result, many advances have been made, making the Heck reaction {{one of the}} most widely adopted methods for the construction of carbon-carbon bonds in modern organic chemistry. Chapter 1 presents a brief history of the Heck reaction, from its initial discovery to current day applications. This is followed by a brief overview of the different classes of cross-coupling reactions catalysed by palladium. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of alkyl aryl ketones from aryl chlorides and aldehydes by the development of a novel Heck-type acylation reaction. The aldehyde first condenses with pyrrolidine to form an enamine intermediate, which acts as an electron-rich olefin and undergoes a regioselective Heck coupling with the aryl chloride. Additional experiments such as in-situ¬ IR spectroscopy were carried out in order to probe the reaction mechanism. Chapter 3 is an extension of Chapter 2. The scope of the newly developed acylation reaction is extended beyond commercially available aliphatic aldehydes. The palladium catalysed Heck arylation-isomerisation reaction of aryl bromides and allyl alcohol leads to the generation of aldehydes which, by intervention of pyrrolidine and the same palladium catalyst, undergo the acylation reaction with a second aryl bromide. This leads to the one-pot synthesis of functionalised dihydrochalcones from readily available starting materials. Chapter 4 presents the development of a second one-pot methodology, based on the same principle of design, whereby the reactive C=C double bond is generated in situ. A Keggin-type heteropolyacid is employed to catalyse the¬ formation of styrenes from secondary aryl alcohols which, following addition of palladium, base and an aryl bromide, undergo regioselective Heck <b>arylation.</b> Interesting stilbene <b>products</b> are obtained in good to excellent yields...|$|R
40|$|Three {{series of}} bithiophene azo dyes {{functionalized}} with thiazol- 2 -yl or benzothiazol- 2 -yl-diazene acceptor moieties were synthesized through azo coupling reaction using 2, 2 ´-bithiophene, 5 -alkoxy- 2, 2 ´-bithiophenes, 5 -N,N-dialkylamino- 2, 2 ´-bithiophenes and thiazolyl and benzothiazolyl diazonium salts as coupling components. The 5 -alkoxy- 2, 2 ´-bithiophene precursors yielded the 5 -thiazolylazo- 5 ´-alkoxy- 2, 2 ´-bithiophenes, while the azo coupling reaction of 5 -N,N-dialkylamino- 2, 2 ´-bithiophenes with the thiazolyldiazonium salt gave 4 -thiazolyl-azo- 5 -N,N-dialkylamino- 2, 2 ´-bithiophenes. A different reactivity behavior was observed for 2, 2 -bithiophene with thiazolyl diazonium salts which {{gave rise to}} the expected azo dyes together with several <b>arylation</b> <b>products.</b> The redox behavior, thermal stability, and the first hyperpolarizability of the novel chromophores were evaluated through cyclic voltammetry, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and hyper-Rayleight scattering (HRS) respectively. By varying the position of the thiazolyldiazene acceptor group on the bithiophene system, the electrochemical behavior as well as the optical (linear and nonlinear) properties of the donor-acceptor -conjugated systems can readily be tuned. Push-pull 5 -thiazolylazo- 5 ´-alkoxy- 2, 2 ´-bithiophenes exhibit the most promising redox and the solvatochromic properties and second order nonlinear optical response. The redox and the optical properties also show notable variations for the different heterocyclic spacers and were also sensitive to the electronic acceptor strength of the (benzo) thiazolyldiazene moieties.

40|$|Transition metal-catalyzed {{reactions}} are rapidly being {{developed for the}} synthesis complex natural and non-natural products. Among these, palladium-catalyzed {{reactions are}} both attractive and reliable. However, a formidable challenge {{at the forefront of}} organic chemistry is the control of selectivity to enable the selective formation of diverse structural motifs from readily available substrate classes. Herein, progress toward broadening the scope of palladium-catalyzed C–C bond-forming reactions is demonstrated, with a particular focus on controlling reactivity, regioselectivity, and chemoselectivity. ^ Chapters 1 and 2 describe detailed studies of chemoselectivity with palladium-based phosphine catalysts and readily available 2 -B(pin) -substituted allylic acetates, benzoates, and carbonates. Depending on the choice of reagents, catalysts and reaction conditions, 2 -B(pin) -substituted allylic acetates and derivatives can be steered into one of three reaction manifolds: allylic substitution, Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling, or elimination to form allenes, all with excellent chemoselectivity. Detailed study of this system indicates the relative order of reactivity toward Pd(0) is Ar–I 3 ̆e Ar–Br 3 ̆e allylic carbonate 3 ̆e allylic benzoate 3 ̆e allylic acetate, with the reactivity of allylic carbonates approaching that of aryl bromides. Additionally, we also probe the regioselectivity with 1, 2, 3 -trisubstituted allylic substrates in Tsuji-Trost allylic substitution reactions. Bulkier C– 2 substituents in 1, 2, 3 -trisubstituted η 3 -allylpalladium intermediates provide stronger preference for nucleophilic attack at anti-oriented benzylic termini. ^ Chapters 3 and 4 describe a direct C–H functionalization approach to produce skeletally diverse aryl(pyridyl) methyl core structures. The novel arylation step is catalyzed by a Pd(OAc) 2 /NIXANTPHOS-based system via a deprotonative cross-coupling process. Under conditions where the azaarylmethyl amines or ethers’ benzylic C–H is reversibly deprotonated, a Pd(OAc) 2 /NIXANTPHOS-based catalyst couples the resulting carbanions with various aryl halides to provide new C–C bonds. The efficient and operationally simple protocols enable generation of either <b>arylation</b> <b>products</b> or tandem arylation/[1, 2]-Wittig rearrangement products with remarkable selectivity and good to excellent yields. Choice of base, solvent, and reaction temperature play a pivotal role in tuning the reactivity of intermediates and controlling the relative rates of competing processes. These practical methods will be applicable for the synthesis of a broad array of pyridyl-containing amines, ethers and alcohols. ...|$|E
40|$|Homogeneous palladium-catalyzed Heck {{vinylation}} of aryl chlorides {{was investigated}} under air using Herrmann’s palladacycle and the P(t-Bu) 3 -liberating salt [(t-Bu) 3 PH]BF 4. Based on the results, controlled microwave heating was utilized to accelerate model Heck reactions with aryl chlorides down to 30 min employing an electron-poor olefin and {{a mixture of}} an ionic liquid and 1, 4 -dioxane as solvent. For the first time, a highly regioselective general protocol has been developed for palladium-catalyzed terminal (β-) arylation of acyclic vinyl ethers using inexpensive aryl chlorides as starting materials and the preligand [(t-Bu) 3 PH]BF 4 as the key additive. This swift and straightforward protocol exploits non-inert conditions and controlled microwave heating to reduce handling and processing times, and aqueous DMF or environmentally friendly PEG- 200 as the reaction medium. Somewhat higher selectivity for the linear β-product was observed in PEG- 200. DFT calculations were performed at the B 3 LYP level of theory for the regioselectivity-determining insertion step in the Heck reaction following the neutral pathway. A series of para-substituted phenylpalladium(II) complexes was investigated in the computational study. The calculations support a ligand-driven selectivity rationale, where the electronic and steric influence of the bulky P(t-Bu) 3 ligand provides improved β-selectivity. The preparative methodology was used to synthesize the β-adrenergic blocking agent Betaxolol. Highly stereoselective Pd(0) -catalyzed β-arylation and β-vinylation of a tetra-substituted cyclopentenyl ether have been accomplished using a chiral, pyrrolidine-based and substrate-bound palladium(II) -directing group under neutral reaction conditions. To {{the best of the}} author’s knowledge, this P(t-Bu) 3 -mediated method represents the first examples of the successful utilization of aryl and vinyl chlorides in asymmetric Heck reactions. The Heck <b>arylation</b> <b>products</b> formed were hydrolyzed and isolated as the corresponding quaternary 2 -aryl- 2 -methyl cyclopentanones in good to moderate two-step yields with excellent stereoselectivity (90 - 96 % ee). Inclusion of vinyl triflates under neutral reaction conditions and one aryl triflate equipped with a strongly electron-withdrawing para-cyano substituent under cationic conditions increased the preparative usefulness of the methodology. Furthermore, diastereoselective Heck arylation of both five- and six-membered cyclic vinyl ethers with aryl bromides, using the identical chiral auxiliary and suitable Pd sources, was performed. Arylated products from the tetra-substituted cyclopentenyl ether were also in this case hydrolyzed to the corresponding 2 -aryl- 2 -methyl cyclopentanones with high to excellent enantioselectivity (85 - 94 % ee). Despite low reaction rates and relatively modest yields, arylation reactions with the tri-substituted cyclohexenyl ether were found to be highly diastereoselective (94 - 98 % de). Thus, an attractive supplement to direct Pd(0) -catalyzed α-arylation protocols, particularly when the use of organic chlorides, aryl bromides, and milder reaction conditions are of great importance, have been developed...|$|E
