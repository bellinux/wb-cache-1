Eventually, Brătianu convened with Ferdinand his return to power, and the king called on Foreign Minister Take Ionescu to resign, thus causing a political crisis that profited the PNL <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> end to the Averescu cabinet.|$|E

Hanneman, who was heavily influenced by hardcore punk music, got the other members into the genre, leading Slayer into a faster and more aggressive approach. The band's drummer Dave Lombardo asserted that his hardcore influences pushed him to play faster, contributing to shape his drumming style.|$|E

5|$|The {{potential}} for {{conflict between the}} Ottomans and Venice was still present, as evidenced in 1638, when a Venetian fleet attacked and destroyed a fleet of Barbary pirates that had sought protection in the Ottoman port of Valona, bombarding {{the city in the}} process. Sultan Murad IV was enraged: he threatened to execute all Venetians in the Empire, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> embargo on Venetian trade. Eventually, and given that the Ottomans were still engaged in a war with the Persians, the situation was defused with the Republic paying the Ottomans an indemnity of 250,000 sequins.|$|E
5|$|Following her husband's {{death in}} 1461, Catherine's role receded {{to that of}} queen dowager at the court of her stepson, King Stephen Tomašević. Two years later, forces of the Ottoman Empire led by Mehmed the Conqueror invaded Bosnia <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> end to the {{independent}} kingdom. Catherine's stepson was executed, while Sigismund and Catherine, her son and daughter by Thomas, were captured and taken to Constantinople, where they converted to Islam. Queen Catherine escaped, taking refuge in Dubrovnik and eventually settling in Rome, where she received a pension from the papacy. From Rome she strove {{to be reunited with}} her children. Her efforts to negotiate and offer a ransom proved futile. She died a Franciscan tertiary in Rome, having named the papacy guardians of Bosnia and her children heirs to the throne, should they ever return to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Justinian {{entered the}} arena of ecclesiastical statecraft shortly after his uncle's {{accession}} in 518, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> end to the Acacian schism. Previous Emperors had tried to alleviate theological conflicts by declarations that deemphasized the Council of Chalcedon, which had condemned Monophysitism, which had strongholds in Egypt and Syria, and by tolerating the appointment of Monophysites to church offices. The Popes reacted by severing ties with the Patriarch of Constantinople who supported these policies. Emperors Justin I (and later Justinian himself) rescinded these policies and reestablished the union between Constantinople and Rome. After this, Justinian also felt entitled to settle disputes in papal elections, as {{he did when he}} favoured Vigilius and had his rival Silverius deported.|$|E

5|$|Leaders of El Grito de Lares {{who were}} in exile in New York City joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee, founded on December 8, 1895 to {{continue}} the quest for independence. In 1897, {{with the aid of}} Antonio Mattei Lluberas and Fidel Velez, the local leaders of the independence movement of the town of Yauco, they organized another uprising, which became known as the Intentona de Yauco. On March 26, 1897, there was a second and last major attempt to overthrow the Spanish government. The local conservative political factions, which believed that such an attempt would be a threat to their struggle for autonomy, opposed such an action. Rumors of the planned event spread to the local Spanish authorities, who acted swiftly <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to Spanish colonial rule.|$|E
5|$|Nothing came of the proposal, which The Times of London {{called one}} of the most loathsome stories of the war. Historians believe that the SS, {{including}} its commander, Heinrich Himmler, intended the negotiations as cover for peace talks with the Western Allies that would exclude the Soviet Union and perhaps even Adolf Hitler. Whatever its purpose, the proposal was thwarted by the British government. They arrested Brand in Aleppo (then under British control), where he had gone to propose Eichmann's offer to the Jewish Agency, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> end to it by leaking details to the media.|$|E

Meanwhile, Gruntilda's sisters Mingella and Blobbelda arrive in a large digging machine, the Hag 1, and destroy the boulder trapping Gruntilda with a magical spell. Unfortunately Gruntilda's time spent underground has rotted her flesh away and reduced her to a skeleton. Seeking revenge, Gruntilda destroys Banjo's house before fleeing with her sisters. Banjo, Kazooie, and Mumbo escape the house, but Bottles, who stays behind believing it is all a joke, gets caught in the blast and is killed. The three remaining friends swear to track Gruntilda down <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> end to her plans.|$|E
5|$|Written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini, Arkham Asylum {{is based}} on the long-running comic book mythos. In the game's main storyline, Batman's archenemy, the Joker, instigates an {{elaborate}} plot to seize control of Arkham Asylum and trap Batman inside with many of his incarcerated foes. With Joker threatening to detonate hidden bombs around fictional Gotham City, Batman is forced to fight his way through the asylum's inmates <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> end to the Joker's plans. Most of the game's leading characters are voiced by actors who have appeared in other media based on the DC Animated Universe; Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Arleen Sorkin reprised their roles as Batman, the Joker, and his sidekick Harley Quinn respectively. The game is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets {{that can be used in}} combat and exploration.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 7th {{millennium}} BCE, {{human populations}} {{moved into the}} Chadian basin in great numbers. By {{the end of the}} 1st millennium AD, a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965. In 1979 the rebels conquered the capital <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> end to the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hissène Habré defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss Déby. Since 2003 the Darfur crisis in Sudan has spilt over the border and destabilised the nation, with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees living in and around camps in eastern Chad. Unsustainable high birth rates and a lack of agriculture let the country persist in poverty.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} reign of Pietro II Candiano in 932, Venice saw a string of inept leaders such as Pietro III Candiano, Pietro IV Candiano, and Tribuno Memmo. The reputed arrogance and {{ambition}} of these Doges caused {{the deterioration of the}} relationship with the Holy Roman Empire in the west, the stagnancy of the relationship with the Byzantine Empire in the east, and discord at home in the Republic. However, in 991, Pietro II Orseolo became the Doge and spent his reign pushing the boundaries of the Republic further east down the western coast of the Balkan Peninsula with his conquests in Dalmatia in 1000. This strengthened the commercial bonds with the empires of the east, Sicily, Northern Africa, and the Holy Roman Empire, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> end to the infighting among the citizens of Venice. Pietro II's negotiations with Byzantine Emperor Basil II to decrease tariffs on Venetian-produced goods helped foster a new age of prosperity in the Republic as Venetian merchants could undercut the competition in the international markets of the Byzantine Empire. Similarly, Pietro II had success developing a new relationship with Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, who displayed his friendship to him by restoring previously seized lands to Venice, opening up routes of free trade between the two states, and exempting all Venetians from taxes in the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Tropical illness took {{a toll on}} the Europeans at Fernando Po, where {{hundreds}} died during Nicolls's time there. Nineteen of the 34 men in Nicolls's first contingent died soon after their arrival, and only five of the original 47 Royal Marines who accompanied him to Fernando Po in 1829 survived two years of duty on the station. Nicolls, somewhat restored to health, served a second term as Superintendent of Fernando Po during 1832–1833. Despite his differences with Owen, Nicolls was just as determined to disrupt the slave trade, and equally energetic in his attempts to convince the British government to adopt a more aggressive stance. Frustrated in territorial annexation schemes, he invited the West African rulers of Bimbia, Old Calabar, Camaroon, Malimba, and the Bonny to Fernando Po to form an anti-slavery alliance. To Nicolls' disappointment, the British government ordered him to evacuate Fernando Po on 29 August 1832, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> end to operations there. Unfinished work and efforts {{to provide for the}} welfare of liberated and displaced slave populations delayed the end of Nicolls's mandate for several months, and he did not return to England until April 1835.|$|E
