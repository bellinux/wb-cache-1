There was disquiet <b>among</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the players that their presence in Germany gave the Nazi regime a propaganda coup.|$|E
5|$|Conservation of the {{propeller}} was completed {{nearly three years}} after its recovery and it is {{on display in the}} Monitor Center at the Mariners' Museum. As of 2013, conservation of the engine, its components, the turret and the guns continues. The Dahlgren guns were removed from the turret in September 2004 and placed in their own conservation tanks. <b>Among</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the artifacts recovered from the sunken vessel was a red signal lantern, possibly the one used to send a distress signal to Rhode Island and the last thing to be seen before Monitor sank in 1862 – it was the first object recovered from the site in 1977. A gold wedding band was also recovered from the hand of the skeletal remains of one of Monitors crew members found in the turret.|$|E

5|$|During the Napoleonic era, {{there was}} a move <b>among</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the German states to reform their systems of {{measurement}} using the prototype metre and kilogram {{as the basis of}} the new units. Baden, in 1810, for example, redefined the Ruthe (rods) as being 3.0m exactly and defined the subunits of the Ruthe as 1 Ruthe = 10Fuß (feet) = 100Zoll (inches) = 1,000Linie (lines) = 10,000Punkt (points) while the Pfund was defined as being 500g, divided into 30Loth, each of 16.67g. Bavaria, in its reform of 1811, trimmed the Bavarian Pfund from 561.288g to 560g exactly, consisting of 32 Loth, each of 17.5g while the Prussian Pfund remained at 467.711g.|$|E

Hawkins, member of Johnson's second club, the Literary Club {{established}} 1764, resigned over a dispute with others of Johnson's circle. The relationship between Hawkins {{and the rest of}} Johnson's friends became so tense that many criticised Johnson for choosing Hawkins in 1784 as one of his executors for his will. However, within hours of Johnson's death, Thomas Cadell and William Strahan asked Hawkins to write a biography and an edition of Johnson's literary works.|$|E

5|$|Outsourcing is <b>among</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> {{the many}} reasons for {{increased}} competition within developing countries.

It is because of competition (including outsourcing) that Robert Feenstra and Gordon Hanson predict {{that there will be a}} rise of 15–33 percent in inequality amongst these countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{advisory}} board attempts to remain apolitical and pragmatic in {{its approach to}} selecting new members of the Order of Canada, generally operating without input from ministers of the Crown; political interference has occurred only once, when in 1978 Paul Desmarais's investiture was delayed for six months by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. However, some of the committee's selections have caused controversy. For instance, the admission in 2001 of sex educator Sue Johanson, host of the long-running Sunday Night Sex Show, as a Member stirred controversy <b>among</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Canada's Christian organizations, as Johanson had taught teenagers methods of safe sex alongside abstinence. Similarly, the acceptance of birth control advocate Elizabeth Bagshaw and gay rights campaigner Brent Hawkes also incited debate.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{first heard}} of the Báb when he was 27, and {{received}} a visitor sent by the Báb, Mullá Husayn, telling him of the Báb and his claims. Bahá'u'lláh became a Bábí and helped to spread the new movement, especially in his native province of Núr, where he became {{recognized as one of}} its most influential believers. His notability as a local gave him many openings, and his trips to teach the religion were met with success, even <b>among</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the religious class. He also helped to protect fellow believers, such as Táhirih, for which he was temporarily imprisoned in Tehran and punished with bastinado or foot whipping. Bahá'u'lláh, in the summer of 1848, also attended the conference of Badasht in the province of Khorasan, where 81 prominent Bábís met for 22 days; at that conference where there was a discussion between those Bábís who wanted to maintain Islamic law and those who believed that the Báb's message began a new dispensation, Bahá'u'lláh took the pro-change side, which eventually won out. It is at this conference that Bahá'u'lláh took on the name Bahá.|$|E

5|$|Love in Several Masques was Fielding's first play. It was advertised on 15 January 1728 in the London Evening Post {{and first}} ran on 16 February 1728 at the Theatre Royal. Performances were held on 17, 19 and 20 February, {{with the third}} night being the author's benefit. The play was never revived. The cast {{included}} four members <b>among</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most talented of the Theatre Royal actors. Although it only ran for four nights, {{this was a great}} feat because John Gay's popular The Beggar's Opera was performed during the same time and dominated the theatrical community during its run. It was first printed on 23 February 1728 by John Watts, and a Dublin edition appeared in 1728. The play was later collected by John Watts in the 1742 and 1745 Dramatick Works and by Andrew Millar in the 1755 edition of Fielding's works. It was later translated and printed in German as Lieb unter verschiedenen Larven in 1759.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{hospitals}} in Enugu are privately run. The UNTH and the National Orthopaedic Hospital are <b>among</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the government controlled {{hospitals in the}} city. The medical equipment for the UNTH was upgraded in 2009 as well as parts of the hospital which were renovated in the same year. Most hospitals in the city suffer from a poor standard of medical facilities available to them; many of the city's citizens travel abroad for medical care. However, hospitals have been aided by foreign organisations and by Enugu's community {{at home and abroad}} who have donated medicine and other medical equipment. The most developed government hospital in Enugu is the Park Lane Hospital. The governor has said that the state has bought some ambulance service vehicles in March 2010. Enugu State has established free medical care for pregnant women and for all children under 5 years of age in the state. The child healthcare programme, founded under the District Health System (DHS), was added to the states 2008 budget. Enugu State has a HIV/AIDS prevalence of 6.5%, one of the highest in the country.|$|E
5|$|Many thrips are pests of {{commercial}} crops {{due to the}} damage caused by feeding on developing flowers or vegetables, causing discoloration, deformities, and reduced marketability of the crop. Some thrips serve as vectors for plant diseases, such as tospoviruses. Over 20 plant-infecting viruses are known to be transmitted by thrips, but perversely, less than a dozen of the described species are known to vector tospoviruses. These enveloped viruses are considered <b>among</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most damaging of emerging plant pathogens around the world, with those vector species having an outsized impact on human agriculture. Virus members include the tomato spotted wilt virus and the impatiens necrotic spot viruses. The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, has spread until it now has a worldwide distribution, and is the primary vector of plant diseases caused by tospoviruses. Their small size and predisposition towards enclosed places makes them difficult to detect by phytosanitary inspection, while their eggs, laid inside plant tissue, are well-protected from pesticide sprays. When coupled with the increasing globalization of trade and the growth of greenhouse agriculture, thrips, unsurprisingly, are among the fastest growing group of invasive species in the world. Examples include F. occidentalis, Thrips simplex, and Thrips palmi.|$|E

5|$|On April1, Hudah {{continued}} intensifying while approaching eastern Madagascar, and by 0600UTC that day, the MFR upgraded {{the storm}} to very intense tropical cyclone intensity– the highest rating on the agency's cyclone classification scale. Shortly after, at 1200UTC, {{the storm was}} analyzed to have reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 225km/h (140mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 905mbar (hPa; 26.73inHg), ranking Hudah <b>among</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded in the Southwest Indian Ocean. The JTWC listed a similar intensity for the storm, with winds of 235km/h (145mph), though these winds were for 1-minute sustained winds instead of 10-minute sustained winds. This intensity was later analyzed to have been very near the theoretical maximum for tropical cyclones in the environmental conditions Hudah was in. At the time, TRMM imagery indicated that the storm featured two concentric eyewalls. Cyclone Hudah maintained peak intensity up until it made its first landfall approximately 28km (17mi) southeast of Antalaha, Madagascar at 1730UTC on April2. Hudah substantially weakened as it traversed the mountainous terrain of northern Madagascar, and was downgraded to tropical depression status {{by the time it}} entered the Mozambique Channel at 1200UTC on March3.|$|E
