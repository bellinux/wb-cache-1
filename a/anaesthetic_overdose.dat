40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, a growing {{interest}} {{has emerged in}} the use of intravenous lipid emulsions in the treatment of lipophilic drug toxicoses. Initial interest in the therapy was prompted by its successful use in rats and dogs for reversing the life-threatening cardiovascular effects of local <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>overdoses.</b> A postulated mechanism of action of intravenous lipid emulsion in lipophilic drug toxicoses is lipid partitioning, which is creation of an intravascular lipid compartment into which lipophilic drugs may be bound and sequestered away from their sites of action. Permethrin is a highly lipophilic insecticide which can cause significant morbidity and mortality in cats through its neuroexcitatory effects. Permethrin is a common ingredient in flea treatments marketed for dogs and accidental administration to cats is common. The aims of this study were to (1) determine if a lipid emulsion added to permethrin-containing feline plasma in vitro would lead to a decrease in plasma permethrin concentration thus supporting a lipid sink effect, and (2) assess the clinical response to intravenous lipid emulsion administration in cats with permethrin toxicosis. In the in vitro study, addition of a lipid emulsion to permethrin-containing feline plasma led to a significant reduction in plasma permethrin concentration within 30 minutes. In the clinical trial, {{there was a significant difference}} in the distribution of clinical stages over time between treatment groups, with cats receiving 20 % intravenous lipid emulsion having lower clinical stages earlier than cats receiving the saline control. The results of these studies support the use of intravenous lipid emulsion in the treatment of permethrin toxicosis in cats and the in vitro study supports intravascular lipid partitioning as a mechanism of action. Future research is needed to confirm lipid partitioning as a mechanism of action of intravenous lipid emulsion in vivo for lipophilic drug toxicoses, determine the metabolic fate of lipid sequestered drugs and ascertain adverse effects of intravenous lipid emulsion at the doses recommended for drug toxicoses...|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{studied the}} effects of antithrombin III (AT III) on bacterial translocation (BT) and intestinal morphology in the early period of burn injury. For this aim, 30 male albino rats were used. A sham burn group (group 1, no. 10) was exposed to 21 °C water. A burn group (group 2, no. 10) and a burn + AT III group (group 3, no. 10) were exposed to 95 °C water for 10 sec, producing full-thickness burn in 30 % of the total body surface area. In group 3 the rats received 250 U/kg AT III via the right jugular vein, 15 min before burn injury. One ml 0. 9 % NaCl was given as a placebo in group 1 and in two rats by the same route. All group 3 rats were sacrificed on day 2 post-burn using an <b>overdose</b> <b>anaesthetic.</b> Cultures of the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, blood, and caecal contents were performed. Histopathological examinations, including polymorph nuclear leukocyte (PNL) infiltration and villus morphologies, were qualitatively evaluated on the resected distal ileal segment. The incidence of BT was 1 / 10 (10 %) in group 1, 7 / 10 (70 %) in group 2, and 1 / 10 (10 %) in group 3. A significant increase in BT incidence was observed in group 2 compared with groups 1 and 3 (p = 0. 02), while {{a significant decrease in}} BT incidence was found in group 3 rats with AT III treatment. Although the PNL infiltration rate was reduced by AT III treatment, a significant decrease was not found compared with group 2 (50 % and 90 %, respectively). On the other hand, the villus degeneration rate was significantly reduced by AT III treatment compared with group 2 (30 % and 90 %, respectively). These results suggest that the incidence of BT was enhanced by the burn injury. AT III decreased the incidence of BT in the early period of burn injury. We conclude that AT III can be effectively used to protect from intestinal mucosal injury and to prevent bacterial translocation, especially in early post-burn period...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This study {{examined}} the toxicological effects and safety of polypeptide k isolated from the seeds of Momordica charantia in laboratory rats. 30 male Sprague Dawley rats (12 weeks old, bodyweight 180 - 200 g) were randomly divided into 3 groups (1000 mg/kg, 500 mg and 0 mg/kg). Rats were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for 7 days and at day 8 rats were dosed orally with polypeptide k (in 2 % DMSO/normal saline) and the controls received the dosed vehicle only. Rats were then observed for 72 hours before sacrificed. Rats were anaesthetized by pentobarbital (50 mg/kg ip) and 2 - 3. 0 mL of blood was taken by cardiac puncture and rats were scarified by <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>overdose.</b> Immediately, organs (heart, lungs, liver, kidneys) were weigh and taken for histology. Organ sections were then evaluated by a histopathologist. Serum samples were assayed for liver functions (ALT and γ-GT) and kidney functions (BUN and creatinine). All rats showed normal behavior after the dosing and no statistical changes were observed in all blood parameters and organ weight. Histological examinations revealed normal organ structures. In conclusion, dosing of rats up to 1000 mg/kg {{did not have any}} effects on the rat behavior, liver or kidney functions nor histology of the selected organs.

40|$|Gynaecologists {{often use}} local {{anaesthetics}} in their medical practice. Some concomitant diseases during the menopausal period may cause problems during the qualification of postmenopausal women for general anaesthesia in gynaecological surgery. Many authors suggest {{the application of}} local analgesia for particular kinds of gynaecological surgery procedures performed on postmenopausal women, taking into consideration health determinants. While applying local anaesthetics, the possibility of their overdose {{has to be taken}} into account. Generalised toxic symptoms which appeared after the local anaesthesia are rare, but potentially are lethal complications. Toxic symptoms after local anaesthetic administration are manifested after accidental administration of a medicine into a blood vessel, when extravascular administration of a large volume of a local anaesthetic is absorbed into a bloodstream or with the reproducible doses of local anaesthetics which are administered when metabolism does not work sufficiently and cannot eliminate these substances. Clinical overdose of local anaesthetics is manifested by disorders in two systems. Firstly, the pathological symptoms come from the central nervous system (CNS). In the second phase, the pathological symptoms will additionally appear in the cardiovascular system. The aim of the present thesis is to remind clinical manifestations of the local <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>overdose</b> and suggest the management of patients with the aforementioned symptoms, {{especially in the case of}} intravenous lipid emulsions which have the status of an antidote in life-threatening conditions caused by cardiotoxic effects of local anaesthetics...|$|E

40|$|This review {{seeks to}} address 10 {{essential}} {{questions regarding the}} clinical use of local anaesthetics. Each local anaesthetic has distinctive physicochemical properties but with the same mode of action; they block voltage-gated sodium channels in the axon. Sodium channel block is brought about by a conformational change {{and the creation of}} a positive charge in the channel pore. Different local anaesthetics can reach the local anaesthetic binding site in the axon from the cytoplasmic compartment (classic hydrophilic pathway), or directly via its lipid membrane (hydrophobic pathway), or can enter via large-pore channels (alternative hydrophilic pathway). Beyond the nervous system, local anaesthetics exert beneficial effects on pain and can affect the inflammatory response and the haemostatic system. There are problems with the efficacy of local anaesthetics in the presence of local inflammation, and with significant intravascular toxicity, which can be fatal. But when preventive measures are taken, the incidence of cardiac arrest is low. Intralipid has been proposed to treat systemic local <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>overdose</b> and has been enthusiastically adopted worldwide, even though the mechanism of action is incompletely understood. Intralipid is an aid to the management of local anaesthetic toxicity rather than an antidote and meticulous conduct of regional anaesthesia remains paramount. All local anaesthetics are toxic, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, on virtually all tissues, including nerves and muscles. The question of whether local anaesthetics protect against perioperative tumour progression cannot be answered at this moment, and results from clinical (retrospective) studies are equivocal. Future areas of interest will be the design of new subtype-specific sodium channel blockers, but as we look forward, older local anaesthetics such as 2 -chloroprocaine are being reintroduced into the clinical setting. Multimodal perineural analgesia and liposomal bupivacaine may replace catheter techniques for some indication...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a fish survey of five ponds (Lake Panorama, Paremuka Pond 1 & 2, Danica Esplanade and Longbush Pond) in the Waitakere District by single-pass boat electrofishing on 18 and 19 of July 2007. We caught 337 fish comprising four introduced and two native fish species in 2. 89 km of fished distance from all 5 ponds. Assuming {{that each of}} the two bow-mounted anodes caught fish within a 1 m radius, the width fished was 4 m, and the total area fished was 11, 537 m² or 1. 154 ha. The water temperature for the 5 different ponds ranged between 10. 8 °C and 14. 9 °C. In Lake Panorama, shortfinned eel (Anguilla australis) were the most numerous species caught (130 fish ha⁻¹), followed by perch (Perca fluviatilis) (100 fish ha⁻¹) and tench (Tinca tinca) (40 fish ha⁻¹). In Paremuka Pond 1, koi carp (Cyprinus carpio) were the most numerous species caught (120 fish ha⁻¹), followed by shortfinned eels (50 fish ha⁻¹). In Paremuka Pond 2, koi carp were again the most numerous species caught (340 fish ha⁻¹), followed by tench (250 fish ha⁻¹) and shortfinned eels (70 fish ha⁻¹). In Danica Esplanade and Longbush Pond, shortfinned eels were the most numerous species caught (140 and 550 fish ha⁻¹respectively), followed by mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). There was more macrophyte cover around the edges of Danica Esplanade compared to Longbush Pond and this decreased the catch rate as a large number of eels in Danica Esplanade were sighted but were unable to be captured. Koi carp were only caught in the Paremuka ponds. The majority of koi carp were caught on the edges of the lake in macrophytes and rushes. Koi carp biomasses were highest in Paremuka Pond 2 at 261 kg ha⁻¹ compared to 106 kg ha⁻¹ in Paremuka Pond 1. Biomass is a more accurate reflection of the potential ecological impact of koi carp than their density. Previous results suggest that 21 - 73 % of the total population is caught on the first removal, depending on water visibility. As we fished the area at each site only once, the estimates in this survey represent a minimum abundance, and true population sizes are likely to be 1. 4 - 4. 8 times greater. The density of eels in both the Paremuka ponds is also likely to be higher as a large proportion of eels were able to escape into the macrophytes before they could be captured in the nets. Mosquitofish were also observed to be living in both the Paremuka ponds. Of ecological concern for the Paremuka ponds is the dominance of the fish biomass by introduced koi carp, which have a deleterious impact on aquatic habitats. Another concern for these ponds is the presence of small koi carp (< 200 mm), which suggests that natural spawning is most likely occurring, although recent releases of carp into the ponds in another possibility. The fate of the introduced fish varied depending on what species they were. Perch and tench were released back into the ponds after captures as they are classified as sports fish. Koi carp and mosquitofish are classified as unwanted organisms and were humanely destroyed with an <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>overdose</b> (benzocaine), and retained for further analysis...|$|E
