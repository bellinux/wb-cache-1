50|$|After Aizu's defeat Henry, his Japanese {{wife and}} <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>dozens</b> disgruntled samurai {{established}} a 600-acre settlement in California. The Wakamatsu Silk and Tea Farm {{in what is}} nowadays El Dorado County was not economically viable, mainly because the samurai lacked the necessary skills (also social) to work the land. After two years Henry Schnell {{with his wife and}} daughter disappeared without further trace. Since 1969 this first Japanese settlement in the US has been marked by a commemorative plaque.

After burning and looting the temporary structures on the site, the victors occupied it until dark when they returned to their main lines. By the next day the Hessians had reoccupied the spot but were quickly driven off again by a larger American force. This time the Hessians left ten dead with, again, a single American wounded.|$|E

The first flight of the machine took place on 31 January 1943, piloted by Hauptmann Hans-Karl Stepp. The continuing problems with <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>dozens</b> of the Ju 88P-1, and slow development of the Henschel Hs 129B-3, each of them equipped with a large, PaK 40-based, autoloading Bordkanone 7,5 7.5cm (2.95in) cannon in a conformal gun pod beneath the fuselage, meant the Ju 87G was put into production.

40|$|Aberrant DNA {{methylation}} in {{the genome}} {{is associated with}} human cancers. Tumor cells can undergo an overall loss of DNA methylation in non-coding repetitive regions (including the Alu elements) {{and at the same}} time maintain hypermethylation in the CpG islands in promoter region of multiple genes. We are interested in understanding the pattern of DNA methylation in the promoters of genes that may mediate the tumor genesis in colon cells. Recent literature survey suggested that <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>dozens</b> of genes, when mutated or undergone changes in DNA methylation, can directly promote the development of colon cancers. We downloaded the promoter sequences of these possible colon cancer causing genes from the Human Genome Browser for bioinformatics analysis and investigation of the sequence features on their Alu elements, transcription factor binding sites, and CpG islands. Our results suggest that sequence conservation of the flanking transcription factor binding sites plays an important role in protecting their flanking CpG islands from hypermethylation. In addition, colon cancer genes may harbor a lower density Alu element when compared to control random genes...|$|R

40|$|Galaxies with polar rings (PRGs) are {{a unique}} class of extragalactic objects {{allowing}} {{to investigate a}} wide range of problems, linked with the formation and evolution of galaxies, and to study the properties of their dark haloes. The progress in the study of PRGs is constrained by a small number of known objects of this type. Whitmore et al.

Up to date, we can only attribute <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>dozens</b> of kinematically-confirmed galaxies to this class, mostly from this catalogue. We present a new catalogue of PRGs, supplementing the catalogue of Whitmore et al. (1990), and significantly increasing the number of known candidate PRGs.

Approximately twenty-four were built. The SWB style was essentially identical to the V8-powered Griffith, which was discontinued in early 1967 {{as a result of the}} reputation it had gained for issues with build quality and reliability. The LWB car arrived a little later and used the same long-wheelbase chassis as the Vixen S2, and the same method of bolting the body to the chassis. <b>About</b> another <b>two</b> <b>dozen</b> of these LWB Tuscan V8s were built until production ended in 1969.|$|R

However, the move {{was part of a}} transfer of all of the Prado's collections of art after the early 19th century to other nearby buildings in the city for reasons of space; the Reina Sofía, which houses the capital's national collection of 20th-century art, was the natural place to move it to.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of optical spectroscopic {{observations}} of 54 candidate evolved massive stars revealed through the detection of mid-infrared nebulae of various shapes surrounding them with the Spitzer Space Telescope and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. These observations, carried out with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) in 2010 - 2015, led {{to the discovery of}} <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>dozens</b> emission-line stars, of which 15 stars we classify as candidate luminous blue variables (cLBVs). Spectroscopic and photometric monitoring revealed significant changes in the spectra and brightness of four newly identified cLBVs, meaning that they are new members of the class of bona fide LBVs. We present an updated list of the Galactic bona fide LBVs. Currently, this list contains eighteen stars, of which more than 70 per cent are associated with circumstellar nebulae. We also discovered a very rare [WN] star - the central star of the planetary nebula Abell 48, and a WN 3 star in a close, eccentric binary system with an O 6 V star in the Large Magellanic Cloud - the first-ever extragalactic massive star identified via detection of a circular shell around it.

40|$|We re-consider the {{polarization}} {{of the star}} light that may arise during microlensing events due to the high gradient of magnification across {{the atmosphere of the}} source star, by exploring the full range of microlensing and stellar physical parameters. Since it is already known that only cool evolved giant stars give rise to the highest polarization signals, we follow the model by Simmons et al. (2002) to compute {{the polarization}} as due to the photon scattering on dust grains in the stellar wind. Motivated by the possibility to perform a polarization measurement during an ongoing microlensing event, we consider the recently reported event catalog by the OGLE collaboration covering the 2001 - 2009 campaigns (OGLE-III events), that makes available the largest and more comprehensive set of single lens microlensing events towards the Galactic bulge. The study of these events, integrated by a Monte Carlo analysis, allows us to estimate the expected polarization profiles and to predict for which source stars and at which time is most convenient to perform a polarization measurement in an ongoing event. We find that <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>dozens</b> of OGLE-III events (about 1 percent of the total) have maximum polarization degree in the range 0. 1 < P_ max < 1 percent, corresponding to source stars with apparent magnitude I < 14. 5, being very cool red giants. This signal is measurable by using the FORS 2 polarimeter at VLT telescope with about 1 hour integration time. Comment: Originally submitted to MNRAS on 01 / 07 / 2014.
