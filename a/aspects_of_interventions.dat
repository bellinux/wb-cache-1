40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to (i) explore {{promoting}} factors for sustained return to work (RTW), according to vocational rehabilitation professionals (VRP) that are amenable to change for employees who have been on sick leave > 18 months and (ii) gain insight into crucial <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions.</b> Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 23 VRP. All interviews were transcribed fully verbatim. An inductive analysis of the transcripts was performed, using a process of identifying, coding, and categorizing the primary patterns in the data. Key influenceable promoting factors for sustained RTW by long-term sick-listed employees include: employee-based vocational guidance; integral, effective communication between the sick-listed employee and all RTW stakeholders; personal factors; a supportive work environment; and a stimulating social environment. Crucial <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> include: gathering information and setting priorities; improving qualifications; influencing cognitions; monitoring the sick-listed employee through the rehabilitation process; offering tailor-made interventions at different stages within a personal time-bound action plan; and preparing the employee and the work environment for RTW. Sustained RTW for long-term sick-listed employees can be achieved by focusing on the influenceable promoting factors for RTW. The use of combined interventions in a holistic approach involving the worker and his environment is considered the best way to address the multicausality of work disability and could help maximize RTW outcome...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Smoking {{prevalence}} {{among those}} in substance misuse treatment remains {{much higher than the}} general population, despite evidence for effective cessation interventions that do not negatively impact substance misuse outcomes. This systematic review summarises qualitative data on barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation for people in substance misuse treatment, participants’ and providers’ perceptions about effects of smoking cessation on substance misuse treatment, timing of intervention delivery and <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> perceived to be effective. Methods: Systematic review of qualitative studies and thematic synthesis of published qualitative data. Results: 10939 records and 132 full texts were screened. 22 papers reporting on 21 studies were included. Key themes identified were: strong relationships between smoking and other substance misuse; environmental influences; motivation; mental health; <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> perceived to be effective/ineffective; barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation; smoking bans/restrictions; and relationships with professionals. Many service users were motivated toward smoking cessation but were not offered support. Some felt interventions should be delivered after substance misuse treatment, whilst others felt concurrent/dual interventions would be beneficial, due to strong associations between smoking and other substances. Treatment providers felt they lacked training and resources for supporting smoking cessation, and were concerned about impact on substance misuse outcomes. Conclusions: Many substance misusers who also smoke are motivated to quit but perceive a lack of support from professionals. Additional training and resources are required to enable professionals to provide the support needed. More research is required to develop enhanced packages of care for this deprived group of smokers...|$|E

40|$|Background: The stroke survivor’s {{voice has}} been {{identified}} as a key priority when evaluating rehabilitation interventions. Employer involvement in vocational rehabilitation (VR) studies has been largely absent yet their influence considered important. This study aimed to explore stroke survivors’ (SS) and employers’ views <b>of</b> the VR <b>intervention</b> received in a feasibility randomised controlled trial. Method: Semi-structured interviews with thirteen mild/moderate SS (8 men aged 45 - 79 mean 61 SD 11. 63), 10 in F/T paid employment, 3 P/T volunteers) and six employers postintervention completion, explored acceptability, usefulness and VR implementation issues. Thematic analysis by three independent researchers followed recording and verbatim transcription. Results/Findings: The most valued <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> content were emotional support, provision of stroke specific information and feedback and the planning, implementing and reviewing of a phased return to work. Liaison with the workplace was particularly valued by employers. Continuity, accessibility and knowledge <b>of</b> therapist, individualised <b>intervention</b> and liaison with other services were <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> delivery commended by SS and employers. However, for some, the timing and duration <b>of</b> the <b>intervention</b> were not appropriate to their needs and this appeared to be linked with stroke severity. Discussion: Intervention appeared to influence the timing and success of work return. Opinions were divided on whether the NHS should or could fund this type <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> and whether employers would be willing to contribute to the costs. Conclusion: Trial participants and employers found stroke specific VR useful, acceptable and influential in terms of return to work outcomes.

40|$|Abstract: In Japan, mergers of cities, towns, {{and villages}} have {{occurred}} rapidly {{as a result}} of the Special Law on the Merger of Municipalities, enacted in 2005. These mergers may impact civil servants’ psychological adjustment. We developed the Municipal Merger Stress Questionnaire (MMSQ) to measure the impact of the municipal mergers and collected responses from 570 employees who had experienced a municipal merger (Study 1). We examined the relationships among the impact of municipal merger, Stress Responses, Self-concept (self-esteem and interpersonal dependency), and Social Support (Study 2). Two factors (Increased Workload and Worthlessness) were derived from the MMSQ in Study 1. Additionally, a structural equation model showed that the impact of the loss of value of their job (Worthlessness) related to the psychological stress responses, while job discretion did not differentiate an entire stress situation in Study 2. The result implies that psychological <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> focused on worthlessness are required to maintain good mental health of public servants at workplaces...|$|E

40|$|Treatment {{implementation}} is an under-studied and under-reported <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> studies involving {{individuals with}} autism spectrum disorder (ASD). One primary {{area of concern}} {{is the lack of}} reliable and valid implementation measures, which allows a conclusive association to be drawn between the intervention and participant outcomes. This study examined the psychometric properties of two implementation measures developed for comprehensive treatment models serving preschoolers with ASD (i. e., LEAP and TEACCH). Both of the measures were completed in classrooms using LEAP or TEACCH instructional approaches as well as in classrooms in which a business-as-usual or non-model specific treatment approach was used. Across four months of one school year, a maximum of 4 observations were conducted in each of the 34 classrooms involved in the study. Results indicated that both implementation tools are reliable and valid, and that particular subscales of these measures allowed for discrimination of the three types of classrooms from each other. This step of psychometrically validating implementation measures as part of conducting efficacy studies may yield more robust associations between implementation and intervention effects. Research highlights: ► Treatment implementation is an under-studied and under-reported <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> studies involving individuals with autism spectrum disorder. ► This study examined the psychometric properties of two implementation measures developed for comprehensive treatment models serving preschoolers with ASD (i. e., LEAP and TEACCH). ► Results indicated that both implementation tools are reliable and valid, and that particular subscales of these measures allowed for discrimination of the three types of classrooms from each other...|$|R

A triangulated approach to inquiry was used with semi-structured interviews conducted with service recipients, service providers and leaders, and key community partners (N = 159). The interview focus was upon processes of implementation and operation. A grounded theory-informed analysis revealed cross cutting themes of: a holistic conceptualization of mental health problems, an intensive application of principles of leverage and creating the social, cultural, and policy "space" within which interventions could be applied and resourced. These findings aligned with key aspects of systems dynamic theory suggesting that it might be a helpful framework in future studies of mental health service implementation in MICs...|$|E

40|$|Rising {{levels of}} burnout and poor {{well-being}} in healthcare staff are an international concern for health systems. The {{need to improve}} well-being and reduce burnout has long been acknowledged, but few interventions target mental healthcare staff, and minimal improvements have been seen in services. This review aimed to examine the problem of burnout and well-being in mental healthcare staff and to present recommendations for future research and interventions. A discursive review was undertaken examining trends, causes, implications, and interventions in burnout and well-being in healthcare staff working in mental health services. Data were drawn from national surveys, reports, and peer-reviewed journal articles. These show that staff in mental healthcare report poorer well-being than staff in other healthcare sectors. Poorer well-being and higher burnout are associated with poorer quality and safety of patient care, higher absenteeism, and higher turnover rates. Interventions are effective, but effect sizes are small. The review concludes that grounding interventions in the research literature, emphasizing the positive <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> to staff, building stronger links between healthcare organizations and universities, and designing interventions targeting burnout and improved patient care together may improve the effectiveness and uptake of interventions by staff...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe presidential address {{describes}} briefly {{the history}} of the World Federation for Vascular Societies (WFVS) and its objectives. Vascular Surgery today includes interventional procedures (open surgical and endovascular) in addition to risk factor reduction and medical treatment. It is equally important to train in clinical investigative methods, non-surgical treatment, decision making as is training in technical <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions.</b> Similarly, it is vital, that the vascular specialist always recommends the treatment which is best to the individual patient, not only what he can do or what is best for other reasons, i. e. financial. Due to the increasing complex procedures - endovascular evolution and what is then “left” for open surgery - specialisation into “mainly open vascular surgeon” and “mainly endovascular surgeon” preceded by a common basic training into both, seems unavoidable. Similar, {{in order to be able}} to train with relevant case mix and numbers, and in order always to have both complex open and endovascular skills on call 24 hours per day, 365 days a year, centralisation into larger units is necessary. The WFVS is important simply looking at the huge demographic differences throughout the world.

40|$|As {{part of the}} IDEFICS obesity {{intervention}} study, baseline {{opinions about}} key issues were elicited from the parents of children about {{to take part in}} the intervention in eight European countries. This was done by a questionnaire, in which a set of questions was specifically designed to investigate attitudes towards ethical and public-policy <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> on healthy lifestyle and diet. The aim of these questions was partly to elicit parents’ views concerning the ethics and effectiveness of interventions, responsibilities of schools and parents themselves, and also to gain some indication as to how parents might view some of the policy options available. Here we present analysis of three of the questions on public-policy regarding healthy eating: 1. “I feel that the authorities don’t do enough to support healthy eating. ” 2. “There should be a controlled restriction on advertising of high-fat and high-sugar foods. ” 3. “Very unhealthy foods should be highly taxed while healthy foods should be subsidised. ” We report here that there are statistically significant differences between the respondents both by country, and by gender. There is strong support among parents for controlled restriction on advertising of high-fat and high-sugar foods, as well as supporting of taxation of ‘unhealthy’ foods and subsidising of ‘healthy’ foods. In most countries men are more critical of authorities’ support of healthy eating than women, and they are also more in favour of taxation and subsidising of certain types of food...|$|E

40|$|Background: Epidemiological {{predictions}} {{suggest that}} dementia {{will continue to}} rise and that this will have social and economic ramifications. Effective interventions, beyond pharmacological management are needed. Psychosocial interventions have largely been investigated in relation to carers of people with dementia, or with regards {{to their ability to}} manage dementia symptoms, improve cognition, and reduce challenging behaviour. However, since dementia is a life-limiting illness and people with dementia are at risk of having their personhood compromised, psychosocial interventions should seek to enhance personhood, and offer the potential for the person to leave a legacy. Methods: An integrative review was carried out to identify, assess, appraise and synthesise studies featuring interventions, which relate to both personhood and legacy. Search strategies were developed in key databases: MEDLINE; PsycINFO; Embase; Joanna Briggs Institute; CINAHL; Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; ASSIA. Grey literature was also identified through free-text searches. Results: Thirty six articles were included in the final review, these were tabulated and were assessed based on how the intervention related to personhood and legacy. Classification resulted in three themes being identified: Offering aspects of legacy; Acknowledging the person behind the patient; Facilitating meaningful engagement. Generally, personhood <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> were well reported, but further research is required to explore legacy potential of psychosocial interventions for people with dementia. Conclusion: The integrative review provides an overview and exploration of an under-researched area, and provides directions for future research, which will help expand the evidence base and ultimately help improve patient care for people with dementia and their families...|$|E
40|$|Although {{a number}} of reviews of gender {{differences}} in conduct problems and delinquency exist, this paper fills a gap in reviewing neighborhood influences on gender differences in conduct problems and delinquency. These influences {{are known to be}} important for boys in childhood and adolescence, but cannot be assumed to be influential in the same manner for girls. The paper starts with several conceptualizations of the association between gender, neighborhoods and juvenile delinquency. It then addresses 4 key questions. Is residing in a disadvantaged neighborhood associated with problem behavior in girls? Are neighborhood effects independent of girls ’ age? Are girls in disadvantaged neighborhoods exposed to more risk factors than girls in advantaged neighborhoods?Canmediating risk factors explain gender differences in neighborhood effects on children’s and adolescents ’ conduct problems and delinquent behavior?Answers to these questions are important to steer research and elucidate <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> that can be optimized for girls. KEY WORDS: gender differences; neighborhood effects; contextual factors; juvenile delinquency. There is a general consensus that juvenile delin-quency is concentrated in disadvantaged neighbor-hoods (Ingoldsby&Shaw, 2002; Leventhal&Brooks-Gunn, 2000; Sampson & Groves, 1989; Winslow, 2001). In studies of predominantly male adolescent samples, neighborhood adversity has been linked to both minor and serious forms of delinquency, to the presence of gangs, and to a broad range of criminal ac-tivities. Research however, has largely ignored the in-fluence of neighborhood factors on the development of delinquent behavior in girls despite the fact that issues relating to etiology or opportunities for inter-vention within neighborhoods apply equally often for both girls and boys. Although a contextual model that explains and predicts female delinquent behavior has yet to b...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} interventions {{aimed at}} helping parents manage their child’s pain at home and to establish which <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> were effective. Design: Integrative narrative review. Data sources: MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, PsychINFO, PsychArticles, AMED, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Knowledge were searched in 2016. Review methods: This narrative synthesis followed Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (2008), and Economic and Social Research Council guidance (Popay et al., 2006). Reasons attributed to intervention success were analyzed using content analysis. Results: From 2, 534 papers, 17 were included. A majority were randomized controlled trials (n= 13) and most addressed postoperative pain (n= 15). A range of interventions were found which targeted parents directly, child-parent interactions and healthcare professional-parent interactions as well as complex interventions. Three studies were successful in reducing child pain at home and seven in increasing appropriate analgesic drug administration. Analysis of reasons attributed to interventions success revealed characteristics of interventions, components of parental pain management, and key features of research which aid researchers in designing and evaluating interventions. Risk of bias was present due to inadequate randomization, lack of a control group and underpowered studies. Conclusion: Nurses {{should be aware that}} targeting parents directly is the most effective way of reducing child pain at home. Nurses need to advocate for effective analgesics for their child patients as the ineffectiveness of many interventions was attributed to inadequate analgesic drugs. Once this is achieved success in increasing analgesic drug administration is most likely reached via parent-targeted interventions and those targeting healthcare professional-parent interactions. Successful interventions will be tailored to the child, and adequately powered. Including a measure of sedation will ensure sedation is not mistaken for analgesic effectiveness. Interventions should address multiple facets of pain management and include a measure of pain over a period as opposed to a snapshot in time...|$|E
