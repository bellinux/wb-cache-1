40|$|Abstract — In radio {{astronomy}} images {{are made of}} astronomical objects as they appear at radio frequencies using a technique called aperture synthesis. Signals from several antennas are correlated and integrated over time. The data collected over several hours are further processed to calibrate the instrument and to form an image or intensity map. The calibration and imaging algorithms do not use the <b>autocorrelations</b> because the receiver noise is unstable and hence considered unknown. In literature the Cramer Rao Bound for the calibration problem has been derived assuming that the <b>autocorrelations</b> {{are part of the}} available data. If the assumption is correct that the <b>autocorrelations</b> do not contain useful information when the receiver noise is unknown, than the CRB for the case that the <b>autocorrelations</b> {{are not part of the}} data will be the same. In this paper we will derive the CRB excluding the <b>autocorrelations</b> and show that it indeed does not matter whether the <b>autocorrelations</b> are included or not. I...|$|R

The main idea is to first specify distributions for the partial <b>autocorrelations</b> that are algebraically independent and take values in (− 1, 1), and then map to the Toeplitz matrix. Similarly, starting with pseudo-partial <b>autocorrelations,</b> methods {{are proposed}} for generating (q+ 1) ×(q+ 1) Toeplitz correlation matrices {{that are consistent with}} an invertible MA(q) Gaussian time series model. The density can be uniform or non-uniform over the space of <b>autocorrelations</b> up to lag p or q, or over the space of autoregressive or moving average coefficients, by making appropriate choices for the densities of the (pseudo) -partial <b>autocorrelations.</b> Important intermediate steps are the derivations of the Jacobians of the mappings between the (pseudo) -partial <b>autocorrelations,</b> <b>autocorrelations</b> and autoregressive/moving average coefficients.

25|$|As real {{measurement}} signals {{contain a}} certain level of noise, the derived 2D spectra are influenced and degraded with substantial higher amounts of noise. Hence, interpretation begins with studying the <b>autocorrelation</b> spectrum on the main diagonal of the 2D synchronous spectrum. In the 2D synchronous main diagonal signal on the right 4 peaks are visible at 10, 20, 30, and 40 (see also the 4 corresponding positive autopeaks in the 2D synchronous spectrum on the right). This indicates that in the original dataset 4 peaks of changing intensity are present. The intensity of peaks on the <b>autocorrelation</b> spectrum are directly proportional to the relative importance of the intensity change in the original spectra. Hence, if an intense band is present at position x, it is very likely that a true intensity change is occurring and the peak is not due to noise.|$|E

30|$|Generally, {{there are}} two forms of spatial autocorrelation: <b>autocorrelations</b> of {{environmental}} gradients and species' distributions. Herein, <b>autocorrelations</b> of species' distributions were specifically measured {{as the number of}} species found in each grid cell as used in previous studies (Tognelli and Kelt 2004; Vieira et al. 2008), or aggregated occupancy information of each single species. Spatial <b>autocorrelations</b> of species richness are derived from spatial <b>autocorrelations</b> of environmental variables and/or dispersal limitations of each single species. Because all examined vertebrate groups are constrained to the global terrestrial scale, it is assumed that the influence of spatial <b>autocorrelations</b> of environmental variables is basically equivalent over various vertebrate groups (because the distributions of all species are bound to the Earth's surface). As a consequence, it is supposed that resultant species richness patterns are principally driven by differences in dispersal abilities among taxonomic groups. Of course, this strong assumption cannot eliminate the fact that important environmental predictors can vary across different species, but the central goal {{of the present study was}} to reveal the effect of dispersal on species richness patterns.|$|R

25|$|The {{structural}} {{relaxation of}} a viscoelastic gel {{has been identified}} as primary mechanism responsible for densification and associated pore evolution in both colloidal and polymeric silica gels. Experiments in the viscoelastic properties of such skeletal networks on various time scales require a force varying with a period (or frequency) appropriate to the relaxation time of the phenomenon investigated, and inversely proportional to the distance over which such relaxation occurs. High frequencies associated with ultrasonic waves have been used extensively in the handling of polymer solutions, liquids and gels and the determination of their viscoelastic properties. Static measurements of the shear modulus have been made, as well as dynamic measurements of the speed of propagation of shear waves, which yields the dynamic modulus of rigidity. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques have been utilized in order to monitor the dynamics of density fluctuations through the behavior of the <b>autocorrelation</b> function near the point of gelation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Traditional {{tests for}} {{conditional}} heteroscedasticity {{are based on}} testing for signicant <b>autocorrelations</b> of squared or absolute observations. In the context of high frequency time series of nancial returns, these <b>autocorrelations</b> are often positive and very persistent, although their magnitude is usually very small. More-over, the sample <b>autocorrelations</b> are severely biased towards zero, especially if the volatility is highly persistent. Consequently, {{the power of the}} traditional tests is often very low. In this paper, we propose a new test that takes into account not only the magnitude of the sample <b>autocorrelations</b> but also possible patterns among them. This additional information makes the test more powerful in situations of empirical interest. The asymptotic distribution of the new statistic is derived and its nite sample properties are analyzed by means of Monte Carlo experiments. The performance of the new test is compared with various alternative tests. Finally, we illustrate the results analyzing several time series of nancial returns.

40|$|Empirical {{research}} on market inefficiencies {{focuses on the}} detection of <b>autocorrelations</b> in price time series. In the case of crude oil markets, statistical support is claimed for weak efficiency {{over a wide range}} of time-scales. However, the results are still controversial since theoretical arguments point to deviations from efficiency as prices tend to revert towards an equilibrium path. This paper studies the efficiency of crude oil markets by using lagged detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to detect delay effects in price <b>autocorrelations</b> quantified in terms of a multiscaling Hurst exponent (i. e., <b>autocorrelations</b> are dependent of the time scale). Results based on spot price data for the period 1986 - 2009 indicate important deviations from efficiency associated to lagged <b>autocorrelations,</b> so imposing the random walk for crude oil prices has pronounced costs for forecasting. Evidences in favor of price reversion to a continuously evolving mean underscores the importance of adequately incorporating delay effects and multiscaling behavior in the modeling of crude oil price dynamics.
