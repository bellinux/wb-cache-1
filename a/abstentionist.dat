5|$|Feminists in Ireland in {{the early}} 20th century {{included}} the revolutionary Irish Republican, suffragette and socialist Constance Markievicz who in 1918 {{was the first woman}} elected to the British House of Commons. However, in line with Sinn Féin <b>abstentionist</b> policy, she would not take her seat in the House of Commons. She was re-elected to the Second Dáil in the elections of 1921. She was also a commander of the Irish Citizens Army which was led by the socialist & self-described feminist, Irish leader James Connolly during the 1916 Easter Rising.|$|E
25|$|From 1983 to 1992 {{and from}} 1997 to 2011, {{he was an}} <b>abstentionist</b> Member of Parliament (MP) of the British Parliament for the Belfast West constituency.|$|E
25|$|Sinn Féin are <b>abstentionist</b> and {{therefore}} {{do not take}} their seats or vote in the House of Commons. A Northern Ireland Assembly motion proposed by Sinn Féin and the Green Party of Northern Ireland to call for same-sex marriage was defeated by the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abstentionists</b> {{believe that}} {{although}} alcohol consumption is not inherently sinful or necessarily {{to be avoided}} in all circumstances, it is generally not the wisest or most prudent choice. While most <b>abstentionists</b> do not require abstinence from alcohol for membership in their churches, they do often require it for leadership positions.|$|R
50|$|During {{the next}} few years, the party was divided between <b>abstentionists</b> and anti-abstentionists. The <b>abstentionists</b> would {{immediately}} resign their post in the Council of Government immediately upon election as a protest against the token representation of the electorate on the Council; the anti-abstentionists favoured co-operation with the colonial authorities {{in order to work}} for a better constitution.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Abstentionists</b> also {{reject the}} {{position}} of moderationists that in many circumstances Christians should feel free to drink for pleasure because <b>abstentionists</b> see alcohol as inherently too dangerous and not [...] "a necessity for life or good living," [...] with some even {{going so far as}} to say, [...] "Moderation is the cause of the liquor problem." ...|$|R
25|$|The Liberal Democrats {{expenses}} {{were revealed}} {{last of the}} three main parties, followed by Sinn Féin members' claims {{in which it was}} reported that the five Sinn Féin MPs together had claimed nearly £500,000 in second home allowances, despite never taking up their seats at Westminster due to the party's <b>abstentionist</b> policy. Sinn Féin stated that its members often have to travel to London on parliamentary business.|$|E
25|$|Nine other IRA and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) {{members who}} were {{involved}} in the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike died after Sands. On the day of Sands's funeral, Unionist leader Ian Paisley held a memorial service outside of Belfast city hall to commemorate the victims of the IRA. In the Irish general elections held the same year, two anti H-block candidates won seats on an <b>abstentionist</b> basis.|$|E
25|$|The party overtook its {{nationalist}} rival, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, as {{the largest}} nationalist party in the local elections and UK general election of 2001, winning four Westminster seats to the SDLP's three. The party continues to subscribe, however, to an <b>abstentionist</b> policy towards the Westminster British parliament, on account of opposing that parliament's jurisdiction in Northern Ireland, {{as well as its}} oath to the Queen.|$|E
5000|$|Current {{views on}} alcohol in Christianity {{can be divided}} into moderationism, abstentionism, and prohibitionism. <b>Abstentionists</b> and prohibitionists are {{sometimes}} lumped together as [...] "teetotalers" [...] (compare list of teetotalers), sharing some similar arguments. However, prohibitionists abstain from alcohol {{as a matter of law}} (that is, they believe God requires abstinence in all ordinary circumstances), while <b>abstentionists</b> abstain as a matter of prudence (that is, they believe total abstinence is the wisest and most loving way to live in the present circumstances).|$|R
50|$|Additionally, <b>abstentionists</b> {{argue that}} while {{drinking}} {{may have been}} more acceptable in ancient times (for instance, using wine to purify polluted drinking water), modern circumstances have changed the nature of a Christian's responsibility in this area. First, some <b>abstentionists</b> argue that wine in biblical times was weaker and diluted with water such that drunkenness was less common, though few non-abstentionists accept this claim as wholly accurate or conclusive. Also, the invention of more efficient distillation techniques has led to more potent and cheaper alcohol, which in turn has lessened the economic barrier to drinking to excess compared to biblical times.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the success}} of Kelly and McGleenan at the election, most of the <b>abstentionists</b> left the League. The {{executive}} was reorganised, McAteer becoming Chairman, McSparran President, and Paddy McGill was appointed as the new Secretary.|$|R
25|$|In June 1927 {{a general}} {{election}} was held in which de Valera's new party, Fianna Fáil, won many seats on an <b>abstentionist</b> platform. In July the Minister for Justice, Kevin O'Higgins, was assassinated {{on his way home}} from Sunday Mass by the IRA. Cosgrave had legislation passed to force Fianna Fáil to take their seats in the Dáil and this proved successful with de Valera and his party entering the Dáil. Previously, without de Valera, Cosgrave faced very little opposition, giving him considerable freedom of action. However, de Valera's arrival significantly altered the situation.|$|E
25|$|Sinn Féin: Sinn Féin won {{the most}} votes in Northern Ireland in 2010, but came second in seats, winning five constituencies. It {{was second in}} the 2011 Assembly elections, but first in the 2014 European elections. Sinn Féin follows an <b>abstentionist</b> policy {{with respect to the}} Commons, and has never so far taken its seats there. The party also {{operates}} in the Republic of Ireland, where it does take seats in parliament. It was standing in all 18 Northern Irish constituencies. Michelle Gildernew lost her seat in 2015, which she had held by only 4 votes in 2010, thus reducing the SF MPs from 5 to 4.|$|E
25|$|The Dáil {{nominations}} were {{decided on}} 8 July. 57 candidates contested; 101 TDs voted, with one ballot deemed ineligible. 52 TDs did not vote, including all 44 <b>abstentionist</b> Sinn Féin TDs, who were ineligible to vote {{as they had}} not taken the Oath of Allegiance. TDs supported candidates on party lines. Of the 38 successful nominees, O'Sullivan classifies 21 as supporters of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, 9 as Independent, 5 as in the Farmers' Party, and 3 as in the Labour Party. Four of the ten candidates rejected by the Seanad were also among the Dáil candidates, with John J. Horgan securing a nomination at the second attempt.|$|E
5000|$|Christians {{should make}} a public {{statement}} against drunkenness because of the negative consequences it can have on individuals, families, and society as a whole. Some <b>abstentionists</b> believe that their witness as persons of moral character is also enhanced by this choice.|$|R
50|$|In {{the wake}} of the hunger strikes, Sinn Féin, which had become the Provisional IRA's {{political}} wing, began to contest elections {{for the first time in}} both Northern Ireland (as <b>abstentionists)</b> and in the Republic. In 1986, Sinn Féin recognised the legitimacy of the Irish Dáil, which caused a small group of members to break away and form Republican Sinn Féin.|$|R
5000|$|The Bible {{warns that}} alcohol can hinder moral discretion. As {{discussed}} above, Proverbs 31:4-5 warns kings and rulers {{that they might}} [...] "forget what is decreed, and pervert the rights of all the afflicted." [...] Some <b>abstentionists</b> speak of alcohol as [...] "corrupting" [...] the body and as a substance that can [...] "impair my judgment and further distract me from God's will for my life." ...|$|R
25|$|The Constitution of Ireland {{replaced}} the Constitution of the Irish Free State {{which had been}} in effect since the independence, as a dominion, of the Irish state from the United Kingdom on 6 December 1922. There were two main motivations for replacing the constitution in 1937. Firstly, the Statute of Westminster 1931 granted parliamentary autonomy to the six British Dominions (now known as Commonwealth realms) within a British Commonwealth of Nations. This {{had the effect of}} making the dominions sovereign nations in their own right. The Irish Free State constitution of 1922 was, in the eyes of many, associated with the controversial Anglo-Irish Treaty. The anti-treaty faction, who opposed the treaty initially by force of arms, was so opposed to the institutions of the new Irish Free State that it initially took an <b>abstentionist</b> line toward them, boycotting them altogether. However, the largest element of this faction became convinced that abstentionism could not be maintained forever. This element, led by Éamon de Valera, formed the Fianna Fáil party in 1926, which entered into government following the 1932 general election.|$|E
25|$|While Haughey had {{identified}} {{the problem with}} the economy, his actions made the problem worse. He increased public spending, which soon became out of control, and led to increases in borrowing and taxation at an unacceptable level. By 1981 Haughey was still reasonably popular and decided to call a general election. However, the timing of the election was thwarted twice by external events, in particular the hunger strikes of IRA volunteers for political status. The Anti H-Block Committee announced that they would field <b>abstentionist</b> candidates which many predicted correctly would take Republican votes away from Fianna Fáil. This coincinded with the Stardust Disaster, where a fire destroyed a night club in Haughey's constituency and claimed the lives of 48 young people; these caused Haughey to delay the Ard Fheis and the election. The poll was eventually held in June, much later than Haughey wanted. In the hope of winning an overall Dáil majority Haughey's campaign took a populist line with regard to taxation, spending and Northern Ireland. The campaign was enhanced and hyped up by a live debate on RTÉ between Haughey and the Fine Gael leader Garret FitzGerald over the major issues. On the day of the vote Fianna Fáil won 45.5%, failing to secure a majority in the 166-seat Dáil. A Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition came to power under FitzGerald and Haughey went into opposition.|$|E
25|$|Even {{after the}} {{election}} of Bobby Sands as MP for Fermanagh/South Tyrone, {{a part of the}} mass mobilisation associated with the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike by republican prisoners in the H blocks of the Maze Prison (known as Long Kesh by republicans), Adams was cautious that the level of political involvement by Sinn Féin could lead to electoral embarrassment. Charles Haughey, the Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland, called an election for June 1981. At an Ard Chomhairle meeting, Adams recommended that they contest only four constituencies which were in border counties. Instead, H-Block/Armagh candidates contested nine constituencies and elected two TDs. This, along with the election of Sands, was a precursor to an electoral breakthrough in elections in 1982 to the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly. Adams, Danny Morrison, Martin McGuinness, Jim McAllister, and Owen Carron were elected as abstentionists. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) had announced before the election that it would not take any seats and so its 14 elected representatives also abstained from participating in the Assembly and it was a failure. The 1982 election was followed by the 1983 Westminster election, in which Sinn Féin's vote increased and Gerry Adams was elected, as an <b>abstentionist,</b> as MP for Belfast West. It was in 1983 that Ruairí Ó Brádaigh resigned as President of Sinn Féin and was succeeded by Gerry Adams.|$|E
50|$|She was re-elected at the June 1927 general election. In {{accordance}} with Sinn Féin {{policy of the}} time she did not take her seat in Dáil Éireann. She stayed with the <b>abstentionists</b> of Sinn Féin when Éamon de Valera left to found Fianna Fáil. Sinn Féin was unable to raise the funds to contest the second election called that year, and Brugha did not contest the September 1927 general election.|$|R
50|$|Batista held an {{election}} in 1954, running as the candidate of a political coalition that included the Progressive Action Party, the Radical Union Party and the Liberal Party. The opposition divided into <b>abstentionists</b> and electoralists. The <b>abstentionists</b> favored boycotting the elections regardless of {{the circumstances in which}} they were held, whereas the electoralists sought certain rights and guarantees to participate. The CIA had predicted that Batista would use any means necessary to ensure he won the election. Batista lived up to their expectations, utilizing fraud and intimidation to secure his presidency. This led most of the other parties to boycott the elections. Former President Ramón Grau San Martín, leading the electoralist factions of the Cuban Revolutionary Party, participated through the political campaign but withdrew from the campaign days before election day, charging that his supporters had been terrorized. Thus Batista was elected president with the support of 45.6% of registered voters. Despite the boycott, Grau received the support of 6.8% of those who voted. The remaining voters abstained.|$|R
50|$|Abstentionism is {{standing}} for election to a deliberative assembly while refusing {{to take up}} any seats won or otherwise participate in the assembly's business. Abstentionism differs from an election boycott in that <b>abstentionists</b> participate in the election itself. Abstentionism {{has been used by}} Irish republican political movements in the United Kingdom and Ireland since the early 19th century. It was also used by Hungarian and Czech nationalists in the Austrian Imperial Council in the 1860s.|$|R
2500|$|Republican Sinn Féin {{uphold the}} <b>abstentionist</b> {{tradition}} to both [...] "partitionist parliaments" [...] plus Westminster, and {{view themselves as}} the Sinn Féin organisation founded in 1905.|$|E
2500|$|Following the October Revolution, Bordiga {{rallied to}} the Communist {{movement}} and formed the Communist <b>Abstentionist</b> faction within the Socialist Party. <b>Abstentionist</b> {{in that it}} opposed participation in [...] "bourgeois elections", the group would form, {{with the addition of}} the former L'Ordine Nuovo grouping in Turin around Antonio Gramsci, the backbone of the Communist Party of Italy (PCd'I, Partito Comunista d'Italia) founded at Livorno in January 1921. This came after a long internal struggle in the PSI: it had voted as early as 1919 to affiliate to the Comintern, but had refused to purge its reformist wing. In the course of the conflict, Bordiga attended the 2nd Comintern Congress in 1920, where he added 2 points to the 19 conditions of membership proposed by Vladimir Lenin. Nevertheless, he was criticised by Lenin in his work [...]|$|E
2500|$|Other {{policies}} of the RSF include {{the separation of church}} and state and the importance of the Irish language [...] "to the Irish identity". It is also <b>abstentionist</b> as both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were created by acts of the British Parliament against what it called the [...] "wishes of the Irish people".|$|E
50|$|Alcoholic {{beverages}} {{appear in}} the Bible, both in usage and in poetic expression. The Bible is ambivalent towards alcohol, considering it both a blessing from God that brings merriment and a potential danger that can be unwisely and sinfully abused. Christian views on alcohol come from what the Bible says about it, along with Jewish and Christian traditions. The biblical languages have several words for alcoholic beverages, and though prohibitionists and some <b>abstentionists</b> dissent, there is a broad consensus that the words did ordinarily refer to intoxicating drinks.|$|R
40|$|A new {{viewpoint}} on electoral {{involvement is}} proposed {{from the study}} of the statistics of the proportions of <b>abstentionists,</b> blank and null, and votes according to list of choices, in a large number of national elections in different countries. Considering 11 countries without compulsory voting (Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Spain and Switzerland), a stylized fact emerges for the most populated cities when one computes the entropy associated to the three ratios, which we call the entropy of civic involvement of the electorate. The distribution of this entropy (over all elections and countries) appears to be sharply peaked near a common value. This almost common value is typically shared since the 1970 's by electorates of the most populated municipalities, and this despite the wide disparities between voting systems and types of elections. Performing different statistical analyses, we notably show that this stylized fact reveals particular correlations between the blank/null votes and <b>abstentionists</b> ratios. We suggest that the existence of this hidden regularity, which we propose to coin as a `weak law on recent electoral behavior among urban voters', reveals an emerging collective behavioral norm characteristic of urban citizen voting behavior in modern democracies. Analyzing exceptions to the rule provide insights into the conditions under which this normative behavior can be expected to occur.

50|$|Stephen Thomas was in {{some ways}} a charismatic figure, he was renowned for his {{pastoral}} and preaching gifts, but he could also divide opinion. He vigorously exposed an important case of misuse of funds in the Church in Wales, incurring thereby some ill-will, and his sociable manner, coupled with {{his opposition to the}} Sunday Closing legislation which closed Welsh public houses {{on the first day of}} the week irritated Nonconformist <b>abstentionists.</b> A prominent representative of the Anglo-Catholic school of theology, he seems however to have avoided the narrowness of outlook of some more conservative Christians and played an important role in Jewish-Christian dialogue in the Cardiff area.|$|R
2500|$|Sinn Féin, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Éamon de Valera, called for a boycott of the election. [...] Sinn Féin had not boycotted the 1923 Dáil election, but rather contested it on an <b>abstentionist</b> platform.

2500|$|Articles 2 and 3 of the Republic's constitution, which claimed {{sovereignty}} {{over all of}} Ireland, were reworded, and a power-sharing Executive Committee was provided for. As part of their deal, Sinn Féin agreed to abandon its <b>abstentionist</b> policy regarding a [...] "six-county parliament", as a result taking seats in the new Stormont-based Assembly and running the education and health and social services ministries in the power-sharing government.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} after the split, the Provisionals moved towards a {{complete}} cessation of armed struggle, while Sinn Féin entered constitutional politics.

However, Sinn Féin maintains an <b>abstentionist</b> stance towards the Westminster Parliament.|$|E
2500|$|Paul advises Timothy that {{he should}} not drink water only, but should use a little wine {{for the sake of his}} stomach and {{frequent}} infirmities. Some have suggested this advice is particularly in reference to purifying low quality drinking water, while others suggest it was simply intended to help his digestion and general sickliness. <b>Abstentionists</b> generally regard this passage as a positive example of abstention from wine and see Paul's instructions as exceptional and purely for the sake of health, while other interpreters suggest that Timothy was [...] "upright in his aims" [...] but here guilty of an [...] "excess of severity" [...] or that he felt inappropriately bound by a Hellenistic custom that younger men should not drink.|$|R
5000|$|He {{became a}} member of the Colorado Party in his early twenties. The party, then in the opposition, split in 1927, facing a {{proposal}} of the Liberal government, headed by president Eligio Ayala. Ayala wanted the Colorados to participate in the drafting of a new electoral law. It was his intention to make sure that both parties should participate in the upcoming election for the congress. This caused a split in the Colorado Party amongst the [...] "eleccionistas" [...] (electionists), who accepted the offer, and the [...] "abstencionistas" [...] (<b>abstentionists),</b> who wanted a stronger and radical opposition against the government. Molas joined to the last group and became a close aide to their leader, former president Pedro P. Peña.|$|R
