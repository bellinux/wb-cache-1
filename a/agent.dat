Classes of chemical weapons include nerve <b>agents,</b> vesicants (blister <b>agents),</b> choking <b>agents,</b> incapacitating <b>agents,</b> riot control <b>agents,</b> blood <b>agents,</b> and toxic industrial chemicals. The nerve <b>agents</b> work by blocking the actions of acetylcholinesterase leading to a cholinergic syndrome. Nerve <b>agents</b> include sarin, tabun, VX, cyclosarin, and soman. The vesicants include sulfur mustard and lewisite. The vesicants produce blisters and also damage the upper airways. Choking <b>agents</b> include phosgene and chlorine gas. Choking <b>agents</b> cause pulmonary edema. Incapacitating <b>agents</b> include fentanyl and its derivatives and adamsite. Riot control <b>agents</b> include Mace and pepper spray.

5|$|An agency {{relationship}} is between three parties - a principal, who authorises an <b>agent</b> {{to make a}} contract on his behalf with a third party. In agency situations an <b>agent</b> can make a contract with a third party that is binding on the principal, even though he was not privy to the original contract. The right of an <b>agent</b> to make this sort of agreement is found in statute, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which allows a dealer for a financial company to set up credit agreements as a representative of that company.|$|E

5|$|Discovering that Talbot {{has already}} confiscated the painting, Coulson agrees {{to meet with}} him after {{debriefing}} his team.

May is attacked by <b>Agent</b> 33, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. <b>agent</b> brainwashed into Hydra's service, who knocks May unconscious and uses the same device to take on her voice and appearance. <b>Agent</b> 33 goes to the Bus, a S.H.I.E.L.D. plane being used as a mobile command center, where she secretly plants a computer virus before meeting with Coulson. Further discussing his contingency plan, in which May would kill Coulson and replace him as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Coulson deduces that <b>Agent</b> 33 is not May and turns on her; this draws the attention of Bakshi, who was ready to torture May to gain S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for providing automated trading <b>agents</b> to a population, focusing on bilateral negotiation with unenforceable agreements. A new type of <b>agents,</b> called semicooperative (SC) <b>agents</b> is proposed for this environment. When these <b>agents</b> negotiate with each other they reach a pareto-optimal solution that is mutually beneficial. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate the superiority of providing such <b>agents</b> for humans over supplying equilibrium <b>agents</b> or letting people design their own <b>agents.</b> These results are based on our observation {{that most people do}} not modify SC <b>agents</b> even though they are not in equilibrium. Our findings introduce a new factor —human response to provided <b>agents</b> — that should be taken into consideration when developing <b>agents</b> that are provided to a population. ...|$|R
