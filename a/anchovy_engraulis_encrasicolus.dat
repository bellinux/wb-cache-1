50|$|Recruitment of fish is {{regulated}} by larval fish survival. Survival {{is regulated}} by prey abundance, predation, and hydrology. Fish eggs and larvae are eaten by many marine organisms. For example, {{they may be}} fed upon by marine invertebrates, such as copepods, arrow worms, jellyfish, amphipods, marine snails and krill. Because they are so abundant, marine invertebrates inflict high overall mortality rates. Adult fish also prey on fish eggs and larvae. For example, haddock were observed satiating themselves with herring eggs back in 1922. Another study found cod in a herring spawning area with 20,000 herring eggs in their stomachs, and concluded that they could prey on half of the total egg production. Fish also cannibalise their own eggs. For example, separate studies found northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) were responsible for 28% of the mortality in their own egg population, while Peruvian anchoveta were responsible for 10% and South African <b>anchovy</b> (<b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus)</b> 70%.|$|E

Indeed, marine ascaridoids are the etiological agents of the fish-borne zoonosis anisakidosis. Due to an increase of new cases reported worldwide, a continuous monitoring of infection in fish is mandatory. The study was aimed to evaluate the risk of infection by larval ascaridoids in fishes from Mediterranean Sea. Two species of fishes among those representing a major potential threat for human health were selected. Epidemiological and molecular study was carried out. At Milan Fish Market, Italy, 179 <b>anchovies</b> (<b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus)</b> and 84 chub mackerels (Scomber colias) caught in different fishing areas in the Mediterranean Sea were sampled and inspected {{for the presence of}} larvae.

40|$|Spawning {{populations of}} European {{sardines}} (Sardina pilchardus) and <b>anchovies</b> (<b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus)</b> have become re-established {{in the southern}} North Sea after a ~ 30 -year absence and now co-occur with sprat (Sprattus sprattus). Consequently, little is known concerning potential interactions among these three species in this region. Based upon parallel cruises conducted in June/July 2005, we compared the larval abundance, size-distributions and biochemical-based condition of these species among 1) nearshore (Wadden Sea) areas and offshore (German Bight) areas that were 2) vertically mixed, 3) frontal zones, or 4) stratified waters. In general terms, larval condition (RNA:DNA) was relatively high at all stations. Although fronts clearly acted to concentrate larvae, larval condition was not necessarily higher. For example 9 % of sardines captured at the tidal mixing front were categorised as starving, while no starving larvae were sampled in the stratified water masses. Habitats of sardine and sprat larvae were similar, whereas anchovies were primarily restricted to nearshore areas. This is the first study examining the potential role of near- and offshore habitats as nursery areas {{and the extent to}} which resource (habitat) partitioning exists among the larvae of sprat and newly established anchovy and sardine in the North Sea...|$|R
40|$|This study {{combined}} {{the analysis of}} fatty acids and stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon {{to test the hypothesis}} that the pelagic food web of the south Catalan Sea has a wasp-waist structure supported by sardines Sardina pilchardus. If this hypo-thesis were correct, most predators would be expected to have stable isotope ratios and fatty acid profiles consistent with those derived from a sardine-based diet. However, this was true only for mackerel Scomber scomber, blue butterfish Stromateus fiatola, all seabirds and oceanic loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta. The values of the DHA/EPA index of neritic loggerhead turtles and striped dolphins Stenella caeru leo alba were also consistent with a sardine/squid diet, but their trophic positions were too high. On the other hand, the DHA/EPA index of most predatory fishes indicated that <b>anchovies</b> <b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus</b> and/or horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus were their main prey. Nevertheless, some amounts of low trophic level invertebrates were likely to be consumed by some predatory fishes, because their trophic positions where lower than expected from a fish-based diet only. The heterogeneous distribution of phytoplankton groups above and below the thermocline during the warm season is hypothesized to be the primary reason for this food web structure, although the strong reliance of some seabirds on sardines is the likely consequence of a massive consumption of discards from fishing boats. In short, there is little evidence for a wasp-waist structure based on sardine, which may explain why the populations of predators fluctuate less than the population of sardines. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Pelagic seabirds obtain {{food from}} oceans where the {{availability}} of their prey changes rapidly both seasonally and spatially. Here, we investigated changes in the trophic habits of the critically endangered Balearic shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus) through the breeding season and tested for dietary differences between sexes and age classes. We analysed δ 15 N and δ 13 C values in blood of adults during the pre-incubation, incubation and chick-rearing periods and of their chicks. Using a two-isotope mixing model, we estimated dietary contributions based on isotope values from potential prey species which included small pelagic species available naturally and demersal fish species available only from trawling discards. Balearic shearwaters showed clear isotopic and dietary variation through the breeding season. During pre-incubation, breeding adults appeared to exploit demersal fish, whereas during the incubation and chick-rearing period, they fed mainly on pelagic <b>anchovies</b> (<b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus)</b> and pilchards (Sardina pilchardus). Similarly, chicks were fed mainly with anchovies, a resource with a high energetic value. This variation in the dietary habits of adult shearwaters during the breeding season was probably related to both natural and fishery-induced seasonal changes in {{the availability of}} potential prey species within their main feeding grounds. However, changes in the nutritional requirements of the shearwaters could also play an important role. Indeed, diet differed between sexes during pre-incubation: females fed less on trawling discards and more on small pelagic fish than males. This sexual segregation in diet could be the consequence of higher nutritional requirements of females during this period. Our study reveals the differential importance of both trawling discards and small pelagic fish species for a pelagic seabird depending on the breeding period and illustrates the importance of considering the entire breeding season when making inferences {{about the importance of}} specific prey in seabird dietary studies. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

40|$|AbstractAnisakid {{nematodes}} {{belonging to}} the species Anisakis pegreffii are distributed {{in a wide variety}} of fishes from the Mediterranean Sea and they are known to cause the human zoonosis anisakiasis. The present study investigated, for the first time, the response of A.  pegreffii larvae (identified to species level by allozymes and mtDNA cox 2 sequence analysis) to the storage temperature of European <b>anchovies,</b> <b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus.</b> The larval motility of A.  pegreffii was studied in 1300 fish specimens, captured from a highly infested area (FAO 37. 2. 1, 43 ° 8 ′N, 14 ° 16 ′E), maintained under different temperatures (2  °C, 5  °C, 7  °C), and examined at different time intervals (immediately after fishing, 24  h, 48  h and 72  h). Parasitological analysis was carried out with the UV-press method. The results showed that the increase of infection values with A.  pegreffii in the fillets of anchovies was statistically positively related to the increase of the temperature (at 5  °C and 7  °C) and time of storage (after 24  h, 48  h, and 72  h). Accordingly, a significant statistical correlation between the increasing of the worm burden in the fillets and a decreasing of A.  pegreffii in the viscera was observed. In contrast, those fish constantly maintained at 2  °C showed no statistically significant variation in infection either in the viscera or the fillets, after 24, 48 and 72  h. In the same batches of anchovies, larvae of the non-zoonotic nematode parasite Hysterothylacium aduncum (identified to the species level by ITS rDNA sequences analysis) were found, but they were never observed infecting the musculature of the anchovies. Our results suggest that temperature plays an important role in the post-mortem motility of A.  pegreffii larvae in anchovies. In addition, the presence of A.  pegreffii in the fillets inspected immediately after their capture indicates that intra-vitam migration may also occur. As a consequence, the importance of the adoption of rules to prevent human anisakiasis, as the deep freezing to − 20  °C for 24  h, was underlined...|$|R

Our results show that the mesozooplanktonic resource is not homogeneous in terms of quality in the Bay of Biscay. During spring, some species and some geographical areas seems thus to be more profitable to predators than others. We argue that the energy density is a key functional trait of mesozooplankton, but the assessment of mesozooplankton quality should be preferentially based on taxonomy rather than on size-classes. We conclude that interspecific and spatial variability of energy density among the mesozooplankton community can have important implications on fish population dynamics...|$|R

In the Spanish Mediterranean area acoustic surveys are performed annually in late autumn and cover the entire continental shelf between 30 and 200 m depth. This survey was initiated to obtain estimates of <b>anchovy</b> recruitment (<b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus),</b> but additionally provide a general overview of the whole pelagic fish community in the study area {{during the time of the}} year it is performed. Our study area has a diverse assemblage of small and medium-sized pelagic fish (up to nine species) and thus we rely on the proportion of species obtained in middle-water pelagic fishing trawls to attribute the amount of echo corresponding to every single species and estimate their abundance. Although uncertainties may arise from many different sources (e. g. transducer motion, target strength, migration) we focus our study on the estimation of overall sampling uncertainty, one of the main contributors to random error. We apply geostatistical techniques to deal with spatial correlation and discuss benefits and pitfalls in their application. Although transitive geostatistics have seldom been used, most probably due to their inability to produce spatial maps of abundance and variance estimations, they constitute a powerful tool to routinely estimate sampling variance and its variation in time in a multi-specific context. They may also help to assess the effects of varying sampling intensity and could potentially be useful to detect possible processing errors, for example, in echogram scrutinizing.
