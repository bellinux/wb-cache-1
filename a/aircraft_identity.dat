50|$|The Commissioner of Defence for Newfoundland was L. E. Emerson. In 1942 he amalgamated the Newfoundland Aircraft Detection Corps {{with the}} Canadian <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Identity</b> Corps.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Identity</b> Corps {{was formed}} in 1940 by Air Vice Marshal George Croil for service during World War II. By the war's end in 1945 it had over 30,000 members.|$|E
50|$|At war's end <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Identity</b> Corps {{volunteers in}} Canada and the Dominion of Newfoundland {{received}} a brass Volunteer Aircraft Observer button and certificate of thanks from Canada's Department of National Defence.

50|$|During {{the flight}} home, Thunderbird 2 is deemed hostile by United States Navy strike vessel USS Sentinel and {{severely}} damaged in a surface-to-air missile attack. Although the Sentinel desists after Jeff (Peter Dyneley) urgently radios Washington, D.C. {{to disclose the}} <b>aircraft's</b> <b>identity,</b> Virgil only narrowly avoids hitting the ocean and is barely able to pilot the stricken machine onto Tracy Island's runway before falling unconscious. While Virgil slowly recovers from his ordeal, Brains (David Graham) organises extensive repairs to Thunderbird 2, which will require weeks to complete.|$|R
2500|$|Furthermore, Indira Gandhi International Airport did {{not have}} {{secondary}} surveillance radar, which provides extra information, such as the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>identity</b> and altitude, by reading transponder signals; instead the airport had primary radar, which produces readings of distance and bearing, but not altitude. In addition, the civilian airspace around New Delhi had one corridor for departures and arrivals. Most areas separate departures and arrivals into separate corridors. The airspace had one civilian corridor {{because much of the}} airspace was taken by the Indian Air Force. Due to the crash, the air-crash investigation report recommended changes to air-traffic procedures and infrastructure in New Delhi's air-space: ...|$|R
50|$|The Royal Air Force Museum Cosford has {{on display}} a {{formerly}} airworthy replica <b>aircraft</b> with the <b>identity</b> C4994.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Identity</b> Corps was a Canadian {{civil defence}} {{organisation}} operating between 1940 and 1945. The corps's {{mission was to}} report suspicious aircraft and guard against German, Japanese, and Italian attack. The use of observers was deemed important because radar was not yet in widespread use.|$|E
5000|$|Organisations {{similar to}} the ROC were formed {{elsewhere}} during the Second World War, including the Ground Observer Corps, (USA), the <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Identity</b> Corps, (Canada), and the Volunteer Air Observers Corps, (Australia). However, unlike the Royal Observer Corps, most of these organisations had been disbanded {{by the end of}} the 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|Myanmar {{national}} insignia (white triangle {{with yellow}} {{field in the}} centre and borders in blue) is usually applied on six positions. The serialling system of Myanmar Air Force aircraft is suggested to serve as both - unit and individual <b>aircraft</b> <b>identity,</b> this could not be confirmed so far, however. Most of the older aeroplanes carried the serials with the prefix [...] "UB" [...] and the numbers in Burmese. Sometimes the serials were outlined in white. Combat aircraft generally carry serials in black.|$|E
50|$|A single Yak-23 was {{acquired}} by US intelligence, via Yugoslavia, in November 1953. It was a Romanian Yak-23 flown by Mihail Diaconu who defected with it. The aircraft arrived disassembled, and was shipped to the Air Force Test and Evaluation Center at Wright Field near Dayton, Ohio. It was reassembled and made operational for several flight tests, during which time it was disguised with U.S. markings. Efforts were made to keep the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>identity</b> secret, and it was flown only in the early morning. On one occasion it was passed on the runway by a formation of F-86's, whose pilots inquired as to the plane's identity. A story was conceived that the aircraft was a Bell X-5, which had a similar layout. At the completion of design and flight evaluations the aircraft was again disassembled and shipped quietly back to Yugoslavia in its original paint scheme.|$|R
25|$|The Catron & Fisk Airplane and Engine Co {{was founded}} in 1917, {{developing}} several aircraft in series including the CF-10, a 22-passenger airliner. The company was reorganized as International, accounting for the <b>aircraft's</b> dual <b>identity</b> as the International CF-10. The 'Spirit of Los Angeles' modified the CF-10 with long range fuel tanks and update Wright Whirlwind engines {{to compete in the}} Dole Air Derby.|$|R
25|$|Another {{fuselage}} was {{for many}} years seen up a tree in an Essex scrapyard before being rescued in the 1980s. The <b>aircraft</b> displays two <b>identities,</b> G-ACBH and G-ADFO and is preserved, still wearing its original paint, at the South Yorkshire Aircraft Museum.|$|R
5000|$|When war was declared, Britain {{expected}} Canada to {{take responsibility}} for defending British North America. In 1939, L. E. Emerson was the Commissioner of Defence for Newfoundland. Winston Churchill instructed Emerson to cooperate with Canada and comply with a [...] "friendly invasion" [...] as he encouraged Mackenzie King to advise the occupation of Newfoundland by the king as monarch of Canada. By March 1942, Commissioner Emerson had restructured official organizations, such as The Aircraft Detection Corps Newfoundland, and integrated them into Canadian units, like The Canadian <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Identity</b> Corps.|$|E
50|$|P.W. Crummey volunteered {{with the}} Aircraft Detection Corps Newfoundland, {{which was created}} by the Commission of Government during World War II. The Aircraft Detection Corps was an all-volunteer {{civilian}} unit meant to observe the Newfoundland coast for suspicious planes and ships. In March 1942, he received a letter from Newfoundland's Commissioner of Defence L. E. Emerson informing him that Aircraft Detection Corps Newfoundland would be administered by the Royal Canadian Air Force as a unit of the Canadian <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Identity</b> Corps. Crummey also received: a letter from Flight Lieutenant H. H. Graham, Officer Commanding No. 1 Group RCAF St. John's; glossaries of airplanes and ships; an identity card; instructions; and a brass pin for his lapel.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1942, the Aircraft Detection Corps volunteers {{received}} manila envelopes with a letter from L. E. Emerson, Commissioner of Defence for Newfoundland stating that [...] "Aircraft Identity Corps Newfoundland" [...] would be reorganized {{as an instrument of}} the Royal Canadian Air Force. In the same package was a letter from Flight Lieutenant H. H. Graham, who was the commanding officer of Torbay Airport (No. 1 Group R.C.A.F. St. John's). The envelope had glossaries of airplanes and ships; an <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Identity</b> Corps identity card and instructions. At war's end the volunteers also received a brass Volunteer Aircraft Observers button for his lapel pin and certificate of thanks from Canada's Department of National Defence.|$|E
5000|$|When {{spotting}} aircraft, observers generally {{notice the}} key attributes of an aircraft, {{such as a}} distinctive noise from its engine {{or the number of}} vapour trails it is leaving. Observers assess the size of the aircraft and the number, type and position of its engines. Another distinctive attribute is the position of wings relative to the fuselage {{and the degree to which}} they are swept rearwards. The wings may be above the fuselage, below it, or fixed at midpoint. The number of wings indicate whether it is a monoplane, biplane or triplane. The position of the tailplane relative to the fin(s) and the shape of the fin are other attributes. The configuration of the landing gear can be distinctive, as well.Other features include the speed, cockpit placement, colour scheme or special equipment that changes the silhouette of the aircraft. Taken together these traits will enable the identification of an aircraft. If the observer is familiar with the airfield being used by the aircraft and its normal traffic patterns, he or she is more likely to leap quickly to a decision about the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>identity</b> - they may have seen the same type of aircraft from the same angle many times. This is particularly prevalent if the aircraft spotter is spotting commercial aircraft, operated by airlines that have a limited fleet.|$|R
50|$|After the {{purchase}} of the trademark rights in 2005, Chairman George Novey unveiled on a Fokker F-27 <b>aircraft</b> PARSA's new <b>identity</b> Air Panama. Shortly afterward, the airline introduced new scheduled services to other regional destinations around Panama and began to acquire turboprop aircraft such as the Saab 340 and the Bombardier Dash 8-300 series, replacing the aging British Aerospace Jetstream 31 and Fokker F27 Friendship fleet.|$|R
40|$|Fig. 1 -History {{of radio}} aids in air traffic control. System (ATCRBS) is a secondary, or beacon, radar {{that grew out}} of the Identification Friend or Foe system. ATCRBS is a {{cooperative}} radar in that it does not rely on the receipt of reflected energy from aircraft. Instead, aircraft cany transponders, which comprise receivers and transmitters. A transponder recognizes interrogations from a radar and transmits a reply. This capability greatly increases the surveillance range of the radar, and enables an identification function when the transponder attaches an identity code to its Mode-A [11 reply. In addition to the identification function, many aircraft connect their altimeters to their transponders so that their Mode-C [l] replies can include altitude information. The ATC system also uses primary, or skin return, radar as a backup to ATCRBS. Controllers responsible for keeping aircraft from colliding on runways and taxiways do so by visual means, sometimes with binoculars. To augment visual surveillance during periods of low visibility, a few airports have a single primary radar. Unfortunately, these radars do not provide <b>aircraft</b> <b>identities</b> and they do not work well in rain. Furthermore, even though they are mounted on top of the control tower, the radars may not have {{a clear view of the}} airport surface; e. g., structures such as hangars and terminal buildings could obstruct the view. ATCRBS radars used for aircraft in flight cannot surveil the airport surface for two main reasons. The first is that ATCRBS transponders have a turnaround delay between receipt of an interrogation and transmission of the reply. The delay causes a range-measurement uncertainty of several hundred feet, which is tolerable in the air where planes are at least thousands of feet apart, but is unsuitable on the airport surfac...|$|R
5000|$|In the then-separate Dominion of Newfoundland, {{there was}} an Aircraft Detection Corps Newfoundland. At {{the behest of the}} Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), the Commissioner of Defence for Newfoundland, L. E. Emerson, amalgamated the Aircraft Detection Corps Newfoundland with the Canadian Aircraft Detection Corps. On March 15, 1942, Emerson {{circulated}} a cummunique stating the [...] "Aircraft Detection Corps Newfoundland" [...] would be organized by the RCAF as a unit of the Canadian <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Identity</b> Corps. One of the letter's recipients was Newfoundland public figure P. W. Crummey, an Aircraft Detection Corps Newfoundland volunteer. Attached to the communique was a letter from Flight Lieutenant H. H. Graham, commanding officer of Torbay Airport (No. 1 Group RCAF. St. John's); glosseries of airplanes and ships; an identity card and procedural instructions.|$|E
50|$|The FAA engaged Lincoln Laboratory of MIT {{to further}} design {{the system and}} it {{produced}} a series of ATC Reports defining {{all aspects of the}} new joint development. Notable additions to the concept proposed by Ullyatt was the use of a more powerful 24-bit parity system using a cyclic redundancy code, which not only ensured the accuracy of the received data without the need for repetition but also allowed errors caused by an overlapping fruit reply to be corrected. Further the proposed <b>aircraft</b> <b>identity</b> code also comprised 24 bits with 16 million permutations. This allowed each aircraft to be wired with its own unique address. Blocks of addresses are allocated to different countries and further allocated to particular airlines so that knowledge of the address could identify a particular aircraft. The Lincoln Laboratory report ATC 42 entitled Mode S Beacon System: Functional Description gave details on the proposed new system.|$|E
50|$|The {{deficiencies}} in modes A and C were recognised quite {{early in the}} use of SSR and in 1967 Ullyatt published a paper and in 1969 an expanded paper, which proposed improvements to SSR to address the problems. The essence of the proposals was new interrogation and reply formats. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>identity</b> and altitude were {{to be included in the}} one reply so collation of the two data items would not be needed. To protect against errors a simple parity system was proposed - see Secondary Surveillance Radar - Today and Tomorrow. Monopulse would be used to determine the bearing of the aircraft thereby reducing to one the number of interrogations/replies per aircraft on each scan of the antenna. Further each interrogation would be preceded by main beam pulses P1 and P2 separated by 2 µs so that transponders operating on modes A and C would take it as coming from the antenna sidelobe and not reply and not cause unnecessary fruit.|$|E
2500|$|South African Airways' [...] "Flying Springbok" [...] logo {{has been}} an {{integral}} symbol of the South African carrier ever since its formation in 1934.

40|$|Traditionally, the {{surveillance}} {{component of the}} air traffic management system {{has been based on}} radar, which consists of two separate systems: primary radar and secondary radar, which both enable the measurement of the aircraft range and bearing to the radar station. Primary radar is based on signals emitted by a ground station simply being reflected off an object and detected by a ground-based receiver. Secondary radar also emits signals, but relies upon a transponder onboard the aircraft to emit a signal itself, modulated among others by a four-digit <b>aircraft</b> <b>identity</b> (Mode A), aircraft altitude (Mode C) and/or 24 -bit unique address (Mode S). Typical accuracies of secondary radar are of the order of 0. 03 NM in range and 0. 07 ° in azimuth. However, no position integrity report is provided. Air traffic density is expected to significantly increase in the future. In order to maintain or enhance air travel efficiency, while maintaining safety, more accurate surveillance systems, with the required integrity, will be required. Automatic dependent surveillance–broadcast (ADS-B) is a new aviation surveillance system, envisioned to overcome the limitations of radar and to enhance surveillance performance and thereby increase airspace capacity. However, its high dependence on external systems such as onboard navigation and communication systems also increases the number of potential points of failure. It is important to understand and mitigate these failure modes before the system can reliably be implemented. The present study emerged as an exploratory research as part of a safety assessment framework development for the ADS-B system. It reviews the ADS-B failure modes, data collection and analysis of ADS-B and its corresponding onboard GPS data. The study identifies a set of failures common to certain aircraft models, with consistent error patterns. A key failure mode was found {{to be associated with the}} navigation data from the onboard GPS. We discuss the identified failure modes and investigate the nature and causes of these failures. The findings highlight some of the deficiencies of the current ADS-B system, which will need to be addressed before the ADS-B system can reliably be implemented...|$|E
50|$|The second {{system is}} the {{secondary}} surveillance radar, or SSR, which depends on a cooperating transponder installed on the aircraft being tracked. The transponder emits a signal when it is interrogated by the secondary radar. In a transponder based system signals drop off as the inverse square of {{the distance to the}} target, instead of the fourth power in primary radars. As a result, effective range is greatly increased for a given power level. The transponder can also send encoded information about the <b>aircraft,</b> such as <b>identity</b> and altitude.|$|R
2500|$|In 2008, 60% of all {{fish caught}} in the EU were caught within British jurisdiction.

There is also monthly rotating aerial surveillance of the entire fishing area under call-sign [...] "Watchdog", with aircraft provided by Direct Flight Aviation. Each <b>aircraft</b> transmits the <b>identity</b> and position of the vessel to squadron ships, which, combined with satellite data from navigational databases which allows the squadron to build a surface picture of fishing activity.|$|R
