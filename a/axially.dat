5|$|A {{characteristic}} that distinguishes Cetiosauriscus {{is that it}} has <b>axially</b> concave summits on the cranial and middle caudal neural spines. Barosaurus differs from it in having a more complex sculpting laterally and ventrally in the caudals; in having a larger humerus-femur ratio; and in having differently developed chevrons.|$|E
5|$|Kohala had two active rift zones, a {{characteristic}} common to Hawaiian volcanoes. The double ridge, shaped <b>axially,</b> {{was active in}} both the shield and postshield stages. The southeast rift zone passes under the nearby Mauna Kea and reappears further southeast in the Hilo Ridge, {{as indicated by the}} relationship between collected lava samples. In addition, the two features align to one another more closely then does the ridge to Mauna Kea, of which it was once thought to constitute a part. The bulk of the ridge is built of volcanic rock with reverse magnetic polarity, evidence that the volcano is at least 780,000years old. Older lava dated from the toe of the ridge was estimated to be roughly between 1.1 and 1.2million years old.|$|E

25|$|No more P.1052s {{were built}} as {{work had been}} {{transferred}} to the P.1067 (Hawker Hunter). The P.1052 {{was part of the}} transition from the straight-winged, centrifugally powered Sea Hawk to the <b>axially</b> powered, swept-wing Hunter.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Scott O’Hearen took {{a patent}} on the Radial turbine blade system. This {{invention}} utilizes {{a combination of the}} concepts of a smooth runner surface for working fluid frictional contact and that of blades projecting <b>axially</b> from plural transverse runner faces.|$|E
25|$|The PPN is {{energized}} {{by the central}} star, causing it to emit strong infrared radiation and become a reflection nebula. Collimated stellar winds from the central star shape and shock the shell into an <b>axially</b> symmetric form, while producing a fast moving molecular wind.|$|E
25|$|In image analysis, {{the forward}} Abel {{transform}} {{is used to}} project an optically thin, <b>axially</b> symmetric emission function onto a plane, and the reverse Abel transform {{is used to calculate}} the emission function given a projection (i.e. a scan or a photograph) of that emission function.|$|E
25|$|According to the Drude {{model of}} {{magnetized}} plasma, {{a more general}} expression which {{takes into account the}} interaction of the carriers with an alternating electric field at millimeter and microwave frequencies in an <b>axially</b> magnetized semiconductor requires the expression of the permittivity as a non-diagonal tensor. (see also Electro-gyration).|$|E
25|$|Turning is a {{metal cutting}} process for {{producing}} a cylindrical {{surface with a}} single point tool. The workpiece is rotated on a spindle and the cutting tool is fed into it radially, <b>axially</b> or both. Producing surfaces perpendicular to the workpiece axis is called facing. Producing surfaces using both radial and axial feeds is called profiling.|$|E
25|$|Systems {{based on}} single point, confocal, or flying-spot time domain OCT, must scan the sample in two lateral {{dimensions}} and reconstruct a three-dimensional image using depth information obtained by coherence-gating through an <b>axially</b> scanning reference arm (Fig. 2). Two-dimensional lateral scanning has been electromechanically implemented {{by moving the}} sample using a translation stage, and using a novel micro-electro-mechanical system scanner.|$|E
25|$|A simple {{centrifugal}} compressor has four components: inlet, impeller/rotor, diffuser, and collector. Figure 3.1 shows {{each of the}} components of the flow path, with the flow (working gas) entering the centrifugal impeller <b>axially</b> from right to left. As a result of the impeller rotating clockwise when looking downstream into the compressor, the flow will pass through the volute's discharge cone moving away from the figure's viewer.|$|E
25|$|An {{axial fan}} {{is a type}} of a {{compressor}} that increases the pressure of the air flowing through it. The blades of the axial flow fans force air to move parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate. In other words, the flow is <b>axially</b> in and <b>axially</b> out, linearly, hence their name. The design priorities in an axial fan revolve around the design of the propeller that creates the pressure difference and hence the suction force that retains the flow across the fan. The main components that need to be studied in the designing of the propeller include the number of blades and the design of each blade. Their applications include propellers in aircraft, helicopters, hovercraft, ships and hydrofoils. They are also used in wind tunnels and cooling towers. If the propeller is exercising propulsion, then efficiency is the only parameter of interest and other parameters like power required and flow rate are considered of no interest. In case the propeller is used as a fan, the parameters of interest includes power, flow rate, pressure rise and efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} {{of the three}} methods here discussed, the mechanics of materials method is available for simple structural members subject to specific loadings such as <b>axially</b> loaded bars, prismatic beams {{in a state of}} pure bending, and circular shafts subject to torsion. The solutions can under certain conditions be superimposed using the superposition principle to analyze a member undergoing combined loading. Solutions for special cases exist for common structures such as thin-walled pressure vessels.|$|E
25|$|Through-feed : This type of {{superfinishing}} is {{used for}} cylindrical workpieces. The workpiece is rotated between two drive rollers, which also move the machine as well. Four to eight progressively finer abrasive stones are used to superfinish the workpiece. The stones contact the workpiece at a 90° angle and are oscillated <b>axially.</b> Examples of parts that would be produced by process include tapered rolls, piston pins, shock absorber rods, shafts, and needles.|$|E
25|$|If a {{reflector}} is <b>axially</b> symmetrical {{and shaped}} so its cross-section is a parabola, {{it has the}} property of bringing parallel rays of light (such as sunlight) to a point focus. If the axis of symmetry is aimed at the sun, any object that {{is located at the}} focus receives highly concentrated sunlight, and therefore becomes very hot. This is the basis for the use of this kind of reflector for solar cooking.|$|E
25|$|Several closed ICR {{cells with}} {{different}} geometries were fabricated and their performance has been characterized. Grids {{were used as}} end caps to apply an axial electric field for trapping ions <b>axially</b> (parallel to the magnetic field lines). Ions can be either generated inside the cell or can be injected to the cell from an external ionization source. Nested ICR cells with double pair of grids were also fabricated to trap {{both positive and negative}} ions simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Fiat Powertrain Technologies {{developed}} a dual-clutch transmission with Magneti Marelli and BorgWarner called Euro Twin Clutch Transmission. Magneti Marelli produces the control system, which integrates BorgWarner's hydraulic actuation module {{into its own}} power and transmission control units. It can handle torque inputs of up to , making it the highest-torque dry-clutch application. Its weight of , including oil and transmission control unit, its three-shaft architecture, especially <b>axially,</b> means it can be installed in several types of B- and C-segment vehicles.|$|E
25|$|In {{absorption}} spectroscopy of cylindrical flames or plumes, the forward Abel transform is the integrated absorbance along a ray with closest distance y {{from the center}} of the flame, while the inverse Abel transform gives the local absorption coefficient at a distance r from the center. Abel transform is limited to applications with <b>axially</b> symmetric geometries. For more general asymmetrical cases, more general-oriented reconstruction algorithms such as Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART), Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM), Filtered Back-Projection (FBP) algorithms should be employed.|$|E
25|$|The song is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of G major and in a 4/4 time signature. The verse features the VII or major subtonic chord that {{was a part of}} the opening chord as an ornament or embellishment below the tonic. Transposed down a perfect fifth, the modal frame of the song though pentatonic features a ladder of thirds <b>axially</b> centred on G with a ceiling note of B and floor note of E (the low C being a passing tone).|$|E
25|$|In {{practical}} helical cone beam X-ray CT machines, {{the source}} and array of detectors are mounted on a rotating gantry while the patient is moved <b>axially</b> at a uniform rate. Earlier X-ray CT scanners imaged one slice at a time by rotating source and one-dimensional array of detectors while the patient remained static. The helical scan method reduces the X-ray dose to the patient required for a given resolution while scanning more quickly. This is, however, {{at the cost of}} greater mathematical complexity in the reconstruction of the image from the measurements.|$|E
25|$|Lenses {{are used}} as {{prosthetics}} for the correction of visual impairments such as myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, and astigmatism. (See corrective lens, contact lens, eyeglasses.) Most lenses used for other purposes have strict axial symmetry; eyeglass lenses are only approximately symmetric. They are usually shaped to fit in a roughly oval, not circular, frame; the optical centres are placed over the eyeballs; their curvature may not be <b>axially</b> symmetric to correct for astigmatism. Sunglasses' lenses are designed to attenuate light; sunglass lenses that also correct visual impairments can be custom made.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculations}} for a nonspherical primary {{are apparently}} {{orders of magnitude}} harder than for a spherical primary. A spherically symmetric simulation is one-dimensional, while an <b>axially</b> symmetric simulation is two dimensional. Simulations typically divide up each dimension into discrete segments, so a one-dimensional simulation might involve only 100 points, while a similarly accurate two dimensional simulation would require 10,000. This would likely be the reason they would be desirable for a country like the People's Republic of China, which already developed its own nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, especially since {{they were no longer}} conducting nuclear testing which would provide valuable design information.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} open cell {{geometry}} is a cylinder, which is <b>axially</b> segmented to produce electrodes {{in the shape}} of a ring. The central ring electrode is commonly used for applying radial excitation electric field and detection. DC electric voltage is applied on the terminal ring electrodes to trap ions along the magnetic field lines. Open cylindrical cells with ring electrodes of different diameters have also been designed. They proved not only capable in trapping and detecting both ion polarities simultaneously, but also they succeeded to separate positive from negative ions radially. This presented a large discrimination in kinetic ion acceleration between positive and negative ions trapped simultaneously inside the new cell. Several ion axial acceleration schemes were recently written for ion–ion collision studies.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of driver, {{commonly}} called a dynamic loudspeaker, uses a lightweight diaphragm, or cone, connected to a rigid basket, or frame, via a flexible suspension, commonly called a spider, that constrains a voice coil to move <b>axially</b> through a cylindrical magnetic gap. When an electrical signal is applied to the voice coil, a magnetic field is created by the electric current in the voice coil, making it a variable electromagnet. The coil and the driver's magnetic system interact, generating a mechanical force that causes the coil (and thus, the attached cone) to move back and forth, accelerating and reproducing sound {{under the control of the}} applied electrical signal coming from the amplifier. The following is a description of the individual components of this type of loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|Mounted in this carrier are {{one or more}} {{pairs of}} {{identical}} pinions, generally longer than their diameters, and typically smaller than the spur gears on the individual half-shafts. Each pinion pair rotates freely on pins supported by the carrier. Furthermore, the pinion pairs are displaced <b>axially,</b> such that they mesh only for the part of their length between the two spur gears, and rotate in opposite directions. The remaining length of a given pinion meshes with the nearer spur gear on its axle. Therefore, each pinion couples that spur gear to the other pinion, and in turn, the other spur gear, {{so that when the}} drive shaft rotates the carrier, its relationship to the gears for the individual wheel axles is the same as that in a bevel-gear differential.|$|E
25|$|Paraboloidal reflectors {{that have}} their centres of mass {{coincident}} with their focal points are useful. They {{can be easily}} turned to follow the sun's motions in the sky, rotating about any axis that passes through the focus. Two perpendicular axes can be used, intersecting at the focus, to allow the paraboloid to follow both the sun's daily motion and its seasonal one. The cooking pot stays stationary at the focus. If the paraboloidal reflector is <b>axially</b> symmetrical and is made of material of uniform thickness, its centre of mass coincides with its focus if {{the depth of the}} reflector, measured along its axis of symmetry from the vertex to the plane of the rim, is 1.8478 times its focal length. The radius of the rim of the reflector is 2.7187 times the focal length. The angular radius of the rim, as seen from the focal point, is 72.68 degrees.|$|E
25|$|The {{modulation}} of {{the radio}} emissions by planetary rotation is traditionally {{used to determine the}} rotation period of the interiors of fluid giant planets. In the case of Saturn, however, this appears to be impossible, as the period varies at the timescale of tens years. In 1980–1981 the periodicity in the radio emissions as measured by Voyager 1 and 2 was , which was then adopted as the rotational period of Saturn. Scientists were surprised when Galileo and then Cassini returned a different value—. Further observation indicated that the modulation period changes by as much as 1% on the characteristic timescale of 20–30days with an additional long term trend. There is a correlation between the period and solar wind speed, however, the causes of this change remain a mystery. One reason may be that the saturnian perfectly <b>axially</b> symmetric magnetic field fails to impose a strict corotation on the magnetospheric plasma making it slip relative to the planet. The lack of a precise correlation between the variation period of SKR and planetary rotation makes it all but impossible to determine the true rotational period of Saturn.|$|E
500|$|These rings can be {{extended}} indefinitely to form a cyclol fabric (Figure 3). [...] Such fabrics exhibit a long-range, quasi-crystalline order that Wrinch felt was likely in proteins, since they must pack hundreds of residues densely. [...] Another interesting feature of such molecules and fabrics is that their amino-acid side chains point <b>axially</b> upwards from only one face; the opposite face has no side chains. [...] Thus, one face is completely independent of the primary sequence of the peptide, which Wrinch conjectured might account for sequence-independent properties of proteins.|$|E

[...] The keel provides an anchor to which a bird's wing muscles attach, thereby providing adequate leverage for [...] [...] Keels do not exist on all birds; in particular, some flightless birds lack a keel structure. Historically, {{the presence or absence of}} a pronounced keel structure was used as a broad classification of birds into two orders: Carinatae (from carina, [...] "keel"), having a pronounced keel; and ratites (from ratis, [...] "raft" [...] — referring to the flatness of the sternum), having a subtle keel structure or lacking one entirely. [...] However, this classification has fallen into disuse as evolutionary studies have shown that many flightless birds have evolved from flighted birds.|$|E
500|$|The astragalus of Veratalpa is {{the largest}} among those from Vieux Collonges that Ameghino {{assigned}} to Talpidae. Although at 4.5mm it is {{about as long as}} his [...] "species A", it is broader, and Hutchison noted the broadness as one of the characters that argue against classification of Veratalpa in Talpidae. Like living moles, it has a broad, flat, and short head, but it forms a noticeably small angle with the body—in actual moles, the head is more <b>axially</b> oriented (i.e., towards the central axis of the foot). The surface of the head that contacts the navicula is less rounded than in moles. The body is low and nearly square and has a diameter of about 3mm. The trochlea—a surface on the body of the bone that articulates with the tibia (lower leg bone)—is not large and pulley-like, as in talpids. There is a small perforation on the lower side of the body. This perforation is larger in Ameghino's other supposed talpids, and Trouessart suggested {{on the basis of this}} feature that the internal parts of the toes were reduced in Veratalpa.|$|E
