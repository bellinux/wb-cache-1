5|$|A {{war with}} Serbia in 1331–1334 proved less {{successful}} for the Emperor when several towns in Macedonia were {{captured by the}} Serbs, led by the renegade Syrgiannes Palaiologos. These gains were only curtailed when the assassination of Syrgiannes {{and the threat of}} a Hungarian invasion forced the Serbian ruler, Stefan Dušan, to seek a negotiated settlement. The subsequent peace treaty concluded between Andronikos III and Dušan was important for the future of Byzantine-Serbian relations. For the first time, the Byzantines recognized the extensive gains the Serbs had made at the Empire's expense in the central Balkans during Andronikos II's reign. In the aftermath of the pact, Dušan also moved his seat, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> his realm's centre of gravity, south to Prilep.|$|E

5|$|After al-Adil I {{seized the}} throne in Cairo <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> the sultanate of the Ayyubid oligarchy, {{the period of}} rivalry between Damascus and Cairo to become capital of the Ayyubid empire commenced. Under al-Adil and al-Kamil, Damascus {{continued}} as an autonomous province whose ruler reserved the right to designate his own heir, but during as-Salih Ayyub's rule, military campaigns against Syria reduced Damascus to a vassal of Cairo. In addition, Ayyub established new rules both in administration and government in order to centralize his regime; he conferred the most prominent positions {{of the state to}} his close confidants, instead of his Ayyubid relatives. His wife Shajar al-Durr, for example, managed the affairs of Egypt while he was in Syria. Ayyub officially delegated his authority to his dead son Khalil and made al-Durr act formally on Khalil's behalf.|$|E

Following the defeat of Crimean and Nogai forces in 1572, oprichnina was wound down <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> the way Russian armies were formed also changed. Ivan IV had introduced a new strategy whereby he relied on {{tens of thousands of}} native troops, Cossacks and Tatars instead of a few thousand skilled troops and mercenaries, as was the practice of his adversaries.|$|E
5|$|Boston College ended Maryland's six-game {{winning streak}} against ranked opponents. With a 7–5record, the Terrapins' postseason bowl game options were also limited. The Eagles secured the ACC Atlantic Division title <b>and,</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> {{a trip to}} Tampa for the ACC Championship Game to face Virginia Tech for the second-straight season. Boston College held the Maryland run to 6 yards, forcing {{reliance}} on Chris Turner's passing ability. It was the second {{game of the season}} the Terrapins were held to negative rushing yards (this had also occurred against Virginia Tech). Turner, however, was able to throw for 360yards, bettering Boston College's total offensive yardage of 318yards.|$|E
5|$|Cards' player-manager Rogers Hornsby chose Alexander {{to start}} Game6, and used him in relief to close out Game7.

In Game7, the Yankees, {{trailing}} 3–2 {{in the bottom of}} the ninth inning and down to their last out, Ruth walked, bringing up Bob Meusel. Ruth, successful in half of his stolen base attempts in his career, took off for second base on the first pitch. Meusel swung and missed, and catcher Bob O'Farrell threw to second baseman Hornsby who tagged Ruth out, ending Game 7 and thereby crowning his Cardinals World Series champions for the first time. The 1926 World Series is the only Series to date which ended with a baserunner being caught stealing.|$|E

The Black Death epidemic hit England; starting in 1348, it eventually killed {{up to half of}} England's inhabitants. From 1453 to 1487 civil war occurred between two branches of the royal family—the Yorkists and Lancastrians—known as the Wars of the Roses. Eventually it led to the Yorkists losing the throne entirely to a Welsh noble family the Tudors, a branch of the Lancastrians headed by Henry Tudor who invaded with Welsh and Breton mercenaries, gaining victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field where the Yorkist king Richard III was killed.|$|E
5|$|Following Asilomar, new genetic {{engineering}} techniques and applications developed rapidly. DNA sequencing methods improved greatly (pioneered by Frederick Sanger and Walter Gilbert), as did oligonucleotide synthesis and transfection techniques. Researchers learned {{to control the}} expression of transgenes, and were soon racing—in both academic and industrial contexts—to create organisms capable of expressing human genes {{for the production of}} human hormones. However, this was a more daunting task than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to the phenomena of split genes and splicing, higher organisms had a much more complex system of gene expression than the bacteria models of earlier studies. The first such race, for synthesizing human insulin, was won by Genentech. This {{marked the beginning of the}} biotech boom (<b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> the era of gene patents), with an unprecedented level of overlap between biology, industry, and law.|$|E
5|$|Following several {{design changes}} to the Ares I and Ares V rockets, the RS-25 was to be {{replaced}} with a single J-2X engine for the Ares I second stage and six modified RS-68 engines (which was based on both the SSME and Apollo-era J-2 engine) on the Ares V core stage; {{this meant that the}} RS-25 would be retired along with the space shuttle fleet. In 2010, however, NASA was directed to halt the Constellation program, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> development of the Ares I and Ares V, instead focusing on building a new heavy lift launcher.|$|E

Despite an unconvincing Welsh display, an enthusiastic crowd of 20,000 watched their country win the game <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> the title, decided by a single try from Bert Gould.|$|E
5|$|He was {{replaced}} by former player Billy Bonds. In Bonds' first full season, 1990–91, West Ham again secured promotion to Division One. Now back in the top flight, Bonds saw West Ham through {{one of their most}} controversial seasons. With the club planning to introduce a bond scheme, there was crowd unrest. West Ham finished last and were relegated back to Division Two after only one season. However, they rebounded strongly in 1992–93. With Trevor Morley and Clive Allen scoring 40 goals, they guaranteed themselves second place {{on the last day of}} the season with a 2–0 home win against Cambridge United, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> promotion to the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|His life <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> his reign, {{which were}} {{longer than any}} other British monarch before him, were marked {{by a series of}} {{military}} conflicts involving his kingdoms, {{much of the rest of}} Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War, becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, many of Britain's American colonies were soon lost in the American War of Independence. Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.|$|E

5|$|In May 1969, {{discontent with}} Krieger's {{economic}} policies led to riots {{in the cities}} of Corrientes, Rosario and Córdoba. Krieger was removed, but the Onganía administration was unable to agree on an alternative economic policy. By 1970, the authorities were no longer capable of maintaining wage restraints, leading to a wage-price spiral. As the economy started to languish and import substitution industrialization ran out of steam, urban migration slowed. Per capita income fell, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> the standard of living. Perón’s third term of office was characterized by an expansive monetary policy, which resulted in an uncontrolled rise {{in the level of}} inflation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1370s, Carrouges IV married Jeanne de Tilly, a {{daughter}} of the Lord of Chambois whose dowry included lands and rents vital to Carrouges' ambition of expanding his family estates. Shortly after their wedding Jeanne {{gave birth to a}} son, whose godfather was a neighbour and close friend of de Carrouges, Squire Jacques Le Gris. In 1377, Pierre d'Alençon inherited his brother Robert's county of Perche <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> the castle of Bellême. In addition, he gained the fealty of his brother's vassals, including the Carrouges father and son as well as Jacques Le Gris. The younger Carrouges and Le Gris soon joined the court circle of the Count, centered around the town of Argentan.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{appointment}} of Herbert Chapman in 1925 that Arsenal had their first period of major success; Chapman modernised and reformed the club's practices and tactics, and under him and his successor George Allison (who took over after Chapman's death in January 1934), Arsenal won five First Division titles and two FA Cups in the 1930s. After the Second World War, Tom Whittaker continued the success, leading the club to two First Division titles and an FA Cup. After Whittaker's death Arsenal's fortunes gradually declined; by 1966, they were in mid-table obscurity and had not won a trophy in thirteen years. This led to the dismissal of Billy Wright as manager in 1966, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> the appointment of Bertie Mee, who would go on to turn around the club's fortunes.|$|E
