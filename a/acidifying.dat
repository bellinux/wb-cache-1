25|$|In the {{treatment}} of mountain sickness, acetazolamide forces the kidneys to excrete bicarbonate, the conjugate base of carbonic acid.

40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} may {{be critical}} {{to the maintenance of}} viable populations under future environmental change. Here we examined the role of behavioural avoidance of sub-optimal conditions in enabling the intertidal gastropod, Bembicium auratum, to persist in mangrove forests affected by the low pH runoff from acid sulphate soils (ASS). Behaviourally, the gastropod may be able to avoid periods of particularly high acidity by using pneumatophores and/or mangrove trunks to vertically migrate above the water line or by retreating into its shell. We hypothesised that (1) B. auratum would display greater and more rapid vertical migration out of <b>acidified</b> than reference estuarine waters, and (2) responses would be more pronounced in gastropods collected from <b>acidified</b> than reference sites. Gastropods from <b>acidified</b> sites showed significantly higher activity in and more rapid migration out of <b>acidified</b> waters of pH 6. 2 - 7. 0, than reference waters or waters of pH < 5. 0. Gastropods from reference locations showed a significantly weaker response to <b>acidified</b> water than those from <b>acidified</b> waters, and which did not significantly differ from their response to reference water. At extremely low pHs, < 5. 0, a higher proportion of both <b>acidified</b> and reference gastropods retreated into their shell than at higher pHs. Both the migration of gastropods out of <b>acidified</b> waters and retraction into their shells serves to reduce exposure time to <b>acidified</b> waters and may reduce the impact of this stressor on their populations. The stronger response to acidification of gastropods from populations previously exposed to this stressor suggests that the response may be learned, inherited or induced over multiple exposures. Our study adds to growing evidence that estuarine organisms may exhibit considerable physiological and behaviour adaptive capacity to acidification. The potential for such adaptive capacity should be incorporated into studies seeking to forecast impacts to marine organisms of environmental change. 9 page(s...|$|R

2500|$|Once activated, osteoclasts move {{to areas}} of microfracture {{in the bone}} by chemotaxis. Osteoclasts lie in a small cavity called Howship's lacunae, formed from the {{digestion}} of the underlying bone. The sealing zone is the attachment of the osteoclast's plasma membrane to the underlying bone. Sealing zones are bounded by belts of specialized adhesion structures called podosomes. Attachment to the bone matrix is facilitated by integrin receptors, such as αvβ3, via the specific amino acid motif Arg-Gly-Asp in bone matrix proteins, such as osteopontin. The osteoclast releases hydrogen ions through the action of carbonic anhydrase (H2O + CO2 → HCO3− + H+) through the ruffled border into the resorptive cavity, <b>acidifying</b> and aiding dissolution of the mineralized bone matrix into Ca2+, H3PO4, H2CO3, water and other substances.

2500|$|The drug {{acetazolamide}} (trade name Diamox) {{may help}} some people making a rapid ascent to sleeping altitude above , {{and it may}} also be effective if started early in the course of AMS. Acetazolamide can be taken before symptoms appear as a preventive measure at a dose of 125mg twice daily. The Everest Base Camp Medical Centre cautions against its routine use as a substitute for a reasonable ascent schedule, except where rapid ascent is forced by flying into high altitude locations or due to terrain considerations. The Centre suggests a dosage of 125mg twice daily for prophylaxis, starting from 24 hours before ascending until a few days at the highest altitude or on descending; with 250mg twice daily recommended for treatment of AMS. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest the same dose for prevention of 125mg acetazolamide every 12 hours. Acetazolamide, a mild diuretic, works by stimulating the kidneys to secrete more bicarbonate in the urine, thereby <b>acidifying</b> the blood. This change in pH stimulates the respiratory center to increase the depth and frequency of respiration, thus speeding the natural acclimatization process. An undesirable side-effect of acetazolamide is a reduction in aerobic endurance performance. Other minor side effects include a tingle-sensation in hands and feet. [...] Although a sulfonamide; acetazolamide is a non-antibiotic and has not been shown to cause life-threatening allergic cross-reactivity in those with a self-reported sulfonamide allergy.
