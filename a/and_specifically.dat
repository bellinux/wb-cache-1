5|$|Despite its {{rejection}} {{within the}} scientific community, MacDougall's experiment popularized {{the idea that}} the soul has weight, <b>and</b> <b>specifically</b> that it weighs 21 grams.

5|$|Atwood's use of myths follows archetypal {{literary}} criticism <b>and</b> <b>specifically</b> {{the work of}} Northrop Frye and his Anatomy of Criticism. According to this literary theory, contemporary works are not independent but {{are part of an}} underlying pattern that re-invents and adapts a finite number of timeless concepts and structures of meaning. In The Penelopiad, Atwood re-writes archetypes of female passivity and victimization while using contemporary ideas of justice and a variety of genres.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, {{as part of}} its {{campaign}} for the Three Fs (fair rent, fixity of tenure, and free sale) <b>and</b> <b>specifically</b> in resistance to proposed evictions on the estate, local activists of the Irish Land League encouraged Boycott's employees (including the seasonal workers required to harvest the crops on LordErne's estate) to withdraw their labour, and began a campaign of isolation against Boycott in the local community. This campaign included shops in nearby Ballinrobe refusing to serve him, and the withdrawal of services. Some were threatened with violence to ensure compliance.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to these materialistic views, Aristotelianism considered all natural things as actualisations of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms. This {{was part of}} a medieval teleological understanding of nature in which all things have an intended role to play in a divine cosmic order. Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and were integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond one-for-one with exact metaphysical forms <b>and</b> <b>specifically</b> gave examples of how new types of living things could come to be.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} years {{following}} Anarky's creation, Grant rarely incorporated the character into Batman stories, being reserved for stories {{in which the}} author wished to make a philosophical point.

5|$|MacDougall stated his {{experiment}} {{would have}} to be repeated many times before any conclusion could be obtained. The experiment is widely regarded as flawed and unscientific due to the small sample size, the methods used, as well as the fact only one of the six subjects met the hypothesis. The case has been cited as an example of selective reporting. Despite its rejection within the scientific community, MacDougall's experiment popularized the concept that the soul has weight, <b>and</b> <b>specifically</b> that it weighs 21 grams.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} widely practiced {{treatments}} for speech disorders associated with Parkinson's disease is the Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT). Speech therapy <b>and</b> <b>specifically</b> LSVT may improve speech. Occupational therapy (OT) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in as many of their daily living activities as possible. There have been few studies on the effectiveness of OT and their quality is poor, although there is some indication that it may improve motor skills and quality of life {{for the duration of the}} therapy.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of her visions is {{problematic}} since {{the main source}} of information on this topic is the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure about a witness' oath <b>and</b> <b>specifically</b> refused to answer every question about her visions. She complained that a standard witness oath would conflict with an oath she had previously sworn to maintain confidentiality about meetings with her king. It remains unknown to what extent the surviving record may represent the fabrications of corrupt court officials or her own possible fabrications to protect state secrets. Some historians sidestep speculation about the visions by asserting that her belief in her calling is more relevant than questions about the visions' ultimate origin.|$|E
