5|$|An {{alternative}} <b>airport</b> <b>site</b> to Gardermoen {{was proposed}} at Hurum, south-west of Oslo. Had Hurum been chosen, the Gardermoen Line {{would not have}} been necessary for the airport express train, but the planning documents recommended that construction still proceed to ease traffic congestion north of Oslo. The tunnel is used by all trains on the Gardermoen Line, including the Flytoget airport express, and the regional and express trains which continue via the Dovre Line. Local trains on the Hoved Line and Kongsvinger Line to the north also use the tunnel. Use of the Hoved Line is limited to freight trains and commuter trains which make stops along the route.|$|E

5|$|The {{flight test}} program was {{hampered}} by {{problems with the}} 747's JT9D engines. Difficulties included engine stalls caused by rapid throttle movements and distortion of the turbine casings after {{a short period of}} service. The problems delayed 747 deliveries for several months; up to 20 aircraft at the Everett plant were stranded while awaiting engine installation. The program was further delayed when one of the five test aircraft suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at Renton Municipal <b>Airport,</b> <b>site</b> of the company's Renton factory. On December 13, 1969 a test aircraft was being taken to have test equipment removed and a cabin installed when pilot Ralph C. Cokely undershot the airport's short runway. The 747's right, outer landing gear was torn off and two engine nacelles were damaged. However, these difficulties did not prevent Boeing from taking a test aircraft to the 28th Paris Air Show in mid-1969, where it was displayed to the public for the first time. The 747 received its FAA airworthiness certificate in December 1969, clearing it for introduction into service.|$|E

25|$|The site {{originally}} chosen was Arlington Farms {{which had}} a roughly pentagonal shape, so the building was planned accordingly as an irregular pentagon.

There is one long-stay car park serving Terminals 1 and 3 and a separate dedicated long-stay car park for Terminal 2.

This is a cheaper alternative to the on-site car parks and is served by a 24-hour shuttle bus every 15 minutes.

The former is represented by its state-level counterpart, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), which has shared data with it, participated in the planning process and works with local communities to protect wildlife habitat. Among the latter, the local and state Audubon Society chapters advocated strongly for the area's protection, since the society had declared the <b>airport</b> <b>site</b> an Important Bird Area in 1998. Other organizations have played supporting roles by helping to perform management tasks and raising awareness. There is a Friends of Shawangunk Grasslands National Wildlife Refuge, which was formed in 2017. This refuge is staffed by two FWS volunteers.|$|E
25|$|The Swan Island Municipal Airport was a joint civil-military airport {{that was}} {{operational}} in the Overlook neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. It opened officially in 1927, but the United States Postal Service {{had been using}} the field for a year. After the Portland–Columbia Super Airport was completed in the late 1930s, Swan Island Municipal Airport had little use since its runways were too small for newer aircraft and the low altitude {{made it difficult to}} land and take-off. It was operational for nearly two decades, but {{due in part to the}} advances in aviation, the airport became obsolete soon after its construction. During World War II, the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation was located at Swan Island and when they became obsolete after the war was over the Port of Portland built a dry dock on the <b>airport</b> <b>site</b> which continues to serve as one of their facilities.|$|E
