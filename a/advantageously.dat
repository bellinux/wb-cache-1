5|$|The Liverpool and Manchester Railway {{had opened}} the {{previous}} year, and proved a remarkable success in abstracting traffic from the parallel canal, and indicated that longer distances, not merely feeders to a harbour or from a colliery, could be dealt with, and everywhere business people were considering where a railway might <b>advantageously</b> be built next. When the Grand Junction Railway was authorised in 1833, {{it was possible to}} consider that railways might one day link central Scotland and the south of England.|$|E

His family's wealth enabled him to attend the independent St Peter's School, York. Such wealth had arisen after Terry's of York had <b>advantageously</b> relocated to St Helen's Square, in the centre of York, with business benefiting from the City's intake of 30,000 shoppers and tourists daily as a result of significant developments in rail travel.|$|E
5|$|Ultimate {{released}} Knight Lore {{third in}} the Sabreman series despite having completed it first. The Stamper brothers withheld its release for a year to position the company <b>advantageously</b> {{in anticipation of the}} game's effect on the market. Knight Lore novel image masking technique, Filmation, let images appear to pass atop and behind each other without their contents colliding. This created the illusion of depth priority, which the computer did not natively support. By delaying Knight Lore release, Ultimate protected sales of their upcoming Sabre Wulf and created another Filmation game before other developers could copy the style. Ultimate released the original Sabreman trilogy in quick succession in 1984 for the ZX Spectrum. Knight Lore came last, in November. Ports followed for the BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC, MSX, and Famicom Disk System. The game was later included in compilations including Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|Various {{morphological}} {{features of}} galaxies can affect {{their potential for}} habitability. Spiral arms, for example, are the location of star formation, but they contain numerous giant molecular clouds and a high density of stars that can perturb a star's Oort cloud, sending avalanches of comets and asteroids toward any planets further in. In addition, the high density of stars and rate of massive star formation can expose any stars orbiting within the spiral arms for too long to supernova explosions, reducing their prospects for the survival and development of life. Considering these factors, the Sun is <b>advantageously</b> placed within the galaxy because, {{in addition to being}} outside a spiral arm, it orbits near the corotation radius, maximizing the interval between spiral-arm crossings.|$|E
5|$|France, {{friendly}} towards both Russia and Austria, {{suggested a}} series of territorial adjustments, in which Austria would be compensated by parts of Prussian Silesia, and Prussia in turn would receive Polish Ermland (Warmia) {{and parts of the}} Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a Polish fief already under Baltic German hegemony. King Frederick II of Prussia had no intention of giving up Silesia, gained recently in the Silesian Wars. He was, however, also interested in finding a peaceful solution– his alliance with Russia would draw him into a potential war with Austria, and the Seven Years' War had left Prussia's treasury and army weakened. He was also interested in protecting the weakening Ottoman Empire, which could be <b>advantageously</b> utilized {{in the event of a}} Prussian war either with Russia or Austria. Frederick's brother, Prince Henry, spent the winter of 1770–71 as a representative of the Prussian court at Saint Petersburg. As Austria had annexed 13 towns in the Hungarian Szepes region in 1769 (violating the Treaty of Lubowla), Catherine II of Russia and her advisor General Ivan Chernyshyov suggested to Henry that Prussia claim some Polish land, such as Ermland. After Henry informed Frederick of the proposal, the Prussian monarch suggested a partition of the Polish borderlands by Austria, Prussia, and Russia, with the largest share going to the party most weakened by the recent changes in balance of power, Austria. Thus Frederick attempted to encourage Russia to direct its expansion towards weak and dysfunctional Poland instead of the Ottomans. Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz counter-proposed that Prussia take lands from Poland in return for relinquishing Silesia to Austria, but this plan was rejected by Frederick.|$|E

Nc-Si has about the same bandgap as c-Si and nc-Si and a-Si can <b>advantageously</b> be combined in thin layers, creating a layered cell called a tandem cell.

25|$|In many respects, anion–π {{interaction}} {{is the opposite}} of cation–π interaction, although the underlying principles are identical. Significantly fewer examples are known to date. In order to attract a negative charge, the charge distribution of the π system has to be reversed. This is achieved by placing several strong electron withdrawing substituents along the π system (e. g. hexafluorobenzene). The anion–π effect is <b>advantageously</b> exploited in chemical sensors for specific anions.|$|E
25|$|As the Siamese {{were using}} the Thonburi {{fortress}} <b>advantageously,</b> the French decided to launch an attack against it and destroy it. A detachment of 30 men was sent, on two longboats led by an ensign. The French were overwhelmed by the Siamese forces, however, and although several had managed to scale the ramparts, they soon had to jump from it. Four French soldiers were killed on the spot, and four later died from their wounds.|$|E

25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} the NSW men are {{improving}} a good deal... They cannot be blamed for the farce, for it was nothing else. If the Australian team depends on Queenslanders to strengthen it, one is afraid it will be found wanting. They are quite the weakest lot of footballers I have even seen come down from Queensland. The play needs no detailed description as it was simply a practice match for NSW, and certainly did not <b>advantageously</b> advertise the new game.|$|E
25|$|The {{country is}} rich and fertile, and the farms {{appear to have}} been <b>advantageously</b> cultivated, but it now has the marks of a country in ruins, {{a large portion of the}} proprietors having {{abandoned}} their homes. On the high road where heretofore was a continuous stream of travelers and vehicles, not a single traveler was seen from week to week, month to month. The countryside was silent. The very tracks of the carriages were grown over with grass or weeds. Travelers walked along bypaths. The villages are abandoned, the residents having fled to the north, leaving their homes, where possible, in charge of elder persons and servants.|$|E
25|$|A legal {{strategy}} {{also plays}} an important role in the comprehensive campaign. Part of the legal strategy may use labor laws to cause the employer to divert management resources to employee relations and away from the anti-union effort. This may involve the strategic filing of unfair labor practice charges or grievances, picketing, leafleting or bannering. Advantage is often taken of workplace health and safety laws, with unions filing health and safety or environmental complaints against the employer. Business and professional licensure, zoning procedures, building permitting and other laws and regulations may also be <b>advantageously</b> (and legitimately) used to hinder, harass and influence the employer to recognize the union, negotiate a contract, or achieve other goals.|$|E
500|$|The player {{must use}} {{resource}} management to survive. Items that help sustain the player, {{such as food}} and healing items, are in limited supply, and the player must {{figure out how to}} use these most <b>advantageously</b> in order to survive in the dungeon. USGamer further considers [...] "stamina decay" [...] as another feature related to resource management. The player's character constantly needs to find food to survive or will die from hunger, which prevents the player from exploiting health regeneration by simply either passing turns {{for a long period of}} time or fighting very weak monsters at low level dungeons. Rich Carlson, one of the creators of an early roguelike-like Strange Adventures in Infinite Space, called this aspect a sort of [...] "clock", imposing some type of deadline or limitation on how much the player can explore and creating tension in the game.|$|E

Captain Wai landed at Red Beach, Leyte, {{in the face}} of accurate, concentrated enemy fire from gun positions <b>advantageously</b> located in a palm grove bounded by submerged rice paddies. Finding the first four waves of American soldiers leaderless, disorganized, and pinned down on the open beach, he immediately assumed command. Issuing clear and concise orders, and disregarding heavy enemy machine gun and rifle fire, he began to move inland through the rice paddies without cover. The men, inspired by his cool demeanor and heroic example, rose from their positions and followed him. During the advance, Captain Wai repeatedly determined the locations of enemy strong points by deliberately exposing himself to draw their fire. In leading an assault upon the last remaining Japanese pillbox in the area, he was killed by its occupants. Captain Wai's courageous, aggressive leadership inspired the men, even after his death, to advance and destroy the enemy. His intrepid and determined efforts were largely responsible for the rapidity with which the initial beachhead was secured. Captain Wai's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{he always}} {{saw himself as}} a {{specialist}} bowler, Trueman was an outstanding fielder and a useful late order batsman.

Warr says Trueman was a [...] "brilliant ambidextrous thrower" [...] and he [...] "made life very easy for his captain to place him <b>advantageously</b> in the field". Though he had some talent as a batsman, Trueman never aspired to becoming a genuine all-rounder. He lacked the necessary consistency as he batted primarily to entertain but he had a good defensive technique with a range of attacking strokes which he would employ boldly. His batting consistency did improve in later years and he scored three first-class centuries.|$|E

He would buy coins locally from the public and from other collectors and then sell them at the coin club and to collectors he met there. In the early years, becoming a dealer had its challenges as there were no guides to use as a reference. One of the risks included the authenticity of a coin, while another point of tension was condition.

2500|$|In 1914, Schiele {{glimpsed the}} sisters Edith and Adéle Harms, {{who lived with}} their parents {{across the street from}} his studio in the Viennese {{district}} of Hietzing, 101 Hietzinger Hauptstraße. They were a middle-class family and Protestant by faith; their father was a master locksmith. In 1915, Schiele chose to marry the more socially acceptable Edith, but had apparently expected to maintain a relationship with Wally. However, when he explained the situation to Wally, she left him immediately and never saw him again. This abandonment led him to paint Death and the Maiden, where Wally's portrait is based on a previous pairing, but Schiele's is newly struck. (In February 1915, Schiele wrote a note to his friend Arthur Roessler stating: [...] "I intend to get married, <b>advantageously.</b> Not to Wally.") Despite some opposition from the Harms family, Schiele and Edith were married on 17 June 1915, the anniversary of the wedding of Schiele's parents.|$|E

2500|$|Ahmad Tohari {{published}} his trilogy of novels of [...] "The Dancer" [...] in 1981, following {{the aftermath of}} the Indonesian mass killings in 1965. [...] His publications of the novels took place during the Suharto Regime, and under great scrutiny, was validated as an Indonesian novel. [...] Within his novel, the village of Paruk unfortunately goes through a myriad of poverty-induced situations, due to its bizarre cultural traditions and its inessential need to understand the world around them. Tohari uses the village of Paruk to symbolize the Indonesian citizen’s lack of awareness of how the situation of the mass killings came about, and how they essentially became the scapegoats of the entire incident. As the poverty of Paruk became significantly worse, so did the understanding of the killings itself. Representations of the killings in novels like Tohari’s serves to remind others a side of history in which factual evidence cannot determine. [...] Like most of all the information surrounding the Indonesian mass killings, there are biases, in which the identification of a factual evidence is unfortunately construed.
