2500|$|At 2:30 pm Napoleon {{decided to}} launch the decisive blow. The reserve {{artillery}} was brought forward and placed in battery beside the guns belonging to Victor's divisions and the Guard. Under the orders of Drouot, 88 guns pummeled the Russian infantry with grapeshot. The divisions of Friant and Curial pressed forward, supported by cavalry. By 3:00 pm, the 2nd and 6th Jäger Regiments abandoned <b>Ailles</b> to Pierre Boyer's division. Napoleon appointed Augustin Daniel Belliard to replace the wounded Grouchy and switched the cavalry divisions of Roussel d'Hurbal and Colbert to the French left flank. Earlier, Napoleon asked Charpentier to take command of Victor's corps. Four French cannons astride the main road were particularly effective in punishing the withdrawing Russian infantry.|$|R
2500|$|At 8:00 am on 7 March, Vorontsov {{deployed}} his corps facing east {{in three}} lines, spaced [...] apart. The first Russian line was [...] long and {{a distance of}} [...] west of Heurtebise Farm. The first line consisted of 14 battalions of Nikolay Vasilyevich Vuich's 24th Division, Mikhail Ponset's brigade of the 14th Division and the 13th Jägers. On {{the right of the}} first line were the Pavlovgrad Hussars and four Cossack regiments under Alexander Christoforovich Benkendorf. The 14th Jägers held the Heurtebise Farm and drew up in skirmish formation in front of the first line. The advance force was led by Afanasy Ivanovich Krasovsky and included two squadrons of the Pavlovgrad Hussars on the jägers' right. The village of <b>Ailles</b> on the left flank was held by skirmishers.|$|R

2500|$|The Russians {{fell back}} in good order to a {{position}} [...] southwest of <b>Ailles.</b> At 4:00 pm Vorontsov withdrew again to the hamlet of Troyan near Cerny. Alexey Petrovich Nikitin prepared an ambush with 36 guns from Sacken's corps. When the 6th Jägers fell back through their position, Nikitin's guns opened a deadly fire on the pursuing French. Vasilshikov's cavalry intervened just as Benkendorf's horsemen {{were on the verge}} of being overwhelmed by the cavalry of Exelmans, Pac and Laferrière. Seeing Colbert's horsemen swarming around several Russian infantry squares, Vasilshikov ordered Sergey Nicolaevich Lanskoy to lead the Mariopol and Alexandria Hussar Regiments to charge. This attack drove off Colbert's troopers but the Russian hussars were in turn driven back by Nansouty's cavalrymen. Vasilshiov sent forward three dragoon regiments and Nansouty's cavalrymen were stopped as Lanskoy's hussars rallied in the rear.|$|R
5000|$|On 27 February, Napoleon {{followed}} Blucher's army {{which had}} moved northwest toward Meaux. At this time, Gruyer's brigade, under Boyer, {{was attached to}} Napoleon's army. Boyer's other brigade {{was left in the}} south with the army of Marshal Jacques MacDonald. Boyer's brigade was involved in a skirmish with Russian forces on 6 March. The next day during the Battle of Craonne, Boyer's brigade operated with Marshal Michel Ney's Young Guard corps. That morning Ney prematurely launched the divisions of Boyer and Claude Marie Meunier against the Russian left flank. Because Ney failed to provide artillery support, the initial attacks failed. When the French guns arrived, Meunier and Boyer's troops fought a costly battle with their enemies for several hours. At 2:30 pm, Boyer's men finally captured the village of <b>Ailles</b> on the extreme French right flank. For the rest of the day, Boyer followed up the Russian withdrawal.|$|R

At the Battle of Craonne on 7 March, Ney {{attacked}} prematurely {{on the right}} flank without artillery support, throwing Meunier's division at the Chemin des Dames ridge near <b>Ailles</b> around 9:00 am. Consequently, the 1st Young Guard Division suffered heavy losses. At 11:30 am after the French guns belatedly began bombarding the Russian position, Ney personally led Meunier's depleted division forward and they secured a foothold on the high ground. Despite cavalry support, Meunier's troops were driven off the ridge at 1:00 pm, but an hour later they won another foothold. As the Russians stubbornly retreated, Ney's survivors followed. At this time the 1st Young Guard Division was reduced to 865 men. Meunier {{was wounded in the}} right arm during the battle. During the Battle of Laon on 9 March, Ney's corps fought all day over the hamlet of Semilly, capturing it and being driven out more than once. The attack on Semilly was continued on 10 March before Napoleon was finally convinced that he must retreat.|$|R
2500|$|At 9:00 am, the French Imperial Guard {{artillery}} unlimbered on {{the east}} end of the Chemin des Dames ridge and opened fire. The Russian artillery replied, but the range was , too long to inflict much damage on either side. Blucher was with Vorontsov until 10:00 am when he rode off to learn the whereabouts of Wintzingerode's column. Ney had been told to wait for the order to attack, but the bombardment caused him to send his troops forward. He ordered Pierre Boyer to attack <b>Ailles</b> with Meunier advancing on his left. One account stated that Curial's division operated with Meunier's troops from the beginning. Napoleon was partly responsible for Ney's blunder because he did not explain his battle plan to the marshal. Sending his men into the attack without artillery support was Ney's fault alone. The soldiers of both Meunier and Pierre Boyer were stopped in their tracks by the Russian cannons. Boyer de Rebeval's division arrived on the field at 11:00 am, but Charpentier's division was slowed by sleet-covered roads.|$|R

At 11:30 am, Ney's artillery began pounding the Russian left flank and Ney personally led Meunier's men forward {{to the top of the}} slope. Nansouty advanced up the Paissy spur and pushed back the cavalry on the Russian right flank despite being charged by three Cossack regiments and four squadrons of hussars led by Benkendorf. At noon, Boyer de Rebeval attacked and seized the Marion Woods. Early in the action, a bullet hit Victor in the thigh, putting him out of action. On the Russian side, Krasovsky was also quickly wounded and compelled to leave the field. Boyer de Rebeval's advance was carried out by Auguste Julien Bigarré's brigade with Jacques Lecapitaine's brigade in reserve. They were supported by six batteries of Guard artillery plus 12 their own guns. Since Boyer de Rebeval's men were raw conscripts with only 20 days of service their musketry and cannon fire was not very effective.|$|R
