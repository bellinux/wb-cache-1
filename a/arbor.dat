40|$|Dynamic {{remodeling}} of retinal ganglion cell terminal <b>arbors</b> {{has been}} proposed to contribute to formation of the topographically ordered retinotectal projection. To test this directly, the growth of individual terminal <b>arbors</b> was observed in live X. laevis tadpoles using a confocal microscope to visualize their complex three-dimensional structure. During initial development, nasal and temporal retinal <b>arbors</b> covered overlapping tectal areas. Despite subsequent remodeling, the dimensions and positions of the temporal <b>arbors</b> remained relatively stable. In contrast, the nasal <b>arbors</b> grew caudally, as they extended caudal branches and retracted rostral branches. These results suggest that differences in the remodeling of the nasal and temporal <b>arbors</b> lead {{to the emergence of}} retino-topography along the rostrocaudal axis of the tectum. All the terminal <b>arbors</b> were dynamic, including those with stable dimensions, suggesting that continual remodeling of <b>arbors</b> may be a universal feature of neuronal projections...|$|R
40|$|In the kitten, {{as little}} as a week of monocular lid suture during early life causes a {{remarkable}} remodeling of the geniculocortical projections serving the deprived eye (Antonini & Stryker, 1993 a, 1996). While the physiological effects of monocular deprivation {{have been shown to be}} due to competitive interactions between the projections serving the two eyes, it is not known whether these morphological changes are due to competitive interactions or to sensory disuse. We addressed this question by analyzing the morphology of geniculocortical <b>arbors</b> in kittens deprived of patterned vision by binocular lid suture for 1 week or 2 weeks ending at 6 weeks of age. Such deprivation would be expected to affect the afferents serving the two eyes equally, giving neither eye a competitive advantage. The <b>arbors</b> were anterogradely filled with Phaseolus lectin iontophoretically injected into lamina A of the lateral geniculate nucleus. The lectin was visualized immunohistochemically, and single geniculocortical <b>arbors</b> were serially reconstructed in three dimensions. <b>Arbors</b> reconstructed in binocularly deprived animals were compared with <b>arbors</b> serving the deprived and nondeprived eye in animals monocularly deprived by lid suture of one eye for a week and with <b>arbors</b> obtained in age-matched normal controls. Geniculocortical <b>arbors</b> in binocularly deprived animals did not suffer the drastic remodeling of the deprived <b>arbors</b> in monocularly deprived animals. Indeed, <b>arbors</b> in binocularly deprived animals were indistinguishable from <b>arbors</b> in normal kittens or nondeprived <b>arbors</b> in short-term monocularly deprived animals. These results support the notion that competitive mechanisms rather than sensory disuse are responsible for gross morphological remodeling of geniculocortical <b>arbors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Monocular eyelid closure in cats {{during a}} {{critical}} period in development produces both physiological plasticity, as indi-cated by {{a loss of}} responsiveness of primary visual cortical neurons to deprived eye stimulation, and morphological plas-ticity, as demonstrated by {{a decrease in the}} total length of individual geniculocortical <b>arbors</b> representing the deprived eye. Although the physiological plasticity appears maximal after 2 d of monocular deprivation (MD), the shrinkage of deprived-eye geniculocortical <b>arbors</b> is less than half-maximal at 4 d and is not maximal until 7 d of deprivation, at which time the deprived <b>arbors</b> are approximately half their previous size. To study this form of plasticity at the level of individual thalamo-cortical synapses rather than <b>arbors,</b> we developed a new double-label colocalization technique.

40|$|AbstractThe motoneurons innervating {{the fast}} and slow flexor {{muscles in the}} abdomen of {{crayfish}} form morphologically distinct motor terminals. Axons of the fast flexor (FF) motoneurons, which innervate the large (fast) flexor muscle, produce extensive motor terminal <b>arbors</b> with many branches. Axons of the slow flexor (SF) motoneurons, which innervate the thin (slow) flexor muscle, produce small terminal <b>arbors</b> with many fewer branches. To determine whether intrinsic factors contribute to these differences in terminal <b>arbors,</b> we compared regenerating axonal <b>arbors</b> from these two populations of motoneurons. We used an explant of the crayfish nerve cord in which axons from the FF and SF motoneurons regenerate on a homogeneous substrate. We found that regardless of the substrate, FF motor axons produced <b>arbors</b> with a greater total length and a greater number and density of branches than SF motor axons. These differences in regenerated <b>arbors</b> persisted in defined medium {{and in the absence}} of impulse activity, indicating that they result from intrinsic, neuron-specific factors. The greater branching of the FF motor axons may be related to differences in growth cones: growth cones of FF axons were significantly larger with more filopodia than growth cones of SF axons...|$|R

5|$|Several {{performing}} arts groups and facilities {{are on the}} University of Michigan's campus, as are museums dedicated to art, archaeology, and natural history and sciences. Founded in 1879, the University Musical Society is an independent {{performing arts}} organization that presents over 60 events each year, bringing international artists in music, dance, and theater. Since 2001 Shakespeare in the Arb has presented one play by Shakespeare each June, in a large park near downtown. Regional and local performing arts groups not associated with the university include the Ann <b>Arbor</b> Civic Theatre, the <b>Arbor</b> Opera Theater, the Ann <b>Arbor</b> Symphony Orchestra, the Ann <b>Arbor</b> Ballet Theater, the Ann <b>Arbor</b> Civic Ballet (established in 1954 as Michigan's first chartered ballet company), The Ark, and Performance Network Theatre.

5|$|Since the university's {{establishment}} {{in the city}} in 1837, the histories of the University of Michigan and Ann <b>Arbor</b> have been closely linked. The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 {{with the arrival of}} the Michigan Central Railroad, and a north—south railway connecting Ann <b>Arbor</b> to Toledo and other markets to the south was established in 1878. Throughout the 1840s and the 1850s settlers continued to come to Ann <b>Arbor.</b> While the earlier settlers were primarily of British ancestry, the newer settlers also consisted of Germans, Irish, and African-Americans. In 1851, Ann <b>Arbor</b> was chartered as a city, though the city showed a drop in population during the Depression of 1873. It was not until the early 1880s that Ann <b>Arbor</b> again saw robust growth, with new immigrants coming from Greece, Italy, Russia, and Poland. Ann <b>Arbor</b> saw increased growth in manufacturing, particularly in milling. Ann Arbor's Jewish community also grew after the turn of the 20th century, and its first and oldest synagogue, Beth Israel Congregation, was established in 1916.|$|E
