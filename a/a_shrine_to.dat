5|$|During ancient times, Gibraltar was {{regarded}} by {{the peoples of}} the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as <b>a</b> <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope of securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.|$|E

5|$|However, the King did {{not want}} the house himself, and he offered it to his heir-apparent, Beatrice's nephew George, who declined, objecting to the high cost of maintenance. Edward {{subsequently}} extended the grounds of Beatrice's home, Osborne Cottage, to compensate her for the impending loss of her privacy. Shortly afterwards, the King declared to Arthur Balfour, the Prime Minister, that the main house would go to the nation as a gift. An exception was made for the private apartments, which were closed to all but the royal family members, who made it <b>a</b> <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> their mother's memory.|$|E

Kumar, Sinha, Khan, Kapoor {{and most of}} the other cast and crew visited the Dargah Sharif (<b>a</b> <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> the Sufi saint Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer) on Monday morning, 5 August, to pray for the film's success and the well-being of all involved.|$|E
5|$|Psycho {{is based}} on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel of the same name, which was loosely {{inspired}} by the case of convicted Wisconsin murderer and grave robber Ed Gein. Both Gein (who lived just 40 miles from Bloch) and the story's protagonist, Norman Bates, were solitary murderers in isolated rural locations. Each had deceased, domineering mothers, had sealed off a room in their home as <b>a</b> <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> her, and dressed in women's clothes. However, unlike Bates, Gein is not strictly considered a serial killer, having been charged with murder only twice.|$|E

5|$|The Roman {{fortress}} of Deva was constructed from local sandstone, which was quarried {{across the river}} {{to the south of}} the fortress. Traces of the quarry are visible in Handbridge. In the 2nd century, <b>a</b> <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> the Roman goddess Minerva was carved in the quarry for protection, perhaps by the quarry workers. Despite heavy weathering, the figure can be seen holding a spear and a shield with an owl above the left shoulder to symbolise wisdom. There is also a carving of an altar where offerings were left. The only rock-cut Roman shrine still in situ in Britain, the Minerva shrine is a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|Mellitus died on 24 April 624, and {{was buried}} at St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury that same day. He became revered as a saint after his death, and was allotted the feast day of24 April. In the ninth century, Mellitus' feast day was {{mentioned}} in the Stowe Missal, along with Laurence and Justus. He was still venerated at St Augustine's in 1120, along {{with a number of}} other local saints. There was also <b>a</b> <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> him at Old St Paul's Cathedral in London. Shortly after the Norman Conquest, Goscelin wrote a life of Mellitus, the first of several to appear around that time, but none contain any information not included in Bede's earlier works. These later medieval lives do, however, reveal that during Goscelin's lifetime persons suffering from gout were urged to pray at Mellitus' tomb. Goscelin records that Mellitus' shrine flanked that of Augustine, along with Laurence, in the eastern central chapel of the presbytery.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 16–17 April 1941, the London {{terminus}} was badly damaged in an air raid and rendered unusable. Although the LNC continued to operate occasional funeral services from Waterloo station to Brookwood railway station immediately north of the cemetery, the London Necropolis Railway was never used again. Soon {{after the end of}} the Second World War the surviving parts of the London station were sold as office space, and the rail tracks in the cemetery were removed. The part of the London building which housed the LNC's offices survives today. The two stations in the cemetery remained open as refreshment kiosks for some years afterwards but were subsequently demolished. The site of the northern station, serving the Nonconformist cemetery, is now heavily overgrown. The site of the southern, Anglican, station is now the location of a Russian Orthodox monastery and <b>a</b> <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> King Edward the Martyr, which incorporate the surviving station platform and the former station chapels.|$|E

After getting a pizza menu in the mail, the Koiwais order a couple, though one {{turns out to be}} too much for Yotsuba to hold. After an {{announcement}} of an upcoming camping trip, Yanda arrives with various bubble-blowing devices, which they play inside, then outside, with. Yotsuba, Fuka, and Fuka's classmate from chapter 45 go to <b>a</b> <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> pick chestnuts, and Yotsuba learns about burr covers and bug infestations. Koiwai gives Yotsuba her own camera, which she uses to go around taking pictures of people. Yotsuba meets Miura at her apartment building, and they go to Ena's. On the way, a dog grabs her teddy bear and shakes it, making it smell like dog, so they wash it and dry it at the Ayases'. As a result, the bear's ability to speak is broken, so Asagi offers to repair it overnight. Yotsuba spends much of the intervening time sulking about Juralumin's absence until Yanda finally gets a reaction out of her. She goes to the Ayases', where she finds Juralumin repaired.|$|E
5|$|According to anthropologists Richard Gombrich and Gananath Obeyesekere, {{the cult}} of Kali reached Sri Lanka via South India. Although Kali shrines may {{have been part of}} Tamil Hindu temples prior to 12th century CE, the Sinhalese Buddhist {{population}} came to revere Kali as a village demon at least by the 12th century CE. The first known Hindu temple with <b>a</b> <b>shrine</b> <b>to</b> Kali to become popular with the Sinhalese Buddhists is Munneswaram. A myth that has Kali landing at the town of Chilaw, and residing in Munneswaram, has made the temple a popular place of visit for cursing and sorcery purposes. In the early 1970s, the majority of the Sinhalese visitors were there for sorcery purposes, but by the 1990s more than half have been visiting the temple for general veneration purposes, demonstrating the transformation of the deity from a malevolent demigod to a mother goddess. The veneration of Kali has completely overtaken the previously popular veneration of Pattini. Since the 1960s a number of Sinhalese Buddhist shrines dedicated to Kali have sprung up all over the island, especially in urban areas. These are managed by Sinhalese priests who are trance specialists and act as intermediaries between the deity and the devotee while being possessed by the deity. The popular veneration of previously Hindu deities such as Kali and Kataragama deviyo (the latter identified with the Hindu Skanda) have fundamentally altered the rational nature of Theravada Buddhism towards the Bhakti (“Personal veneration of deity”) aspect of Hinduism. Following protests by Buddhist monks and animal rights activist, the government banned the age old custom of animal sacrifices at the Kali temple in 2011.|$|E
