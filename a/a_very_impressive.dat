5000|$|From 1937 to 1940, Scott {{worked on}} the New Bodleian Library, in Broad Street in Oxford. It is not {{generally}} considered his finest work. Needing to provide storage for millions of books without building higher than the surrounding structures, he devised a construction going deep into the earth, behind two elevations no higher than those around them. His biographer A S G Butler commented, [...] "In an attempt to be polite to these - which vary from late Gothic to Victorian Tudor - Scott produced <b>a</b> not <b>very</b> <b>impressive</b> neo-Jacobean design". <b>A</b> later biographer, Gavin Stamp, praises the considerable technical achievement of keeping the building low in scale by building underground, but agrees that aesthetically the building is not among Scott's most successful. Nikolaus Pevsner dismisses it as [...] "neither one thing nor the other".|$|R

They might have won again in 1968, but while in second place, their engine blew and ultimately Nick Nowicki and Paddy Cliff upheld Peugeot's honour by winning the rally.

40|$|D. H. ロレンスの短編 Smile は「笑い」(微笑み) がテーマである興味深い作品である。「笑い」は人間の計り知れない複雑な精神活動を表す情動運動と見なされる。本稿では Smile における「笑い」の描写は「笑いのメカニズム」に照らしても適切であり,また,死んだ妻が起因となって誘発された主人公マッシウの「笑い」は,無意識的な《人間の肉体の領域》に源を発する原初的な活動であるという意味で「肉体性」と同義であることを考察する。D. H. Lawrence 2 ̆ 7 s Smile is <b>a</b> {{short but}} <b>very</b> <b>impressive</b> story whose theme is " laughter" or " smile". " Laughter" may be {{regarded}} as one of the emotional movements of human beings that expresses the complex psychical mechanism of the unconsciousness. In this thesis, we are going to show how appropriate and reasonable Lawrence 2 ̆ 7 s description of " laughter" or " smile" is in the light of the " mechanism of laughter". We will also discuss whether or not Matthew 2 ̆ 7 s laughter and smile provoked by his dead wife, Ophelia, are <b>a</b> <b>very</b> primitive emotional movement and whether their source is in the flesh in a Laurentian sense or not...|$|R
40|$|Paget’s disease A 72 -year-old {{woman was}} brought to our {{emergency}} depart-ment complaining of moderate intensity headache. She had a longstanding history of Paget’s disease and had been taking alendronate. On clinical examination she had good general health conditions. Head enlargement was obvious, and neuro-logical examination only revealed a hearing deficit (which was chronic). A head CT scan was done to exclude acute intracranial catastrophes (figs 1, 2). Headache was controlled with analgesics. The CT showed <b>an</b> unusual, <b>very</b> <b>impressive</b> pattern of bone enlargement. In Paget’s disease, skull bone enlargement usually occurs in an exocentric way, which differs from our case. Hydrocephalus, headache and basilar impression have been reported as possible complications of Paget’s disease 1 – 4 but we {{could not find a}} report or image of cortical structure compression, as in our case.

25|$|The early 8th century saw coinage {{production}} and circulation on <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>impressive</b> scale; greater indeed {{than at any}} other point after the 4th and before the 13th century. Some 2,500 finds of sceattas are recorded from England, particularly the east and the south, allowing study on the finer details of circulation and use. Sceattas were also produced and used in the Netherlands and probably Jutland. Minting places in the Low Countries such as Dorestad and Domburg supplied a significant proportion of the currency circulating in England at any one time, and were among the most important commercial centres in Europe. Sceattas provide invaluable evidence for the vigour with which trade across the North Sea was conducted in the early 8th century.|$|E
25|$|Tom Petersson and Jol Dantzig of Hamer Guitars {{created the}} idea for a twelve-string bass. Tom Petersson {{previously}} had used an Alembic and Hagstrom 8-string basses, and asked Dantzig to make a 12-string bass. The company initially made him a 10-string bass. Following the successful trial use of that bass, the prototype 12-string bass, The Hamer 'Quad', was produced. Petersson later used 12-string basses made by Kids (a Japanese guitar maker), Chandler, and signature models from Waterstone and from The Electrical Guitar Company. During 2015 and 2016, his primary 12-string bass was one of a pair of prototype Gretsch White Falcon basses in all white and also cream / green finishes. They have been said to be envisaged as a future 'signature' production model. His primary choice of 4-string bass is a Gibson Thunderbird, though he also owns <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>impressive</b> array of 4, 5 and 8 stringed basses from other guitar makers.
