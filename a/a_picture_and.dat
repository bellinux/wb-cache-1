5|$|In 1873, {{journalist}} George Alfred Townsend published Washington, Outside and Inside. <b>A</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>and</b> A Narrative of the Origin, Growth, Excellences, Abuses, Beauties, and Personages of Our Governing City, a {{work that}} covered the history of Washington from its inception to the then-present day.

25|$|The Japanese ichigenkin, a monochord zither, is {{believed}} to be derived from the qin. The qin handbook Lixing Yuanya (1618) includes some melodies for a one-string qin, and the Wuzhi Zhai Qinpu contains <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>and</b> description of such an instrument. The modern ichigenkin apparently first appeared in Japan just after that time. However, the honkyoku (standard repertoire) of the ichigenkin today most closely resembles that of the shamisen.|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to create}} a blockbuster, Peckinpah decided to take on Convoy (1978). His {{associates}} were perplexed, as they felt his choice to direct such substandard material {{was a result of}} his renewed cocaine use and continued alcoholism. Based on the hit song by C. W. McCall, the film was an attempt to capitalize on the huge success of Smokey and the Bandit (1977). Addictions or not, Peckinpah still felt compelled to turn the genre exercise into something more significant. Unhappy with the screenplay written by B.W.L. Norton, Peckinpah tried to encourage the actors to re-write, improvise and ad-lib their dialogue. In another departure from the script, Peckinpah attempted to add a new dimension by casting a pair of black actors as members of the convoy, Madge Sinclair as Widow Woman and Franklyn Ajaye as Spider Mike. Filmed in New Mexico and starring Kris Kristofferson, Ali MacGraw and Ernest Borgnine, Convoy turned out to be yet another troubled Peckinpah production, with the director's health a continuing problem. Friend and actor James Coburn was brought in to serve as second unit director, and he filmed many of the scenes while Peckinpah remained in his on-location trailer. The film wrapped in September 1977, 11 days behind schedule and $5 million over budget. Surprisingly, Convoy was the highest-grossing picture of Peckinpah's career, notching $46.5 million at the box office, but was panned by many critics, leaving his reputation seriously damaged. For the first time in almost a decade, Peckinpah finished <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>and</b> found himself unemployed.|$|E

500|$|Dunstan (909– 19 May 988 AD) was {{successively}} Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, Bishop of Worcester, Bishop of London, and Archbishop of Canterbury, later canonised as a saint. His work restored monastic life in England and reformed the English Church. His 11th-century biographer, Osbern, {{himself an}} artist and scribe, states that Dunstan was skilled in [...] "making <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>and</b> forming letters", as were other clergy of his age who reached senior rank.|$|E

500|$|On an {{edition of}} ITV's The South Bank Show in November 1992, Richards commented that Formby [...] "embodied qualities that people admired and found reassuring in the depression... {{and you thought}} that here's a man whom {{whatever}} is thrown at him, will come through and come out smiling—and people wanted that". H.J. Igoe, writing in The Catholic Herald, thinks that [...] "Formby has a common English touch. We warm to the kindly turnip face, the revolving eyes, the mouth like a slashed coconut, the silly little songs... the melodiously tinny voice and twanging banjo. The comedian is the universal works—platoon and bar-room simpleton—mother's boy—the beloved henpeck—the father who cannot hang <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>and</b> underlying his everyday folly there is the sublime wisdom of the ordinary fool who loves and trusts the world. His comedy is earthy, but never lascivious".|$|E

500|$|John {{described}} Romney {{as being}} {{under the influence}} of [...] "some worthless people, who profited by his imprudence." [...] The original house had at the time of Romney's purchase [...] "a very large garden pleasantly situated, and an excellent stable, coach house... situated above the garden on top of the hill." [...] Romney demolished the stable, constructed a new stable on adjoining ground, and built a [...] "whimsical structure, consisting chiefly of <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>and</b> statue gallery" [...] and a [...] "wooden arcade for a riding house" [...] and {{on the site of the}} old stable. [...] In the course of the building works Romney removed some paintings and put them outside, where some were damaged by frost, and others were stolen. One of the pictures damaged was Nature Unveiling Herself to Shakespeare, which had been mentioned in poetry by Helen Maria Williams. The building works cost Romney £2733 (...) [...] The arcade extension later sold for £357 (...) and the original house for close to the £700 purchase price.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{workplace}} flirtation between Will and Emma, Gilsig deemed Terri [...] "a woman of conviction", {{willing to do}} [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to keep Will from leaving her, [...] "even if that means finding this woman and hunting her down". She explained that Will and Terri's communication is weak and that Terri is [...] "missing {{a lot of the}} skills for the marriage", and commented that Terri feels threatened by Will's commitment to the glee club, worried that it will pull him away from her. Gilsig characterized Terri as emotionally still being in high school, and explained: [...] "I think Terri still lives in that world, where I can move the pieces in such a way to create <b>a</b> <b>picture,</b> <b>and</b> that will make it real. I don't think she's learned that you can actually just have open conversations and talk about your fears and ask for your needs to be met in a direct, compassionate way. I think she's still in high school and thinking whatever you do, just don't let anybody know that you don't know what you're doing." [...] Discussing Terri's relationship with her sister Kendra, Gilsig commented: [...] "When Kendra tells Terri to do something, Terri does it. As crazy as Terri might be, she's actually pretty normal in the face of her sister. This [...] is Kendra's brainchild, and she just trusts her implicitly." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} full season with Villa, Bent scored his first goal of the season against Blackburn Rovers in a 3–1 victory on 20 August 2011. In his first match against former club Sunderland, a 2–2 draw at the Stadium of Light on 29 October 2011, every time he {{received}} a touch on the ball, he was booed by the home support. Bent then suffered an injury during the match against Bolton and was out {{for the next few}} matches as a result. Bent caused controversy when a fan posted <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>and</b> claimed the striker was out shopping while his teammates were losing 2–0 to Liverpool. It was later revealed Bent had been sent home to recover from his injury and afterwards he apologised to the Villa fans for his actions. After apologising, Villa manager Alex McLeish reacted angrily to the [...] "conspiracy theory" [...] over Bent's absence for Villa. This led to Bent having to deny a fall-out with McLeish. Bent made his return as a 78th-minute substitute in the match against Chelsea on 31 December 2011, scoring the third goal to seal a 3–1 win at Stamford Bridge. After not scoring in the next two matches, Bent went on a run by scoring in the next four matches for Villa, including his first FA Cup goal in a Villa shirt on 29 January 2012, against Arsenal in an eventual 3–2 defeat. Three days later, Bent scored his 100th Premier League goal as Villa came from behind to earn a 2–2 home draw against Queens Park Rangers. He was the 21st player to reach the milestone.|$|E
