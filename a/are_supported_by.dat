5|$|Where sawgrass grows densely, few {{animals or}} other plants thrive, {{although}} alligators often choose these locations for nesting.

Larval insects and amphibians <b>are</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> periphyton; these in turn provide food for birds, fish, and reptiles. Periphyton also absorbs calcium from the water, which creates marl where sawgrass takes root.|$|E
