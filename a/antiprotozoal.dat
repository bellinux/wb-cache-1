Clioquinol (Entero-vioform) was noted as successful in treatment of Blastocystis infection but removed from the market following an adverse event in Japan. Stovarsol and Narsenol, two arsenic-based antiprotozoals, were reported to be effective against the infection. Carbarsone was available as an anti-infective compound in the United States as late as 1991, and was suggested as a possible treatment. The reduction in the availability of <b>antiprotozoal</b> drugs has been noted as a complicating factor in treatment of other protozoal infections.

CS is a tetramer with the monomer possessing a novel β-α-β fold.

40|$|AbstractHelminth {{infections are}} {{responsible}} for a considerable public health burden, yet the current drug armamentarium is small. Given {{the high cost of}} drug discovery and development, the high failure rates and the long duration to develop novel treatments, drug repurposing circumvents these obstacles by finding new uses for compounds other than those they were initially intended to treat. In the present review, we summarize in vivo and clinical trial findings testing clinical candidates and marketed drugs against schistosomes, food-borne trematodes, soil-transmitted helminths, Strongyloides stercoralis, the major human filariases lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, taeniasis, neurocysticercosis and echinococcosis. While expanding the applications of broad-spectrum or veterinary anthelmintics continues to fuel alternative treatment options, antimalarials, antibiotics, <b>antiprotozoals</b> and anticancer agents appear to be producing fruitful results as well. The trematodes and nematodes continue to be most investigated, while cestodal drug discovery will need to be accelerated. The most clinically advanced drug candidates include the artemisinins and mefloquine against schistosomiasis, tribendimidine against liver flukes, oxantel pamoate against trichuriasis, and doxycycline against filariasis. Preclinical studies indicate a handful of promising future candidates, and are beginning to elucidate the broad-spectrum activity of some currently used anthelmintics.

40|$|Ligand binding to {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR) is discussed. This is an {{extremely}} important enzyme, {{as it is the}} target of several drugs (inhibitors) which are used clinically as antibacterials, <b>antiprotozoals</b> and in cancer chemotherapy. DHFR catalyzes the NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) dependent reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, which is used in several pathways of purine and pyrimidine iosynthesis, including that of thymidylate. Since DNA synthesis is dependent on a continuing supply of thymidylate, a blockade of DHFR resulting in a depletion of thymidylate can lead to the cessation of growth of a rapidly proliferating cell line. DHFR exhibits a significant species to species variability in its sensitivity to various inhibitors. For example, trimethoprim, an inhibitor of DHFR, binds to bacterial DHFR's 5 orders of magnitude greater than to vertebrate DHFR's. The structural mechanics, dynamics and energetics of a family of dihydrofolate reductases are studied to rationalize the basis for the inhibitor of these enyzmes and to understand the molecular basis of the difference in the binding constants between the species. This involves investigating the conformational changes induced in the protein on binding the ligand, the internal strain imposed by the enzyme on the ligand, the restriction of fluctuations in atom positions due to binding and the consequent change in entropy...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{drug use}} in pregnancy, and compare drug use of pregnant women with non-pregnant women with respect to possible teratogenicity. Study design: A cross-sectional study based on pharmacy records from 1997 to 2001 was performed. Pregnant women and matched non-pregnant women (same physician and age) were identified. Prescriptions were set against the Australian risk classification. Results: Thirty-five percent of all prescriptions for non-pregnant women were safe in pregnancy (Australian classification A), in 14 % the risk was unknown (B 1, B 2), 49 % were potentially harmful drugs (B 3, C, D, X), and in 3 % no classification was available. For pregnant women these figures were 86, 3, 10 and 2 %, respectively. In non-pregnant women the highest percentages of prescriptions for unsafe drugs were for psycholeptics (99 % not classified as safe), psychoanaleptics (100 %), anti-inflammatory/antirheumetic products (100 %), antihistamines (94 %), antacids/anti-ulcer drugs (81 %), antiepileptics (100 %), beta-blockers (100 %), systemic antimycotics (100 %), <b>antiprotozoals</b> (97 %), diuretics (100 %) and immunosuppressives (100 %). In pregnant women this pattern was comparable, except for antihistamines (22 %) and antacids/anti-ulcer drugs (3 %). Conclusion: We conclude that many drugs used by non-pregnant women should be avoided in pregnancy, and that pregnant women indeed do so. However, for some drug groups the available safe alternatives are limited. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Taylor & Francis via the DOI in this record. As climate change alters {{environmental}} conditions, the incidence and global patterns of human diseases are changing. These modifications to disease profiles and the effects upon human pharmaceutical usage are discussed. Climate-related environmental changes are associated with a rise in the incidence of chronic diseases already prevalent in the Northern Hemisphere, for example, cardiovascular disease and mental illness, leading to greater use of associated heavily used Western medications. Sufferers of respiratory diseases may exhibit exacerbated symptoms due to altered environmental conditions (e. g., pollen). Respiratory, water-borne, and food-borne toxicants and infections, including those that are vector borne, may become more common in Western countries, central and eastern Asia, and across North America. As new disease threats emerge, substantially higher pharmaceutical use appears inevitable, especially of pharmaceuticals not commonly employed at present (e. g., <b>antiprotozoals).</b> The use of medications for the treatment of general symptoms (e. g., analgesics) will also rise. These developments need to be viewed in the context of other major environmental changes (e. g., industrial chemical pollution, biodiversity loss, reduced water and food security) as well as marked shifts in human demographics, including aging of the population. To identify, prevent, mitigate, and adapt to potential threats, one needs to be aware of the major factors underlying changes in the use of pharmaceuticals and their subsequent release, deliberately or unintentionally, into the environment. This review explores the likely consequences of climate change upon the use of medical pharmaceuticals in the Northern Hemisphere.

Pharmacotherapy with multiple agents before, during and after surgery is marked in present day indoor hospital settings. Irrational prescription may lead to severe postoperative complications. The present prospective observational study aims to evaluate the drug utilization patterns using WHO core indicators and to assess how much it confirms to standard treatment guidelines in the inpatient ward of surgery in a tertiary care hospital, by collecting the admitted cases of surgery as per the study criteria. A total of 104 cases were enrolled into the study for a period of 9 months. The results shown that, majority (43. 26 %) of the surgery cases were in the age group of 21 - 40 years. The majority of patients were males (67. 30 %) compared to females (32. 70 %). Majority of them were from rural area (74. 03 %) and the remaining is from urban area (25. 97 %). The majority of surgeries performed were clean- contaminated (46. 15 %). Anti-microbial agents were the most common class of drugs prescribed (35. 14 %), followed by analgesics (21. 70 %). Among antibiotics, <b>antiprotozoals</b> (33. 33 %) are the most preferred class with Metronidazole(31. 80 %) being prescribed major. Among analgesics, NS AI DS (75. 62 %) a r e t h e most preferred class with Diclofenac (53. 12 %) as major drug prescribed. Tazobactum + piperacillin (33. 33 %) is the major combination of drug prescribed. On an average 7. 09 % of drugs were prescribed per patient and percentage of encounter with an antibiotic was 2. 5 %. Percentage of drugs prescribed by generic name were 7. 19 %, while only 60. 92 % of all drugs were from WHO list of essential medicines. And the percentage of fixed drug combinations from WHO essential drug list is only 7. 05 %. In this study we observed that the prescribing practice for antibiotics, especially use of prophylactic antibiotics is high. Lack of generic name prescribing and low incidence of prescribing medicines from essential drug list are the concerns that need to be addressed.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 29). Opsonin Pharma Limited is a private limited company. Opsonin is committed to improve its position continuously as a Leading Pharmaceutical company in Bangladesh and strengthen its global presence. Opsonin creates value for its customers and other stakeholders by providing highest quality health care solutions through appropriate application and development of resources and processes.. Its main market is in Southeast Asia Africa Eastern Asia. It is involved with manufacturing, distributing and wholesaling. Main products of Opsonin Pharma includes Antihistamines, vitamins and minerals, NSAIDS, Antispasmodics, Corticosteroids, Laxatives, Expectorants, Analgesics, <b>Antiprotozoals,</b> and Anti-diarrhoeals. Opsonin Pharma Limited is renowned for its outstanding product quality, world class manufacturing facilities, product development capabilities and unparalleled services. Environment, health and safety {{are an integral part}} of Opsonin’s corporate responsibility. As a pharmaceutical company, they improve health not only through the production and distribution of medicine to our consumers, but also through our commitment to protect the environment, health and safety of our co workers and the communities where they operate. My internship report on Opsonin Pharma Limited is to study performance evaluation practice of the company finding lacking and corrective actions. In this consideration I have presented the existing practice. Base on Key result area performance of employees is evaluated by the departmental heads. Performance evaluation form is circulated at the end of the year. Form is filled up both the apprise and appraiser. There is a scoring where A (90 and above) stands for outstanding performance. All functional head forward performance appraisal form to HRD. Then HRD summaries the evaluation and make a promotion and upgradation committee. The committee decides the employees entitled for promotion and upgradation. In the performance evaluation of Opsonin Pharma Ltd. I have the following findings:  Though Opsonin Pharma Limited has well-structured policies and procedures for performance evaluation but there are some lacking in the area of setting KRA (Key result area) and properly evaluating employees by the departmental heads.  Though there is a provision for weightage in key performance areas but it is not being implemented due to lack of coordination. Say for example, commercial departments tasks is delayed by non-cooperation of other functional areas. As a result they are not interested to set fix any time frame base on which performance can be evaluated.  Within the fixed time frame performance evaluation is not done due to lack of coordination from other departments that should be improved.  Opsonin Pharma has no formal (written) vision, mission and goals and Organizational Objectives that is a serious issue to be defined. In this regard I have the following recommendation: For evaluating performance properly Opsonin Pharma Should take initiative to redesign job structure as well as Job description, Specification. Opsonin should introduce vision, mission, goals and organization objectives of the organization. After setting organizational objectives we should introduce departmental objectives which will help us to define Key result area. After setting KRA weight should be given and then proper monitoring of an incumbents responsibility should be done through the departmental Heads. Departmental Head should properly introduce with the performance evaluation, setting KPI aligned with the organizational objectives. Md. Samauz ZohaM. Business Administratio...|$|R
