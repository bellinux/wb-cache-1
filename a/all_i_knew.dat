[...] During a February 1993 interview with Soap Opera Digest (SOD), Howarth stated he was surprised he won the part. [...] "I really don't know how I made it," [...] he said. He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he [...] "auditioned just like everybody else". He [...] "made it to callbacks, and [...] got the part". Howarth said, [...] "I was hired... to plant drugs in Jason Webb's jacket. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> was that my first name was Todd. I don't know what happened next. They called me in again and suddenly I had a last name 'Manning.' Then I get called to read another day." ...|$|E

It was hard to write. It was a high order to say, 'I found a way to make you smile.' I had to come up with, 'OK, what are those ways?' That was tough." [...] Of the line, 'I found a way to make you smile', Stipe later recalled, [...] "I just thought, that's the most beautiful thing in the world." ...|$|E

We study how logic <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> can represent complete and incomplete knowledge in Logical Information Systems. In these information systems, a knowledge base is a collection of objects (e. g., files, bibliographical references) described in a logical way, furthermore in the same logic used for expressing queries.

I was new to the life, so I had no reference for what people were talking about, but I soon gathered that [...] "banjee" [...] meant that I wasn't a [...] "queen." [...] Whatever the terms of identification, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> was that there was one thing that brought both the banjees and the queens (and whatever lies between) to the pier: we were men who loved men. An anxious 19 year old, I wore my banjee realness designation like a badge of honor.
