5|$|During the 16th century, Bristol merchants {{concentrated}} on developing trade with Spain and its American colonies. This included the smuggling of prohibited goods, {{such as food}} <b>and</b> <b>guns,</b> to Iberia during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604). Bristol's illicit trade grew enormously after 1558, becoming integral to its economy.|$|E
5|$|In late August {{and early}} September 1943, the {{division}} redeployed again, {{this time to}} Bihać, relieving the 114th Jäger Division which redeployed to the Adriatic coast. The move was difficult, with several significant ambushes resulting in numerous casualties {{and the loss of}} several vehicles <b>and</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|E
50|$|Accident {{statistics}} {{are hard to}} obtain, but much data {{is available on the}} issue of <b>gun</b> ownership <b>and</b> <b>gun</b> related deaths. The United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) has made comparisons between countries with different levels of <b>gun</b> ownership <b>and</b> investigated the correlation between <b>gun</b> ownership levels <b>and</b> <b>gun</b> homicides, <b>and</b> between <b>gun</b> ownership levels <b>and</b> <b>gun</b> suicides. A strong correlation is seen in both.|$|R

5|$|The {{suggestion}} that her building had been sped up by using guns and/or turrets originally {{designed for the}} s which preceded her is not borne out as the guns and turrets were not ordered until July 1905. It seems more likely that Dreadnoughts turrets <b>and</b> <b>guns</b> merely received higher priority {{than those of the}} earlier ships.|$|E
5|$|A production–possibility {{frontier}} (PPF) or {{production possibility}} curve (PPC) is a graphical representation of possible combinations of two goods (such as butter <b>and</b> <b>guns)</b> {{that can be}} produced with constant technology and resources per unit of time, such that more of one good could be produced only by diverting resources from the other good, resulting in less production of it; i. e. production tradeoffs, usually for an economy, but which can also be interpreted as applying for an individual, household, etc.|$|E
25|$|According to {{historian}} George Nafziger, the Allies employed 26,400 cavalry and 128 artillery pieces. Crown Prince Frederick William commanded 2,000 Württembergers <b>and</b> 12 <b>guns,</b> 3,500 Russians <b>and</b> 12 <b>guns</b> in Palen's Cavalry Corps and 1,600 Russians <b>and</b> 12 <b>guns</b> in Kretov's 2nd Cuirassier Division. Nostitz led 3,700 Austrians <b>and</b> 24 <b>guns</b> {{in his own}} Cuirassier Division and two regiments of chevau-légers.

500|$|Run <b>and</b> <b>gun</b> (or [...] "run 'n' gun") {{describes}} a shoot 'em up {{in which the}} protagonist fights on foot, perhaps {{with the ability to}} jump. Run <b>and</b> <b>gun</b> games may use side scrolling, vertical scrolling or isometric viewpoints and may feature multidirectional movement.|$|R
5|$|Brin had {{originally}} {{wanted to build}} three ships, but their great cost forced him to settle for two. At the time, Italy's industrial capacity was insufficient to build the ships out of domestic material. Everything from the iron used to build the hulls to the ships' machinery <b>and</b> <b>guns</b> had to be imported. The Caio Duilio class {{formed the basis for}} the following two ironclad designs, the , also designed by Brin and laid down in 1876, and the , designed by Giuseppe Micheli and laid down in 188182.|$|E
5|$|For example, if {{one assumes}} that the economy's {{available}} quantities of factors of production do not change over time and that technological progress does not occur, if the economy is operating on the PPF, production of guns {{would need to be}} sacrificed to produce more butter. If production is efficient, the economy can choose between combinations (points) on the PPF: B if guns are of interest, C if more butter is needed, D if an equal mix of butter <b>and</b> <b>guns</b> is required.|$|E
5|$|In {{military}} usage, soldiers often either exchange their disruptively-patterned summer uniforms for thicker snow camouflage uniforms {{printed with}} mainly-white versions of camouflage patterns in winter, or they wear white overalls over their uniforms. Some armies have {{made use of}} reversible uniforms, printed in different seasonal patterns on their two sides. Vehicles <b>and</b> <b>guns</b> are often simply repainted in white. Occasionally, aircraft too are repainted in snow camouflage patterns.|$|E

Bowers arrested Calderwood, 18 other miners, and the mayor and town marshal of Altman (who had supported the miners). They were taken to Colorado Springs and quickly tried on several different charges, but found not guilty. Meanwhile, outbursts of violence, such as stone-throwing and fights between union miners and scabs, increased in frequency. Stores and warehouses were broken into, <b>and</b> <b>guns</b> and ammunition stolen.|$|E

5|$|On 1 November 1944 a United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) F-13 Superfortress {{conducted}} {{the first flight}} by an Allied aircraft over the Tokyo region of Japan since the Doolittle Raid in April 1942. This photo reconnaissance sortie was highly successful, with the aircraft's crew taking thousands of photographs which were later used to plan many air raids on Japan during the final months of World War II. Attempts by Japanese air units and anti-aircraft gun batteries to destroy the F-13 failed, as the available fighter aircraft <b>and</b> <b>guns</b> could not reach the high altitude it operated at.|$|E

5|$|The Eyeshield 21 anime {{adaptation}} was co-produced by TV Tokyo, NAS, and Gallop, and {{was directed}} by Masayoshi Nishida until episode 103, and by Shin Katagai from 104 to 145. The series of 145 television episodes aired in Japan from April 6, 2005 to March 19, 2008 on TV Tokyo. In Japan, Bandai Visual distributed the anime in DVD format; thirty-six volumes were released between July 26, 2006 and June 26, 2007. Some changes were done {{in comparison to the}} manga; for example, swearings <b>and</b> <b>guns</b> or gambling references were reduced.|$|E
5|$|The regiment, {{with three}} squadrons of tanks, {{would spend the}} next year in training, {{learning}} to use the signalling equipment <b>and</b> <b>guns</b> of the tanks it was expected to use. One squadron was to be equipped with Crusaders {{with the other two}} squadrons operating Shermans. However, the mechanically unreliable Crusaders were later replaced with Shermans. Burrows initially oversaw the transition to armour until he returned to New Zealand on furlough in May 1943 and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel J. W. McKergow.|$|E
5|$|They {{relieved}} {{elements of}} the Royal Naval Brigade, with the regiment taking over from the Nelson and Deal Battalions, on the right flank. One squadron occupied the front line, one squadron the support trench, and the third was the reserve. The regiment was on the left, the Auckland Mounted Rifles in the centre, and the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on the right. They spent {{the next few days}} improving the fire trenches, constructing communications trenches, and enlarging tracks so men <b>and</b> <b>guns</b> could move forward quickly. This was done under Turkish machine-gun and rifle fire.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{proposals}} {{were made in}} the 1900s to reconstruct them and replace their obsolete armor <b>and</b> <b>guns,</b> but none of these were carried out. Ekaterina II and Chesma were both eventually sunk as target ships after being decommissioned in 1907, but both Sinop and Georgii Pobedonosets were converted into artillery training ships before becoming guardships at Sevastopol before World War I. There they spent most of the war and were captured by the Germans in 1918, who eventually turned them over to the British who sabotaged their engines when they abandoned the Crimea in 1919. Immobile they were captured by both the Whites and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. Sinop was abandoned when Wrangel's fleet sailed for Bizerte, but Georgii Pobedonosets was towed there. Sinop was scrapped beginning in 1922 by the Soviets while Georgii Pobedonosets was eventually scrapped in Bizerte beginning in 1930 by the French.|$|E
5|$|After {{escaping}} from custody, Roger uses Billy {{to communicate and}} send scripts to Penny. When rewriting one of the programs, Gork: Son of Fire, Roger attempts to write the script with self-referential events, proving to everyone that the mysterious killer is actually sound engineer Max Applewhite. Max explains that his killings were a revenge scheme that dealt with stock holders and patents, specifically detailing his invention of television, which other scientists have copied. Roger and Penny are taken by Max atop the radio tower at gunpoint. Max is eventually killed when a biplane shows up <b>and</b> <b>guns</b> him down. Impressed by the nightly performance, the sponsors decide to fund WBN. Roger and Penny reconcile their complex relationship and decide not to divorce.|$|E
5|$|All these bands {{played a}} part in {{developing}} the overall look and sound of glam metal during the early 1980s. In 1985, many more commercially successful glam metal albums began to appear.

Los Angeles continued to foster the most important scene around the Sunset Strip, with groups like London, which had originally formed as a glam rock band in the 1970s, and had seen future members of Mötley Crüe, Cinderella <b>and</b> <b>Guns</b> N' Roses pass through its ranks, finally releasing their début album Non Stop Rock in 1985 as well.|$|E
