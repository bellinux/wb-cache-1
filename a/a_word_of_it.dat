500|$|Jim Reid's piece {{appeared}} in The Observer on 25 September 1994. This is [...] "one {{of the most}} peculiar stories of the year", he cautioned readers. [...] "Peculiar because pretty much everyone who comes across this magazine {{is going to have}} trouble believing <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Peculiar because every last dot and comma of what is to come is the truth." [...] "It took about two hours for that cash to go up in flames", he added. [...] "I looked at it closely, it was real. It came from a bona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey. More importantly, perhaps, after working with the K Foundation I know they are capable of this." ...|$|E
500|$|In the mailroom, Norville is {{assigned}} to deliver a [...] "Blue Letter" [...] to Mussburger; the letter is a top-secret communication from Hudsucker, sent shortly before his death. However, Norville takes the opportunity to pitch an invention he's been working on {{which turns out to}} be a simple drawing of a circle and his cryptic explanation, [...] "you know, for kids." [...] Believing Norville to be an idiot, Mussburger selects him as a proxy for Hudsucker. Across town, Amy Archer, a brassy Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the Manhattan Argus, {{is assigned}} to write a story about Norville and find out what kind of man he really is. She gets a job at Hudsucker Industries as his personal secretary, pretending to be yet another desperate graduate from Muncie. One night, Amy searches the building to find clues and meets Moses, a man who operates the tower's giant clock and knows [...] "just about anything if it concerns Hudsucker". He tells her Mussburger's plot, and she takes the story back to her Chief, but he does not believe <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|There was no {{nationwide}} {{election day}} in 1840, and many states, {{by the time}} they held the presidential vote, had already conducted balloting in local races and for the House of Representatives. One state, South Carolina, did not have a popular vote for president, with electors chosen by the legislature. These state and federal elections, from March to October 1840, led to Whig victories in all but a few states, mainly Democratic strongholds like New Hampshire. Among the victories was that of Whig Governor-elect Corwin in Ohio. The first presidential balloting began on October 29, in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and the polls ended with Rhode Island on November 23. Monday, November 2 was the largest polling day, as 12 states, including New York, voted. As those states compiled the vote, citizens scanned partisan and unreliable newspapers, trying to discern a trend. Even though Harrison led in 10 of the first 11 states to report, former president Jackson wrote to Van Buren, [...] "do not believe <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Nor will I believe that you are not elected until I see all the official returns." [...] But when the Whigs took New York by 13,000 votes, it was clear that Harrison and Tyler had won the election.|$|E

2500|$|Soon after Sheridan jumped {{his horse}} into the Confederate works, an orderly {{reported}} {{to him that}} Colonel Forsyth of his staff had been killed. Sheridan replied; [...] "It's no such thing. I don't believe <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> You'll find Forsyth's alright." [...] Ten minutes later, Forsyth rode up and Sheridan shouted: [...] "There! I told you so." [...] Sheridan ordered Ayres to halt and reform his division. When {{it was obvious that}} the Confederate line in fact had given way, Sheridan ordered Ayres to move forward.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{incredible}} really. In 1977, I flew over to England {{with the players}} {{and that was the}} flight on which Rodney Marsh broke the world beer drinking record. Three-quarters of the players on that flight had signed these sensational Packer contracts and they were all as drunk as you could imagine. But the secret still didn't get out. I sat beside Hookesy on the flight over and I had been best man at his wedding and not even he breathed <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to me... I went up and talked to Hookesy he said: [...] "Sorry mate, I didn't know whether you had signed or not." [...] Hookesy said he had wanted to tell me, but he just couldn't.|$|E
