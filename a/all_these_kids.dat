He hears the song, goes back there (in the studio) and starts programming. Within an hour, he had what I think is the coolest groove on the record. I knew we needed an organ part - <b>all</b> <b>these</b> grooves are programmed on keyboards. So I said, 'Moe, can you play the organ?' ...

[...] Columbia Records considered bringing in an outside producer for the album and had early talks with RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan.

I felt very much like an outsider. Even trying to talk about Hanukkah {{with some of them}} was like coming from an alien planet and talking about life there. The show is really about outsiders: Ryan was the most obvious outsider, as was Seth. The idea of a mixed half-Christian family in Newport would also contribute to the Cohen outsider-family status. That part of their identity was always very important. Seth coined a holiday that would both celebrate and underline his outsider status in Newport. That led us to Chrismukkah.|$|E

Formed in Hermosa Beach, California by guitarist and lyricist Greg Ginn, they played their first show in December 1977. Originally called Panic, they changed their name to Black Flag in 1978. Black Flag's sound mixed the raw simplicity of the Ramones with atonal guitar solos and frequent tempo shifts.|$|R
