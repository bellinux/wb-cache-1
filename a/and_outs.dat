25|$|Markov chain {{models have}} been used in {{advanced}} baseball analysis since 1960, although their use is still rare.

Each round lasts four minutes, <b>and</b> <b>outs</b> (misses, foul balls, etc.) do not count against players. All six sluggers participate {{in the first round}}.

The top two hitters after the second round advance to the final round. With home run totals reset, the player who hits the most homers in the final round is declared champion and is awarded a championship belt. Any ties are broken with 90-second tiebreaker rounds.|$|E
25|$|After the Aloha special, Parker made a {{deal that}} would later be used in court {{to prove that he}} had not acted in the best {{interests}} of Presley. He offered RCA the opportunity to buy Presley's entire back catalog for a mere $5.4 million. At the time, Presley's back catalog was not considered that important and RCA initially calculated it at being worth much less, but in later years it would become one of the most valuable catalogs in the music business. The sale of the catalog to RCA meant that after his death Presley's estate would not receive any royalties for his songs prior to 1973. To be fair to Parker, however, Presley had asked him to raise funds to pay for his upcoming divorce settlement. Presley, who was never one to know the full ins <b>and</b> <b>outs</b> of the music business, would have probably had no idea how important his back catalogue was, and therefore would have trusted Parker's judgment on the matter. Parker, too, could have never known how valuable the catalog would become.|$|E
25|$|Ohio State {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the second half, with the Wolverine defense forcing their first three {{and out of the}} game. Three runs for 58 yards by Mike Hart set up Michigan at the Ohio State 2. Hart scored his second touchdown of the day on a two-yard run, cutting the Buckeye lead again to one possession at 28–21. Three plays later, on Ohio State's next possession, Troy Smith threw an interception to Alan Branch, giving Michigan possession of the ball at the Buckeye 25 yard line. Michigan was unable to convert a first down off of the interception, settling instead for a 39-yard field goal from Garrett Rivas, cutting the Ohio State lead to 28–24. Ohio State responded three plays later on a 56-yard touchdown from Antonio Pittman, giving the Buckeyes a 35–24 lead. After driving to the Ohio State 34, Michigan was unable to convert on a fourth down, turning it over to Ohio State. Three <b>and</b> <b>outs</b> by both teams on their ensuing possessions, gave the ball back to Ohio State with over a minute remaining in the quarter. A fumble by Smith again gave the ball back to the Wolverines, this time at the Ohio State 9. A rush from no gain from Hart was the last play of the third quarter.|$|E

25|$|This {{game was}} part of a double header at the Garda RFC Westmanstown. The Vikings {{entering}} the game as huge underdogs {{for the first time in}} many years. Making matters worse the Vikings lost starting QB Marc Ashworth and Starting RB Ryan Meches to unforeseen circumstances leaving them with a 22-man squad facing the Champions. The game started positively for the Vikings on offence gathering some first downs and field position. The Defence which was the story of the day matched the champions in every aspect and looked a better outfit than the one that lost to Belfast in the Shamrock bowl the year before. As the first half came to a close the score was a measly 0–0 with both teams showing why they have been dominant in Irish football in recent years. The Vikings cam out in the second half hoping to get some movement on offence with their Defence continuing to be Dominant and impressive. The Vikings turned to players like ever present Kieran Coen to play both sides of the ball and he was the best player on the field on the day. With many other players such as Ian Cahill, Craig Switzer, Michael Guinane, Kieran Coen, Adrian Garvey and Sean Goldrick playing Offence, Defence and Special teams the game started to wear on the Vikings. 0-0 entering the 4th quarter in unprecedented 28 degree heat there was an air of inevitability about the game with the Vikings continually running 3 <b>and</b> <b>outs</b> on offence something had to give. With less than 10 minutes left and the Trojans creeping into Viking territory there was a sense that a big play needed to be made on Defence if they were going to have a shot of knocking off the Trojans. That chance came with a well read pass from the Trojans QB by Craig Switzer. The ball in his hands with 60 yards of clear field in front of the speedster nickel star of the Vikings and he took his eye off the ball and it fell on the turf. The crowd, the team and everyone else knew that was the chance and sure enough 3 plays later the Trojans constant Barrage finally broke the Vikings Defensive wall and ran in for a 20-yard score with 7 minutes left. The Trojans stopped the Vikings offense after some gutsy first downs by QB Paul Keane, RB/DL Ian Cahill and WR Sean Goldrick. The Trojans played the clock down to minutes left and with the game getting away from them the Vikings Defence gave up another score leaving it 14–0 final score.|$|E
