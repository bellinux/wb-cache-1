On 25 September 1944, the corps closed headquarters at Fort McPherson and moved to Hawaii. When it arrived in Hawaii, IX Corps was put {{under the command of}} the Tenth United States Army. Under the Tenth Army, IX Corps was assigned two missions. In 1944, it was primarily concerned with formulating plans for <b>an</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> the coastal regions of Japanese-held China.

5|$|During {{the truce}} of 1206–1208, John focused on {{building}} up his financial and military resources {{in preparation for}} another attempt to recapture Normandy. John used some of this {{money to pay for}} new alliances on Philip's eastern frontiers, where the growth in Capetian power was beginning to concern France's neighbours. By 1212 John had successfully concluded alliances with his nephew Otto IV, a contender for the crown of Holy Roman Emperor in Germany, {{as well as with the}} counts Renaud of Boulogne and Ferdinand of Flanders. The invasion plans for 1212 were postponed because of fresh English baronial unrest about service in Poitou. Philip seized the initiative in 1213, sending his elder son, Louis, to invade Flanders with the intention of next launching <b>an</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> England. John was forced to postpone his own invasion plans to counter this threat. He launched his new fleet to attack the French at the harbour of Damme. The attack was a success, destroying Philip's vessels and any chances of <b>an</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> England that year. John hoped to exploit this advantage by invading himself late in 1213, but baronial discontent again delayed his invasion plans until early 1214, in what was his final Continental campaign.|$|E
