5|$|A notable {{sub-type of}} coastal batik called Jawa Hokokai is not {{attributed}} to a particular region. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia in early 1940, the batik industry greatly declined due to material shortages.

Common motifs of Hokokai includes Japanese cherry blossoms, butterflies, and chrysanthemums.|$|E

5|$|Standard US {{tank and}} armored {{infantry}} battalions had a mortar platoon equipped with either M21s or the older M4 MMCs. The M21 was used mainly to illuminate targets {{at night or}} provide indirect fire support to the infantry.

5|$|A {{combination}} of favorable geographical features {{contributed to the}} success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E

Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to within striking distance of the fish.|$|E

5|$|Enterprising programmers were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> {{games for}} the ZX81 using nothing more than text {{characters}} and the machine's limited text semigraphics. Some ZX81 games achieved lasting fame, such as 3D Monster Maze, a tense first-person perspective game that involved the player escaping a labyrinth with a Tyrannosaurus rex in pursuit. Written in a combination of BASIC and machine code, its innovative design led it to be hailed as the first home computer 3D game and a landmark {{in the history of}} computer and video games.|$|E
5|$|Examination by {{a severe}} weather {{team from the}} Bureau of Meteorology {{examined}} the damage in the Bucca and Kolan region and recorded it as an 'F4' on the Fujita scale.

This is the first tornado ever to be recorded as an F4 in Australian history.|$|E

The soy {{stigmasterol}} was easily converted into commercial quantities of the female hormone progesterone, and the first pound of progesterone he made, valued at $63,500 ($ today), was shipped to the buyer, Upjohn, in an armored car. Production of other sex hormones soon followed.|$|E
5|$|Nonprofit {{organizations}} {{and government agencies}} have special requirements to show, in financial statements and reports, how money is spent, rather than how much profit was earned.
