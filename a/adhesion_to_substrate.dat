Despite the recent {{marketing}} of novel essential-oil-containing patches, there is no information on their production, constituents, or physical properties. The objectives {{of this study were}} to produce essential-oil patches and characterize their physical properties. The essential oil of Lavandula angustifolia (lavender) was included at concentrations of 2. 5 % to 10 % in patches manufactured from the exudate gum karaya, propylene glycol, glycerol, emulsifier, and optionally, potato starch as filler. Inclusion of essential oil reduced patch strength, stiffness, and elasticity relative to patches without essential oil. Inclusion of starch in the essential-oil patches strengthened them, but reduced their elasticity. Patches' <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>substrate</b> was examined by both peeling and probe-tack tests: the higher the inclusion of essential oils within the patch, the larger the decrease in its <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>substrate.</b> Addition of starch to essential-oil-containing patches increased their adhesion relative to their essential-oil-only counterparts. Scanning electron micrographs of the patches provided evidence of entrapped starch granules. Although inclusion of essential oil reduced both the mechanical properties and adhesion of the patches, a high proportion of essential oil can still be included without losing patch integrity or eliminating its adhesiveness to the skin...|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} {{does not}} provide a systematic analysis of the effect of electrostatic powder coating repainting of structural and constructional aluminum elements on their technological parameters. It is industrial practice that worn or damaged coatings be repainted. It is crucial to determine the effect of electrostatic sprayed coatings repainting on their microstructure, roughness and mechanical properties. The aim of the work is to determinate the influence of repainting of powder deposited polyester coatings on their mechanical properties, roughness and microstructure. This study examined three different electrostatic spray epoxy coatings with matt, silk gloss and fine structure-matt finish. Test panels were prepared as single- and double-layer paint coatings on the aluminum alloy 6060 substrate. Hence, six test sets of coatings were deposited. Each set contained six samples. The microstructure of the cross section of coating was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light optical microscopy (metallographic and stereoscopy microscope). The chemical composition of coating was analyzed by the SEM-EDS method. The 2 D surface roughness of single- and double-layer coatings and 3 D surface topography maps were examined using a profile measurement gauge. The mechanical properties of coatings were measured by cupping, bending, impact, <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>substrate</b> tests run according to standard procedures. As a result, the influence of repainting of polyester powder coatings on their properties was determined. The results demonstrate that repainting has no effect on the microstructure and coating <b>adhesion</b> <b>to</b> <b>substrate</b> as well as the bending test results and roughness of matt and silk gloss coatings.

A challenge in using electro-deposition for porous alumina is the potential sealing of the pores in aqueous solutions at higher temperatures.
