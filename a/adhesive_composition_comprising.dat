40|$|The BMSTU has solved a task of {{developing}} an original processing method to join cylindrical adhesive joints, which allows joining quality improvement. A key {{point of the}} method is that joining is vertically arranged and a forced air supply with a given amount of the airflow pressure and temperature is directed from the bottom end towards upper one. This method allows locking the <b>adhesive</b> <b>composition</b> in the gap and arrangement of conditions for curing an <b>adhesive</b> <b>composition</b> without its outflow. In this case {{it is possible to}} adjust mutual bracing of joining pieces to reach a specified joining accuracy till the cure of <b>adhesive</b> <b>composition.</b> To study a new method of joining, the BMSTU has built an experimental unit and carried out a set of experiments with an anaerobic <b>adhesive</b> <b>composition</b> Loctite 638 with varying the gap in the join within the range from 0. 1 to 0. 7 mm. In the course of experiments an empirical dependence of the critical shearing force on the gap value in the join has been derived, as well as the recommended conditions for air quality to hold the <b>adhesive</b> <b>compositions</b> depending on viscosity has been revealed. As a result of experimental research, it is found that for <b>adhesive</b> <b>composition</b> of low-viscosity from 20 to 1000 cSt, a range of air quality for holding the <b>adhesive</b> <b>composition</b> in the assembly gap is from 9. 8 to 196 Pa; for <b>adhesive</b> <b>composition</b> of middle-viscosity from 1000 to 2000 cSt, the recommended conditions lie in the range from 197 to 735. 5 Pa; for <b>adhesive</b> <b>composition</b> of high-viscosity from 2000 to 5000 cSt, the recommended assembly conditions are from 736 to 1471 Pa. The realized studies have shown that using a new joining method, the amount of used <b>adhesive</b> <b>composition</b> is by about 25 % less, the labor hours of the joining process are two times decreased, and the joining strength obtained is increased on average by 10 - 15 % as compared to the traditional assembly methods of the adhesive cylindrical joint.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} the effect of different f illers on the composition of urea-formaldehyde resins (UFR) was studied. The usage of fillers {{in the composition of}} urea-formaldehyde resins makes it possible to reduce the resin consumption by 10 – 20 %. Aluminum silicate type of fillers cannot be used conveniently in plywood technology because resin partic les initially agglomerate; then their swelling and hydration lead to the significant visc osity growth of the adhesive especially at a filler consumption rate more than 8 % by weight of the resin. Sulfate and carbonate types of fillers can be used more preferable because in this case there are no agglomeration of resin particles and no quick solidification of <b>adhesive</b> <b>composition.</b> Viscosity of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>composition</b> decreases vice-versa with th e adding of silicate type filler into the urea-formaldehyde resin. Combining of different fillers types allows controlling the rheological properties of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>composition.</b> Compounds containing ions of three-valence meta ls are effective catalysts of urea-formaldehyde resins. The usage of such catalysts in plywood technology leads to condensation time reduction of urea-formaldehyde resins at 1. 8 – 2. 3 times which opens up additional possibilities for application of low-emission resins with a low formaldehyde content.
