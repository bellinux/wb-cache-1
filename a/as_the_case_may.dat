40|$|Extract] It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that {{the sustainability of}} the global ecosystem in general, and of agriculture in particular, {{is dependent on the}} preservation, enhancement, and exploitation of biological diversity. Biological diversity - both wild and cultivated - underwrites the sustainability of agricultural production through the provision of the raw genetic material needed to drive innovation and adaptation, and through the provision of ecosystem processes and services that play important functional roles in agricultural systems. Agricultural biodiversity - or agrobiodiversity - plays a pivotal role in the livelihoods of all farmers regardless of resource endowment or geographical location. It provides the basic resources farmers need to adapt to varying conditions in marginal environments and the resources required to increase productivity in favourable areas. Clearly, there is a very close relationship between biodiversity and the livelihoods and well-being of agricultural communities. The need to protect and enhance agricultural biodiversity seems obvious. But what exactly does it meant to protect and enhance agricultural biodiversity? And how is this best achieved? As compelling <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for agrobiodiversity <b>may</b> appear, these seemingly simple and straightforward questions demand complex and wide-ranging answers...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{failures}} and severe corrosion distress of post-tensioned (PT) bridges in Florida have revealed corrosion of the 7 -wire strands in tendons. Post-tensioned duct assemblies are fitted with multiple 7 -wire steel strands and ducts are subsequently filled with grout. During construction, {{the length of}} time from the moment in which the strands have been inserted into the ducts, until the ducts are grouted, is referred to <b>as</b> <b>the</b> `ungrouted 2 ̆ 7 period. During this phase, the steel strands are vulnerable to corrosion and consequently the length of this period is restricted (typically to 7 days) by construction guidelines. This investigation focuses on determining the extent of corrosion that may take place during that period, but limited to strands that were in the unstressed condition. Visual inspections and tensile testing were used to identify trends in corrosion development. Corrosion induced cracking mechanisms were also investigated via wire bending and metallographic cross section evaluation. Corrosion damage on unstressed strands during ungrouted periods of durations in the order of those otherwise currently prescribed did not appear to seriously degrade mechanical performance as measured by standardized tests. However the presence of stress in <b>the</b> ungrouted period, <b>as</b> is normally <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> <b>may</b> activate other mechanisms (e. g., EAC) that require further investigation. As expected in the unstressed condition, no evidence of transverse cracking was observed...|$|R
40|$|Nation-building has {{historically}} and contemporaneously {{been a significant}} part of the foreign policy of the United States, and has been embraced by Republicans and Democrats alike at one point or another. It is therefore worth delving into this matter with a new frame of reference [...] i. e., that of liberty promotion [...] to determine whether this fundamental value has been furthered by the process of nation-building. Does nation-building promote liberty in the local nation, the intervening nation, both, or neither? This question, though seemingly fundamental, has not attracted the consideration it deserves, and warrants further investigation on both theoretical and empirical grounds. It is important to address whether nation-building may possibly promote liberty as well as whether it has yet done so. This is where the connection between theory and case studies comes into play. If indeed liberty is found to be promoted, or potentially promoted, in either or both nations, our very understanding of nation-building may undergo a fundamental change. A typical protestor who opposes the US 2 ̆ 7 s interventions abroad is likely to wield a sign or display a bumper sticker declaring 2 ̆ 2 No blood for oil, 2 ̆ 2 yet how many Americans would wave a banner that proclaimed 2 ̆ 2 No blood for liberty? 2 ̆ 2 Montesquieu and John Stuart Mill both exalted liberty <b>as</b> <b>the</b> highest form of human achievement, yet both also approved of colonization and suggested that so-called 2 ̆ 2 good despotism 2 ̆ 2 may offer the best means for ultimately attaining this liberty where it does not already exist. While Montesquieu proposed that commerce, with an appeal to human nature, provides the proper path to liberal colonization, Mill advocated for a foreign government comprised of experts who had the true interests of the colony and its people in mind. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> of US nation-building in Japan demonstrates that the promotion of liberty within the 2 ̆ 2 mother country 2 ̆ 2 as well <b>as</b> within <b>the</b> 2 ̆ 2 dependent country 2 ̆ 2 through the process of nation-building, when conducted properly, ispossible. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> of Iraq, conversely, demonstrates that success and liberty are far from guaranteed when nation-building is attempted. While a victory, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Japanese <b>case,</b> <b>may</b> offer a shining example of hope for future nation-building endeavors, <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Iraq ought to emphasize the weightiness of such a decision. The promotion of liberty, for both nations involved, should come more into play as leaders contemplate such drastic foreign policy measures as nation-building. Approaching nation-building from the standpoint of dual liberty-promotion will eliminate unnecessary recourse to doomed strategies and disingenuous or unrealistic goals...|$|R

Introduction This publication presents statistics about defendants dealt with by the criminal jurisdiction of the Higher (Supreme and Intermediate), Magistrates 2 ̆ 7 and Children 2 ̆ 7 s Courts of Australia, for the period 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013. Defendants include persons charged with criminal offences for each court level as well as organisations charged with criminal offences for the Higher and Magistrates 2 ̆ 7 Courts. The statistics are based on data extracted from administrative records held by state and territory agencies responsible for courts administration. The statistics have been compiled according to national standards and classifications. Courts data presented in this publication exclude cases such as bail reviews and applications to amend sentences or penalties which do not require the adjudication of charges. Also excluded are breaches of community based orders, appeal cases, tribunal matters and defendants for whom a bench warrant is issued but not executed. Policing and other law enforcement and regulatory agencies {{are responsible for the}} prevention, detection and investigation of crimes. When alleged offenders are detected by police, they can be proceeded against either {{through the use of a}} non-court action (such as a caution, fine or diversionary conference) or by charges being laid before a criminal court. When an offender appears before a court, they are referred to <b>as</b> <b>the</b> defendant.
