500|$|Heated discussions {{during the}} writing of Lions were rare, owing to the Robinson brothers' usual method in which Rich writes the music and Chris writes the lyrics. [...] "Soul Singing" [...] was the only song to cause disagreement; [...] "I'd written this part where {{although}} the vocals changed the music stayed the same throughout. [...] I thought we should add something or just not finish it, but Chris thought it was already a song, and a good one.

500|$|... "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter" [...] {{was filmed}} on February 8, 2010. In November 2009, it was {{announced}} that actress Julianne Moore would guest star on 30 Rock as a love interest for Alec Baldwin's character, Jack Donaghy. She made her debut as the character Nancy Donovan in the December 10, 2009, episode [...] "Secret Santa", and later guest starred in the episode [...] "Winter Madness". In December 2009, it was confirmed that actress Elizabeth Banks would guest star, and in the February 11, 2010, episode [...] "Anna Howard Shaw Day" [...] she made her debut as Avery Jessup, a CNBC correspondent. Banks later guest starred in the episode [...] "Future Husband". 30 Rock writer and producer Steve Hely appeared in this episode as a man who ignores Jenna Maroney. Keith Powell, who plays Toofer Spurlock, was asked about his reaction towards his storyline in the [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter" [...] script, in which he said [...] "They kind of warned me <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> – I thought it was a really fun thing because Affirmative Action has permeated corporate culture.

500|$|Prop master Rob Smith {{joined the}} series during its second season, {{and had to}} quickly learn about all the gadgets {{featured}} in Fringes debut season. Smith was asked to create a [...] "neural stimulator" [...] in the script to [...] "Momentum Deferred", but [...] "didn’t really know the episodes well enough to say, ‘Oh, ok, that’s exactly what it is.’ So I talked to the director, {{who had been on}} season 1, and he goes, ‘Oh, I don’t know, it’s just something that goes on the guy’s head'." [...] Smith discovered that the headpiece in question had been rented during the first season, causing him to recreate the prop over one weekend. He called this process [...] "a little bit stressful." [...] The gadget, Smith explained, was important because it [...] "defined the way that Walter works. He’s this mad scientist who takes conventional science and then puts his own twist on it, as it were. And then the thing that struck me <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> was that it made me uncomfortable to look at it." [...] Smith added, [...] "It’s {{one of those things that}} people love and hate about Fringe, it puts your [...] out of your comfort zone. That’s sort of what I was trying to say about Walter… there’s kind of a bird’s nest of wires everywhere, and then they end up on the guy’s head, and from that he can tell what the guy’s thinking. It’s quite cool." ...|$|E

There was a sting of frost in the air and a little snow beneath his feet, while his belt was girded about him tightly and his fingers stiffened on the rifle-barrel. Alton had eaten nothing since early morning, and very little then, while the fashion in which he stumbled through the thickets and amidst the fern conveyed a hint of exhaustion. It was, however, fortunate that a twig snapped noisily beneath him, because the deer are difficult to see in their sylvan home, and the sound was answered by a crackle that roused him to eager attention.|$|E
