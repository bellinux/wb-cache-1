5|$|The rider {{considered}} {{most likely}} to challenge Contador for the general classification was Richie Porte (Sky). Porte had already achieved nine race victories in 2015, including the overall victories in Paris–Nice, the Volta a Catalunya and the Giro del Trentino. Porte {{was expected to be}} particularly strong in the individual time trial, {{as well as in the}} mountains. Porte had not shown consistent form in a Grand Tour in recent years, however, and there were doubts <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> maintain his form over a three-week race.|$|E
5|$|For the 2009 remake, {{stuntman}} Derek Mears {{was hired}} to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of makeup special effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Mears's pleasant demeanor had the studio worried <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> portray such a menacing character on screen, but Mears assured them {{he would be able}} to perform the role. When Mears auditioned for the role he was asked why they should hire an actor over just another guy in a mask. As Mears explained, portraying Jason is similar to Greek mask work, where the mask and the actor are two separate entities, and, based on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance.|$|E
25|$|Carlos Peña {{fractured}} {{his left}} index finger on June 4, and {{was placed on the}} disabled list. He returned to the team on June 26, wearing a protective padding outside of his left batting glove to help ease impact. Rays manager Joe Maddon stated that once the Rays finished interleague play, and returned to playing American League teams, he would consider putting Pena in the Designated Hitter role to help ease the workload on his {{left index finger}}, as the Rays were more concerned <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> throw the ball, more than having to swing the bat.|$|E

He later confessed that he lied <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> get into the group, admitting he couldn’t actually play the organ at the time. While the band was in Munich, Davies met Dutch millionaire Stanley August Miesegaes, who offered to fund him if he started a new group.|$|R
5000|$|According to Keuzenkamp (1987) [...] "Karsten {{was fairly}} optimistic <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> make prognoses, but, {{as he had}} to admit , 'at the present time this {{investigation}} can not account for economic changes which are wholly due to the element of mob-, crowd- or herd-psychology'. In general, however, Karsten's conclusion is that these psychological factors are relatively unimportant, which leads him to find reason to state that his results support [...] "economic determinism". There is only one exception: the stock market. Of course {{it is not surprising that}} Karsten wasmoderate with claims about stock market prediction, so shortly after the generally unexpected crash of 1929." ...|$|R
25|$|Following {{criticism}} <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{spin the}} ball, Hauritz {{made the decision}} to move to New South Wales to play for the Blues, where he felt that he might have more opportunities to showcase his talents as a spinner on the traditionally spin-friendly Sydney Cricket Ground wicket. Nevertheless, opportunities at first class level remained elusive for Hauritz and in the 2006–07 Pura Cup season he played only three first class games, including the final against Tasmania, in which he played alongside his main rival Stuart MacGill and took 0/22 and 1/56 in a match that Tasmania won by 426 runs.|$|E
25|$|Rasputin's {{influence}} over the royal family was used against him and the Romanovs by politicians and journalists who wanted to weaken {{the integrity of the}} dynasty, force the Tsar to give up his absolute political power and separate the Russian Orthodox Church from the state. Rasputin unintentionally contributed to their propaganda by having public disputes with clergy members, bragging <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> influence both the Tsar and Tsarina, and also by his dissolute and very public lifestyle. Nobles in influential positions around the Tsar, as well as some parties of the Duma, clamored for Rasputin's removal from the court. Perhaps inadvertently, Rasputin had added to the Tsar's subjects' diminishing respect for him.|$|E
25|$|The trial against Bevan Spencer von Einem for {{the murder}} of Richard Kelvin opened at the Supreme Court Building of South Australia on 15 October 1984 before Mr. Justice White. A jury of 12 people (seven women and five men) were {{selected}} and were agreed upon by the prosecution and defence. Einem pleaded not guilty, and his defence was led by barrister Barry Jennings, who was assisted by Helena Jasinski, who had been Einem's solicitor {{from the start of the}} police investigation of him in the murder during the previous year. The prosecution was led by Brian Martin QC (later the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory), with assistance from Paul Rofe QC (who went on to be Director of the Department of Public Prosecutions). For the prosecution, it was a matter of proving Einem's guilt (along with that of unknown persons) by presenting the strong scientific evidence that had been gathered during the investigation, and disproving Einem's story of being in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. For the defence, it was a case of trying to make Einem's story hold up in court, and raising doubts <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> keep Richard Kelvin captive for five weeks and committing the murder.|$|E
5000|$|After his {{ordination}} he was {{tasked with}} teaching at a Dominican-run school in Bologna; {{at this point}} fellow priests - even the older ones - sought him out for spiritual direction and for confession. On an annual basis {{he would go to}} Fontanellato to hear the confessions of parishioners and in August 1903 obtained from Pope Pius X the elevation to the status of [...] "basilica" [...] of the Fontanellato Marian church. Lorgna was also the vice-curate of that shrine. In January 1905 he was appointed as the pastor of Ss. Giovanni e Paolo in Venice; he expressed doubts <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> look after the souls of the people and consulted with Ferrari who said: [...] "Go, my son, your fishery will be prodigious!"

500|$|During the 1992 presidential election, Bill Clinton used {{endorsements}} {{from the}} former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William J.

This became a feature of later presidential election campaigns. During the 2004 presidential election, twelve retired generals and admirals endorsed Senator John Kerry, including former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William Crowe, and the former Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Merrill [...] "Tony" [...] McPeak, who also appeared in television advertisements defending Kerry against the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.

500|$|Unsettled in Italy, Henry {{transferred}} from Juventus on 3 August 1999 to Arsenal {{for an estimated}} fee of £11million, reuniting with his former manager Arsène Wenger. It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer, and although his transfer was not without controversy, Wenger was convinced he was worth the transfer fee. Brought in {{as a replacement for}} fellow French forward Nicolas Anelka, Henry was immediately moulded into a striker by Wenger, a move that would pay rich dividends in years to come. However, doubts were raised <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> adapt to the quick and physical English game when he failed to score in his first eight games. After several difficult months in England, Henry even conceded that he had to [...] "be re-taught everything about the art of striking." [...] These doubts were dispelled when he ended his first season at Arsenal with an impressive goal tally of 26. Arsenal finished second in the Premier League behind Manchester United, and lost in the UEFA Cup Final against Turkish club Galatasaray.|$|E
500|$|The main {{theme of}} Xander's dream is {{his sense of}} failure and of being left behind as his friends move ahead in life. His fear that he is stuck is reiterated {{throughout}} his dream by his inability to escape his basement bedroom in his parents' home. No matter where his dream takes him, he ends up back in the basement. As {{the only one of}} the Scoobies not in college, he feels anxiety <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> understand and keep up with ideas and conversations, a fear which is realized when he goes to the university, a place he already feels excluded from, and finds that he cannot understand what people say to him. Aware that he is being chased and is in danger, he asks Giles what is happening but cannot understand his answer, nor what Anya says to him, as they are both inexplicably speaking French. He exclaims, [...] "I don't understand!" [...] During his dream both Buffy and Willow tell him, [...] "I'm way ahead of you," [...] and Giles tells him [...] "the others have gone on ahead," [...] underscoring his fear that this is really the case.|$|E
500|$|Remaining healthy {{throughout}} the season, Richard appeared in 46 of Montreal's 50 games. [...] He led the Canadiens with 32 goals and tallied 54 points, third-best in his team. Richard's season not only ended the criticism <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{play in the}} league, but established {{him as one of}} the best young players in the NHL. Coach Dick Irvin shifted Richard from the left wing to right and placed him on a forward line with Toe Blake and Elmer Lach. The trio, known as the [...] "Punch line", formed a dominant scoring unit {{throughout the}} 1940s. The Canadiens lost only six games after October, and went on to win the franchise's first Stanley Cup championship in 13 years. Richard led the league with 12 playoff goals, including a five-goal effort against the Toronto Maple Leafs in a semi-final game. [...] He tied Newsy Lalonde's NHL record for goals in one playoff game (equalled by three players since), which resulted in his being named first, second and third star of the game. Richard was named a second team All-Star following the season. It was the first of 14 consecutive years he was named a league all-star.|$|E
500|$|When {{depicting}} {{life in the}} projects, Nas alternates from {{moments of}} pain and pleasure to frustration and braggadocio. The columnist for OhWord.com wrote: [...] " [...] narrative voice swerves between personas that are cynical and optimistic, naïve and world-weary, enraged and serene, globally conscious and provincial". Music writer Jeff Weiss of Pitchfork describes the [...] "enduring image" [...] often associated with Nas's narrated stream of consciousness: [...] " [...] baby-faced Buddha monk in public housing, scribbling lotto dreams and grim reaper nightmares in dollar notebooks, words enjambed in the margins. The only light is the orange glow of a blunt, bodega liquor, and the adolescent rush of first creation. Sometimes his pen taps the paper and his brain blanks. In the next sentence, he remembers dark streets and the noose." [...] Critic and blogger Kenny Waste comments on the significance of Queensbridge as a setting in Illmatic, writing, “The songs are made up largely of recollections or Nas describing his emotions, which range from feeling trapped <b>to</b> overt optimism <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> escape the 'hands of doom'.

500|$|Burwell and Fleming say the book's subtext {{is about}} aging, as {{symbolized by the}} writer's {{attraction}} to the younger fertile woman, and Hemingway used fertility imagery to symbolize [...] "the aging writer's anxiety <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> write". [...] The images of the old elephant symbolize the aging and unproductive writer, and Burwell approves Patrick Hemingway's decision to retain those pieces of the manuscript. Hemingway scholar Hilary Justice writes the work shows an emphasis on [...] "the writer not writing", [...] which for Hemingway {{would have been a}} fate worse than aging. Thus, she says, True at First Light invokes a paradox with [...] "an aging writer for whom writing is becoming increasingly difficult in the moment of writing about the not-writing author". Writing, for Hemingway, had always been difficult. He revised his work endlessly and stuck to the practice of writing [...] "one true sentence" [...] and stopping each writing session when he still had more to write. Tom Jenks, editor of an earlier posthumously published book The Garden of Eden, says Hemingway shows the worst of his writing in True at First Light: presenting himself as a [...] "self-pitying, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing" [...] persona in a book that {{is no more than a}} mass of fragmentary material. Jenks thinks Hemingway is simply aimlessly writing and the plot lacks the tension notable in his earliest works such as The Sun Also Rises. However, he thinks Hemingway had good material to work with and some skeletal thematic structures show promise.|$|E
500|$|In 1914, Jardine entered Winchester College. At the time, life at Winchester was arduous and austere; {{discipline}} was harsh. Sport {{and exercise}} were vital {{parts of the}} school day. In Jardine's time, preparing the pupils for war was also important. According to Jardine's biographer, Christopher Douglas, the pupils were [...] "taught to be honest, impervious to physical pain, uncomplaining and civilised." [...] All pupils were required to be academically competent and Jardine {{was able to get}} along without exhibiting brilliance; successful sportsmen, on the other hand, were revered. Jardine enjoyed a slightly better position than some pupils, already possessing a reputation as a cricketer and excelling at other sports; he represented the school at football as a goalkeeper and rackets, and played Winchester College football. But it was at cricket that he excelled. He was in the first eleven for three years from 1917 and received coaching from Harry Altham, Rockley Wilson and Schofield Haigh, the latter two of whom were distinguished cricketers. In 1919, his final year, Jardine came top of the school batting averages with 997 runs at an average of 66.46. He also became captain despite some doubts within the school <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> unify the team. Under Jardine, Winchester won their annual match against Eton College in 1919, a fixture in which Eton usually held the upper hand. Jardine's batting (35 and 89 in the match) and captaincy were key factors in his side's first victory over Eton for 12 years. After his retirement from cricket, he named his 89 in that match as his favourite innings. Jardine went on to score 135 not out against Harrow School.|$|E
