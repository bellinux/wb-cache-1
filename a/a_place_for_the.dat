The Club Hiparión is internationally known for its equestrian training.|$|E
5|$|The yucca, Yucca whipplei, is pollinated {{exclusively}} by Tegeticula maculata, a yucca moth {{that depends on}} the yucca for survival. The moth eats the seeds of the plant, while gathering pollen. The pollen has evolved to become very sticky, and remains on the mouth parts when the moth moves to the next flower. The yucca provides <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> moth to lay its eggs, deep within the flower away from potential predators.|$|E
5|$|With {{the trilogy}} complete, Puccini {{had to decide}} on <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> premiere. In 1918, travel was risky and uncertain. Puccini {{received}} an offer from Buenos Aires which he refused, unwilling to have so complex a work first performed overseas in his absence. He finally agreed that the premiere could {{take place at the}} Metropolitan Opera in New York, without his being there, on the basis of performing instructions which he supplied to the conductor. Gianni Schicchi proved to be the last opera completed by Puccini.|$|E

In their first competition together at the Trofeo Princesa Sofia, they finished in ninth place and secured a place on the Israeli sailing team for the Games. This was the second time Cohen represented Israel at the Olympics. The two teams failed to qualify for the finals. Amir and Cohen finished seventeenth with 120 net points. Froyliche and Levin finished twenty-first with 152 net points.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} nineteenth century Tunbridge Wells {{experienced}} growth as <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> well-to-do to visit and make their homes. It became a fashionable resort town again following visits by the Duchess of Kent, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and benefited from a new estate on Mount Pleasant and the building of the Trinity church in 1827, and improvements made to the town and the provision of facilities such as gas lighting and a police service meant that by 1837 the town population had swelled to 9,100. In 1842 an omnibus service was set up that ran from Tonbridge to Tunbridge Wells, enabling visitors to arrive from London within two hours, and in 1845 the town was linked to the railway network via a branch from South Eastern Railway's London-Hastings Hastings Line at Tonbridge. During this time Decimus Burton developed John Ward's Calverley Park estate.|$|E
5|$|Some of Belton's many {{rooms have}} been altered {{over the last}} 300 years both in use and design. One of the {{principal}} rooms, the Marble Hall (1), {{the first of the}} large reception rooms, serves as an entrance hall from the south entrance, and takes its name from a chequer board patterned floor of black and white marble tiles. By the time of Belton's conception, the great hall was no longer <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> household to eat, but intended as a grand entrance to the house. The hall was originally hung with 28 portraits of Kings, Queens, and Emperors, from William the Conqueror to William III, intended to give the house an air of dynastic importance. The less numerous and far newer Brownlow family portraits were originally hung in the Great Dining Room immediately above. The room is fully panelled, and parts of the panelling contain lime wood embellishments attributed to Grinling Gibbons. In the early 19th century, this room, and some others, were re-modelled by Jeffry Wyatville, who in addition to graining and painting the panelling to imitate oak installed new doors.|$|E

5|$|The Dresden meeting {{revealed}} that Austria's influence in Europe had reached its lowest point, and Metternich was now bent on re-establishing that influence by using {{what he considered}} strong ties with all sides in the war, proposing general peace talks headed by Austria. Over the next three months, he would slowly distance Austria from the French cause, while avoiding alliance with either Prussia or Russia, and remaining open to any proposal that would secure <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> combined Bonaparte-Habsburg dynasty. This was driven by concern that if Napoleon were defeated, Russia and Prussia would stand to gain too much. Napoleon was intransigent, however, and the fighting (now officially the War of the Sixth Coalition) continued. Austria's alliance with France ended in February 1813, and Austria then moved {{to a position of}} armed neutrality.|$|E
5|$|The winning candidate, Charles McDonald, did {{not hold}} the seat long, resigning it to open <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, who had been {{defeated}} in his Ontario riding. The Tories ran no candidate against Mackenzie King in the by-election on February 15, 1926, and he won easily. Although in the 1925 federal election, the Conservatives had won {{the greatest number of}} seats, Mackenzie King continued as Prime Minister with the tacit support of the Progressives. Mackenzie King held office for several months until he finally resigned when the Governor General, Lord Byng, refused a dissolution. Conservative Party leader Arthur Meighen became Prime Minister, but was quickly defeated in the House of Commons, and Byng finally granted a dissolution of Parliament. Diefenbaker, who had been confirmed as Conservative candidate, stood against Mackenzie King in the 1926 election, a rare direct electoral contest between two Canadian Prime Ministers. Mackenzie King triumphed easily, and regained his position as Prime Minister.|$|E

25|$|There is {{debate between}} {{scholars}} {{as to why}} these institutions were started by the church.

25|$|Donizetti {{was born}} in Bergamo in Lombardy. Although he {{did not come from}} a musical background, at an early age he was taken under the wing of {{composer}} Simon Mayr who had enrolled him by means of a full scholarship in a school which he had set up.

Mayr was also instrumental in obtaining <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> young man at the Bologna Academy, where, at the age of 19, he wrote his first one-act opera, the comedy Il Pigmalione, which may not have ever been performed during his lifetime.|$|E

Paine then bargained with the First Presbyterian church to use their parking lot. In the mounting tension the church elders refused to allow the band to use the church facilities when the local paper ran a photo of the Mind Garage in a tree with Paine and friends standing about.

The second test of this series ended with {{a victory for the}} England team winning 3822, thanks in no small part to a hat-trick of tries from Ainscough, and another from Richard Myler, who would also go on to prominence in Super League with fellow Lancastrians, Salford.|$|E
