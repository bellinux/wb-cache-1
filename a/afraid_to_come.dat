5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out and be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E
25|$|South Korea's still {{continuing}} traditionalist beliefs {{result in}} few people being open about their homosexuality. Homosexuality is discouraged, although homosexuality is legal in South Korea. As a result, {{there are few}} if any legal protections in place for gays and lesbians, {{and many of them}} are <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out to their families, friends, and co-workers. Gay men are not allowed to serve in the military, and in 2005 five soldiers were discharged for homosexuality.|$|E

2500|$|Ferguson {{originally}} {{sought to}} question {{himself on the}} witness stand, but ultimately did not do so. He told the judge and media outlets he intended to call a number of witnesses that would prove his innocence, including a ballistic expert, a handwriting expert and two regular eyewitnesses, but that they were <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> forward and take the stand. Ultimately, he did not call any of the witnesses. He also told Judge Belfi of an alleged conspiracy by the Jewish Defense League to kill him in prison if he was convicted. He said the prison slaying of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer was [...] "set up as a prelude against me".|$|E

Adding that they hoped the move would [...] "tempt witnesses from the so-called 'Bebo generation'" [...] to become involved in the inquiry, they noted that [...] "dozens of people have flooded Zoe's page on the social networking site with tributes" [...] and officers were [...] "desperate to tap into their local knowledge". D/Supt Robertson said: [...] "The response so far has been slower than we would have liked... We hope that by offering new ways to contact the investigation team more people will come forward." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Daughters of Bilitis , {{also called}} the DOB or the Daughters, was the first lesbian civil and {{political}} rights organization in the United States. The organization, formed in San Francisco in 1955, was conceived as a social alternative to lesbian bars, which were subject to raids and police harassment. As the DOB gained members, their focus shifted to providing support to women who were <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out. The DOB educated them about their rights, and about gay history. The historian Lillian Faderman declared, [...] "Its very establishment in the midst of witch-hunts and police harassment was an act of courage, since members always had to fear that they were under attack, not because of what they did, but merely because of who they were." [...] The Daughters of Bilitis endured for 14 years, becoming an educational resource for lesbians, gay men, researchers and mental health professionals.|$|E

Guards were on duty four days a week, but no longer personally escorted volunteers. On April 23, 2013, Mora asked supporters on Facebook to petition the police for more help. [...] "Send messages to the police so they <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Moín Beach", he wrote. [...] "Tell them not <b>to</b> be <b>afraid</b> but <b>to</b> <b>come</b> armed ... we need help and fast." [...] On April 28, Mora told La Nación that environmentalists were being threatened [...] "by a mafia that was looting the nests for eggs".

She proposes to open a store and sell liquor and cigars, which she serves herself, in the broken-down tienda which was {{regularly}} given to her people by the Spanish grantee of the land we're squatting on. It's not her fault but ours if we've adopted a line of rules, which don't agree with hers, to govern the settlers on HER land, nor should she be compelled to follow them. Nor because we justify OUR squatting here, on the ground that the Spanish grant isn't confirmed yet, can we forbid her squatting under the same right." ...|$|R

60|$|This, of course, was {{perfectly}} correct. Ever {{since the day}} when Mr. Pupkin met Zena in the Main Street he used <b>to</b> <b>come</b> past the house on his bicycle just after bank hours. He would have gone past twenty times a day but he was <b>afraid</b> <b>to.</b> As he <b>came</b> up Oneida Street, he used to pedal faster and faster,--he never meant to, but he couldn't help it,--till he went past the piazza where Zena was sitting at an awful speed with his little yellow blazer flying in the wind. In a second he had disappeared in a buzz and a cloud of dust, and the momentum of it carried him clear out into the country for miles and miles before he ever dared to pause or look back.|$|R
50|$|Jonas and Emma go {{to school}} the next day, but Sofie feigns illness so she can stay home and explore some more. She succeeds in tricking Tove, who allows her to stay home. Then, Sofie {{goes back to the}} dolmen she found and crawls in. Inside, she sees a large stone snake decorating the wall, {{and in the middle of}} the cavern, she sees a man with long hair and beard chained (by both of his arms and by his neck), on his knees, and {{apparently}} sleeping (his eyes are closed and he is snoring). When Sofie tries to move the man's hair so she can see his face, he wakes up, and is surprised to see a person. He introduces himself as the Norse god Loki, and implores Sofie to unchain him. Sofie is frightened and runs back home, while Loki calls after her <b>to</b> not be <b>afraid</b> and <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back.|$|R

50|$|At first MacDonald {{was able}} {{to make the most of}} this disorder, and he was about to order the last fortifications {{destroyed}} when Mack, <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> lose Capua, <b>came</b> up with a ruse: he asked MacDonald for a cease-fire for the safe passage of the Cisalpine Republic ambassador, returning to Milan from Naples. The French general reluctantly agreed to this demand and the enemy general used the time to rally his troops and reorganize them to his advantage. After the ambassador left, the battle began anew. The San-Antonio redoubt and all of its fortifications fell, but the artillery assault from the walls, which the French were ill-equipped to answer, was so deadly and constant that MacDonald was forced to pull back. Meanwhile, General Maurice Mathieu's arm was shattered by grapeshot. MacDonald took the captured Neapolitan artillery with him while returning to the morning's positions. He had lost about 300 men that day.|$|R
