25|$|In any case, an {{efficient}} surveillance {{is essential to}} monitor the presence of tiger mosquitoes {{and the effect of}} control programs. Ovitraps are normally used for the monitoring of Ae. albopictus. They are black water containers with floating Styrofoam blocks or small wooden paddles that are in contact with the surface of the water. Female tiger mosquitoes lay their eggs on these surfaces. Through the identification of these eggs or of the larvae that hatch from these eggs in the laboratory, the presence and abundance of mosquito species can be estimated. Versions of these traps with an <b>adhesive</b> <b>film</b> (sticky traps) that catch the egg-depositing mosquitoes make the analysis much easier and quicker, but are more complicated in terms of handling. The results of ovitraps are often variable and depend on the availability of alternative egg-depositing waters. Due to this, it is best to use them in large numbers and in conjunction with other monitoring methods.|$|E

40|$|Morphological {{intricacies of}} the {{biological}} attachment pads generate considerable interest owing to their remarkable ability to control adhesion to various surfaces. Motivated by the adhesive microstructures of insects, we examine the behaviour of adhesion and crack propagation in patterned <b>adhesive</b> <b>films.</b> These films are made of silicone elastomers that were patterned with lateral, longitudinal or crosswise incisions from which a thin silanized glass plate was removed in a displacement-controlled peel experiment. The behaviours of crack propagation on these patterned <b>adhesive</b> <b>films</b> are controlled by simple incision patterns, their depths and spacing. With the crosswise incisions, significant enhancement (× 10 – 20) of fracture energy has been achieved. These findings point towards an important mechanism by which of biological organisms might enhance adhesion, and provide a simple design principle for manipulating the interfacial fracture {{in a variety of}} artificial attachment devices...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by the {{observation}} that many naturally occurring adhesives arise as textured thin films, we consider the displacement controlled peeling of a flexible plate from an incision-patterned thin adhesive elastic layer. We find that crack initiation from an incision on the film occurs at a load much higher than that required to propagate it on a smooth adhesive surface; multiple incisions thus cause the crack to propagate intermittently. Microscopically, this mode of crack initiation and propagation in geometrically confined thin <b>adhesive</b> <b>films</b> {{is related to the}} nucleation of cavitation bubbles behind the incision which must grow and coalesce before a viable crack propagates. Our theoretical analysis allows us to rationalize these experimental observations qualitatively and quantitatively and suggests a simple design criterion for increasing the interfacial fracture toughness of <b>adhesive</b> <b>films.</b> Comment: 8 pages, To appear in Proceedings of Royal Society London, Ser. ...|$|R

40|$|As {{electronic}} and optical components reach the micro- and nanoscales, efficient assembly and packaging {{require the use}} of adhesive bonds. This work focuses on resolving several fundamental issues in the transition from macro- to micro- to nanobonding.

While researchers have studied dewetting dynamics of thin films of model, non-polar polymers, little experimental work has been done regarding dewetting dynamics of thin <b>adhesive</b> <b>films,</b> which exhibit much more complex behaviors.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{polymerization}} kinetics of different <b>adhesive</b> <b>films</b> in relation to their permeability after exposure to different LED curing units. METHODS: One adhesive from each class was analyzed: a three-step etch-and-rinse (OptiBond FL; Sybron-Kerr), a two-step etch-and-rinse (One-Step, Bisco), a two-step self-etch (Clearfil Protect Bond, Kuraray) and a one-step self-etch adhesive (Xeno III; Dentsply DeTrey). <b>Adhesive</b> <b>films</b> were prepared and cured with SmartLite IQ (Dentsply) or L. E. Demetron I (Demetron Kerr) up to complete curing. Polymerization kinetic curves of the tested adhesives were obtained with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In particular, total reaction time and extent of polymerization (Ep) at 20, 40 or 60 s were compared. Permeability of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>films</b> was evaluated on flat dentin surfaces of human extracted teeth connected to a permeability device and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Total reaction time differed among the adhesives tested: OptiBond FL<Clearfil Protect Bond<One-Step<Xeno III with both curing units (p< 0. 05). At 20 s OptiBond FL showed the highest Ep, while the lowest values were obtained with One-Step and Xeno III (p< 0. 05). E(p) increased when curing time was prolonged (40 and 60 s) for all adhesives tested (p< 0. 05), however, on simplified adhesives, incomplete polymerization took place even after prolonged exposure intervals.

50|$|A third {{method of}} {{constructing}} composite materials {{is known as}} a dry layup.

Pinhole elimination with minimal resin amounts generally require the use of autoclave pressures to purge the residual gases out.|$|E
