That has been a very great improvement. The wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did, so long! You will tell Sir Walter what we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had. Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say, that the few alterations we have made have been <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the better. My wife should have the credit of them, however. I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father's.

In the discussion section of our paper, 1 we hypothesized that one of the explanations for the worse outcome for the “older ” adolescent (18 - 20 years old) who comprised the majority of patients on the CALGB trials, but the minority of the patients in the 16 - to 20 -year-old age group treated on CCG trials was their “emancipated ” status—that is, that they may no longer have been tightly linked to parental supervision and support and, consequently, may have been less compliant with the follow-up visits and adherence to their outpatient medications that are so critical to the successfu...|$|R

And, I'm glad the disk jockeys have done their part in keeping you informed, and that's what RNI plans to do[...] [...] I'm out here {{right now with the}} owner of Radio North Sea International, from Mebo AG in Zurich, Switzerland and we hope we don't have too many problems. At the moment, the ships have pulled off. But we are sure, as they have told us, that they are coming back. They had brought a child, and a woman, on one of their ships, to kinda deter us from doing anything to them. Although it is our intention[...] [...] defend ourselves. As the owner of the station has said to the Captain of the trip that brought us out here, only the agent from the shipping company in Holland, myself, and the owner Mr Erwin Meister has come out to the Mebo. Many people wanted to come out to help us. We told them they could not come on our ship, we are not interested in any fights, we are not interested in any deaths at sea. This station is not around to make trouble, this station is around to provide you with musical entertainment. This is the reason that we asked that only the shipping agent, Mr Erwin Meister, and myself, Larry Tremaine, to come out here to the Mebo II to see what the problem was. We have contacted our attorneys, our solicitors in Holland, and {{we are trying to do}} our utmost to do the best for you. So please stay tuned. Thank you <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> lighting up the switchboard at the Grand Hotel. We appreciate that very much. Also thank you very much for lighting up the switchboard in Zurich. As I understand, all the lines were flooded, showing your continued support for Radio North Sea International. We are not saying that at this time, that we do not still need help, because at this time they have pulled away. But we are sure that they are coming back. Mr Manders has no right to take this ship. There has never been a contract signed with him. There are no agreements between him and Radio North sea International. This I can assure our listeners implicitly, there is no agreement, and there is no reason for this action whatsoever. We are {{very sorry for}} all this trouble, we are very sorry to interrupt music like this. But you can understand our involved situation out here. We will protect the Mebo II to the utmost. We will not leave this ship, we are prepared for them although we do not want a fight. We do not want any deaths, or anybody hurt at all. It went so far as to tell them, when they planned to put water on the transmitter, the disk jockeys, just by thinking of the people on the ship, and not thinking of themselves, told them not to put water on the transmitter, because it would kill everybody on the tug boat. This we did not have to do, but we did it because we are a music station. We are not around to injure or endanger any lives whatsoever. So please stay tuned, if you wish to help, we want it. But meanwhile, stay with us." ...|$|E

60|$|On {{reaching}} {{the end of}} the southern island, called Uta, we were kept waiting two days for a wind that would enable us to pass over to the next island, Teor, and I began to despair of ever reaching Ke, and determined on returning. We left with a south wind, which suddenly changed to north-east, and induced me to turn again southward in the hopes that this was the commencement of a few days' favourable weather. We sailed on very well in the direction of Teor for about an hour, after which the wind shifted to WSW., and we were driven much out of our course, and at nightfall found ourselves in the open sea, and full ten miles to leeward of our destination. My men were now <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> frightened, <b>for</b> if we went on we might be a. week at sea in our little open boat, laden almost to the water's edge; or we might drift on to the coast of New Guinea, in which case we should most likely all be murdered. I could not deny these probabilities, and although I showed them that we could not get back to our starting-point with the wind as it was, they insisted upon returning. We accordingly put about, and found that we could lay no nearer to Uta than to Teor; however, by great good luck, about ten o'clock we hit upon a little coral island, and lay under its lee till morning, when a favourable change of wind brought us back to Uta, and by evening (April 18th) we reached our first anchorage in Matabello, where I resolved to stay a few days, and then return to Goram. It way with much regret that I gave up my trip to Ke and the intervening islands, which I had looked forward to as likely to make up for my disappointment in Ceram, since my short visit on my voyage to Aru had produced me so many rare and beautiful insects.|$|R

Thank {{you very}} much for the swell gift package that you sent me. I {{received}} it a few days ago and it arrived in excellent condition. My buddies and I certainly enjoyed the delicious cookies, candies, etc. but my greatest enjoyment came in receiving the package. It showed me that the students at Bryant were earnestly keeping their fellow students in the Service in mind. We 2 ̆ 7 ve been real busy here lately, so busy, in fact, that we haven 2 ̆ 7 t even had much time to think back to our civilian days. And when I received your package, it brought back fond memories of the days when I was {{an active member of the}} B. S. C., and the way we used to work to get packages out to the service men, and to sell war stamps and bonds. I 2 ̆ 7 m more glad now than ever that I did my part then, because now I know how happy a Service man feels when he receives something from his alma mater. I am in my 50 th day of basic military training today and I have about 6 more days of basic to go. It may interest you to know that I have been accepted for Aviation Cadet Training and that I will be at it very shortly. I 2 ̆ 7 d like to write more but my writing time is limited.

40|$|Transcription begins] U. S. S. WEEHAWKEN % postmaster, N. Y. February 16, 1943 Bryant Servicemens’ Club Bryant College Providence, R. I. To all concerned: Thank you <b>all</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the box {{of candy}} sent to me for Christmas. At Christmas time, I {{was out in the}} war zone, many miles away from the states. I came back to the states on February 7 th, and on February 8 th, we, the crew, {{received}} our first mail in many months. I was indeed surprised to receive the package from the Bryant Servicemens’ Club. It was in very good condition and I, together with my shipmates, enjoyed our Hallowe’en [sic], Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years on the day of our arrival in the states. I’m a yeoman second class, aboard one of the Navy’s largest minelayers. The duty aboard this type of ship is very dangerous, especially when one considers the fact that we carry tons of TNT. One hit by and enemy ship on almost any part of our ship will blow us to bits. I was in Africa, at Casablanca, where I saw service and action. We mined the coast of certain places, places which I cannot mention. Also was in the Mediterranean, Gibralter [sic] and other places. Casablanca, I would say, is a fair city. It has some beautiful buildings and parks. The fig, orange, and tangerine trees add greatly to the beauty of this place. Besides the French; Italians and Spanish live here. There are many tribes of Arabs and Moslems here. They just loiter on the streets in groups selling their wares. They are very dangerous at times and have to be dealt with. We had air-raids here, one of which occurred on or about Christmas Eve. This one lasted about five hours. The flashes of the guns and the wakes of the tracers in the sky lit up the night like a Christmas tree. The sun rises about 8 : 30 a. m., which made the days very short. Gibralter [sic] is a nice place and will be very difficult to the Axis to overpower. Can’t say much about this place. Well, I guess I’ll stop for now for I’ll be here all day just writing. Again, let me thank all of you who made it possible for me and also others in the same position, to receive this gift. I appreciate it very much and will remember it always. You know when a sailor is on watch out at sea, he had plenty to think about and you know the way it is, one’s mind just begins to wander on and on and knowing that someone thought of him makes him feel very happy and thankful. During action my battle station is in the Fire Control. This is the place from which the range and angles and scales are given to the gunners and also the word to fire. Thank you all very much I’ll write you again and will try to drop in when I get some leave. Sincerely S. Benjamin Spinella Y 2 /c [Transcription ends...|$|E
