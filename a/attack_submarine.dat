It was {{the first}} ship of the , which {{was the first}} {{operational}} submarine class in the world to use air-independent propulsion in the form of Stirling engines which use liquid oxygen and diesel as the propellant.|$|E
25|$|The R-class {{submarines}} were a {{class of}} 12 small British diesel-electric submarines built for the Royal Navy during World War I, and were forerunners of the modern <b>attack</b> <b>submarine,</b> in that they were designed specifically to attack and sink enemy submarines, their battery capacity and hull shape being optimized for underwater performance.|$|E
50|$|In March 1943, she was escorting Convoys HX.229A from St. John's to Great Britain {{when the}} convoy came under heavy and {{sustained}} attacks from two German U-boat groups totalling 29 <b>attack</b> <b>submarines.</b> Subsequently, she also escorted Convoy ONS3 and Convoy SC128 whilst {{they were being}} attacked by groups of German <b>attack</b> <b>submarines.</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} major types of {{submarines}} in the United States Navy: ballistic missile <b>submarines,</b> <b>attack</b> <b>submarines,</b> and cruise missile submarines. All submarines in the U.S. Navy are nuclear-powered. Ballistic subs {{have a single}} strategic mission of carrying nuclear submarine-launched ballistic missiles. <b>Attack</b> <b>submarines</b> have several tactical missions, including sinking ships and subs, launching cruise missiles, and gathering intelligence.|$|R
25|$|HMS Astute is an {{operational}} nuclear-powered submarine in the Royal Navy, the lead ship of her class. Astute {{is the second}} submarine of the Royal Navy to be named after the characteristic of shrewdness and discernment—the first was the World War II-era Amphion-class Astute. She was the largest <b>attack</b> <b>submarine</b> in Royal Navy history when commissioned.|$|E
25|$|The Type 209 is a {{class of}} {{diesel-electric}} <b>attack</b> <b>submarine</b> developed exclusively for export by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft of Germany. The original variant (Type 209/1100) was designed in the late 1960s. Despite not being operated by the German Navy, five variants of the class (209/1100, 209/1200, 209/1300, 209/1400 and 209/1500) have been successfully exported to 13 countries, with 61 submarines being built and commissioned between 1971 and 2008.|$|E
25|$|As of March 2017, 67,109 {{personnel}} are in service with the Indian Navy, of which 10,279 are officers. , the operational fleet consists of one aircraft carrier, one amphibious transport dock, eight landing ship tanks, 11 destroyers, 14 frigates, one nuclear-powered <b>attack</b> <b>submarine,</b> one ballistic missile submarine, 13 conventionally-powered attack submarines, 24 corvettes, four mine countermeasure vessels, four fleet tankers {{and various other}} auxiliary vessels.|$|E

25|$|Several ships {{have been}} named after the state. Most famous is the , a World War II battleship. The ship served in several battles {{against the forces of}} Imperial Japan in the Pacific theater during the war. Now de{{commissioned}}, {{it is part of the}} USS North Carolina Battleship Memorial in Wilmington. Another , a nuclear <b>attack</b> <b>submarine,</b> was commissioned in Wilmington, North Carolina, on May 3, 2008.|$|E
25|$|In {{his general}} order № 2 of 3 July 1940, Vice Admiral Émile Muselier, {{two days after}} {{assuming}} the post of chief of the naval and air forces of the Free French, created the naval jack displaying the French colours with a red cross of Lorraine, and a cockade, which also featured the cross of Lorraine. Modern ships that share the same name as ships of the FNFL (such as the nuclear <b>attack</b> <b>submarine</b> Rubis and nuclear ballistic missile submarine Le Triomphant), are entitled to fly the Free French naval jack as a mark of honour.|$|E
25|$|The Chang Bogo-class {{submarine}} (Hangul: 장보고급 잠수함, Hanja: 張保皐級潛水艦) is {{a variant}} of the Type 209 diesel-electric <b>attack</b> <b>submarine</b> initially developed by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) of Germany, intended for service with the South Korean Navy and Indonesian Navy. A Daewoo (DSME)-upgraded model of the Chang Bogo class Type 209 is being independently exported by Korea to Indonesia in 2012, after a series of heavy competitions from Russian, French, and German-Turkish consortiums including from Germany's original Type 209. The variant is being considered for possible purchase by Thailand as well, as both newly built and second-hand options. The class is named for ancient Korean maritime figure Jang Bogo.|$|E
50|$|Wolfpacks {{fell out}} of use during the Cold War; modern {{submarines}} have far better weapons and underwater speed than those of World War II, {{so there is no}} need for them to operate in large groups. Instead, the United States Navy deploys its <b>attack</b> <b>submarines</b> on individual patrols, with the exception of one or (rarely) two <b>attack</b> <b>submarines</b> in each carrier strike group.|$|R
5000|$|Occupied essentially, but not {{exclusively}} by operations of Anti-submarine warfare at the profit of deterrence, since {{the creation of}} the Strategic Oceanic Force, the employment scope range of the <b>attack</b> <b>submarines</b> was enlarged since the middle of the years of 1990 with the leveling placement of nuclear <b>attack</b> <b>submarines</b> which can act at the profit of Carrier battle groups and maritime action.|$|R
50|$|The base hosts China's Type 092-class {{ballistic}} missile submarine and Type 091-class nuclear <b>attack</b> <b>submarines.</b>|$|R
25|$|During World War II, {{the planned}} {{battleship}} USS Montana was {{named in honor}} of the state. However, the battleship was never completed. Montana {{is the only one of}} the first 48 states lacking a completed battleship being named for it. Alaska and Hawaii have both had nuclear submarines named after them. Montana is the only state in the union without a modern naval ship named in its honor. However, in August 2007 Senator Jon Tester made a request to the Navy that a submarine be christened USS Montana. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced on September 3, 2015 that Virginia Class <b>attack</b> <b>Submarine</b> SSN-794 will bear the state's namesake. This will be the second commissioned warship to bear the name Montana.|$|E
25|$|This {{class is}} the first Russian {{submarine}} to be equipped with a spherical sonar, designated as MGK-600 Irtysh-Amfora. The device (allegedly the Irtysh/Amfora sonar system) was tested on a modified Yankee class submarine. The sonar system consists of a spherical bow array, flank arrays and a towed array. Due to the large size of this spherical array, the torpedo tubes are slanted. In other words, the torpedo tube outer doors are not located in the immediate bow {{as in the previous}} Akula class but moved aft. The hull is constructed from low-magnetic steel. The submarine has a crew of about 90, suggesting a high degree of automation in the submarine's different systems. The newest USA <b>attack</b> <b>submarine,</b> the , has a crew of 134 in comparison.|$|E
25|$|During 2001–2006 {{there has}} been a rapid {{building}} and acquisition program. There were more than a dozen new classes of ships built in these last five years, totaling some 60 brand new ships (including landing ships and auxiliaries). Simultaneously, dozens of other ships have been either phased out of service or refitted with new equipment. Submarines {{play a significant role in}} the development of the PLAN's future fleet. This is made evident by the construction of a new type of nuclear ballistic missile submarine, the Type 094 and the Type 093 nuclear <b>attack</b> <b>submarine.</b> This will provide the PLAN with a more modern response for the need of a seaborne nuclear deterrent. The new submarines will also be capable of performing conventional strike and other special warfare requirements.|$|E

50|$|From 1975 to 1989, {{he assumed}} {{a variety of}} duties during his sea tour {{in the order of}} Weapons (Ballistic Missile) Officer, Navigation Head and Executive Officer on board <b>Attack</b> <b>Submarines.</b> He also {{returned}} to the Surface fleet briefly for a year to be the Executive Officer of an Anti-Submarine Frigate. He then served as the Commanding Officer of several <b>attack</b> <b>Submarines,</b> until 1994.|$|R
5000|$|Originally early {{designs of}} cruise missile {{submarines}} had to surface to launch their missiles, while later designs {{could do so}} underwater via dedicated vertical launching system (VLS) tubes. Many modern <b>attack</b> <b>submarines</b> can launch cruise missiles (and dedicated anti-ship missiles) from their torpedo tubes while some designs also incorporate {{a small number of}} VLS canisters, giving some significant overlap between cruise missile <b>submarines</b> and traditional <b>attack</b> <b>submarines.</b> Nonetheless, vessels classified as <b>attack</b> <b>submarines</b> still use torpedoes as their main armament and have a more multi-role mission profile due to their greater speed and maneuverability, in contrast to cruise missile submarines which are typically larger slower boats focused on the long distance surface strike role.|$|R
