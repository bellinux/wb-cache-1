5|$|Methoxyflurane is an {{extremely}} potent and highly lipid-soluble anesthetic agent, characterized by very slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times. It is non-flammable, has relatively mild hemodynamic effects, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> predispose the heart to rhythm disturbances. It is, however, a significant respiratory depressant. Methoxyflurane has powerful analgesic (pain-relieving) properties at well below full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for obstetric analgesia, {{in a manner that}} foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today.|$|E
5|$|M.lanuginosa {{closely resembles}} M.pilosella, a species {{originally}} described from Netherlands by Maas Geesteranus, and the European species M.zephirus; both {{are in the}} section Fragilipedes. Mycena pilosella differs in several microscopic characteristics: it has densely diverticulate elements of the cap cuticle; long, cylindrical caulocystidia that diverge at a right angle; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have pleurocystidia. Mycena zephirus is distinct in forming a whitish cap, a stem that is initially minutely hairly but later becomes smooth, radish-like odor, ellipsoid to cylindrical spores, and cheilocystidia with branches near the tip.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{methoxyflurane}} on the circulatory system {{resemble those of}} diethyl ether. In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate decrease in blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate, and no significant effect on blood sugar, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Bleeding and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) both induce further decreases in blood pressure, as well as increases in blood glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine. In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease in blood pressure, but cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance are only minimally depressed. Its effect on the pulmonary circulation is negligible, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> predispose the heart to cardiac dysrhythmias.|$|E
5|$|Video {{fluoroscopy}} uses {{x-ray radiation}} to produce moving {{pictures of the}} mouth during articulation or swallowing. It is considered the gold standard in studies of dysphagia because {{of its ability to}} take videos of the entire digestive tract during swallowing events. It is often used to study and treat aspiration of food, what parts of the digestive tract are malfunctioning during swallowing, and positions in which swallowing is easiest. Only limited data is able to be collected as sessions are typically limited to three minutes due to the hazards of radiation exposure. <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> allow for fine grain analysis of tongue movements.|$|E
5|$|The subalpine waxy cap (Hygrophorus subalpinus) is {{somewhat}} similar in appearance to R.brevipes but lacks its brittle flesh, {{and it has}} a sticky, glutinous cap. The Pacific Northwest species Russula cascadensis also resembles R.brevipes, but has an acrid taste and smaller fruit bodies. Another lookalike, R.vesicatoria, has gills that often fork near the stipe attachment. R.angustispora is quite similar to R.brevipes, but has narrower spores measuring 6.5–8.5 by 4.5–5µm, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have the pale greenish band that sometimes develops in the latter species. The European look-alike R.delica is widely distributed, although rarer in the northern regions of the continent. Similar to R.brevipes in overall morphology, it has somewhat larger spores (9–12 by 7–8.5µm) with a surface ornamentation featuring prominent warts interconnected by a zebra-like patterns of ridges. The milk-cap mushroom Lactifluus piperatus can be distinguished from R.brevipes by the production of latex when the mushroom tissue is cut or injured.|$|E

5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is {{the brightest star}} system in the night sky, almost twice {{the brightness of the}} second brightest star, Canopus. It is not as bright as the Moon, Venus, or Jupiter; at times, Mercury and Mars are also brighter than Sirius. Sirius can be seen from almost everywhere on Earth, with only observers north of 73 degrees latitude unable to see it, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> rise very high when viewed from some northern cities, reaching only 13° above the horizon from Saint Petersburg. Sirius, along with Procyon and Betelgeuse, forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle to observers in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its declination of roughly −17°, Sirius is a circumpolar star from latitudes south of 73° S. From the Southern Hemisphere in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the Sun, and in the morning where it rises before the Sun. Due to precession (and slight proper motion), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be −67° and thus it will be circumpolar throughout South Africa and in most parts of Australia.|$|E
