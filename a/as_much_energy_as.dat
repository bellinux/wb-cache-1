5|$|The main use {{of uranium}} in the {{civilian}} sector is to fuel nuclear power plants. One kilogram of uranium-235 can theoretically produce about 20terajoules of energy (2joules), assuming complete fission; <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> 1500 tonnes of coal.|$|E
5|$|From the first, {{research}} into the Super was directed by Teller, who was its most enthusiastic proponent. Although this work was always considered secondary to the objective of developing a fission bomb, the prospect of creating more powerful bombs was sufficient to keep it going. The Berkeley summer conference had convinced Teller that the Super was technologically feasible. An important contribution was made by Emil Konopinski, who suggested that deuterium could more easily be ignited if it was mixed with tritium. Bethe noted that a tritium-deuterium (T-D) reaction releases five times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> a deuterium-deuterium (D-D) reaction. This was not immediately followed up, because tritium was hard to obtain, and there were hopes that deuterium could be easily ignited by a fission bomb, but the cross sections of T-D and D-D were measured by Manley's group in Chicago and Holloway's at Purdue.|$|E
5|$|Herschel wedges, {{also called}} Solar Diagonals, are {{effective}} and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is {{destined for the}} eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface {{of a piece of}} glass. Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected. The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.|$|E

25|$|The {{achievements}} of SpaceShipOne are more {{comparable to the}} X-15 than orbiting spacecraft like the Space Shuttle. Accelerating a spacecraft to orbital speed requires more than 60 times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> accelerating it to Mach 3. It would also require an elaborate heat shield to safely dissipate that energy during re-entry.|$|E
25|$|All proto- and mid-life stars radiate {{enormous}} amounts of energy generated by fusion processes. Mass for mass, the deuterium–tritium fusion process releases roughly three times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> uranium-235 fission, and millions of times more energy than a chemical reaction such as the burning of coal. It {{is the goal of}} a fusion power station to harness this energy to produce electricity.|$|E
25|$|Extra {{energetic}} photons: Photons travelling through galaxy clusters should gain {{energy and}} then lose it {{again on the}} way out. The accelerating expansion of the Universe should stop the photons returning all the energy, but even taking this into account photons from {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation gain twice <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> expected.

25|$|Reactor efficiency. Conventional {{reactors}} consume {{less than}} one percent of the mined uranium, leaving the rest as waste. With perfectly working reprocessing LFTR may consume up to about 99% of its thorium fuel. The improved fuel efficiency means that 1 ton of natural thorium in a LFTR produces <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> 35 t of enriched uranium in conventional reactors (requiring 250 t of natural uranium), or 4,166,000 tons of black coal in a coal power plant.|$|E
25|$|Through a {{laboratory}} experiment, {{it was discovered}} that the quality of the food Vespula vulgaris consumes directly affects its body temperature. The higher the quality of the prey, measured by the amount of sucrose present in the food, the higher thorax temperature it had. Such high thorax temperature indicates the wasp's excitement and motivation to collect the offered food. The wasps will want to absorb <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> possible because the output of the energy directly coordinates to the power of flight muscles. Higher thorax temperature therefore means more power in thoracic flight muscles, leading to faster movement and in overall, more foraging.|$|E

25|$|Adults of C. cadaverina {{lay their}} eggs in open wounds or natural body {{openings}} on carrion, typically in small clusters or scattered singly. The eggs usually hatch out within 24 to 72 hours depending on the season. The eggs will then hatch into larvae that will go through three instars (stages). Each one of these stages is separated by a molt. During a molt, the larvae shed its outer layer {{in order to accommodate}} for new growth that comes with increased consumption of food needed for energy stores. The first instar typically lasts for approximately 20 hours, while the second instar lasts for 16 hours followed by the third instar for 72 hours. After the larvae have completed their development and stored <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> possible, they disperse to a safe area to complete their next stage, the pupal stage. This stage lasts for about 9 days before the fly finally emerges as an adult. The total lifecycle of C. cadaverina can take anywhere from 17–19 days depending on the temperature.|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} long-duration gamma-ray bursts {{produce a}} total energy output of about 1044 joules (<b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> our Sun will produce in its entire life-time) {{but in a}} period of only 20 to 40 seconds. Gamma rays are approximately 50% of the total energy output. The leading hypotheses for the mechanism of production of these highest-known intensity beams of radiation, are inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation from high-energy charged particles. These processes occur as relativistic charged particles leave the region of the event horizon of a newly formed black hole created during supernova explosion. The beam of particles moving at relativistic speeds are focused for a few tens of seconds by the magnetic field of the exploding hypernova. The fusion explosion of the hypernova drives the energetics of the process. If the narrowly directed beam happens to be pointed toward the Earth, it shines at gamma ray frequencies with such intensity, that it can be detected even at distances of up to 10 billion light years, which is close {{to the edge of the}} visible universe.|$|E
500|$|Neptune's {{more varied}} weather when {{compared}} to Uranus {{is due in part}} to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune lies over 50% farther from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of [...] At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals , the temperature is [...] Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> <b>as</b> it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.|$|E
