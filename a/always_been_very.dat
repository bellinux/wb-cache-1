25|$|Shree Jagannath has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> {{close to}} the people of Bengal. In fact, upon visiting the main temple at Puri, almost 60% of the present pilgrims can be found to be from Bengal. Besides, Ratha Yatra is pompously celebrated in West Bengal, where Lord Jagannath is worshipped {{extensively}} in Bengal homes and temples. The day also marks the beginning of preparations for Bengal's biggest religious festival, the Durga Puja. This extensive popularity of Shree Jagannath among Bengalis can be related to Shree Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} Krishnamurti had {{developed}} a strong bond with Annie Besant and came to view her as a surrogate mother. His father, who had initially assented to Besant's legal guardianship of Krishnamurti, was pushed into the background by the swirl of attention around his son. In 1912 he sued Besant to annul the guardianship agreement. After a protracted legal battle Besant took custody of Krishnamurti and Nitya. As {{a result of this}} separation from family and home Krishnamurti and his brother (whose relationship had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> close) became more dependent on each other, and in the following years often travelled together.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous {{people that}} {{lived on the}} river include Karen, Nu, Lisu, Shan, Karenni, Wa, Tai, Mon, and Yintailai. The river {{has served as the}} only {{connection}} between villages in the region for thousands of years. Although unnavigable by larger craft such as barges or ferries, the river was widely used for transportation by small boats, because the rugged surrounding terrain had no major roads or paths. The southern part of the river has often been the setting of conflicts between the Burmese and Thai over political issues. The majority of the population living on the river has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> poor, even in poverty, and the region remains largely agricultural.|$|E
25|$|The species {{inhabited}} riparian Caraibeira (Tabebuia aurea) woodland {{galleries in}} the drainage basin of the Rio São Francisco within the Caatinga dry forest climate of interior northeastern Brazil. It {{had a very}} restricted natural habitat due to its dependence on the tree for nesting, feeding and roosting. It fed primarily on seeds and nuts of Caraiba and various Euphorbiaceae (spurge) shrubs, the dominant vegetation of the Caatinga. Due to deforestation in its limited range and specialized habitat, the bird has been rare in the wild throughout the twentieth century. It has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> rare in captivity, {{partly due to the}} remoteness of its natural range.|$|E

Multinational and Brazilian companies, such as Google and Oi, maintain offices in the city. The service sector plays a very important role in the economy of Belo Horizonte, being responsible for 85% of the city's gross domestic product (GDP), with the industry making up for most of the remaining 15%. Belo Horizonte has a developed industrial sector, being traditionally a hub of the Brazilian siderurgical and metallurgical industries, as the state of Minas Gerais has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> rich in minerals, specifically iron ore.|$|E
25|$|Põhja-Kõrvemaa Nature Reserve was {{established}} in the end of 1991, a few months after Estonia regained its independence. Throughout the Soviet Era {{a large part of the}} nature reserve's current territory was used by Soviet Army for military training and as such was closed to the public. The proving grounds were established in 1947 and in 1953 expanded to 33 304 ha (333km2), making it the biggest Soviet military polygon in Estonia. Still, the Soviet Army damaged only about 10% of the proving grounds' territory, leaving the rest intact. Due to unsuitability for agriculture (poor and/or badly drained soils) the whole region has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> sparsely populated – in the beginning of the 1950s the population density was around 1 people per km2 – but still a few hundred people were displaced together with the creation of proving ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} a {{university}} had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> sensitive in Abkhazia. Sukhumi State University was established in 1978 {{as a part of}} the concessions towards the Abkhaz secessionist demands, which in its turn was triggered by the Georgian national mobilization in defense of their language and culture. The university had three sectors: Abkhaz, Georgian, and Russian. However, Georgian students repeatedly complained of discrimination at the hands of their Abkhaz and Russian lectors and administration. In the aftermath of the 9 April events, Georgian students at Sukhumi State University started a hunger strike, calling for the Georgian sector of the university to be transformed into a branch of Tbilisi State University, and in effect controlled by Georgians and not Abkhaz. Joined by students and faculty from the Subropical Institute, this was part of a campaign started by ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia for greater cultural separation, and more clear division between the two ethnic groups. Aware it would cause unrest in Abkhazia, the authorities approved the measure on 14 May. In response Abkhaz organized a sit-in. The Supreme Soviet in Moscow also launched a commission, which ruled that the Georgians had no authority to establish the university, as that was solely under its purview. They concluded that a region the size of Abkhazia had no need for two universities. It also found that despite Georgian claims they were discriminated against under the language system in place, they had a higher percent of applications than the Abkhaz sector (33.5% for the Georgian compared to 24% for Abkhaz; the Russian, which would have had applicants from all three groups, saw 42.5% of all applications.|$|E

500|$|Canonsburg has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> {{proud to}} be the birthplace of Perry Como; the local {{newspaper}} of the time, Canonsburg Daily Notes, {{seems to have been}} the first to write an article about him. Their edition of July 19, 1934, featured a photo and the following: [...] "A young Canonsburg boy threatens to snatch the crown from Bing Crosby's head. Perry Como, son of Mr. and Mrs. Pietro Como of 530 Franklin Ave. is said to have one of the grandest baritone voices in the country." [...] The borough honored him three times {{over the course of his}} life. The first of these events took place September 14, 1946, when Third Street, where Perry worked in the barber shop of Steve Fragapane, was renamed [...] "Perry Como Avenue".

They released a compilation CD, Eternal Youth, in mid-2011 to compile selected works from their numerous split EPs, demos and out-of-print extended plays. When asked about leaving Hassle to form their own record label, the band stated [...] "We were questioning what we were doing for our label that we couldn't do ourselves.

[...] The band announced in early February 2012 that both Joseph Thorpe and Joe Nicholson had left the band. This was because Joe Nicholson wanted to read chemistry at university, while Thorpe's reasons were related to personal differences. The band replaced both with Chris Cayford, who is the current frontman and former guitarist of No Coast, and Nathan Fairweather, who plays in Brontide, making this the first release with the new line-up.|$|E
