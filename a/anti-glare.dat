5|$|The unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely {{follows the}} styling of the {{original}} aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display. The screen is high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an <b>anti-glare</b> matte option {{is available in the}} 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed. The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button. The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures. When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad. The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anti-glare</b> {{protection}} glasses, or anti-reflective glasses, {{can reduce}} the reflection of light that enters our eyes. The lenses are given an <b>anti-glare</b> coating to prevent reflections of light under different lighting conditions. By {{reducing the amount of}} glare on your eyes, vision can be improved. The <b>anti-glare</b> also applies to the outer glass, thus allowing for better eye contact.|$|E
25|$|The sole {{completed}} prototype was {{in natural}} metal finish; some paintings show a black <b>anti-glare</b> area {{in front of}} the cockpit, but this is not seen on any of the known photographs of the plane.|$|E
25|$|Anti-reflective {{coatings}} {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of applications where light passes through an optical surface, and low loss or low reflection is desired. Examples include <b>anti-glare</b> coatings on corrective lenses and camera lens elements, and antireflective coatings on solar cells.|$|E
25|$|The MacBook Air is {{designed}} for thinness, and is also lighter than most competing models. The computer features an <b>anti-glare</b> LED backlit display and a full-size keyboard, {{as well as a}} large trackpad that responds to multi-touch gestures such as pinching, swiping, and rotating. With the release of Snow Leopard, the Air's trackpad also supports handwriting recognition of Chinese characters.|$|E
25|$|By July 1969 a three-door wagon version {{intended}} for private use arrived, the LS11 Suzuki Fronte Estate, to give passenger car buyers a model with more luggage room without {{the indignity of}} having to buy a commercial vehicle. The Estate had the same top-hinged rear opening, but featured a more comfortable, while still folding, rear seat. There was also a folding luggage shelf in the trunk. Sops to safety, already somewhat better than the regular Fronte because of the engine location and the driver's seat being located farther back, included an <b>anti-glare</b> dashboard and a round horn pad in the steering wheel.|$|E
25|$|Type S: Three {{variations}} {{were seen}} on Ki-84s; S1 – Dark green upper surfaces, with light gray/green lower surfaces. S2 – The light gray/green {{on the lower}} surfaces {{was replaced by a}} pale blue/gray. These colors were often applied on an unprimed airframe; because of this and the poor adhesion of Japanese paints in the later years of the war this scheme often weathered quickly, with large patches of natural metal being visible (see photo of 85 Hiko-Sentai Ki-84 on a Korean base). S10 – The upper surfaces were left in a red/brown primer with the under surfaces in natural metal. The black <b>anti-glare</b> panel was optional.|$|E
25|$|Internationalized ECE Regulation 48, {{in force}} {{in most of}} the world outside North America, {{currently}} specifies a limited range within which the vertical aim of the headlamps must be maintained under various vehicle load conditions; if the vehicle isn't equipped with an adaptive suspension sufficient to keep the headlamps aimed correctly regardless of load, a headlamp leveling system is required. The regulation stipulates a more stringent version of this <b>anti-glare</b> measure if the vehicle has headlamps with low beam light source(s) that produce more than 2,000 lumens – xenon bulbs and certain high-power halogens, for example. Such vehicles must be equipped with headlamp self-leveling systems that sense the vehicle's degree of squat due to cargo load and road inclination, and automatically adjust the headlamps' vertical aim to keep the beam correctly oriented without any action required by the driver.|$|E
500|$|During the MacWorld Expo keynote on January 6, 2009, Phil Schiller {{announced}} a 17-inch MacBook Pro with unibody construction. This version diverged from its 15-inch sibling with an <b>anti-glare</b> [...] "matte" [...] screen option (with the glossy finish standard) and a non user-removable lithium polymer battery. Instead of traditional round cells inside the casing, the lithium-ion polymer batteries are shaped and fitted into each laptop to maximally utilize space. Adaptive charging, {{which uses a}} chip to optimize the charge flow to reduce wear and tear, extends the battery's overall life. Battery life for the 17" [...] version is quoted at eight hours, with 80percent of this charge remaining after 1,000 charge-discharge cycles.|$|E
500|$|At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 8, 2009, it was {{announced}} that the 13-inch unibody MacBook would be upgraded and re-branded as a MacBook Pro, leaving only the white polycarbonate MacBook in the MacBook line. It was also announced that the entire MacBook Pro line would use the non user-removable battery first introduced in the 17-inch MacBook Pro. The updated MacBook Pro 13- and the 15-inch would each have up to a claimed seven hours of battery life, while the 17-inch would keep its eight-hour capacity. Some sources even reported up to eight hours of battery life for the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros during casual use, while others reported around six hours. Like the 17-inch MacBook Pro, Apple claims that they will last around 1,000 charge cycles while still containing 80percent of their capacity. Graphics card options stayed the same from the previous release, although the 13-inch and the base model 15-inch, came with only the GeForce 9400M GPU. The screens were also improved, gaining a claimed 60percent greater color gamut. All of these mid 2009 models also included a FireWire 800 port and all except the 17-inch models would receive an SD card slot. The 17-inch model would retain its ExpressCard/34 slot. For the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the Kensington lock slot was moved to {{the right side of the}} chassis. In August 2009, Apple extended the [...] "matte" [...] <b>anti-glare</b> display option to the 15-inch MacBook Pro.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cladding}} system {{consists of}} [...] {{of more than}} 26,000 reflective glass panels and aluminium and textured stainless steel spandrel panels with vertical tubular fins.

In total the glass covers more than [...]|$|E
2500|$|In late 1999, several {{noteworthy}} {{changes for}} the P11 came as a refresh in the 2000 model year, when the 145 crank horsepower roller rocker variant of the SR20DE engine was implemented, newer automatic and manual transmission variations were introduced, anti-theft immobilizer circuitry was added, <b>anti-glare</b> side mirrors became standard, and a remote trunk release {{was added to the}} keyless entry fob. In 2001, the G20t was dropped and a Sport model was introduced. In addition to the prior G20t's limited slip differential and decklid spoiler, this model featured two-tone leather/suede sport seats, 16" [...] wheels, and a variety of minor cosmetic modifications. The 2002 base G20 received the 12-spoke Touring alloy wheels as standard.|$|E

50|$|A 2003 {{study by}} Brian DeBroff and Patricia Pahk tested whether black eye grease {{actually}} had <b>anti-glare</b> properties. The {{subjects of the}} study were divided into three groups: wearers of eye black, wearers of <b>anti-glare</b> stickers, and wearers of petroleum jelly. The subjects' vision was tested using an eye chart while being exposed to natural sunlight.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} type of <b>anti-glare</b> filter {{consists of a}} coating that reduces the reflection from a glass or plastic surface. These are manufactured from polycarbonate or acrylic plastic. An older variety of <b>anti-glare</b> filter used a mesh filter that had {{the appearance of a}} nylon screen. Although effective, a mesh filter also caused degradation of the image quality.|$|E

50|$|StarTech.com {{was founded}} in 1985 in London, Ontario, Canada by Paul Seed and Ken Kalopsis. The company’s first {{products}} to enter the IT market were <b>anti-glare</b> screens for CRT computer monitors, and keyboard dust covers.|$|E
50|$|Glare is {{difficulty}} {{seeing in}} the presence of bright light such as direct or reflected sunlight or artificial light such as car headlamps at night. Because of this, some cars include mirrors with automatic <b>anti-glare</b> functions.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{always the}} dark areas of a display are {{corrupted}} by reflected light, reasonable [...] "ambient contrast" [...] values {{can only be}} maintained when the display is provided with efficient measures to reduce reflections by anti reflection and/or <b>anti-glare</b> coatings.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{aluminum}} and glass models were launched on October 14, 2008, Apple removed the matte, <b>anti-glare</b> screen panels in its Cinema Display lineup, {{except for the}} 30" [...] Cinema Display. Apple moved away from matte screens in its line of iMac desktop computers on August 7, 2007. Apple no longer offers any equipment with a matte, <b>anti-glare</b> screen after the 15" [...] non-Retina MacBook Pro was discontinued in October 2013. This has caused concern among users who want matte screens for their particular area of work, particularly graphic designers, photographers and users who extensively view their screens. Matte screens, like matte-surface photographs, diffuse reflected light and so cannot provide for as deep blacks as glossy screens.|$|E
50|$|Anti-reflective {{coatings}} {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of applications where light passes through an optical surface, and low loss or low reflection is desired. Examples include <b>anti-glare</b> coatings on corrective lenses and camera lens elements, and antireflective coatings on solar cells.|$|E

50|$|Some displays, {{especially}} newer LCD monitors, {{replace the}} traditional <b>anti-glare</b> matte {{finish with a}} glossy one. This increases color saturation and sharpness but reflections from lights and windows are very visible. Anti-reflective coatings are sometimes applied to help reduce reflections, although this only mitigates the effect.|$|E
