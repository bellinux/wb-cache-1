50|$|Some {{intergovernmental}} organizations, {{such as the}} European Union, {{and some}} international non-state organizations, such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, may also retain diplomatic services in other jurisdictions. For non-state organizations, however, the reciprocation of diplomatic recognition by other jurisdictions is difficult, as diplomacy tends to establish the concept of recognition upon an assumed sovereignty over geographical territory; the SMOM, in this case, receives diplomats at its headquarters in Rome, as all permanent missions to the SMOM are jointly <b>accredited</b> as permanent <b>missions</b> to the Holy See. In relation, many more non-state international organizations, such as the IFRC/ICRC, maintain permanent non-voting observer status to intergovernmental bodies such as the United Nations General Assembly, appointing individual representatives to the observer office.|$|R
25|$|Of the {{diplomatic}} <b>missions</b> <b>accredited</b> to the Holy See, 69 are situated in Rome, although those countries, if {{they also have}} an embassy to Italy, then have two embassies in the same city, since, by agreement between the Holy See and Italy, the same person cannot {{at the same time}} be accredited to both. The United Kingdom recently housed its embassy to the Holy See in the same building as its embassy to the Italian Republic, a move that led to a diplomatic protest from the Holy See. An ambassador accredited to a country other than Italy can be accredited also to the Holy See. For reasons of economy, therefore, smaller countries accredit to the Holy See a mission situated elsewhere and accredited also to the country of residence and perhaps other countries.|$|R
50|$|The {{municipality}} has two of {{the five}} Franciscan <b>missions</b> <b>accredited</b> to JunÃ­pero Serra during his evangelization of the Sierra Gorda.

The main portal is dominated by various forms of plants most local to the region. European elements include images of saints and the Franciscan coat of arms. Native elements include a double headed eagle with a snake as well as an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe.|$|R
25|$|In 1740, {{the colonial}} {{government}} decided to exterminate indigenous resistance here to secure trade routes to Guanajuato and Zacatecas.

The military pacification of the area by JosÃ© de EscandÃ³n in the 1740s allowed for the building of permanent missions {{in the heart of}} the Sierra Gorda. However, the five Franciscans <b>missions</b> <b>accredited</b> to JunÃ­pero Serra were built in Pame territory, as these people were more accepting of Spanish domination. The Spanish decided to burn original Pame villages and resettle the population around missions for better control. Those who did not submit either committed suicide or went to live in the mountains. The placement of the missions had the purpose of dividing the heart of the Sierra Gorda and to open roads into San Luis PotosÃ­.|$|R

2500|$|During the 16th and 17th century, {{there were}} {{attempts}} to evangelize the Sierra Gorda of QuerÃ©taro by the Augustinians, Franciscans and Dominicans.

[...] However, the vision for the building of the missions was Serraâs, as he imagined a type of utopia based on Franciscan principles. Serra insisted that the missionaries learn the local languages and experience hunger along with the rest of the population. There was still hostility to the Spanish presence, and Serraâs response was economic as well as spiritual.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the year, the war had {{developed}} {{in such a way that}} the new SAS detachment would not be needed in Persia. General Wilson was being transferred to Middle East Command, and Maclean extracted a promise that the newly trained troops would go with him, as their style of commando raids were ideal for southern and eastern Europe. [...] Frustrated by the abandoning of plans for an assault on Crete, Maclean went to see Reginald Leeper, [...] "an old friend from Foreign Office days, and now His Majesty's Ambassador to the Greek Government then in exile in Cairo". Leeper put in a word for him, and very soon Maclean was told to go to London to get his instructions directly from the prime minister. Churchill told him to parachute into Jugoslavia (now spelled Yugoslavia) as head of a military <b>mission</b> <b>accredited</b> to Josip Broz Tito (a shadowy figure at that point) or whoever was in charge of the Partisans, the Communist-led resistance movement. Mihajlovic's royalist Cetniks (now spelled Chetniks), which the Allies had been supporting, did not appear to be fighting the Germans very hard, and indeed were said to be collaborating with the enemy. [...] Maclean famously paraphrased Churchill: [...] "My task was simply to help find out who was killing the most Germans and suggest means by which we could help them to kill more." [...] The prime minister saw Maclean as [...] "a daring Ambassador-leader to these hardy and hunted guerillas".|$|R

It also contains a community museum called the Museo Comunitario Lucio Balderas MÃ¡rquez, which displays historical photographs, documents and more related to the community and municipality. The feast of Francis of Assisi in Tilaco takes place over the week of 4 October, with activities such as events called jaripeos, horse racing, popular dances, sports and traditional dances in traditional outfits, which is unique to the town. It is off the main highway of the municipality, with access by a narrow roads that leads to it from La Lagunita, a road built by the parish priest and Juan Cesar Lugo, a migrant worker from La Lagunita. The town of Tilaco received a parish priest, a {{man by the name of}} Francisco Isidro Pinol Miracle in 1958. At the time, the town was cut off from the rest of the municipality. The priest worked hard to have a road built to connect Tilaco with Highway 120 and also work to have the mission church restored, using an old truck lent to him by Juan Cesar Lugo. Miracle died in 2003, but he is honored in the town by a square named after him.|$|R
