5|$|A {{security}} guard who discovers he has superhuman levels of strength, stamina, and invulnerability, {{as well as}} an extrasensory <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the crimes people have committed by touching them.|$|E
5|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle a spiritualist who {{supported}} the mediumship of Home stated that he was unusual in that he had four different types of mediumship: direct voice (the ability to let spirits audibly speak); trance speaker (the ability to let spirits speak through oneself); clairvoyant (<b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> things {{that are out of}} view); and physical medium (moving objects at a distance, levitation, etc., which was the type of mediumship in which he had no equal).|$|E
5|$|Tactical Realism: a {{variation}} of the standard competitive multiplayer modes, added with the release of the Operation Skull Rain DLC. The game mode features a heavier emphasis on realism and teamwork, removing most of the heads-up display (HUD) elements, the ability to mark opponents, and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> teammates' contours through walls, while also featuring the addition of a realistic ammo management system.|$|E

50|$|Define the universe. Describe {{the overall}} {{population}} of students eligible {{to enroll in}} the course and then consider their potential diverse characteristics (e.g., with respect to gender; age; ethnicity and race; native language; learning style; and <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> hear, manipulate objects, read, and communicate).|$|R
50|$|A female classmate who was {{a victim}} during a Reset. It is hinted that her <b>ability</b> is <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the future.|$|R
5|$|The underconnectivity theory hypothesizes {{underfunctioning}} high-level neural {{connections and}} synchronization, {{along with an}} excess of low-level processes. It maps well to general-processing theories such as weak central coherence theory, which hypothesizes that a limited <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the big picture underlies the central disturbance in ASD. A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals.|$|E
5|$|Black {{attempts}} to locate further {{information about the}} Millennium Group's activity, having believed them defeated in 1999. He finds that his access to their old computer systems still works, and learns that they may know the whereabouts of his daughter Jordan. Spurred on by several momentary encounters with similarly demonic beings, Black returns to his home town of Seattle, Washington. As he visits the grave of his wife Catherine, he is tranquilised and apprehended by Group members. Waking in captivity, he learns that they seek his help against the same demonic forces he has been encountering—and that Jordan is now a willing initiate of the Group. She has now begun to powerfully manifest visions of the future, similar to Black's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the past through others' eyes.|$|E
5|$|Several {{designs for}} the exact method of {{destroying}} the target were suggested. One of these {{was to have the}} satellite carry out a kamikaze attack on the target, while another was to coat it with black paint, blocking its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> or transmit, rendering it inoperable. Yet another was for it to use a laser to disable reconnaissance or optical sensors of the target. Another suggestion was for the satellite to carry a nuclear missile, of up to one megaton yield, and launch it at the satellite. However, in July 1959, Joseph V. Charyk directed that all technical efforts were to be focused on developing the inspection function, rather than the kill function, effectively ending its role as a satellite interceptor, and shifting the project {{to the development of a}} satellite inspector.|$|E

50|$|Dante Dante is {{the second}} recruit of The Dagger Society and was once a {{blacksmith}} apprentice. His mark from the blood fever is dark, irregular markings that stretch from across his neck to part of his chest. He’s known as the Spider for his strength in his hands <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in darkness. From the very beginning he was wary of Adelina’s presence on the team and shown the most hatred towards Adelina {{compared to the other}} members of The Dagger Society.|$|R
5000|$|The series follows {{along with}} a girl named Susannah [...] "Suze" [...] Simon and her {{experiences}} as a teenage mediator - {{a person who has}} <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> touch and talk to ghosts, and main goal is to help them to the [...] "Great Beyond" [...] (after life). She is able to travel to the Shadow Land (Land of Damnation). In the end of the series, Suze finds out that she is able to travel in time. The books are written in first-person narrative from Suze's perspective.|$|R
5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are needed}} because radar {{systems such as}} NEXRAD do not detect a tornado; merely signatures which hint at the presence of tornadoes. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder {{encounters}} a delusional man, Gary Lambert (Brian Markinson), who believes his boss, Greg Pincus (John Apicella), may be a monster—and decides to take an entire office building, including Mulder, hostage to prove it. Lambert is eventually killed, but somehow, Mulder inherits his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Pincus as a monster. After Mulder claims that Pincus is a monster, he is locked in a psychiatric hospital, only to be saved by Scully: {{the only person who}} believes him.|$|E
5|$|Watts later shows Black {{a picture}} {{taken at the}} murder scene, with Sammael {{recognizable}} among a crowd of people. Elsewhere, a man named Martin (Guy Fauchon) is arrested after slitting a babysitter's throat at a public park; despite the seemingly random nature of the crime, Black believes that the man may be connected to Bletcher's murder. However, he soon starts to suspect that Martin may be innocent of the crime he has been arrested for. Black also has a dream in which a mutilated Bletcher tries and fails to speak to him, which leads Black to believe he has lost his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> into the minds of others.|$|E

50|$|The British Empire {{is falling}} apart. Many commoners {{are unhappy with}} the current government, though none of the commoners claim {{responsibility}} for the status quo. The magician's demons are being assaulted by the children's natural <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and resist the demons. Some commoners advocate slow reform, while others advocate open revolt, while still others say the commoners should learn how to summon spirits of their own to combat those spirits belonging to the magicians. Ptolemy's Gate concludes with a council of surviving magicians and important commoners {{trying to work out}} a government that is beneficial to everyone.|$|R
50|$|Her block {{printing}} thesis {{grew out of}} the home industries/arts and crafts movements of the past. Apart from design theory, her classes focused on the practicality of hand-producing decorations for the home. The idea of fine art for home use {{was one of the main}} factors driving and maintaining the popularity of the movement within the neighborhood. To this end her design course helped members <b>to</b> refine their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the elements of design in the world around them. Also important was the attention to the craftsmanship of carving the linoleum, and then printing on the fabric itself.|$|R
5|$|While Massive Dynamic {{offers its}} {{computing}} resources to identify possible buildings of similar mass, Walter implores Olivia (Anna Torv) to recall her childhood Cortexiphan-induced <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{objects from the}} alternate universe, believing she {{will be able to}} foresee which building will be affected and warn everyone in time. He takes her to the disused child-care facility in Jacksonville, Florida, where the Cortexiphan trials were performed. Walter first puts Olivia under heavy sedation, and she experiences meeting her younger, frightened self, but is still unable to trigger her ability. Olivia begins to remember the gruesome trials she experienced, including footage from one test where she exhibited pyrokinesis. As Walter's deadline nears, he realizes that Olivia is no longer frightened and thus she cannot engage her abilities, which were triggered by fear.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing as}} Aiden, the game becomes monochromatic. Amongst the shades of greys, {{interactive}} objects are highlighted by an aura shining {{in one of}} several colours, with the colour of the aura indicating his potential interaction: orange characters can be possessed, red characters strangled, blue objects (or characters with environmental effects) knocked around, and green characters healed. Jodie frequently calls upon Aiden to provide different abilities, such as form a protective shield around her, allow the dead {{to speak to the}} living through her, grant her an <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> events of the recent past, and enable her to heal a character's wounds.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} his {{leadership}} and his coup d'œil, the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> at a glance {{what needed to be}} done, occurred after the Battle of Kolin. The loss at Kolin forced the King to lift the siege at Prague. The King's brother, Augustus William, took command of the army and ordered the retreat from Prague. Seydlitz was attached to the advanced corps of Karl Christoph von Schmettau in a brigade of ten squadrons. As Seydlitz's wing entered Lusatia, near the town of Zittau, the Austrians were present in force, and Seydlitz with his squadrons were trapped in the town. Tricking the Austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party, his cavalry burst on the Austrian cavalry before they could climb into their saddles. Seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape, in close column, and was quickly out of sight.|$|E
25|$|On several occasions, armed groups {{denied access}} to IDPs by {{humanitarian}} organizations or obstructed their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> deliver supplies (<b>see</b> section 1.g.).|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the changes}} that occur when {{processing}} visual stimuli (distance, viewing angle, illumination, etc.), the brain has the unique <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> retain knowledge of constant and essential properties of an object and discard irrelevant dynamic properties. This applies not only <b>to</b> the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> always <b>see</b> a banana as the color yellow but also the recognition of faces at varying angles.|$|R
25|$|As with humans, {{advanced}} years often bring {{changes in}} a dog's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> hear, <b>see</b> and move about easily. Skin condition, appetite and energy levels often degrade with geriatric age, and medical conditions such as cancer, renal failure, arthritis and joint conditions, and other signs of old age, may appear.|$|R
5|$|Before her stasis {{aboard the}} Spear of Adun, Rohana was a driven protoss {{who was not}} afraid to seek out tasks others thought impossible. She {{displayed}} strict adherence to tradition, yet was creative {{when faced with the}} issues. After she was awakened, Rohana held on to the old ways of the Protoss Empire, openly speaking out against her Nerazim crew, Artanis' Terran allies, and the reawakening of the Purifiers. She served as a reminder of the past, clinging to old traditions and ways, and refusing to cut her connection from the Khala even as Amon continued to possess her, stating knowledge and history {{was the only thing that}} brought unity to the protoss. Though Artanis valued her memories and her <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> into Amon's thoughts, he began to grow weary of her adherence to the old ways and her objections to his choices, becoming more of a critic than a councilor. Eventually, she came to terms with the Daelaam, and cut herself from the Khala, stating that perhaps history did not need to be recorded with perfect clarity.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in one of}} Eorzea's {{three main}} states, the player {{character}} awakes to the Echo, a power granting them the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the past. The Adventurers are initially involved in both conflicts within the nations provoked by the Garlean pretense, led by the Garlean Legatus Gaius Van Baelsar, and the Beastmen's attempts to summon their Primals and their consequent hoarding of crystal supplies. Eventually, a greater threat is {{brought to the attention}} of the nations by the Sharlayan scholar Louisoix Leveilleur: another Garlean Legatus named Nael Van Darnus is using arcane magic and technology to summon Dalamud, the planet's second moon, down on Eorzea to purge the Beastmen and Primals. With the aid of Garlean defector Cid nan Garlond, the Adventurers discover that Nael has set up a beacon for summoning Dalamud in the new fortress of Castrum Novum. While each nation makes individual attempts to storm the fortress, they are repelled. Faced with this, their leaders form a pact and unite the nations under the banner of the Eorzean Alliance.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Chadwick was {{appointed}} Dean of Christ Church, uniquely a dual {{role as a}} cathedral dean and head of a college. This period was not entirely happy; a scholarly <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> all sides of a question, along with an ingrained desire not to upset his colleagues, sometimes made it {{hard for him to}} make a quick or firm decision. However, during his time as Dean the college benefited from a continued programme of renovation with internal changes that provided more student accommodation. The position gave Chadwick the chance to influence the musical direction of the cathedral. In The Independent newspaper, obituary writer Andrew Louth notes that at the retirement of Sydney Watson as organist, when he and Chadwick played piano duets together Chadwick's technique was the equal of Watson's. The new organist, Simon Preston, had ambitious plans for improving musical standards, and Chadwick was pleased to be able to support these, not least by raising funds for a new organ.|$|E
50|$|A nobleman named Kim Eun-oh (Lee Joon-gi) {{comes to}} town searching for his mother after hearing a rumor that she is staying at the village of Miryang. He has the special <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> hear, <b>see</b> and touch spirits, but pretends he doesn't because he gets annoyed when they ask for favors.|$|R
50|$|Shannon Aeradio {{establish}} {{radio contact}} with flights within the Shanwick OCA {{by means of}} HF radio. HF can provide global coverage due <b>to</b> its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> reflect (<b>see</b> refraction) off the ionosphere and can span the globe {{in a series of}} skips. VHF coverage however is normally limited to line-of-sight range.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Golden Man" [...] is an 11,600-word {{science fiction}} novella by American writer Philip K. Dick. It was {{received}} by the Scott Meredith Literary Agency on June 24, 1953, and first published in the April 1954 issue of If magazine. The story was illustrated by Kelly Freas in its original publication. The story {{is set in a}} post-apocalyptic future where the existence of potentially powerful mutants has become a reality. The mutants are seen as dangerous and have been hunted to death by human beings for years. A golden-skinned mutant called Cris is captured by the government, which attempts to execute him. However, his appearance and <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> into the future allow him to escape.|$|R

5|$|The game's prologue sees Garrett, the protagonist, {{describing}} his youth as a homeless orphan on the City's streets. He is caught {{while attempting to}} pickpocket a suspicious man who reveals {{himself to be a}} Keeper. Impressed by Garrett's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him, he offers him the chance to join his order. Garrett accepts, but later leaves the order to pursue a life of thievery. Years later, Garrett works as a thief, and is under pressure to join a crime ring. As punishment for his failure to pay a protection fee, he is targeted for assassination by the crime lord Ramirez. Garrett evades the assassins, and robs Ramirez's mansion in retaliation. Following this, he is approached by a woman named Viktoria—the representative of an anonymous client who was impressed by Garrett's theft from Ramirez. He is contracted to steal a sword from Constantine, an eccentric nobleman who recently arrived in the City. After Garrett completes the mission, Viktoria takes him to Constantine, who explains that he hired Garrett to steal his own sword as a test. Constantine offers him a fortune to steal The Eye—a gem kept within a sealed and deserted Hammerite cathedral.|$|E

500|$|Physically, kitsune {{are noted}} for having {{as many as}} nine tails. Generally, {{a greater number of}} tails {{indicates}} an older and more powerful fox; in fact, some folktales say that a fox will only grow additional tails after it has lived 100 years. One, five, seven, and nine tails are the most common numbers in folk stories. When a kitsune gains its ninth tail, its fur becomes white or gold. These [...] gain the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and hear anything happening anywhere in the world. Other tales credit them with infinite wisdom (omniscience). After reaching 1,000 years of age and gaining its ninth tail, a kitsune turns a golden color, becoming a , the most powerful form of the kitsune, and then ascends to the heavens.|$|R
