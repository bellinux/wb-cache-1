6000|$|... "For its {{introduction}} into common use {{for purposes of}} <b>aerostation,</b> we are indebted to Mr. Charles Green. Up to his discovery, the process of inflation was not only exceedingly expensive, but uncertain. Two, and even three days, have frequently been wasted in futile attempts to procure a sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon, from which it had great tendency to escape, owing to its extreme subtlety, and its affinity for the surrounding atmosphere. In a balloon sufficiently perfect to retain its contents of coal-gas unaltered, in quantity or amount, for six months, an equal quantity of hydrogen could not be maintained in equal purity for six weeks.|$|E
60|$|There was, in fact, {{an air of}} {{pleasing}} domesticity diffused {{over the}} whole circus. This was, perhaps, partly an effect from our extreme proximity to its performances; I had never been on quite such intimate terms with equitation and <b>aerostation</b> of all kinds; but I think it was also largely from the good hearts of the whole company. A circus must become, during the season, a great brotherhood and sisterhood, especially sisterhood, and its members must forget finally {{that they are not}} united by ties of blood. I dare say they often become so, as husbands and wives and fathers and mothers, if not as brothers.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{supporting}} power being {{estimated at}} 2500 pounds, {{and the united}} weights of the party amounting only to about 1200, there was left a surplus of 1300, of which again 1200 was exhausted by ballast, arranged in bags of different sizes, with their respective weights marked upon them--by cordage, barometers, telescopes, barrels containing provision for a fortnight, water-casks, cloaks, carpet-bags, and various other indispensable matters, including a coffee-warmer, contrived for warming coffee by means of slack-lime, so as to dispense altogether with fire, if it should be judged prudent to do so. All these articles, {{with the exception of}} the ballast, and a few trifles, were suspended from the hoop overhead. The car is much smaller and lighter, in proportion, than the one appended to the model. It is formed of a light wicker, and is wonderfully strong, for so frail looking a machine. Its rim is about four feet deep. The rudder is also very much larger, in proportion, than that of the model; and the screw is considerably smaller. The balloon is furnished besides with a grapnel, and a guide-rope; which latter is of the most indispensable importance. A few words, in explanation, will here be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the details of <b>aerostation.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "So well satisfied, however, was Mr. Mason of the {{ultimate}} success of his invention, that he determined to construct immediately, if possible, a balloon of sufficient capacity to test the question by a voyage of some extent--the original design being to cross the British Channel, as before, in the Nassau balloon. To carry out his views, he solicited and obtained the patronage of Sir Everard Bringhurst and Mr. Osborne, two gentlemen well known for scientific acquirement, and especially for the interest they have exhibited in the progress of <b>ærostation.</b> The project, at the desire of Mr. Osborne, was kept a profound secret from the public--the only persons entrusted with the design being those actually engaged {{in the construction of}} the machine, which was built (under the superintendence of Mr. Mason, Mr. Holland, Sir Everard Bringhurst, and Mr. Osborne,) at the seat of the latter gentleman near Penstruthal, in Wales. Mr. Henson, accompanied by his friend Mr. Ainsworth, was admitted to a private view of the balloon, on Saturday last--when the two gentlemen made final arrangements to be included in the adventure. We are not informed for what reason the two seamen were also included in the party--but, in the course of a day or two, we shall put our readers in possession of the minutest particulars respecting this extraordinary voyage.|$|E

50|$|The Army's Military Aeronautical Service is also finally fully {{organized}} on the 29 June 1918, in {{the scope}} of which the EMA is to be subdivided in separate aviation and <b>aerostation</b> schools and the first Portuguese aircraft factory is established.|$|E
50|$|The decree {{that created}} the Navys Aviation Service in 1917 is {{repealed}} by the Decree 3743 of 5 January 1918. By this new decree, the Navys Aviation Service becomes the Naval Aeronautics Services (Serviços de Aeronáutica Naval). Besides aviation, the Naval Aeronautics (AN) is foreseen to perform also <b>aerostation</b> activities, which however would never been implemented. The AN is regulated by the Decree 3815 of 2 February 1918 and includes the Directory of the Naval Aeronautics Services, the Technical Council of the Naval Aeronautics and the naval air stations (including aviation and <b>aerostation</b> stations). The director of the Naval Aeronautics Services would be a senior naval officer (while no senior officer specialized in aeronautics existed), reporting directly to the Major-General of the Navy (Navy commander).|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{previous}} use of balloons by the Portuguese Army, its first air unit was only created in 1911, in {{the scope of}} the military re-organization that occurred that year.

5000|$|Harris {{invented the}} first {{mechanism}} for emptying a balloon canopy of gas or hot air, thus reducing the drag on landing. He designed a double valve, {{located at the}} top of the balloon bag, with a small valve fitted inside a larger one. One was for releasing the gases slowly, the other quickly. Harris commented that [...] "The science of <b>aerostation</b> has lately fallen into much decay and been the subject of ridicule through the total want of invention".|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1896 as [...] "Mallet, Mélandri et de Pitray" [...] by Maurice Mallet and his associates. In the beginning, the company was {{involved}} in the production of the first hot-air balloons for sport and tourism.In 1909, the company changed its name to become [...] "Zodiac". It then experienced a boom in the construction of airplanes and airships, especially for the <b>Aérostation</b> Maritime (Naval Balloon Command) and through its participation in the war effort. Until the 1930s, 63 airships would leave Zodiac’s workshops.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1908 {{the company}} became [...] "Société française des ballons dirigeables" [...] ("French hot-air balloon company") then in 1911 the company {{changed its name}} to become [...] "Zodiac".

50|$|Finally, the Parliament {{issues the}} Law 162 of 14 May 1914, which creates the Military Aeronautics School (EMA, Escola Militar de Aeronáutica), {{including}} aviation and <b>aerostation</b> services. The EMA {{would include a}} Staff, aeronautical troops (including the <b>Aerostation</b> Company and a Navy Section) and technical and support staff. The Law foresees {{the existence of a}} Military Aeronautical Service from whom the EMA would be dependent. However, while the Aeronautical Service was still not organized, the EMA would be under the inspection of the chairman of the Military Aeronautics Commission. After the formal creation of the EMA, the next steps were to implement it. One of the first steps was to train aviators to serve as the future instructors, with 11 officers being selected for that (nine from the Army and two from the Navy) and sent to several US, French and British aviation schools, where they were certified as aircraft pilots. Other important step was the building of the facilities for the EMA. The study of the Military Aeronautics Commission pointed to Alverca as the best option to install the school, with Vila Nova da Rainha (a village of the Azambuja Municipality) as the second best option. Both places obeyed to the requests of being located in flat grounds (allowing the installation of airfield and hangars), in the riverside (allowing the operation of seaplanes) and near the railway (facilitating the communications). Due to budget restraints, the second option was chosen, with the construction of the EMA installations starting at Vila Nova da Rainha on the 15 April 1915.|$|E
50|$|In 1912, the Portuguese Government {{receives}} {{its first}} airplane, a Deperdussin B, {{offered by the}} Portuguese-born Colonel Albino Costa of the Brazilian Army. The Government further receives a Maurice Farman MF4 offered by the O Comércio do Porto newspaper and an Avro 500 offered by the Portuguese Republican Party. These aircraft would be integrated in the <b>Aerostation</b> Company, but remained years without use because of the inexistence of pilots.Still in 1912, midshipman Miguel Freitas Homem of the naval purser branch applied for admission to any course that would qualify him as an aviator. He was so the first so {{the first member of}} the Portuguese Military to formally request to be an aircraft pilot.|$|E
50|$|Nicolas-Jacques Conté was, {{together}} {{with several other}} scientists, in charge of these military and scientific experiments at Meudon, where {{he was given the}} direction of the <b>aerostation</b> school which was established there. Conté had under his orders a confused gathering of young men in all professions, without any dye of chemistry, drawing, or mathematics, who were called upon to create an entirely new technique. Conté had to approach the elements of the different sciences, for this new teaching had to embrace everything: chemistry, physics, mechanics. Conte, by giving both theoretical and practical lessons, Conté had the models he gave, the instruments he imagined, executed by the hands of his pupils, spending his nights preparing drawings for his lessons, Experiences, sometimes dangerous.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1914, Groslier {{returned}} to France to {{enlist in the}} French army; the war began only weeks later. In 1915, Groslier was assigned {{to serve as a}} balloonist at Versailles <b>Aerostation.</b> Observation balloons were vital to the war effort as a means of aerial reconnaissance, and as these vehicles, for that reason, were favored targets for enemy fire, it was dangerous work. The French media at that time were encouraging French women to become pen pals with soldiers as a way of boosting morale. A relationship developed between Groslier and a pen pal named Suzanne Cecile Poujade, resulting in their marriage in Paris on May 27, 1916. (During this brief break from service, he arranged the publication of his second book on Cambodia.) ...|$|E
50|$|Eventually, as the {{missions}} of the Corps grew more diversified, additional titles {{were used by}} combat engineers, such as Conductor (sapeur-conducteur) in 1810, entrusted with the logistics of the Corps, Firefighter (sapeur-pompier) in 1810 or telegraph sapper (sapeur-télégraphiste). In 1814, the companies of miners were integrated into the sapper battalions, themselves organized in Engineers Regiments (régiments du génie). In 1875, the distinction between miners and sappers was abolished and {{all members of the}} Corps of Engineers were titled sappers-miners, though only sapper was used in common usage. In 1894, the pontonniers or bridgemakers were transferred from the Artillery Corps to the Engineers, thus creating the title sapeurs-pontonniers. In 1909, the Engineering Arm of the Army Staff was entrusted the burgeoning Air Service (<b>Aérostation</b> militaire), its personal was titled sapper-airman (sapeur-aérostier). The titled was disused in 1914 when the Air Service took its independence from the Engineering Arm.|$|E
50|$|In 1924, {{the fighters}} of the GEAR are {{transferred}} to the EMAD at Tancos, which becomes the No 1 Fighter Flight in 1926 and then the Independent Group of Protection and Combat Aviation (GIAPC) in 1927. In 1927, the GEAR is disbanded and gives origin to two separate units, the Information Aviation Group (GAI) and the Independent Bombardment Aviation Group (GIAB), this being transferred to Alverca.By the Decree 11279 of 26 April 1926, the Military Aeronautics School is again divided in separate aviation and <b>aerostation</b> schools. With this reorganization, the Military Aviation School starts to include training programs for non-officers military pilots and for civil pilots. It becomes so the first civil aviation school in Portugal. In 1925, Carlos Bleck would graduate from this School, becoming the first civil pilot to receive its brevet in Portugal. In 1928, Maria de Lourdes Sá Teixeira would also graduate in the Military Aviation School, becoming the first Portuguese woman pilot.|$|E
5000|$|The Balloon Fiesta {{began in}} 1972 as the {{highlight}} of a 50th birthday celebration for 770 KOB Radio. Radio station manager Dick McKee asked Sid Cutter, owner of Cutter Flying Service and {{the first person to}} own a hot air balloon in New Mexico, if KOB could use his new hot-air balloon as part of the festivities. The two began discussing ballooning, along with conversation and help from Oscar Kratz, and McKee asked what the largest gathering of hot air balloons to date had been. 19 balloons in England, Cutter replied. Kratz asked [...] "Can we get 19 here?" [...] Cutter agreed to try. He got commitments from 21 pilots, but bad weather kept some of them from arriving in time. The first fiesta ended up as a gathering of 13 balloons on April 8, 1972, sponsored by KOB. The first event was located {{in the parking lot of}} the Coronado Center Shopping Mall with 20,000 spectators and with balloonists from Arizona, California, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada and Texas taking part. McKee, Cutter, and Kratz are the three men who had originally started the balloon races. The first fiesta incorporated a [...] "Roadrunner-Coyote Balloon Race" [...] (a [...] "hare-and-hounds" [...] race elsewhere in the world) with 1 balloon being the [...] "Roadrunner" [...] and the others being [...] "Coyote" [...] balloons (the [...] "Roadrunner" [...] balloon was actually emblazoned with likenesses of both Warner Bros. characters). The winner of the race - the [...] "Coyote" [...] that landed closest to the Roadrunner - was Don Piccard of the noted <b>aerostation</b> dynasty, flying a balloon of his company's design and construction (his wife also placed in the race). This race has continued as part of the Balloon Fiesta today.|$|E
5000|$|The preface is in vol. 1 but was dated 1797, so it {{apparently}} was sent {{with the title}} pages to bookbinders that year. It was written by Gleig, which names the authors {{of some of the}} longer articles. In it, Gleig states, [...] "Aerology, <b>Aerostation,</b> Chemistry, Electricity, Gunnery, Hydrostatics, Mechanics, with most of the separate articles in the various branches of natural history, we have reason to believe were compiled by Mr. James Tytler, chemist; a man who, though his conduct has been marked by almost perpetual imprudence, possesses no common share of science and genius." [...] Tytler's contributions stop in fact at the letter M. Tytler's very long article in the second edition on Medicine, [...] "was revised and improved for the present by Andrew Duncan, M.D., fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and Professor of the Institutes of Physic in the University." [...] He also states that Motion was written by himself and Tytler.The list of authors goes on, [...] "Mary Queen of Scots, Instinct, Love, Metaphysics, Miracle, Moral Philosophy, Oath, Passion, Plastic Nature, Polytheism, Prayer, Slavery, and Supper of the Lord were contributed by Gleig, editor of the last 6 volumes."

5000|$|In 1862 the British Association for the Advancement of Science {{determined}} to make investigations of the upper atmosphere using balloons. Dr James Glaisher, FRS. was chosen {{to carry out the}} experiments, and at the suggestion of Charles Green Coxwell was employed to fly the balloons.Coxwell constructed a [...] capacity balloon named the Mammoth, and on 5 September 1862, taking off from Wolverhampton, Coxwell and Glaisher reached the greatest height achieved to date. Glaisher lost consciousness during the ascent, his last barometer reading indicating an altitude of 29000 ft and Coxwell lost all sensation in his hands, but managed just in time to pull the valve-cord with his teeth. The balloon dropped nineteen thousand feet in fifteen minutes, landing safely made near Ludlow. Later calculations estimated that their maximum altitude at 35000 to 37000 ft In 1863 Coxwell made a demonstration of ballooning to the Army at Aldershot. These had little practical outcome, although later the War Office did order a balloon from Coxwell with the intention of shipping it to Ghana for use in the Third Anglo-Ashanti War. However, the practicalities of supplying hydrogen under field conditions resulted in the cancellation of the project. In 1863, in company with Henry Negretti, he made the first aerial trip in England for purposes of photography. In 1864-5, in the Research, he made some very successful ascents in Ireland, and gave some lectures upon <b>aerostation.</b> When the Franco-Prussian war broke out in 1870 he went to manage some war-balloons for the Germans. He formed two companies, two officers, and forty-two men, at Cologne, and his assistant went on to Strasbourg, but the town surrendered before much service was rendered. On 17 June 1885, he made his last ascent in a large balloon, the City of York. He had made an annual display at York for several years, and there he bade farewell to a profession of which he {{had been one of the}} most daring exponents for over forty years. His immunity from serious accidents was due to his instinctive prudence, but still more to his thorough knowledge of ballooning tackle.|$|E

És segueix amb certes dades de la I Guerra Mundial, tractats i els inicis de les línies aèries. La creació de l’aeròdrom de la Volateria on operen Pujol Comabella i Cia amb escola i on és provaven els avions construïts als Tallers al barri de Sant Martí, Barcelona. L’empresa és seguida per Talleres Hereter amb les mateixes funcions fins al 1920 en què fan fallida. En aquest moment s’hi insta-la l’Escola de l’Aeronàutica Naval operant amb avions i aeròstats explicant el que si fa fins a 1927. A partir d’aquesta data hi comença a operar Iberia, el 1929 seguirà Compañía de Líneas Aéreas Subvencioandas S. A. i el 1932 Líneas Aéreas Postales Españolas que opera fins al començament de la Guerra Civil espanyola. A partir de gener de 1928 a la companyia espanyola si afegí l’enllaç de la Luft Hansa/Lufthansa que operà fins juliol de 1936. Al març de 1920 la companyia francesa Latécoère comença a operar en el seu propi camp a poca distancia de la Volateria on havia començat a fer escales fins a la creació de l’aeròdrom propi. A partir de 1927 òpera l’Aéropostale fins que el 1933 la substitueix Air France fins al juliol de 1936. L’aeròdrom de l’Aero Club es crea el 1923 però com que no hi operaren línies aèries no entra en l’estudi. Al port que volen diferents hidroavions fins al 1920 en què si hi insta-la la base d’hidroavions de l’Escola de l’Aeronàutica Naval, junt els Tallers i el Dedalo. S’exposa el recorregut de cada una de les instal·lacions fins al 1927. Abans però el 1922, de juliol a setembre i un mes i escaig el 1923 hi opera l’Aero Marítima Mallorquina i a partir de novembre de 1928 hi comença operar Società Anonima Navegazione Aeri que és substituïda per la Società Aerea Mediterranea el 1934 i aquesta el 1935 seguida per Ala Littoria que operà fins al juliol de 1936. Fins al 1927 s’explica el que succeeix a cada instal·lació i els moviments d’aeronaus, per passar a partir d’aquesta data explicar el desenvolupament de les aerolínies, des de quina ciutat venen i fins on arriben, la qual cosa donà una visió de la importància dels aeròdroms/aeroports de Barcelona. En paral·lel s’ha estudiat el volum de passatgers, càrrega, correu, així com s’ha explicat el que han {{significat}} en aquest procés certs aparells. Per acabar s’ha comparat els aeròdroms/aeroports de Barcelona amb el de Madrid tant en el nombre de línies com en les dades quantificables exposades unes línies enrere. The introduction {{begins with}} the development of the <b>aerostation</b> in Barcelona from 1784 to 1908, the establishment of the first aeronautic club, the first flight to the Catalan capital and all other flights made up to 1914. It then follows on with data from the First World War, treaties and the advent of airlines. The Volateria aerodrome was established, from where Pujol Comabella & Co. would operate with a training school and where tests were carried out on the planes made in their own workshops would be tested, in the Sant Martí district of Barcelona. The company was replaced by Talleres Hereter, which carried out the same functions until 1920, when the firm collapsed. At that point, the Escola de l’Aeronàutica Naval (Naval Aeronautics School) installed itself at the Volateria, operating aeroplanes and aerostats; its activities up to 1927 are detailed. From that year onwards, Iberia began its operations in the aerodrome. 1929 saw the arrival of the Compañía de Líneas Aéreas Subvencionadas S. A. (The Subsidised Airline Company Ltd.) with Líneas Aéreas Postales Españolas (The Spanish Postal Airlines) following in 1932. This latter company would operate until the start of the Spanish Civil War. From January 1928, the Spanish company would be joined by the link with Luft Hansa (styled ‘Lufthansa’ from 1933), which operated until July 1936. In March 1920, the French company Latécoère began to make stop-overs at its own airfield located close to Volateria, where it had initially begun its stop-overs before the finalisation of its own field. Aéropostale would follow, from 1927 until, in 1933, it was substituted by Air France, which operated there until 1936. The Aero Club aerodrome was set up in 1923; however, as no airlines operated from here, it does not form a part of this current study. Up to 1920, various seaplanes used Barcelona port; the Escola de l’Aeronàutica Naval installed its seaplane base here, together with those of Tallers and Dédalo. Each one of the installations is detailed up to 1927. Before this period, however, from July to September 1922 and in 1923 for about six weeks, Aero Marítima Mallorquina (Majorcan Maritime Air) operated here. Additionaly, from November 1928 the Società Anonima Navegazione Aeri (Air Navegation Ltd.) began its operations here; in 1934 it was replaced by Società Aerea Mediterranea (The Mediterranean Air Society), and then—from 1935 —by Ala Littoria (the Italian national airline in the 1930 s and 1940 s), which would operate here until July 1936. Explanation is given for the events and occurrences affecting each one of the installations, and for all aircraft movements, up to 1927. From this date, airline development is described (where the flights originate and where they arrive), which provides an overview of the importance of Barcelona’s aerodromes/airports. In parallel, the volume of passengers, cargo and mail is studied, and explanation is provided for the significance within this process of specific apparatus. Finally, the Barcelona aerodromes/airports are compared with that of Madrid both with respect to the number of airlines and as regards the quantifiable data set out above...|$|E
