5|$|The firebed (grate) <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> dampers had {{not been}} built to the drawings; they were too small, {{resulting}} in poor air supply and inefficient combustion.|$|E
5|$|The SABRE engine design aims {{to avoid}} the {{historic}} weight-performance issue by {{using some of the}} liquid hydrogen fuel to cool helium within a closed-cycle precooler, which quickly reduces the temperature of the air at the inlet. The air is then used for combustion in a similar manner to a conventional jet engine; once the helium has left the pre-cooler, it is further heated by the products of the pre-burner, giving it enough energy to drive the turbine and the liquid hydrogen pump. As a consequence of the air being cooled at all speeds, the jet can be built of light alloys and the weight is roughly halved. Additionally, more fuel can be burnt at high speeds. Beyond Mach5.5, the air would normally become unusably hot despite the cooling; accordingly, the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> is closed upon attaining this speed and the engine instead is solely fed via on-board liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel, as in a traditional rocket.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{red brick}} {{building}} with patent Victoria stone dressings surrounded by a verandah of iron columns. In 1904 all the windows had Venetian blinds, and all the rooms were ventilated by Boyle's fresh <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> ventilators. There were gas brackets in every room.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, {{diffusers}} {{are mostly}} used in reverse fashion, as <b>air</b> <b>inlets</b> or returns. This {{is especially true}} for Linear slot diffuser and 'perf' diffusers. But more commonly, grilles are used as return or exhaust <b>air</b> <b>inlets.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Autobleu’s body {{incorporated}} several futuristic styling cues including {{far less}} discrete <b>air</b> <b>inlets</b> {{ahead of the}} rear wheel arches than were featured on the Renault 4 CV. These resembled the equivalent <b>air</b> <b>inlets</b> that would be adapted by Renault themselves for their new Dauphine model when launched in 1956.|$|R
25|$|Blow-out — Water {{droplets}} {{blown out}} of the cooling tower by wind, generally at the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> openings. Water may also be lost, {{in the absence of}} wind, through splashing or misting. Devices such as wind screens, louvers, splash deflectors and water diverters are used to limit these losses.|$|E
25|$|The new fighter {{may have}} a {{significantly}} longer fuselage than other fifth generation fighter designs, such as the F-22, for reduction of transonic and supersonic drag. A trapezoidal wing may be implemented for reduction of drag and radar signature. Use of an 's'-shaped <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and boundary layer separation system would greatly reduce radar signature.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} the new powerplant on the Mirage III's airframe, and to deliver the added cooling required by the J79, the aircraft's rear fuselage was slightly shortened and widened, its air intakes were enlarged, and a large <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> was installed {{at the base of}} the vertical stabilizer, so as to supply the extra cooling needed for the afterburner. The engine itself was encased in a titanium heatshield.|$|E

25|$|Guidance {{was planned}} to be {{provided}} during mid-course flight by an inertial navigation system, while terminal guidance would use a dual-mode seeker. Propulsion would be provided by an integrated rocket-ramjet, which would act as a solid-fuel rocket during boost, with the rocket's casing, following exhaustion of its propellant and the ejection of the rocket nozzle and a fairing covering an <b>air</b> <b>inlet,</b> becoming a combustion chamber for an air-breathing ramjet, which was planned to use Shelldyne-H fuel. The missile {{was expected to be}} carried by the B-1 bomber, or alternatively by a developed version of the FB-111.|$|E
25|$|The cockpit {{design of}} the TBM strives to be {{user-friendly}} and as uncomplicated to operate as possible. For pilot convenience, an automatic fuel selector automatically switches between fuel tanks periodically to effortlessly maintain fuel balance throughout flight; manual selection of fuel tanks is also possible, which remains overseen by a low fuel warning system. The ice protection system is as automated as possible, the windshield being electrically heated, the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> being kept warm by engine exhaust and the de-ice boots automatically cycling once activated. The electrically actuated flaps are monitored by a sophisticated split-flap protection system to prevent asymmetric deployment. An onboard air data computer calculates various values to support the pilot, such as the aircraft's true air speed, wind, and power advisory notices based upon current external temperature and altitude.|$|E
25|$|The K200 {{series of}} {{vehicles}} transport mechanized infantry platoon {{is designed to}} keep personnel safe from small arms fire. The hull of the KIFV is of all-welded aluminium armour with an additional layer of spaced laminate steel armour bolted to it. This composite armour provides {{a higher level of}} protection for less weight. It can protect against 12.7mm on the side and 7.62mm on the rear, and against anti-personnel mines. The engine compartment is located at the front right of the vehicle and is separated from the remainder of the vehicle by a bulkhead. The engine compartment is fitted with a fire extinguishing system that can be operated by the driver or from outside the vehicle.

25|$|In 1963, BAC Warton {{was working}} on the {{preliminary}} design of a two-seat Lightning development with a variable-geometry wing, based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the variable-sweep wing, which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged dorsal fin fairing, an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the Royal Navy's existing aircraft carriers carrier-based aircraft, the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year. Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer Rolls-Royce Spey engine; it is also likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> to the sides or to upper fuselage) to install a larger, more capable radar.|$|E
25|$|The Cell is {{operated}} by initially closing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> {{at the top}} of the downcomer and feeding the flotation pulp in through the nozzle. The air in the downcomer is entrained in the pulp, creating a partial vacuum that draws pulp from the tank up into the downcomer. The pulp level quickly reaches the nozzle, which is at a level above that of the liquid level in the tank. This creates a hydrostatic head in the downcomer, meaning that the pressure inside the top of the downcomer is lower than the atmospheric pressure. When the inlet is opened, air is drawn into the top space of the downcomer by this lower pressure, where it too is entrained into the downcomer contents by the plunging jet. At the same time, a downward flow is established in the pulp in the downcomer that is sufficient to counter the buoyancy of the bubbles, and the aerated pulp discharges into the tank.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} features of the Skylon's design is its powerplant, known as Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine (SABRE). The design of the SABRE engine has drawn heavily upon the STRICT/STERN experimental engines, sharing many features such as the propellant and the adoption of the trialled Expansion Deflection Nozzle, as well as building upon the wider field of liquid air cycle engines (LACE). The engines are designed to operate much like a conventional jet engine to around Mach5.5 (1,700m/s), [...] altitude, beyond which the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> closes and the engine operates as a highly efficient rocket to orbital speed. The proposed SABRE engine is not a scramjet, but a jet engine running combined cycles of a precooled jet engine, rocket engine and ramjet. Originally the key technology for this type of precooled jet engine did not exist, as it required a heat exchanger that was ten times lighter than the state of the art. Research conducted since then has achieved the necessary performance.|$|E

500|$|The AJ-1 was a three-seat, high-wing {{monoplane}} with tricycle landing gear. To facilitate carrier operations, {{the outer}} wing panels and the tailfin could be manually folded.
