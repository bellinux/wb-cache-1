40|$|Abstract Background Fresh coconut (Cocos nucifera L) {{water is}} a clear, sterile, colourless, {{slightly}} <b>acidic</b> and naturally <b>flavoured</b> drink, mostly consumed in tropical areas. It is {{a rich source of}} nutrients and has been used for medical purposes. This study was designed to investigate changes in selected characteristics of coconut water after autoclaving, gamma irradiation and storage. Also, the study was designed for assessing the possibility of measuring the growth of bacterial in fresh, stored or sterilised coconut water using turbidity measurements (at wavelengths between 600 nm and 800 nm) or by dry biomass determinations. Results Portions of coconut water aseptically extracted from the matured fruit, (average pH of 6. 33 ± 0. 17) were either stored at 4 °C, autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min., or irradiated with gamma rays at 5 kGy. Subsequent changes in selected characteristics were determined. Autoclaving, gamma irradiation and long term storage of coconut water at 4 °C resulted both {{in the development of a}} pale to intense yellow colour and changes in turbidity. After storage, the dry matter content of fresh, autoclaved and irradiated coconut water by 52. 0 %, 23. 5 % and 5. 0 % respectively. There were also significant differences in the UV spectra before and after sterilisation and during the storage of the coconut water. Although changes in total carbohydrates were observed, they were not significant (p > 0. 05). Conclusions The enormous differences in the characteristics before and after storage suggests that the use of turbidity and dry biomass measurements for measuring the growth of bacteria in fresh, autoclaved and gamma irradiated coconut water before storage is practicable without any possibility of interference by the innate turbidity, colour and dry matter of the coconut water. However, this is not practicable after storing the coconut waters at 4 °C, since there were increases in the turbidity and dry matter of the coconut water to levels that will mask the turbidity of a growing bacteria culture. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Msc Food Sc (Food Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Kefir is a {{traditional}} fermented milk that is carbonated, has a sharp <b>acidic</b> taste, yeasty <b>flavour</b> and contains a low percentage alcohol (less than 2 % (v/v)). The beverage is manufactured by fermenting milk with Kefir grains, comprised of microorganisms, polysaccharides and milk proteins. The microbial population of Kefir grains primarily include lactic acid bacteria (LAB), namely lactococci and lactobacilli, yeasts, Acetobacter and filamentous fungi. Kefir exhibits antimicrobial activity in vitro against some fungi, and Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria. Although the exact cause of this inhibition in Kefir is not known, the ability of LAB to inhibit the growth of closely related bacteria is well known. This inhibition of pathogenic and spoilage microbes {{may be due to}} the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, acetaldehyde, diacetyl, carbon dioxide or bacteriocins. Acid is not the only contributor to the antimicrobial activity of Kefir and Kefir grains, and bacteriocins may play a role in the inhibitory activity. The bacteriocin producer Lactobacillus plantarum ST 8 KF, isolated from Kefir and Kefir grains, produces a bacteriocin 3. 5 kDa in size. The mode of activity of bacteriocin ST 8 KF (bacST 8 KF) is thought to be bacteriostatic in exponential cultures of Enterococcus faecalis E 88, Lactobacillus casei LHS, Lactobacillus curvatus DF 38, Lactobacillus sakei DSM 20017, Lactobacillus salivarius 241 and Listeria innocua F and LMG 13568. The peptide is sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and does not adsorb to the surface of the producer cell. The bacteriocin is stable between pH 2. 0 and 10. 0, and for 20 min at 121 °C. Maximum bacteriocin activity was observed in modified MRS medium supplemented with glucose or saccharose, meat extract, KH 2 PO 4, glycerol, thiamine or cyanocobalamin, or in modified MRS medium without tri-ammonium citrate. Maximum levels of adsorption of bacST 8 KF (80 %) to Lb. casei LHS and Lb. sakei DSM 20017 were recorded. Adsorption (80 %) of the bacteriocin to Lactobacillus paraplantarum ATCC 700211 T and Streptococcus caprinus ATCC 700066, which are not sensitive to the bacteriocin was also recorded. Optimal adsorption to E. faecalis E 88 was recorded at 25 °C at pH 2. 0, and to L. innocua LMG 13568 at 4 °C, 10 °C and 25 °C at pH 6. 0. Potassium ions, MgCl 2, Tris, NH 4 - citrate, Na-acetate, Na 2 CO 3, EDTA and SDS led to decreased adsorption to both sensitive strains, while NaCl and mercaptoethanol resulted decreased adsorption to E. faecalis E 88, but not to L. innocua LMG 13568. Methanol resulted in lower levels of adsorption to L. innocua LMG 13568 but not to E. faecalis E 88. Triton X- 100 and Triton X- 114 increased the adsorption of bacST 8 KF by 40 %, and ethanol and chloroform had no effect on bacteriocin adsorption. The growth of Lb. plantarum ST 8 KF and L. innocua LMG 13568 in a mixed culture resulted in an increase of bacST 8 KF production. Cells treated with bacST 8 KF secreted DNA and galactosidase. As bacST 8 KF remains stable under a variety of conditions, the bacteriocin may have application, if awarded GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status, in various food products as a natural additive or preservative. The genes encoding bacteriocin production are located on a 3. 9 kilo base (kb) plasmid. Curing of the plasmid resulted in a mutant strain of Lb. plantarum ST 8 KF, and the Lb. plantarum strains ST 8 KF(+) and ST 8 KF(-) differed with regards to antibiotic resistance and carbohydrate fermentation reactions. The wild type and the cured strain were incorporated into Kefir grains during mass cultivation. The survival of the bacST 8 KF sensitive Enterococcus mundtii ST 4 SA added to the milk during Kefir production using the enriched mass cultured grains was monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Enterococcus mundtii ST 4 SA was present in higher numbers in the ST 8 KF(-) Kefir system when compared to the ST 8 KF(+) system. It can, therefore, be concluded that Lb. plantarum ST 8 KF(+) contributes to the antimicrobial activity of Kefir through the production of bacteriocin ST 8 KF...|$|R

Additionally, its flavor is dependent on that of the fresh garlic that was used to make it. Garlic with a higher sugar content produces a milder, more caramel-like flavor, whereas garlic with a low sugar content produces a sharper, somewhat <b>acidic</b> <b>flavour,</b> similar in character to tomato paste. Burnt flavors may also be present if the garlic was heated for too long or kept at too high a temperature.|$|E
50|$|The fruits when ripe on {{the plant}} bear a {{resemblance}} to coffee berries, and ripen in mid- to late summer. The fruit is edible (mainly consumed in Eastern Europe, UK, and Iran), but the unripe fruit is astringent. The fruit only fully ripens after it falls from the tree. When ripe, the fruit is dark ruby red or a bright yellow. It has an <b>acidic</b> <b>flavour</b> which is best described as a mixture of cranberry and sour cherry; it is mainly used for making jam, makes an excellent sauce similar to cranberry sauce when pitted and then boiled with sugar and orange, but also can be eaten dried. In Azerbaijan and Armenia, the fruit is used for distilling vodka, in Austria and German Alps is used for distilling Dirndlbrand, in Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina it is distilled into raki, and in Greece crana berries are used to make home-made liqueur. In Turkey and Iran it is eaten with salt as a snack in summer, and traditionally drunk in a cold drink called kızılcık şerbeti. Cultivars selected for fruit production in Ukraine have fruit up to four cm long. It is eaten in Eastern Europe in many ways including as a medicine. It is very high in vitamin C and is used to fight colds and flus.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to check the}} protagonist possessions of thermophilic bacteria in defect development under prolonged incubation of packed milk pouches at 55 oC temperature for 36 hours. Total thermophilic count, Total Mesophilic count, Coliform, Yeast and Mold along with MBRT tests were conducted at the time interval of on hour. The bell shaped graphical growth pattern was examined for the parameters including total thermophilic count and total mesophilic count. The counts initially increased up to 25 hours and gradually reduced {{at the end of}} 36 hours. Total viable cells also affect MBRT time resulting in to “U ” shapedgraphical pattern examined for the MBRT test. Coliforms were not detected in initial hours but examined its presence in mid hours between 6 th to 20 th hours, which were gradually reduced and vanished due to accumulation of acid and gas resulting in to imbalance of pH. It was also observed that fungi did not tolerate 55 oC temperature and disappeared gradually due to lack of adaptation resulting in to impotent to cultivate at 55 oC temperature after 5 hours. Pure, partial or combined influence of total microbial activity at 55 oC temperature in pasteurized milk leads to development of numerous sensory defects including <b>acidic</b> <b>flavour,</b> bitter taste, inexpressive and unpleasant flavour along with physical defects like gassy curd formatio...|$|E
40|$|The high {{potential}} of health beneficial polyphenols and antioxidants in cocoa beans {{has been a}} major topic for research in recent years. The large-scale application of cocoa beans for health beneficial compounds is relatively unexplored {{and it needs to be}} widely utilized by pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries. Processing methods such as fermentation and drying are major deterrents for recovering high polyphenols in cocoa beans. Hence, it was the intention of this work to introduce the application of hot water blanching pre-treatment and various drying methods for producing polyphenols rich cocoa beans by using unfermented beans. The studies incorporated the application of various drying methods such as oven, adsorption, vacuum, freeze and sun drying methods on cocoa beans. The studies compared the ability of these drying methods to preserve the bioactive capacities namely, total polyphenolic contents and antioxidants activity after hot water blanching. The potential of adsorption, vacuum and freeze drying methods for recovering high polyphenols content are useful in comparing it with the conventional cocoa drying methods such as oven and sun drying methods. For the studies on oven drying of cocoa beans, the drying parameters (T= 60 °C, 70 °C and 80 °C) used were similar to the conventional hot air drying parameters used in industries. The total polyphenolic contents of fermented cocoa beans dried at 70 °C was found to be the highest. The polyphenols degradation kinetics for oven drying method of cocoa beans was determined using first-order reaction kinetics model based on various drying temperatures and durations of drying. The studies on drying kinetics of fresh cocoa beans dried using oven, vacuum, adsorption and sun drying methods were successfully analysed. It was found that adsorption drying and vacuum drying methods dried cocoa beans faster than oven and sun drying methods. Two respective falling rate periods were recorded by adsorption and vacuum drying. The effective diffusivities were determined and were found to be in accordance to that of published literatures. Hot water blanching pre-treatment were performed for fresh and fermented cocoa beans (whole beans and half cut). Blanching pre-treatment method was found to show significantly higher total polyphenolic contents when compared with unblanched cocoa samples. The optimal blanching parameter (90 °C for 5 min) obtained for fresh beans were subsequently used for experiments involving fresh cocoa beans. The total polyphenolic contents and antioxidant activity of blanched and unblanched cocoa beans were analysed. Results showed that both adsorption and vacuum drying methods showed high recovery of polyphenolic compounds and antioxidants on comparison with freeze dried cocoa samples, which was used as a benchmark in quality analysis of food products. High polyphenols contents were achieved after the blanching and drying treatments and were noted to be significantly higher on comparison with published literatures. Sensory analysis of both blanched and unblanched cocoa beans were analysed after drying using various drying methods. The results for unfermented cocoa beans showed high astringency flavour attributes which further confirmed the high contents of polyphenols in cocoa beans. The cocoa and <b>acidic</b> <b>flavour</b> attributes were recorded to be less owing to the unfermented nature of cocoa beans. The results obtained provides a gateway towards the use of advanced drying technology in cocoa industry. The potential of blanching pre-treatment to mediate high recovery of cocoa polyphenols after drying has been proven through this work. The processing methods used in the current study can be implemented in on-farm cocoa processing, making it a more sustainable farming option...|$|E
