The measurements of concentration of radon and its progeny, <b>air</b> <b>conductivity</b> and aerosol size distribution made at Pune, India, have been analyzed.

40|$|Prediction and {{modeling}} of localized flow processes in macropores is of crucial importance for sustaining both {{soil and water}} quality. However, currently there are no reliable means to predict preferential flow due to its inherently large spatial variability. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the predictive performance of previously developed empirical models for both water and air flow and to explore the potential applicability of X-ray computed tomography (CT) -derived macropore network characteristics. For this purpose, 65 cylindrical soil columns (6  cm diameter and 3. 5  cm height) were extracted from the topsoil (5  cm to 8. 5  cm depth) in a 15  m [*]×[*]  15  m grid from an agricultural field located in Silstrup, Denmark. All soil columns were scanned with an industrial X-ray CT scanner (129  µm resolution) and later employed for measurement of saturated hydraulic <b>conductivity,</b> <b>air</b> permeability at − 30 and − 100  cm matric potential, and gas diffusivity at − 30 and − 100  cm matric potential. Distribution maps for saturated hydraulic <b>conductivity,</b> <b>air</b> permeability, and gas diffusivity reflected no autocorrelation irrespective of soil texture and organic matter content. Existing empirical predictive models for saturated hydraulic <b>conductivity</b> and <b>air</b> permeability showed poor performance, as they were not able to realistically capture macropore flow. The tested empirical model for gas diffusivity predicted measurements at − 100  cm matric potential reasonably well, but failed at − 30  cm matric potential, particularly for soil columns with biopore-dominated flow. X-ray CT-derived macroporosity matched the measured air-filled porosity at − 30  cm matric potential well. Many of the CT-derived macropore network characteristics were strongly interrelated. Most of the macropore network characteristics were also significantly correlated with saturated hydraulic <b>conductivity,</b> <b>air</b> permeability, and gas diffusivity. The predictive Ahuja et al.  (1984) model for saturated hydraulic <b>conductivity,</b> <b>air</b> permeability, and gas diffusivity performed reasonably well when parameterized with novel, X-ray CT-derived parameters such as effective percolating macroporosity for biopore-dominated flow and total macroporosity for matrix-dominated flow. The obtained results further indicate that it is crucially important to discern between matrix-dominated and biopore-dominated flow for accurate prediction of macropore flow from X-ray CT-derived macropore network characteristics...|$|R

Both samples showed conductivities of approximate to 10 S cm(- 1) at 900 degrees C and were also shown to be stable at this temperature in N- 2. For YSr 2 Cu 2 FeO 7 +x, semiconducting behaviour was observed up to approximate to 550 degrees C, with a decrease in conductivity at higher temperatures, attributed to oxygen loss reducing the charge carrier concentration. In the case of YSr 2 Cu 2 CoO 7 +y, semiconducting behaviour was observed over the range of temperatures studied, although a small but significant steep increase in conductivity was observed above 800 degrees C. High temperature X-ray diffraction studies of this particular phase showed that this increase in conductivity coincided with an orthorhombic-tetragonal structural transition, accompanied by a significant reduction in cell volume. In addition to measurements in <b>air,</b> <b>conductivities</b> were also measured with varying p(O- 2) (0. 2 - 10 (- 5) atm) at 900 degrees C, and these data showed significant hysteresis between measurements on reducing and re-oxidising, suggesting poor oxide ion transport, poor oxygen surface exchange kinetics, or significant structural changes on varying p(O- 2). Chemical compatibility studies of these phases with SOFC electrolytes at temperatures between 900 and 1000 degrees C showed reaction in all cases. In the case of CeO 2 based electrolytes, the reaction {{led to the formation of}} the "fluorite-block'' phases, (Y/Ce) (2) Sr 2 Cu 3 -xMxO 9 +y (M = Co, Fe), and samples of these were subsequently prepared and the conductivities measured.

Soil organic carbon content, aggregate stability, saturated hydraulic <b>conductivity,</b> <b>air</b> permeability, root length density and rooting depth were all less under ryegrass than kikuyu pasture. There was, however, no consistent effect of pasture-type on pore size distribution or penetrometer resistance. Differences in penetrometer resistance were most obvious in the 10 - 30 cm layer with subsurface compaction being evident at some sites under both types of pasture. This was attributed to the treading effects of grazing cattle plus formation of a compacted layer at the depth of tillage under ryegrass pastures. Subsoil tillage of a ryegrass pasture resulted in a substantial reduction in penetrometer resistance in the compacted 10 - 20 cm layer and increases in hydraulic <b>conductivity,</b> <b>air</b> permeability, root length density and rooting depth.

During all five ascents the air-earth current density did not change with altitude. For pure maritime air-conditions, the mean air-earth current density was found to be 2. 9 pA/m** 2. The mean hourly air-earth current density over the Atlantic shows nearly the same 24 -hour pattern as measured by Cobb (1977) at the South Pole at the same time.

The area where this event occurred had been monitored since November 2005 by a QuakeFinder magnetometer site, unit 609, 2 km from the epicenter.

This station included an ultra low frequency (ULF) 3 -axis induction magnetometer, a simple <b>air</b> <b>conductivity</b> sensor to measure relative airborne ion concentrations, and a geophone to identify {{the arrival of the}} P-wave from an earthquake. Similar in frequency content to the increased ULF activity reported two weeks prior to the Loma Prieta M 7. 0 quake in 1989 (Fraser-Smith, 1990, 1991), the QF station detected activity in the 0. 01 – 12 Hz bands, but it consisted of an increasing number of short duration (1 to 30 s duration) pulsations. The pulsations peaked around 13 days prior to the event. The amplitudes of the pulses were strong, (3 – 20 nT), compared to the average ambient noise at the site, (10 – 250 pT), which included a component arising from the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) operations. The QF station also detected different pulse shapes, e. g. negative or positive only polarity, with some pulses including a combination of positive and negative.

We could not find a data set with pre-earthquake radon measurements taken near the Alum Rock epicenter to compare against our field data.

The objectives {{of this study}} were to evaluate, using static and dynamic soil attributes, the influence of no-till sowing operation on creating better physical environment for soybean crop growth. A field transect with clay content ranging from 150 to 400 g kg- 1 was selected in Ponta Grossa, Paraná State, Brazil, from a Typic Hapludox that has been cultivated under no-till system for 16 years. After soybean harvest, 68 undisturbed soil samples were collected at both sowing row and inter-row positions. The following soil properties were evaluated: saturated hydraulic <b>conductivity,</b> <b>air</b> permeability, bulk density, total porosity, soil moisture at field capacity, texture, and total organic carbon. Multiple regressions among dynamic and static soil properties were fitted, and differences between sowing row and inter-rows were tested by paired t test. Saturated hydraulic <b>conductivity</b> and <b>air</b> permeability were positively correlated with macroporosity (r = 0. 75 and 0. 74, respectively; p< 0. 001). Total porosity, bulk density, air permeability, and macroporosity were position-dependent. In general, soil physical quality was higher at row position due to lower bulk density and higher total porosity, hydraulic <b>conductivity,</b> <b>air</b> permeability and macroporosity...|$|R

The corresponding ceramic bulk samples are prepared by solid state reaction. In order to obtain dense BZY 16 and BCZY 10 samples, 1 [*]wt. % ZnO was added before sintering process. As deposited films are amorphous and crystallise under the expected crystal structure at different temperatures (e. g., SZY 16 [*]≈[*] 623 [*]K; BZY 16 [*]≈[*] 423 [*]K; BCY 10 [*]≈[*] 873 [*]K, and BCZY 10 [*]≈[*] 873 [*]K). SZY 16 and BZY 16 coatings are stable in air with respect to carbonation and hydration. BZY 16 coatings require an in situ crystallization {{in order to avoid}} further cracking due to the tensile stress generation associated with the crystallization phenomenon, so they are deposited directly onto hot substrate (Tsubstrate[*]≈[*] 523 [*]K). BCZY 10 amorphous coatings present a good chemical stability against carbonation in air up to 573 [*]K but the coatings decompose in BaCO 3 and CeO 2 mixture after annealing treatment at around 873 [*]K for 2 [*]h in air, instead of the expected double substituted BaCeO 3 perovskite structure. Nevertheless, the crystallization perovskite structure is obtained after annealing treatment under vacuum to prevent the carbonation of the coating. BCY 10 requires in situ crystallisation (Tsubstrate[*]≈[*] 873 [*]K) to obtain BaCeO 3 structure while avoiding the carbonation of the film. All the bulk samples present the perovskite structure with a relative density higher than ∼ 80 % and without trace of ZnO or BaCO 3. Eighty percent of relative density was demonstrated to give a good compromise between porosity and grain boundary blocking effects. The electrical properties of the films and pellets are investigated by AC impedance spectroscopy in <b>air.</b> <b>Conductivities</b> of crystallised coatings are close but always significantly lower than those of ceramic bulk samples of the same composition...|$|R
