40|$|Organizations that {{collect and}} use {{large volumes of}} {{personal}} information are expected under the principle of <b>accountable</b> data <b>governance</b> to take measures to protect data subjects from risks that arise from inapproriate uses of this information. In this paper, we focus on a specific class of mechanisms—audits to identify policy violators coupled with punishments—that organizations such as hospitals, financial institutions, and Web services companies may adopt to protect data subjects from privacy and security risks stemming from inappropriate information use by insiders. We model {{the interaction between the}} organization (defender) and an insider (adversary) during the audit process as a repeated game. We then present an audit strategy for the defender. The strategy requires the defender to commit to its action and when paired with the adversary’s best response to it, provably yields an asymmetric subgame perfect equilibrium. We then present two mechanisms for allocating the total audit budget for inspections across all games the organization plays with different insiders. The first mechanism allocates budget to maximize the utility of the organization. Observing that this mechanism protects the organization’s interests but may not protect data subjects, we introduce an <b>accountable</b> data <b>governance</b> property, which requires the organization to conduct thorough audits and impose punishments on violators. The second mechanism we present achieves this property. We provide evidence that a number of parameters in the game model can be estimated from prior empirical studies and suggest specific studies that can help estimate other parameters. Finally, we use our model to predict observed practices in industry (e. g., differences in punishment rates of doctors and nurses for the same violation) and the effectiveness of policy interventions (e. g., data breach notification laws and government audits) in encouraging organizations to adopt <b>accountable</b> data <b>governance</b> practices...|$|R

40|$|In China, most of {{the service}} {{delivery}} responsibilities are assigned to the subnational governments. Yet for reasons of efficiency in tax collection and administration, the central government collects revenues far in excess of its expenditure needs. In 2003 the central government collected 70 percent of consolidated revenues but accounted for only 30 percent of consolidated expenditures. The initial fiscal surplus {{of the central government}} enables it to use its spending power to provide financing to subnational jurisdictions for the achievement of national objectives and to influence local priorities. This paper examines the incentives associated with the design of such transfers and their implications for the efficiency and equity of public service provision and <b>accountable</b> local <b>governance</b> in China. The paper argues that the existing design of such transfers is not consistent with efficiency and equity considerations. It further undermines local autonomy without enhancing local accountability while creating incentives for imprudent fiscal management. Its main limitations include a complex and opaque system, a piecemeal approach to gap filling, lack of consistency of design with objectives, focus on input controls without regard for output accountability, incentives to support an antiquated management paradigm, a one-size-fits-all approach to local financing, and lack of transparency and regulatory framework for the intergovernmental transfer system. The paper makes specific suggestions on a reform of this systemto overcome these limitations and on better use of fiscal transfers to create responsive, responsible, equitable, and <b>accountable</b> local <b>governance</b> in China.

Political institutions that are <b>accountable,</b> good <b>governance</b> and economic development indeed enable central governments to let minorities share in the gains in wealth and security. The political allegiance of minorities thus acquired is likely to strengthen the process of state building. Conversely, poor governance implies that the state fails to satisfy collective needs and fails as an arbiter in civil conflict. If so, a central government has to rely more on the political and economic coercion of minorities and thus increases the probability of violent escalation of civil conflict. © 2005 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

40|$|D. Ed. This {{research}} focussed on how {{the school}} management team could create in—service training opportunities for school governing bodies because the management team has the finger {{on the pulse of}} the exact needs of the schools. Firstly a literary review was undertaken to determine how school governing bodies are presently functioning. The following findings were deduced: There is a definite need for further training for the school governing bodies of previously disadvantaged schools. Most school governing bodies do not function effectively as a result of uncertainty of their roles and powers, the lack of relevant knowledge and skills as well as the fact {{that a large number of}} the parent body is illiterate. Schools do not create enough training opportunities for their governing bodies. Secondly, an empirical study was undertaken in order to achieve the goal of this research. Structured questionnaire and focus group interviews were used. The above research instruments were based on the perceptions of respondents with regard to effective school governance and in- service training of governing bodies. Three representative groups on the governing body namely parents, teachers and principals were used as respondents. The questionnaire consists of a Section A (biographical details), Section B (<b>accountable</b> school <b>governance)</b> and Section C (school based training). Section B and Section C consist of 16 items each. After a factor analysis of Section B one factor emerged. This factor had a Cronbach-Alpha-reliability coefficient of 0. 955 and was named <b>accountable</b> school <b>governance.</b> Hypotheses based on <b>accountable</b> school <b>governance</b> were stated. The data was analysed and interpreted by comparing the mean scores of: two independent groups; and three or more independent groups. Statistical significant differences between two independent groups were investigated by using Levene's student t-test. Where three or more independent groups were involved, ANOVA (Analysis Of Variance) followed by Dunette T 3 or Scheffe tests were used. Discussions and explanations of the mean scores were provided. The perceptions of the majority of the respondents were that their governing bodies do not execute their duties and responsibilities effectively. The factor analysis of Section C was problematic in that only seven out of sixteen items could be used to form a factor. hi spite of a very low Cronbach-Alpha-reliability coefficient of 0. 592 this factor could be named as school based training. Focus group Tell me how you experienced the training workshops that were organised by the Department of Education? What are your feelings that the school should be involved in the training of school governing bodies? The responses from the interviews indicated that the majority of the respondents were not satisfied with the training workshops that were organised by the Department of Education. The general feeling was that the workshops were very infrequent. It was recommended that training should take place on a continuous basis. This will enable members of governing bodies to develop their potential, which will in turn contribute The respondents were not in favour of the school management team providing training to school governing bodies. They were concerned that the management team would not be as objective as external organisations or institutions. However they were of the opinion that the school is in the best position to solve its own problems. A shadow period for training should be provided where the old office bearers serve as mentors for the newly elected members. This is to ensure stability and continuity of the organisation. In this regard the school management team should plan, control and co-ordinate in-service training programs on a continuous basis...|$|R
