5|$|Greene {{was again}} {{temporarily}} elevated to command of his division, now designated {{part of the}} XII Corps of the Army of the Potomac, at the Battle of Antietam. His division's three brigades were led by junior officers who had survived Cedar Mountain. Even though XII Corps commander Brig. Gen. Joseph K. Mansfield was killed shortly after the fighting began, Greene led a crushing attack against the Confederates near the Dunker Church, achieving the farthest penetration of Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson's lines than any Union unit. Under immense pressure, Greene held his small division (only 1,727 men engaged {{at the start of}} the day) in advance of the rest of the army for four hours, but eventually withdrew after suffering heavy losses. While the division was posted to Harpers Ferry, Greene took a three-week sick leave. Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard speculated that Greene, like many of his fellow officers, was sickened by the stench of dead and wounded at Antietam. When he returned, there was a new division commander, Brig. Gen. Geary. Greene was disgruntled that Geary, with only a few days seniority over him, was selected for the post; Geary had been wounded at Cedar Mountain and his combat record was not as good, but his political connections and <b>a</b> <b>sentiment</b> that a wounded officer should not be set back in his career unnecessarily, gave him the nod.|$|E
5|$|Two so {{dissimilar}} {{painters and}} tempers as Einar Jolin and GAN were both called Expressionists. During {{most of the}} 1910s this term was used {{in a number of}} contexts in Sweden. In 1915, the Herwarth Walden gallery Der Sturm in Berlin, a venue for Expressionists, presented an exhibition, Schwedishe Expressionisten (Swedish Expressionism), with works by Swedish artists. Jolin participated with six paintings, three of these were vistas from Stockholm. The rest of the participants were Isaac Grunewald, Edward Hald, GAN and Sigrid Hjertén. In the autumn of 1915, Jolin and GAN held a joint exhibition in Lund University's art museum. Despite their differences, their friendship continued during GAN's years in Stockholm (1916–1919). Jolin was tired of Isaac Grünewalds increasingly dominant role among the young Swedish artists at that time, <b>a</b> <b>sentiment</b> shared by GAN. Expressionism never became a dominant style for Jolin, not in the way GAN {{and other members of the}} group embraced it. GAN always objected to Jolin's choice to include colors such as pearl gray and light purple or violet in his paintings.|$|E
5|$|A {{preponderance}} of historians favour {{the story that}} though the Victorious had sailed through the Lombok Strait rather than the Sunda, Britain had come off easily the best through {{a show of force}} during the Sunda Straits Crisis. Numerous accounts, including Gregory Fremont-Barnes' History of Counterinsurgency, are content with a simplified version that Indonesia closed the Strait for one reason or another, and that the arrival of the task force assembled around the aging carrier had intimidated Sukarno into reopening it. A common argument is that the passage was an effective and daring show of force, and often ignores the Sunda Strait issue altogether. This was <b>a</b> <b>sentiment</b> shown by the crew of the Victorious herself, who during their passage through the Lombok Strait went to action stations at the sight of an Indonesian submarine and prepared to fire on it if there was any sign of hostility, and believed that the Indonesians thought it wiser to hold back in fear of their power. This was not a view that the British official reports sought to dissuade, depicting the result as a compromise concession by the Indonesians, who had in brinksmanship terms, 'blinked first' after British refusal to back down. The Foreign Office even went to the extremity of claiming that the Lombok Strait was just as convenient for passage as the Sunda Strait, despite its far greater distance from Singapore and Australia. At the very least, the subsequent Indonesian United Nations defeat and Abdul Rahman's agreement to avoid retaliation was a very positive result for Britain to take from the incident.|$|E

25|$|The {{alteration}} {{in status}} was stirred by <b>a</b> <b>sentiment</b> {{on the part}} of the prime ministers of the self-governing colonies of the British Empire that a new term was necessary to differentiate them from the non-self-governing colonies. At the 1907 Imperial Conference, it was argued that self-governing colonies that were not styled ‘dominion’ like Canada, or ‘commonwealth’ like Australia, should be designated by some such title as ‘state of the empire’. After much debate over lexicon, the term ‘Dominion’ was decided upon.|$|E

25|$|Brunel did {{not live}} to see the bridge finished, {{although}} his colleagues and admirers at the Institution of Civil Engineers felt it would be a fitting memorial, and started to raise new funds and to amend the design. Work recommenced in 1862 and was completed in 1864, five years after Brunel's death. In 2011 it was suggested, by historian and biographer Adrian Vaughan, that Brunel did not design the bridge, as eventually built, as the later changes to its design were substantial. His views reflected <b>a</b> <b>sentiment</b> stated fifty two years earlier by Tom Rolt in his 1959 book Brunel. Re-engineering of suspension chains recovered from an earlier suspension bridge was one of many reasons given why Brunel's design could not be followed exactly.|$|E
25|$|According to Assyrian records, Sennacherib {{was assassinated}} in 681 BC, twenty years after the 701 BC {{invasion}} of Judah. A Neo-Babylonian letter corroborates with the biblical account <b>a</b> <b>sentiment</b> from Sennacherib’s sons to assassinate him, an event Assyriologists have reconstructed as historical. The son Ardi-Mulishi, who is mentioned in the letter as killing anyone who would reveal his conspiracy, successfully murders his father in c. 681 BC, and was most likely the Adrammelech in 2 Kings, though Sharezer is not known elsewhere. Assyriologists posit the murder was motivated because Esarhaddon was chosen as {{heir to the throne}} instead of Ardi-Mulishi, the next eldest son. Assyrian and Hebrew biblical history corroborate that Esarhaddon ultimately did succeed the throne. Other Assyriologists assert that Sennacherib was murdered in revenge for his destruction of Babylon, a city sacred to all Mesopotamians, including the Assyrians.|$|E
40|$|The {{sentiment}} {{captured in}} opinionated text provides interesting and valuable informa-tion for social media services.

Our framework can greatly reduce the human effort for building <b>a</b> domain-specific <b>sentiment</b> lexicon with high qual-ity. Specifically, in our evaluation, work-ing with just 20 manually labeled reviews, it generates <b>a</b> domain-specific <b>sentiment</b> lexicon that yields weighted average F-Measure gains of 3 %. Our sentiment clas-sification model achieves approximately 1 % greater accuracy than a state-of-the-art approach based on elementary discourse units. ...|$|R
50|$|The idea of {{sentiment}} runs through much, if not all, of the Emin philosophy. The premise being that <b>a</b> person's <b>sentiment</b> towards anything, including themselves, will largely determine {{what type of}} relationship, dealing or interaction they might have with that thing. As an example, if a person has <b>a</b> good <b>sentiment</b> towards the planet then they will respect her and appreciate her processes and will want to help in issues that might affect her well being. And, <b>a</b> person's <b>sentiment</b> towards their partner will likewise determine {{the nature of that}} relationship. This can be extended and applied to any matter at all and is viewed as being fundamental to a person's spiritual journey especially where integration is concerned.|$|R
