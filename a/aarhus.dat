5|$|The first daily {{newspaper}} {{to appear in}} <b>Aarhus</b> was Århus Stiftstidende, established in 1794 as Aarhuus Stifts Adresse-Contoirs Tidender, with a moderately conservative approach. Once one of Denmark's largest, it was a leading provincial newspaper for a time, but after the Second World War it increasingly faced competition from Demokraten (1884–1974) and Jyllands-Posten, both published in <b>Aarhus.</b> In 1998, it merged with Randers Amtsavis and is now run by Midtjyske Medier, part of Berlingske Media. The {{daily newspaper}} of Jyllandsposten (today known as Jyllands-Posten) was established in 1871 in <b>Aarhus,</b> and takes a generally right-wing editorial approach. With {{a reputation as a}} serious news publication, the paper has always included news from Jutland in particular, but somewhat less so since its promotion as a national newspaper (Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten) in the 1960s. Today {{it is one of the}} three leading serious newspapers in Denmark, the others being Berlingske and Politiken. Jyllands-Posten publishes JP <b>Aarhus,</b> a section dedicated to news in and around <b>Aarhus,</b> and hosted a free cityguide website from 2010 to 2016. The Copenhagen-based media company of Politiken, also publishes several free local papers once a week in parts of Denmark and Sweden. In <b>Aarhus,</b> they publish a total of five local newspapers; <b>Aarhus</b> Midt, <b>Aarhus</b> Nord, <b>Aarhus</b> Vest, <b>Aarhus</b> Syd and <b>Aarhus</b> Weekend.|$|E

A small seaplane now operates four flights daily between <b>Aarhus</b> harbour and Copenhagen harbour.|$|E
5|$|The main {{railway station}} in <b>Aarhus</b> is <b>Aarhus</b> Central Station {{located in the}} city centre. DSB has {{connections}} to destinations throughout Denmark and beyond.

5|$|Today <b>Aarhus</b> {{is at the}} {{cultural}} and economic core {{of the region and}} the largest centre for trade, services and industry in Jutland. The city ranks as the 92nd largest city in the European Union, and as number 234 among world cities. It is also a top 100 conference city in the world. <b>Aarhus</b> is the principal industrial port of the country in terms of container handling and an important trade hub in Kattegat.

5|$|Founded in {{the early}} Viking Age, <b>Aarhus</b> {{is one of the}} oldest cities in Denmark, along with Ribe and Hedeby.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19thcentury {{industrialisation}} came into full effect and a number of new industries emerged around production and refinement of agricultural products, especially oil and butter. Many companies from this time would come to leave permanent iconic marks on <b>Aarhus.</b> The Ceres Brewery was established in 1856 and served as Aarhus' local brewery for more than 150 years, gradually expanding into an industrial district known as Ceres-grunden (lit.: the Ceres-grounds). In 1896 local farmers and businessmen created Korn- og Foderstof Kompagniet (KFK), focused on grain and feedstuffs. KFK established departments all over the country, while its headquarters remained in <b>Aarhus</b> where its large grain silos still stand today. Otto Mønsted created the Danish Preserved Butter Company in 1874, focusing on butter export to England, China and Africa and later founded the <b>Aarhus</b> Butterine Company in 1883, the first Danish margarine factory. The industry became an important employer, with factory employees increasing from 100 in 1896 to 1,000 in 1931, effectively transforming the city from a regional trade hub into an industrial centre. Other new factories of note included the dockyard <b>Aarhus</b> Flydedok, the oil mill Århus Oliefabrik and the ironworks Frichs.|$|E
5|$|Private {{hospitals}} specialised {{in different}} areas from plastic surgery to fertility treatments operate in <b>Aarhus</b> as well. Ciconia <b>Aarhus</b> Private Hospital founded in 1984 is a leading Danish fertility clinic and {{the first of its}} kind in Denmark. Ciconia has provided for the birth of 6,000 children by artificial insemination and continually conducts research into the field of fertility. Aagaard Clinic, established in 2004, is another private fertility and gynaecology clinic which since 2004 has undertaken fertility treatments that has resulted in 1550 births. <b>Aarhus</b> Municipality also offers a number of specialised services in the areas of nutrition, exercise, sex, smoking and drinking, activities for the elderly, health courses and lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The Moesgård Museum specialises in {{archaeology}} and ethnography {{in collaboration with}} <b>Aarhus</b> University with exhibits on Denmark's prehistory, including weapon sacrifices from Illerup Ådal and the Grauballe Man. Kvindemuseet, the Women's Museum, from 1984 contains collections of the lives and works of women in Danish cultural history. The Occupation Museum (Besættelsesmuseum) presents exhibits illustrating the German occupation of the city during the Second World War; the University Park {{on the campus of}} <b>Aarhus</b> University includes the Natural History Museum with 5,000 species of animals, many in their natural surroundings; and the Steno Museum is a museum of the history of science and medicine with a planetarium. Kunsthal <b>Aarhus</b> (<b>Aarhus</b> Art Hall) hosts exhibitions of contemporary art including painting, sculpture, photography, performance art, film and video. Strictly speaking it is not a museum but an arts centre, and one of the oldest in Europe, built and founded in 1917.|$|E
5|$|The acting {{scene in}} <b>Aarhus</b> is diverse, with many groups and venues {{including}} <b>Aarhus</b> Teater, Svalegangen, EntréScenen, Katapult, Gruppe 38, Godsbanen, Helsingør Teater, Det Andet Teater and Teater Refleksion {{as well as}} several dance venues like Bora Bora and Granhøj Dans. The city hosts a biannual international theatre festival, International Living Theatre (ILT), the next event being scheduled for 2017.

5|$|The {{city centre}} {{is packed with}} cafés, {{especially}} along {{the river and the}} Latin quarter. Some of them also include an evening restaurant, such as Café Casablanca, Café Carlton, Café Cross and Gyngen. <b>Aarhus</b> Street Food and <b>Aarhus</b> Central Food Market are two new indoor food courts from 2016 in the city centre comprising a variety of street food restaurants, cafés and bars.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} <b>Aarhus</b> is {{predominantly}} knowledge and service based, {{strongly influenced by}} the University of <b>Aarhus</b> and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality. The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 {{in the private sector}} and the rest split between state, region and municipality. The region is a major agricultural producer, with many large farms in the outlying districts. People commute to <b>Aarhus</b> {{from as far away as}} Randers, Silkeborg and Skanderborg and almost a third of those employed within <b>Aarhus</b> municipality commute from neighbouring communities. <b>Aarhus</b> is a centre for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres, the busiest commercial street in the country and a dense urban core with many speciality shops.|$|E
5|$|The hilly {{area around}} <b>Aarhus</b> {{consists}} of a moranial plateau from the last ice age, broken by a complex system of tunnel valleys. The most prominent valleys of this network are the <b>Aarhus</b> Valley in the south, stretching inland east-west with the <b>Aarhus</b> River, Brabrand Lake, Årslev Lake and Tåstrup Lake, and the Egå Valley to the north, with the stream of Egåen, the bog of Geding-Kasted Mose and Geding Lake. Most parts of the two valleys have been drained and subsequently farmed, {{but in the early}} 2000s some of the drainage was removed and parts of the wetlands were restored for environmental reasons. The valley system also includes the stream of Lyngbygård Å in the west and valleys to the south of the city, following erosion channels from the pre-quaternary. By contrast, the <b>Aarhus</b> River Valley and the Giber River Valley are late glacial meltwater valleys. The coastal cliffs along the Bay of <b>Aarhus</b> consist of shallow tertiary clay from the Eocene and Oligocene (57 to 24 million years ago).|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than 30 tourist {{information}} spots across the city, some of them staffed, while others are on-line, publicly accessible touch screens. The official tourist information service in <b>Aarhus</b> is organised under VisitAaarhus, a corporate foundation initiated in 1994 by <b>Aarhus</b> Municipality and local commercial interest organisations.|$|E
5|$|A more {{traditional}} approach {{was taken by}} Kay Fisker who, together with C. F. Møller, designed buildings for <b>Aarhus</b> University from 1931 onwards.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aarhus</b> {{has hosted}} many {{sporting}} events including the 2010 European Women's Handball Championship, the 2014 European Men's Handball Championship, the 2013 Men's European Volleyball Championships, the 2005 European Table Tennis Championships, the Denmark Open in badminton, the UCI Women's Road Cycling World Cup, the 2006 World Orienteering Championships, the 2006 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships and the GF World Cup (women's handball). <b>Aarhus</b> is on average host {{to one or}} two international sailing competitions every year and hosted the ISAF Youth Sailing World Championships in 2008 and will in 2018 host the ISAF Sailing World Championships, the world championship for the 12 Olympic sailing disciplines and an important qualifier for the 2020 Olympics.|$|E

5|$|<b>Aarhus</b> {{is home to}} many annual {{cultural}} events and festivals, museums, theatres, and sport events of both national and international importance, and presents {{some of the largest}} cultural attractions in Denmark. There is a long tradition here in music of all genres and many Danish bands have emerged from <b>Aarhus.</b> Libraries, cultural centres and educational institutions present free or easy opportunities for the citizens to participate in, engage in, or be creative with {{cultural events}} and productions of all kinds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aarhus</b> is the {{principal}} centre for education in the Jutland region. It draws students from a large area, especially from the western and southern parts of the peninsula. The relatively large influx of young people and students creates a natural base for cultural activities. <b>Aarhus</b> has the greatest concentration of students in Denmark, fully 12% of citizens attending short, medium or long courses of study. In addition to around 25 institutions of higher education, several research forums have evolved {{to assist in the}} transfer of expertise from education to business. The city is home to more than 52,000 students.|$|E
5|$|Accelerating growth {{since the}} early 2000s brought the inner urban area to roughly 260,000 {{inhabitants}} by 2014. The rapid growth {{is expected to continue}} until at least 2030 when <b>Aarhus</b> municipality has set an ambitious target for 375,000 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Another {{participant}} in the National Romanticism movement was Hack Kampmann who designed the <b>Aarhus</b> Theatre in the Art Nouveau style {{at the very end}} of the century.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, David Field and {{researchers}} at <b>Aarhus</b> University discovered spontaneous electric fields when creating prosaic films of various gases. This has more recently expanded {{to form the}} research area of spontelectrics.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{he was a}} {{keynote speaker}} at the {{leadership}} conference <b>Aarhus</b> Symposium, in which he addressed the role of creativity and empowerment in leadership.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to take individual higher education courses in Commerce from the Business School in Kambsdalur and in Tórshavn. The alumni can work {{at the same time}} and take one course each semester. After three years they will have achieved 60 ECTS which is the same as the first part of the HD education. They can also take the second part of the HD education from the Business College, and they can also combine it with courses from the <b>Aarhus</b> University via distant education. If they wish to study further for at MBA they must take it from a university in Denmark, i.e. the <b>Aarhus</b> University.|$|E
5|$|Libraries in Denmark {{are also}} {{cultural}} and community centres. They {{play an active}} role in the cultural life and host many events, exhibitions, discussion groups, workshops, educational courses and facilitate everyday cultural activities for and by the citizens. In June 2015, the large central library and cultural centre of Dokk1 opened at the harbour front. Dokk1 also includes civil administrations and services, commercial office rentals and a large underground robotic car park and aims to be a landmark for the city and a public meeting place. The building of Dokk1 and the associated squares and streetscape is also collectively known as Urban Mediaspace <b>Aarhus</b> and it is the largest construction project <b>Aarhus</b> municipality has ever undertaken. Apart from this large main library, some neighbourhoods in <b>Aarhus</b> have a local library engaged in similar cultural and educational activities, but on a more local scale.|$|E
