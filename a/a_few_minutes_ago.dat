25|$|Yesterday I {{stood at}} Arlington National Cemetery {{attending}} {{the funeral of}} a young Marine in my district. He believed in {{what we were doing}} is the right thing and had the courage to lay his life on the line to do it. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He asked me to send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that we will see this through.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned and}} faced me. He was {{certainly}} paler {{than he had}} been <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
60|$|Yes, sir. She came <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> {{with her}} little boy. They are with Mrs. Starkweather.|$|E
60|$|Colonel Harris, sitting {{near his}} daughter, {{would have given}} worlds {{to know what she}} thought. He himself {{did not know what to}} think. His simple, unsophisticated mind was in a maze. The {{question}} of Luke's possible guilt had suddenly loomed up before him, dissipating the former blind impulse of partisanship and loyalty. Mr. Dobson too looked puzzled, the old family solicitor who had seen Luke and his brothers and sister grow up, who <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours, nay <b>minutes,</b> <b>ago</b> would have sworn to his client's innocence before the entire world, he too now was face to face with a hideous feeling of doubt.|$|R

6000|$|... "What I {{want to ask}} you is this," [...] Sabatini said. [...] "A <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> you {{declared}} that you were anxious to discover the whereabouts of your little friend's uncle. Tell me why?" ...|$|R
6000|$|His cousin {{shook her}} head mournfully. [...] "And <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> I was nearly observing that you had lost your sense of humour!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{picked up}} a funny-colored bean and ate it, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b> Queer flavor it had, too. Nothing else that I can think of." ...|$|E
6000|$|COLONEL, to Steve, who {{is indeed}} the more bewildered of the two, 'And <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> I assure you she was weeping on my shoulder!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Bending {{her head}} forward {{on her hand}} and weeping.) I have been so lonely--and then you--you came, and the world grew bright and warm--a <b>few</b> short <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> you held me--in your arms--a <b>few</b> short <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> and it seemed my dream of {{happiness}} had come true--and now you dash it from me-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think we}} ought to ask a great and busy lawyer to {{accommodate}} himself to our piffling social plans," [...] replied Mrs. Joyce. [...] "A <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> you were wild to join these experiments, now you are crazy to go home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [A <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> the Comtesse de la Briere, {{who has not}} {{recently}} been in England, was shown into the London home of the Shands. Though not sufficiently interested to express her surprise in words, she raised her eyebrows on finding herself in a charming room; she has presumed that the Shand scheme of decoration would be as impossible as themselves.|$|R
60|$|All {{that had}} {{happened}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> in the blueberry patch seemed a far-off dream; the reality had died out of the looks and words.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a pity {{you were}} not here <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b> I have just bought a picture. You might have put the thing through for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{will not}} be there at all this evening," [...] the porter answered. [...] "The second maitre d'hotel was here <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> and told me so himself." ...|$|E

"A <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> I had <b>a</b> {{telegram}} from President William Lowe Bryan of Indiana University {{accepting the}} exhibit, and I am directing Miss Ver Nooy {{to send it}} to Bloomington {{at the end of this}} week.

6000|$|... "With the Servian Minister's wife. I shall excuse myself early. It {{is a vital}} {{necessity}} that we {{talk for}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> before you leave here. Five <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> I sent a note to your rooms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's better; keep it so <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> and I'll be done," [...] {{cried the}} artist, forgetting that <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> may seem ages.|$|R
6000|$|... "We don't know," [...] replied Paul. [...] "We {{just got}} back from the river <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> and found the barn door broken open and both horses gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... {Margaret}, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> {{when you}} told me there was nothing between you and this man, you lied to me--lied to me as only a wicked woman can lie.|$|E
60|$|She {{smiled a}} little half-heartedly. It was curious that she found herself {{contrasting}} for a moment this very elegant young man with her roughly dressed companion of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
6000|$|In <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>a</b> servant {{came down}} and spoke to Ernest. 'My lord {{would like to see}} you upstairs for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> if you please, sir.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Moist warmth for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> before nursing {{may help}} the milk begin to flow. Avoid using warmth {{for more than}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> as the warmth can {{increase}} swelling and inflammation.|$|R
60|$|Lamartine was <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> late. He {{drove up}} {{in a large}} motor-car with an elderly gentleman, who {{remained}} inside, and with whom he talked for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> earnestly before he joined me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was sitting}} in my garden <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> having a pipe before {{finishing}} {{the rest of my}} papers, and Wyatt dropped from the wall on to my herbaceous border." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is I--Arnold Chetwode," [...] Arnold answered. [...] "I am {{speaking}} {{from the office}} in the city. I heard some news <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> which I thought might interest you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] he said, [...] "I did {{not know}} you were here until <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> and I will not keep you now. I think the Señora is waiting for you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> {{had been}} all she asked for. In <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> she turned toward them again. Her sweet voice was steady once more; her eyes rested softly on Horace as she went on.|$|R

60|$|In <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>a</b> waiter came to {{ask what}} Rollo would have for breakfast. He asked in French. Rollo gave an order for breakfast for two. He said that his uncle would be down in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You're all right," [...] {{repeated}} Bill. [...] "One good turn deserves another, Tom. You {{saved my}} life <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> and now I've hauled you out o' the water, old boy." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{turned away}} with a little sigh. The tragedy which <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> she had seen looming up, eluded her. She had courted a dénouement in vain. He was too clever.|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw {{you come}} in here <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> and I followed, because I want to speak to you," [...] said Andy, shoving to the front and eyeing the fellow closely.|$|E
60|$|The Frenchmen rose <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> {{later and}} took their leave, ceremoniously but with obvious discontent. The Prime Minister {{leaned back in}} his chair and awaited his secretary's return with a well-satisfied smile. In <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> the latter {{presented}} himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{does not}} matter," [...] was the grave reply. [...] "Ten <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> I had an urgent {{telephone}} call from our mutual friend.
