5000|$|By way of history, the Australian Government {{established}} the Legal Services Bureaux in 1942 {{to develop a}} national system. In 1973 the Attorney-General in the Whitlam Labor government, Lionel Murphy, {{established the}} Australian Legal Aid Office. Murphy recognised {{the urgent need for}} legal aid in order for justice to be equally available for all. Murphy recognised that: [...] "one of the basic causes of the inequality of citizens before the laws is the absence of adequate and comprehensive legal <b>aid</b> <b>arrangements</b> throughout Australia ... The ultimate object of the Government is that legal aid be readily and equally available to citizens everywhere in Australia and that aid be extended for advice and assistance of litigation as well as for litigation in all legal categories and in all courts." [...] (Senator the Hon Lionel Murphy AO QC, Attorney General) The establishment of the Australian Legal Aid Office in 1973 was followed by the establishment of state-based Legal Aid Commissions. These offices now provide the majority of free or lowcost legal assistance to those in need. In 1977, the Australian Government enacted the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Act 1977 (LAC Act), which established cooperative arrangements between the Australian Government and state and territory governments, under which legal aid would be provided by independent legal aid commissions to be established under state and territory legislation. The process of establishing the LACs took more than a decade. It commenced in 1976 with the establishment of the Legal Aid Commission of Western Australia, followed in 1978 the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria (LACV), and ended in 1990 with the establishment of the Legal Aid Commission of Tasmania. The cooperative arrangements that were established by the LAC Act provided for Commonwealth and state and territory legal aid funding agreements, which began in 1987.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} by Charlotte Sieber-Gasser at the African IEL Network Conference, 5 th- 6 th of May 2011, The Mandela Institute, Johannesburg (South Africa) Sino-African trade {{has seen a}} fifty-fold increase in the years 1999 to 2008. China became {{the second most important}} trading partner for the African economy and already overtook the US as the most important trading partner in some African regions. However, all of this trade is taking place independent from legal regulation by a preferential or other trade agreement. Interestingly, Sino-African trade has seen particular increase in countries that have agreed to tied <b>aid</b> <b>arrangements</b> with China. Taking a closer look at these tied <b>aid</b> <b>arrangements</b> (the so-called Angola-Model) reveals, that some aspects might indeed {{have a positive effect on}} Sino-African trade in general. Several grey areas might potentially conflict with WTO-law. However, tied aid is excluded from the GATS, the GATT, and the GPA – in other words, it is outside the sphere of WTO-law.

30|$|Recent {{scholarship}} {{on the global}} South has sought to articulate and evaluate South-South relations through the notion of solidarity. Nel and Taylor (2013) define ‘South-South solidarity’ as an attitude, feeling and relationship based on “the collective pursuit of a common good, the recognition and observance of reciprocal moral duties, including respect for national sovereignty, fundamental equality and mutual benefit” (Nel and Taylor 2013 : 1091). The shared experience of colonisation (Grovogui 2011) and hardship among peoples of the global South becomes the basis for mutual feelings of empathy for one another (Nel and Taylor 2013). Drawing from the principle of solidarity, global South countries have developed their own models of cooperation. In contrast to conditional <b>aid</b> <b>arrangements</b> in North–south cooperation, global South models are characterised by mutual benefit, autonomy and non-intervention between partners (Quadir 2013 : 324 – 325). For example, Brazil promotes horizontal cooperation in which partners work as equals to achieve mutually agreed development goals (Quadir 2013 : 324). China’s model not only pursues mutual gain but also non-intervention between partners (DeHart 2012 : 1367). Indeed, solidarity serves as the moral framework of South-South relations.|$|E

It then discusses some of the significant developments in the EU and in CARICOM during the late 1980 s and 1990 s.

40|$|Background: Progress toward meeting Millennium Development Goal 5, {{which aims}} to improve {{maternal}} and reproductive health outcomes, is behind schedule. This is despite ever increasing volumes of official development aid targeting the goal, calling into question the distribution and efficacy of aid. The 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness represented a global commitment to reform aid practices {{in order to improve}} development outcomes, encouraging a shift toward collaborative <b>aid</b> <b>arrangements</b> which support the national plans of aid recipient countries (and discouraging unaligned donor projects). Methods and Findings: We conducted a systematic review to summarise the evidence of the impact on MDG 5 outcomes of official development aid delivered in line with Paris aid effectiveness principles and to compare this with the impact of aid in general on MDG 5 outcomes. Searches of electronic databases identified 30 studies reporting aid-funded interventions designed to improve maternal and reproductive health outcomes. Aid interventions appear to be associated with small improvements in the MDG indicators, although {{it is not clear whether}} changes are happening because of the manner in which aid is delivered. The data do not allow for a meaningful comparison between Paris style and general aid. The review identified discernible gaps in the evidence base on aid interventions targeting MDG 5, notably on indicators MDG 5. 4 (adolescent birth rate) and 5. 6 (unmet need for family planning).

Every school owes a duty of care to persons invited to the school for a fete and the principal and school council can be held liable for any injury occurring on school premises.

Relevant legislative requirements must be satisfied too, such as procuring a permit to hold raffles (a type of gambling). Food provision is also covered by legislative requirements and the use of fireworks should by only undertaken by a licensed pyrotechnician. Consideration must be given to fire safety measures and there must be a system for the collection of money from stall holders.

40|$|Sino-African {{trade has}} seen a fifty-fold {{increase}} in the years 1999 to 2008. In some African regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, China has even replaced the US {{as the most important}} trading partner today. But China holds not a single FTA on the African continent, while other major trading partners of African economies rely on an extensive framework of different trade agreements. What is, thus, the legal basis of the recent increase of Sino-African trade? Interestingly, Sino-African trade {{has seen a}} particularly strong increase in countries that have entered into tied aid agreements with China. These agreements are commonly known under the term ‘Angola-Model’ and consist of a multifaceted network of barter-trading-systems, aspects of tied aid and concessions for oil and other commodities linked with a state loan. It is likely that these agreements {{have an impact on the}} trade-flows between African countries and China. This paper discusses the legal character of this new form of economic cooperation, or modern version of tied aid. Critical legal aspects related to this form of tied aid refer to violation of the principle of most-favoured nation (MFN), illegitimate export subsidies, market access, public procurement and transparency in the international trading system. However, despite the recent outcry of the foremost Western community against the strategy of the Chinese government on the African continent, the practice of the Angola-Model based tied aid is not entirely new, and neither is it against the law. The case of tied aid is situated in a legal grey area that should be examined thoroughly in order to strengthen the international trading system and to support developing countries in their attempt to gain from tied <b>aid</b> <b>arrangements...</b>|$|E
