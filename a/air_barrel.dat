50|$|Some inline {{blowback}} markers will leak <b>air</b> {{from the}} <b>barrel</b> when uncocked. The striker sits forward against the seal pin, causing the cup seal to open enough to leak {{air from the}} valve, which escapes out the barrel.

The rear spring can be damaged if stored {{a long time in}} a cocked position.|$|R
5|$|Continuous U.S. <b>air</b> {{support for}} <b>Barrel</b> Roll {{operations}} {{was provided by}} the aircraft of the 602nd and 606th Special Operations Squadrons, elements of the 56th Air Commando Wing (as of 8 April 1967 the 56th Special Operations Wing), based at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. On 25 October 1967, they were joined by the 22nd Special Operations Squadron. Pre-planned airstrikes in the Barrel Roll area were rare. Until 1968, most U.S. jet fighter-bomber sorties only occurred when aircraft were returning to Thailand from Rolling Thunder missions carrying unexpended ordnance loads. They would then be directed to targets in northeastern Laos.|$|R
50|$|Paintballs {{generally}} change {{shape or}} size due to differing temperature or humidity, or even due to varying manufacturing processes. If a paintball {{is larger than}} the barrel bore, it will at a minimum cause reduced efficiency due to increased friction. Oversized paintballs can also break inside the barrel and coat the inside with paint, causing shot inaccuracy until it is cleaned out. If the paintball is too small for the <b>barrel,</b> <b>air</b> will escape around the paintball when firing, causing a drop in velocity and accuracy. Correcting for this by adjusting the velocity adjuster on the marker could cause a lack of air efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Blowgun: A blowgun is a {{small hand}} held device used to blow away debris from a work area and is {{designed}} to be used attached to a compressed air line. It uses a sprung poppet valve operated by a lever to allow air through its body and out through a specially shaped nozzle. In spudgunning it is used to pilot larger valves—releasing a small volume of air to allow a piston or diaphragm to fly back and release a much larger volume of <b>air</b> into the <b>barrel.</b> It is also used as the primary valve for small cannons which fire airsoft pellets and so do not require high air flow. Blowguns can be modified to increase airflow.|$|R

6000|$|The {{reader will}} {{understand}} that the object to be first achieved, was to raise a vessel, with a hold filled with flour and gunpowder, from off {{the bottom of the}} bay to its surface. As she stood, the deck of this vessel was about six feet under water, and every one {{will understand that}} her weight, so long as it was submerged in a fluid as dense as that of the sea, would be much more manageable than if suspended in <b>air.</b> The <b>barrels,</b> for instance, were not much heavier than the water they displaced, and the wood work of the vessel itself, was, on the whole, positively lighter than the element in which it had sunk. As for the water in the hold, that was of the same weight as the water on the outside of tne craft, and there had not been much to carry the schooner down, beside her iron, the spars that were out of water, and her ballast. This last, some ten or twelve tons in weight, was in fact the principal difficulty, and alone induced Spike to have any doubts about his eventual success. There was no foreseeing the result until he had made a trial, however; and the order was again given to [...] "heave away." ...|$|R
30|$|Thermal {{desorption}} {{should be}} carried out in an oxygen isolation environment, and air locks are installed at the feeding port and the discharge port of TDU. Before the experiment, steam is switched to device for purging and replacing the air inside. The feeding mode is intermittent, {{a certain amount of}} materials entered the <b>air</b> lock storage <b>barrel</b> first, then steam is opened to purge and replace the air mixed with feeding, and then materials are transferred into thermal desorption barrel. The discharging process {{is similar to that of}} the feeding. The barrel and two screw shafts are heated rapidly by induction heating, and materials can be heated rapidly during conveying. The total heating time of the material, that is, the heating residence time, is equal to the material conveying time.|$|R

50|$|The usual recoil {{system in}} modern quick-firing guns is the hydro-pneumatic recoil system. In this system, the barrel {{is mounted on}} rails on which it can recoil to the rear, and the recoil is taken up by a {{cylinder}} which is similar in operation to an automotive gas-charged shock absorber, and is commonly visible as a cylinder mounted parallel to {{the barrel of the}} gun, but shorter and smaller than it. The cylinder contains a charge of compressed air, as well as hydraulic oil; in operation, the barrel's energy is taken up in compressing the <b>air</b> as the <b>barrel</b> recoils backward, then is dissipated via hydraulic damping as the barrel returns forward to the firing position. The recoil impulse is thus spread out over the time in which the barrel is compressing the air, rather than over the much narrower interval of time when the projectile is being fired. This greatly reduces the peak force conveyed to the mount (or to the ground on which the gun has been emplaced).|$|R
5000|$|The T68 core is {{a design}} similar in action to the Spyder markers. Primary systems (<b>Barrel,</b> <b>Air</b> System, Feed System & Trigger) {{attach to the}} core. Additional {{external}} components add to the overall M-4 look. These include a carry handle (fixed or removable with RIS weaver rail), T-charging (cocking) handle (Gen 3 upwards), pistol grip with trigger guard, faux clip housing with working magazine release, fake magazine with hollow interior (for storage), M-4 handguard assembly with interchangeable front handguards, M-4 forward sight with bayonet lug and sling loop, and either 3-position M4 Carbine or fixed M-16A2 style stock. Various barrel lengths and styles are available, from 1" [...] through 20", with interchangeable muzzle flash suppressors or faux silencers. The barrels use Spyder threads, so aftermarket barrels are also capable of being used. Made from machined aircraft aluminum, the marker is mechanical, with no electronic parts in its factory form. A screw is provided under the stock for adjustment of the shooting velocity, and a simple push-safe safety is situated {{just ahead of the}} trigger on the core.|$|R
2500|$|On 19 September 2016, a UN/Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) aid convoy was {{attacked}} at night, {{as well as}} a SARC warehouse and health clinic in Urum al-Kubra, a rebel-held town 12km west of Aleppo. 20 civilians and one SARC staff member were killed, while food and medical aid, intended to reach Aleppo, was destroyed.

50|$|The gun's barrel {{slid back}} on rollers, {{including}} a {{set at the}} muzzle, when the shot was fired. The barrel was attached near the breech to a piston rod extending into an oil-filled cylinder placed just underneath the gun. When the barrel recoiled, the piston was pulled back by the barrel's recoil and thus pushed the oil through a small orifice and into a second cylinder placed underneath. That second cylinder contained a freely floating piston which separated the surging oil from a confined volume of compressed <b>air.</b> During the <b>barrel's</b> recoil the floating piston was forced forward by the oil, compressing the air even further. This action absorbed the recoil progressively as the internal air pressure rose and, {{at the end of}} recoil, generated a strong but decreasing back pressure that returned the gun forward to its original position. The smoothness of this system had no equal in 1897, and for at least another ten years. Each recoil cycle on the French 75, including the return forward, lasted about two seconds, permitting a maximum attainable firing rate of about 30 rounds per minute.|$|R

5000|$|The Syrian {{government}} has reportedly used [...] "barrel bombs" [...] to attack civilian populations in rebel held territories {{in defiance of}} United Nations Security Council Resolution 2139 passed on February 22, 2014.

5000|$|A recoil system absorbs recoil energy, {{reducing}} the peak {{force that is}} conveyed to whatever the gun is mounted on. Old-fashioned cannons without a recoil system roll several meters backwards when fired.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the serial Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences [© Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] set of well-defined experiments has been carried out to explore whether microneedles (MNs) can enhance the penetration depths of microparticles moving at high velocity such as those expected in gene guns for delivery of gene-loaded microparticles into target tissues. These experiments are based on applying solid MNs that are used to reduce the effect of mechanical barrier function of the target so as to allow delivery of microparticles at less imposed pressure as compared with most typical gene guns. Further, a low-cost material, namely, biomedical-grade stainless steel microparticle with size ranging between 1 and 20 μm, has been used in this study. The microparticles are compressed and bound {{in the form of a}} cylindrical pellet and mounted on a ground slide, which are then accelerated together by compressed <b>air</b> through a <b>barrel.</b> When the ground slide reaches the end of the barrel, the pellet is separated from the ground slide and is broken down into particle form by a mesh that is placed at the end of the barrel. Subsequently, these particles penetrate into the target. This paper investigates the implications of velocity of the pellet along with various other important factors that affect the particle delivery into the target. Our results suggest that the particle passage increases with an increase in pressure, mesh pore size, and decreases with increase in polyvinylpyrrolidone concentration. Most importantly, it is shown that MNs increase the penetration depths of the particles...|$|R
