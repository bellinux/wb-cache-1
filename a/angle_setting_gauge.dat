40|$|Abstract. A quantum {{mechanics}} based method {{is presented to}} generate <b>sets</b> of digital <b>angles</b> that may be well suited to describe projections on discrete grids. The resulting <b>angle</b> <b>sets</b> are an alternative to those derived using the Farey fractions from number theory. The Farey angles arise naturally through the definitions of the Mojette and Finite Radon Transforms. Often {{a subset of the}} Farey angles needs to be selected when reconstructing images from a limited number of views. The digital angles that result from the quantisation of angular momentum (QAM) vectors may provide an alternative way to select angle subsets. This paper seeks first to identify the important properties of digital <b>angles</b> <b>sets</b> and second to demonstrate that the QAM vectors are indeed a candidate set that fulfils these requirements. Of particular note is the rare occurrence of degeneracy in the QAM angles, particularly for the half-integral angular momenta <b>angle</b> <b>sets...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of newly proposed bicycle’s crank to crank <b>angle</b> <b>setting</b> on the Vastus Lateralis (VL) and Bicep Femoris (BF) muscle activity during cycling. Procedures of Conconi Test were used throughout the experiment for the data collection purpose. The muscles activities were recorded using surface electromyography and software LabChart 7. The raw data were further processed in time (Root-Mean-Square, RMS) and frequency (Mean Power Frequency, MPF) domain. It was found that 0 ° crank to crank setting (similar to conventional crank to crank <b>angle</b> <b>setting)</b> caused the prime mover VL (Normalized RMS = 0. 119) to fatigue more than BF (Normalized RMS = 0. 102). This setting is expected to decrease the cycling performance. In addition, − 5 ° is the best crank to crank <b>angle</b> <b>setting</b> that causes least fatigue to both VL and BF. In short, to increase the cycling performance by avoiding the fatigue to the main muscles, − 5 ° is the suggested as <b>setting</b> <b>angle</b> for the proposed crank design...|$|R

40|$|Noether gauge {{symmetry}} for F(R) {{theory of}} gravity has been explored recently. The fallacy is that, even after <b>setting</b> <b>gauge</b> to vanish, {{the form of}} F(R) ∝ R^n (where n ≠ 1, is arbitrary) obtained in the process, has been claimed to be an outcome of gauge Noether symmetry. On the contrary, earlier works proved that any nonlinear form other than F(R) ∝ R^ 3 / 2 is obscure. Here, we show that, <b>setting</b> <b>gauge</b> term zero, Noether equations are satisfied only for n = 2, which again does not satisfy the field equations. Thus, as noticed earlier, the only admissible form that Noether symmetry is F(R) ∝ R^ 3 / 2.

40|$|Three {{different}} methods for describing three dimensional joint angles {{are commonly used}} in biomechanics. The joint coordinate system and Cardan/Euler angles are conceptually quite different but are known to represent the same underlying mathematics. More recently the globographic method has been suggested as an alternative and this has proved particularly attractive for the shoulder joint. All three methods can be implemented {{in a number of}} ways leading to a choice of angle definitions. Very recently Rab has demonstrated that the globographic method is equivalent to one implementation of the joint coordinate system. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of the three {{different methods}} and proves their mathematical equivalence. The well known sequence dependence of Cardan/Euler is presented as equivalent to configuration dependence of the joint coordinate system and orientation dependence of globographic angles. The precise definition of different <b>angle</b> <b>sets</b> can be easily visualised using the globographic method using analogues of longitude, latitude and surface bearings with which most users will already be familiar. The method implicitly requires one axis of the moving segment to be identified as its principal axis and this can be extremely useful in helping define the most appropriate <b>angle</b> <b>set</b> to describe the orientation of any particular joint. Using this technique different <b>angle</b> <b>sets</b> are considered to be most appropriate for different joints and examples of this for the hip, knee, ankle, pelvis and axial skeleton are outlined...|$|R

40|$|For the four-dimensional SU(N) Euclidean Yang-Mills {{theory in}} the Landau gauge, we present two <b>sets</b> of <b>gauge</b> field {{configurations}} that satisfy the Euclidean equations of motion. These configurations generate four-dimensional chromo-field flux sheets whose spatial cross sections are three-dimensional chromo-field flux tubes. In lattice simulations, they may be detected as center vortices. The first <b>set</b> of <b>gauge</b> field configurations generates chromo-electric flux tubes that should contribute to a chromo-electric flux tube between two static color charges. The string tension for two static color charges in representation r then naturally satisfies the Casimir scaling. Applying a gauge transformation to this <b>set</b> of <b>gauge</b> field configurations, we can transform them into those in the maximal Abelian gauge. These transformed configurations generate chromo-electric flux tubes that should contribute to those observed between two static quarks in lattice simulations performed in the maximal Abelian <b>gauge.</b> The second <b>set</b> of <b>gauge</b> field configurations generates chromo-magnetic flux tubes. When rotated in a plane that includes the temporal-axis and is perpendicular to the flux tube axis, the rotated gauge field configuration generates a chromo-electric flux tube and should contribute to the chromo-electric flux tubes observed in lattice simulations in the Landau gauge. We also argue that when regulated on a lattice, any of the flux sheet gauge field configuration with a finite flux sheet thickness {{is located on the}} Gribov horizon in the infinite lattice volume limit. We thus suggest that these <b>sets</b> of <b>gauge</b> field configurations contribute significantly to the low energy properties of QCD, particularly the quark confinement. Comment: 31 pages.
