5000|$|In the United States, as {{a general}} rule, courts do not have {{self-executing}} powers. In other words, {{in order for the}} court to rule on a contested issue in a case before it, one of the parties or a third party must raise an <b>appropriate</b> <b>motion</b> asking for a particular order. Some motions may be made {{in the form of an}} oral request in open court, which is then either summarily granted or denied orally by the court. Today, however, most motions (especially on important or dispositive issues that could decide the entire case) are decided after oral argument preceded by the filing and service of legal papers. That is, the movant is usually required to serve advance written notice along with some kind of written legal argument justifying the motion. The legal argument may come in the form of a memorandum of points and authorities supported by affidavits or declarations. Some northeastern U.S. states have a tradition in which the legal argument comes in the form of an affidavit from the attorney, speaking personally as himself on behalf of his client. In contrast, in most U.S. states, the memorandum is written impersonally or as if the client were speaking directly to the court, and the attorney reserves declarations of his own personal knowledge to a separate declaration or affidavit (which are then cited to in the memorandum). One U.S. state, Missouri, uses the term [...] "suggestions" [...] for the memorandum of points and authorities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In the {{previous}} work, {{it was shown}} in simulation that by employing Actor-Q learning, active perception and recognition problem can be learned. In this learning, a camera with non-uniform resolution was assumed. <b>Appropriate</b> camera <b>motions</b> and recognition timing {{as well as the}} correct recognition were acquired through the reinforcement learning using the final recognition results as rewards and punishments[1]. In this paper, the authors tried to verify using a real camera whether <b>appropriate</b> continuous camera <b>motions</b> and identification of two patterns can be acquired simultaneously through Actor-Q learning. Here, non-uniform resolution was also applied. As a result, within a limited number of trials, these functions cannot be achieved. Then, three stages of learning are introduced. The system was trained on “camera motion ” task at first and then trained on “pattern recognition ” task. After that the system was trained on both “pattern recognition ” and “camera motion” simultaneously. It was verified that <b>appropriate</b> camera <b>motion,</b> recognition and recognition timing can be learned only from the reward and punishment through Actor-Q learning.

40|$|AbstractSpoken dialog {{system is}} one of the most useful {{interface}} between human and machine. These systems need scenario data, which is represented by Finite State Transducer (FST). It is usually written by hand, but making it is a time-consuming job. In order to make a dialog scenario file easily, a new dialog scenario editor is developed. In dialog systems, it is important for natural communication that an agent speaks with natural gesture. However, it is difficult to make an <b>appropriate</b> <b>motion</b> for every utterance in a dialog scenario. In this paper, automatic motion assignment method is proposed. Most of motions have some meanings, and these meanings correspond to some keywords. Relationship between motions and keywords are investigated in advance, and an <b>appropriate</b> <b>motion</b> is selected based on corresponding keyword list. Moreover, the proposed motion selection method also considers sentence styles (interrogative, negative, and so on) of the main phrase in the sentence. Naturalness evaluation experiment was carried out for combinations between motions and utterances, and motion selection rules (keyword list and conditions) were made based on the results. Totally 83 keywords were listed for 31 motions. The performance of the motion selection method was evaluated. From this experiment, only 13. 3 % of input sentences were given an <b>appropriate</b> <b>motion.</b> However, many errors could be corrected by modifying the motion selection rules, and finally 80. 0 % of assigned motions were evaluated as “appropriate. ”The dialog scenario editor with automatic motion assignment was developed.

40|$|Motion {{synthesis}} is {{the process}} of automatically generating visually plausible motions that meet goal criteria specified by a human animator. The objects whose motions are synthesized are often animated characters that are modeled as articulated figures or massspring lattices. Controller synthesis is a technique for motion synthesis that involves searching in a space of possible controllers to generate <b>appropriate</b> <b>motions.</b> Recently, automatic controllersynthesis techniques for 2 D articulated figures have been reported. An open question is whether these techniques can be generalized to work for 3 D animated characters. In this paperwe report successful automatic controller synthesis for 3 D articulated figures and massspring models that are subject to nonholonomic constraints. These results show that the 3 D motion-synthesis problem can be solved in some challenging cases, though much work on this general topic remains to be done.

In this paper, an auto-regressive (AR) model based error concealment scheme is proposed for stereoscopic video coding to address the challenging problem. The proposed error concealment scheme includes a temporal AR model for independent view, and a temporal-interview AR model for inter-view predicted view. First, <b>appropriate</b> <b>motions</b> and disparities for lost blocks are derived. Then, the proposed AR model coefficients are computed according to the spatial neighboring pixels and their temporal-correlated and interview-correlated pixels indicated by the selected prediction directions.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{intuitive}} animation interface {{that uses a}} foot pressure sensor pad to interactively control avatars for video games, virtual reality, and low-cost performance-driven animation. During an offline training phase, we capture full body motions with a motion capture system, {{as well as the}} corresponding foot-ground pressure distributions with a pressure sensor pad, into a database. At run time, the user acts out the animation desired on the pressure sensor pad. The system then tries to “see ” the motion only through the foot-ground interactions measured, and the most <b>appropriate</b> <b>motions</b> from the database are selected, and edited online to drive the avatar. We describe our motion recognition, motion blending, and inverse kinematics algorithms in detail. They are easy to implement, and cheap to compute. FootSee can control a virtual avatar in a fixed latency of 1 second with reasonable accuracy. Our system thus makes it possible to create interactive animations without the cost or inconveniences of a full body motion capture system.

In the proposed method, the probability density functions of recorded data are estimated through learning involving a probabilistic neural network based on the KL information theory. Partial KL information is defined to support evaluation of the contribution of each dimension and class for classification. Effective dimensions and classes can then be selected by eliminating ineffective choices one by one based on this information, respectively. In the experiments, effective channels for classification were first selected {{for each of the}} six subjects, and the number of channels was reduced by 32. 1 ± 25. 5 %.

A dynamic programming algorithm can then be used to interpret an input control specification in terms of mapping instances. This interpretation induces a sequence of target segments from the database, which is concatenated to create the <b>appropriate</b> target <b>motion.</b> The method is evaluated on two examples of indirect control.
