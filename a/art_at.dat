Stoddart associates the lack of form in modern art with social decay; in contrast, his works include many classical allusions.|$|E

5|$|A precise {{description}} {{and interpretation of}} the work has remained elusive since its initial discovery in the 19th century. Scholars agree on some aspects and disagree on others. British Greek art scholar Martin Robertson notes that both women can be seen wearing the tubular peplos garment common to the Classical period. According to the descriptive text found in the Atlas database of the exhibited works of <b>art</b> <b>at</b> the Louvre, the women also are wearing a kekryphalos, a hairnet in the Greco-Roman hairstyle, and appear to hold a type of flower, perhaps poppy or pomegranate. One {{of the women in}} the stele carries what resembles a bag, presumed to be carrying seeds in the interpretation.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of the Pocket PC version, in 2006 Chahi created a new Windows version {{targeted}} at Windows XP. Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds. He found that his original choice to use polygons for the game characters enabled him to use the original character <b>art</b> <b>at</b> a higher resolution. The game still supports the original 320×200 resolution, as well as the original background art (as an option), and it features twice as many checkpoints as the original, which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.|$|E

5|$|Directed by Bo Johan Renck, the {{accompanying}} music video was filmed at Ealing Studios in London on 17 August 2000.
