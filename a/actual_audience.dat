2500|$|It is {{difficult}} to apply [...] "feelings" [...] {{as a basis for}} constraining speech as they are inherently subjective and difficult to measure. Furthermore, section 3(1)(e) is silent as to which audience a tendency should be evaluated by– the <b>actual</b> <b>audience</b> or an audience of [...] "reasonable persons". The same deed may produce different [...] "feelings" [...] depending on the temperament of the audience, as [...] "language which would be innocuous, practically speaking if used to an assembly of professors or divines, might produce a different result if used before an excited audience of young and uneducated men". Due to such ambiguity, people are left without clear guidelines as to what constitutes a seditious tendency, which may result in the chilling of free speech.|$|E
40|$|In {{rhetoric and}} argumentation {{research}} studies of empirical audiences are rare. Most studies are speaker- or text focussed. However, new media and {{new forms of}} communication {{make it harder to}} distinguish between speaker and audience. The active involvement of users and audiences is more important than ever before. Therefore, this paper argues that rhetorical research should reconsider the understanding, conceptualization and examination of the rhetorical audience. From mostly understanding audiences as theoretical constructions that are examined textually and speculatively, we should give more attention to empirical explorations of <b>actual</b> <b>audiences</b> and users...|$|R
40|$|Journalists {{domesticate}} {{news about}} distant events to bring such events {{closer to the}} audience and thus make them more relevant and appealing; however, knowledge about the <b>actual</b> <b>audience’s</b> reactions towards domesticated news is lacking. Central to this study is understanding how an audience makes use of domestication strategies in viewing and reacting to mediated distant suffering. Earlier text-based research has found several ways of domesticating distant suffering that can invite an audience to care (Joye, 2015). Building further on this media-centered study, ten focus groups reveal a two-flow model of domestication, consisting of first-level domestication on the production side by journalists and second-level domestication, in which audience members themselves use strategies of domestication {{to make sense of}} distant suffering...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} recent scholarly attempts {{to revisit the}} Christian theme of redemption by making various uses of Frank Darabont’s 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption. I indicate that, while the appropriation of this film has generated much insightful theology, {{there has been an}} insufficient regard for the extent to which ‘redemption’ is a diverse and heterogeneous term which is not intrinsically transferable beyond the specific contours of the Christian faith. I suggest that a new way of doing theology through film is needed. As an alternative to hijacking the film for theological purposes, my premise is that the most judicious way of entering into conversation with the film is to pay particular attention to what <b>actual</b> <b>audiences</b> are saying about it, and from that point seeing what sort of theological encounter – if any – is able to be facilitated...|$|R
40|$|By {{examining}} {{the process of}} production and reception {{of the works of}} Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde, this thesis explores the ways in which both conceptions of <b>audience</b> and <b>actual</b> <b>audiences</b> shaped these works. As proponents of "aestheticism," a philosophy which required the development of a highly specialised mode of perception and critical awareness, Pater and Wilde wrote with a fairly select audience in mind. Confronted, however, with actual readers who did not always meet the "aesthetic" criteria (even if they were supporters), they were forced to rethink their conceptions of audience. Pater's and Wilde's developing understandings of audience can be traced in their works, as they experiment with style and genre in an attempt to communicate effectively with their readers. Although at base Pater and Wilde advocated a similar "aesthetic" philosophy, their distinct conceptions of audience {{played a significant role in}} determining the nature of their particular versions of aestheticism...|$|R

40|$|Exploring the synergies between {{audiovisual}} translation, cognitive (experimental) pragmatics {{and film}} studies, {{the present article}} proposes a novel approach to the empirical investigation of audience reception. The proposed methodology is applied to {{a study on the}} comprehension of implicatures by British and Greek viewers in the two Bridget Jones films Bridget Jones’s Diary (2001) and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (2004) and their subtitled versions. Inter alia, it is demonstrated that implicatures whose understanding presupposes familiarity with specific aspects of the British culture presented the Greek audience with substantial difficulties. Overall, experimental data analysis shows that source and target viewers did not always understand implicatures in the way the filmmakers would like them to and/or the analyst had predicted. This finding highlights the subjectivity and creativity of audience response and, therefore, the need regularly to corroborate research hypotheses through studies of <b>actual</b> <b>audiences...</b>|$|R
40|$|The article {{studies the}} {{interaction}} between Oliver Williamson and his audiences {{in the construction of}} Transaction Cost Economics (TCE). His attentiveness to the feedback from different groups has {{played a major role in}} the success of TCE. First we discuss briefly the relevance of rhetoric to the study of economics. Rhetoric stresses that economists talk not to a void, but to peers and lay people with their habits, interests, institutional conditionings and values. Using the toolbox of rhetoric we identify Williamson’s intended audiences. Next we discuss his lists of claimed antecedents and the changes made therein. We explore how those (changing) connections could possibly have incited different audiences. In what follows, we use citation data to delineate his actual readers. This helps compare intended and <b>actual</b> <b>audiences</b> as we close with a discussion of Williamson’s ability to modify his intended reader and widen the audience of TCE in the social sciences. ...|$|R

He has also written extensively on film theories (Theories of Cinema. 1945-1995, Texas, 1999, or. 1993). More recently he explored the role of cinema {{in the context of}} modernity (Eye of the Century.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a complex and}} in-depth analysis of the reception, by <b>actual</b> <b>audiences,</b> of recent films about the Holocaust. Drawing on approaches from cultural studies, and using an original methodology developed for this project, the analysis of film text and context was combined with an empirical, qualitative reception study. Using Britain as a case study, it is demonstrated that the reception process of feature films and docu-dramas about the Holocaust is multi-faceted and cannot be fully understood through textual analysis alone. The thesis challenges the widespread generalisations about films’ alleged impact on ‘the public’ in the literature about Holocaust representations. By analysing the data, {{the ways in which}} a select number of films are made sense of immediately after the film viewing are explored, and how the Holocaust is understood through these films. It is demonstrated that the reading of films is simultaneously multiple and emanating from the text, which triggers and facilitates a range of interpretations. The process of making sense of Holocaust representations is an active process, which is influenced, guided and at times constrained by preconceptions, emotions, {{and the extent to which}} films are considered as authentic. As such, the thesis makes a long overdue contribution to the study of the representation of the Holocaust...|$|R

40|$|Professor Lauri Thurén, PhD (theology), is {{a leading}} expert in rhetorical and {{argumentative}} studies of the New Testament. He is Professor of Biblical Studies at the University of Eastern Finland. His major publications include Parables Unplugged: Reading the Lukan Parables in Their Rhetorical Context (Fortress Press, 2014), Derhetorizing Paul: A Dynamic Perspective on Pauline Theology and the Law (Mohr Siebeck 2000), and Argument and Theology in 1 Peter: The Origins of Christian Paraenesis (Sheffield Academic Press, 1995). Currently, Thurén is interested in studying the parables of Jesus from a literary and rhetorical- perspective. Jesus’ antagonistic encounters with the Pharisees serve traditionally {{as a basis for}} the poor relationship between Christianity and Judaism. The conflict stories epitomized by Jesus’ parables have been assessed as descriptions of how he either justifiably revealed his adversaries’ falseness or falsely defamed them. These stories are used to justify later religious conflicts. I shall argue that the traditional anti-Pharisaic interpretations of Jesus’ parables have an inadequate basis in the actual stories. Instead, they are due to two axiomatic perspectives that dominate the interpretation: ill-fitting allegorical explanations and/or the search for some historical context. Both approaches have resulted in manipulating the parables, either by curtailing them or by importing into them information of which their <b>actual</b> <b>audience(s)</b> were unaware...|$|R

40|$|As a Japanese {{cultural}} genre, animated {{works for}} girls serve as sociocultural texts which articulate hegemonic social norms and ideologies regarding gender in Japanese society. This thesis aims to critically examine representations of 'magical girl' protagonists in Jpanese Magical Girl TV animation programmes (anime) for girls from 1966 to 2003, and to analyse female audiences' viewing experiences {{and understanding of}} those programmes {{in relation to the}} context of sociocultural and feminist movements in Japan. By using a combined methodology of close textual analysis of six Magical Girl TV anime and of qualitative research, in which individual interviews with female audiences and a focus group discussion among girl audiences were conducted, this thesis explores how representations of Western-oriented witches and witchcraft in the Magical Girl TV anime facilitated constructions of female gender identity and idealised 'self' and how <b>actual</b> female <b>audiences</b> in three different age cohorts understood, took pleasure in, consumed, negotiated, resonated with and/or reconciled with those representations. Although Japanese witch animation texts articulated Japanese normative moral values and hegemonic femininity as well as ideal gender equality, they served as sites in which female audiences took pleasure in constructing an ideal 'self' and self-assertion through negotiating, resonating and reconciling with Western-oriented fashionable female protagonists and their lifestyle, and attaining self-expression through 'textual poaching' or exercising imagined magical transformations in an all-female or solitary environment. This thesis attempts to contribute to uncovering little-explored but important Japanese cultural texts of Magical Girl TV anime and explicate the way in which <b>actual</b> Japanese <b>audiences</b> responded to this gender-segregated genre of Japanese TV anime...|$|R

The implied {{audience is}} not the <b>actual</b> <b>audience,</b> but the {{one that can be}} inferred by reading or analyzing the text. Communications scholar Edwin Black, in his essay, The Second Persona, presents the theoretical concept of the implied audience using the idea of two personae. The first persona is the implied rhetoric (the idea of the speaker formed by the audience) and the second persona is the implied audience (the idea of the audience formed by and utilized for persuasion in the speech situation). A critic could also determine what the text wants that audience to become or do after the rhetorical situation.|$|E
40|$|The Accidental Audience {{considers}} how media organizations {{construct and}} respond to audience members that {{are not part of}} the intended audience for a particular media product. Focusing on public service and commercial children’s television, this thesis explores how the increasing reliance on audience research and audience profiling, generating ideas of a constructed intended audience, can often oversimplify the unpredictable, messy and complex reality of television audiences. This thesis draws on critical work about industry conceptions of media audiences, notably the work of Philip Napoli, to develop a framework for conceptualizing the accidental audience. This focuses on the discrepancy between intended and <b>actual</b> <b>audiences</b> in the form of unexpected viewerships for (children’s) television programmes. Examining the television industry’s conceptualisation of audiences through the development of the TV ratings system, this thesis considers a series of case studies which introduce and utilise the model of the accidental audience. Specifically this thesis examines adult audiences of programming created for children, including the Brony audience (men aged 18 - 45) of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (2010 -), the student audience of Teletubbies (1997 - 2001), and the non-parent audience of Sesame Street (1969 -). In critical terms, this thesis explores how the television industry has responded in different ways to accidental audiences and examines the strategies used by the television industry to manage these audiences. My focus is on the dynamic relation between studios/networks and accidental audiences and how media industries navigate unexpected audience constituencies, and the overall aim of the project is to advance knowledge of the negotiations that take place between screen industries and audiences...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{offers the}} first full-length study of medieval England’s literary tradition of manuals for penitents—texts describing the sins, and other essentials of the faith, that address penitents preparing for confession. This tradition includes works that {{were among the}} most popular in medieval England. Some of these—including the Parson’s Tale and Ancrene Wisse, which is an important precursor to this body of writing—have been studied in depth, but the tradition in which they participate is still not well understood. This dissertation shows that this tradition emerged in a significant way {{in the second half of}} the thirteenth century, although it took root in an existing body of self-examination writing. Insofar as it reflects a new emphasis on reading as a means of interrogating oneself rather than as a means of preparing oneself to interrogate others, the development of these manuals represents a widening range of reading practices and a shift toward private confessional education. The first two chapters describe the characteristics of manuals for penitents, including their material and formal qualities. Among other contributions, the first chapter explores a feature of commentaries on the essentials of the faith that often goes unnoticed: that when they appear in manuals for penitents, they are not, as is often thought, digressive, impersonal, or strictly didactic, but instead encourage and promote self-reflection. The second chapter examines the implied and <b>actual</b> <b>audiences</b> of manuals for penitents. On the basis of this more precise characterization of these manuals, the final three chapters offer insight into three interlinked texts chosen from different stages of the development of these manuals: Ancrene Wisse, the Compileison, and the Parson’s Tale. In addition to shedding light on these three texts, these concluding chapters highlight some of the tensions that emerged surrounding the shift to asynchronous penitential learning that was enabled by these manuals...|$|R
