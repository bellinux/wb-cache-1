Whether for good or for evil, woman was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> Jasper Perry's heart and affairs. The cause of his journey was love; the aim and end of it was marriage!

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} needs society has in 2012 is addressing {{the plight of the}} 4 billion people, globally, who live <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic pyramid. Unless initiatives are undertaken to alleviate poverty and hardship in this portion of society, human potential will be wasted and the economic burden on the rest of society to support them will remain significant. In South Africa a significant portion of <b>the</b> population live <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid. One initiative to alleviate poverty and hardship is to enable <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid people who are excluded from formal financial services to access to them. By accessing formal financial services {{they would be able to}} safely save and borrow money. They would also be able to escape exploitative informal financial practices. Technology has the potential to expand access to financial services and reduce the cost of service provision. To date, however, it has not delivered on its promise of expanding financial inclusion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid. Intermediaries, too, have been used to increase access to financial services but have also not successfully expanded financial inclusion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid. Understanding which factors would allow these approaches to realize their potential has the ability to meaningfully contribute to addressing the plight <b>of</b> people <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid. This study brings together the potential of technology and the role of intermediaries to model expanding financial inclusion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid in South Africa. The Technology Acceptance Model is used as a basis to propose an extended TAM model that explains adoption of technology enabled financial services through an intermediary <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid in South Africa. The proposed model is validated using structural equation modelling with data collected in a national survey in South Africa. The extended TAM model successfully explains more than 90 % of the behavioural intention of financially excluded people <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid to adopt financial services through an intermediary. Using the findings, a strategic approach to expanding financial inclusion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid is proposed.

5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Vlasic played college {{football}} at the University of Iowa. For four years, {{he served as a}} backup to Chuck Long, now a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. During his junior year, as the backup quarterback, he also served as the holder for field goal kicks. After placekicker Rob Houghtlin won a 12-10 game against the University of Michigan thanks to a last second field goal, a mob tore down the goalpost, which injured four fans including Vlasic, who was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pile of fans.|$|E
5|$|Four {{hundred million}} years ago, California lay <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large sea; {{underwater}} volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the sea floor. By tectonic forces these minerals and rocks came {{to the surface of}} the Sierra Nevada, and eroded. Water carried the exposed gold downstream and deposited it in quiet gravel beds along the sides of old rivers and streams. The forty-niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury {{went missing}} while in France, {{prompting}} an international police investigation. His remains were found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> remote ravine {{in the foothills}} of the French Alps five months after his death. Investigations revealed that he was murdered by his brother-in-law during an argument regarding a divorce from his wife, Jamila M'Barek, both of whom were convicted of his murder.|$|E

5|$|On Tuesday, April 29, Black went to Lee's {{residence}} at 11a.m. looking for evidence, {{and found a}} blood-smeared shirt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> burn barrel. The blood was smeared {{high up on the}} armpits and the shirt smelled unused, suggesting to the police that it was a plant. The detectives, suspicious of Frank due to his nervous behavior throughout his interviews, believed that Frank had arranged the plant.|$|E
5|$|The Pine Bush {{is home to}} bog {{bluegrass}} (Poa paludigena), {{a federal}} species of concern, {{as well as the}} rare red-rooted flatsedge (Cyperus erythrorhizos), Houghton's umbrella-sedge (Cyperus houghtonii), and Schweinitz's flatsedge (Cyperus schweinitzii). Bog bluegrass occurs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ravine in the Pine Bush and is {{the only place in the}} New York Bight watershed where this plant appears. Bayard's malaxis (Malaxis bayardii) is a rare orchid that occurs in the Pine Bush as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} an {{individual}} – signified by the tolling of the bell – is thus a treasure buried <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mine: only of value if it is given to someone who makes good use of it. In this he refers {{to the work of}} Augustine of Hippo, specifically On Christian Doctrine, in which Augustine describes the knowledge of pagans as gold and silver: something that can be involved in Christian purposes if appropriated properly. Donne, twisting this idea, is arguing that the {{death of an}}y individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it properly.|$|E

5|$|During warmer weather, {{the wood}} turtle {{stays in the}} water for a larger {{percentage}} of the time. For this reason, during the winter months (and the late fall and early spring) it is considered an aquatic turtle. November through February or March is spent in hibernation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small, flowing river. The wood turtle may hibernate alone or in large groups. During this period, individuals bury themselves in the thick mud {{at the bottom of the}} river and rarely move. During hibernation, it is vulnerable to flash floods. Emergence does not occur until March or sometimes April, months that mark the beginning of its activation period (males are typically more active than females at this time).|$|E
5|$|Elwell {{advanced}} inland {{rapidly and}} was soon also engaged, losing one killed and two wounded in a brief skirmish. During the advance the Australians had also uncovered and defused a large pipe mine the Germans had buried under a narrow track and set to detonate using a command wire. These mines had been laid beneath the road with wires leading to an electric battery and a firing key <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lookout tree. By 13:00 however, Hill's position was reached and the Australians—now under Elwell's overall command—launched another flanking attack on the main trench blocking the road. Despite suffering heavy casualties they pressed their attack, forcing the defenders to surrender after charging the trench with fixed bayonets. A German officer and 20Melanesians were captured. Four Australians were killed, including Elwell who died leading the charge with his sword drawn, and another five were wounded.|$|E
5|$|In January 1855, Brontë {{discovered}} she was pregnant. It {{was accompanied by}} severe illness and she died on 31 March 1855, officially from tuberculosis. Mr. Nicholls remained with Brontë's father for a further six years before returning to Banagher in 1861, taking with him his wife's portrait, her wedding dress (of which a copy has been made), some of Charlotte's letters and other mementoes. Forty years later, when the critic Clement Shorter prepared to write Charlotte Brontë and Her Circle, he found at Banagher among other relics, two diaries of Emily and Anne, in a tin box, and some of Charlotte's minute childhood writings wrapped in newspaper <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drawer.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team assembles, boards two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and {{heads toward the}} location without gunship escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert the arriving forces, the Taliban insurgents shoot {{down one of the}} helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators who were on board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rock crevice where he is able to hide from the Taliban fighters.|$|E
5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors {{up and down on the}} rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{expected}} a reaction so {{he moved with}} 15,000 of his own men to defeat Ali Pasha's army. The two met in the Plain of Torvioll where they camped opposite of each other. The following day, 29 June, Ali {{came out of his}} camp and saw that Skanderbeg had positioned his forces <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hill. Expecting a quick victory, Ali ordered all of his forces down the hill to attack and defeat Skanderbeg's army. Skanderbeg expected such a maneuver and had prepared his own stratagem. Once the opposing forces were engaged and the necessary positioning was achieved, Skanderbeg ordered his forces hidden in the forests behind the Turkish army to strike their rear. The result was devastating for the Ottomans, whose entire army was routed and its commander nearly killed.|$|E
