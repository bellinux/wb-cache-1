50|$|The {{most common}} method for <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> is {{fractional}} distillation. Cryogenic <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> <b>units</b> (ASUs) are built to provide nitrogen or oxygen and often co-produce argon. Other {{methods such as}} membrane, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA), are commercially used to separate a single component from ordinary air. High purity oxygen, nitrogen, and argon used for semiconductor device fabrication requires cryogenic distillation. Similarly, the only viable sources of the rare gases neon, krypton, and xenon is the distillation of air using at least two distillation columns.|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of growing energy demand and expanded use of fossil fuels, CO 2 level in the atmosphere has risen {{in the last couple}} of centuries. The principal effect of these anthropologic emissions of greenhouse gases is global warming. In the last years, there has been much effort on finding a long term solution to this problem, mostly based on clean power technologies. In order to reduce green-house gas emissions different technologies to capture CO 2 are under investigation. One of the most promising technologies is oxy-combustion using ITM (ion transport membranes) used in <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> <b>units</b> or integrated directly in reactors. This work presents a model for the integration of dense oxygen membrane modules in <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> <b>units.</b> An axially resolved model for the distribution of oxygen concentration is developed, incorporating a model of the oxygen flux across membrane surface and its dependency on the local conditions, which satisfies the conservation equations of mass and energy. The oxygen flux model is based on accurate experimental measurements and incorporates the effects of chemistry at the surface and diffusion in the bulk material, as well as heat and mass transport on the feed and sweep side...|$|R

According to the latest literatures, an energy saving of 39. 1 % is achieved compared with those using conventional double-column <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> <b>units.</b> The introduction of LNG cold energy is an effective way to increase the system efficiency...|$|R
50|$|Air {{separation}} plants refine air in {{a separation}} process and so allow the bulk production of nitrogen and argon in addition to oxygen - these three are often also produced as cryogenic liquid. To achieve the required low distillation temperatures, an <b>Air</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Unit</b> (ASU) uses a refrigeration cycle that operates {{by means of the}} Joule-Thomson effect. In addition to the main air gases, air separation is also the only practical source for production of the rare noble gases neon, krypton and xenon.|$|E
50|$|The Fischer-Tropsch process {{starts with}} partial {{oxidation}} of methane (natural gas) to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen gas and water. The ratio {{of carbon monoxide}} to hydrogen is adjusted using the water gas shift reaction, while the excess carbon dioxide is removed with aqueous solutions of alkanolamines (or physical solvents). Removing the water yields synthesis gas (syngas) which is chemically reacted over an iron or cobalt catalyst to produce liquid hydrocarbons and other byproducts. Oxygen is provided from a cryogenic <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the cost}} of CO2 {{emissions}} avoided through Ca-looping is lower than {{the cost of}} emissions avoided via an oxyfuel combustion process (~$23.8USD/t). This {{can be explained by the}} fact that, despite the capital costs incurred in constructing the carbonator for Ca-looping, CO2 will not only be captured from the oxy-fired combustion, but also from the main combustor (before the carbonator). The oxygen required in the calciners is only 1/3 that required for an oxyfuel process, lowering <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> <b>unit</b> capital costs and operating costs.|$|E

50|$|Capture Power Limited is {{composed}} of three major European companies: Alstom, Drax Group, and The BOC Group.

50|$|Unlike the {{combined}} cycle, the Allam cycle requires an <b>air</b> <b>separation</b> <b>unit,</b> {{to supply the}} cycle with oxygen. On the other hand, {{there is no need}} for large-scale external cooling, there is only one turbine, and small components can be used, as the system operates at high pressures and thus high power densities. Complete Allam cycle power stations can therefore be smaller than combined cycle stations, even before adding the considerable size of carbon dioxide capture equipment. This potentially makes the capital costs for the Allam cycle lower than for {{the combined}} cycle at equivalent capacities. Other advantages include the complete absence of nitrogen oxide in the waste, and for stations located in dry environments, the integrated generation of water.|$|E

In this paper, we linearize a convection-diffusion model inspired from wave-models, in the case of vanishing diffusion. We obtain a linear transfer model which is explicitly parameterized with the usual column's operating parameters. This model consists in gains and pure delays only. It is derived from an unusual asymptotic expansion (Laurent series with exponentially precise terms) versus the diffusion coefficient.
