The church contains <b>a</b> <b>stained</b> glass window dedicated to Aldenham, and a Book of Remembrance is displayed {{in front of the}} stained glass window, along with a White Ensign.

5|$|Several {{works of}} art bear her likeness. In 1935, Michalina Mościcka, wife of Polish President Ignacy Mościcki, {{unveiled}} a statue of Marie Curie before Warsaw's Radium Institute. During the 1944 Second World War Warsaw Uprising against the Nazi German occupation, the monument was damaged by gunfire; after the war {{it was decided to}} leave the bullet marks on the statue and its pedestal. In 1955 Jozef Mazur created <b>a</b> <b>stained</b> glass panel of her, the Maria Skłodowska-Curie Medallion, featured in the University at Buffalo Polish Room.|$|E

5|$|The chapel's {{iconography}} pays tribute {{in places}} {{to the other}} Abrahamic religions. Abraham himself is depicted in <b>a</b> <b>stained</b> glass window {{on the north side}} of the nave, together with a Star of David, a Christian cross, and a star and crescent. Other windows show Baruch Spinoza and Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi; both images were planned before the chapel was built.|$|E
5|$|The {{mausoleum}} {{over the}} grave was erected in 1901. His wife purchased eleven plots adjoining the family plot {{to accommodate the}} structure. The building has massive marble columns in the front with a heavy metal door; on the back above the sarcophagus is <b>a</b> <b>stained</b> glass window. There are two sarcophagi {{in the center of}} the building, for Garret Hobart and his wife. Around the tomb are niches for other members of the family. At the time of construction in 1901, the mausoleum cost about $80,000.|$|E
5|$|There is also <b>a</b> <b>stained</b> {{glass window}} showing a saint {{with a sword}} {{standing}} on a snake and crossed flags, commemorating those from World War II. Several other stained glass windows date from the Victorian era. The window in the tower was donated by a London goldsmith named Mattheson to commemorate the rebuilding {{of the church in}} 1863. The east window represents events in the life of Saint Andrew.|$|E

5|$|In {{the church}} are bronze plaques commemorating the eleven local {{people who died}} in World War I and the six {{who were killed in}} World War II. There is also <b>a</b> <b>stained</b> glass window showing a saint with a sword {{standing}} on a snake, and crossed flags commemorating those from World War II. There is also a memorial plaque to the local Bilbie family of bell founders and clockmakers inside the church, and just inside the porch, on the left of the church door, is a stone figure holding an anchor, which was moved to the church from Walley Court with the flooding of the lake. There is an unconfirmed story that this was given to the Gilbert family, then living at the court, by Queen ElizabethI.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the building were revamped to accommodate an open layout suitable for a department store. Non-structural interior walls were torn down. A new atrium was created by constructing a wall on the second storey, and {{could be used as}} an exhibition hall. A four-storey high waterfall was built {{at the back of the}} building, which has a new three-storey extension. <b>A</b> <b>stained</b> glass skylight was used as an interface to join the old and new parts of the building. New escalators and lifts were added to serve all six floors of the building. As a result, total floor space was increased from 3,700 to 4,600 square metres (39,800 to 49,500 square feet), with 4,650 square metres (50,000 square feet) of retail space created for use by the store.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1925, Pflueger {{designed}} a , 28-story, step-back skyscraper made of brick framed with steel, {{along the lines}} of his just-completed Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company Building. Its main decorative theme was neo-Gothic, expressed strongly in the three Gothic arches which formed the main street-level entrance for the church. The Great Hall, the large worship area located within the second, third and fourth floors was to seat 1,500 churchgoers and a smaller chapel was designed for 125 more. A grand pipe organ from Skinner Organ Company was installed with four manuals controlling 3,881 pipes. <b>A</b> <b>stained</b> glass window was placed 80 feet above the sanctuary, representing Faith, Love and Hope in three tall, narrow panels. Two assembly halls could be combined to hold 1,100 attendees for theatrical or athletic events. Some 500 guest rooms and 32 tower apartments were intended to bring a steady flow of visitors and a source of profit to the church. Though never the tallest building in San Francisco, it was to be the tallest hotel on the Pacific Coast for many decades.|$|E

5|$|S. Sivasekaram's 1980 Tamil poem Ahalikai {{examines}} the stone motif in Ahalya's tale: she marries {{a husband who}} is no more interested in her than a stone and briefly encounters joy with Indra, only to end up cursed to become a lifeless stone. The poet asks if it was better for Ahalya to remain physically a stone and retain her dignity rather than return to a stony marriage. Uyir Maga ("Life-woman") by the Tamil poet Na. Pichamurthy (1900–76) presents Ahalya as an allegorical representation of life, with Gautama as the mind and Indra pleasure. The Marxist critic Kovai Gnani, in his poem Kallihai, represents Ahalya as the oppressed class and Rama as an ideal future without exploitation. Gautama and Indra represent feudalism and capitalism. The character of Ahalya played by Kamala Kotnis in the 1949 movie Sati Ahalya ("chaste Ahalya") was described as still relevant by contemporary film critics due to its portrayal of the predicament of <b>a</b> <b>stained</b> woman.|$|E
5|$|The Victorian period {{witnessed}} extensive restoration work at Quarrington. Most of the nave's {{windows were}} altered, and the chancel {{and part of}} the vestry were rebuilt by Charles Kirk in 1862–63, who also widened the chancel arch. Parts of the tower and spire were remodelled 24 years later. The Census of Religious Worship (1851) reveals that the Church had room for 120 people, attendances of 20 and 40 in the morning and afternoon respectively and 20 Sunday scholars. As Sleaford expanded, houses were built along London and Station Roads, pushing the town inside the Quarrington parish boundaries in what became New Quarrington. To deal with the growing population, a second church was designed in the early 1900s on donated land in the parish, to be built closer to Sleaford. Disruption during the First World War, parish boundary changes in 1928, and rising costs delayed the plans. Instead a church hall was built in 1932 on Grantham Road and as of 2009 was being used as a community centre. An extension to the Church was added in 2001, providing a kitchen, accessible toilet and other facilities; built in matching stone, it incorporated <b>a</b> <b>stained</b> glass window from the north aisle.|$|E
5|$|The Village {{was almost}} {{completely}} self-contained, {{with its own}} shops, public hall, post office, police station, school, social club, and sports facilities. Three corrugated iron churches were built: a Methodist chapel in 1901, St Cuthberts (Church of England) in 1902, and the Roman Catholic St Antony's in 1904. St Cuthbert's was subsequently replaced by a brick building, but closed in 1982. Only St Antony's remains open; it contains the altar and <b>a</b> <b>stained</b> glass window from the chapel at Trafford Hall, donated by Lady Annette de Trafford. The Village's design attracted criticism from the start; the streets were narrow, with few gardens, and the whole development {{was close to the}} pollution of the neighbouring industries. In that respect it resembled the terraced properties in the surrounding areas, many of which were condemned as slums in later years. By the 1970s The Village was also considered by Stretford Council to be a slum area, and unsuitable for residential housing. In the first phase of clearance, during the mid-1970s, 298houses were demolished. A further 325 houses were demolished in the early 1980s, leaving only the largest 84 houses remaining.|$|E
