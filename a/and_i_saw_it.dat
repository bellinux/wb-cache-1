5|$|If it {{had gone}} by me, it's a two-on-one. So I got a little lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and when I got the pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really {{trying to get the}} puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> go in, so I jumped.|$|E
5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
2500|$|You know, {{its engine}} sound was {{different}} from other planes; that is, the president's engine's sound ... We were looking towards where the plane was coming from, and we saw a projectile and we saw a ball of flame or flash and we saw the plane go down; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> I {{was the leader of}} the bloc so I asked the soldiers to get up and I told them [...] "Get up because Kinani [...] has been shot down.' They told me, [...] "You are lying." [...] I said, [...] "It's true." [...] So I opened my wardrobe, I put on my uniform and I heard the bugle sound.|$|E

60|$|TANNER. [Smiting his brow] How frightfully, horribly true! It {{has been}} staring {{me in the}} face all my life; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> before.|$|R

2500|$|Hartford Courant {{music critic}} Roger Catlin {{has said that}} the album's appeal is limited to aficionados of [...] "early {{synthesizer}} experiments". Malcolm Cecil, who {{went on to become a}} leading synthesizer proponent as the co-creator of TONTO, recalls that when he first encountered a Moog 3P, his immediate thought was: [...] "Geez, this is the [...] that George Harrison made that record on. I'm looking at it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> has filters, envelope generator – what the hell is all this stuff?" [...] Tom Rowlands of the Chemical Brothers has cited Electronic Sound as an influence. In his introduction to the 2014 CD booklet, he recalls discovering a rare copy of the LP in a Tokyo record shop in the 1990s and says that the sleeve [...] "now hangs on the wall of my studio, just next to my own Moog modular, beaming inspiration straight to my brain".|$|E
2500|$|In July 2005, {{representatives of}} Juventus met with Arsenal {{with a view}} to signing Vieira. The player, {{according}} to The Guardian, accepted that Arsenal were [...] "ready to let him go" [...] before agreeing in principle to join Juventus. On 15 August 2005, Vieira signed a five-year contract, in a deal worth £13.75 million. In a later interview with the Daily Mail, Wenger explained the departure of Vieira was to serve Cesc Fàbregas' career: [...] "When Cesc Fàbregas was 18, 19, I would play him in a 4–4–2 with Patrick Vieira <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> did not work. Then I had the decision to make about letting Patrick go, because Gilberto Silva and Vieira worked, Fàbregas and Silva worked, but I could not play Fàbregas and Vieira. But Fàbregas was 19 and if he did not play I knew he would want to go, so we risked destroying everything, all the work we had put into this player." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Symington {{revealed}} he was {{a witness}} to the Phoenix Lights, a mass UFO sighting that took place on March 13, 1997, a decade before his admission. In an interview with The Daily Courier, Symington stated, [...] "I'm a pilot and I know just about every machine that flies. It was bigger than anything that I've ever seen. It remains a great mystery. Other people saw it, responsible people. I don't know why people would ridicule it." [...] He continued, [...] "It was enormous and inexplicable. Who knows where it came from? A lot of people saw it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> too. It was dramatic. And it couldn't have been flares because it was too symmetrical. It had a geometric outline, a constant shape." [...] As Governor during the Phoenix Lights, Symington stated he would investigate the event, but went on to hold a press conference where he had his chief of staff dress up in an alien costume. He later stated that as a public official he felt a responsibility to avert public panic and therefore made an attempt to introduce some levity into the situation.|$|E

6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>it</b> {{was indeed}} himself--but how aged and wan! And {{never before had}} I heard him mention his brother. Much shocked; I murmured: [...] "Oh! I am sorry!" ...|$|R

60|$|They were Lorenzo's own lines, and he {{was delighted}} that I should quote them, but still the {{pleasure}} was not too great, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>it</b> must be subtle flattery indeed that should turn his head.|$|R

60|$|The {{next thing}} I found {{was a piece}} of chalk; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>it</b> all the art and all the frescoes of the world. The next was a coin of a very modest value; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>it</b> not only the image and superscription of our own Caesar, but all {{government}} and order since the world began. But I have not space to say what were the items in the long and splendid procession of poetical symbols that came pouring out. I cannot tell you all the things that were in my pocket. I can tell you one thing, however, that I could not find in my pocket. I allude to my railway ticket.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went with}} her myself to the early train; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> leave the station." [...] And Olive kept her eyes unaverted, for the {{satisfaction}} of seeing how he took it.|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> {{was filled}} with graves, [...] And tombstones where flowers should be; And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds, [...] And binding with briars my joys and desires.|$|E
60|$|The man laughed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> was Thorn, though I did {{not know}} then that after doing my work and his own during the day he had watched {{the greater part of}} every night beside me.|$|E
60|$|His cheeks flushed, and his {{expression}} suddenly changed. He whispered a name! It was mine! His eyes were soft, {{and his lips}} were parted. The priest had vanished. His face was human <b>and</b> manly. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> but my heart was as cold as steel.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had a letter, {{but it is}} lost. The Roman {{soldiers}} robbed me of my robe {{in which}} it was sewn, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> more. But the ring I saved by hiding it in my mouth while they searched me." ...|$|R

60|$|Yes, {{that first}} raid upon London under the moist and chilly {{depression}} of January had an immense effect upon me. It {{was for me}} an epoch-making disappointment. I had thought of London as a large, free, welcoming, adventurous place, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> slovenly and harsh and irresponsive.|$|E
6000|$|... "Russ--you think--you told me once--he--you {{think he}} still--" [...] She was not facing {{me at all}} now. She had her head bent. Both hands were at her breast, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> heave. Her cheek was white as a flower, her neck darkly, richly red with {{mounting}} blood.|$|E
60|$|All this <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> in an instant, as <b>it</b> were, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> horror {{seemed to}} grip {{me by the}} throat {{as though it were}} a living thing, for as the voice had been familiar, so was the form familiar, though the churchyard had {{received}} it long years ago. I could not speak--I could not even move.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{care what}} anybody thought. It wasn't I that acted, but {{something}} stronger within me. I thought I {{would go to}} a little Greek hotel, while <b>I</b> looked about, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt I knew where to find one.

6000|$|... "Shut your mouth, young man, lest those {{teeth of}} yours should fall out. You wonder how I know?

60|$|It was a silly {{thing to}} say, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> arterwards, but I {{was in such}} a temper I 'ardly knew wot I was saying. I slammed the wicket in 'is face and turned the key and then I took off my clothes and went down that ladder agin.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I told you, Humphrey, Bickley {{would not}} believe, so I will not tell. Perhaps I {{saw it in}} that crystal, as did the necromancers of the early world.
