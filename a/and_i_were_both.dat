500|$|Although Fey {{went on to}} say, [...] "Rachel <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> {{very excited}} about this new direction", Dratch {{said that she was}} not happy with the media's {{depiction}} of the change as a demotion; however, she was also skeptical about the reasons she was given for the change, and was not happy with the {{reduction in the number of}} episodes in which she would appear. Following the first season, Dratch only appeared in a handful of episodes.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{chose to}} save Samantha and {{eliminate}} Rachel, although he expressed severe disappointment with the result, saying [...] "Last night Cameron <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> {{saying that we}} thought both of you would be fantastic Nancys and now here am I faced with this. But I've {{got to make a}} decision and I've got to think of where the show ultimately for Cameron is going to go and I think I have to go with you Samantha.|$|E

5000|$|Can mean [...] "Lola <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> glad I'm a man", or [...] "I'm glad Lola <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> men", or [...] "I'm glad I'm a man, and Lola is also {{glad to be}} a man". Ray Davies {{deliberately}} {{wrote this}} ambiguity into the song, referring to a cross-dresser.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Grant <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> well <b>and</b> send {{much love}} to Mary and the children.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Mr. Knightley, {{one moment}} more; {{something}} of consequence--so shocked!--Jane <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> so shocked about the apples!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The truth <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> here cast [...] Together, {{and we do}} [...] Lie arm in arm, and so hold fast [...] Each other; this is true.'[259] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> {{very young}} when my poor mother died; but I think you must {{remember}} that she, {{like the rest of}} her family, was a Roman Catholic.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rather," [...] she answered, with {{a little}} laugh. [...] "What a stroke of luck it was meeting you here! Flo <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> stony. We hadn't a {{sovereign}} between us when we'd paid for our tickets." ...|$|E
6000|$|Neelie {{immediately}} made a third {{entry on}} the side of [...] "Good": [...] "Allan <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> perfectly reasonable. Skip to the next page." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Hurd," [...] she said, [...] "we {{will not}} waste time. Mr. Macheson <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> {{perfectly}} {{aware that you}} are responsible for Letty's disappearance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Then we {{will make}} shift with a biscuit and the ham; but see that you are quick about it, for this English officer <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> famished.” ...|$|R
60|$|I {{agreed with}} her. I had been {{dreading}} that call all day. It isn't {{a very pleasant}} thing {{to go to a}} man you have recently refused to marry and ask him for money; and Melissa <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> in that predicament.|$|E
6000|$|My wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> so fond {{of country}} life and country pursuits that month after month passed by at our little farm in a {{succession}} of delightful days. Time flew like a [...] "limited express" [...] train, and it was September before we knew it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I know,' said Mary; 'Frank <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> very sorry, and {{we would}} have found her another place, but she would go home. You see, we could not keep her in the nursery, for we must have a {{thoroughly}} trustworthy person to go out with Michael.' ...|$|E
6000|$|My head, though light, 's a dungeon grown, [...] The {{windows of}} my soul are closed; Therefore to sleep I lay me down, [...] My verse <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> composed.|$|R
6000|$|... "There isn't {{very much}} to tell, outside of what I put down in that letter you received. As you know, Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> {{attached}} to this command of Major Okopa." ...|$|R
6000|$|Deringham {{watched her}} closely. [...] "I only wished you to {{understand}} the position, and to remember that you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> to some extent {{at the mercy of}} our rancher kinsman," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{comes of}} a smooth tongue, Floating Tom," [...] exclaimed Hurry, grating {{his teeth in}} pure resentment--"This comes of a smooth tongue, and a silly gal's inclinations, and you had best look into the matter! You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> prisoners--" [...] Hurry could recall that {{circumstance}} now--"you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> prisoners and yet Judith never stirred an inch to do us any sarvice! She is bewitched with this lank-looking Deerslayer, and he, and she, and you, and all of us, had best look to it. I am not a man {{to put up with}} such a wrong quietly, and I say, all the parties had best look to it! Let's up kedge, old fellow, and move nearer to this p'int, and see how matters are getting on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{was glad}} to have her off his hands on any terms. Besides, to tell you the truth, John, I am {{convinced}} he had no notion you would ever come home again. He knew I saw his game, and dreaded I should be off; so he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> of one mind, to have it over as soon as possible.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> enchanted by a spiteful fairy,' said she, 'we {{could not}} free {{ourselves}} till {{we had done}} some kindly deed {{that had never been}} wrought before. My mother died without ever finding a chance of doing anything new, but I took advantage of the evil act of the giant to make you as whole as ever.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not. Miss Marrable <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> {{remarkable}} for the firmness of our characters. When we say Mr. So-and-So is positively to act {{the part of}} Falkland, we positively mean it. Come in and be introduced." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My brother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> good swimmers, <b>and</b> {{we will do}} {{that part}} of the work. The hardest part will be getting it up, and {{you will be able to}} give us your help at that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> seconds--and {{these two}} gentlemen can {{obviously}} fight {{in front of}} us. You, he-he, <b>are</b> the king. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> God; really, they could hardly have better supporters. They {{have come to the}} right place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At Plymouth. Dick <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> born at Plymouth, and Maurice at Scutari; {{then we were}} in the West Indies; {{the next}} two were born all up and down in Jamaica {{and all the rest of}} the Islands--Tom and Terry--dear boys, I've got the charge of them now they are left at school. Three more are Canadians; and little Nora is the only Irish-born one amongst us." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{understood}} {{from what}} followed that Mr. Skimpole {{was to be}} left until the morning to occupy the two places which had been already paid for. As Ada <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> in low spirits concerning Richard and very sorry so to part with him, we made it as plain as we politely could that we should leave Mr. Skimpole to the Dedlock Arms and retire when the night-travellers were gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "True, but he {{has cost}} us heavily in time {{which might have been}} spent in good hunting, in wounds, in hair--I am half plucked along my back--and last of all, in honor. For, remember, Mowgli, I, who am the Black Panther, was forced to call upon Kaa for protection, and Baloo <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> made stupid as little birds by the Hunger Dance. All this, man-cub, came of thy playing with the Bandar-log." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>am.</b> Ingua <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> {{children}} of nature. The only difference <b>is</b> that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> older <b>and</b> {{have been taught}} diplomacy and self-control, which she still lacks. I mask my feelings, while Ingua frankly displays hers. That's why <b>I</b> <b>am</b> attracted to her." ...|$|R
60|$|Of {{course the}} {{engagement}} between us <b>is</b> to continue, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{sure you know}} me too well to suppose that I have ever had a thought to the contrary. Your explanation is (as it naturally would be, being yours) manly <b>and</b> honest, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>both</b> satisfied <b>and</b> hopeful.|$|R
60|$|ATTEN. <b>I</b> {{think you}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> of a mind; for just now <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{thinking}} {{to call you}} back to him also. And pray now, since it is your own motion to return again to him, let us discourse {{a little more of}} his quiet and still death.|$|R
60|$|We did {{not know}} what {{scrambled}} eggs were, and we fancied that it must be some Red Indian or Sandwich Islands sort of dish that required dances and incantations for its proper cooking. Montmorency went and put his nose over it once, and the fat spluttered up and scalded him, and then he began dancing and cursing. Altogether {{it was one of the}} most interesting and exciting operations I have ever witnessed. George <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> quite sorry when it was over.|$|E
60|$|MRS. H. Partly he {{does not}} see, partly he cannot help it. He has been so entirely {{accustomed}} to have all those family and parish details taken off his hands, and borne easily as they were when your dear grandmamma <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> there at home, that he cannot understand {{that they can be}} over much--especially as they are so small in themselves. Besides, he is not so young as he was, and your dear mother cannot bear to trouble him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Danvers <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> of opinion, Mr. Hawtrey, that by {{his tone}} and manner {{when he spoke}} to you about payment of debts, that he had already done you some injury or had some {{distinct}} plan in his head. At that time your daughter was not engaged to Lord Halliburn, and his ideas may have been vague ones until the public notice of the engagement met his eye, when he may have said to himself, [...] "This is my opportunity for taking my revenge, by annoying both father and daughter."' ...|$|E
5000|$|Lord Lovat {{instructed}} {{his personal}} piper, Bill Millin, to pipe the commandos ashore, {{in defiance of}} specific orders not to allow such an action in battle. When Private Millin demurred, citing the regulations, he recalled later, Lord Lovat replied: “Ah, but that’s the English War Office. You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> Scottish, <b>and</b> that doesn’t apply.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ruby <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> honest;--ain't we, Ruby? I want to {{take her}} out to dinner, Mrs Pipkin. She shall be back before late;--before ten; she shall indeed.' Ruby {{inclined}} herself still more closely towards his shoulder. 'Come, Ruby, get your hat and change your dress, and we'll be off. I've ever {{so many things to}} tell you.' ...|$|R
50|$|Essentially, the vowels e <b>and</b> <b>i</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> reduced <b>and</b> devoiced (or completey deleted) {{in final}} word position, and {{sometimes}} also when unstressed and between consonants, always palatalizing the previous consonant. The vowels o and u are also reduced and devoiced to ʊ̥, analogously {{to what happens}} in Japanese (see Japanese phonology#Devoicing). More rarely, a may become ɐ̥ as well.|$|R
