40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the possibilities of}} integrating cost information and engineering design. Special emphasis is put on finding the potential of using the <b>activity-based</b> <b>costing</b> (ABC) <b>method.</b> Today, the problem of cost estimation in engineering design {{is that there are}} two separate extremes of knowledge. On the one extreme, the engineers model the technical parametres behindcosts in great detail but do not get appropriate cost information to their elegant models. On the other extreme, the accounting professionals are stuck with traditional <b>cost</b> accounting <b>methods</b> driven by the procedures and cycles of financial accounting. Therefore, in many cases, the cost information needs of various decision making groups, for example design engineers, are not served satisfactorily. This paper studies if the <b>activity-based</b> <b>costing</b> (ABC) <b>method</b> could offer a compromise between the two extremes. Recognizing activities and activity chains as well as activity and cost drivers could be specially beneficial for design engineers. Also, recognizing the accurate and reliable product costs of existing products helps when doing variant design. However, ABC is not at its best if the cost system becomes too complicated. This is why a comprehensive ABC-cost information system with detailed cost information for the use of design engineers should be examined critically. ABC is at its best when considering such issues as which activities drive costs, the cost of product complexity, allocating indirect costs on the products, the relationships between processes and costs, and the cost of excess capacity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the cost-effectiveness of the national public sector specialist periodontal program in the management of periodontal disease. MethodsThis was a multicenter, time motion, prospective, economic evaluation study involving a total of 165 patients with periodontitis recruited from five selected specialist periodontal clinics. Treatment costs were measured in 2012 Malaysian ringgit (MYR) and estimated from the societal perspective using step-down and <b>activity-based</b> <b>costing</b> <b>methods,</b> and substantiated by clinical pathways. A cost-effectiveness analysis was done to compare the specialist periodontal program with a hypothetical scenario in which patients attend biannual dental visits only for regular dental check-up and scaling. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was defined as the difference in cost per gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and clinical attachment levels (CALs). One-way scenario-based sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the uncertainty of inputs. ResultsThe average cost for managing patients with periodontitis was MYR 376 per outpatient visit and MYR 2820 per annum. Clinically, a gain of an average of 0. 3 mm of CAL was attained at post-treatment (paired t test, P <. 001). Patients gained an average of 3. 8 QALY post-treatment (paired t test, P <. 001). For cost-effectiveness analysis, the specialist periodontal program was more cost-effective than the hypothesized biannual dental visits, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of MYR 451 and MYR 5713 per additional QALY and millimeter CAL gained, respectively. ConclusionsIt is very cost-effective for the public sector to provide specialist periodontal treatment for patients with periodontitis according to the World Health Organization criteria and when compared with conventional biannual dental treatment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Nursing home {{residents}} with dementia are often dependent on others for mouth care, yet will react with care-resistant behavior when receiving assistance. The oral health of these elders deteriorates {{in the absence}} of daily oral hygiene, predisposing them to harmful systemic problems such as pneumonia, hyperglycemia, cardiac disease, and cerebral vascular accidents. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether care-resistant behaviors can be reduced, and oral health improved, through the application of an intervention based on the neurobiological principles of threat perception and fear response. The intervention, called Managing Oral Hygiene Using Threat Reduction, combines best mouth care practices with a constellation of behavioral techniques that reduce threat perception and thereby prevent or de-escalate care-resistant behaviors. Methods/Design Using a randomized repeated measures design, 80 elders with dementia from 5 different nursing homes will be randomized at the individual level to the experimental group, which will receive the intervention, or to the control group, which will receive standard mouth care from research team members who receive training in the proper methods for providing mouth care but no training in resistance recognition or prevention/mediation. Oral health assessments and care-resistant behavior measurements will be obtained during a 7 -day observation period and a 21 -day intervention period. Individual growth models using multilevel analysis will be used to estimate the efficacy of the intervention for reducing care-resistant behaviors in persons with dementia, and to estimate the overall efficacy of the intervention using oral health outcomes. <b>Activity-based</b> <b>costing</b> <b>methods</b> will be used to determine the cost of the proposed intervention. Discussion At the conclusion of this study, the research team anticipates having a proven intervention that prevents and reduces care-resistant within the context of mouth care. Long-term objectives include testing the effect of the intervention on systemic illnesses among persons with dementia; examining the transferability of this intervention to other activities of daily living; and disseminating threat reduction interventions to nursing home staff, which may radically change the manner in which care is provided to persons with dementia.

In the current socio-economic situation, it is challenging to cope with the same or reduced resources in managing the same processes and activities, so that the quality of the result would not be affected. The need of library managers to justify their costs to their parent organizations has become particularly important, perhaps even more important than ever in the history. With the data they have traditionally collected, libraries can assess details about the costs of collection building; what they need now are reliable data about the costs of their services and products. However, libraries lack a specific overview of the activities between which their costs are divided. Cost accounting is the simple process of breaking down resources to the activity being carried on and then collating the monetary cost to show the cost of the activity. The time-driven <b>activity-based</b> <b>costing</b> TDABC helps to get a better picture of the acquisition related activities that libraries are actually engaged in and their costs.

40|$|New {{business}} environment {{has changed the}} structure and behaviour of company costs. The changes are primarily reflected in the increasing share of overhead costs in the total costs. Given that competitiveness {{is reflected in the}} unit product cost, the exact determination of unit costs by cost drivers, primarily the precise allocation of overhead costs to cost drivers, have become crucial to the survival of companies in a turbulent market environment. The biggest problem in determining the exact product costs is incorrect allocation of overhead costs to cost drivers.

40|$|Background: Cost {{analysis}} in laboratories represents a necessary phase in their scientific progression. Aim: To calculate indirect cost and thus total cost per sample of various tests at Hematopathology laboratory (HPL) Settings and Design: <b>Activity-based</b> <b>costing</b> (ABC) <b>method</b> {{is used to}} calculate per cost test of the hematopathology laboratory. Material and Methods: Information is collected from registers, purchase orders, annual maintenance contracts (AMCs), payrolls, account books, hospital bills and registers along with informal interviews with hospital staff. Results: Cost per test decreases as total number of samples increases. Maximum annual expense at the HPL is on reagents and consumables followed by manpower. Cost per test is higher for specialized tests which interpret morphological or flow data and are done by a pathologist. Conclusions: Despite several limitations and assumptions, this was an attempt to understand how the resources are consumed in a large size government-run laboratory. The rate structure needs to be revised for most of the tests, mainly for complete blood counts (CBC), bone marrow examination, coagulation tests and Immunophenotyping. This costing exercise is laboratory specific and each laboratory needs to do its own costing.

This unfamiliar operational environment of the Arctic poses new challenges for the industry, as climate is harsher, the geographical location is more remote from the market and oil and gas fields are located in an environmentally sensitive area. Due to lack of data and experience with Arctic operations, the uncertainty and risks can be higher than in the familiar climate on the North Sea, as well as it is expected that there may also be increased operational and maintenance costs. This research highlights the main challenges of the Arctic climate affecting life-cycle costs of advanced, complex and integrated offshore oil and gas production facilities.
