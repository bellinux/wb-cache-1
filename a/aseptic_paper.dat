2500|$|Milk in Kenya {{is mostly}} sold in plastic-coated <b>aseptic</b> <b>paper</b> cartons {{supplied}} in 300 mL, 500 mL or 1 liter volumes. In rural areas, milk {{is stored in}} plastic bottles or gourds. The standard unit of measuring milk quantity in Kenya is a liter.|$|E
40|$|Tetra-pak is {{a popular}} packing material, which is using as aseptic {{packaging}} of liquid food products, especially: fruit juice, beverages and milk. After single use a packing are throw out. Carton could not be reuse because the material has contact with food and must be <b>aseptic.</b> The <b>paper</b> describes the way of recycling tetra-pak waste in the world. It is focus on possibilities to optimize the mechanical properties of composite material and modifications of its property {{depending on the type}} and amount of added polyethylene and method of manufacture. Main physic-mechanical properties of plate made from tetra â€“ pak waste are presented. This property can be interesting for the construction industry...|$|R
40|$|Aseptic {{loosening}} is {{the major}} cause of failure of joint replacement prostheses. Polyethylene implants removed at revision regularly show wear. It is proposed that the polyethylene particles released into the tissues {{as a consequence of}} this wear induce a tissue response that precedes <b>aseptic</b> loosening. This <b>paper</b> presents the results of recent invivo and inviro studies of the biological response to polyethylene wear particles undertaken in the authors' laboratories. A clinical perspective is provided by the inclusion of the author's recent observations of retrieval analyses of joint replacement implant wear and the tissue response to polyethylene in humans.

40|$|Waste {{problem is}} a {{complicated}} problem in Indonesia; aseptic packaging waste is one of them. This study student tried to recycle <b>paper</b> carton <b>aseptic</b> packaging into <b>paper</b> art. The {{purpose of this study}} was to learn how variations of adhesive influence raw material mass in the process of aseptic packaging waste into art paper, to analize the quality of the result on its grammature test, tearing strength index, tensile strength index, and the bursting strength index Student used 50 gr of raw material mass and variations of 5 %, 7. 5 % and 10 % of PVAC adhesive. The results of generated paper art then tested in the laboratory of paper to determine its Grammature, Tearing strength index, Tensile strength index, and the Bursting strength index. The best results for Grammature determination at 10 % adhesive concentration is 352 g. The best result for Tensile strength index at 10 % adhesive concentration is. 7. 56 mN. The best results for Tearing strength index 10 % adhesive concentration is 4776 kN / m and the best results for Bursting strength index is 545. 84 kPa. Overall the paper art produced, including in both categories in accordance with the quality standards of food packaging cardboard and paper...|$|R
