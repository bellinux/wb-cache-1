The purpose of this study was to show the effect of the use of high dosage of <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>admixture</b> on the properties of self-compacting concrete. An experimental investigation on the frost-salt scaling resistance of conventional and air entraining selfcompacting concrete incorporating slag-blended cement and supplementary cementitious materials was carried out.

Lightweight concrete (LWC) has been successfully used since the ancient roman times.

40|$|The {{stability}} of air bubbles in fresh concrete {{can have a}} profound influence of the potential durability of the system, because excessive losses during placement and consolidation can compromise {{the ability of the}} mixture to resist freezing and thawing.

The foam drainage test provides a means of measuring the potential stability of air bubbles in a paste.

The work reported here was a limited exercise seeking to observe the stability of a range of currently available AEA/WRA combinations in the foam drainage test; then, to take the best and the worst and observe their stabilities on concrete mixtures in the lab.

40|$|The most {{widespread}} and economically attractive option for utilizing fly ash is in concrete manufacture, where the fly ash {{serves as a}} partial replacement for Portland cement [Helmuth, 1987; Malhotra and Mehta, 1996]. In most concrete mixtures, specialty surfactants, or "air <b>entraining</b> <b>admixtures,</b> " are added to stabilize sub-millimeter air bubbles, which improve resistance to freeze / thaw cycles [Lea, 1970; Ramachandran, 1995; Rixom and Mailvaganam, 1986; Freeman et al., 1997]. Solid carbon residues, if present in fly ash in high concentration, can adsorb these surfactants and render them unable to fulfill their intended function. Experimental characterization {{of a set of}} over 70 U. S. fly ash samples at Brown has identified four primary factors responsible for the adsorptivity of a given fly ash: (1) the carbon content, or LOI, (2) the specific carbon surface area, m 2 /g-carbon, (3) the carbon pore size distribution, and (4) the carbon surface chemistry. The work suggests that the nonpolar fraction of the total carbon surface area competes directly with the air / water interface for the nonpolar portions of amphiphilic molecules in <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>admixtures.</b> The ultimate outcome of this competition determines the number and size of air bubbles, and is strongly influenced by the amount of accessible, nonpolar carbon surface area.

40|$|The {{cause for}} {{deterioration}} of the concrete structure located in severe environment has been explored both in field and in laboratory. Serious cracking and spalling appeared upon surface of the concrete structure soon after the structure was put into service. Both alkali-aggregate reaction and freeze-thaw cycles may result in similar macro visible cracking and spalling. The possibility of alkali-aggregate reaction was excluded by both field survey and lab examination such as chemical analysis, petrographic analysis, and determination of alkali reactivity of aggregates. According to results of freeze-thaw cycles, impermeability testing, and microstructure analysis, it is deduced that the severe environmental conditions plus the relatively inferior frost resistance cause the deterioration of concrete. Usage of <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>admixture</b> can improve frost resistance and impermeability.

40|$|A b s t r a c t In {{order to}} explain the effect of <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>admixture</b> (AEA) {{and the type of}} cement on the {{properties}} of fresh mortar, the following tests were carried: bulk density, flow and air content of 10 air entrained mortars and 10 non air entrained mortars made of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and blended Portland cements: blast furnace slag (BSF) – limestone powder (LP), fly ash- limestone, fly ash (FA) and (BFS) cement. It has been found that the modern anionic AEAs from the group of alkyl sulfates are much more efficient and active than traditional ones i. e. sodium abietate. It is difficult to entrain air into mortars with cement of various types to the same content of air. This requires to carry out a number of tests to determine the appropriate amounts of AEA. The air entrainment of LP cement mortar does not significantly change its flow. The air entrainment of BSF and FA cement mortars increases their workability. The lowest content of air was stated in non-air-entrained mortars with FA cement, the highest air content was observed in BFS cement mortars. According to the results the bulk density of mortars is inversely proportional to the amount of air entrained...|$|E

Mixes with cement contents from 100 kg/m 3 to 450 kg/m 3 with and without <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>admixtures</b> were proportioned for studying {{a few of the}} mechanical and durability characteristics. Locally available olitic limestone was used as aggregates and the mix proportioning was done using soil-analogy method.

40|$|Insulating {{concrete}} {{is a type}} {{of material}} designed to enhance energy efficiency by reducing thermal conductivity. It contains numerous voids induced by the use of <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>admixtures</b> or aggregates, and these voids strongly affect the characteristics and responses of the material. Thus, appropriate methods to examine the void distribution of materials are needed. Here, X ray micro computed tomography micro CT is adopted to investigate the spatial distribution of voids in a material without destroying the specimen. By using micro CT, a series of cross sectional images with the micrometer range pixel size can be obtained. Then, void density contour and probabilistic description methods, such as two point correlation and lineal path functions, are used to describe the void distribution inside the specimen. In this study, Aer solids, small prefabricated hollow air bubbles, are used for insulating cement paste specimens to increase the insulating effect. The cement paste specimens with different void ratios and Aer solids are generated, and their void distribution characteristics are investigated using the methods mentioned above. The thermal and mechanical responses of the insulating specimens are also evaluated by experiments and numerical methods. The effect of Aer solids on the material characteristics and the relationship between void distribution and material responses are confirmed from the obtained results...|$|R
30|$|Correlation {{coefficients}} for concrete admixtures were obtained using IR scans {{from three different}} batches from the manufacturers supplied at three reasonable separated time intervals. The reliability of this quantitative approach to test job samples was analyzed and evaluated by testing several randomly selected job samples using the established target correlations. The quantitative approach {{seems to be a}} more reliable method for determining whether or not concrete admixtures are acceptable and will perform the tasks required of the material. The quantitative approach can be used to support assessments made by the qualitative method. The limitation of this method is bound by the library created from the supplied manufacturer admixtures. This library of scans and correlation values needs to be updated whenever concrete admixtures are altered by the manufacturer. The level of accuracy of this approach is also dependant on the acceptance criteria and the target error level for admixtures. More testing of job samples is needed to verify the selected target correlation. Further testing of manufacturer samples and batches may be needed for further investigation and justification of the target correlations and error level. The study showed that the drying time may be increased to 24  h for <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>admixtures,</b> but more testing should be done in order to confirm this drying time. Potassium bromide (KBr) has a significant effect on the correlation coefficients and must be consistent throughout the entire library and job sample testing process. Future research is needed to find what other factors, in addition to the KBr, that may influence the IR analysis such as sample mixing time, press time, volume of KBr, and sample volume.|$|R

40|$|Freezing and thawing cycles {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{damaging}} factors that affect the durability of concrete. The damages caused by the cyclic freeze-thaw action can be divided into two factors. The first factor is an increase in internal crack, which causes the loss in relative dynamic modulus (RDM) of the concrete and the second factor is surface scaling, which leads to weight loss of the concrete. In this study, the durability of concrete made by replacing natural coarse aggregates (NCA) with various percentages of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA). Also some tests have been conducted with the addition of <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>admixture</b> (AEA). Prior to mixing the concrete, both NCA and RCA were characterized to determine their suitability as a construction material. Concrete mixes consisting of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 % replacement (by weight) of NCA with RCA were prepared. The same concrete mixes were prepared again but with the addition of an air entraining admixtures (AEA). All specimens were tested for compressive strength after a curing period of 7, 14, and 28 days. The compressive strength of the concrete made with different percentage of RCA decreases as the percentage of RCA increases. After 28 days of curing, samples with 0, 40, and 100 % replacement of NCA with RCA were placed in the freeze-thaw chamber along with 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 % NCA replacement containing AEA. After several cycles of freezing and thawing; the RDM, change in weight and change in length were measured. In this study loss of RDM and weight loss were noticed, as the cyclic freeze-thaw increases.

40|$|Internally cured (IC) {{concrete}} {{has been}} emerging {{over the last}} decade as an effective way to improve the performance of concrete. IC holds promise for producing concretes with an increased resistance to early-age cracking and ultimately enhancing the durability of structures. It is a simple and effective way to ensure proper hydration of cementitious material in high performance concrete mixtures; mixtures in which traditional, external, curing can be ineffective. IC supplies water that is necessary to relieve stress buildup from chemical shrinkage and in turn helping to prevent early age shrinkage cracking. ^ The first part of this thesis presents and evaluates nine mixtures; two of which are standard mixtures that replicate Colorado DOT Class H and Class D (bridge deck and structural, respectively) mixtures and seven of which are altered standard mixtures to incorporate IC methods by use of pre-wetted lightweight aggregates (LWAs). Investigation into the fresh, mechanical, shrinkage, and transport properties of these mixtures is performed. This portion demonstrates the benefits of IC concrete mixtures through a variety of performance testing methodologies and provides insight to designing IC mixtures, such that these benefits can be fully utilized. ^ Values for slump, air content (by the pressure and volumetric methods), and unit weight are reported for the fresh properties of the mixtures. Compressive strength and elastic modulus at 28 and 56 days are reported for the mechanical properties. Autogenous, restrained, and drying shrinkage tests were performed. IC mixtures prevented autogenous shrinkage and caused expansion (or swelling) in the system. Restrained shrinkage showed that IC concrete reduced the residual stress buildup in the material. IC mixtures demonstrated improved drying shrinkage performance, as water is present to maintain a higher internal relative humidity. In addition, IC concrete was shown to reduce the chloride diffusion coefficient and tortuosity compared to standard mixtures, which is attributed to increased hydration. Overall, it is clear that IC is an effective and beneficial method for concrete mixtures. ^ While IC concrete has shown great promise for increased performance in concrete, some concerns have been raised regarding the potential for water to remain in the pores of the LWAs. This could create issues in freezing that otherwise may not be present, such as additional damage from the un-used water expanding during a freezing. Freezing of IC mixtures could have potential to shorten the service life of structures, opposing the benefits gained from using IC concrete. ^ The second portion of this thesis presents an experimental approach to evaluate the freezing and thawing behavior of IC concrete. An investigation into the use of LWA, as well as super absorbent polymers (SAPs), for IC concrete exposed to cyclic freezing and thawing environments has been performed by quantitatively showing the freeze-thaw durability for these mixtures. The results suggest that properly air entrained IC concrete with a reasonable w/c (approximately 0. 48 or less) have no issues in resisting cyclic freeze-thaw action. However, 2 ̆ 2 excessively 2 ̆ 2 IC mixtures may perform poorly in freeze-thaw environments. SAP IC mixtures that include an <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>admixture</b> demonstrate no issues in freezing and thawing tests. SAP mixtures that do not include an <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>admixture</b> have demonstrated poor performance in freezing and thawing. ^ Other issues related to the freeze-thaw performance of concrete are caused by exposure to deicing salts. These are used to lower the freezing temperature of water on concrete surfaces, in turn preventing ice formation and increasing transportation safety. However, salts are partially responsible for issues that develop in pavement. One way to prevent damage is to seal the faces of the concrete surface to help repel the fluid. However, a proper testing method for quantifying chloride rejection of sealers during thermal cycling does not exist. ^ The final portion of this thesis examines the penetration of chlorides in hardened concrete due to interaction with salts that have potential for deterioration. The objective of this portion is to develop a testing procedure {{to assess the impact of}} sealers, pore blockers, and water repelling materials to delay or prevent chloride solution ingress. Presented is a testing methodology, which closely replicates concretes field exposure to fluids containing salts. Furthermore, a phenomenon coined as chloride pumping is presented. This is presumed to expedite the absorption of chlorides in concrete that are exposed to freezing conditions. ...|$|E

The Theory involves mathematical formulae and geometrical models to explain the roles of void filling and particle interference which determine the properties of mixtures. The practical operation of the theory has been confirmed for application to aggregates, powder pastes, mortars and concretes covering such properties as water demand, cohesion and per cent fines, cement content and plastic density. Derived relationships are examined including those between water demand and cement content The original concept proposed by the author in 1983 has been confirmed in principle and modified in detail {{on the basis of the}} current research and extended to include plasticising or water reducing and <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>admixtures</b> and the properties of air content and compressive strength together with derived relationships such as those between compressive strength and cement content.

40|$|The most {{prevalent}} method {{for the prevention}} of freeze-thaw and salt scaling damage in cement based materials is through the entrainment of air voids using <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> chemical <b>admixtures</b> (AEA's). However, the common field methods for measuring air content in fresh concrete cannot distinguish between entrained and entrapped air voids, and the actual air content in the hardened concrete can vary from that determined by these tests due to a variety of factors such as workability, placing operations, consolidation efforts, and environmental conditions. Previous research has shown the ability of ultrasonic attenuation to distinguish between entrained and entrapped air voids in hardened cement paste, providing a foundation for an inversion procedure to calculate the size and volume content of the two scatterer sizes. While additional challenges are present with measurements in fresh paste, the use of an immersion setup can overcome the limitations of cement paste containment vessels and provide a means to measure air content from batching to placement. An immersion apparatus to monitor ultrasonic wave attributes including attenuation in fresh cement paste is designed and built. Results comparing air entrained and non-air entrained cement pastes are presented. Ultrasonic wave attributes are studied as a function of time and level of chemical air entrainer.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the project {{is to build a}} multi-product ash beneficiation plant at Kentucky Utilities 2, 200 -MW Ghent Generating Station, located in Carroll County, Kentucky. This part of the study includes an investigation of the secondary classification characteristics of the ash feedstock excavated from the lower ash pond at Ghent Station. The secondary classification testing was concluded using a continuous demonstration-scale lamella classifier that was operated at a feed rate of 0. 3 to 1. 5 tons/hr. Feed to the secondary classifier was generated by operating the primary classifier at the conditions shown to be effective previously. Samples were taken while the secondary classifier was operated under a variety of conditions {{in order to determine the}} range of conditions where the unit could be efficiently operated. Secondary classification was effective for producing an ultra-fine ash (UFA) product. Inclined lamella plates provided an effective settling surface for coarser ash particles and plate spacing was shown to be an important variable. Results showed that the closer the plate spacing, the finer the size distribution of the UFA product. Flotation of the secondary classifier feed provided a lower LOI UFA product (2. 5 % LOI vs. 4. 5 % LOI) and a dispersant dosage of 2 to 2. 5 g/kg was adequate to provide UFA grade (3. 8 to 4. 4 {micro}m) and recovery (53 to 68 % 5 {micro}m recovery). The UFA yield without flotation was {approx} 33 % and lower ({approx} 20 %) with flotation. Demonstration plant product evaluations showed that water requirements in mortar were reduced and 100 % of control strength was achieved in 28 days for the coarser products followed by further strength gain of up to 130 % in 56 days. The highest strengths of 110 % of control in 7 days and 140 % in 56 days were achieved with the finer products. Mortar air requirements for processed products were essentially the same as those for standard mortar, suggesting that the unburned carbon remaining does not have an affinity for <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>admixture</b> (AEA), a consideration that is a significant benefit. In concrete, substitution of 20 % showed that the UFA product outperformed a typical ash by achieving 105 to 107 % of control strength after 28 days and 109. 5 to 112 % after 56 days. Higher substitution levels were shown to delay early strength development, but surpass control strength after 28 days while lower substitution levels provide both early and longer term strength. One of the most significant benefits provided by using UFA in concrete mix designs is the improved resistance to chloride permeability while some improvements is flexural strength were realized and tensile strength was essentially unchanged. Potentially significant benefits may also be offered by using UFA as a process addition in the manufacture of cement clinker...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 This {{thesis is}} the {{consequence}} of a research effort undertaken by the School of Civil and Construction Engineering at Oregon State University and funded by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The principal objective of the effort was to reduce the life cycle cost of bridges by developing one or more materials systems for precast and pre-stressed bridge deck components that improve the studded tire wear (abrasion) resistance and durability of bridge decks. Degradation of the concrete bridge decks due to abrasion caused by the studded tires and accelerated corrosion of the reinforcing steel in the concrete often triggers costly, premature rehabilitation or replacement of these bridges. High performance concrete (HPC) can provide improved abrasion resistance, but is more costly than ordinary concrete and can exhibit early age cracking when used for cast-in-place concrete members, which can accelerate corrosion of embedded reinforcing steel. However, several {{studies have suggested that}} HPC developed for precast members offers a viable alternative to cast-in-place concrete deck slabs due in part to improved control of the curing process. The scope of this research was to develop one or more mixture designs for HPC that improve the durability and abrasion resistance of the bridge decks through careful selection and proper proportioning of the constituent materials and improved control of the curing process. The materials investigated in this research included silica fume, slag, and fly ash as partial replacement of Type I and Type III portland cement mixed with crushed aggregate and river gravel. Phase I of the study included development of 15 mixture designs incorporating various combinations of the materials. Mixtures were cast under controlled laboratory conditions and cured using a variety of methods. The results of tests conducted on the cured samples indicated that the mixture with silica fume and slag had greater strength than the mixture with silica fume and fly ash mixture, and that mixtures with crushed rock provided better abrasion resistance than those with river gravel. Results from the chloride ion penetration test for permeability indicated that mixtures cured in saturated lime water for 28 days exhibited reduced permeability in comparison to mixtures which were steam cured followed by ambient curing. Following phase I, a pilot study was undertaken to identify the best curing method to apply during production at precast yards to assist high early strength gain so that the concrete member can be removed from the casting bed in a matter of several hours as well as to facilitate high ultimate strength, improved abrasion resistance, and low permeability. The pilot study indicated the best curing method to be steam curing followed by application of a curing compound. Phase II of the research study included seven mix designs and focused on various levels of supplementary cementitious materials. It adopted the curing method suggested by the pilot study. Results from phase II indicated that slag was better in enhancing durability of the concrete than fly ash. Increasing the proportion of silica fume did not improve the properties of high performance concrete significantly. Some other interesting results indicated that compressive strength was inversely proportional to wear rate and chloride ion penetration. Wear rate was directly proportional to chloride ion penetration. There was no relationship between durability factor (freeze-thaw test) and compressive strength or chloride ion penetration. Two mixtures were identified as having significantly improved abrasion and permeability characteristics over the control mixture (ODOT bridge deck mixture). Both included slag and silica fume as supplementary cementitious materials as a partial replacement of portland cement and one did not contain an <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> <b>admixture...</b>|$|E

40|$|High {{friction}} {{response in}} pavement improves road safety, while reduced noise production from the tire-pavement interface benefits {{public health and}} the economy of a country. According to Transport Canada, highway crashes cost Canadians approximately $ 67 billion annually. The economic impact of noise is difficult to quantify; however, billions of dollars have been invested in noise barriers as noise mitigation alternatives. Roadway safety is related to many factors including the friction characteristics or skid resistance of pavements. Lack of sufficient friction at the tire-pavement interface is a significant contributing factor to vehicle crashes. Skid resistance of pavement is affected by both: the microtexture of the pavement as related to the fine and coarse aggregate properties in the mortar phase of the concrete mixture; and by the macrotexture, which is defined as the measurable grooves formed in the plastic concrete during the finishing operation, or created in the hardened pavement with cutting heads consisting of uniformly spaced circular diamond saw blades. Traffic noise is also a growing concern for {{public health and the}} country’s economy. Tire-pavement noise predominates over the other sources of roadway noise in many circumstances. Under accelerating conditions, the tire-pavement noise is dominant at speeds greater than 35 to 45 km/h for cars, and 45 to 55 km/h for trucks. Although the tire-pavement noise is generated through a variety of mechanisms at the tire-pavement contact patch, it is recognized that a proper design of Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement surface may assist in reducing noise levels and thus has prompted the evaluation of new macrotextures. However, an optimization process must be carried out to achieve adequate friction while reducing noise generation through macrotexture because large macrotexture can increase friction and generate excessive noise due to an inadequate tire-pavement interaction. Next Generation Concrete Surface (NGCS) is the first new concrete pavement texture introduced in the United States in the last 20 to 30 years. NGCS also has the quietest texture developed for conventional concrete pavements, mainly through macrotexture modification. The construction process uses conventional diamond grinding equipment, but the blades have a different configuration in the drum. Currently, after the evaluations of long term pavement performance and noise characteristics of the NGCS, concerns have been reported regarding durability and increased noise level over time. In this research, a laboratory investigation examined how friction, noise absorption, and surface durability can be improved by modifying the concrete microtexture. The innovative approach of this research involved investigating those properties of concrete pavement through microtexture modification using nanotechnology. Nanotechnology involves manipulating materials at scales below 100 nm. Two different products were investigated: nanosilica applied in the cement paste, and a nano lotus leaf solution applied as a coating to mimic the lotus leaf effect. Several concrete mixes were prepared and tested in the laboratory. Results reveal that microtexture modification through the addition of nanosilica can change the properties of fresh concrete, hardened concrete, and concrete durability. In fresh concrete, the main findings indicate that nanosilica reduces the concrete slump and also reduces the air content for a given water cement ratio; however, the slump and air content can be adjusted using High Range Water Reduced and <b>Air</b> <b>Entraining</b> <b>Admixtures.</b> In hardened concrete, results reveal that a small amount of nanosilica can accelerate the hydration process and enhance the compressive strength and the friction response. Results also reveal that nanosilica cannot significantly modify the sound absorption coefficient. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images in hardened concrete provide insight into the impact that the nanosilica has on the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ). Nanosilica can reduce ettringite crystal formation in voids and can also produce a denser and a more compact cement paste. Regarding durability, several abrasion tests using the rotating cutter method indicate that nanosilica can enhance the concrete’s abrasion response, resulting in better wear resistance and durability of PCC road surfaces. Freezing and thawing, and scaling resistance results show that nanoconcrete is able to reduce the external damage on the PCC surface. Regarding the coating mimicking the lotus leaf effect, several concrete mixes were prepared and tested in the laboratory. Visual inspections demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} create the lotus leaf effect on concrete surfaces. Laboratory results reveal that the coating is able to maintain the friction response of concrete surfaces; however, results also reveal that the sound absorption coefficient is not significantly affected by the coating. Further research must be done to determine the coating impact on the hydroplaning effect when a heavy rainfall is present...|$|R
40|$|Concrete patch repair {{has long}} been used to repair the damaged {{concrete}} structures. In cold regions, freeze– thaw cycle {{is one of the}} major damage factors. Not only the material itself is damaged by freeze–thaw cycles, but also the adhesive interface, which is regarded as the weakest part of composite system, degrades under freeze–thaw cycles. <b>Air</b> <b>entraining</b> agent {{has long been}} used to increase the freeze–thaw resistance of concrete materials. However, the effect of <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> agent on the adhesive interface under freeze–thaw cycles has not been explored. The degradation mechanism and failure mode of concrete repair system have not been studied, either. In this study, to investigate the effects of water–cement ratio of substrate concrete and <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> agent in substrate concrete and repairing mortars, three kinds of substrate concrete were casted and repaired by two kinds of ordinary Portland cement mortar. With certain number of freeze–thaw cycles up to 150 cycles, through splitting prism test, the splitting tensile strength and failure mode of composite specimens were experimented. The relative dynamic elastic modulus and splitting tensile strength of substrate concretes and repairing mortars were obtained as well. Results showed that <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> agent in the repairing mortar greatly influenced the adhesive tensile strength under freeze–thaw cycles. The water–cement ratio and <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> agent of substrate concrete insignificantly affected the adhesive interface, but affected the splitting tensile strength and the freeze– thaw resistance of substrate concrete, and thus affected the failure mode of composite specimens...|$|R

This paper made a {{study on}} the effect of {{different}} vibrating parameters on the air content and compressive strength of concrete by the test of using the combining method of vibrating and forced mixing, and compared it with common forced mixing and mixing with <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> agent. It indicated that the blade of the mixer, also as the vibrating source of vibrating mixing, had a significant effect on the air content of fresh concrete and compressive strength of hardened concrete; the air content of the fresh concrete could be up to 3. 0 %~ 3. 5 % when the vibrating strength was 4 ~ 8, and meanwhile the compressive strength of the hardened concrete was higher; different with improving the air content by adding <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> agent, the vibrating mixing could increase the air content in the concrete by more retained air from bubbles refined in the mixing process and make the diameters of pores inside in the decreasing direction.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>entraining</b> {{agents are}} widely used in Australia to impart {{plasticity}} to the fresh mortar. the entrainment of a large quantity of air into the mortar affects the hardened mortar properties, in particular the mortar-to-unit bond strength. This report is {{a summary of the}} investigations carried out at the University of Newcastle to evaluate the effects of <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> agents on bond strength and mortar microstructure. The microscopy work indicates that the reduction in bond strength is due to the reduced transport of cementitious material to the brick/mortar interface and through the formation of 'pseudo' aggregate particles within the cement paste by the entrained air bubbles.

40|$|Among various {{parameters}} {{that influence}} {{the properties of the}} composite, the bond between the cementitious matrix and the fibres is the most important one. This paper investigates the influence of admixtures - silica fume, superplasticizer and <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> agent - on the improvement of the bond between bundled carbon filaments and cementitious mortars. An overall microstructural analysis has shown that the addition of silica fume strengthen the interfacial transition zone by both the reduction of its porosity and the consumption of CH crystals. The addition of a superplasticizer increased the workability of fresh mortars, but the bond improvement was insignificant. The application of the <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> agent caused the formation of air bubbles inside the mortar matrix. Air bubbles formed {{in the vicinity of the}} multifilament yarn were found to provide mechanical anchoring for fibres leading to a significant increase in interface friction. Fibre-bundle pullout tests were carried out to confirm the effectiveness of the admixtures to improve the interface bonding. Based on the resulting load-displacement curves, <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> agent was found to be most effective in enhancing the bonding characteristics of the cementitious composite...|$|R
40|$|Self-compacting {{concrete}} (SCC) {{has been}} developed over the past 25 years {{in order to improve}} the durability of concrete structures. The cement content in mix proportion of SCC must be approximately 2 times higher than that of conventional concrete, hence SCC cost is higher than that of conventional concrete. Air-entraining agent (AE), new-type superplasticizer, viscosity agent were added to the mix {{in order to reduce the}} interaction between coarse aggregate and mortar (1 -Rmb/Rm) and to increase the sand to mortar ratio (s/m). This resulted in a reduction in cement content of the mix proportion. The interaction between coarse aggregate and mortar depend on various factors such as sand content (s/m), water to cement ratio (W/C), type of superplasticizer, amount of viscosity agent and type of <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> agent. The interaction between coarse aggregate and mortar was reduced by adding viscosity agent in mix, however it is effective for mix proportion, which contain moderate W/C (32 %- 35 %). Furthermore, the interaction between coarse aggregate and mortar can be reduced by using of new-type superplasticizer and new-type <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> agent. These results demonstrated that sand content can be increased, which resulted in the decrease automatically in cement content by adding optimum amount of viscosity agent, using new-type superplasticizer and using new-type <b>air</b> <b>entraining</b> agent...|$|R
