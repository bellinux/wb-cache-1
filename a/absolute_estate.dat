Lord Coke sagaciously observes upon it, [...] "That in the charter of {{creating}} the Black Prince Edward Prince of Wales {{there is a great}} mystery: for less than an estate of inheritance so great a prince could not have, and an <b>absolute</b> <b>estate</b> of inheritance in so great a principality as Wales (this principality being so dear to him) he should not have; and therefore it was made sibi et heredibus suis regibus Angliæ, that by his decease, or attaining to the crown, it might be extinguished in the crown." ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{vision of}} the {{strengthened}} and perfected state is protagonist in my story. But as I re-read [...] "The Prince" [...] and thought out the manner of my now abandoned project, I came to perceive how that stir and whirl of human thought one calls by way of embodiment the French Revolution, has altered absolutely the approach to such a question. Machiavelli, like Plato and Pythagoras and Confucius two hundred odd decades before him, saw only one method by which a thinking man, himself not powerful, might {{do the work of}} state building, and that was by seizing the imagination of a Prince. Directly these men turned their thoughts towards realisation, their attitudes became--what shall I call it?--secretarial. Machiavelli, it is true, had some little doubts about the particular Prince he wanted, whether it was Caesar Borgia of Giuliano or Lorenzo, but a Prince it had to be. Before I saw clearly the differences of our own time I searched my mind for the modern equivalent of a Prince. At various times I redrafted a parallel dedication to the Prince of Wales, to the Emperor William, to Mr. Evesham, to a certain newspaper proprietor who was once my schoolfellow at City Merchants', to Mr. J. D. Rockefeller--all of them men in their several ways and circumstances and possibilities, princely. Yet in every case my pen bent of its own accord towards irony because--because, although at first I did not realise it, I myself am just as free to be a prince. The appeal was unfair. The old sort of Prince, the old little principality has vanished from the world. The commonweal is one man's <b>absolute</b> <b>estate</b> and responsibility no more. In Machiavelli's time it was indeed to an extreme degree one man's affair. But the days of the Prince who planned and directed and was the source and centre of all power are ended. We are in a condition of affairs infinitely more complex, in which every prince and statesman is something of a servant and every intelligent human being something of a Prince. No magnificent pensive Lorenzos remain any more in this world for secretarial hopes.|$|E

50|$|In English law, a {{fee simple}} or fee simple <b>absolute</b> is an <b>estate</b> in land, {{a form of}} {{freehold}} ownership. It is a way that real estate may be owned in common law countries, and is the highest possible ownership interest that can be held in real property. Allodial title is reserved to governments under a civil law structure. The rights of the fee simple owner are limited by government powers of taxation, compulsory purchase, police power, and escheat, and {{it could also be}} limited further by certain encumbrances or conditions in the deed, such as, for example, a condition that required the land {{to be used as a}} public park, with a reversion interest in the grantor if the condition fails; this is a fee simple conditional.|$|R
2500|$|Chilembwe’s Providence Industrial Mission was {{the closest}} one to Magomero, and built schools and churches on the estate. Livingstone was justifiably accused of {{destroying}} them, but Chilembwe himself deliberately provoked confrontation by erecting churches on private estate land, knowing that the estate owner did not want them built there, {{and it is clear}} that Livingstone had to act under orders from Bruce. Unlike the often brutal, sometimes generous William Jervis Livingstone, Bruce (who had <b>absolute</b> control over <b>estate</b> policy) had the consistent aim of making a profit from its operations. Bruce, whose view was that educated Africans had no place in colonial society and opposed their education, recorded his personal dislike for Chilembwe as an educated African. He considered Chilembwe's churches were centres for agitation, and that by building them on the estate, Chilembwe was making a claim to part of its land. [...] As Livingstone carried out the work of destruction, he, rather than Bruce, became a focus for Chilembwe’s grievances resulting in his tragic demise.|$|R

As a result, it was Livingstone rather than Bruce that became the focus for Chilembwe’s grievances, and he and two other of Bruce’s European employees {{were killed in the}} 1915 Chilembwe uprising.

5000|$|Prior to the {{industrial}} settlements of mills along the Patuxent river. The Gordon property was patented as part of Alexander and <b>Absolute</b> Warfieled's <b>estate</b> [...] "Warfield's Range" [...] which was resurveyed as [...] "Sappington's Sweep" [...] {{as part of an}} 1731 inheritance to Thomas Sappington from his grandfather Thomas Rutland. Route one was built along the property in 1749 which was operated as a turnpike from 1820-1865. In 1870, John and Elizabeth Water sold their interest in Sappington's sweep to William and Mary Cissel in 1890. The property was sold the same year for $35,000 to brothers Harry D. and Fulton R. Gordon from Bailey's Crossroads, who subdivided a tract on the Howard county side of the Patuxent river to form [...] "North Laurel". The business office for the development was operated out of an office on 918F Street in Washington as Gordon & Bro, marketing real estate in the [...] "suburbs" [...] between Baltimore and Washington. By 1894, the Gordon brothers sold a portion of [...] "North Laurel" [...] for $64,000 to the Key Brothers & Company to finance the purchase of the Lincoln Hotel in Washington D.C. Fulton Gordon divorced shortly afterward and declared himself broke. The brothers built an American Foursquare on [...] "Lot 10" [...] prior to 1905 sitting prominently along route one with a large stone retaining wall.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explain the changes in the real estate prices as well as in the real estate stock market prices, using some {{macro-economic}} explanatory variables, such as the gross domestic product (GDP), the real interest rate and the unemployment rate. Several regressions have been carried out in order to express some types of incremental and <b>absolute</b> deflated real <b>estate</b> lock market indexes in terms of the macro-economic variables. The analyses are applied to the Swedish economy. The period under study is 1984 - 1994. Time series on monthly data are used. i. e. the number of data-points is 132. If time leads/lags are introduced in the e regressions, significant improvements in the already high correlations are achieved. The signs of the coefficients for IR, UE and GDP are all what one would expect to see from an economic point of view: those for GDP are all positive, those for both IR and UE are negative. All the regressions have high R 2 values. Both markets anticipate change in the unemployment rate by 6 to 9 months, which seems reasonable because such change can be forecast quite reliably. But, on the contrary, there is no reason why they should anticipate by 3 - 6 months changes in the interest rate that can hardly be reliably forecast so far in advance...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} intensity of concern between growth and distribution has now gone full circle. The achievement {{of a high}} rate of economic growth, the major emphasis of the development strategy, that reached its peak in the "decade of development" in the 1960 s, ceded its place of priority to redistribution and eradication of mass poverty in the 1970 s. A backswing of this emphasis, from redistribution to growth and from direct distributional measures to the "trickle-down", has been evident since late 1970 s. The world has once again brought the objective of growth to the forefront and redistribution to a relatively low priority. The present study is carried out {{in the context of this}} changing emphasis of growth and distribution. This study analyses the pattern of income distribution and poverty in Sri Lanka over the last three decades using income and consumption data gathered from four nationwide surveys of 1963, 73, 79 and 82. The study adopts an analytical approach, distribution of incomes are examined using two types of disaggregation, by economic sectors and ethnic groups. Standard summary and descriptive measures of income inequality are employed. Poverty is analyzed using two poverty lines; absolute versus relative. Separate poverty lines are defined for three major socioeconomic regions: urban, rural and <b>estate.</b> <b>Absolute</b> poverty lines are defined on the basis of chosen basic needs, and relative poverty lines on the basis of overall living standards of the community. Relative inequality of incomes in Sri Lanka declined between 1963 - 73 and worsened after 1973. The changes are broad based; inequality of size distribution of personal, family [spending units] and per capita incomes declined between 1963 - 73 and increased between 1973 - 82. A similar change in the income inequality was evident among all ethnic groups and within major industrial sectors. This change in the pattern of income distribution is not merely a statistical artifact. It has been accompanied by significant changes in the living standards of the lower income groups. This inference emerges from the analysis of the incidence of absolute poverty. The percentage in absolute poverty in the economy, as well as within three major socio-economic regions, [urban, rural and estate], declined significantly between 1963 - 73. Between 1973 - 79 and 79 - 82 the opposite occurred, the incidence of absolute poverty increased, with such increases most pronounced between 1973 - 79. The change in the relative poverty however, was less pronounced during this period. The changes are explained by referring to the development strategy and growth patterns of the economy. In contrast to many of the suggestions in literature, Sri Lankan experience indicates that the pattern of distribution of incomes of an economy is influenced largely by the policy measures rather than the growth per se. Finally, the results suggest that the shift from redistribution to 'trickle-down' which occurred during the latter part of the 1970 s has brought increased economic inequalities among the Sri Lankan population in general, and an absolute impoverishment among the lower income groups in particular...|$|R
