25|$|According to the transtheoretical {{model of}} {{behavior}} change, {{also known as}} the stages of change model, states that there are five stages towards behavior change. The five stages, between which individuals may transition before achieving complete change, are precontemplation, contemplation, preparation for action, action, and maintenance. At the precontemplation stage, an individual {{may or may not be}} aware of a problem but has no thought of changing their behavior. From precontemplation to contemplation, the individual begins thinking about changing a certain behavior. During preparation, the individual begins his plans for change, and during the <b>action</b> <b>stage</b> the individual begins to exhibit new behavior consistently. An individual finally enters the maintenance stage once they exhibit the new behavior consistently for over six months. A problem faced with the stages of change model is that it is very easy for a person to enter the maintenance stage and then fall back into earlier stages. Factors that contribute to this decline include external factors such as weather or seasonal changes, and/or personal issues a person is dealing with.|$|E

500|$|In {{terms of}} technology, Hashimoto remarked that the visual style was {{born out of}} desire to see a global {{illumination}} solution used for the game's lighting — that is, light reflecting from one object in the scene onto others. To this extent, development on the renderer for this process began, and the final solution allowed the developers to use distributed rendering over hundreds of computers to calculate lighting for each ten- to twenty-kilometer <b>action</b> <b>stage</b> in around two or three days. Characters, enemies and objects are then lit at run-time with Sonic Team's [...] "Light Field" [...] technology to blend them in with the surrounding pre-calculated lighting. Because the game was being developed for two levels of hardware capability depending on the target platform, two development [...] "silos" [...] were set up to work on two separate builds of the game: one for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version utilizing the Hedgehog Engine, and one for the PlayStation 2 and Wii version, which instead utilizes a modified version of an existing, internal Sega engine. Hashimoto, who had never directed a Sonic game before, incorporated new features such as a [...] "Quick Step" [...] mechanic allowing players to dodge obstacles with the L and R triggers. Hashimoto sought to combine the best qualities of 2D and 3D Sonic gameplay and address the criticisms directed at previous 3D entries in the franchise. Additional code to dynamically adjust the speed of the game for different situations was used to properly balance its fast pace with traditional platforming elements.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{application}} of the transtheoretical model (Prochaska and DiClemente 1992) to dietary change is investigated. Four studies were conducted examining the core constructs of the model these are (a) stages of change, (b) processes of change, (c) concepts of change. An exploratory cross sectional study found that process and concept use differed significantly between precontemplaters and post <b>action</b> <b>stages.</b> With self efficacy however the main differences were between preparation and other stages. Semi-structured interviews with then conducted with 20 participants in the process of improving their dietary behaviour. Results showed that strategies similar to those outlined in the transtheoretical model social support and consciousness raising were strongly emphasised, regarding decisional balance more benefits than disadvantages were associated with dietary change. Following this a 6 -month longitudinal study tested the effectiveness of stage matched and general pamphlets for clients with type two diabetes. 955 participants completed questionnaires with 327 participants receiving stage matched interventions, 309 receiving general interventions and 319 participants being allocated to a control group, intervention copies were distributed at 3 months and a second questionnaire at six months. Significant {{differences were found between the}} pre action and post <b>action</b> <b>stages</b> with low fat dietary behaviour. Precontemplaters scored significantly lower than other stages with all processes and with the pros and cons of decisional balance and contemplaters scored lower than post <b>action</b> <b>stages</b> with several processes. Maintainers scored highest in self efficacy. The use of processes and concepts did not match fully that outlined in the transtheoretical model. Interestingly when participants were classified on the basis of low, medium and high fat behaviour, process and concept use followed a broadly linear pattern. At follow up detailed analysis was made problematic by high subject attrition. However, higher scores in consciousness raising were associated with forward stage movement and low scores in social support with retrograde movement. There was no significant difference in effectiveness of stage matched and general pamphlets. There is, however, weak evidence that interventions in general improve low fat dietary behaviour. The stage classification may however give insights not available with standard classifications. Indicating advantages in combining stage and traditional classifications. Suggestions for future studies to investigate the model more thoroughly are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{physical activity}} stages of change, physical activity behavior, and role overload in {{different stages of}} motherhood in a predominantly Australian sample. Neither physical activity behavior, stages of physical activity change, nor role overload significantly differed across motherhood groups. Role overload was significantly higher for mothers in the contemplation, planning, and <b>action</b> <b>stages</b> of physical activity than in the maintenance stage of change. Role overload had a weak, although significant, negative correlation with leisure-time physical activity. We conclude that strategies focused upon reducing role overload or perceived role overload have only limited potential to meaningfully increase leisure-time physical activity in mothers...|$|R
