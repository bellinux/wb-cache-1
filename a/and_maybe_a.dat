Quaid's son {{convinced him to}} take on the part, and the filmmakers enjoyed working with him so much, Stuart Beattie wrote [...] "10 to 15 more scenes" [...] for the character. He filmed all his scenes within the first two months of production.|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{problems}} {{occurred in}} the first race. The leading mushers had to break trail because the snowmobile intended for the task broke down. Trail markers often were absent or misplaced, and no preparations had been made for racers in Dawson City until organizer Roger Williams flew there shortly after the race began. After Dawson City, mushers had their dogs and sleds trucked [...] to avoid a section of snowless trail, then {{had to deal with}} open sections of the Yukon River near Whitehorse due to above-average temperatures. The eventual winner of the inaugural race, Sonny Lindner, was greeted with little fanfare on his arrival. On the race's 25th anniversary, he recalled, [...] "I think it was 90percent (camping) trip <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> little bit of racing." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on Primary Colours often {{focus on}} mundane topics {{pertaining}} {{to the lives of}} ordinary people, including watching TV and eating ice cream, while its music often features shredding power chords. According to The Washington Posts Chris Richards, the music represents a new, gentler type of punk rock in the vein of No Age and Abe Vigoda. Richards also wrote that Suppression [...] " [...] these upbeat rock tunes from becoming too saccharine with a nervy delivery that's part David Byrne, part Iggy Pop". A similar sentiment was expressed by David Bevan of Pitchfork Media, who wrote [...] "there's a softening of edges taking place throughout, a band testing limits after having already refined them". He also described it as an [...] "artfully polished extension of its predecessor". Current described the album as [...] "a bit more '82ish than the '76ish sound of our first LP, slightly less frantic <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> bit more palatable".|$|E

500|$|James Montgomery of MTV News {{said that}} the song seemed [...] "tailor-made" [...] for him, playing on the {{strengths}} {{that led him to}} win American Idol. Montgomery also said, [...] "his husky, broad voice, shuffly guitar playing and genuinely sweet disposition – and wraps them in a well-worn, subtly sexy tune, full of wide-eyed, dare we say inspirational sentiments. Yet, at the same time, it's also incredibly earnest in tone." [...] Misha Berson of the Seattle Times described the song as [...] "surprising, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> little jarring at first, if you expected a ballad or a mellow groove with a spare arrangement, like some of Allen's best performances on American Idol that paved the way to his Season 8 win". [...] In spite of Berson's initial surprise at the song's sound, she went on to praise the single as [...] "very catchy, a bit inspirational", and [...] "energetic". She praised the chorus and further commended the song as [...] "a marked improvement over what some Idol winners have put out as their first post-show single".|$|E
500|$|In {{one of the}} few {{contemporaneous}} accounts, the Toledo Blade {{wrote that}} the Penn players, knowing that Schulz was [...] "the power in the Michigan game", focused their energy on wearing him down. [...] There were two Penn players who [...] "did nothing but look after Schultz". [...] And they did more than look: [...] "In every scrimmage, he was bumped as hard as the rules allowed, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> little harder, when nobody was looking.... Every time Schultz started anywhere he would find a couple of Penn men digging headfirst into his stomach. [...] They would elbow him, jam him with the straight arm, and if he went to the ground in a scrimmage there generally would be a knee grinding him in the wind. [...] Pretty soon Schultz began to show it.... He limped along pitifully. [...] He couldn't run. [...] His strength was almost gone. [...] When he did tackle, his groan of pain could almost be heard in the stands". [...] But the fans continued to urge Schulz with yells of [...] "G-r-r-r-r-rah, Schultz!" [...] Schulz buckled down and continued to play, and the pummeling continued.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from The Honolulu Advertiser {{called it}} [...] "A smart script," [...] with [...] "slick production values <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> splash of nostalgia got the remake of Hawaii Five-O {{placed on the}} CBS prime-time lineup this fall, {{but it will take}} more than beefcake and a remixed theme song to keep the show on the air." [...] The piece also pointed out that times have changed since the original series left the air, citing other shows that were set in Hawaii which have come and gone. It expressed a hope that the producers will succeed in bringing a new life to the title with this remake. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly graded the episode B+, calling it an [...] "unexpected pleasure," [...] and praised Caan for being [...] "terrific as the moody but excellent" [...] Danno. Tucker also believed that Kim and Park [...] "play off each other nicely." [...] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times felt that the script was [...] "neatly balanced between action, clever banter and serious issues," [...] adding that it [...] "seems poised to hold its own in the modern age." [...] McNamara also liked O'Loughlin's performance, stating that his [...] "limpid-eye woodenness" [...] worked well for the role. Hanh Nguyen of Zap2it stated that it was [...] "damn entertaining" [...] and [...] "visually stimulating," [...] and enjoyed the chemistry between McGarrett and Danny.|$|E

While the other residents were running around trying to get information, she was so busy working on the free clinic project that she hadn’t even heard he was retiring." [...] The story of the two Amish girls was deemed [...] "a little side story, which was actually quite touching and well written", being praised for the realistic portrayals and the effects the storyline had on Stevens. [...] "I don't think I've ever realized that Callie and Cristina never really interacted before. When they did speak to one another the episode, their personalities clash right away. At first they were snippy to one another but the two bonded after slicing open a runner's legs and then operating on him.", assessed West, in {{response to}} Torres and Yang's arc, which was described as [...] "an obvious parallel {{to the rest of the}} episode". West compared the reaction of Yang and Torres following the proposals, by noting that the former was [...] "surprised <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> little bit touched", whereas Torres expressed fear and concern: [...] "She's worried that he's only proposing because he's still getting over the loss of his dad and just needs someone to cling to. I adore George, but he's a mess right now and needs to get stuff straightened out before he makes any lifelong commitments." ...|$|E
500|$|Micevski, the album's producer, is {{also one}} of the people who had had a long-time {{professional}} relationship with the singer and who had contributed for the arrangement of the songs included on Makedonsko Devojče (2008); the start of the professional ties with Gočeva began when he joined her live band which performed during her concerts in the past. He said that due to the mutual understanding between the two of them, the process of setting a music direction with the album was without any difficulties, but moved slowly because of their intention to create high quality material. During an interview with the journal Republika, Micevski said that his work on Makedonsko Devojče 2 represented both responsibility and pressure to a certain extent. He elaborated that the requirement with the album was to create something that would resemble the first project, but will not be identical to it and would maintain the same level of quality or even surpass it. He added: [...] "To me, that represented a big challenge <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> life chance to express myself differently, uniquely, with a different mark, with all my knowledge and spirit. It was an additional pleasure working with my close friend and collaborator Dejan Momirovski... In the end we all managed to do what we had had in mind." [...] Micevski also revealed that the songs included on the album were originally custom-made for Gočeva, adapted to her vocal capabilities and musical maturity, adding that she is a [...] "world performer" [...] and a singer who can sing in different styles: [...] "She can simply find her way anywhere and she does it on a very high level. The mark she left on the material of 'Makedonsko Devojče 1 and 2' is a really unique, original style of performance which leaves traces in the history of Macedonian vocal-instrumental music." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, he co-starred with Michelle Williams in Derek Cianfrance's directorial debut, {{the marital}} drama Blue Valentine. The low-budget film was mainly improvised and Gosling has said [...] "you {{had to remind}} {{yourself}} you were making a film". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt he [...] "brings a preternatural understanding of people to his performance" [...] while A.O. Scott of The New York Times found him [...] "convincing as the run-down, desperate, older Dean, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> bit less so as the younger version". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly noted that he [...] "plays Dean as a snarky working-class hipster, but when his anger is unleashed, the performance turns powerful." [...] However, Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe felt the performance {{was an example of}} [...] "hipsterism misdirected". He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. The film was a box office success, grossing over $12 million worldwide from a production budget of $1 million. Gosling's second on-screen appearance of 2010 was in the mystery film All Good Things with Kirsten Dunst, based on a true story. He played the role of New York real-estate heir Robert Durst, who was investigated for the disappearance of his wife (played by Dunst). Gosling found the filming process to be a [...] "dark experience" [...] and did not undertake any promotional duties for the film. When asked if he was proud of the film, he replied, [...] "I'm proud of what Kirsten does in the movie." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone felt he [...] "gets so deep into character you can feel his nerve endings." [...] Mick La Salle of the San Francisco Chronicle found the [...] "chameleonic Gosling is completely convincing as this empty shell of a man". Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt that the film belonged to Dunst, but noted that Gosling [...] "is good too". The film grossed $644,535 worldwide.|$|E

In a September 2010 interview, Seppälä defines their music: [...] "Amberian Dawn's music is melodic metal, and the roots lie in the Metal and Rock music of the 70s and 80s <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> little bit of the '90s.

Amongst the hundreds in attendance was car owner Melvin Jarvis, who drove to the service in a full-scale replica of Lady Penelope's Rolls-Royce FAB1. Also in attendance was Shane Rimmer, who voiced Scott Tracy in Thunderbirds; he spoke about his time on the show, saying, [...] "It was a truly unique experience. Gerry's office was like the Oval Office at The White House at times, such was the mystique of the place. Thunderbirds really broke a mould as {{it was one of}} the first TV shows that had appeal on both sides of the Atlantic." [...] He also went on to add about the [...] "ground-breaking energy and vision" [...] that Anderson had, going on to say [...] "Gerry was an exceptional man – not only to those who began the studio work with him, and they were all terribly talented and so easy to work with – but also to the hundreds of thousands of young, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> little older, viewers who watched that magic flow across television screens all over the world.
