25|$|Today, only 51% of the Deerwood {{residents}} {{are members of}} the Country Club. Part of that is financial; the equity initiation fee was $21,000 in 2005, with monthly dues of $349 for a golf membership. However, there are about 100 non-residents who are Deerwood Country Club members. When the Deerwood Board of Governors made the decision to build a new clubhouse and renovate the golf course at a cost estimated at $9.5 million, <b>all</b> <b>Equity</b> members were assessed a fee to pay for it. Membership dropped from 700 in 2000 to approximately 500 in January 2004, when the project began. Approximately 25% of the members did not pay it, leaving the club with a $6M debt.|$|E

25|$|Despite late {{attempts}} to develop Ndix, ND never succeeded at entering the Unix market which started to dominate {{in the late}} 1980s. The company's share value halved on 19 October 1987 and never recovered. The company went {{through a series of}} reorganizations, but the company never succeeded at making money on open systems and the last area with profits was sales to existing Sintran customers. From 1988 the company was gradually split up; parts were sold to foreign competitors while others were spun off as subsidiaries or sold. By 1993 <b>all</b> <b>equity</b> had been lost and the remaining parts of the company sold off or taken over by the creditors. The main parts of company were bought by Telenor.|$|E

Others corrupting religion, as these have perverted philosophy, contend, that Christians are redeemed into captivity; and the blood of the Saviour of mankind has been shed to make them the slaves of a few proud and insolent sinners.

6000|$|I need {{say no more}} on {{the insult}} offered not only to <b>all</b> <b>equity</b> and justice, but to the common sense of mankind, in {{deciding}} legal property by physical principles, and establishing the convenience of a party {{as a rule of}} public law. The noble advocate for peace has, indeed, perfectly well exploded this daring and outrageous system of pride and tyranny. I am most happy in commending him, when he writes like himself. But hear still further and in the same good strain the great patron and advocate of amity with this accommodating, mild, and unassuming power, when he reports to you the law they give, and its immediate effects:--"They amount," [...] says he, [...] "to the sacrifice of powers that have been the most nearly connected with us,--the direct or indirect annexation to France of all the ports of the Continent from Dunkirk to Hamburg,--an immense accession of territory,--and, in one word, THE ABANDONMENT OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF EUROPE!" [...] This is the LAW (the author and I use no different terms) which this new government, almost as soon as it could cry in the cradle, and as one of the very first acts by which it auspicated its entrance into function, the pledge it gives of the firmness of its policy,--such is the law that this proud power prescribes to abject nations. What is the comment upon this law by the great jurist who recommends us to the tribunal which issued the decree? [...] "An obedience to it would be" [...] (says he) [...] "dishonorable to us, and exhibit us to the present age and to posterity as submitting to the law prescribed to us by our enemy." ...|$|E

6000|$|But the {{independence}} of a drunken shoemaker is proverbial, and Morrison's meek spirit soared into lordly arrogance with his earliest cups. The first warning which the community had of his change of attitude was the conspicuous and even defiant closure of his shop, and the scornful rejection of custom, however urgent or necessitous. <b>All</b> <b>Equity</b> might go in broken shoes, for any patching or half-soling the people got from him. He went about collecting his small dues, and paying up his debts {{as long as the}} money lasted, in token of his resolution not to take any favors from any man thereafter. Then he retired to his house on one of the by streets, and by degrees drank himself past active offence. It was of course in his defiant humor that he came to visit Bartley, who had learned to expect him whenever Hannah failed to appear promptly at her work. The affair was always easily arranged. Bartley instantly assented, with whatever irony he liked, to Morrison's demands; he refused with overwhelming politeness even to permit him to give himself the trouble to support them by argument; he complimented Hannah inordinately {{as one of the most}} gifted and accomplished ladies of his acquaintance, and inquired affectionately after the health of each member of the Morrison family. When Morrison rose to go he always said, in shaking hands, [...] "Well, sir, if there was more like you in Equity a poor man could get along. You're a gentleman, sir." [...] After getting some paces away from the street door, he stumbled back up the stairs to repeat, [...] "You're a gentleman!" [...] Hannah came during the day, and the wages remained the same: neither of the contracting parties regarded the increase so elaborately agreed upon, and Morrison, on becoming sober, gratefully ignored the whole transaction, though, by a curious juggle of his brain, he recurred to it in his next spree, and advanced in his new demand from the last rise: his daughter was now nominally in receipt of an income of forty dollars a week, but actually accepted four.|$|E
