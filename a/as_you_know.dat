5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

We are a new government from diverse backgrounds without links to former colonial interests. My own origins are Irish and, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> we were colonised, not colonisers.|$|E

25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing as long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> exactly what you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E

That's almost 30 more years. I'm very optimistic.” ...|$|E
500|$|It {{is up to}} Solidarity... {{to define}} the aid they need. [...] Solidarity made its needs known, with courage, with clarity, and publicly. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> the AFL–CIO responded by {{establishing}} a fund {{for the purchase of}} equipment requested by Solidarity and we have raised {{about a quarter of a}} million dollars for that fund.|$|E

It may seem {{dangerous}} to hunt with just a twelve-inch Bowie knife, but Kolb, assured the public, [...] "Our dogs go and find 'em first, and then we stab the pigs.

500|$|The {{political}} website [...] "Political Realm" [...] {{summed up}} Tancredo's campaign profile {{with the statement}} that [...] "In the end, Tancredo is a single-issue candidate and that will not be enough to carry him over the top." [...] Tancredo himself acknowledged that he is a one-issue candidate making the statement at a speech in to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), [...] "If you want to call me a single-issue candidate, that's fine, just so long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that my single issue is the survival and the success of the conservative movement in America." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis' given {{names are}} Isaac and Benjamin (after his mother's two grandfathers). [...] Although Davis does not {{practice}} Judaism and is non-religious, he stated: [...] "I am {{really proud of}} my Jewish heritage" [...] and describes himself as [...] "culturally Jewish." [...] He reflected: [...] "It's funny about Judaism; It doesn’t matter if you're ultra-religious or not, as long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that it's in you or you're a part of it, everyone accepts you." [...] He often uses the Jewish greeting [...] "shalom". [...] Davis states: [...] "I'm glad Jewish kids get to see they can {{grow up to be}} professional baseball players." [...] Davis followed four other players of Jewish heritage on the Mets: Art Shamsky, Shawn Green, Scott Schoeneweis, and Josh Satin.|$|E

500|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is a motion-based dark ride {{located in}} The Wizarding World of Harry Potter themed areas of Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida, Universal Studios Hollywood in Universal City, California, and Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, Japan. The ride takes guests through scenes and environments {{in and around}} Hogwarts Castle from the Harry Potter series of books and films. Mark Woodbury, {{president}} of Universal Creative, described the ride as an in-depth {{look at the world}} of Harry Potter, which utilizes never-before-seen technology which transforms [...] "the theme park experience <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it". The ride first opened at Islands of Adventure with The Wizarding World of Harry Potter on June 18, 2010, at Universal Studios Japan on July 15, 2014, and at Universal Studios Hollywood on April 7, 2016.|$|E
500|$|Universal {{appealed the}} verdict to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Nintendo and Universal argued the appeals case on May 23, 1984. As {{evidence}} of consumer confusion, Universal presented {{the results of}} a telephone survey of 150 managers and owners of arcades, bowling alleys, and pizza restaurants who owned or leased Donkey Kong machines. To the question [...] "To the best of your knowledge, was the Donkey Kong game made with the approval or under the authority of the people who produce the King Kong movies?", 18% of those surveyed answered in the affirmative. However, to the question [...] "As far <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> who makes Donkey Kong?", no one named Universal. Universal argued that this was enough evidence to show that consumers were confused about the distinction between the two names.|$|E
500|$|... "Desperate Souls" [...] partly {{deals with}} the {{aftermath}} of Sheriff Graham's death from the previous episode. Though her character is associated with evil, actress Lana Parrilla attempted to keep Regina as human as possible. She clarified, [...] "You will see how there is a genuine love and care for Graham…There was a physical connection to the character. He did become sort of a boy toy in both worlds. But, you know, {{at the end of}} the day, in Storybrooke, she’s still trying to fill this void that Maleficent warned her about." [...] Leading up to the episode broadcast, Parrilla also gave a preview of what viewers could expect. Of the episode's plot, she explained, [...] "We will be seeing some dirty politics between Regina and Mr. Gold. You’re going to see how threatening that is to Regina, and, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> she really takes on these challenges full force." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{her second}} Hollywood role, Thompson starred with John Travolta in Mike Nichols's Primary Colors (1998), playing a couple based on Bill and Hillary Clinton. Thompson's character, Susan, is {{described}} as that of an [...] "ambitious, long-suffering wife" [...] who {{has to deal with}} her husband's infidelity. The film was critically well received but lost money at the box office. According to Kevin O'Sullivan of the Daily Mirror, Americans were [...] "blown away" [...] by her performance and accent, and top Hollywood producers became increasingly interested in casting her. Thompson rejected many of the offers, expressing concerns about living in Los Angeles behind walls with bodyguards, and stated [...] "LA is lovely as long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> you can leave". She also admitted to feeling tired and jaded with the industry at this point, which influenced her decision to leave film for a year. Thompson followed Primary Colors by playing an FBI agent opposite Rickman in the poorly received thriller Judas Kiss (1998).|$|E
500|$|On January 22, 2014, and {{initially}} reported by media outlets the day before, Dunderdale {{announced that she}} would be resigning as Premier on January 24, 2014. In her speech Dunderdale stated [...] "Just <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> when it's time to step up, you also know when it is time to step back, and that time for me is now." [...] The announcement followed the defection of PC MHA Paul Lane to the Liberal Party, and months of poor performance in opinion polls. Dunderdale's Finance Minister Tom Marshall was sworn in [...] as premier and became the interim party leader on January 24. [...] Marshall will hold the post until the PC Party selects a permanent leader. On February 28, 2014, Dunderdale sent out a news releasing announcing she was resigning as the MHA for Virginia Water {{by the end of the}} day, ending a ten and a half year career in provincial politics. She subsequently returned to community work gaining employment with Gathering Place as their volunteer coordinator.|$|E
500|$|Various plotlines leaked {{before the}} episode's release, {{the most notable}} being {{the death of the}} Lone Gunmen. The choice to kill off the trio was controversial; Gilligan himself later {{admitted}} that [...] "I still think we made the wrong choice on that one." [...] Spotnitz later said, [...] "I can't say I regret killing them off, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> no one really dies in The X-Files [...] But I do feel tonally {{it was a mistake to}} end the episode on such a somber note. I wish we'd ended it on a laugh or smile." [...] The actors who played The Lone Gunmen complimented the script. Harwood admitted that the episode would have either featured the trio's death or would have featured them [...] "walk off into the sunset without hobo bags over our shoulders." [...] Ultimately, he concluded that [...] "I was glad we were killed off in the end". Dean Haglund said that he [...] "liked the way we were sent off", and called the ending [...] "cool".|$|E

6000|$|... "You didn't suppose I {{had asked}} her?" [...] The point was {{positively}} that she didn't; yet {{it made us}} {{look at each other}} almost as hard as if she did.

500|$|In 1915, the {{children}} of an unknown family living in a Devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in {{the lack of a}} sequel to Mr. Tod. Potter enjoyed continuing the lives of her characters through these letters and responded:It is sad to have caused such disappointment! [...] I think I saw Tommy Brock's wife last week. I couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and when I read your letter I remembered directly! I am not sure how many of a family there are [...] lots! and what we call a [...] "long" [...] family, all ages with some long time between. I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown-up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; and, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> he is not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not particularly clean house, I should say [...] she finishes wearing out Tommy's celebrated boots. Mr. Tod has been across lately, I smelt him myself; but he had removed before the hounds came.|$|E
500|$|Criticism of Irwin's career {{following}} his death came from Dan Mathews, vice-president {{of the animal}} rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Comparing Irwin to a [...] "cheap reality TV star", Mathews accused him of [...] "antagonising frightened wild animals ... a very dangerous message to send to children", contrasted his methods with the behaviour of [...] "a responsible conservationist like Jacques Cousteau", {{and said it was}} [...] "no shock at all that Steve Irwin should die provoking a dangerous animal." [...] The son of Jacques Cousteau, Jean-Michel Cousteau—also a producer of wildlife documentaries—took issue with Irwin's [...] "very, very spectacular, dramatic way of presenting things" [...] and suggested instead that [...] "You don't touch nature, you just look at it." [...] Jacques Cousteau's grandson and Jean-Michel's nephew, Philippe Cousteau Jr., on the other hand, called Irwin [...] "a remarkable individual"; describing the Ocean's Deadliest project (on which he worked along with Irwin), Philippe said, [...] "I think why Steve was so excited about it that we were looking at these animals that people think of <b>as,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> dangerous and deadly monsters, and they're not. They all have an important place in the environment and in the world. And that was what his whole message was about." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Mikhail Vinogradov, one of {{the leading}} staff members of the Serbsky Center, {{strongly}} degraded the human rights movement of the Soviet era in every possible way and tried to convince that all political dissidents who had been to his institution were indeed mentally ill. In his opinion, [...] "now it is clear that all of them are deeply affected people." [...] In 2012, Vinogradov said the same, [...] "Do you talk about human rights activists? Most of them are just unhealthy people, I talked with them. As for the dissident General Grigorenko, I too saw him, kept him under observation, and noted oddities of his thinking. But he was eventually allowed to go abroad, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>know...</b> Who? Bukovsky? I talked with him, and he is a completely crazy character. But he too was allowed to go abroad! You see, human rights activists are people who, due to their mental pathology, are unable to restrain themselves within the standards of society, and the West encourages their inability to do so." [...] In the same year, he offered to restore Soviet mental health law and said it [...] "has never been used for political persecution." [...] Human rights activists who claim it did, in Vinogradov's words, [...] "are not very mentally healthy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{what you}} call very much. I'm not so old <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> Everything must have a beginning." [...] Mr. Dobbes wished [...] "the beginning" [...] might have taken place elsewhere; {{but there had been}} some truth in the remark.|$|R
