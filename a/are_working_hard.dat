Q {{referred to it as}} [...] "by some margin Daft Punk's best album in a career that's already redefined dance music at least twice. It is, in short, a mind blower." [...] The Independent stated, [...] "Random Access Memories breathes life into the safe music that dominates today’s charts, with its sheer ambition…It's an exciting journey, and one that, for all its musical twists and turns, has its feet planted on the dancefloor." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "a headphones album in an age of radio singles; a bravura live performance that stands out against pro forma knob-twiddling; a jazzy disco attack on the basic house beat; a full collaboration {{at a time when the}} superstar DJ stands alone." [...] She concluded her review by saying that [...] "if EDM is turning humans into robots, Daft Punk <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>hard</b> to make robot pop feel human again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michigan Tech hosted Wisconsin for a two-game series the {{following}} weekend {{to open its}} WCHA conference schedule, but did so without junior defenseman Tommy Brown, who underwent an appendectomy that week. Pearson wanted his team to play with more discipline so as to limit the Badgers' power play chances, and the Huskies responded by taking one penalty through the first two periods of the Friday game. Michigan Tech freshman Tanner Kero opened the scoring {{in the second period}} with his first career goal by deflecting a shot from Riley Sweeney. In the third period, however, the Huskies incurred two consecutive penalties in the first seven minutes, and Wisconsin forward Tyler Barnes beat Josh Robinson for a power play goal. The Huskies outshot the Badgers 16–8 in the third period, but could not put the puck past Landon Peterson to win the game in regulation. Nearly three minutes into the overtime period, Michigan Tech started a dump-and-chase and Peterson stopped the puck behind his net, but he collided with teammate John Ramage while the Huskies forechecked, leaving Jordan Baker to score on an undefended goal and win the game. In the Saturday game, Wisconsin started Joel Rumpel at goaltender and Huskies forwards Kero and Blake Pietila each scored a power play goal on a deflection. Midway through the second period, Wisconsin scored off a rebound after Robinson stopped the initial shot. Michigan Tech killed off a five-minute major penalty to Alex MacLeod in the third period, but the Badgers tied the game with two minutes remaining. Twenty seconds into overtime, however, Huskies captain Brett Olson scored on a wrap-around shot that went through Rumpel's five-hole for the win. Pearson was pleased with his team's performance, saying, [...] "Our kids <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>hard,</b> there's {{a lot of good things}} going on in our locker room and we see it every day as coaches". Robinson was named WCHA Defensive Player of the Week after stopping 44 of 47shots in the series.|$|E

The man of the Fancy Repository and Brompton Emporium of Fine Arts (of whom she bought the screens, vainly hoping that he would repurchase them when ornamented by her hand) can hardly hide the sneer with which he examines these feeble works of art. He looks askance at the lady who waits in the shop, and ties up the cards again in their envelope of whitey-brown paper, and hands them to the poor widow and Miss Clapp, who had never seen such beautiful things in her life, and had been quite confident that the man must give at least two guineas for the screens. They try at other shops in the interior of London, with faint sickening hopes. [...] "Don't want 'em," [...] says one. [...] "Be off," [...] says another fiercely. Three-and-sixpence has been spent in vain--the screens retire to Miss Clapp's bedroom, who persists in thinking them lovely.|$|E
