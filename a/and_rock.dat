40|$|Abstract Many {{empirical}} scaling equations {{have been}} developed for scaling Fou-rier spectrum amplitudes of strong earthquake accelerations and for generation of artificial strong-motion accelerograms for the translational, torsional, <b>and</b> <b>rocking</b> components of strong motion. It has also been shown that rotational components of strong motion significantly contribute to the overall response of structures; how-ever, little {{progress has been made in}} the development and deployment of strong-motion instruments to measure rotations. This article presents a simple approximate algorithm for generating torsional <b>and</b> <b>rocking</b> Fourier spectral amplitudes from the corresponding translational motions. The method can be used to generate torsion <b>and</b> <b>rocking</b> spectra from the translational Fourier spectra of actual records. Inverse Fourier transform can be used to generate torsional <b>and</b> <b>rocking</b> time histories...|$|R
