25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} with some of my friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of the album, Madonna was {{dismissed}} by some critics. They called her voice sounding as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium", while the other detractors suggested that she was [...] "almost entirely helium, a gas-filled, lighter-than-air creation of MTV and other sinister media packagers." [...] Madonna said: [...] "From the very beginning of my career, people have been writing shit about me and saying, 'She's a one-hit wonder, she'll disappear after a year'." [...] She responded to the comment [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium" [...] by doing a photoshoot with Alberto Tolot, where she flirted with a giant Mickey Mouse toy, putting its hand inside her dress and looking at it with an admonishing glare. Author Debbi Voller noted that [...] "such provocative imagery at a young age of her career, could have hurt her too much. But it went on to shut those twerps who dared to take a swag at her voice again." [...] Twenty-five years later, in her acceptance speech of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Madonna thanked the critics who snubbed her in the early years, [...] "The ones that said I was talentless, that I was chubby, that I couldn't sing, that I was a one-hit wonder. They pushed me to be better, and I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> their resistance." ...|$|E

500|$|Stevenage's league {{campaign}} {{got off to}} {{a typically}} patchy start; with the side recording just one win from their first five games of the season. Following a 2–1 defeat to Oxford United in August 2009, the team went on a 17-game unbeaten run that stretched four months from August to December 2009, propelling the club into the top two. Unlike in previous seasons, the club were performing strongly away from home, and secured victories at the likes of Luton Town and Mansfield Town. A 4–1 victory against Cambridge United on New Year's Day ultimately meant that Stevenage hit top-spot {{for the first time in}} the season. However, two defeats on the road within the space of a week in February meant that rivals Oxford United had an eight–point lead going into March 2010. The team responded well, winning eight games on the bounce; including an important 1–0 victory over Oxford United in late March, subsequently replacing Oxford at the top of the table. Borough brushed aside a late challenge from Luton Town, securing promotion to the Football League with two games to spare following a 2–0 win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough. The team won their last six games of the league campaign without conceding a single goal, and recorded 42 points from a possible 45 from their last 15 league fixtures. Stevenage finished the season having amassed a total of 99 points from 44 games, winning the league by 11 points, with Westley winning many plaudits for the way he had secured promotion despite considerably less resources than a lot of the teams in the division. The promotion means Westley has led Stevenage to the Football League for the first time in their history, as well as managing a Football League team for the first time in his managerial career. Westley also guided the club to another FA Trophy Final; this time losing 2–1 after extra-time against Barrow at Wembley Stadium. At the end of the season, Westley signed a new two-year contract; keeping him contracted to the club until 2012. On signing the new deal, Westley said [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> all the support that we have all been given in the past two years. I am delighted to have the opportunity to manage the launch of the club into the Football League". In his first two seasons back at the club, from May 2008 to May 2010, Westley has been in charge for 114 games, winning a total of 70 games – recording a win percentage of 61.40%.|$|E

[...] Sangay added that the Tibetan people are immensely grateful to the US for applauding and supporting a [...] "middle-way" [...] approach and encouraging dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Chinese authorities to lower tensions and resolve our differences.|$|E

[...] In May 2007, Haim publicly declared his support for Clinton in 2008 presidential election. In June 2007, Saban and Steven Spielberg co-hosted a Hillary Clinton fundraiser {{at the house of}} Peter Chernin, the President of News Corporation. According to the Los Angeles Times, the fundraiser brought in over $850,000.|$|E

2500|$|Members of Occupy Harvard {{used the}} encampment as a {{platform}} to create discussion about the university {{and its role in}} the world. Many criticized Harvard's role in the global economy (and crisis therein): [...] "Year after year, Harvard supplies traders and analysts and financial advisers who go on to run the economy into the ground", said one participating graduate student. Occupiers also criticized finances within the university. Said one doctoral student studying slavery, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> what the school has given me, but the lack of transparency about where all that lovely money comes from is something I do not feel comfortable with." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1810, she was {{presented}} to the elected heir to the throne, Charles August, Crown Prince of Sweden. During his visit, he stopped before the portrait of her grandson Gustav, and informed her that he wished to adopt him for his successor. Later that year (2 November 1810), she {{was presented}} to the next elected heir to the throne, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte. He regarded her with suspicion and believed that she did not wish to see him, but she commented: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the sensitivity of the Crown prince, but he is mistaken, if he believe that I do not wish to see him! It would be unfair if I were to hold the least bit dislike toward him, for it is not he who has deposed my son!" [...] At the meeting, her face were to have turned white, but at the end, she {{is said to have been}} delighted by his charm. In 1811, she was one of few in the Swedish Court who were nice to Désirée Clary.|$|E

2500|$|The fan outcry and {{subsequent}} discussions over Lexa's death led several screenwriters and producers {{to sign the}} Lexa Pledge, a pledge promising to treat gay and lesbian characters in future plotlines with consideration to their emotional and cultural impact. Some have argued that this stifles creativity {{and the freedom to}} develop characters and stories, while others have welcomed the debate, even if they have not signed the pledge. Although Rothenberg said he was [...] "very sorry for not recognizing [...] as fully as [...] should have", he would have still killed off Lexa; he would have written {{it in a way that}} does not perpetuate the trope, such as death after sex. He said that while he understands the argument that Lexa should have had a heroic death, having such a powerful character die by a stray bullet was more realistic because it signifies that anyone can be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who wrote the episode, said, [...] "I don't think that the failure here was to discuss , the failure was to recognize the cultural impact it would have outside the show [...] I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the tidal wave that came down on me.
