Experimental data obtained using reverberation room test method were compared with data from numerical simulation. The innovative sound <b>absorption</b> <b>panel</b> was developed and fabricated using treated coir fibre layers as sound absorption materials. The outer layer of the panel was fabricated from natural fibre/polyester composite panel. This innovative acoustic panel was tested at acoustic lab, faculty of engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia using ISO 354 (1985) standard for noise absorption coefficient and ISO 717 - 1 standard for the transmission lost index.

40|$|In recent years, many open-plan {{houses have}} been {{proposed}} not only for comfort reasons, {{but also as a}} place to engage in family life. However, in contrast to the fact that this kind of plan makes it easy for people to interact, the daily life household sounds that occur inside the home may be perceived as noise. It is especially difficult to suppress the propagation of sound and reverberation in staircase and stairwell areas due to the absence of sound-absorbing furniture. In this study, we focused on addressing sound management within the staircase area in open-plan housing where sound absorption is particularly difficult. In order to suppress sound propagation on the upper and lower floors and the reverberation of sound, we placed a thin sound <b>absorption</b> <b>panel</b> on the wall, ceiling, and riser of the staircase. As a result, we were able to confirm that the propagation of sound on upper and lower floors can be suppressed by carrying out the sound absorption treatment on the staircase. Furthermore, we found that in stairway landing areas, the suppression effect of the propagation of sound varies depending on the position of the sound source and the positioning of the sound <b>absorption</b> <b>panel,</b> {{and that there is a}} position for placing the sound <b>absorption</b> <b>panel</b> where the sound-absorbing effect is effective...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{materials}} are {{turning into a}} substantial alternative option for traditional synthetic ones for acoustical treatments. Natural fibres often have great mechanical properties, have no harmful effects on health, and are available in large quantities often as a waste product of other production cycles. However, great demands for composite porous material contribute to the potential application of natural fibre as sound <b>absorption</b> <b>panel.</b> To assist in that effort, the research presented here studies the feasibility of using selected four kinds of natural fibres which are Ijuk, Kenaf, Coconut coir and Palm oil frond fibre blended separately with natural rubber as sound absorptive materials. Therefore, an experimental investigation was performed to evaluate the acoustical performance characterization and physical properties under qualify applied methods to obtain it. The natural fibres were processed {{with a combination of}} natural rubber at 0 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % composition, respectively. The samples were produced based on diameter size required by impedance tube (ASTM E 1050) and the thickness remains at 50 mm. The sound absorption coefficient (a), test results indicated that samples made by 20 % of natural rubber as binder context exhibit optimum acoustical properties compared other mixing percentage. Among the four kinds of natural fibre, Ijuk exposed peak result on the sound absorption coefficient of 0. 96 at low frequency 1000 Hz and 0. 98 at high frequency 3000 Hz. Overall, the samples made by natural fibre with natural rubber combination were giving a better acoustical performance that outcomes more than 0. 6 sound absorption coefficient value after the mid to high range frequencies to and by that it is capable of using in acoustical treatment especially in low frequency. Moreover, the influences of physical elements on acoustical performance are also described in this research study...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{has become}} a serious {{environmental}} problem and there are demands for alternative sustainable materials which capable to reduce the noise level at various frequency ranges. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} research is to study the potential of turning the agricultural waste and waste paper into a sound <b>absorption</b> <b>panel.</b> For the purpose of this study, combination of two materials was under studied; coconut coir fibre from agriculture waste and shredded waste paper from the office. There were two main objective of the research; first is to develop absorption panels from coconut coir powder that available locally with a combination of shredded paper at different percentage of mixture. Second objective is to identify the absorption rate of the panels. The study encompasses the fabrication of the particle board using the coconut husk powder mix with shredded waste paper and using the gypsum powder as the binder for the two materials. Four acoustic panels of size 0. 5 m x 0. 5 m and 0. 012 m thick were fabricated with different mix ratio; 25 % of coconut coir powder mixed with 75 % of shredded waste papers for sample 1, 50 % both of the material for sample 2, 75 % of coconut coir powder mixed with 25 % of shredded waste paper for sample 3, and lastly 100 % of coconut coir powder for sample 4. The absorption coefficient of the panels was tested in a reverberation chamber and in accordance with ISO 354 : 1985 standards. Based on the results, sample 1 gave the highest absorption coefficient compared to sample 2, 3 and 4. It can be concluded that the acoustic panel made from a mixture of 25 % coconut coir powder with 75 % shredded waste paper provided higher absorption coefficient compared to the performance of the other samples. This might be caused {{by the size of the}} coir powder which is very small, creating less void space in between the panel and thus causing it to absorb less sound. Since sound absorption is very much affected by the availability of void space of the panel, further studies on other potential materials from waste should be conducted...|$|E

40|$|This study {{includes}} the first work about the <b>absorption</b> of a <b>panel</b> absorber under {{the effects of}} microperforation, air pumping, and linear and nonlinear vibrations. In practice, thin perforated panel absorber is backed by a flexible wall to enhance the acoustic performance within the room. The panel is easily excited to vibrate nonlinearly and the wall can vibrate linearly. However, the assumptions of linear panel vibration and no wall vibration are adopted in many research works. The development of the absorption formula {{is based on the}} classical approach and the electroacoustic analogy, in which the impedances of microperforation, air pumping, and linear and nonlinear vibrations are in parallel and connected to that of the air cavity in series. Unlike those finite element, numerical integration, and multiscale solution methods and so forth, the analytic formula to calculate the <b>absorption</b> of a <b>panel</b> absorber does not require heavy computation effort and is suitable for engineering calculation purpose.

Recycled material has many advantages as absorbance material compared to the conventional panels because it can reduce product cost, good handling, and environmental protection. This study discusses the viability of recycled papers to be implemented as sound <b>absorption</b> <b>panel.</b> The study was carried out {{on the use of}} by-product from recycle material which has common use in daily life which is paper. The chosen of recycled paper are known for its soft and absorbance properties and easy to be use and reformed. The recycled papers being undergo a shredded process into pieces and also the clumped process. Then, it will be inserted into 100 cm x 100 m square framed panel to be tested. There are three samples were used in this study which is empty panel as the controlled parameter,panel with shredded paper and panel with clumped paper. The reverberant room method use in this research was referred to the standard by ASTM C 423 to obtain the acoustic properties of the samples. For the test, it was carried out at mini sound transmission chamber located at Faculty of Architecture, Planning & Sun/eying in UiTM Shah Alam. From the test, it show sample 3 which is panel with the clumped paper display the most good results compared with other samples. Sample 3 (Clumped Paper) shows the Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC) with the reading 0. 90 a, that is fall in the class ‘A’ which is the value range from 0. 90 to 1. 00 of the sound absorbance rating by Baumann (2001). Furthermore, according to the standard provide by ASTM C 423 & F 2154, the sample 3 (clumped paper) has already achieved the minimum sound absorption coefficient from the ASTM which the minimum requirement for 2 inch (50. 8 mm) panel is 0. 80 a and absorption coefficient for sample 3 is 0. 90.

40|$|Problem statement: An organic {{material}} {{is one of}} the major requirements to improve living environment and the invention of materials need to consider for the best solution. This study presents an experimental investigation on pure porous from Date Palm Fibre (DPF). The effectiveness of sound absorbers depends on structural architecture of this material. This study was conducted to examine the potential of using date palm fibre as sound absorber. The effects of porous layer thicknesses, densities and compression on Acoustic Absorption Coefficient (AAC) of sound absorber using date palm fibre were studied. Approach: Rigid frame Johnson-Allard Model for various sample thicknesses was used in this study. The measurements were conducted in impedance tube on normal incidence acoustic absorption. The date palm fibre was mixed with latex which used for physical treatment on this material. Acoustic absorption behaviour of a porous material with different thicknesses was studied as well as samples with same thickness but different densities. In addition, samples with same properties but different period of compression time were inspected. The tests were in accordance to ISO 10534 - 2 and ASTM E 1050 - 98 international standards for Acoustic Absorption Coefficient (AAC). Results: The experimental data indicates that two peak values of AAC is 0. 93 at 1356 Hz for sample with 50 mm thickness, also the AAC at high frequency for same thickness is 0. 99 at 4200 - 4353 Hz that means able to improve acoustic absorption coefficient at low and high frequencies with significant increasing. Meanwhile, another experimental results were acquired for AAC of date palm fibre, with samples thicknesses of 35 mm at different densities. The results show that denser sample (11 Kg m - 3) has higher AAC value of 0. 83 at 1934 - 2250 Hz as compared to less dense sample (9. 92 Kg m - 3) with AAC value 0. 84 at 2443 - 2587 Hz. Conclusion: Acoustic absorption coefficient AAC of date palm fibre was increased at all frequencies when the thickness of sample was increased, particularly at low frequencies less than 1200 Hz. The introduction of latex on the samples adds stiffness, so that sound can be dissipated significantly as it travels through material. Results from the experimental tests show that date palm fibre has good acoustic properties at low and high frequencies and can be used as an alternative replacement to conventional product. Increasing density of the samples, increase the AAC as well. The innovative acoustic <b>absorption</b> <b>panel</b> has a good potential because they are cheaper and lighter in comparison to asbestos and rock wool industrial materials...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Noise {{control was}} one of the major {{requirements}} to improve the living environment. One of the methods to do that is provided by sound absorber. Commonly, multi-layer sound absorbers are applied to absorb broadband noise that was composed of perforated plates, air space and porous material. However, multi-layers sound absorbers effectiveness depends on their construction. This study was conducted to investigate the potential of using coconut coir fiber as sound absorber. The effects of porous layer backing and perforated plate on sound absorption coefficient of sound absorber using coconut coir fiber were studied. Approach: Car boot liners made from woven cotton cloth were used as type of porous layer in the study. This material has been used widely in automotive industry. Perforated plate used was machined with perforation ratio of 0. 20, thickness of 1 mm and holed diameter of 2 mm. The samples were tested at the acoustic lab of the Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment, University Kebangsaan Malaysia, according to ASTM E 1050 - 98 international standards for noise absorption coefficient. Results: The experiment data indicates that porous layer backing can improve noise absorption coefficient at low and high frequencies with significant increasing. 20 mm thick layer coconut coir fiber with porous layer backing exhibit peak value at frequencies between 2750 - 2825 Hz with maximum value of 0. 97. The experimental results also found that the coconut coir fiber with perforated plate gives higher value for lower frequencies range from 600 - 2400 Hz. The optimum value for coconut coir fiber with perforated panel is around 0. 94 - 0. 95 for the frequency range 2600 - 2700 Hz. Conclusion: Noise absorption coefficient of coconut coir fiber was increased at all frequency when they were backing with Woven Cotton Cloth (WCC). At low frequency, the NAC have significant increasing. This is because WCC have higher flow resistivity than coconut coir fibers, so that sound can be dissipated as it travels through material significantly. The results from the experimental tests show that it has good acoustic properties at low and high frequencies and can used to be an alternative replacement of synthetic based commercial product. By using the porous layer and perforated plate backing to coconut coir fiber, the sound absorber panel shows a good potential to be an environmentally friendly product. This innovative sound <b>absorption</b> <b>panel</b> has a bright future because they are cheaper, lighter and environmentally compare to glass fiber and mineral based synthetic materials...|$|E

But, in order to produce large panels with a semi-continuous process, thermo-mechanical insertion of the foamed nanocomposite with supercritical CO 2 can be more suitable. The characterization of the electromagnetic <b>absorption</b> of the <b>panels</b> produced by different routes shows that the performance is not much sensitive to processing defects making possible upscaling to mass production...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} wood-derived {{charcoal}} flour {{on the water}} resistance and mechanical properties of wood plastic composite (WPC) panels was investigated. The hot press molded WPC panels were produced from polypropylene (37 wt%) with maleic anhydride-grafted polypropylene (MAPP, 3 wt%) and different mixtures of wood flour and charcoal flour. The amount of charcoal flour was gradually increased up to 60 wt%. The thickness swelling and water <b>absorption</b> of WPC <b>panels</b> considerably decreased with increasing charcoal flour content. The internal bond strength and bending properties of the WPC panels significantly improved with increasing charcoal flour content. This was mainly attributed to the high amount of pores and gaps in the charcoal flour. Melted polypropylene could get into the pores and gaps during the hot press molding, which lead to a better interfacial adhesion between polymer matrix and wood filler. The {{results showed that the}} charcoal flour could be partially substituted for the wood flour in the production of WPC panels having higher dimensional stability and internal bond strength...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{experimental}} {{investigations have}} been conducted into the sound transmission loss of double leaf wall systems. From these investigations, {{it has been observed}} that the properties of the wall panels, material placed within the wall cavity as well as the type of wall connections used, greatly influence the sound transmission through the wall system. In all of these cases the wall cavity greatly affects the extent of this influence and in some cases it can even nullify their effect when changes are made. In this paper the influence of the wall cavity based on experimental trends is investigated. The investigation revealed that a wide variety of conclusions were obtained by different researchers concerning the role of the cavity and the properties of any associated sound absorption material on the sound transmission loss through double leaf wall systems. Consequently recommendations {{about the ways in which}} sound transmission through cavity systems can be improved should always be qualified with regard to the specific frequency range of interest, type of sound <b>absorption</b> material, wall <b>panel</b> and stud characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Typically, {{close-fitting}} enclosures {{are installed}} with sound absorption treatments {{to enhance the}} noise reduction performance at acoustic resonant frequencies. Perforated panels require small space to achieve high sound absorption at a particular frequency range when compared with typical foam or porous materials used in a close-fitting enclosure. Moreover, perforated panels may be made of any material, from plastic, plywood to sheet metal and thus are durable under severe conditions without any protection. In this paper, the sound <b>absorption</b> of perforated <b>panels</b> is investigated theoretically and experimentally. The experimental sound absorption coefficients are obtained {{from a series of}} impedance tube tests and compared with the predictions based on Maa [1]. Also, an enclosure mounted with a perforated panel is setup experimentally to explore the noise reduction performance. The general trend of the absorption performance of the perforated panels applied to the enclosure matches to that observed in the impedance tube test. From the experimental results, it can be concluded that perforated panels are effective to absorb the sound energies due to acoustic resonance of close-fitting enclosure but not those due to structural resonance.

40|$|AbstractThis {{project was}} {{conducted}} to produce a cement panel {{with the addition of}} treated and untreated coconut fiber in cement panel. Coconut fiber was added to replace coarse aggregate (sand) in this cement panel. In this project, the ratios used to design the mixture were 1 : 1 : 0, 1 : 0. 97 : 0. 03, 1 : 0. 94 : 0. 06, 1 : 0. 91 : 0. 09 (cement: sand: coconut fiber). The water cement ratio was constant at 0. 55. The sizes of sample tested were, 160 mm x 40 mm x 40 mm for compression test, and 100 mm x 100 mm x 40 mm for density, moisture content and water absorption tests. After curing samples for 28 days, {{it was found that the}} addition of coconut fiber, further increase in compressive strength of cement panel with untreated coconut fiber. Moisture content of cement panel with treated coconut fiber increased with increasing content of coconut fiber whereas water <b>absorption</b> of cement <b>panel</b> with untreated coconut fiber increased with increasing content of coconut fiber. The density of cement panel decreased with the addition of untreated and treated coconut fiber...|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{buildings}} are large energy consumers and opportunities exist {{to improve the}} way they produce and consume electricity, heating and cooling. If energy system integration is feasible, {{this can lead to}} significant reductions in energy consumption and emissions. In this context, this work expands on an existing integrated Technology Selection and Operation (TSO) optimisation model for distributed energy systems (DES). The model considers combined heat and power (CHP) and organic Rankine cycle (ORC) engines, <b>absorption</b> chillers, photovoltaic <b>panels</b> and batteries with the aim of guiding decision makers in making attractive investments that are technically feasible and environmentally sound. A retrofit case study of a UK food distribution centre is presented to showcase the benefits and trade-offs that integrated energy systems present by contrasting outcomes when different technologies are considered. Results show that the preferred investment options select a CHP coupled either to an ORC unit or to an absorption chiller. These solutions provide appealing internal rates of return of 28 – 30 % with paybacks within 3. 5 – 3. 7 years, while also decarbonising the building by 95 – 96 % (if green gas is used to power the site). Overall, the TSO model provides valuable insights allowing stakeholders to make well-informed decisions when evaluating complex integrated energy systems...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} different pressing pressures {{and the influence of}} the wood features on the properties of plywood produced with sapwood and heartwood Hovenia dulcis combined with Pinus elliottii. To support the discussion, the anatomical and physical characterizations of the wood were carried out. The panels were produced by applying three different press pressures (0. 88, 1. 18 and 1. 47 MPa) and with six combinations of wood veneers. Phenol-formaldehyde resin was employed, 160 g m- 2 in a simple line and 35 % solid content. The anatomical analysis revealed that the sapwood is more permeable than the H. dulcis heartwood. The H. dulcis wood basic density it was higher than that of the P. elliottii. Increased press pressure raised the values of the apparent density, thickness swelling and thickness swelling plus recovery of the plywood and water <b>absorption</b> reduction. The <b>panels</b> produced with H. dulcis veneers presented higher apparent density, MOR, MOE and bonding line resistance, as well as lower water absorption and moisture content, than those produced with P. elliottii veneers. No difference was noticed regarding the plywood properties when the main effects were evaluated in relation to the use of H. dulcis heartwood and sapwood veneers...|$|R
