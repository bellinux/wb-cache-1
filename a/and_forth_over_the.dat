25|$|Alternating {{layers of}} shallow marine and non-marine sediments were {{deposited}} as the shoreline fluctuated back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> area. These sediments became the locally 650 to 750foot (200 to 230m) thick Masuk Member. The Masuk consists of cliff-forming cross-bedded sandstones and slope-forming yellowish-gray to bluish-gray mudstones with interbedded light gray sandstones. Fossils of bivalves, ceratopsian dinosaurs, crocodiles, gastropods, and turtles {{have been collected}} in this member.|$|E
25|$|Salvage divers from Halliburton first {{detached}} the bow {{from the}} rest of the vessel because it may have contained unexploded torpedo warheads and because it could break off and destabilise the lifting. The divers installed two large hydraulic suction anchors into the seabed and attached a high-strength tungsten carbide abrasive saw that was pulled back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bow between the anchors. It took ten days to detach the bow.|$|E
50|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{this bird}} {{has been little}} studied. The males (and sometimes the females) perch high in trees by the Sierpe River and fly back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> low <b>over</b> <b>the</b> water. A swooping form of flight has been observed which is possibly a courtship display.|$|R
25|$|Very-high-mass stars {{develop into}} supergiants that follow an {{evolutionary}} track that takes them back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> horizontally <b>over</b> <b>the</b> HR diagram, {{at the right}} end constituting red supergiants. These usually end their life as a type II supernova. The most massive stars can become Wolf–Rayet stars without becoming giants or supergiants at all.|$|R

25|$|Webspinners {{continually}} {{extend their}} galleries into new food sources, and expand their existing galleries {{as they grow}} in size. The insects spin silk by moving their forelegs back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> substrate, and rotating their bodies to create a cylindrical, silk-lined tunnel. Older galleries have multiple laminate layers of silk. Each gallery complex contains a number of individuals, often descended from a single female, and forms a complex maze-like structure, extending from a secure retreat into whatever vegetable food matter is available nearby. The size {{and complexity of the}} colony varies between species, and they can be very extensive in those species that live in hot and humid climates.|$|E
500|$|In 1924 J. Jovanović {{went public}} stating that his warning {{had been made}} on his own initiative, {{and what he said}} was that [...] "Among the Serb youths (in the army) there may be one who will put a ball-cartridge in his rifle or {{revolver}} in place of a blank cartridge and he may fire it, the bullet might strike the man giving provocation (Franz Ferdinand)." [...] J. Jovanović's account changed back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years and never adequately addressed Colonel Lesanin's statement. [...] Bilinski did not speak openly on the subject, but his press department chief confirmed that a meeting had taken place including a vague warning, but {{there was no mention of}} an ethnic Serb Austro-Hungarian soldier shooting Franz Ferdinand.|$|E
500|$|To {{show the}} side effects Focusyn had on Bart, the animators made slight changes to his face as the episode progressed. It is first seen in the scene where Bart is reading [...] "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Pre-teens": a cheek line is added just under his eyes {{to suggest that he}} is {{starting}} to change. In another scene, Bart can be seen speed reading and later on, the animators drew him with [...] "mini-pupils". The staff discussed whether Bart's pupils would be bigger or smaller than normal while he is on the drug. The writers settled on smaller pupils and, according to Kirkland, [...] "several model sheets were going back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fax machines" [...] until the staff were satisfied with the size of Bart's pupils while influenced by the drug. In fact, psychostimulants used to treat ADHD are more likely cause pupils to become bigger (dilated).|$|E

60|$|They {{waited for}} {{evening at the}} farmhouse. A little before sunset the ship was {{signaled}} as in sight; and then Pere Bonan and his wife, followed by Gabriel <b>and</b> Perrine, set <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> heath to the beach. With the solitary exception of Francois Sarzeau, the whole population of the neighborhood was already assembled there, Gabriel's brother and sisters being among the number.|$|R
2500|$|Bread making {{began with}} the milling of the grain. It was a {{difficult}} and time-consuming task, performed by women. Each household stored its own grain, and {{it is estimated that}} it required at least three hours of daily effort to produce enough flour to make sufficient bread for a family of five. The earliest milling was performed with a pestle and mortar, or a stone quern consisting of a large lower stone that held the grain and a smooth upper stone that was moved back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> grains (...) [...] This often left small pieces of grit in the flour. The use of the millstone became more widespread during the Iron Age, resulting in greater speed and increased production of flour. Smaller versions for household use, the rotary or beehive quern, appeared during the early Persian period.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2008, on DJ Cisco's Urban Legend mixtape, Ice-T criticized DeAndre Cortez [...] "Soulja Boy Tell 'Em" [...] Way for [...] "killing hip hop" [...] and {{his song}} [...] "Crank That" [...] for being [...] "garbage" [...] {{compared}} to the works of other hip-hop artists such as Rakim, Das EFX, Big Daddy Kane and Ice Cube. One of the comments in the exchange was when Ice-T told Way to [...] "eat a dick". The two then traded numerous videos back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Internet. These videos included a cartoon and video of Ice-T dancing on Way's behalf and an apology, but reiteration of his feelings that Way's music [...] "sucks", on Ice-T's behalf. Rapper Kanye West defended Way saying [...] "He came from the 'hood, made his own beats, made up a new saying, new sound and a new dance with one song." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the final}} video {{interlude}} [...] "Illuminati", {{seven of the}} dancers climbed twenty foot poles and began swaying back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> audience seated on the floor. The singer returned to the stage in a 1920s flapper-inspired dress to perform a mashup of [...] "Music" [...] and [...] "Candy Shop". A slowed down version of [...] "Material Girl" [...] found Madonna pushing her tuxedo clad dancers down an incline and played the ukulele once again during a cover of [...] "La Vie en rose" [...] alone on stage. On selected shows, Madonna also performed a snippet of [...] "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend". During [...] "Unapologetic Bitch", Madonna invited someone from the audience, terming {{the person with the}} titular name, and gifting a banana. The show ended with [...] "Holiday", where Madonna came out wrapped in the flag of the country she performed in, while energetically dancing around the stage as confetti dropped from the ceiling. At the end of the performance, she was strapped into a harness and flew above the stage, before disappearing behind the video screens.|$|E
60|$|This {{is all of}} it! No more, no less. Not a word to {{indicate}} whether I regretted the decision or welcomed it, and from subsequent equally bald notes, I derive the information that my father retained his position as grain buyer, and that he drove back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> daily <b>over</b> <b>the</b> five miles which lay between the farm and the elevator. There {{is no mention of}} my mother, no hint as to how she felt, although the return to the loneliness and drudgery of the farm must have been as grievous to her as to her sons.|$|R
50|$|Although Chaos Strikes Back {{describes}} {{itself as}} an expansion pack, the original Dungeon Master is not required. Whereas the first game saw the player following a fairly linear path through the adventure, with the completion of each flat level marked by a staircase leading down onto a new slightly harder level below, Chaos Strikes Back features a choice of paths which twist back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> all levels. <b>The</b> puzzles are far more convoluted, often demanding quick mastery of the control system to deal with intense combat, along with brain vexing riddles and room layouts.|$|R
40|$|When a elastic body {{is moved}} quasistatically back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> a surface, <b>the</b> {{friction}} of the interface is experimentally observed to circulate through a hysteretic loop. The asymptotic behaviour of the hysteresis loop is approached exponentially.

2500|$|Throughout the afternoon, Confederate {{engineers}} {{scrambled to}} create a new defensive line 500 yards further south {{at the base of the}} Mule Shoe, while fighting at the Bloody Angle continued day and night with neither side achieving an advantage, until around 12:00 AM on May 13, the fighting finally stopped. At 4 A.M., the exhausted Confederate infantrymen were notified that the new line was ready and they withdrew from the original earthworks unit by unit. The combat they had endured for almost 24 hours was characterized by an intensity of firepower never previously seen in Civil War battles, as the entire landscape was flattened, all the foliage destroyed. An example of this can be found in the Smithsonian Museum of American History: a 22-inch stump of an oak tree at the Bloody Angle that was completely severed by rifle fire. There was a frenzy to the carnage on both sides. Fighting back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> same corpse-strewn trenches for hours on end, using single shot muskets, the contending troops were periodically reduced to hand-to-hand combat reminiscent of battles fought during ancient times. Bodies piled up four and five high, and soldiers were forced to pause from time to time and throw corpses over the parapet since they formed an obstacle in the way of the fighting. Dead and wounded men were shot so many times that many of them simply fell apart into unrecognizable heaps of flesh. Surviving participants attempted to describe in letters, diaries, and memoirs the hellish intensity of that day, many noting that it was beyond words. Or, as one put it: [...] "Nothing can describe the confusion, the savage, blood-curdling yells, the murderous faces, the awful curses, and the grisly horror of the melee." [...] Some men claimed to have fired as many as 400 rounds that day. May 12 was the most intensive day of fighting during the battle, with Union casualties of about 9,000, Confederate 8,000; the Confederate loss includes about 3,000 prisoners captured in the Mule Shoe.|$|E

60|$|It {{was a very}} calm, sunny {{morning when}} we {{launched}} <b>forth</b> <b>and</b> rowed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> lagoon towards the outlet in the reef, and passed between the two green islets that guarded the entrance. We experienced some difficulty and no little danger in passing the surf of the breaker, and shipped {{a good deal of}} water in the attempt; but once past the billow, we found ourselves floating placidly on the long, oily swell that rose and fell slowly as it rolled <b>over</b> <b>the</b> wide ocean.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} instruments for applying nonspecific pressure by rubbing, rolling, or applying {{pressure on the}} reflex zones of the body. The acuball is a small ball made of rubber with protuberances that is heatable. It is used to apply pressure and relieve muscle and joint pain. The energy roller is a small cylinder with protuberances. It is held between the hands and rolled back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> to apply acupressure. The foot roller (also [...] "krupa chakra") is a round, cylindrical roller with protuberances. It {{is placed on the}} floor and the foot is rolled back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> it. <b>The</b> power mat (also pyramid mat) is a mat with small pyramid-shaped bumps that you walk on. The spine roller is a bumpy roller containing magnets that is rolled up and down the spine. The Teishein is one of the original nine classical acupuncture needles described in the original texts of acupuncture. Even though it is described as an acupuncture needle it did not pierce the skin. It is used to apply rapid percussion pressure to the points being treated.|$|R
40|$|Modular {{self-reconfigurable}} robots present {{wide and}} unique solutions for growing demands in {{the domains of}} space exploration, automation, consumer products, <b>and</b> so <b>forth.</b> The higher utilization factor and self-healing capabilities are most demanded traits in robotics for real world applications and modular robotics offer better solutions in these perspectives in relation to traditional robotics. The researchers in robotics domain identified various applications and prototyped numerous robotic models while addressing constraints such as homogeneity, reconfigurability, form factor, and power consumption. The diversified nature of various modular robotic solutions proposed for real world applications and utilization of different sensor and actuator interfacing techniques along with physical model optimizations presents implicit challenges to researchers while identifying and visualizing the merits/demerits of various approaches to a solution. This paper attempts to simplify the comparison of various hardware prototypes by providing a brief study on hardware architectures of modular robots capable of self-healing and reconfiguration along with design techniques adopted in modeling robots, interfacing technologies, <b>and</b> so <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> past 25 years...|$|R

60|$|Hereupon, Periwinkle, Clover, Sweet Fern, and as {{many others}} of the little {{fraternity}} and cousinhood as were still at Tanglewood, gathered about Eustace, and earnestly besought him for a story.

60|$|It was Dave {{who found}} himself the first attacked. A tall Iroquois, {{straight}} as an arrow, leaped upon him {{and tried to}} stab him with a hunting knife. The young soldier warded off the blow, with his gun, and in a trice the pair were locked in each other's arms and swaying back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> rocks. The Indian muttered something between his set teeth, but Dave did not understand what was said.|$|E
50|$|Her return {{coincided with}} the seventh of Japan's 10 kikusui attacks on Okinawa shipping. The onslaught had begun the {{previous}} evening but had subsided somewhat during the daylight hours of the 24th when Ammen resumed duty as a fighter director. Just before 2000, the Japanese renewed their attacks with increasing intensity. The first six raids she detected posed no real threat to Ammen and her colleagues at radar picket station 15. The seventh raid closed to within five miles of her station but kept its distance in face of antiaircraft fire from Ammens consorts. From that time until about 0300 on the 25th, aircraft flew back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> station 15. <b>The</b> warships assigned there let fly with their antiaircraft batteries whenever enemy planes approached.|$|R
5000|$|After {{returning}} to the United States in August 1944, he was named commander of the 314th Bomb Wing (Very Heavy) and promoted to brigadier general in January 1945. Power moved his B-29s to Guam in December 1944 {{as part of the}} 21st Bomber Command. From Guam, he directed the first large-scale fire bomb raid on Tokyo, Japan, on March 9, 1945. In a command aircraft, flying back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> Tokyo during <b>the</b> attack, Power was deeply impressed by the inferno of destruction playing out thousands of feet below.

5000|$|The {{view that}} oysters are {{acceptable}} to eat, even by strict ethical criteria, has notably been propounded in the seminal 1975 text Animal Liberation, by philosopher Peter Singer. However, subsequent editions have reversed this position (advocating against eating oysters). Singer {{has stated that}} he has [...] "gone back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> on this <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years", and as of 2010 states that [...] "while you could give them {{the benefit of the}} doubt, you could also say that unless some new evidence of a capacity for pain emerges, the doubt is so slight that there is no good reason for avoiding eating sustainably produced oysters".|$|R
60|$|Back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Green Meadows sailed Whitetail the Marsh Hawk. Like Longlegs the Blue Heron, he was hungry. His sharp eyes {{peered down}} among the grasses, looking for {{something}} to eat, but some good fairy seemed to have warned the very little people who live there that Whitetail was out hunting. Perhaps it was one of Old Mother West Wind's children, the Merry Little Breezes. You know they are always flitting about trying to do some one a good turn.|$|E
60|$|Then Johnny Chuck {{took them}} over {{to the edge of the}} old orchard, where they could peep out over the Green Meadows. He pointed out old Whitetail the Marshhawk, sailing back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> meadows, and told them how once, when he was a little Chuck and had run away from home, old Whitetail had nearly caught him.

60|$|After an {{interval}} his mood changed. He {{rose to his}} feet, his trembling limbs strengthened with a youthful vigour as he ascended the temple steps and gained its doorway. He turned for a moment, <b>and</b> looked <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> street, ere he entered the hallowed domain of his distempered imagination. To him the cloudy sky above was now shining with the radiance of the sun-bright East. The death-laden highways of Rome, as they stretched before him, were beautiful with lofty trees, and populous with happy figures; and along the dark flagstones beneath, where still lay the corpses which he had no eye to see, he beheld already the priests of Serapis with his revered guardian, his beloved Macrinus of former days, at their head, advancing to meet and welcome him {{in the hall of}} the Egyptian god. Visions such as these passed gloriously before the Pagan's eyes as he stood triumphant {{on the steps of the}} temple, and brightened to him with a noonday light its dusky recesses when, after his brief delay, he turned from the street and disappeared through the doorway of the sacred place.|$|R
25|$|To the north, Kienmayer flushed French {{outposts}} from Isen. These {{executed a}} planned withdrawal westward to Grenier's main line of defense. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Prince Karl of Schwarzenberg, who led Kienmayer's left division, pushed southwest {{to crash into}} the divisions of Bastoul and Ney. An Austrian force captured the town of Forstern, but Moreau committed d'Hautpoul's reserve cavalry to help drive them out. A back <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> struggle began <b>over</b> <b>the</b> hamlets of Tading, Wetting, Kreiling, and Kronacker, which run in a north to south line. The Austrian Murray Infantry Regiment Nr. 55 distinguished itself in the fighting for Kronacker, which lies only 1.3km north of Hohenlinden.

5000|$|Medical, or clinical, praxiology {{is an old}} term {{introduced}} by Sadegh-Zadeh in 1977-1981 already to denote a wide-ranging inquiry into the foundations of clinical practice, particularly of clinical judgment and decision-making, {{with the aim of}} reducing diagnostic-therapeutic errors and of improving physician performance. In the latter article referred to, he has defined the term explicitly as [...] "analysis of clinical practice", [...] "inquiry into clinical practice", and [...] "theory of clinical practice", i.e., the philosophy, methodology, and logic of medical doing and acting. Central topics include everything related to concepts and theories that are basic to clinical practice, i.e., the concepts and theories of patient, suffering, health, illness, disease, diagnosis, etiology, prognosis, therapy, and prevention. This perspective, Sadegh-Zadeh claims, creates a fertile scientific field with a host of tasks ranging from conceptual analyses (like [...] "what is disease?", [...] "what is a diagnosis?", [...] "what is differential diagnosis?", etc.) to logical analyses - such as [...] "is clinical decision-making computable or does it require human intelligence and intuition?"
