While becoming a potential market for agri-food exporters, China has also grown into a major competitor in international agri-food markets, particularly in Asia.

We begin by presenting various estimates of the volume of rice imports, including estimates derived from data on rice-exporting countries, which show that official figures for imports have substantially understated <b>actual</b> <b>imports.</b> Next, we discuss the price incentives for imports, as determined by exchange-rate and rice trade policy (import tariffs and periodic import bans).

40|$|AbstractSince the 21 st century, the {{reserves}} of {{conventional natural gas}} as well as tight gas in China have been decreasing and their annual production growth rates have been generally reduced from double-digit to one-digit number of percentage. It is predicted that natural gas production will possibly reach up to 134 billion m 3 in 2015; and if the marketable rate is 90 %, the gas supply volume will probably be 120. 6 billion m 3 in 2015. Since shale gas development just has started currently, about 0. 6 billion m 3 of the marketable shale gas {{will be added to}} gas supply in 2015. The CBM gas production especially such gas consumption has long been lagged behind the expected targets, and what's more, flaws exist in their statistics; on this basis, it is assumed that the marketable CBM gas will be 4 billion Nm 3 in 2015. With so many achievements made in the coal gas exploitation, it is forecasted that about 5. 5 billion m 3 coal gas will be added to gas supply in 2015. In total, the domestic fuel gas supply is roughly estimated to be 131 billion m 3 in 2015; if the gas consumption in the year is presumably 231 billion m 3, about 100 billion m 3 gas will then be imported in 2015. From the presumable <b>actual</b> <b>imports</b> of piped gas and LNG terminals, there is still a gap of 27 – 30 billion m 3 in 2015. Therefore, it is suggested that more LNG receiving terminals be put into production in advance and the increment of import gas be needed from Middle Asia. Also, it is proposed that the statistics be completed on the practical marketable fuel gas quantity in the fundamental study of energy planning in the National 13 th Five-Year Plan.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collection}} of three essays on international trade and economic growth. Chapter 1 analyzes the dynamic gains from trade in a Hecksher-Ohlin economy with endogenous factor accumulation. In a framework where heterogeneous workers make educational decisions in the presence of complete markets, I first show how convergence of factor rewards induces divergence of factor abundance and levels of income. When heterogeneous workers invest in schooling, higher type agents earn a surplus from their investment. By affecting educational decisions, trade influences the international distribution of this surplus. The latter effect tends to benefit richer countries disproportionately, leading to divergence of welfare when markets are opened to trade. The shift of investments to initially rich countries also leads to a global increase of the average skill premium despite a decrease of the price of skill intensive goods. I next examine whether the factor content of trade indeed does affect domestic education decisions. To establish a causal relation, I instrument for the factors embodied in <b>actual</b> <b>imports</b> by the geographic component of trade. The constructed measures of geographical proximity to skilled and unskilled labor have significant effects on domestic educational decisions. (cont.) Countries that tend to be close to international supply of skilled labor have lower levels of advanced education, while the reverse is true for countries that are close to labor abundant nations. A one standard deviation difference in geographic proximity to skilled labor is associated with a difference' of about 2 / 3 of a year of average higher education. Chapter 2 examines why movements of relative costs brought about by exchange rate fluctuations are passed on to customers only slowly, and never to a full extent. We first develop a perfectly competitive economy featuring heterogeneity of both good qualities and of consumer valuations. In equilibrium, high valuation consumers and high quality firms are matched. The relative scarcity of different qualities leads to pricing-to-market and markups that are determined by the local toughness of competition. Our production setup features trade in intermediate goods, local assembly that is subject to decreasing returns and fixed costs of market entry. In every export market, firm entry and size decisions are determined by how local prices compare to the cost of production at home. We next analyze how changes in the real exchange rate are transmitted internationally. (cont.) In the short run, the set of firms active in the export sector is fixed, but each firm accommodates changes in the exchange rate by adjusting the quantity of its exports. Due to this response of export volume to the relative cost of production, market toughness counteracts exchange rate movements, leading to partial pass-through in the short run. Due to the presence of fixed costs of market access, in the long run also the set of firms that are actively exporting reacts to movements of the real exchange rate, with two associated consequences. Firstly, pass-through is larger than in the short run because long run export volume responds to relative costs due to changes in both the average firm size and in the number of firms. Secondly, the response of the market entry decision to changes in the relative cost of production affects only low quality firms, which fetch a relatively low price for their output. Exchange rate movements thus change the composition of actively exporting firms, with the consequence that aggregate price indexes overstate the actual extent of pass-through in the long run. Chapter 3 further examines the seminal work of Acemoglu et al. (2001) on the effects of settler mortality on colonization policies during early imperialism. (cont.) The authors build a strong case for the importance of institutions as the primary force of economic development. However, because their empirical analysis is limited to former colonies, they cannot directly distinguish their theory from the rivaling view that a country's disease environment has direct effects on economic prosperity and institutions. In this paper, using either additional historical sources or a model of the geographic determinants of disease, I first construct two measures of mortality rates including up to 36 countries that have not been colonized. I then show that mortality did affect institutional development in former colonies but not {{in the rest of the}} sample. This can only be rationalized in the context of the colonial origins theory of Acemoglu et al. Turning to disentanlge the relation between institutions and income, I sometimes find that disease environment influences income also directly and correspondingly, that institutions are somewhat less important for prosperity in my specifications than when working with a sample composed of only former colonies. Incorporating these findings, I estimate that institutions are the major determinant of long run prosperity and can explain about 50 % of the observed variation of current income levels, while the direct effects of disease environment can account for about 15 %. by Raphael Anton Maximilian Peter Gabriel Auer.

Results were obtained by comparing immunofluorescence localizations of wild-type and C-terminal-truncated proteins transiently expressed from cDNAs introduced by microprojectile bombardment.

40|$|Host {{studies of}} {{protection}} {{in developing countries}} are concerned with questions of static losses of real output or inefficient resource allocation at some point of time. These studies are often criticised as not relevant to problems of development. This paper incorporates the effects of protection into {{the most widely used}} macro—economic projection model, the 'two—gap' model of Chenory and Strout, and examines some dynamic implications of protection. The adaptation of the two-gap model explicitly allows for two facts related to protection: 1) The apparent amount of import substitution or foreign exchange saving, overstates the <b>actual,</b> <b>import</b> saving if the new industry is protected. 2) The apparent amount of export growth or new foreign exchango earned, is understated whenever protection applies only to import substitutes. Thus, the presence of protection will cause the usual macroeconomic projection models to understate import demand whenever conventional definitions of value added are used, if there is emphasis on import substitution behind protection in the plan period. The adaptation to the model makes it qui+e clear why oountries pursuing industrialization by means of protection often run into balance of payments difficulties; The factor payments generated in import—substituting industries cxceed the value of foreign exchange saved in the industry - sometimes by substantial amounts. For countries like Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania with a high marginal propensity to import, and for industries &s highly protected as come of the largo establishments in East Africa, it is quite possible for an investment in import substitution to produce a deterioration, rather than an improvement, in the balance of payments. The paper also explores the implications of protection for the "requirements" of foreign assistance to sustain a given development programs The results show that, because protection to industries in fact results in less balance of payments improvement than it appears to, the need for foreign assistance will be greater (i. e. the balance of payments constraint is more severe) the greater is the reliance on protection to "encourage" growth...|$|R

The Languedoc-Roussillon region of France, which Gard belongs to, {{does not have a}} high level of local seismicity, though it can affected by large earthquakes originating in the Pyrenees and in Provence. The new seismic zoning of France, issued on 1 May 2011, grades the seismicity of the Gard department as moderate to weak (Plan Séisme 2011). The extant SisFrance (2010) Gard earthquake catalog starts with a shock felt in Uzès in 1186 (intensity and epicentral location unknown), includes only one slightly damaging local earthquake (1946, epicentral intensity 6 – 7 on the MSK- 1964 scale), and associates the maximum macroseismic intensity on record in the area with an extra-regional event, the 1909 Lambesc (Provence) earthquake, the strongest event located in metropolitan (i. e., mainland) France during the last century (epicentral intensity 8 – 9 on the MSK- 1964 scale). But this picture could be incomplete. A recent study of the Uzès-Nîmes Roman aqueduct, Volant et al.
