500|$|John Watkins, {{chairman}} of the investigation panel, told the inquiry the evidence supporting the theory that inadvertent engagement of the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot</b> caused the accident was that its control box was recovered from the wreckage and its gyroscope was still caged. The speed valve unit was also recovered and it indicated the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot</b> was operating {{at the time of}} impact. [...] Inadvertent engagement of the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot</b> with the gyroscope caged could explain a sudden descent by a DC-3. Watkins also said the panel's report to the Director-General made several recommendations and they were already being actioned. [...] These included one recommendation that operation of the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot</b> on-off control on Australian-registered DC-3 aircraft should be made distinctive from operation of any other control in the cockpit.|$|E

500|$|The panel used a DC-3 {{aircraft}} with a cockpit {{identical to}} that of VH-AET to carry out four flight tests with the gyroscope caged. [...] When the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot</b> was engaged the control wheel moved forward so strongly it was torn from the pilot's hands, and regaining control required use of both hands and significant force. [...] Initial tests showed that when the pilot was unprepared, up to 600ft (183m) could be lost before he identified the problem and disengaged the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot.</b> [...] On the fourth test the pilot restricted the height loss to 300ft (91m). The panel considered the most likely explanation of the accident was inadvertent engagement of the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot</b> with the gyroscope caged.|$|E

500|$|An {{investigation}} {{panel was}} promptly established {{to investigate the}} accident. [...] The panel was unable to conclusively establish the cause but it decided the most likely cause was that the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot</b> was inadvertently engaged shortly after takeoff while the gyroscope was caged. [...] The Department of Civil Aviation took action to ensure that operation of the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot</b> on-off control on Douglas DC-3 aircraft was made distinctive from operation of any other control in the cockpit, and that instructions were issued impressing on pilots that gyroscopes should be un-caged prior to takeoff.|$|E

500|$|The {{control box}} for the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot</b> was {{recovered}} from the wreckage. [...] The control knob for its gyroscope was in the caged position and the CAGED warning flag was in view even though the control box carried a placard stating the gyro must be uncaged before takeoff. [...] The automatic pilot's speed valve unit was also recovered; it showed that the three valves were open in positions indicating the unit was operating {{at the time of}} the crash. [...] The investigation panel proposed that the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot</b> might have been engaged at a height of about 400ft (120m) causing the aircraft to descend swiftly into the sea. Engagement could have occurred inadvertently when one of the pilots intended to select fuel cross-feed ON. The operating levers for fuel cross-feed and <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot</b> were the same shape, the same height above the cockpit floor, and about 12 inches (305mm) apart on the cockpit control console.|$|E

On March 1, 1962, the plane [...] having just taken off two minutes earlier [...] {{rolled over and}} crashed into a swamp, killing all 87 passengers and eight crew members aboard. A Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) investigation determined that a manufacturing defect in the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot</b> system led to an uncommanded rudder control system input, causing the accident.

Doolittle approved the plan for Operation Aphrodite on June 26, and assigned the 3rd Bombardment Division with preparing and flying the drone aircraft, which was to be designated BQ-7. In the U.S. Navy's similar project, Operation Anvil, the drone was designated BQ-8.|$|R
500|$|No-one on {{the ground}} at Cambridge aerodrome saw the pilot who {{occupied}} the co-pilot seat prior to takeoff. [...] The panel proposed that the captain may have asked the supernumerary pilot to occupy the co-pilot seat during the flight to Essendon Airport. [...] The supernumerary pilot was on his third flight with the company and had no prior experience flying the C-47 or DC-3. [...] The panel considered that if the supernumerary pilot had occupied the co-pilot seat, and if the captain had called for fuel cross-feed to be turned ON to deal with a fuel pressure problem in one engine, it was possible the supernumerary pilot's lack of familiarity with the DC-3 cockpit caused him to inadvertently engage the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Fueling and Charging: [...] Via {{the tank}} filler cap, 1,133lbs (140 gallons) of petrol (...) were added (later longer-range models held more). [...] The twin spherical iron air bottles {{were charged with}} 900 psi air to power the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot</b> (Steuergerät). [...] Air at 90 psi powered the {{pneumatic}} servo-motors for the elevators and rudder.|$|E
2500|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{immediately}} {{appointed a}} panel of two to investigate the accident. Examination of the wreckage showed that the flaps and undercarriage were retracted and both engines had been producing high power {{at the time of}} the crash. [...] All trim tabs were in typical positions for takeoff and all control cable runs were intact. [...] Nothing was found in the wreckage to indicate any prior defect or failure that might have caused the aircraft to crash or the pilot to lose control. [...] The setting of the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot</b> could not be determined due to destruction of the forward fuselage. The investigation initially focussed on possible failure to remove one of the flight control chocks, defective flight instruments, misuse of the wing flaps, structural failure of the tailplane, defective elevator control system, misuse of the <b>automatic</b> <b>pilot,</b> and incorrect loading.|$|E

Metal, instead of wooden, airscrews were fitted to the aircraft during the flight. [...] Specially designed collapsible rubber dinghies were also carried.
