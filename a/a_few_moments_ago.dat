2500|$|Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) — British philosopher. In a footnote, {{the story}} refers (accurately) to his {{conjecture}} that (in Borges's words) [...] "our planet was created <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> and {{provided with a}} humanity which 'remembers' an illusory past." ...|$|E
60|$|Letitia, who to David's keen {{observation}} seemed {{already to}} have lost something of that strange new quality which she had shown to him only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> shook her head.|$|E
60|$|But I {{could not}} make the other man see it. I felt that some service was due from me to Justice, in {{compensation}} of the wrong I had done her <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> and I argued most eloquently.|$|E
60|$|Arnold obeyed him and {{returned}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> later with <b>a</b> paper in his hand. Mr. Weatherley {{spread out the}} damp sheet under the electric light. He studied it for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> intently, and then folded it up.|$|R
60|$|Philip meditated <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments,</b> then {{produced}} another sentence.|$|R
60|$|He paused <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> nervously. 'Mrs. Petherwin,' he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I put {{you up to}} nothing. I didn't {{even put}} you up to the chance that, as I said <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> I saw for you in {{forwarding}} that thing. Your liberty is therefore in every way complete." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon an {{inquisitive}} compatriot, madam," [...] I said; [...] "but I {{heard you}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> address {{this young lady}} {{by the name of}} a very dear young friend, whom I knew twenty years ago--Sarah Walker. Am I right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} been inexcusable if I had {{forgotten}} you," [...] he answered with a smile. [...] "Still, I couldn't quite place you until <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> when you faced the light. But you were wrong in one thing; I'm no longer Lieutenant Blake." ...|$|E
60|$|For <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> the {{passengers}} maintained a dismal silence.|$|R
60|$|Knight's {{agitation}} and astonishment mastered him for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b>|$|R
60|$|The doctor arrived. His {{examination}} {{was over}} in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Grant quickly {{recovered}} himself. [...] "I am afraid," [...] he said, coming forward, [...] "unless Miss Harcourt does, that I am a mere trespasser in your house, Senora. I saw her pass in your carriage <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> {{and having}} a message for her I ventured to follow her here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{came out}} of Master Lillie's <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> and would have torn down the pole but for the crowd which {{threatened}} him. There he is now, and while you are watching your precious uncle, I'll continue to demand my money from that red-coated lieutenant, if it so pleases me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, but {{you talk}} of a painful {{difference}} of opinion with your husband, and then, when I ask {{for information on the}} point, you bring out a valise. And only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> you reproached me for not being serious. I wonder who is the serious person of us two now." ...|$|E
60|$|After waiting <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> for silence, Mowbray {{turned to}} Devine.|$|R
60|$|Angut {{looked at}} his {{questioner}} very earnestly for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b>|$|R
60|$|Constance cast {{down her}} eyes and {{reflected}} for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Ralph {{leaned over}} his father's pillows and gently {{smoothed}} them; {{he was aware}} their talk had been unduly prolonged. [...] "I shall get just the good I said <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> I wished to put into Isabel's reach--that of having met the requirements of my imagination. But it's scandalous, the way I've taken advantage of you!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{drew back}} now, her cheeks white {{as those of}} the dead. With a wild terror in her eyes she turned to Charlot, who stood the very picture of anguish and {{impotent}} rage. In the cortege, where but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> all had been laughter, a sob or two sounded now from some of the women.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked away}} from him and shuddered. This passionate {{absorption}} of all his energies into one channel had made a fiend of the man. Her slowly growing purpose took to itself root and branch, as she knelt {{by the side of the}} young Englishman, who only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago</b> had seemed the very embodiment of all manly vigour.|$|E
60|$|Cytherea {{was ready}} in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments,</b> {{and entered the}} carriage.|$|R
60|$|Dick pondered for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments,</b> {{and then}} looked up resolutely.|$|R
60|$|The seaman looked thoughtfully at the lamp-smoke for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} passed your friends, nor have I been near them," [...] said Low, {{looking at him}} for the first time, with the same {{exasperating}} calm, [...] "or perhaps I should not be here or they there. I knew that one man entered the wood <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> and that two men and four horses remained outside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Miss Sharey," [...] he said softly, [...] "I {{am going}} to take a holiday. Business is one thing and {{pleasure}} is another. For this evening I {{am going to}} put business out of my mind. The sentiment at which I hinted <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> has, I can assure you, a very real existence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it; {{but look}} here," [...] and Dan held up a straw hat. [...] "That's poor Sam's! His boat has been found bottom up, an' this, {{with one of the}} oars, was fished out of the creek <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago.</b> While we were talking rough about him the poor boy was drowning!" ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was silence}} for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments,</b> and then Aynsley smiled.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> Then Bagshaw spoke again.|$|R

6000|$|Chivers {{blew the}} smoke of his cigar lazily in the still air. [...] "Listen," [...] he said. [...] "Since your miraculous {{conversion}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> I have made some friendly inquiries about you, and I find that you lost all trace of your wife in Texas in '52, where a number of her fellow emigrants died of yellow fever. Is that so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Until <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago,</b> {{the report}} was that you had been {{captured}} in the first rush of the rear-guard which we were rolling up for your attack, and when you were picked up, just now, in plain clothes on the slope, you were not recognized. The one thing seemed to be as improbable as the other," [...] he added significantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard the}} whole story, my boy, and have already talked with Mr. Hargreaves, whom I met <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>ago.</b> I {{do not think}} he can do {{anything}} to you, because you have made many friends here. The money I will take, as it is not well to keep it where it might be stolen; but can give you no receipt until I get home." ...|$|E
60|$|After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> {{he stopped}} awkwardly, and Adam raised his hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> {{later she}} sat up. She was evidently {{becoming}} stronger.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> passed, {{and then}} the old gentleman began to fidget.|$|R
