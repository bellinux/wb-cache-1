A section to create an offence of [...] "gross indecency" [...] between females was added to {{a bill in the}} United Kingdom House of Commons and passed there in 1921, but was rejected in the House of Lords, apparently because they were concerned any attention paid to sexual misconduct would also promote it.|$|E
500|$|There {{are also}} {{structural}} factors {{outside of the}} individual that explain the persistence of modern day slavery in Haiti. The US state department's Trafficking in Persons report has identified the following eight structural {{factors that contribute to}} human trafficking in Latin America and the Caribbean: (1) the high demand for domestic servants, agricultural laborers, sex workers, and factory labor; (2) political, social, or economic crises, as well as natural disasters such as the January 2010 earthquake; (3) lingering machismo (chauvinistic <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices)</b> that tends to lead to discrimination against women and girls; (4) existence of established trafficking networks with sophisticated recruitment methods; (5) public corruption, especially complicity between law enforcement and border agents with traffickers and smugglers of people; (6) restrictive immigration policies in some destination countries that have limited the opportunities for legal migration flows to occur; (7) government disinterest in the issue of human trafficking; and (8) limited economic opportunities for women. [...] The restavek tradition is perpetuated by widespread tolerance for the practice throughout Haiti. [...] Other contributing factors to the restavek system include poverty and lack of access to contraception, education, and employment in the countryside. Poor rural families with many children have few opportunities to feed and educate them, leaving few options other than servitude in the city.|$|E
500|$|In {{an outpouring}} of mid-century revisionist views, {{scholars}} approached Austen more sceptically. D. W. Harding, following and expanding upon Farrer, argued in his essay [...] "Regulated Hatred: An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen" [...] that Austen's novels {{did not support the}} status quo but rather subverted it. [...] Her irony was not humorous but caustic and intended to undermine the assumptions of the society she portrayed. Through her use of irony, Austen attempted to protect her integrity as an artist and a person in the face of <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> she rejected. In his 1940 essay, Harding argued that Austen had to be rescued from the Janites, charging [...] "her books are, as she meant them to be, read and enjoyed by precisely the sort of people she disliked...". Harding argued the Janites regarded Regency England as [...] "expressing the gentler virtue of a civilised social order" [...] that was an escape from the waking nightmare of a world at war, but he argued that its own sort of way that the world of Austen's novels was nightmarish, where the government maintained a system of spies to crush any sympathy with the French Revolution, where friends take delight in causing others pain, where the polite language is usually a facade, and where intelligence in single woman is seen as a problem. Harding maintained that the problem with the Janites was that they could not grasp these aspects of Austen's works. Almost simultaneously, influential critic Q. D. Leavis argued in [...] "Critical Theory of Jane Austen's Writing", published in Scrutiny in the early 1940s, that Austen was a professional, not an amateur, writer. Harding's and Leavis's articles were followed by another revisionist treatment by Marvin Mudrick in Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery (1952). Mudrick portrayed Austen as isolated, defensive, and critical of her society, and described in detail the relationship he saw between Austen's attitude toward contemporary literature and her use of irony as a technique to contrast the realities of her society with what she felt they should be. These revisionist views, together with prominent critic F. R. Leavis's pronouncement in The Great Tradition (1948) that Austen {{was one of the great}} writers of English fiction, a view shared by Ian Watt, who helped shape the scholarly debate regarding the genre of the novel, did much to cement Austen's reputation amongst academics. They agreed that she [...] "combined [...] qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both".|$|E

Methods: A total of 64 patients with chronic kidney disease were enrolled into the prospective, pre–post study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The knowledge, <b>attitude,</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> of patients regarding chronic kidney disease were assessed and recorded via baseline questionnaire. Case group patients were counseled regarding chronic kidney disease, their medication, diet, and lifestyle, and they were also provided with informative leaflet, whereas in the control group patients, the pharmacist did not intervene. After 1 -month intervention, knowledge, <b>attitude,</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> scores of patients of both groups were measured using the same knowledge, <b>attitude,</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> questionnaire. Effectiveness of counseling on case group patients was evaluated by comparing the mean knowledge, <b>attitude,</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> scores before <b>and</b> after counseling by paired t-test. Results: Mean knowledge, <b>attitude,</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> scores before intervention were 8. 16 ± 4. 378, 38. 19 ± 3. 217, and 6. 69 ± 0. 896, respectively, and these scores were changed to 13. 75 ± 3. 510, 38. 78 ± 3. 035, and 6. 91 ± 0. 777, respectively, after the intervention (p < 0. 05).

Aims: The aim was to assess the knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> regarding handling of extracted teeth among the students of a dental college in Bhopal. Materials and Methods: A self-designed, close-ended questionnaire containing 16 questions was distributed to 500 students including the undergraduates and postgraduate students of a dental college in Bhopal. The questionnaire comprised 5 questions on knowledge, 5 on <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> 6 on the practice towards handling of extracted human teeth. The responses were coded and entered in Microsoft excel and analyzed using SPSS 14. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the mean knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> scores across genders. Statistical significance of mean knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> scores across year of study was assessed using Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Of the 500 questionnaires distributed, 412 were returned with a response rate of 82. 4 %.
