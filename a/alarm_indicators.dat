40|$|Objective/backgroundTo {{conduct a}} {{comprehensive}} review of cases, presentation, diagnosis, and management of angiosarcoma in arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) created for haemodialysis. MethodsTwo authors independently conducted systematic searches and extraction of articles from the Embase, AMED, Health Management Information Consortium, and MEDLINE databases in keeping with the inclusion/exclusion criteria and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses standards. ResultsTwenty-two unique patient cases were identified; 20 of the cases were men and mean ± SD age of presentation was 54. 9  ±  13. 6 years. Nineteen cases were post-transplant and 18 were on antirejection agents. The most common presenting symptom was pain, with or without a mass. The initial diagnosis was most often thrombosis/infection of the AVF and the diagnostic interval to a correct diagnosis of angiosarcoma was between 2 and 40 weeks. Mean ± SD time to presentation of symptoms from fistula formation was 118. 9  ±  57. 5 months, while from transplant it was 96. 9  ±  70. 0 months. Amputation was the most common treatment modality and mean ± SD survival was 8. 8  ±  3. 7 months. ConclusionAngiosarcoma should be suspected in previously quiescent AVF that presents with pain.

Other factors that may affect PA (economical, environmental, socio-cultural, etc.) are intensively monitored in relation to the quality of life. Regionally related conditions for the realization of leisure PA can improve the differences in the level of PA in different population groups. AIMS: The aim of this study was to analyze physical activity of the population of the Eastern Bohemian region (Hradec Králové, Pardubice and Vysočina) regarding the education and socioeconomic status. METHODS: Term "Eastern Bohemian" region was used to sum the data collected from regions of Hradec Králové, Pardubice and Vysočina. To determine the weekly level of PA we used a randomized data set of 1273 people from the Eastern Bohemian region (555 men and 718 women) aged 41. 03 &# 177; 9. 16 years. All respondents were asked personally by educated distributors (university students) to participate in a research study using the Czech version of the IPAQ questionnaire. Data collection was carried out regularly in Spring (March-May) and Autumn (September-November) period from 2005 to 2009. RESULTS: People with higher education (university degree) have a lower amount of weekly PA than people with lower type of education (primary and secondary). People with secondary school education reported the highest amount of realized PA. There is diversified socioeconomic status (SES) in the Eastern Bohemian region. People with higher SES reported a lower level of realized PA than people with lower SES. CONCLUSIONS: The high loss of PA in university educated population is an <b>alarming</b> <b>indicator</b> of possible health complications. This group should be targeted in prevention health programs. Natural attractiveness should be maintained and opportunities made available for the realization of cultural, cycling and hiking trips.

Computed at the European level, the Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) gives a synthetic and synoptic overview of the drought situation using a classification scheme. Derived from {{the integration of the}} three individual indices, this classification scheme is composed of three warning levels: "watch" when a relevant precipitation shortage is observed, "warning" when this precipitation shortage translates into a soil moisture anomaly, and "alert" when these two conditions are accompanied by an anomaly in the vegetation condition. The design of the CDI includes the study {{of the relationship between the}} three individual indices. To achieve this, the SPI- 3 (3 -month SPI) was computed using the precipitation data obtained from a set of weather stations located in different agricultural areas of Europe, while the soil moisture and fAPAR data were extracted from the pixels of the respective grids surrounding these stations. The CDI is assessed for the main drought episodes of Europe between 2000 and 2011, using reported data from different sources, such as the EM-DAT Emergency Events Database and Eurostat annual yield estimates. The capability of the CDI to serve for drought early warning is evaluated as well as its robustness against false <b>alarms.</b> The <b>indicator</b> has been spatially implemented for the entire continent using different information layers of the European Drought Observatory.

Major emerging economies from Central and Eastern Europe are post- communist countries that faced transition after adopting market-based economy and become emerging markets. An important issue during transition was the creation of a two-pillar banking system (e. g. Central Bank and commercial banks), while bank restructuring involves not only profit performing banks but, more importantly, changes in lending practice. The difficulty of restructuring and the magnitude of recapitalization slowed significantly the achievement of independent governance by privatization in state-owned banks. After a short period of market-based economy, emerging countries had been affected by the crisis started in the developed countries (characterized by lower growth, higher unemployment and poverty, and changes in inequality). Through several channels, crisis had affected also emerging countries differently, depending {{on the extent to which}} they are vulnerable to particular canals. Romania's status in the context of transition bears the characteristics determined by the situation inherited from the centralized economy and the options of political forces after 1989.

The original driver of this investigation was that Offshore Platforms in the Norwegian Continental Shelf do not utilize IMS for Alarm Management KPI generation, despite their intense utilization of IMS for other purposes. Technical reasons for this practice are not known. In order to evaluate the current capacity of IMS in alarm KPI generation, a minimum required set of KPIs was established although different standards show variations between KPIs.

The proposals have been made by gathering information and analyzing data obtained from this fleet during its operation. The fan belt condition indicator provides an early warning by measuring the level of wear and tear of the fan belt. The conventional engine temperature indicator has been replaced with an electronic temperature sensor to provide real time engine temperature indicator. It also incorporates an alarm to warn of dangerously high temperatures to the vehicle operator. The weight of cargo loaded to the vehicle is measured through shockabsorber mounted displacement sensors, providing the operator with an accurate indication of the load on the vehicle prior to starting the journey. Further, an engine running hours counter provides an indication of actual engine running period, making it easy to identify proper time for oil changing. All the above features are consolidated in to a single display unit on the dashboard using electronic communication system. This unit called “Engine Quality Monitoring Unit” will greatly help the maintenance crew to prepare a proper maintenance schedule, fine tuned for each vehicle in the fleet...|$|R
