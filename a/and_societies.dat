5|$|Due to {{attitudes in}} Western {{medicine}} in the 1940s and 1950s, Native American and Fijian cultures <b>and</b> <b>societies</b> were strongly dissuaded from premastication due to concerns about the hygiene of the practice.

30|$|Second, it {{is worth}} giving {{consideration}} to both economic growth <b>and</b> <b>society’s</b> development. Economic growth <b>and</b> <b>society</b> development can have four kinds of combinations: economy grows <b>and</b> <b>society</b> develops, economy grows while society does not develop, economy does not grow <b>and</b> <b>society</b> does not develop, economy does not grow while economy develops. China is trying to achieve the goal of economy grows <b>and</b> <b>society</b> develops, which includes improving the ecological environment, and improving the city and country dual structure. The previous growth pattern was, arguably, biased toward economic growth while neglecting environment <b>and</b> <b>society</b> development, which potentially leads to unsustainable development. Now, {{it is time to}} adjust the former way. This strategy has been reflected in the government’s recent policy changes, and in particular the decision of the CPC Central Committee which was announced in November 2013. That policy announced that environmental protection is an important indicator in evaluating China’s sustainability.|$|R
