2500|$|Eurogamer's Martin Robinson scored it 7 out of 10, {{praising the}} {{graphics}} and atmosphere; [...] "sense of place is what elevates Deadlight, and it's intelligently explored by Tequila Works. <b>Abandoned</b> <b>traffic</b> jams on grey-lit freeways {{give way to}} rain-specked neon motel signs and then murky edgelands. In the city, Randall leaps across fire escapes and evades chasing helicopters in Canabalt-esque rooftop chases, and in the suburbs he bounds {{from house to house}} while racing past destroyed domestic scenes. Never has a 2D world felt so believable." [...] However, he was critical of the game's brevity, calling it [...] "an incredibly slight experience", and arguing [...] "there's not enough meat to come back to, making this a one-shot affair with a bloated price tag that doesn't quite fit." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Spit Bridge forms part of {{the route}} from the Sydney central {{business}} district and Lower North Shore suburbs to [...] and the Northern Beaches. The next crossing is some distance upstream (north-west) at Roseville Bridge. The Roads and Traffic Authority announced in August 2006 that tenders had been called for widening of the bridge to six lanes, with two extra traffic lanes and a pedestrian/cycleway being added on the western side, and upgrades to the lifting mechanism. Construction was to have begun in 2007, however, the project was scrapped in May of that year. According to the government {{this was due to}} technical and engineering difficulties, according to the opposition it was because of political considerations. The increased cost estimates to $115m were deemed to be not justifiable by the Minister for Roads Eric Roozendaal and the fiveyear plan was <b>abandoned.</b> <b>Traffic</b> delays either side of The Spit Bridge have been a problem for many years, not only on the approaches to the bridge itself, but also far up the hills on either side. Proposals to ameliorate delays have included widening the bridge, a tunnel linking the Warringah Expressway and the Burnt Bridge Creek Deviation, and a high-level bridge in place of the existing one. David Barr, the member for Manly, claimed in 2002 that the latter two were too expensive with $200 million estimated for a high-level bridge, and $1 billion for the tunnel.|$|E
30|$|In Europe the {{withdrawal}} of services {{and the removal of}} infrastructure that previously supported wagonload freight has been an ongoing feature as rail has retreated or <b>abandoned</b> <b>traffic</b> primarily to road services. In addition rail in Europe has been less-well focused in terms of developing new sidings and industrial sites with a rail connection {{as an integral part of}} the railway’s product and service portfolio compared to North America as commercial and industrial criteria and siting requirements have evolved. Some national railway operators in Europe (e.g. SNCF) have again been considering the reduction or abolition of wagonload traffic activities as a cost saving measure. Reducing the cost of operation, enhancing productivity and generating net new incremental revenue to achieve profitability do not appear to have been synchronised initiatives to maintain wagonload activities as part of a portfolio of rail freight services.|$|E

50|$|In 1936, at the {{instigation}} of the Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen (Company for the Exploitation of the State Railways, {{the operator}} {{of the section}} of the line in the Netherlands), the section between Venlo, Straelen and Geldern Ost was closed, <b>abandoning</b> international <b>traffic</b> for the first time.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Bowen found an <b>abandoned</b> cement <b>traffic</b> barrier in Golden Gate Park and {{claimed to have}} {{transformed}} it into a Shiva lingam. It then became a site of worship and veneration until the authorities had him remove it. At that time, {{he was known as}} Baba Kali Das.|$|R
25|$|The Swedish American Line was {{amongst the}} first {{companies}} to build liners with provisions for off-season cruising, {{as well as}} the first company to build a diesel-engined transatlantic liner. Increased operational costs and stronger competition from aeroplanes forced the company to <b>abandon</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> in 1975, but cargo operations continued until the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|On 2 June 1984, the {{passenger}} services were finally abandoned between Osnabrück and Dissen-Rothenfelde. Freight traffic continued on this section until 31 May 1991, {{but at the}} beginning of the 1990s Deutsche Bahn (DB) wanted to <b>abandon</b> freight <b>traffic</b> and to dismantle the track northwest of Dissen-Rothenfelde. This was prevented by a citizens' initiative called the Initiative Haller Willem.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bridge was}} {{bypassed}} and <b>abandoned</b> for vehicle <b>traffic</b> in 1985 when a reinforced concrete {{box girder bridge}} replaced the older bridge. The new bridge is named after Italian immigrant Silvio [...] "Botchie" [...] Santi.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, the {{suburban}} electrical services {{were incorporated into}} the Stuttgart S-Bahn project. Weil der Stadt would be the terminus of a line. On 1 October 1978, Deutsche Bundesbahn launched operations S-Bahn line S 6. This finally ended continuous operations from Stuttgart to Calw. Deutsche Bundesbahn operated Uerdingen railbuses between Weil der Stadt and Calw until 29 May 1983, when passenger services were <b>abandoned.</b> Freight <b>traffic</b> to Althengstett ended after a landslide at Ostelsheim in March 1988.|$|R
50|$|Despite an {{agreement}} between Deutsche Bahn {{and the state of}} Thuringia of 15 May 1997 for the partial double-tracking of the line and upgrading of the line for tilting trains, a decision had already been taken that year to discontinue long-distance services on the line. The reason was a decision of Deutsche Bahn to <b>abandon</b> InterRegio <b>traffic</b> nationwide. In 1999, two years before the closing of long distance passenger services in 2001, scheduled freight traffic was closed between Gera and Weimar on the Mid-German Connection.|$|R
5|$|An inquiry {{was held}} into {{widening}} the section from the Archway intersection to the Hornsey Lane Bridge to a three lane dual carriageway in 1969 and work started in 1971. It was {{originally intended to}} widen a further section of the road, but severe disruption led to the first inquiry being abandoned in 1978, and a second inquiry in 1984, chaired by Air Marshal Sir Michael Giddings, was also <b>abandoned.</b> The <b>traffic</b> flow was projected to increase to 180,000 cars a day by 1981, but by 1986 the actual flow was only 30,000 a day.|$|R
50|$|A {{small part}} of the line, from East Corning west through Corning to Painted Post, is not the former Erie but the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, opened in 1882 by the New York, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. After the Erie and Lackawanna merged to form the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad, that portion of the former Erie was <b>abandoned</b> and <b>traffic</b> was rerouted to the ex-Lackawanna. The EL was taken over by Conrail in 1976, and in the 1999 Conrail breakup the Southern Tier Line was {{assigned}} to Norfolk Southern.|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 1970s, the {{military}} <b>abandoned</b> regular <b>traffic</b> on the line. The southern track was pulled up by enthusiasts from the Urskog–Høland Line, which used the track for their heritage railway. The middle track was lifted to make room for a firing range. However, {{the military}} has retained maintenance of the line so that it at any time is in operational condition, as it had high strategic importance should war break out. During the construction of the European Route E6, it was decided that a new bridge be built over the line, financed by the military budget.|$|R
50|$|After {{construction}} of the Holland Tunnel the ferry portion was <b>abandoned</b> and <b>traffic</b> travelled over Bergen Hill to connect with Hudson Boulevard. A reroute in 1928 took the Lincoln Highway onto the new Route 1 Extension (now U.S. Route 1/9) from east of downtown Newark to North Avenue in Elizabeth, and west on North Avenue {{back to the old}} road. The Highway was also moved to the new Holland Tunnel and approach east of the Hudson County Boulevard (now Route 139). By then the U.S. Highway System was marked, and the Lincoln Highway was fading in importance.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, Deutsche Bahn <b>abandoned</b> {{scheduled}} freight <b>traffic</b> {{throughout the}} Oberbergischer Kreis. After that passenger services ran {{only as far}} as Gummersbach, but, since 2003, they have been extended to Marienheide. Since May 2007, the Rhein-Sieg-Eisenbahn has occasionally operated freight traffic as required from the junction of the Siegburg-Olpe railway with the Wiehl Valley Railway (Wiehltalbahn) towards Cologne.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1973, the EBOE had <b>abandoned</b> freight <b>traffic</b> from Barmstedt. For {{some time}} the AKN still ran freight from Alveslohe via Ulzburg to Henstedt. It was {{possible}} to operate freight between Ulzburg and Blumendorf until 31 December 1981. The four km-long remnant from Blumendorf station to Bad Oldesloe was operated as an industrial mainline track from Bad Oldesloe. The track between Ulzburg and Blumendorf has long since been dismantled. The trackless route has been converted to a cycle path. There are information boards close to this cycle path in the Wakendorf II area and it is Europe's longest path through fruit trees.|$|R
5000|$|BAR {{passenger}} train service ended in 1961. [...] Bus service, {{which began in}} 1936, continued with buses lettered for Bangor and Aroostook running on Greyhound Lines schedules between Aroostook County and New York City's Port Authority Bus Terminal until 1984. [...] The Greenville branch was dismantled from 1962 to 1964. Several Aroostook County segments were <b>abandoned</b> when potato <b>traffic</b> disappeared in the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|After the nationalisation, the {{passenger}} service from Osterfeld nord to Duisburg Hbf {{was closed and}} instead passenger services ran to Oberhausen Central Station. At {{the end of the}} Second World War in 1945, all the bridges over the Rhine-Herne Canal and the Emscher river were blown up by the Wehrmacht. Passenger services were <b>abandoned</b> and freight <b>traffic</b> was later restored over a new bridge.|$|R
50|$|On 1 May 1914, the Wohra Valley Railway {{was opened}} to Gemünden via Rauschenberg. As at 28 May 1972, {{passenger}} services, which had fallen sharply, were <b>abandoned</b> altogether. Freight <b>traffic</b> has not operated {{on the line}} since 19 December 1981. On 31 December 1981, the entire Wohra Valley Railway {{was reduced to a}} 200 m long section in Kirchhain, which is now used as a siding.|$|R
50|$|The East Pennsylvania Railroad {{opened on}} May 11, 1859, {{connecting}} Allentown and Reading. As a result, the Allentown Railroad project was <b>abandoned</b> as <b>traffic</b> could move between Allentown and Reading on the East Pennsylvania Railroad and north to Auburn along the Reading Railroad mainine. In the early 1870s, the Reading Railroad laid track along the grade of the Allentown Railroad between Kutztown and the East Pennsylvania Railroad in Topton. The Allentown Railroad was formally merged into the Reading Railroad on December 31, 1945. Following the bankruptcy and {{consolidation of the}} Reading Railroad into Conrail, the Kutztown Transportation Authority took over the line. The East Penn Railroad later operated freight service on the line between Kutztown and Topton.|$|R
25|$|Train loads were {{restricted}} {{through the}} tunnel section, and there was little scope for running longer and fewer trains. More paths were available for goods trains after the cessation of passenger services in 1916. Freight traffic continued and was of considerable importance in both World Wars. With the decline of wagonload freight traffic from the 1960s and the National Freight Train Plan of 1968, more use {{was made of the}} West London Line, allowing the Widened Lines to be <b>abandoned</b> for such <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{originally}} the western terminus of the Toledo, Peoria & Western Railroad. Today, it serves the Keokuk Junction Railway {{with an occasional}} train crossings for interconnection and river terminal services. Only the Keokuk {{side of the highway}} bridge has been converted, the bridge's upper highway deck is <b>abandoned.</b> The river <b>traffic</b> (barges and boats) have the right-of-way, so the swing section remains open until a train needs to cross the river.It is documented in the Library of Congress Historic American Engineering Record as survey number IA-3.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main line}} {{followed}} {{the route of}} the original Gorseddau Tramway from Porthmadog through Tremadoc, Penmorfa and Ynys-y-Pandy to Gorseddau quarry. On conversion, the line from Porthmadog to Braich-y-bib, just north of Ynys-y-Pandy, was regauged in [...] A new extension was added from Braich-y-bib. This led west along the Cwm Pennant before heading north to Cwm Trwsgl where inclines served the Prince of Wales and Dol-ifan-Gethin slate quarries and the Cwm Dywfor copper and lead mine. This branch added an additional 5 miles to the length of the railway, for a total length of 13 miles. At Porthmadog the last few hundred yards of the original Gorseddau route were <b>abandoned</b> and <b>traffic</b> was worked to the wharves over the Croesor Tramway. At around the same time the line from Braich-y-bib to Gorseddau quarry had been abandoned. The Prince of Wales quarry supplied most of the traffic for the railway during its existence.|$|R
50|$|The Saudi Government has not {{improved}} {{its efforts to}} protect victims of trafficking but continues to operate three shelters for abused female expatriate workers in Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam. It also operates facilities for <b>abandoned</b> children, including <b>trafficking</b> victims, in Jeddah, Mecca, and Medina. However, {{the government does not}} provide shelter to adult male workers. There are many NGOs working with trafficking victims. The government mediates disputes and alleged abuses of foreign workers — including complaints of a criminal nature — and seeks to return victims to their home countries without adequately investigating and prosecuting crimes committed against them.|$|R

2500|$|In 1970 SAL's {{passenger}} ships {{made only}} three transatlantic crossings, and from 1971 onwards the only crossings made were repositioning cruises. In June 1972 the Swedish American Line purchased the expedition cruise ship [...] via their Panama-based subsidiary United Cruising Co. Unlike other SAL passenger vessels, the Lindblad Explorer was registered in Panama, not Sweden. Increased operational costs of Swedish-flagged ships forced {{the company to}} start negotiations with Swedish trade unions for re-flagging the Gripsholm and Kungsholm. The negotiations failed however, and 22 March 1975 the company decided to <b>abandon</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> despite protests from the company's United States offices, according to whom the ships would have continued to be highly profitable even under the Swedish flag. The Gripsholm and Kungsholm were taken out-of-service and laid up in August 1975. The Kungsholm was sold to Flagship Cruises in October {{of the same year}} for only 65 million Swedish krona, a half of what SAL had paid for her nine years earlier. Flagship maintained her under the name Kungsholm for cruising under Liberian flag. The Gripsholm found a buyer in November when she was sold to Karageorgis Lines, Greece, becoming their MS Navarino. The Lindblad Explorer however stayed under SAL's ownership. At the end of 1975 SAL withdrew from Atlantic Gulf Services.|$|R
50|$|It {{is often}} mistakenly assumed that Mozarab merchants forged a vital {{commercial}} and cultural {{link between the}} north and south across the Iberian frontiers. Mozarab refugees may have had influence in northern Iberian trade at places like Toledo, but {{there is no reason to}} believe that they engaged in commerce with their <b>abandoned</b> homeland. Most <b>traffic</b> between Al-Andalus and Christian regions remained in the hands of Jewish and Muslim traders until the dramatic shifts initiated by European commercial expansion throughout the 11th and 12th centuries. With the development of Italian maritime power and southward expansion of the Christian Reconquista, Andalusi international trade came increasingly into the control of Christian traders from northern Iberia, southern France, or Italy and by the middle of the 13th century was an exclusively Christian concern.|$|R
2500|$|In 1887, Walter Rye was {{appointed}} as the clerk and noticed {{a number of}} irregularities {{in the way the}} company ran. Edward Press was the general manager, although he was disqualified from the post as he profited from the canal, and there was no treasurer, {{despite the fact that the}} enabling act required one to be appointed. There was also no way to wind up the company. Rye's concerns were ignored, as nothing changed, and Press continued to run the canal. In 1893, the upper [...] from Swafield lock to Antingham were <b>abandoned,</b> but <b>traffic</b> figures for 1898 show that 6,386 tons arrived at wharves on the canal, 5,000 tons were loaded for shipping, and 400 tons were carried within the confines of the canal. Trade declined steadily but Press was an early advocate of canal tourism. He published an advert in the 1888 volume, Handbook of the Rivers and Broads of Norfold and Suffolk, which described the various wherries which could be hired. The boats came with two crew members, and contained a ladies cabin and a gentlemen's cabin, which could also be used as a day saloon. Press died on 2 July 1906, and a director of the General Estates Company called Mr Percy bought the canal at an auction held on 11 September 1907, for £2,550.|$|R
50|$|However, it {{was soon}} evident that the narrow-gauge {{railways}} were not always up to task for all cargo demands. Mainly, the transloading of freight between the breaks of gauge was time consuming and expensive. To avoid additional cargo handling on the Dresden-Klotzsche-Königsbrück line, a container system was tested ("Umsetzkästen") in which the whole cargo box of a freight car was transferred between standard and narrow-gauge frames. Since this railway was converted to standard gauge shortly after, the tests were <b>abandoned.</b> Instead, roll-block <b>traffic</b> was now favored. However, {{it was soon}} evident that piggy-backing standard-gauge freight cars onto the narrow-gauge tracks {{did not meet the}} initial goals of operating the narrow-gauge railways on a very small budget: The railways needed large investments to reinforce the tracks, increase the structure gauge to accommodate a larger loading gauge and to acquire stronger steam locomotives.|$|R

In 1990 two new domestic terminals called [...] "Domestic 2 and 3" [...] were built south of the first domestic terminal. In 1992 the terminal 2 was partly <b>abandoned</b> because of <b>traffic</b> decrease.

However, a recession in 2002 delayed its opening until 2003. At that time protests were raised by people living under its flight path in the municipality of Upplands Väsby. Traffic has recovered since and is now showing healthy increases but the third runway is only used during peak hours for environmental reasons. In September 2010 the first Airbus A380 superjumbo landed at the airport.|$|R

Brasil was rebuilt and renamed Homeland in 1951, coinciding with her move to Hamburg—Southampton—Halifax—New York service. While on this route she was managed by Hamburg-America Line. However, the Homeland {{was transferred}} to Genoa—Naples—Barcelona—New York service already in 1952, after being replaced by the Italia on the Germany—New York service. The Italia in turn came to be managed by Hamburg-America Line while on the service from Germany. The Argentina was sold to Zim Lines in 1953 and renamed Jerusalem, while the Atlantic {{was transferred to}} National Hellenic American Line in 1954 and renamed Queen Frederica. Home Lines had purchased the laid-up Mariposa from Matson Lines in 1953; she entered service in 1954 as the first Homeric. By 1955 at the latest Home Lines began making cruises from New York to The Bahamas during the winter season. The Homeland was sold for scrap in 1955, leaving Home Lines with just two ships, Italia and Homeric. In 1958 Home Lines <b>abandoned</b> transatlantic <b>traffic</b> to New York (leaving it to Hamburg Atlantic Line). In the same year the Italia was refitted and placed on Hamburg—Quebec service.
