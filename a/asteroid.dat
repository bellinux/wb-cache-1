5|$|Juno, minor-planet {{designation}} 3 Juno in the Minor Planet Center catalogue system, is an <b>asteroid</b> in the <b>asteroid</b> belt. Juno was {{the third}} <b>asteroid</b> discovered, in 1804, by German astronomer Karl Harding. It is the 11th-largest <b>asteroid,</b> {{and one of the}} two largest stony (S-type) asteroids, along with 15 Eunomia. It is estimated to contain 1% of the total mass of the <b>asteroid</b> belt.|$|E
5|$|Among his discoveries was the <b>asteroid</b> 253 Mathilde, {{found on}} November 12, 1885. The initial orbital {{elements}} of the <b>asteroid</b> were then computed by V. A. Lebeuf, another Austrian astronomer working at the Paris Observatory. The name of the <b>asteroid</b> was suggested by Lebeuf, after Mathilde, the wife of Moritz Loewywho was the vice director of the observatory in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Asteroids in the <b>asteroid</b> belt {{are divided}} into <b>asteroid</b> groups and {{families}} based on their orbital characteristics. <b>Asteroid</b> moons are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids. They are not as clearly distinguished as planetary moons, sometimes being almost as large as their partners. The <b>asteroid</b> belt also contains main-belt comets, {{which may have been}} the source of Earth's water.|$|E

50|$|Of the 222 near-Earth <b>asteroids</b> (NEAs), 43 of {{them are}} {{considered}} potentially hazardous <b>asteroids</b> (PHAs), {{a subset of the}} much larger family of NEOs, but particularly more likely to hit Earth and cause significant destruction. NEOs can be divided into NECs (comets only) and NEAs (<b>asteroids</b> only), and further into subcategories such as Atira or Apohele <b>asteroids,</b> Aten <b>asteroids,</b> Apollo <b>asteroids,</b> Amor <b>asteroids</b> and the potentially hazardous <b>asteroids</b> (PHAs).|$|R
50|$|<b>Asteroids</b> in the Nysa {{family are}} {{typically}} divided into two, mineralogically different subgroups: Nysa and Polana. Aside from 44 Nysa and 135 Hertha, <b>asteroids</b> in the Nysian subgroup are S-type <b>asteroids.</b> <b>Asteroids</b> in the Polanian subgroup, like 142 Polana, are F-type <b>asteroids.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ceres, the <b>asteroid</b> belt's only dwarf planet, {{is about}} 950km in diameter, whereas 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, and 10 Hygiea have mean diameters {{of less than}} 600km. The {{remaining}} bodies range down {{to the size of}} a dust particle. The <b>asteroid</b> material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident. Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids do occur, and these can produce an <b>asteroid</b> family whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within the <b>asteroid</b> belt are categorized by their spectra, with most falling into three basic groups: carbonaceous (C-type), silicate (S-type), and metal-rich (M-type).|$|E
5|$|Mathilde {{was once}} a planet in the making before being {{involved}} in a collision with another object making it the <b>asteroid</b> that it is today. Speculations do range as {{it may have been}} the solar system's true 9th planet (other than Pluto), previously being an equal rival that of Ceres. This <b>asteroid</b> was visited by the NEARShoemaker spacecraft during June 1997, on its way to <b>asteroid</b> 433Eros. During the flyby, the spacecraft imaged a hemisphere of the <b>asteroid,</b> revealing many large craters that had gouged out depressions in the surface. It was the first carbonaceous <b>asteroid</b> to be explored and, until 21Lutetia was visited in 2010, was the largest <b>asteroid</b> to be visited by a spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The <b>asteroid</b> belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly {{between the}} orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is {{occupied}} by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The <b>asteroid</b> belt is also termed the main <b>asteroid</b> belt or main belt to distinguish it from other <b>asteroid</b> populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half {{the mass of the}} belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the <b>asteroid</b> belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200km).|$|E

5000|$|Apollo <b>asteroids</b> {{are those}} <b>asteroids</b> with a semimajor axis greater than Earth's, while having a {{perihelion}} distance of 1.017 AU or less. Like Aten <b>asteroids,</b> Apollo <b>asteroids</b> are Earth-crossers.|$|R
50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to destroy all the <b>asteroids</b> which have a set speed at which they fly through the Sector. <b>Asteroids</b> come in varying sizes, and when shot, larger <b>asteroids</b> break into {{multiple}} smaller ones. Only shooting the smallest ones will actually remove them from the Sector. <b>Asteroids</b> also come in different types. Normal <b>asteroids</b> don't contain anything, but red <b>asteroids</b> can contain power-ups in the form of Power Crystals that are released by completely destroying <b>asteroids.</b> Crystals decay over time. Popcorn <b>Asteroids</b> require several hits, which expands their size, and eventually makes them stop spinning. They can't be destroyed, but stopping them is enough to finish each Sector. Egg <b>asteroids</b> contain leeches which home in on the user's ship and suck out its energy. They can be shot and destroyed. Finally there are Seeker <b>asteroids</b> which home in on the player's ship after being shot.|$|R
5|$|The <b>asteroid</b> belt {{occupies}} the orbit between Mars and Jupiter, between 2.3 and 3.3AU from the Sun. It {{is thought to}} be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter. The <b>asteroid</b> belt contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometre in diameter. Despite this, the total mass of the <b>asteroid</b> belt is unlikely {{to be more than a}} thousandth of that of Earth. The <b>asteroid</b> belt is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident.|$|E
5|$|The data {{returned}} from the Galileo flybys of Gaspra and Ida, and the later NEAR Shoemaker <b>asteroid</b> mission, permitted the first study of <b>asteroid</b> geology. Ida's relatively large surface exhibited a diverse range of geological features. The discovery of Ida's moon Dactyl, the first confirmed satellite of an <b>asteroid,</b> provided additional insights into Ida's composition.|$|E
5|$|The high {{population}} of the <b>asteroid</b> belt makes for a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years. A collision may fragment an <b>asteroid</b> into numerous smaller pieces (leading {{to the formation of}} a new <b>asteroid</b> family). Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of the <b>asteroid</b> belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>asteroid's</b> orbit must {{be outside}} {{the orbit of}} Earth (like the {{majority}} of <b>asteroids).</b> <b>Asteroids</b> that come close to Earth whose orbits are inside Earth's orbit are considered Apohele <b>asteroids</b> (although not all Apoheles necessarily get close to Earth).|$|R
5|$|The current belt {{consists}} {{primarily of}} {{three categories of}} asteroids: C-type or carbonaceous <b>asteroids,</b> S-type or silicate <b>asteroids,</b> and M-type or metallic <b>asteroids.</b>|$|R
50|$|From the {{perspective}} of Earth, the only types of <b>asteroids</b> that can transit the Sun are those with orbits that take them between the two bodies. These include Aten <b>asteroids</b> (including Apohele <b>asteroids</b> and the hypothetical Vulcanoid <b>asteroids)</b> and some Apollo <b>asteroids</b> (perhaps including quasi-satellites of Earth). Unfortunately, observations of such transits are difficult because all of these <b>asteroids</b> {{are only a few}} kilometres in diameter at most, so that their angular diameter is too tiny to observe against the Sun.|$|R
5|$|Three {{prominent}} {{bands of}} dust {{have been found}} within the <b>asteroid</b> belt. These have similar orbital inclinations as the Eos, Koronis, and Themis <b>asteroid</b> families, and so are possibly associated with those groupings.|$|E
5|$|Vesta is the second-most-massive and second-largest {{body in the}} <b>asteroid</b> belt {{after the}} dwarf planet Ceres, and it {{contributes}} an estimated 9% {{of the mass of}} the <b>asteroid</b> belt.|$|E
5|$|After rescuing all the Tribals and {{restoring}} the starship with several needed parts, the team, along with King Jeff, departs to the <b>asteroid</b> and confront Mizar. To {{the surprise of}} all though, Mizar is revealed to be a robot controlled by King Jeff's jealous brother, Barry. Realising that destroying Barry's robot ruined their best chance of destroying the <b>asteroid,</b> the team is out of options. In an honorable notion, Floyd, a little robot that defected from Mizar and followed the team, offers to sacrifice himself to destroy the <b>asteroid.</b> Hesitantly, the team agrees and attaches a timed warhead to Floyd before sending him into the core. The team returns to the starship and departs shortly before Floyd destroys the <b>asteroid.</b> Afterwards on Earth, the Jet Force Gemini team is given the highest honors for their accomplishments.|$|E
25|$|Near-Earth <b>asteroids,</b> or NEAs, are <b>asteroids</b> {{that have}} orbits that pass {{close to that}} of Earth. <b>Asteroids</b> that {{actually}} cross Earth's orbital path are known as Earth-crossers. , 14,464 near-Earth <b>asteroids</b> are known and the number over one kilometre in diameter {{is estimated to be}} 900–1,000.|$|R
50|$|Atira <b>asteroids</b> or Apohele <b>asteroids,</b> {{also known}} as Interior-Earth Objects (IEOs), are <b>asteroids,</b> whose orbits are entirely {{confined}} within Earth's orbit, that is, their orbit has an aphelion (farthest point from the Sun) smaller than Earth's perihelion (nearest point to the Sun), which is 0.983 astronomical units (AU). Atira <b>asteroids</b> {{are by far the}} smallest group of near-Earth objects, compared to the Aten, Apollo and Amor <b>asteroids.</b>|$|R

5|$|Along {{with the}} <b>asteroid</b> bodies, the <b>asteroid</b> belt also {{contains}} bands of dust with particle radii {{of up to}} a few hundred micrometres. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the Poynting–Robertson effect, the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the Sun.|$|E
5|$|An <b>asteroid,</b> 4422 Jarre, {{has been}} named in his honour. He is an honorary citizen of Gdansk.|$|E
5|$|As of October 2009, 190 <b>asteroid</b> moons and 63 trans-Neptunian moons {{had been}} discovered.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have led}} to unconventional models of certain <b>asteroids,</b> suggesting previously unsuspected forms. Some of these include binary <b>asteroids</b> (e. g., 532 Herculina, 18 Melpomene), very irregular <b>asteroids</b> (e. g., the Mars-crossing 1580 Betulia), and very elongated <b>asteroids,</b> unlikely to be collisional fragments (e. g., 624 Hector). A connection is suggested between this observational work and ongoing theoretical work concerning collisions of large comparable-sized <b>asteroids.</b> Such collisions have different consequences from the collisions usually considered.
