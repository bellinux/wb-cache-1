2500|$|On August 6, 2009, the CIA {{announced}} that Baitullah Mehsud {{was killed by}} a SAD/SOG drone strike in Pakistan. The New York Times said, [...] "Although President Obama has distanced himself from many of the Bush administration’s counter-terrorism policies, he has embraced and even expanded the C.I.A.’s covert campaign in Pakistan using Predator and Reaper drones". [...] The biggest loss may be to [...] "Osama bin Laden's al-Qa'ida". For the past eight years, al-Qaeda had depended on Mehsud for protection after Mullah Mohammed Omar fled Afghanistan in late 2001. [...] "Mehsud's death means the tent sheltering <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>has</b> collapsed," [...] an Afghan Taliban intelligence officer who had met Mehsud many times told Newsweek.

The Indian army also claims that {{there is no evidence of}} Al Qaed{{a presence in}} Jammu and Kashmir. <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>has</b> established bases in Pakistani administered Kashmir and some, including Robert Gates have suggested that they have helped to plan attacks in India.|$|E

50|$|Al Qaeda, on {{the other}} hand, {{represents}} a transnational threat-one very different in kind from that posed by the IRA or even newer groups such as Hamas. <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> <b>has</b> potentially thousands of members and no interest in bargaining with the United States or its allies.

The {{terrorist attack on}} the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon building in Washington, DC on 11 September 2011 —the so-called 9 / 11 attack—serves as reminder of the dire consequences and very real threat of a potential attack on a NPP.

Like ISIL, several Al Qaeda franchises are interested in taking and holding territory; AQAP has been much less successful at it. The main differences between Al Qaeda and ISIL are largely political—and personal.

The analyst said that Jaljalat and other groups in the Gaza Strip may be seeking to gain the support from al Qaeda by carrying out violent operations in Egypt.
