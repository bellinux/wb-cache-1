5|$|According to Dasgupta, {{the term}} yoga {{can be derived}} from either of two roots, yujir yoga (to yoke) or yuj samādhau (to concentrate). Someone who {{practices}} yoga or follows the yoga philosophy {{with a high level of}} commitment is called a yogi (may be <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> man or a woman) or yogini (traditionally denoting a woman).|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that when energy was <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> combination of gases like those in Titan's atmosphere, five nucleotide bases, the building blocks of DNA and RNA, were among the many compounds produced. In addition, amino acids, the building blocks of protein were found. It was the first time nucleotide bases and amino acids had been found in such an experiment without liquid water being present.|$|E

It <b>applies</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> Act of the Scottish Parliament as it <b>applies</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> [...] "Act".|$|R
5|$|Proponents {{of the use}} of {{leverage}} argue that using leverage can be risk-reducing rather than risk-increasing provided four conditions are met: (i) enough unencumbered cash is kept to meet any margin calls (ii) leverage is <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> well-diversified portfolio (iii) assets can be rebalanced frequently and (iv) counterparty risk is minimized.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E
5|$|The type genus, Lily (Lilium), has a {{long history}} in {{literature}} and art, and a tradition of symbolism as well as becoming a popular female name, and a floral emblem, particularly of France (fleur-de-lis). The cultivation of lilies has been described since at least the ninth century, when Charlemagne ordered it to be grown at his imperial palaces. However, the name 'lily' has historically been <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of plants other than the Lilium genus.|$|E
25|$|The term wavelength-division {{multiplexing}} {{is commonly}} <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> optical carrier, which is typically described by its wavelength, whereas frequency-division multiplexing typically <b>applies</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> radio carrier {{which is more}} often described by frequency. This is purely convention because wavelength and frequency communicate the same information.|$|R

5|$|Variable-speed drives {{can also}} run a motor in {{specialized}} patterns to further minimize mechanical and electrical stress. For example, an S-curve pattern can be <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> conveyor application for smoother deceleration and acceleration control, which reduces the backlash {{that can occur}} when a conveyor is accelerating or decelerating.|$|E
5|$|Although the Merger Agreements were principally {{intended}} for smaller, non-viable states, {{they were also}} <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> few larger states. Kutch in western India, and Tripura and Manipur in Northeast India, all of which lay along international borders, {{were also asked to}} sign Merger Agreements, despite being larger states, following which they became Chief Commissioners' Provinces. Bhopal, whose ruler was proud of the efficiency of his administration and feared that it would lose its identity if merged with the Maratha states that were its neighbours, also became a directly administered Chief Commissioner's Province, as did Bilaspur, much of which was likely to be flooded on completion of the Bhakra dam.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, {{alternative}} rock's mainstream prominence declined due to {{a number}} of events that caused grunge and Britpop to fade and led to the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival. Nevertheless, post-grunge remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century, with the commercial success of Creed and Matchbox Twenty; Radiohead's critical acclaim, and the success of some post-Britpop groups like Coldplay. Emo attracted attention in the larger alternative rock world, and the term was <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts. During the late 1990s and 2000s, other alternative rock bands emerged, including The White Stripes, The Strokes and Arcade Fire.|$|E

5|$|It is {{relatively}} {{difficult to separate}} ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides. The solution is then <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> resin, which different lanthanides bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to {{the different types of}} bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides, it is possible to isolate the compounds.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{the most}} {{extensive}} collection of phonetic data so far in Mongolian studies has been <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> partial account of stress placement in the closely related Chakhar dialect. The conclusion is drawn that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first syllable are stressed on the second syllable. But if their first syllable is long, then the data for different acoustic parameters seems to support conflicting conclusions: intensity data often {{seems to indicate that}} the first syllable is stressed, while F0 seems to indicate that it is the second syllable that is stressed.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{was used}} in earnest by the British Admiralty in the First World War. The marine artist Norman Wilkinson led research into dazzle camouflage, resulting in the painting of thousands of British and later American ships in dazzle patterns. He intended it not to make ships invisible, nor even to cause the enemy to miss his shot, but to deceive him into taking up a poor firing position. In the Second World War, dazzle was revisited by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, and <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> limited extent by other navies.|$|E
