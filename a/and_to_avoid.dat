5|$|As Faxai {{approached}} Japan, All Nippon Airways canceled day flights between Tokyo and the Izu Islands. Tokai Kisen, {{which operates}} ferries between Tokyo, the Izu Islands, and Shizuoka Prefecture, canceled some services {{due to the}} storm. Areas around Tokyo were notified of the expected heavy rains, waves up to 6m (19.6ft), and high winds. Residents were advised to stay indoors during the storm, especially after sunset, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> possible flying debris.|$|E
5|$|Following the war {{council of}} 20 June, Schuyler ordered St. Clair {{to hold out}} {{as long as he}} could, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> having his avenues of retreat cut off. Schuyler took command of a reserve force of 700 at Albany, and Washington ordered four regiments to be held in {{readiness}} at Peekskill, further down the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses use {{camouflage}} when hunting, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> predators. To do {{this they}} use specialised skin cells which change {{the appearance of}} the skin by adjusting its colour, opacity, or reflectivity. Chromatophores contain yellow, orange, red, brown, or black pigments; most species have three of these colours, while some have two or four. Other colour-changing cells are reflective iridophores and white leucophores. This colour-changing ability is also used to communicate with or warn other octopuses.|$|E

The US and UK do not have large domestic savings pools to draw on and therefore are dependent on external savings e.g. from China. This is not the case in the eurozone, which is self-funding.|$|E
5|$|Saint-Saëns was a keen traveller. From the 1870s {{until the}} end of his life he made 179 trips to 27 countries.

5|$|A {{number of}} other schemes for the {{remainder}} of the below-standard parts of the A303 were considered in the 1990s, including improvements west of Ilminster towards Marsh and the single-carriageway section around Yeovilton. These proposals were all cancelled in 1998. The schemes were remitted to the London to South West and South Wales Multi-Modal Study (SWARMMS), and the conclusion of the report was that all of the schemes east of Ilminster should go ahead; <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> building a dual carriageway through the Blackdown Hills the A358 should be upgraded to the M5 at Taunton. In 2009, none were considered to be regional priorities, so no other improvements were likely to be funded in the short term.|$|E
5|$|After the war, five Croatian {{fighters were}} charged and convicted of eleven counts of murder, one of {{attempted}} murder, {{and one of}} torture of Serb civilians found in the JNA barracks, which surrendered on 15 September 1991. They received prison sentences of between five and eight years. Glavaš, who was tried alongside them for the same crimes, received a ten-year sentence. Before the conviction became final in 2009, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> extradition, Glavaš fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he had granted citizenship. His sentence was reduced to eight years and became final in 2010, {{when he was arrested}} and imprisoned in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In January 2015, the conviction was set aside by the Constitutional Court of Croatia, pending a new trial before the Supreme Court of Croatia.|$|E
5|$|As {{the common}} name suggests, the fungus is highly toxic, and is {{responsible}} for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades, and , or half a cap, of this mushroom is estimated to be enough to kill a human. In 2006, a family of three in Poland was poisoned, resulting in one death and the two survivors requiring liver transplants. In 2017, 14 people in California were poisoned, including an 18 month old who required a liver transplant. Some authorities strongly advise against putting suspected death caps in the same basket with fungi collected for the table <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> even touching them. Furthermore, the toxicity is not reduced by cooking, freezing, or drying.|$|E

5|$|British Admiral George Brydges Rodney, who {{had been}} {{tracking}} de Grasse around the West Indies, was alerted to the latter's departure, but was uncertain of the French admiral's destination. Believing that de Grasse would return {{a portion of his}} fleet to Europe, Rodney detached Rear Admiral Sir Samuel Hood with 14 ships of the line and orders to find de Grasse's destination in North America. Rodney, who was ill, sailed for Europe {{with the rest of his}} fleet in order to recover, refit his fleet, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|By 1:00 pm, the two fleets were roughly {{facing each}} other, but sailing on {{opposite}} tacks. In order to engage, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> some shoals (known as the Middle Ground) {{near the mouth}} of the bay, Graves around 2:00 pm ordered his whole fleet to wear, a manoeuvre that reversed his line of battle, but enabled it to line up with the French fleet as its ships exited the bay. This placed the squadron of Hood, his most aggressive commander, {{at the rear of the}} line, and that of Admiral Francis Samuel Drake in the van.|$|E
5|$|During the {{pre-production}} phase, Venkatesh allocated bulk {{dates and}} the film's shoot {{was expected to}} be completed in a single schedule. Principal photography began in the locales of Kerala on 8 March 2014. Filming continued in the Idukki district of Kerala, where the original was primarily shot. The film's spokesperson told IANS that most of the film would be shot in Kerala, at locations similar to the original, except for a few scenes. Sripriya chose Kerala for two reasons– its greenery, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> local interference from crowds that would ensue if shot in Andhra Pradesh, where Venkatesh is a star. After filming crucial scenes at a few villages near Kochi for more than three weeks, the film's unit shot at Araku and Simhachalam beginning mid April 2014. Subsequently, they planned to continue at Vizianagaram.|$|E

5|$|Further, {{he points}} out that the {{language}} used by the Beowulf poet was already archaic, and the choice of words was at the time recognisably poetic. Tolkien gives as an example beorn, which meant both 'bear' and 'warrior', but only in heroic poetry could it be used to mean 'man'. He advises the translator to prefer 'striking' and 'smiting', <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> 'hitting' and 'whacking'. But on the other hand, he criticises William Morris for using the dead and unintelligible 'leeds' for OE leode ('freemen', 'people'; cf German leute), even if antiquarians feel that the word ought to have survived. Tolkien does not accept the etymological fallacy either: mod means 'pride', not 'mood'; burg is 'stronghold', not 'borough', even though the modern word derives from the old one.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Morton {{returned}} to the band. Two years later, the band released its first full-length self-titled album, Burn the Priest, through Legion Records. Mikey Brosnan of Legion Records saved up $2,500 for the recording and then broke them in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania through DIY shows. The album was produced by Today Is the Day guitarist and vocalist Steve Austin. Spear left the band, leaving an open position for a guitarist. Adler's younger brother Willie became the band's second guitarist a year later, and a deal with Prosthetic Records was signed. Contrary to rumour, the band did not change their name to Lamb of God after being banned from venues; these bans occurred afterwards. They changed their name because of the altered line-up, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> being mistaken for a satanic metal band.|$|E

5|$|Inside Cloud Gates {{polished}} exterior shell {{are several}} steel structures {{that keep the}} sculpture standing. The first structural pieces, two type 304 stainless steel rings, were put into place in February 2004. As construction continued, crisscrossing pipe trusses were assembled between the two rings. The trusses and supporting structures were only present for the construction phases. The finished sculpture has no inner bracing. The supporting structural components were designed and constructed {{to ensure that no}} specific point was overloaded, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> producing unwanted indentations on the exterior shell. The frame was also designed to expand and contract with the sculpture as temperatures fluctuate. As a result, the two large rings supporting the sculpture move independently of each other, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important to bury the dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.|$|E
5|$|Modern winter service {{vehicles}} will usually {{also have a}} satellite navigation system connected to a weather forecast feed, allowing the driver to choose the best areas to treat <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> areas in which rain is likely, which can wash away the grit used—the most advanced can even adapt to changing conditions, ensuring optimal gritter and plow settings. Most run on wheels, often with snow chains or studded tires, but some are mounted on caterpillar tracks, with the tracks themselves adapted to throw the snow towards {{the side of the}} road. Off-road winter {{service vehicles}} mounted on caterpillar tracks are known as snowcats. Snowcats are commonly fitted with snowplows or snow groomers, and are used by ski resorts to smooth and maintain pistes and snowmobile runs, although they can also be used as a replacement for chairlifts.|$|E
