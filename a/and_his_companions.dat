5|$|In 1305, Edward and {{his father}} quarrelled, {{probably}} {{over the issue of}} money. The Prince had an altercation with Bishop Walter Langton, who served as the royal treasurer, apparently over the amount of financial support Edward received from the Crown.

After some negotiations involving family members and friends, the two men were reconciled.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Alexander Shatravka {{published}} his book Pobeg iz Raya (Escape from Paradise) {{in which he}} described how he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> were caught after they illegally crossed the border between Finland and the Soviet Union {{to escape from the}} latter country and, as a result, were confined to Soviet psychiatric hospitals and prisons.

5|$|Lyon {{thought he}} could teach Yagan British ways and convert him to Christianity.

The Government did not pursue them; apparently its officials considered they had been sufficiently punished.|$|E
5|$|Written by Roger Dixon, {{this story}} was {{submitted}} on January 16, 1967. The basic story idea had the TARDIS bring the Doctor <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> to the Nevada Desert, where they discover they have been shrunk to a tenth of an inch in height.

5|$|Alcibiades, however, did {{not succeed}} in persuading the satrap to ally with the Athenians, and, to hide this fact, demanded (claiming to be {{speaking}} for Tissaphernes) greater and greater concessions of them until they finally refused to comply. Disenchanted with Alcibiades but still determined to overthrow the democracy, Peisander <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> returned to Samos, where the conspirators worked to secure their control over the army and encouraged a group of native Samian oligarchs to begin planning the overthrow of their own city's democracy. In Athens, meanwhile, a party of young oligarchic revolutionaries succeeded in gaining de facto control of the government through assassination and intimidation.|$|E
5|$|At first sight, Terahnee {{seems like}} a Utopia. Everyone lives in sumptuous palaces, and nobody goes hungry; in reality, the society is run by slave labor. After writing new Ages, the Terahnee people capture the {{inhabitants}} to use as slaves, considering themselves gods over their Ages. The Terahnee people are taught not to 'see' the slaves; only the servants interact with the lower orders. The Terahnee are suddenly stricken by a plague the D'ni brought with them; Atrus <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> help the Age's slaves recover and create a new society before returning to D'ni and sealing up the path to Terahnee.|$|E
5|$|Back on the ship, the Doctor <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> find several {{additional}} time windows and learn that each {{leads to a}} different moment in Madame de Pompadour's life. In one of them, the Doctor sees another clockwork creature menacing her and steps through the window to defend her. The Doctor tells Reinette to give the android orders, and it obeys her. It tells her {{that it is a}} repair android and that their spaceship was damaged in an ion storm. The androids did not have the parts necessary to repair the ship and killed the crew to use their organs for parts. The androids need one last part; Reinette's brain. Confused, the Doctor creates a telepathic link with Reinette, but is startled to find that she can also see into his mind. The androids capture Rose and Mickey and are about to harvest them for parts when the Doctor rescues them. The Doctor discovers that the androids plan to open a time window to Reinette's life at the age of 37, believing that her brain at that age will be compatible with the ship's systems. The clockwork androids appear at a costume ball and take Reinette and her guests hostage. At one end of the room is an enormous mirror, which is actually a time window. The Doctor <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> can see through it, but they cannot enter without smashing the window and breaking the connection as the androids locked it after the Doctor's previous interruptions.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} new king was {{initially}} met with goodwill from his subjects, {{it was not}} long before certain members of the nobility became disaffected with Gaveston and the special relationship he enjoyed with Edward. On 2 December 1307, exactly one month after Gaveston's marriage, the King organised a tournament in Gaveston's honour at Wallingford Castle. Here Gaveston <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> in arms handed a humiliating defeat to the earls of Warenne, Hereford, and Arundel. Gaveston won, according to various accounts of the events, either by bringing too many knights to the field, or simply by having a better contingent. From this point on Warenne – and possibly also the other two earls – became hostile to Gaveston.|$|E
5|$|Farewell Great Macedon (also {{known as}} Alexander the Great in the script's early stages) was a six-part story pitched for Season 1 and {{was written by}} Moris Farhi. In the story, the Doctor <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> are framed for murder {{as part of a}} {{conspiracy}} to kill Alexander the Great and must pass a number of trials, including walking on hot coals, to gain the trust of his bodyguard Ptolemy. The script was published by Nothing at the End of the Lane in October 2009. It was later adapted by Nigel Robinson for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in November 2010.|$|E
5|$|In December 2000, {{the film}} was {{followed}} by a sequel, , which was broadcast on Japanese television in December 2000 and released worldwide on home video and DVD in 2001.
