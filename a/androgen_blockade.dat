30|$|Within {{the last}} three years two {{alternative}} anti-androgen strategies reached clinical application offering new options in both pre- and post-chemotherapy setting which emphasises the androgen receptor as sustained therapy target in prostate cancer. Chemotherapy often succeeds temporarily following therapy failure of conventional hormone therapies. New drugs including abiraterone acetate (AA) and enzalutamide, effectively target the androgen pathway to arrest aberrant signalling even after multiple therapies. The mode of action of these new compounds is either inhibition of androgen synthesis at the CYP 17 A 1 enzyme covering also adrenal and intracrine androgen sources, or a full <b>androgen</b> receptor (AR) <b>blockade</b> antagonizes the AR function by directly binding this transcription factor with high affinity. Nevertheless, clinical success of these novel drugs is not enduring in all cases. Recent phase 3 trials revealed median time to PSA progression of about eight months for both drugs and in sequential treatments of enzalutamide and AA cross resistances have to be considered (Schrader et al. 2013). Whilst the molecular mechanisms for cross resistances occurring after sequential use of androgen ablation and <b>androgen</b> receptor <b>blockade</b> are still elusive, the alterations leading to individual therapy resistance have been addressed in more detail. The resistance mechanisms can be distinguished between AR amplification/overexpression including alternative AR splice variants (e.g. VCaP) and gain-of-function AR mutations in the ligand binding domain (e.g. LNCaP) associated with anti-androgen treatments notably flutamide or bicalutamide (Knudsen and Penning 2010; Waltering et al. 2012). Even for the second-generation anti-androgen enzalutamide a ligand binding domain mutation has been identified which converts the drug from an AR antagonist to an AR agonist. However, this mutation was identified in a mutagenesis screen in cell models (Balbas et al. 2013).|$|R

We tested whether adding low-dose pioglitazone (Pio; 7. 5 mg/d) confers more benefit. Setting: The {{study was conducted}} at a university hospital. Study Population and Design: This double-blind study enrolled 38 young women with hyperinsulinemic hyperandrogenism [mean body mass index (BMI) 24 kg/m(2) ], all of whom started on Flu (62. 5 mg/d) and Met (850 mg/d) plus a transdermal estroprogestagen, each for 21 of 28 d over 6 months. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive, in addition, placebo (n = 19) or Pio (n = 19; 7. 5 mg/ d) for the same 21 of 28 d over 6 months. Main Outcomes: BMI, waist to hip ratio, hirsutism score, fasting endocrine-metabolic markers, body composition, abdominal fat (visceral vs. sc), and carotid intima-media thickness were measured at study start and after 6 months. Results: PioFluMet reduced intima-media thickness more than Flu-Met and lowered glucose, IGF-I, and C-reactive protein more as well as the ratio of low-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes. PioFluMet treatment was followed by a leaner body composition and a loss of visceral fat (both P < 0. 001). In the total group, the changes included not only decreases in waist to hip ratio, hirsutism score, and testosterone (all P < 0. 001) but also minor drops in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and lactate dehydrogenase (all P < 0. 005), indicating absence of hepatotoxicity; BMI remained unchanged. Clinical side effects were not detected.

We analysed the transcriptional response to bicalutamide treatment with the aim of explaining the inhibition of telomerase in the androgen-sensitive cell line LNCaP and the effects of bicalutamide on the androgen-insensitive cell line DU 145. Cells treated with 80 muM bicalutamide in steroid-depleted medium for 1 day were analysed in duplicate by Affymetrix Human Genome Focus Arrays. Response to bicalutamide in LNCaP cells was represented by downregulation of androgen-regulated genes, activation of the p 53 pathway and inhibition of telomerase, which was associated with downregulation of v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homologue (MYC) and telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit. In DU 145 cells we observed the influence of cell density on bicalutamide effectivity such that highly confluent cells showed lesser sensitivity than low confluent ones. In conclusion, we provide an explanation for telomerase inhibition after <b>androgen</b> receptor <b>blockade</b> in LNCaP cells and we also report activation of the p 53 pathway in LNCaP cells and in-vitro sensitivity to bicalutamide of low confluent androgen-insensitive DU 145 cells.

However, patients with advanced disease clearly have a benefit from androgen deprivation-based treatment for palliating their symptoms and for improving the quality of their lives.

40|$|Divergent {{steroid hormone}} {{profiles}} can shape {{the development of}} male versus female neural phenotypes, but whether they also determine differences in the short-term, neurophysiological patterning of behavior is unknown. We now show that steroid hormone-specific modulation of a vocal pattern generator (VPG) diverges between reproductive morphs in a teleost fish. Only type I male midshipman acoustically court females, whereas type II males steal fertilizations from type I males and, like females, generate only agonistic calls. The androgen 11 -ketotestosterone (11 kT), but not testosterone (T), rapidly (within 5 min) increases type I VPG output. As now shown, T, but not 11 kT, rapidly increases VPG output in type II males and females, consistent with the predominant circulating androgen in type II males and females (T) versus type Is (11 kT). Receptor and enzyme antagonists reveal an unexpected divergence in androgen- versus estrogen-dependent mechanisms in, respectively, type II males versus females. Cortisol, the main circulating glucocorticoid, also has divergent actions: suppressing versus increasing VPG output in, respectively, type II males and females versus type Is. In summary, rapid steroid action on VPG activity is uncoupled from gonadal phenotype (convergent between type II males and females), whereas the receptor-mediated mechanisms of androgen action are predicted by gonadal phenotype (both male morphs are sensitive to <b>androgen</b> receptor <b>blockade,</b> whereas females are not). A comparable mix of neuroendocrine traits may explain the widespread distribution of intrasexual behavioral phenotypes among teleosts and vertebrates in general.

40|$|Abstract: Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the long-term effects}} of treatment with low doses of flutamide on clinical and hormonal parameters, {{as well as on the}} androgen receptor status, in hirsute women. Design: Eighteen hirsute patients with regular menses were studied basally and during treatment with 125 mg flutamide, three times per day for 12 months. Barrier or intrauterine contraception was used during the study in sexually active women. Safety parameters were assessed throughout the study. Hirsutism, graded by the modified Ferriman-Gallwey score, and hormonal parameters were evaluated basally and at 4 -month intervals during treatment. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and ACTH stimulation tests were performed before and after 3 to 4 months of therapy. In addition, the concentration of androgen receptors in mononuclear leukocytes was measured, in both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, basally and after 4 months of flutamide treatment. Results: Flutamide was well tolerated in all women, with the noticeable exception of one patient who presented increased serum transaminase after 8 months of therapy. Hirsutism markedly improved in all women during the treatment (Ferriman-Gallwey score after 1 year: 4. 1 +/- 0. 5 versus 14. 1 +/- 0. 9). A reduction of serum androgens was found, whereas no change was observed in either basal or GnRH-stimulated gonadotropins or in the cortisol and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone response to ACTH. Cycles remained ovulatory. Before treatment, the number of androgen receptors was higher in the luteal than in the follicular phase. This rhythmic differentiation disappeared after the patients had been given the antiandrogen drug. Conclusions: Flutamide is effective in the treatment of hirsutism but requires constant surveillance of liver function. <b>Androgen</b> receptor <b>blockade</b> might be potentiated by a reduction of serum androgens.

We present an immunocytochemical study of the effect of <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade</b> on the expression of HER- 2 and MMP- 2 in bone marrow micrometastasis and the surrounding stromal cells in men with prostate cancer. Methods and Patients. A cross-sectional study of men with prostate cancer. Touch preps were obtained from bone marrow biopsies of men with prostate cancer, before and after radical prostatectomy and during <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade.</b> Micrometastasis detected with anti-PSA immunocytochemistry underwent processing with anti-HER- 2 and anti-MMP- 2 immunocytochemistry. Patients were defined as HER- 2 positive or negative, MMP- 2 negative or an MMP- 2 pattern described as border or central and stromal MMP- 2 defined as positive or negative. The expression of the biomarkers was compared before and after primary treatment and during <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade</b> in relation to the serum PSA at the time of sampling and duration of <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade.</b> Results. 191 men participated, 35 men before surgery and 43 after surgery; {{there were no significant differences}} in HER- 2 expression between groups, there was no MMP- 2 expression centrally or stromal expression of MMP- 2. In men with <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade,</b> HER- 2 expression was significantly higher; there was a trend for increasing HER- 2 expression up to 5 years; central MMP- 2 expression significantly increased after 3 years, while stromal MMP- 2 significantly increased after 6 years. MMP- 2 expression both in micrometastasis and stroma was significantly associated with HER- 2 expression. Expression of MMP- 2 at the border of the micrometastasis was not associated with HER- 2 expression and occurred in the absence of <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade.</b> Conclusions. <b>Androgen</b> <b>blockade</b> decreases serum PSA by eliminating HER- 2 negative prostate cancer cells. However, there is early selection of HER- 2 positive cancer cells which leads to androgen independence and to increased expression of MMP- 2 activity in the micrometastasis. The increased MMP- 2 activity in the micrometastasis increases the expression of MMP- 2 in the surrounding stromal cells and thus could promote angiogenesis and tumor growth resulting in macrometastatic androgen independent disease...|$|E
40|$|Background. Androgen {{deprivation}} {{has been}} in use {{for the treatment of}} advanced prostate cancer since 1941; however, most patients develop resistance to treatment leading to incurable, androgen-independent disease. Previous reports have correlated endothelin A receptor (ETA) expression with increasing prostate cancer grade and stage, and have shown that endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) treatment of ETA-expressing prostate cancer cells inhibits apoptosis. ETA blockade has emerged as a potential strategy in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Here, the potential role of endothelin signaling in promoting prostate cancer cell survival during androgen ablation therapy is evaluated in efforts to establish the potential value of ETA blockade in improving hormone therapy. Methodology and Principle Findings. Androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cells were androgen deprived and evaluated for expression changes in ET- 1, ETA, ETB, and AR. Ligand binding, real time quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemical studies show that androgen deprivation increased ET- 1, ETA, ETB, and AR expression in prostate cancer cell lines, and ETA expression in human prostate tissue. Using the specific AR inhibitor bicalutamide, acute <b>androgen</b> receptor <b>blockade</b> increased prostate cancer cell ET- 1 secretion. Following androgen deprivation, LNCaP cells acquired androgen independence (LNCaP-AI), but retained sensitivity to androgens. ET- 1 treatment of ETA over-expressing prostate cancer cells induced a more rapid and sustained activation of Akt, and ETA blockade significantly reduced Akt activation. In vivo ETA blockade, in combination with castration, significantly reduced LNCaP xenograft cell growth, compared to either treatment alone. Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U 133 Plus 2 expression array analysis of androgen deprived prostate cancer cells discovered dramatic changes in gene expression patterns throughout the transition to androgen independence. Lastly, the role of ETB signaling in prostate cancer cell apoptosis was examined but remains to be further elucidated. Conclusions and Significance. During androgen deprivation, prostate cancer cells up-regulate ET- 1 and ETA expression. Upon engagement of ET- 1, ETA invokes activation of the survival factor Akt. In vivo, ETA blockade plus castration inhibits prostate cancer growth. Collectively, these results implicate endothelin survival signaling in promoting progression to androgen-independent disease, and lend support to the targeted disruption of endothelin survival signaling in treating advanced, metastatic prostate cancer...|$|R

Novel, effective treatment options and more cancer-specific diagnostic tools are urgently needed to facilitate patient management. Here, we explored the construction and application of an array of gene-based molecular imaging and therapeutic vectors {{in a variety of}} clinically relevant settings. These vectors exploit prostate cancer-specific promoters to control the transcription of imaging reporter genes or therapeutic genes, and thus can achieve stringent cancer selectivity. We showed that gene-based imaging vectors can detect prostate cancer metastasis earlier than conventional imaging modalities; we also developed a dual-reporter imaging system that can specifically interrogate the activation/inhibition status of androgen receptor, and thus monitor the efficacy of androgen deprivation and <b>androgen</b> receptor <b>blockade</b> therapies. Further, we explored the applicability of gene-based vectors in detecting circulating tumor cells and have obtained promising results. Moreover, we employed two strategies to improve the clinical usability of viral vectors in immunocompetent hosts (such as humans). In the first strategy, we used a broad-acting immunosuppressant, rapamycin, to reduce the scale of adenovirus-induced inflammatory responses and also to decrease the eliminating effects of host adaptive immune system on viral vectors and viral-infected, transgene-expressing cells. Rapamycin significantly augmented the magnitude and prolonged the duration of virus-delivered transgene expression, and thus enhanced the diagnostic capability of these imaging vectors. The second approach took advantage of the versatile surface modifying ability of non-viral reagents. We designed a polypeptide coating that can non-covalently bind to adenoviral particles and confer protections against blood components such as neutralizing antibodies and coagulation factors. The coating significantly decreased the inhibitory effects of neutralizing antibodies on adenoviral transduction and markedly abrogated coagulation factors-mediated hepatocyte infection. Furthermore, this polypeptide coating reduced the antigenicity of adenoviral vectors in vivo, greatly diminished anti-adenovirus antibody production, and therefore could facilitate repeated administration of viral vectors in immunocompetent hosts. Overall, we herein present a substantial amount of evidence supporting the pre-clinical and translational use of gene-based imaging and therapeutic vectors to assist the management of patients with advanced, treatment-refractory prostate cancer...|$|R

Panax ginseng is known to have various pharmacological activities. Of several products of its root, red ginseng, having many bioactive ginsenosides, is most popularly used in Korea, and recently has been reported to control the proliferation of cancer cells. We here tested the effect of a water extract of Korean red ginseng (WKRG) on testosterone-induced prostate hyperplasia. WKRG (daily intraperitoneal injection) prevented prostate overgrowth and epithelial thickening induced by testosterone in rats, and suppressed a rat prostate kallikrein-S 3. In human prostate cells, WKRG inhibited testosterone-induced cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle by inducing p 21 and p 27, and induced apoptosis. Testosterone-induced expression of human kallikrein- 3 mRNA and activation of androgen receptor (AR) were effectively inhibited by WKRG. Of the major ginsenosides included in WKRG, 20 (S) -Rg 3 was identified to repress AR activity and to attenuate prostate cell growth during testosterone stimulation. Moreover, 20 (S) -Rg 3 downregulated AR by facilitating the degradation of AR protein.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the association of age with the clinicopathological findings, phenotypic expression of circulating prostate cells (CPCs) and micrometastasis, biochemical failure and effect of <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade</b> after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in Chilean men. Methods: This is a prospective, observational, single-center study of Chilean men who underwent radical prostatectomy. Three months after surgery, the peripheral blood was collected to analyze the biochemical failure by measuring prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in the serum. The blood and bone marrow were collected to detect the presence of CPCs and the bone marrow micrometastasis by checking the expression of PSA, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER- 2), and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP- 2) using standard immunocytochemistry. The clinicopathological findings, phenotypic expression of CPCs and micrometastasis, biochemical failure and effect of <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade</b> were analyzed for association with age. Results: In total, 120 / 338 (36. 6 %) of patients were ≥ 70 years (older men). A higher frequency of biochemical failure occurred in older men with negative surgical margins, a Gleason score ≥ 8, and pT 3 tumors compared to patients < 70 years of age (younger men). The expression of HER- 2 and MMP- 2 was higher in CPCs and micrometastasis in older men. After <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade,</b> the expression of HER- 2 and MMP- 2 was similar in both groups. With <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade,</b> more younger men became micrometastasis negative (49 % vs. 15 %) while more older men became castrate resistant (83 % vs. 43 %). Conclusion: After radical prostatectomy, the older men with pathological features of Gleason score ≥ 8, pT 3 tumors, and positive extracapsular extension had higher frequency of biochemical failure and the presence of CPCs. The treatment of <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade</b> was less successful to suppress the disease relapse in the older men than that in the younger man...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} triple <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade</b> {{as an alternative to}} watchful wait-ing, radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy in the management of patients with clinical stage T 1 to T 3 prostate cancer. Methods. The records of 110 consecutive patients were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were treated with a three-drug <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade</b> regimen, consisting of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (leuprolide or goserelin) plus an antiandrogen (flutamide or bicalutamide) plus finasteride (a 5 -alpha-reductase inhibitor), followed by finasteride maintenance therapy, as the sole intervention. All patients refused local therapy and had their prostates intact. Determinants of efficac...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{determined}} how serial {{measurements of}} prostate specific antigen and alkaline phosphatase {{can be used}} to predict survival early in the course of hormone treated metastatic prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was based on a prospective randomized trial of 915 patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma designed to compare parenteral estrogen (polyestradiol phosphate) vs total <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade.</b> We included 697 men who survived at least 6 months and had complete serial measurements of prostate specific antigen and alkaline phosphatase. Six models were constructed based on prostate specific antigen and alkaline phosphatase at start, and after 6 months of treatment, alkaline phosphatase flare and relative prostate specific antigen velocity. We constructed time dependent receiver operating characteristic curves with corresponding area under the curve to predict death from prostate cancer within 3 years. RESULTS: The best variables to predict outcome were alkaline phosphatase at 6 months (AUC 0. 79 for polyestradiol phosphate and 0. 72 for total <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade),</b> alkaline phosphatase at baseline (AUC 0. 70 for polyestradiol phosphate and total <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade)</b> and prostate specific antigen at 6 months (AUC 0. 70 for polyestradiol phosphate and total <b>androgen</b> <b>blockade).</b> Prostate specific antigen and alkaline phosphatase levels 6 months after start of treatment give better prediction of survival than baseline levels. CONCLUSIONS: Alkaline phosphatase at start of treatment and alkaline phosphatase and prostate specific antigen after 6 months {{can be used to}} predict survival of hormone treated metastatic prostate cancer...|$|E
40|$|Munich Wistar Frömter (MWF) rats {{represent}} a valuable animal model {{to investigate the}} development of hypertension and its cardiovascular and renal organ damage, as MWF animals develop mild hypertension and progressive albuminuria. Besides, MWF rats exhibit a sexual dimorphism in kidney damage with a more pronounced degree of albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis in males. A loss of podoplanin expression in podocytes is one possible pathophysiologic mechanism. Furthermore, the MWF strain develops an inborn nephron deficit, which can already be detected at embryonic day (E) 15. 5. In this study microarray gene expression analysis of embryonic rat kidneys was performed to identify candidate genes for the impaired nephron induction in MWF. Specific candidates were further analyzed by reverse transcription-qPCR at E 15. 5 as early-stage kidney, E 19. 0 as late-stage fetal kidney, and in week 4 when nephrogenesis is completed. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used as reference strain after stage-matching at E 16. 0 and E 19. 5, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of testosterone {{on the development of}} albuminuria was investigated in male MWF rats. Adult animals were either orchiectomized (Ox), or orchiectomized and treated with both, testosterone and the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (OxTF), and compared to sham-operated rats (Sham) by measuring the renal albumin excretion. Transcriptome analysis revealed 311 transcripts with significant expression differences between MWF and SHR. Seven genes were located on rat chromosome 6 that was previously linked to the development of albuminuria and nephron deficit in the MWF strain. Four genes were significantly upregulated in MWF (Abcg 5, Ab 1 - 233, Efcab 11, Gpx 2), and three genes were significantly downregulated (Fntb, Lrrn 3, Rtn 1). Gpx 2, encoding the glutathione peroxidase 2, seemed of special interest, as its expression in murine embryonic kidney was already reported. The testosterone study displayed a progressive development of albuminuria in MWF Sham animals with an albumin excretion of 48. 30 ± 6. 16 mg/ 24 h in 18 week old rats. After orchiectomy, albuminuria was reduced by more than 50 % compared with MWF Sham. In OxTF animals testosterone levels were higher after testosterone substitution than in the Sham group. However, <b>androgen</b> receptor <b>blockade</b> with flutamide further suppressed albuminuria to levels of 6. 40 ± 1. 19 mg/ 24 h. Furthermore, a molecular link between angiotensin II stimulation and reduced podoplanin expression was identified in cultured human podocytes. The current study revealed interesting candidates – molecular and hormonal – that could be involved in the pathogenesis of renal damage in the MWF strain. Further investigations are needed to clarify their specific functions and mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Addition of <b>androgen</b> {{receptor}} (AR) <b>blockade</b> (flutamide) to insulin-sensitising therapy (metformin) may confer synergistic {{benefits in}} girls with hyperinsulinaemic androgen excess. We hypothesised that girls with shorter AR gene CAG repeat alleles, and thus greater receptor sensitivity, might benefit {{more from the}} addition of low-dose flutamide. DESIGN: Open randomised crossover study. METHODS: In this study, 32 post-menarcheal girls (mean age 12. 1 years) {{with a history of}} low birth weight and precocious pubarche were subgrouped by CAG genotype ('short': CAG mean length 20, n= 14; 'long': CAG > 20, n= 18). Within each subgroup, girls were 1 : 1 randomised to metformin alone (850 mg/day) or in combination with flutamide (62. 5 mg/day) for 12 months. To allow comparisons with no treatment, long-CAG girls randomised to flutamide-metformin, and short-CAG girls randomised to metformin alone were observed for 12 months before treatment. Body composition by absorptiometry, fasting lipid profiles and levels of insulin, glucose and androgens were measured during the first 12 months on each treatment. RESULTS: In all girls, 12 months flutamide-metformin lowered body fat and improved lipid profiles when compared with no treatment. Compared with metformin alone, flutamide-metformin achieved greater reductions in the percentage of body fat and abdominal fat mass in the short-CAG subgroup (P= 0. 001 to P< 0. 0001). In contrast, in the long-CAG subgroup, flutamide-metformin produced no further improvements when compared with metformin alone. CONCLUSIONS: In young post-menarcheal girls with preclinical androgen excess, low-dose flutamide-metformin improved body composition and key endocrine-metabolic abnormalities. However, only those girls with genetic markers of greater AR sensitivity may benefit from the addition of flutamide above metformin alone. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{prostate}} cancer (PCa) patients, the protein target for <b>androgen</b> deprivation and <b>blockade</b> therapies is <b>androgen</b> receptor (AR). AR interacts with many proteins that function to either co-activate or co-repress its activity. Caveolin- 1 (Cav- 1) is {{not found in}} normal prostatic epithelium, but is found in PCa, and may be an AR co-regulator protein. METHODS We investigated cell line-specific signatures and associations of endogenous AR and Cav- 1 in six PCa cell lines of known androgen sensitivity: LNCaP (androgen sensitive); 22 Rv 1 (androgen responsive); PC 3, DU 145, and ALVA 41 (androgen non-reliant); and RWPE 1 (non-malignant). Protein and mRNA expression profiles were compared and electron microscopy used to identify cells with caveolar structures. For cell lines expressing both AR and Cav- 1, knockdown techniques using small interfering RNA against AR or Cav- 1 were used to test whether diminished expression of one affected the other. Co-sedimentation of AR and Cav- 1 {{was used to test}} their association. A reporter assay for AR genomic activity was utilized following Cav- 1 knockdown. RESULTS AR-expressing LNCaP and 22 Rv 1 cells had low endogenous Cav- 1 mRNA and protein. Cell lines that expressed little or no AR (DU 145, PC 3, ALVA 41, and RWPE 1) expressed high endogenous levels of Cav- 1. AR knockdown in LNCaP cells had little effect on Cav- 1, but Cav- 1 knockdown inhibited AR expression and genomic activity. CONCLUSIONS These data show endogenous AR and Cav- 1 mRNA and protein expression is inversely related in PCa cells, with Cav- 1 acting on the androgen/AR signaling axis possibly as an AR co-activator, demonstrated by diminished AR genomic activity following Cav- 1 knockdown...|$|R
