40|$|Developments in microelectronics, {{micromechanics}} and microelectromechanical systems (e. g. micromotors, microsensors) require {{significant improvements}} in manufacturing tools for mass productions. Especially the assembling tools have to become faster and more precise. Many assembly devices use XY stages driven by DC servomotors with ball screws or parallel structures; others use linear drives with traditional ball bearings. Only a few devices use linear drives together with air bearings, but always together with an <b>angular</b> <b>guide</b> for X and Y direction. The novel approach {{presented in this paper}} is based on linear drives together with a planar air bearing. In contrast to other stages, it doesn't need any <b>angular</b> <b>guide.</b> This reduces the moved mass and leads to higher accelerations. It consists of an arrangement of four identical moving-coils attached to a slide, which is suspended by a planar air bearing. This new configuration allows a workspace of 60 x 60 mm² and an acceleration exceeding 10 g 1 with a resolution better than 100 nm. This paper gives an overview of the system, describes the design of the moving-coils and shows first experimental results of the controller...|$|E

To unlock, the barrel is cammed down by {{the interaction of the}} shaped cam on the barrel and the <b>angular</b> camming <b>guide</b> in the frame.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a spinning charge coupled to the Maxwell field. Through the appropriate symmetry {{in the initial}} conditions the charge remains at rest. We establish that any time-dependent finite energy solution converges to a sum of a soliton wave and an outgoing free wave. The convergence holds in global energy norm. Under a small constant external magnetic field the soliton manifold is stable in local energy seminorms {{and the evolution of}} the <b>angular</b> velocity is <b>guided</b> by an effective finite-dimensional dynamics. The proof uses a non-autonomous integral inequality method...|$|R
50|$|In graphic design, a grid is a {{structure}} (usually two-dimensional) {{made up of}} a series of intersecting straight (vertical,horizontal, and <b>angular)</b> or curved <b>guide</b> lines used to structure content. The grid serves as an armature or framework on which a designer can organize graphic elements (images, glyphs, paragraphs, etc.) in a rational, easy-to-absorb manner. A grid can be used to organize graphic elements in relation to a page, in relation to other graphic elements on the page, or relation {{to other parts of the}} same graphic element or shape.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we present}} our study on {{evaluating}} electro-optic properties of Ba 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 TiO 3 thin films by prism coupling technique. Ferroelectric Ba 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 TiO 3 thin films were epitaxially deposited on LaNiO 3 electroded MgO (001) single-crystal substrates using pulsed laser deposition. Refractive indices and {{thickness of the}} Ba 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 TiO 3 thin film were determined with a rutile prism (Metricon 200 -P- 2) under zero electric field at a wavelength of 632. 8 nm. The <b>angular</b> shift of <b>guided</b> mode was observed subsequently with a conductive prism (Metricon 200 -P- 4 aC) when electric field {{was applied to the}} thin film sample. The ordinary refractive index no changes 2. 2 % under a dc voltage of 4 V (E ∼ 11 V/μm). The linear electro-optic coefficient tensor r 13 is thus calculated to be about 780 pm/V, showing the excellent potential of Ba 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 TiO 3 thin films for use in active optical devices.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} treatment of higher-order modes of vacuum-clad ultrathin optical fibers. We show that, {{for a given}} fiber, the higher-order modes have larger penetration lengths, larger effective mode radii, and larger fractional powers outside the fiber than the fundamental mode. We calculate, both analytically and numerically, the Poynting vector, propagating power, energy, angular momentum, and helicity (or chirality) of the guided light. The axial and azimuthal components of the Poynting vector can be negative {{with respect to the}} direction of propagation and the direction of phase circulation, respectively, depending on the position, the mode type, and the fiber parameters. The orbital and spin parts of the Poynting vector may also have opposite signs in some regions of space. We show that the angular momentum per photon decreases with increasing fiber radius and increases with increasing azimuthal mode order. The orbital part of <b>angular</b> momentum of <b>guided</b> light depends not only on the phase gradient but also on the field polarization, and is positive with respect to the direction of the phase circulation axis. Meanwhile, depending on the mode type, the spin and surface parts of angular momentum and the helicity of the field can be negative with respect to the direction of the phase circulation axis.

40|$|Gestalt (1964) {{have been}} widely used by psychologists, {{remedial}} reading specialists, and occupational therapists. As the Frostig and Bender are both paper and pencil tests of visual-perceptual and visual-motor development, often a tester must choose between the two tests. This paper will compare the usefulness of the Frostig and the Bender in assessing reading readiness. The Frostig is a group-administered test consisting of five subtests, each purportedly measuring a different visual-perceptual or visualmotor skill. Subtest I, Eye-Motor Coordination, involves the drawing of continuous straight, curved or <b>angular</b> lines between <b>gUide</b> lines of various Widths, or from target to target without guides. Subtest II, Figure-Ground Relationships, involves the perception and outlining of figures against increasingly complex grounds. Subtest III, Constancy of Shape, requires the child to outline circles and squares in rotated positions, sometimes enclosed in a complex ground. Subtest IV, Position in Space, involves discrimination of reversals and rotation of figQres presented in a series. The child is asked to mark the figures which are the same or different from the model or from other figures in a row. 1 Support for this research was provided by the Office of Education Contract OEc- 4 - 6 -o 61493 - 2089. 1 Subtest V, Spatial Relations, involves the analysis of simple forms and patterns. These forms consist of lines of various lengths and angles which the child is required to copy using dots as guides. The Frostig yields a raw score, a perceptual-age score and a scaled score for each of the five subtests. The test also yields a Perceptual Quotient, a deviation measure obtained from the sum of the subtest scale scores after correction for age variation. The data in this paper are derived from perceptual age scores for the subtests and the Perceptua...|$|R
