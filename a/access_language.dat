40|$|Since the 1960 s, the United States {{government}} has paid increasing {{attention to the}} rights of language minorities and to the need for greater civic and political integration of these groups. With the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the issuance of Executive Orders, and intervention by the federal judiciary, {{progress has been made in}} the realm of <b>language</b> <b>access.</b> State and local courts have likewise taken steps (albeit imperfectly) to provide interpretation and translation assistance to Limited English Proficient persons. Most recently, responding to both lack of services and inconsistent practices, the American Bar Association has set out national guidelines on the subject. As <b>language</b> <b>access</b> rises in importance – within the government as a whole, and the legal system in particular – law schools have begun to develop strategies to promote <b>language</b> <b>access</b> within the academy. These strategies serve multiple purposes: to prepare students to identify, and respond to, issues of language difference in the context of legal work; to ensure that the policies and practices of law schools comply with <b>language</b> <b>access</b> norms; and to foment student awareness and advocacy on <b>language</b> <b>access,</b> as a key social justice issue. Indeed, educating future lawyers involves not just teaching law students how to read a case, interview a client or draft a brief, it also includes introducing them to the numerous ways lawyers seek to participate in and improve the justice system. Promoting <b>language</b> <b>access</b> in the legal academy offers numerous opportunities to expose students to a diverse set of organizations and skills, and to a community of advocates who have engaged on these issues.

30|$|Limited {{language}} proficiency among migrants {{has been shown}} to limit migrants from various aspects of everyday life, from the labor market to government services. In the USA, <b>language</b> <b>access</b> laws have been enacted to help provide Limited English Proficient (LEP) individuals and households access to public benefits. The most extensive efforts in <b>language</b> <b>access</b> are in health care, with numerous states requiring Medicaid agencies to provide interpreters or translated documents. In this paper, I take advantage of heterogeneity in state-level <b>language</b> <b>access</b> laws to examine whether these efforts do indeed increase Medicaid take-up rates. I find that <b>language</b> <b>access</b> improves Medicaid take-up rates among LEP migrants without crowding out private health insurance; in fact, private health insurance coverage improves with the enactment of <b>language</b> <b>access</b> laws. There is some variation in efficacy across states, with some evidence that California and New York are the main drivers of the increased take-up rates. Lastly, I find that even though many of the <b>language</b> <b>access</b> laws primarily target Spanish speakers, the laws might not be as helpful to Spanish-speaking migrants.|$|R

Client software, including DAM, could send queries in DAL's standard language which would then be translated and executed regardless of the back-end database.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two most}} {{prominent}} theories on lexical <b>access</b> for bilinguals, <b>Language</b> Selective <b>Access</b> and <b>Language</b> Non-Selective <b>Access,</b> {{attempt to explain}} the process and stages of lexical activation and selection. These hypotheses focus on determining whether lexical candidates from different languages that share similar lexical features are activated when a word is presented. For instance, when the Dutch word vork is activated, is the English word pork also activated? If the answer is [...] "no", it might suggest that language selection happens before the recognition of a word and only the lexical information of the target language is selectively activated, in which case lexical <b>access</b> is <b>language</b> selective. If the answer is [...] "yes", it might suggest the other possibility that the recognition of a word is processed in parallel for both languages and the lexical information of both languages are activated, in which case lexical <b>access</b> is <b>language</b> non-selective.

30|$|In this paper, I {{make use}} of the {{heterogeneity}} in state <b>language</b> <b>access</b> laws to examine if Medicaid take-up rates among LEP migrants increased after the enactment of <b>language</b> <b>access</b> laws using a difference-in-difference model. I find that <b>language</b> <b>access</b> laws increase Medicaid take-up rates by 1.8 percentage points. This increase to government-funded health insurance has not {{come at the expense of}} private health insurance. In fact, quite the opposite has happened, with private health insurance coverage increasing after <b>language</b> <b>access</b> laws are enacted. The increase in Medicaid take-up rates varies by state, and California and New York appear to be major drivers of the increase in Medicaid take-up rates. Lastly, there is no evidence that Spanish speakers are benefiting from the laws more so than other LEP migrants, even though many of these laws are targeted at providing translation services to Spanish speakers; Spanish-speaking LEP migrants do not have higher take-up rates after the <b>language</b> <b>access</b> law was enacted compared to other LEP migrants.|$|R
30|$|To {{combat the}} limited {{knowledge}} {{and enforcement of}} Title VI, all states have passed some degree of <b>language</b> <b>access</b> laws {{in the health care}} industry. The amount of <b>language</b> <b>access</b> varies greatly across states, however. Some states have enacted comprehensive Title VI-like laws for state agencies, while some states merely require information pamphlets on a variety of diseases be translated. Provisions also include rules on interpreter certification and facility licensure, access plans, and rights at hearings. To see if <b>language</b> <b>access</b> plays a role in the goal of extending health insurance coverage, I take advantage of the heterogeneity in state-level <b>language</b> <b>access</b> laws to analyze whether <b>language</b> <b>access</b> laws requiring translation services at Medicaid agencies increases Medicaid take-up rates for LEP migrants. Due to the similarities between the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and Medicaid 1, “Medicaid” from now on means non-Medicare, non-military public health insurance. To my knowledge, this is the first paper to look into the effects of <b>language</b> <b>access</b> on access to government services. This is also the first paper to examine individual outcomes from language access/barriers in health care using public use microdata. My main result is that <b>language</b> <b>access</b> improves Medicaid take-up rates among LEP migrants. What is more, {{there is no evidence of}} government crowd-out; private health insurance coverage even increases after the passage of <b>language</b> <b>access</b> laws. The effect of the different state laws varies across states, and the main results could be driven by New York and California. Furthermore, even though many of these translation services primarily target Spanish speakers, the results suggest that the laws are not more helpful to Spanish-speaking migrants.|$|R
50|$|As {{in other}} Latin American countries, in Chile, from {{the onset of}} Spanish {{colonization}} and settlement, miscegenation or mestizaje was the norm rather than the exception. Today, ethnic and racial self-identities are highly fluid and can differ between persons of the same family, including siblings of the same parentage. It is dictated not only by strict physical appearance, nor more loosely by ancestry (actual or presumed), but by cultural patterns, social class, wealth and <b>access,</b> <b>language,</b> and prevailing biases of the era. These very factors, indeed, lend to the significantly varying ethnic structure figures from one source to the next. Additionally, those various figures refer to different, even if often overlapping, concepts: including racial vs ethnic categories, self-identity vs genetic findings, as well as culturally assigned categories. These concepts should not be confused, and the figures represented in one source might not be corresponding to figures of concepts from another source.|$|E
50|$|Self <b>access</b> <b>language</b> {{learning}} {{centers are}} educational facilities designed for student learning {{that is at}} least partially, if not fully self-directed.

These centers exist primarily in Asia, Europe and North America. Use of such facilities and the pedagogical theory they are based upon has its advantages and disadvantages. Proper use {{can result in a}} feeling of empowerment and better learning outcomes, but {{getting to the point where}} students and teachers can exploit them effectively can be problematic.
