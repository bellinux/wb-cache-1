5|$|South <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> played four {{different}} sides in women's Test cricket, with England their most frequent opponent, having faced them in six Tests. The only side that South <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> beaten in Test cricket are the Netherlands, who South <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> played once, in 2007. South <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> similarly faced England {{more times than}} any other team in women's One Day International cricket, playing 33 matches. As such, England have recorded the most victories against South Africa, beating them 25 times. South <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> beaten Pakistan more times than any other country, triumphing on twelve occasions against them. In women's T20Is, South <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> as well played England the most, and lost to them on thirteen occasions. South <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> recorded the most victories against Ireland, beating them in nine of their meetings.|$|E
5|$|In its 2008 report, Reporters Without Borders {{ranked the}} Zimbabwean media as 151st out of 173. The {{government}} also bans many foreign broadcasting stations from Zimbabwe, including the CBC, Sky News, Channel 4, American Broadcasting Company, Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), and Fox News.

5|$|Boletus aereus, {{the dark}} cep or bronze bolete, {{is a highly}} prized and much sought-after edible {{mushroom}} in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is widely consumed in Spain (Basque Country and Navarre), France, Italy, Greece, and generally throughout the Mediterranean. Described as a new species in 1789 by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard, it {{is closely related to}} several other European boletes, including B.reticulatus, B.pinophilus, and the popular B.edulis. Some populations in North <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> been classified as a separate species, B.mamorensis, although they are phylogenetically very close.|$|E

40|$|Since the verifi cation of the {{termination}} of its nuclear weapons programme and the dismantling of its nuclear devices and facilities, South <b>Africa</b> <b>has</b> succeeded in converting its defensive nuclear posture to the employment of nuclear energy for peaceful uses, such as power generation and nuclear medicine. In respect of the latter, South <b>Africa</b> <b>has</b> skilfully crafted a global niche for itself. Building on its nuclear expertise, South <b>Africa</b> <b>has</b> {{become one of the}} world’s leading producers of medical isotopes – an under-researched area in South Africa’s nuclear and economic diplomacy – which are used in a variety of medical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Moreover, South <b>Africa</b> <b>has</b> succeeded in producing these isotopes from low-enriched, rather than highly enriched uranium; adding further credence to its nuclear non-proliferation commitments. By converting its nuclear reactor, SAFARI- 1, to produce and supply medical isotopes, South <b>Africa</b> <b>has</b> gained numerous material and non-material gains, ranging from foreign exchange to status and prestige.

5|$|By 2016, the Olympic Games {{will have}} been hosted by 44 cities in 23 countries, but by cities outside Europe and North America on only eight occasions. Since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, the Olympics have been held in Asia or Oceania four times, a sharp {{increase}} compared to the previous 92years of modern Olympic history. The 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro were the first Olympics for a South American country. No bids from countries in <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> succeeded.|$|E
5|$|Ecotourism setups {{are being}} used to {{generate}} public interest in charismatic animals such as the jaguar, {{while at the same time}} generating revenue that can be used in conservation efforts. Audits done in <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> shown that ecotourism has helped in African cat conservation. As with large African cats, a key concern in jaguar ecotourism is the considerable habitat space the species requires, so if ecotourism is used to aid in jaguar conservation, some considerations need to be made as to how existing ecosystems will be kept intact, or how new ecosystems that are large enough to support a growing jaguar population will be put into place.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand are {{the most}} {{successful}} team {{in the history of}} the tournament, with three wins. They are also the only team to have won consecutive tournaments, with their victories in the 2011 and 2015 Rugby World Cup. Australia and South <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> won the competition twice, while England have one win. They are the only nation from the northern hemisphere to have won the competition. France are the only team to appear in a final without winning, losing all three finals they have contested.|$|E

5|$|The plumage of {{the family}} is {{generally}} very bright and in most species is mostly or at least partly green, although the two carmine bee-eaters are mostly rose-coloured. Most of the Merops bee-eaters have a black bar through the eye and many have differently coloured throats and faces. The extent of the green in these species varies from almost complete in the green bee-eater to barely any green in the white-throated bee-eater. Three species, from equatorial <b>Africa,</b> <b>have</b> no green at all in their plumage, the black bee-eater, the blue-headed bee-eater and the rosy bee-eater. Many species have elongated central tail feathers.|$|E
5|$|Various {{regions of}} <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> folkloric tales of beings with vampiric abilities: in West Africa the Ashanti people tell of the iron-toothed and tree-dwelling asanbosam, and the Ewe {{people of the}} adze, which can {{take the form of}} a firefly and hunts children. The Eastern Cape region of South Africa has the impundulu, which can {{take the form of a}} large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning, and the Betsileo people of Madagascar tell of the ramanga, an outlaw or living vampire who drinks the blood and eats the nail {{clippings}} of nobles.|$|E
5|$|A carnivore, the caracal {{typically}} preys upon small mammals, {{birds and}} rodents. Studies in South <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> {{reported that it}} preys on the Cape grysbok, the common duiker, sheep, goats, bush vlei rats, rock hyraxes, hare and birds. A study in western India showed that rodents comprise {{a significant portion of}} the diet. They will feed from a variety of sources, but tend to focus on the most abundant one. Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites. Larger antelopes such as young kudu, bushbuck, impala, mountain reedbuck and springbok may also be targeted. Mammals generally comprise at least 80 percent of the diet. Lizards, snakes and insects are infrequently eaten. They are notorious for attacking livestock, but rarely attack humans.|$|E

5|$|Endemic to South Africa, the bluebuck was {{confined}} to the southwestern Cape. A 2003 study estimated the expanse of the historic range of the bluebuck at , mainly along the southern coast of South Africa; fossils, however, have been discovered in a broader area that includes the southern and western CFR and even the highlands of Lesotho. Historical records give a rough estimate of its range. On 20January 1774, Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg recorded a sighting in Tigerhoek, Mpumalanga. In March or April 1783, Levalliant claimed to have witnessed two specimens in Soetemelksvlei, Western Cape. Based on these notes, a 2009 study by the South African zoologist Graham I. H. Kerley and colleagues estimated {{the range of the}} bluebuck to be limited within a triangular area in the Western Cape, bounded by Caledon to the west, Swellendam to the northeast and Bredasdorp to the south. Rock paintings in the Caledon river valley of the Free State province in eastern South <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> been identified as bluebucks, which also confirms the once wider distribution of the species.|$|E
5|$|In total, South <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> played 170 ODIs. Mignon du Preez is {{the most}} capped player, having {{appeared}} in 106 ODIs and the leading run-scorer with 2,767 runs, although her batting average is lower than a number of her compatriots. One of these players, Johmari Logtenberg, ended her career {{with an average of}} 38.54. Her total of 153 not out against the Netherlands in 2007 is the highest score in women ODI cricket by a South African, and the 13th-highest overall. Du Preez, Logtenberg and Laura Wolvaardt jointly hold the record for the most centuries scored by a South African woman with two. Dane van Niekerk has claimed more ODI wickets than any other South African women, having taken 120. Shabnim Ismail has the best return by a South African bowler, having claimed six wickets in an innings in a Women's World Cup qualifying match against the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Sites in <b>Africa</b> <b>have</b> {{been marked}} as such {{for a variety}} of reasons, such as {{deforestation}} and hunting, civil war, threats to and hostage taking of reserve staff, oil and gas projects and mining, declines in biodiversity, and structural damage to buildings. Three sites were formerly declared as being in danger, but have since lost the status: the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (19841989), the Rwenzori Mountains National Park (19992004), and Tipasa (20022006). The Garamba National Park and Timbuktu have also lost their statuses in 1992 and 2005, respectively, but later regained it in 1996 and 2012. Despite its large number of endangered sites and the circumstances surrounding them, African World Heritage Sites have never been stripped of their title, something that has only occurred twice.|$|E

In 2009, South Africa {{were one of}} eight teams which competed in the inaugural ICC Women's World Twenty20 held in England, but failed to progress beyond the group stage. They played their first home match during the 2009–10 season, hosting West Indies for three matches {{as part of a}} larger tour. South Africa's first victory in Twenty20 International cricket came against Ireland in August 2008. Mignon du Preez is South Africa's all-time leading run-scorer with 1166 runs. Shandre Fritz is the only South African women to have scored a century in a Twenty20 International, scoring the second highest total in any women's Twenty20 International with a score of 116 not out against the Netherlands. Shabnim Ismail is South Africa's leading wicket-taker with 58 wickets.|$|E
