He said to me, 'We're going to do the Wacken thing, but let's just wait until the winter tour is over and then you and me we're going to sit down in January and discuss what we're going to do.'" [...] Oliva also said that Savatage has [...] "already gotten offers" [...] to play in [...] "certain areas of the world, America being one, Greece, South America, places like that", and added that he does not rule out the possibility of any more shows. Though Oliva said he does not know what the future holds for Savatage, he said, [...] "I just wish that everything works out good and then we'll see what happens down the road.

50|$|That is {{basically}} how the theory works, a much thornier problem {{is exactly what}} the theory is for. Some commentators, like Michael Loux, have suggested that the theory of ascent and descent to particulars is intended to provide truth conditions for the quantifiers. T. K.

5000|$|Let me {{tell you}} a little story behind the song [...] "Ten Years Gone" [...] on our new album. I was working my ass off before joining Zeppelin.

40|$|Today, we {{are facing}} the decline of {{institutional}} religion. In Finland, the decrease in membership of the mainstream Evangelical Lutheran Church has been unusually rapid {{over the past few}} years, but, at the same time, the variety of religious supply has significantly increased. In addition to non-Christian spiritual and religious alternatives, innumerable lay movements, functions and practices are also offering their services within the Christian field, both in non-denominational circles and in those more or less linked to the mainstream church. The changes that occur in the religious field in Finland take place largely within the Christian cultural field. In addition to the obvious organisational changes taking place in the religious landscape of Finland, there is a certain fragmentation of contemporary religious attitudes. Such changes have been identified throughout the Western world—conventional definitions of ‘believing’ and ‘belonging’ do not seem to fit <b>anything</b> properly <b>anymore.</b> Furthermore, ‘practising’ and ‘participating’ as dynamic aspects of religiosity make the general view even more nuanced. An example of religious involvement within this frame is a Christian intercessory prayer service called the Healing Rooms. It is a religious practice that is attempting to accommodate the contemporary situation of post-secular Finland, and simultaneously advocating its traditional mission of evangelicism. ...|$|R

50|$|What TDS does is, {{instead of}} asking someone else if it has the solution, is appending the problem to someone else's job queue. In other words, every time a {{computer}} has a board position for which it wants a solution, it simply sends it over the network to the responsible computer and does not worry about it anymore. Only if a problem falls within its own authority range will a computer try to look up {{if it has a}} solution stored in its own table. If not, it simply appends it to its own queue. If it does have a solution, it does not have to compute <b>anything</b> <b>anymore</b> and fetches a new job from the queue.|$|E
50|$|What {{makes the}} big {{difference}} between traditional transposition based problem solving and TDS is that asking some computer if it has solved a problem follows a request-response approach, in which the computer asking the other computer has {{to wait for a}} response. In TDS, forwarding a job to another computer does not involve any waiting, because you know (by design) that the other computer will accept the job and try to solve it. This means that latency (the main cause of delays in request-response models) is not an issue, because a computer simply never waits for an answer to come back. The hardware or operating system can guarantee that the message arrives at its destination so the program does {{not have to worry about}} <b>anything</b> <b>anymore</b> after it forwards the job.|$|E

The other three, Marines Rene Gagnon and Ira Hayes, and Navy corpsman John Bradley who while recovering in the hospital from shrapnel wounds was told incorrectly {{that he was in}} the photograph, arrived in Washington in April. Gagnon and then Bradley, incorrectly identified Hansen as being in the photo. When Hayes was interviewed after them about the identities of the flag-raisers in the photo by the same Marine lieutenant colonel, Hayes said Block was in Hansen's position. Hayes was then told the identities were made public and were not going to be changed and not to say <b>anything</b> about it <b>anymore</b> (the colonel later said Hayes said Hansen was in the photo). Strank, Block, Soulsey, and Hayes were in the same rifle squad in Second platoon while Bradley was in Third Platoon and Gangon was an Easy Company's runner (messenger).|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Davis {{became the}} second woman to free climb El Capitan in one day. One year later, in October 2005, {{she became the}} first woman to free climb the Salathé Wall, on El Capitan, The route is rated 5.13b/c, is 35 pitches, and {{approximately}} [...] long. The difficulty of the climb can be described as [...] "spidering up the side of a skyscraper, climbing to [...] no bigger than lentils". What makes Davis' achievement even more impressive is that she free climbed the route, meaning that she used only her hands and feet to climb the rock; she did not hang off the rope or any other mechanical aids. Davis worked on the route throughout September, learning every inch of the climb and meeting Cybele Blood, who became her belayer. Davis had initially planned for the climb to take five days and had cached water and food along the route for that length of the time, but poor weather, high numbers of climbers on the route and difficult climbing made the climb take eleven days. In fact, Davis wore only light climbing shoes, climbing tights, long underwear, and a light wind jacket. The only other gear she had was climbing gear, a lightweight sleeping bag, a portable espresso maker, water and food. When the two ran low on food and water, Blood went looking for the cached supplies but couldn't find them, so Davis [...] "jugged" [...] to the top to get some water and then returned to the route to continue the free climb. This climb was Davis' [...] "dream come true" [...] and afterwards she said [...] "I don't have to prove <b>anything</b> to myself <b>anymore,</b> or to anyone else." ...|$|R
