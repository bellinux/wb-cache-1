2500|$|David Cameron, {{the then}} new Conservative prime minister, said the murders were a [...] "terrible shock". He said the {{decriminalisation}} of prostitution should be [...] "looked at again", {{but he also}} added that: [...] "I don't think we should jump to conclusions on this – there <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> of problems that decriminalisation would bring." [...] Later, aides close to Cameron strongly insisted he was not suggesting prostitution should be legalised and was more concerned with addressing the social problems surrounding it such as encouraging agencies {{to work together to}} help women off the streets or to combat drug addiction. Cameron has also called for tougher action on kerb-crawling and drug abuse.|$|E
2500|$|Game Revolution's Joe Dodson {{scored the}} game a C, arguing {{the mixing of}} {{gameplay}} styles was [...] poorly executed; [...] "Most games include stealth and action mechanics so that the player can choose how to approach a situation, but in Shadow of Rome, Octavianus cannot fight at all and Agrippa is about as stealthy as a hippo on PCP." [...] He also [...] found the combat system shallow; [...] "Agrippa's gameplay heavily relies on the X button. There <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> of special names for the crazy stuff he can do, {{but most of it}} requires one button press." [...] He concluded, [...] "despite its grandiose subject matter, Shadow of Rome is merely a bad stealth game chained to a limited action game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{orthodox}} Marxists or economists {{inspired by}} Marx (including Karl Kautsky, Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky, Nikolai Bukharin, Rudolf Hilferding, Rosa Luxemburg, Vladimir Lenin, Otto Bauer, Fritz Sternberg, Natalia Moszkowska, Paul Sweezy, Kozo Uno and Makoto Itoh) provided alternative crisis theories, focusing variously on the anarchy of capitalist production, sectoral disproportions, underconsumption and realization problems, labor-shortage and population pressures, credit insufficiency, excess capital and wages squeezing profits. According to Professor Costas Lapavitsas, [...] "both Hilferding and Lenin – indeed {{most of the}} leading Marxists of their time – treated crises as complex and multifaceted phenomena {{that could not be}} reduced to a simple theory of the rate of profit to fall. The notion that the normal state of capitalist production is to malfunction due to a persistently excessive organic composition of capital, or even due to falling 'surplus' absorption, would have been alien to classical Marxists." [...] Implicitly or explicitly, it was argued by these Marxist economists that economic crises, although they are a fairly regular occurrence in the last two centuries of capitalist development, do not all have exactly the same causes. There <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> of things that can go wrong with capitalism, throwing the markets out of kilter.|$|E

2500|$|Matthew Horton {{writing for}} Virgin Media praised Lewis for experimenting with dubstep on [...] "Come Alive" [...] and bubblegum pop on [...] "Shake You Up," [...] {{describing}} both songs as experiments that work. Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian newspaper {{picked up on}} the album's composition and described it as too heavily reliant on ballads, saying the issue was that it was [...] "an area where Adele now has the advantage." [...] However Sullivan did say that [...] "for once Lewis has made an album that's worth turning up – in parts, at least." [...] She praised [...] "Come Alive", [...] "Glassheart" [...] and [...] "Trouble". Fraser McAlpine from BBC Music gave the album a mixed review saying that Glassheart [...] "largely plays up to expectations". He criticised the subject matter, noting that many of the songs revisit familiar territory on how [...] "she is always unlucky in love, unless she is swooning in melancholy bliss." [...] McAlpine praised the production values, noting that [...] "over the course of these 12 songs there <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> of production nods to happier music" [...] but also pointing out that on most songs [...] " [...] sounds devastated." [...] In part [...] "its her natural tone of voice," [...] McAlpine concluded, as well as noting that there were not really any up-tempo songs, just songs that weren't ballads, but adding that it didn't matter as [...] "the songs that tend to fly best, on their own terms at least, are the uncluttered muscle ballads." [...] Commenting on [...] "Come Alive", he stated that although the [...] "breakbeat" [...] production is one of the [...] "happier" [...] ones on the album, Lewis sounds [...] "eternally downcast". The Independents Hugh Montgomery gave the album a mixed review, saying that [...] "obviously there's still swathes of antiseptic balladry best described as 'music to fold towels by'." [...] However, not all of his review was negative. Montgomery said the album attempted to make Lewis [...] "current again" [...] by including songs penned by Sandé, a [...] "Bond theme manqué" [...] and [...] "obviously and actually rather effectively, some dubstep." [...] Critics Robert Copsey and Lewis Corner from Digital Spy put Glassheart at number nine in their Top 20 albums of 2012, Copsey and Corner said that despite being renowned for ballads, [...] "it's the pacey numbers full of angst and torment that stand out." [...] Later in a poll of 25,000people, conducted by Digital Spy, readers voted Glassheart the fifth best album of 2012 with 9.8% share of the vote, behind Sandé's Our Version of Events, Babel by Mumford and Sons, Lana Del Rey's Born to Die and Fall to Grace by Paloma Faith.|$|E
