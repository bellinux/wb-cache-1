To guarantee this process robustness with acceptable dimensional accuracy and surface quality, the stone dynamic effects in continuous balanced contact with the workpiece have to studied deeply. This paper highlights these effects on honed surface textures. The stone dynamic behavior was studied at conventional regime ranged from 0, 5 g to 1, 5 g as often used in mass production. In this range, the dimensional accuracy is ensured by opposition to the surface appearance. However, higher accelerations up to 2, 5 g improve simultaneously the form quality (especially straightness) and reduces the cycle time.

5000|$|In prehistoric Japan, ground {{stone tools}} appear during the Japanese Paleolithic period, that lasted from around 40,000 BC to 14,000 BC. [...] Elsewhere, ground stone tools became {{important}} during the Neolithic period beginning about 10,000 BC. These ground or polished implements are manufactured from larger-grained {{materials such as}} basalt, jade and jadeite, greenstone and some forms of rhyolite which are not suitable for flaking. The greenstone industry was important in the English Lake District, and {{is known as the}} Langdale axe industry. Ground stone implements included adzes, celts, and axes, which were manufactured using a labour-intensive, time-consuming method of repeated grinding against an <b>abrasive</b> <b>stone,</b> often using water as a lubricant. Because of their coarse surfaces, some ground stone tools were used for grinding plant foods and were polished not just by intentional shaping, but also by use. Manos are hand stones used in conjunction with metates for grinding corn or grain. Polishing increased the intrinsic mechanical strength of the axe. Polished stone axes were important for the widespread clearance of woods and forest during the Neolithic period, when crop and livestock farming developed on a large scale. They are distributed very widely and were traded over great distances since the best rock types were often very local. They also became venerated objects, and were frequently buried in long barrows or round barrows with their former owners.|$|E

Each group was classified into four subgroups: being polished with <b>abrasive</b> <b>stone,</b> bur for acrylic, silicone polisher and without being polished as control group.

The surface roughness of polymerized acrylic with and without pressure and polished with different technique was analyzed using One-Way ANOVA, continued by Dunnet test.

The result showed that pressure and polishing technique affected surface roughness significantly (p = 0. 001).

40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} process of <b>abrasive</b> <b>stones</b> with cubic boron nitride (CBN) as abrasive and metallic binder, some differences were observed regarding abrasive density at different heights of the <b>stones.</b> If <b>abrasive</b> density is too low, honing stones do not cut the material properly. Honing stones are obtained by means of sintering processes. Previously, a humectant material is added to abrasive grains, and then they are mixed with metallic binder. Humectant is used to assure covering of each abrasive grain with binder. In the present work, along {{the manufacturing}} process of honing stones, quality of the mixing process of components was assessed by means of two different parameters: covering degree of grains by binder (CD) and homogeneity degree (HD) of the mix before sintering process. Both parameters are calculated by means of weight measurement in the mixing step. Different quantities of humectant and different mixing times were taken into account. A higher quantity of humectant implies a higher covering degree, leading to more homogeneous honing stones. For this reason, highest quantity of humectant is recommended within the range studied. However, a certain mixing time is required to assure homogeneity of the mix prior to sintering. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the cutting}} {{characteristics}} of super abrasive stones using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser are studied. The {{influence of the}} heat on the stone surface cut by laser is investigated. As work materials, CBN stones and diamond stones with grain size of # 2000 are used. As a result, the super <b>abrasive</b> <b>stone</b> of 3 mm in thickness can be cut with the molten width of 0. 2 mm in maximum and with no chipping at the edge. The cutting speed of laser beam is 2. 6 times faster than that of diamond blade {{in the case of}} CBN stone and 24 times faster in the case of diamond stone. There remains a heat affected zone (HAZ) in the stone surface and its thickness is about 0. 02 mm. In the HAZ, the abrasive grains are oxidized and their crystal structures are changed by the heat of laser irradiation. However, the HAZ raises the absorption of the laser beam at the stone surface and raises the strength of the stone a little because the pores in the HAZ are closed by the re-solidified vitrified bond. Therefore, laser cutting is useful for the manufacturing of the super abrasive stones in productivity and quality. 超砥粒砥石の生産性向上を目標として, パルスNd : YAGレーザを用いた超砥粒砥石の切断に関する研究が行われている. 厚み 3 mmのCBN砥石およびダイヤモンド砥石を用いて切断実験した結果, ダイヤモンドブレードによる切断と比較して取り代および切断速度が改善され, 切断面の熱変質層には熱亀裂が存在せず, 良好な加工が可能なことを示した...|$|E

The form quality, the roughness and the surface appearance manufactured by honing determine the friction of the piston in the liner. The process is however mechanically complex and the selection of the process parameters is currently based on empirical methods. The aim of this paper is thus to develop a macroscopic simulation environment which will help end-users during this setting-up stage. The development of this virtual tool is based on a space-time discretization and a macroscopic cutting model taking into account local contacts between the workpiece and the <b>abrasive</b> <b>stones.</b> The space-time discretization allows representing the machine environment including the tool, the workpiece and the machine kinematics. The cutting model allows converting kinematics and abrasive contacts in dynamic data and material removal rate by calculation. The cutting model is initially adjusted based on simple experiments.

Results are validated by comparison with industrial context experiments. The simulation of the whole honing cycle allows predicting the form quality, one of the roughness criteria and the surface appearance. Moreover, simulation results are represented by means of maps that allow looking at quality criteria for each point of the surface...|$|R
