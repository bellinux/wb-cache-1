30|$|The {{second step}} in {{document}} forensics is document forgery detection. A forgery could involve changing, adding, or deleting some {{information on the}} document or replacing an entire page with a counterfeited page [9]. For pasting and reprinting forgery operations, character location distortion is often introduced. Beusekon et al. [10] presented a technique for extracting text lines and alignment lines for document inspection. For English language characters, most characters align according to the <b>ascender</b> <b>line,</b> descender line, and base line. Tampered characters deviate from these three lines because of location distortion. In [11], the matching quality between all pairs of documents was used to expose tampered documents. When a page is replaced or reprinted, location distortion will occur when comparing the forged page or the tampered region with a genuine document. By computing the matching quality of two page images, the forged page or tampered region will be detected. Farid and Kee [12] established a printer model for characters to detect documents forged by different printers. They used principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) to model the degradation of a page caused by printing, and the resulting printer profile was then used to distinguish between characters generated from different printers.|$|E
5000|$|Lee was an {{advertising}} design director and designed Impact with posters and publicity material in mind. Its thick strokes, compressed letterspacing, and minimal interior counterform are specifically aimed, {{as its name}} suggests, to [...] "impact". Impact has a high x-height, reaching nearly to three-quarters the capital <b>line.</b> <b>Ascenders</b> are short, and descenders even shorter. With narrow apertures and folded-up letterforms, the lower-case can be quite hard to read printed small, especially for people with vision problems. The face is intended for headlines and display use rather than body text. As a display design, it was not released with an italic or bold weight.|$|R
