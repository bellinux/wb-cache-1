5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and <b>alluvium.</b> The <b>alluvium</b> has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal. As pointed out by early French observers, soils {{in the region are}} generally composed of sand and clay, differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{study area}} that is {{situated}} in northeastern of the Lake Van contains hot and cold water in the Muradiye-Çaldıran basin. There are Paleozoic-Mesozoic metamorphic units based on the stratigraphic sequence {{in the region and}} that units include reservoir rocks in the geothermal field. There are Quaternary <b>alluviums,</b> Plıyo - Quaternary volcanic rocks such as basalt, basaltıc tuf, tuf-basalt, basalt with gravel and Late Paleozoic metamorphic series in the field from top to base, respectively. Quaternary <b>alluviums</b> and Plıyo - Quaternary volcanic rocks show the cap rock features. Structurally, there are right-lateral faults with NW-SE directional, which constitute in Neo-tectonic period, Middle Miocene in the field. Aim of this study is investigation of hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical properties of a geothermal field, eastern Turkey. In this study, samples were taken from 34 points including springs, wells, and analyzed in Muradiye-Çaldıran geothermal field; eight of them are hot water, one of them is mineralized water and 25 of them are cold water. Geothermal springs are parallel to the faults. Also, physical measurements such as pH, EC and temperature were applied in-situ {{and as a result of}} measurements temperature changes between 8. 8 °C and 34. 7 °C, pH changes between 6. 80 and 8. 81 and EC changes between 60 and 3420 μS/cm. When geophysical studies examined which are carried out in the center of the field (Çaldıran-Ayrancılar) for the purpose of investigation of geothermal energy resources, is seen a little geothermal activity zone, is not seen very active tectonic and detected a geothermal field with low enthalpy.

40|$|Abstract: Cyprus Clays {{occurred}} {{as a result}} of the alteration of the Troodos ophiolite and the pelagic sedimentary cycles that followed in the post Createceous period. A large part of Cyprus is covered by clay formations with intermediate to extremely high swelling potential and high calcium corbonate content. Cyprus Clays can be divided into five main groups; 1. Bentonitic Clays, 2. Clays of Mamonia Complex, 3. Clays of Kythrea Group, 4. Clays of Nicosia Formation and 5. Alluvial Clays. The first four groups are overconsolidated clays of high swelling potential. Geological formations containing clays of high swelling potential are significantly exposed around Nicosia and Famagusta. There is widespread damage observed to the buildings, major roads and highways all over the Island which were founded on swelling clays. Landslides occur at the steep and very steep slopes of these formations. The <b>alluviums</b> comprise loose-medium dense gravel and sand, and soft-firm silt and clay. Mostly contain low amounts of clay size material. The <b>alluviums</b> also contain high amounts of montmorillonite. These clayey soils have low to intermediate swelling potential.

5|$|There is {{no obvious}} visual {{evidence}} of the linear features usually associated with farm fields in the land surrounding Chetro Ketl, but in 1929 aerial black-and-white images by Charles Lindbergh revealed {{what appeared to be}} a rectangular plot. In the early 1970s the National Park Service (NPS) developed a remote sensing program to further investigate the area using color video imagery. When enhanced and viewed in black-and-white, the video revealed a well-defined grid pattern within a larger rectangular section of land near Chetro Ketl. The NPS employed two types of ground level remote sensing devices to search for magnetic and soil anomalies in the <b>alluvium</b> of the canyon floor. A soil density study proved inconclusive, but a magnetometer identified a rectangular feature , roughly the same size as those seen in Lindbergh's aerial photographs. The NPS researchers proposed that water had deposited iron-bearing clays in the plots, with the center showing the strongest magnetic evidence. Subsequent comparisons with older data reinforced their conclusion. They determined that had the plots been under heavy <b>alluvium</b> they would not have been detected.|$|E

30|$|Our {{study focused}} on the Brégnier-Cordon river stretch (Ain, France). This site was chosen based on three main criteria: i) {{a low level of}} human activities; ii) the {{existence}} of hydraulic and biological data (Creuzé des Châtelliers 1991; Bornette et al. 1998 a) and iii) the existence of previous studies (Michal 1988; Bornette et al. 1994). This river stretch is located 100 -km upstream from the city of Lyon from KP 116 to KP 91 (KP: kilometric distance from a reference point, the Rhône-Saône confluence, thus decreasing from upstream to downstream; Figure  1). The Rhône River flows from the north-east to the south-west, and the slope ranges between 0.7 and 1 ‰. The average river discharge is approximately 423  m 3 /s, varies from 160  m 3 /s to 1900  m 3 /s, and is governed by a pluvio-nival type regime. The strong slope is associated with plentiful sediment transport from the tributaries of the Pré-Alps Mountains, and a wide range of braided-style flow regimes has developed (Creuzé des Châtelliers 1991; Bravard et al. 1986). The geology of the area is a complex mix of karstic limestone mountains and molassic hills that surrounds a large alluvial floodplain. The left bank of the river consists of partially karstified limestone formations in the eastern part (KP 110 to KP 100) and a large area molassic hills in the western part from KP 99 to the downstream end of the sector. The right bank consists of karstic limestone and marls of the Jurassic period, which is known as Bugey Mountain and stretches from KP 105 to the downstream end of the sector. A small karstic Mountain, Mont de Cordon, is isolated between two channels of the river between KP 2 and KP 3 (Figure  1). The floodplain around the river is a glacial valley that has been refilled with quaternary <b>alluviums.</b> The hydraulic conductivity of these <b>alluviums</b> decreases from 1 [*]×[*] 10 – 3 to 1 [*]×[*] 10 – 5  m/s and the thickness close to the Rhône River is approximately 10  m (Chauve 2006).|$|R

40|$|Lake Sfanta Ana {{is one of}} {{the most}} emblematic {{lacustrine}} complexes of our country. In this context, its monitoring is not only necessary but also compulsory. The study of its evolution and the forecasts are done easier because we have had hydrotopometric highs for about 100 years, even if the frequency of evaluations has not been periodical. The morphometric elements have had a normal evolution, of continuous diminution, specific to lacustrine complexes. The modification rates of the morphometric parameters are different, but they all highlight the necessity of taking urgent measures of protection, in order to slow down the filling speed of the lake basin. Silting is fast due to anthropic influences. The tourism activity produces, direct and indirectly, <b>alluviums</b> that reach inside the lake, due to the processes occurred on the slopes of the crater.

40|$|The Lambersart "les Conquerants" trench {{sequence}} {{is made of}} a Shelly loam topped by coarse <b>alluviums.</b> The whole is covered by several meters thick pleniglacial loess. The palynological and malacological data shows that this Shelly loam deposit occured during Early Glacial, in cold and moist conditions and ended in a more temperate interstadial.

It broke Early glacial soils and disturbed their archaeological and palaeontological remains. Sandy and silty beds settled in the lower part. Thereafter, this valley deposit is broken appart from the slope by a transitional aera. The latter shows narrow; deepless and mobile channels infilled by sand, gravels, and a younger Shelly loam. Afterwards, pleniglacial loess accumulations grew up the slope on the previous valley bottom formations, yet protecting them.

40|$|Numerous Quaternary faults {{are found}} in north-central Iran with an {{insignificant}} history of seismic activity. Having either strike-slip or thrust mechanisms, these faults are potentially active and therefore capable of creating destructive earthquakes. In this paper, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images were used, for the first time, to map these Quaternary faults located in an abandoned area {{to the west of}} Kavir Plain in north-central Iran. We also demonstrate the use of satellite imagery to identify Quaternary faults in an unpopulated area using geomorphological features, such as deformed quaternary <b>alluviums,</b> deflected stream channels, shutter ridges and sag ponds, and also fault scarps. The major mapped faults have two main northwest and northeast trends. These faults are following the trends of their counterparts in the eastern and western Alborz range. Despite the evidence of activity in the Quaternary faults, no large earthquakes have been recorded in the study area and therefore they can be considered as only potentially active faults.

40|$|Issues, {{related to}} the {{clarification}} of hydrodynamic pressure on arch and gravity dams, were the topic of all last congresses on seismic resistance, because they are directly connected with reliability control of these important facilities. Impact of water pressure on the dam in case of earthquake depends {{on a number of}} factors, including vibratory energy absorption by the bottom of the reservoir that plays a significant role. However the determination of the absorption parameter involves considerable difficulties, because it is influenced by properties of a bottom material and <b>alluviums,</b> silt, debris and so on. It makes this characteristic substantially uncertain. Stationary and non-stationary plane problems of hydromechanics for a semi-infinite fluid layer of finite depth are considered. Hydrodynamic pressure on the vertical upstream face of the dam under the horizontal seismic load with energy absorption on the reservoir bottom and a layer of sediment is determined. Uncertain factors are the amplitude of the impact and the absorption parameter.
