5|$|Heading {{into the}} game against Mike Bellotti's Oregon Ducks, Oklahoma {{defensive}} coordinator Brent Venables made some major changes to the defensive depth chart after giving up four long running plays {{through the heart of}} the defensive line <b>against</b> <b>Washington.</b> The starters at defensive tackle, cornerback, and strong safety were all demoted, opening opportunities for some freshmen to step up. D.J. Wolfe was replaced by Marcus Walker at cornerback while senior Jason Carter started in place of Keenan Clayton at strong safety. Carter replaced Clayton in the game <b>against</b> <b>Washington</b> after a missed tackle by the freshman led to a Husky touchdown on their first offensive play. Even though all four players at defensive tackle had almost the same number of plays, Steven Coleman was moved {{off the top of the}} depth chart as well.|$|E

5|$|Dunham {{scored a}} career-high 32 points <b>against</b> <b>Washington</b> State in the Old Spice Classic, a tournament record. As a result, Dunham {{was named to}} the Old Spice Classic All-Tournament Team. Through the first nine games, Dunham {{averaged}} 18.7 points per game and shot 46 percent from 3-point range. He was named Big East Player of the Week on December 16 after contributing 25 points to lead Butler past the Purdue Boilermakers, 76–70 in the Crossroads Classic. Dunham had 30 points in a 99–94 double overtime loss to DePaul on January 9 and tied his career-best with six three-pointers, all of which came in the second half.|$|E
5|$|Manning's first start, a Tennessee {{homecoming}} game <b>against</b> <b>Washington</b> State, {{resulted in}} a 109 win. Things got progressively better for the Volunteers after Manning assumed the starting role, as they won six of their final regular-season games. The sole loss was a 1317 defeat {{at the hands of}} then-No. 10 Alabama in Knoxville. The loss was merely a bump in the road, however, as Tennessee won all four regular-season games that followed, ending the regular season with a 650 drubbing of in-state rival Vanderbilt. In response to Fulmer's success at turning the team around from a slow start, he was awarded with a one-year contract extension by the university.|$|E
5|$|N'Diaye {{finished}} the 2013–14 season with averages of 7.8 points, 6.2 rebounds, 0.2 assists, 3.1 blocks, and 1.7 turnovers per game.

5|$|The Webfoots then entered {{play in the}} PCC, {{with four}} games {{scheduled}} against {{each of the four}} other teams in the conference's Northern Division; Oregon hosted each club twice and played two games at all opposing teams' arenas. At the beginning of 1939, the Webfoots began its PCC schedule with consecutive home games <b>against</b> <b>Washington</b> State on January 6 and 7. In the first, Oregon entered halftime with a nine-point advantage and prevailed by a 46–35 margin. They lost the second, 39–34, for their only home defeat of the season; the loss broke a 23-game winning streak at McArthur Court, the Webfoots' arena.|$|E
5|$|After {{suffering}} a foot injury {{during the first}} home match of the 2014 season on April 14, Rapinoe sat out several games and made her second season appearance on July 3 against Western New York Flash. Her four goals and one assist {{during the regular season}} helped the Reign secure the league's regular season title (NWSL Shield) with a 16–2–6 record and 54 points – 13 points ahead of the second place team, FC Kansas City. During the team's playoff semi-final match <b>against</b> <b>Washington</b> Spirit, Rapinoe scored a goal helping the Reign win 2–1 and advance to the championship final against FC Kansas City. Despite Rapinoe's goal during the championship final, the Reign was ultimately defeated by Kansas City 2–1.|$|E
5|$|As a freshman, Manning {{began the}} season as the third-string quarterback. In the season opener against UCLA, Manning {{was one of three}} quarterbacks to come off the bench after starter Jerry Colquitt {{suffered}} a season-ending injury on the seventh play of the game. However, Manning was not able to generate any offense and was pulled from the game. During the season's fourth game, against Mississippi State, starter Todd Helton got injured and Manning took over. The Vols lost 24–21, but Manning was named the team's starter and remained so {{for the rest of his}} college career. In his first start, the following week <b>against</b> <b>Washington</b> State, the Vols won 10–9. They won all but one of their remaining games, finishing the season 8–4 with a 45–23 victory over Virginia Tech in the 1994 Gator Bowl.|$|E

5|$|With {{two games}} {{left in the}} regular season, the Webfoots held a one-game lead over Washington, {{with a pair of}} {{contests}} scheduled in Seattle against the Huskies. Oregon required one victory to clinch the Northern Division championship. On March 3, the Webfoots defeated Washington in {{the first game of the}} series 39–26; Gale led the team in scoring with 11 points, as the team won despite missing 53 of their 67 field goal attempts. Anet suffered a dislocated finger and was held out of the second game <b>against</b> <b>Washington,</b> which took place the following day. The Webfoots claimed a two-point win, their fourth of the season over Washington. Of the Huskies' five losses in 1938–39, all but one was against the Webfoots. By the end of the regular season, Oregon had won the PCC North Division with a 14–2 conference record, and had a 24–5 record overall.|$|E
5|$|Although Lillard {{planned to}} attend the University of Minnesota, {{he changed his mind}} when Clarence Spears, the college's head {{football}} coach, left to go to the University of Oregon. Lillard decided to attend Oregon, and played for the school's freshman football team in 1930. The following year, he appeared in two games for the varsity team. Against Idaho, Lillard was responsible for all of Oregon's points in a 9–0 Ducks win. Suspected of breaking college amateurism rules by playing semi-professional baseball for the Gilkerson Colored Giants, Lillard was briefly suspended by the PCC before Oregon's next game. The suspected violation placed Lillard's collegiate eligibility in question. While he did play in games, Lillard claimed that he received money not for playing, but for driving the team. The decision was overturned; according to PCC rules, no protest was possible during the week prior to a game between PCC teams. In the game <b>against</b> <b>Washington,</b> their second of the season, the Ducks claimed an upset victory, 13–0; Lillard had a touchdown and intercepted two passes. Before Oregon's next game against USC, Lillard was ruled ineligible by the PCC as a result of playing with the Gilkerson baseball team. Spears estimated that Lillard had provided half of his team's production on offense, and USC defeated Oregon by 53 points in the game after the ruling. Lillard dropped out of the university after the PCC's decision, becoming a professional football player and playing for various All-Star teams that traveled across the United States.|$|E
5|$|Oregon {{then began}} a 10-game winning streak, their longest {{since the start}} of the 1937–38 season. Oregon State was the Webfoots' first {{opponent}} during the streak, on January 13; Oregon prevailed 31–26. In two higher-scoring contests at Washington State on January 17 and 18, the Webfoots claimed 56–44 and 57–31 victories, respectively. A five-game road trip concluded with games in Idaho on January 20 and 21. The contests were closer than those <b>against</b> <b>Washington</b> State, but the Webfoots won 38–30 in the first game and 35–31 in the second to improve to 6–1 in conference play. Oregon's next five games were at home, beginning with a second encounter against Oregon State, on January 27 that they won by a seven-point margin. Washington traveled to Oregon for games on January 31 and February 1, and 57–49 and 58–42 victories moved the Webfoots' winning streak to eight. They then concluded their four-game season series with Idaho, winning by 17 points in each game. On February 18, the Webfoots' streak ended with a 50–31 upset loss to Oregon State, which would be their last of the season. Six days later, Oregon posted a 48–37 win over the Beavers at home. That game was the Webfoots' last appearance for the 1938–39 regular season at McArthur Court; it was the school's 100th win at the arena since it was opened in 1927.|$|E

5|$|After going undrafted in the 2013 NBA draft, Pressey {{signed with}} the Boston Celtics {{to play in the}} 2013 Orlando Summer League. He was a known {{commodity}} to the Celtics. Pressey's AAU team had even practiced at the team facility in Waltham. His performance in the Summer League led to Pressey signing a deal with the Celtics on July 22, 2013. The contract was believed to be a three-year deal for the league minimum, which was $490,180 during his rookie season. The Celtics began the season without four-time All-Star point guard Rajon Rondo who had endured a anterior cruciate ligament injury during the prior season. Pressey made his regular season debut in the 2013–14 Celtics season opener on October 30 at the Air Canada Centre against the Toronto. He did not play in the next three games, but after the Celtics got off to an 04 start, head coach Brad Stevens shuffled the lineup. On November 6, at home against the Utah Jazz, Pressey recorded the first three assists, first steal and first field goal of his career. Then on November 9, he posted four assists and tallied in 7 points in 21 minutes of play. He posted a team-high 5 assists on November 19, 2013 against the Houston Rockets. He established a new career high with 8 assists on November 25 against the Charlotte Bobcats. On January 15, with Rondo's return imminent, the Celtics traded guards Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks, clearing the way for Pressey to start that night against the Toronto Raptors. Pressey posted 10 assists and no turnovers in his first start. On January 22, with Rondo, Avery Bradley and Jerryd Bayless all sitting out and Pressey making his second career start, Pressey scored a career-high 20 points <b>against</b> <b>Washington</b> before fouling out. Since Rondo's return, Pressey's occasional starts have been to give Rondo rest. He posted a double-double on April 5 against the Detroit Pistons with 12 points and a career-high 11 assists. On April 11, he had another career high with 13 assists as part of a 10-point double double against the Charlotte Bobcats. He matched the 13 assists the following night against the Cleveland Cavaliers.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{opened the}} month by taking {{two of a}} three-game series against the Giants, besting Jonathan Sánchez, who threw a no-hitter earlier in the 2009 season, and Tim Lincecum, who won the 2008 NL Cy Young Award. This was {{followed}} by a trip to Texas for a four-game series against the Houston Astros; the Phillies were unable to muster much offense during the series and were swept. On September 8, in {{the first game of the}} series against the Washington Nationals, Ibañez and Utley each hit their 30th home runs of the season, making them members of the 12th quartet of teammates in major league history to each reach 30 in a single season, joining Howard and Werth. The Phillies offense backed Lee to his sixth win the following night, with Madson earning his second consecutive save after assuming the de facto closer's role from Lidge. However, the Phillies could not overcome a pair of three-run home runs by Adam Dunn and Ian Desmond to secure the sweep in the last game of the series, despite Stairs' grand slam; it was their third loss of the season to Washington in fifteen games. The Mets came to Philadelphia for their last series of the season, which began on September 11. The Phillies won game one, 4–2, but the Mets came from behind in the second game of the series, scoring five runs in the final two innings to win 10–9. Making up a postponed game from earlier in the season, the Phillies won the first game of a day-night doubleheader behind Kyle Kendrick's first major league victory in 13 months. Eight shutout innings from Martínez in the nightcap gave the Phillies a 1–0 win, a 3–1 win in the 4-game set, and a 12–6 win in the season series. Martínez' eight innings also began a streak of 26 consecutive scoreless innings by Phillies pitchers: Madson followed with a scoreless ninth for his eighth save of the season; Cliff Lee pitched a complete game shutout against the Nationals the following night; and Blanton, Park, and Madson combined for eight scoreless innings <b>against</b> <b>Washington</b> on September 16 until Tyler Walker allowed a run in the top of the ninth inning, an RBI single by Willie Harris which scored Justin Maxwell. Hamels closed out the series with a strong performance, perfect through his first five innings and finishing with one run allowed in eight; with their 15th win over the Nationals, the Phillies matched their best season record against the franchise, set against the 1976 Montréal Expos.|$|E
5|$|When Epstein's {{field goal}} attempt for the 2001 Wolverines was blocked on September 8 with 9:11 {{remaining}} <b>against</b> <b>Washington</b> and run {{back for a}} touchdown, it gave the Huskies a lead {{that they would not}} relinquish {{on the way to a}} 23–18 game. Epstein made a 51-yard field goal against Iowa on October 27 to give Michigan a 6-point lead with 3:57 remaining. The 32–26 score held up. He posted a school record 57-yard field goal against Michigan State in the November 3, 2001 Michigan–Michigan State football rivalry game known as Clockgate. However, later in the game, Epstein's short punt and two Michigan penalties, made way for Michigan State's controversial game-winning drive. He made the game-winning 31-yard field goal against the Wisconsin on November 17, 2001 with 10 seconds left. Epstein set up the field goal when his punt bounced off of Badger Brett Bell and was recovered by Brandon Williams with 14 seconds left. In the game 3 of his 8 punts were downed inside the 20 yard line, including a 48-yarder that was downed on the 1-yard-line to set up Michigan's first score. 3 of his 5 kickoffs were touchbacks and a fourth one into the end zone was just returned 15 yards. Epstein's performance earned him Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week recognition and his 8 points (2 FGs and 2 PATs) gave him the team scoring lead with 69 points. He finished the season with 76 points (13–20 FGs and 37–37 PATs) and 71 punts for 2790 yards (39.3 average/17 inside 20). Epstein's single-season punt yardage total was a school record that was surpassed the following season by Adam Finley. His 76 points just edged out B. J. Askew's 72 points and Marquise Walker's 68 points. Epstein earned All-Big Ten Conference second team honors as a placekicker from the coaches and honorable mention honors by both the coaches and media as a punter. He concluded his career by making 2 field goals in the January 26, 2002 Senior Bowl.|$|E
