However, different studies have pointed the risk of crop injury and grain sorghum yield reduction with postemergence applications of 2, 4 -D. No research data on grain sorghum response to 2, 4 -D or dicamba exists in the Southeastern United States. Consequently, a study was conducted to investigate crop growth and yield response to 2, 4 -D (100, 220, and 330 [*]g <b>acid</b> <b>equivalent</b> ha− 1) and dicamba (280 [*]g <b>acid</b> <b>equivalent</b> ha− 1) applied on 20 to 65 [*]cm tall sorghum.
