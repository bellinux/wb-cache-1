5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather {{formed on}} August 26, 2003 <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> westward. The disturbed weather {{then began to}} organize and the system became a tropical depression on August 28. Moving westward over waters greater than 82°F (28°C), Tropical Depression Ten-E rapidly strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Jimena by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|Many educated Sudanese were {{suspicious}} of the Council <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> towards the Khatmiyya side in the 1944 elections, not for religious reasons but because they were hostile to the government, wanted to retain links with Egypt as a counterpoise to British influence {{and did not want}} a monarchy under Sayyid Abd al-Rahman.|$|E
5|$|A greater misfortune {{occurred}} {{at the onset of}} the southern winter when the Aurora, locked in an ice-floe which broke off from the main shelf, was torn from its moorings. The ocean currents then pulled ship further away from the sledding parties marooned on shore <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> for over six months before breaking free of the ice. Sadly the Aurora's damaged rudder forced her to return to New Zealand rather than returning for the stranded shore party.|$|E
40|$|The {{statistical}} {{interpretation of}} the Theory of Natural Selection claims that natural selection <b>and</b> <b>drift</b> are statistical features of mathematical aggregates of individual-level events. Natural selection <b>and</b> <b>drift</b> are not themselves causes. The statistical interpretation is motivated by a metaphysical conception of individual priority. Recently, Millstein, Skipper, and Dietrich (2009) have argued (a) that natural selection <b>and</b> <b>drift</b> are physical processes, and (b) that the statistical interpretation rests on a misconception {{of the role of}} mathematics in biology.

40|$|Observations of pre-transitional disks show {{a narrow}} inner dust ring {{and a larger}} outer one. They are {{separated}} by a cavity with no or only little dust. We propose an efficient recycling mechanism for the inner dust ring which keeps it in a steady-state. No major particle sources are needed for replenishment. Dust particles <b>and</b> pebbles <b>drift</b> outwards by radiation pressure and photophoresis. The pebbles grow during outward drift until they reach a balanced position where residual gravity compensates photophoresis. While still growing larger they reverse their motion <b>and</b> <b>drift</b> inwards. Eventually, their speed is fast enough that they get destroyed in collisions with other pebbles <b>and</b> <b>drift</b> outwards again. We quantify the force balance <b>and</b> <b>drift</b> velocities for the disks LkCa 15 and HD 135344 B. We simulate single particle evolution and show that this scenario is viable. Growth <b>and</b> <b>drift</b> timescales {{are on the same}} order and a steady state can be established in the inner dust ring...|$|R

5|$|On the Potomac River, where tides ran {{well above}} normal, ships broke free from their {{moorings}} <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> downstream. In one instance, a large steamship called the George Leary struck and damaged six other ships. Numerous vessels capsized in the river, including the steamer Mary Washington and the schooner John W. Linnell. At the Washington Navy Yard, multiple buildings sustained damage. Overall losses in Washington, D.C. were approximately $400,000, {{and at least}} two dozen individuals in the city suffered injuries from falling debris.|$|E
5|$|Otis began {{gradually}} entering cooler ocean waters, {{although the}} National Hurricane Center noted {{in one of}} its discussions on the system that the environment was still warm enough to support a stronger storm. The hurricane continued drifting northwestward, and early on October 1 it reached peak intensity at Category 2 status. At the time, maximum sustained winds were at 105mph (165km/h) and barometric pressure was recorded at 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg). Hours later, however, it began to weaken, a trend that continued due to southwesterly wind shear and dry air. The cloud pattern associated with the hurricane deteriorated on October 2, and the center of circulation was separated from the convective activity. Otis weakened to a tropical storm <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> erratically toward the north-northwest as a result of weak steering currents. Over increasingly cold waters, the cyclone further weakened to a depression on October 3 and consisted of a small swirl of low-level clouds. It became a remnant low pressure area the next day. The system abruptly turned southeastward <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> parallel to the coast of the Baja California Peninsula until dissipating on October 5.|$|E

5|$|The storm struck southwestern Haiti near peak intensity, {{turned to}} the west, <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> over Cuba for four days before turning to the northeast. Flora passed over the Bahamas and {{accelerated}} northeastward, becoming an extratropical cyclone on October 12. Due to its slow movement across Cuba, Flora is the wettest known tropical cyclone for Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. The significant casualties caused by Flora were the most for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Basin since the 1900 Galveston Hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Within minutes Calypso {{had also}} veered its cable so that Italienne, now beached, could resume {{fire on the}} British squadron, but the frigate overcompensated <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> stern-first onto the shore. The British ships {{continued}} their fire until the rapidly falling tide forced them to retire one by one, with Defiance being the last to retire at 12:15. The squadron then returned for one more pass, the final shots fired by Donegal, before Stopford ordered them to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|A broad mid-tropospheric trough {{over the}} southeastern United States spawned {{an area of}} {{convection}} over the lower Mississippi River Valley on July 13, <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> southward towards the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. As it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, a weak and isolated surface low pressure area formed {{off the coast of}} Louisiana. The circulation in the system steadily expanded, and initially the surface winds and convection were intermittent. On July 16, deep convection increased and organized near the center, and oil rigs and surface buoys reported surface winds of 30mph (50km/h). Based on the observations, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Four on July 16 while about 150miles (240km) south of the southwestern Louisiana coastline.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a network synchronization technique based on bidirectional message exchanges between randomly chosen node pairs {{without the use}} of timestamps. Each node in the network has a clock with independent stochastic delay <b>and</b> <b>drift.</b> Relative delay <b>and</b> <b>drift</b> synchronization information is conveyed implicitly in the physical layer through the timing of responses to directed messages. Simultaneous delay <b>and</b> <b>drift</b> correction is performed by the node initiating the message exchange. Steady-state synchronization per-formance bounds are developed {{as a function of the}} synchronization stepsize parameter and the statistics of the delay <b>and</b> <b>drift</b> estimation errors. Numerical results for two different connectivity scenarios show that synchronization among the nodes can be achieved with-out the overhead of digital timestamps, a dedicated synchronization protocol, or network hierarchy.

5|$|Hurricane Alberto {{caused the}} worst {{flooding}} in western Cuba in 32years. The first tropical storm and hurricane of the 1982 Atlantic hurricane season, Alberto developed from a tropical disturbance on June 2 {{in the southern}} Gulf of Mexico. It rapidly organized and attained hurricane status the following day, the earliest date for a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean since Hurricane Alma in May 1970. Shortly after reaching peak winds off 85mph (140km/h), Alberto rapidly weakened due to approaching upper-level winds. Initial forecasts predicted the hurricane would continue northeastward into Florida; it turned sharply westward <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> erratically for several days across the eastern Gulf of Mexico, before dissipating on June 6.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Martha {{has been}} the only known {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall in Panama. The eighteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Martha developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November21. Initially, the storm developed with sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h), skipping tropical depression status. It remained stationary and quickly intensified into a hurricane. Martha attained maximum sustained winds of 90mph (150km/h) on November22. Subsequently, Martha weakened <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> southward. On November24, Martha made landfall in Veraguas Province, Panama, as a strong tropical storm. The system weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over land on November25.|$|E
5|$|The 1914 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the least}} active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} on record, with only one known tropical storm. Although hurricane season typically encompasses a much larger time-span, actual activity was confined {{to the middle of}} September. The only tropical cyclone of the year developed in the region of The Bahamas on September 15 <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> northwestward, moving inland over Florida and Georgia. Thorough warnings before the storm prevented any major damage. The 1914 season is one of only two that did not produce any hurricanes (the other being the 1907 season). Due to the lack of modern technology, including satellite imagery, information is often sparse, and an additional tropical depression may have existed in late October. Additionally, this was the first hurricane season to take place during World War I.|$|E

Gibraltars crew and officers helped man the fireships, which were limited in the damage they caused by a boom placed across the channel. This was breached by one of the explosive vessels, however, and the French panicked, slipped their anchors, <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> onto the shore. Gibraltars Lieutenant John Cookesley, who commanded one of the fireships, and Master's mate John Conyer were both badly burnt during the operation.|$|E

Shortly after, the band left Sparrow <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> {{out of the public}} eye. A final album, entitled The Rise of Modern Simulation was independently released before the group disbanded in 2003. Many of the band members continue to play together and collaborate in various bands, namely Mutemath and Club of the Sons.|$|E
5|$|Convection {{began to}} {{increase}} on July 6, {{supported on the}} basis that many showers were observed {{to the north of the}} depression. An anticyclone—a large mass of air rotating clockwise—intensified within the depression's vicinity, resulting in a tighter pressure gradient and increasing winds to the north of the center of the depression. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Cindy early on July 7, and a reconnaissance flight into the storm late during the afternoon observed maximum sustained winds of 60–65mph (95–100km/h) and a minimum pressure of 997mbar (hPa; 29.44inHg). Cindy began to curve westward late on July 7 as it reached peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg), <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> due west early on July 8 as a result of a maturing surface high to its north. Steady intensification continued throughout the day, and the storm attained hurricane status during the morning of July 8.|$|E

5|$|Dean Lyons {{was born}} on 20 April 1973; he was 24 when he was arrested. He grew up in Tallaght in West Dublin, the fourth {{in a family of}} six children. He went to Scoil Aonghusa National School in Tallaght, where he had some {{difficulty}} with his schoolwork. According to his teachers, in today's terms, he would have been classified as having a moderate general learning disability. He was assessed by a psychologist when he was in sixth class, around the age of twelve, who found him to have an intelligence quotient of 70. As a result of the psychologist's report, Lyons was moved to St. Joseph's Special School in Tallaght. During his period in St. Joseph's, he developed a reputation for attention seeking and storytelling. After school, he never held down a steady job <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> into heroin addiction and homelessness. At the time of his arrest for the Grangegorman murders, he had one conviction for burglary, and had been involved in a number of syringe robberies.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, many architects {{studying}} in Italy learned of Palladio's work. Foreign architects then returned home and adapted Palladio's style to suit various climates, topographies and personal tastes of their clients. Isolated forms of Palladianism {{throughout the world}} were brought about in this way. However, the Palladian style did not reach the zenith of its popularity until the 18th century, primarily in England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland and later North America. In Venice itself there was an early reaction to the excesses of Baroque architecture that manifested itself as a return to Palladian principles. The earliest neo-Palladians there were the exact contemporaries, both trained up as masons, Domenico Rossi (1657–1737) and Andrea Tirali (1657–1737). Tommaso Temanza, their biographer, {{proved to be the}} movement's most able and learned proponent; in his hands the visual inheritance of Palladio's example became increasingly codified in correct rules <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> towards neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|The Oort cloud {{is thought}} to be a remnant of the {{original}} protoplanetary disc that formed around the Sun approximately 4.6billion years ago. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that the Oort cloud's objects initially coalesced much closer to the Sun as part of the same process that formed the planets and minor planets, but that gravitational interaction with young gas giants such as Jupiter ejected the objects into extremely long elliptic or parabolic orbits. Recent research has been cited by NASA hypothesizing {{that a large number of}} Oort cloud objects are the product of an exchange of materials between the Sun and its sibling stars as they formed <b>and</b> <b>drifted</b> apart, and it is suggested that many—possibly the majority of—Oort cloud objects did not form in close proximity to the Sun. Simulations of the evolution of the Oort cloud from the beginnings of the Solar System to the present suggest that the cloud's mass peaked around 800million years after formation, as the pace of accretion and collision slowed and depletion began to overtake supply.|$|E
