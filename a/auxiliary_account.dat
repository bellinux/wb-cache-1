50|$|An {{effective}} {{approach for}} the compensation of losses in metamaterials, called plasmon injection scheme, has been recently proposed. The plasmon injection scheme {{has been applied}} theoretically to imperfect negative index flat lenses with reasonable material losses and {{in the presence of}} noise as well as hyperlenses. It has been shown that even imperfect negative index flat lenses assisted with plasmon injection scheme can enable subdiffraction imaging of objects which is otherwise not possible due to the losses and noise. Although plasmon injection scheme was originally conceptualized for plasmonic metamaterials, the concept is general and applicable to all types electromagnetic modes. The main idea of the scheme is the coherent superposition of the lossy modes in the metamaterial with an appropriately structured external auxiliary field. This <b>auxiliary</b> field <b>accounts</b> for the losses in the metamaterial, hence effectively reduces the losses experienced by the signal beam or object field {{in the case of a}} metamaterial lens. The plasmon injection scheme can be implemented either physically or equivalently through deconvolution post-processing method. However, the physical implementation has shown to be more effective than the deconvolution. Physical construction of convolution and selective amplification of the spatial frequencies within a narrow bandwidth are the keys to the physical implementation of the plasmon injection scheme. This loss compensation scheme is ideally suited especially for metamaterial lenses since it does not require gain medium, nonlinearity, or any interaction with phonons. Experimental demonstration of the plasmon injection scheme has not yet been shown partly because the theory is rather new.|$|R

AdditiveManufacturing (AM) {{has proven to be a}} promising manufacturing process regarding environmental and economic aspects, where one of the key environmental benefits of AM has been accounted to material savings. Recently, a new class of manufacturing processes called Hybrid Manufacturing (HM) have emerged, where AM and traditional machining are combined in one machine tool, exploiting the strengths of additive and subtractive manufacturing. As the energy requirements in HM is seldom explored in existing literature, the work of this Master's thesis aims towards developing an energy assessment framework for the HM system. This was achieved by identifying the underlying subsystems as energy consuming units. A system engineering methodology was employed for the design and analysis of the framework. To validate the proposed framework, a case study was designed to investigate the environmental footprint of multiple components made of a Titanium alloy using different processing routes. The outcome of the case study identified the energy consuming units within an HM machine and provided a baseline for a life cycle-based environmental comparison of different manufacturing approaches. The results suggested that the energy consumption in HM is stable, where the <b>auxiliary</b> systems <b>account</b> for the dominant part of the energy consumption and that process parameters not influencing the process time is relatively insignificant.

It {{presents}} a unified analysis of South Slavic and English <b>auxiliaries</b> and <b>accounts</b> for {{the distribution of}} South Slavic clitic clusters. The analysis moves much minor cross-linguistic variation out of the syntax into the lexicon {{and the level of}} Phonological Form. Following a critique of various approaches to lexical insertion in Chomskyan models, we adapt Emonds' (1994, 1997) theory of syntactic and phonological lexicalization for a model employing bare phrase structure. We redefine 'extended projection' in this theory, and revise the mechanism of 'Alternative Realization', whereby formal features associated with (possibly null) XP may be realised on another node. Pronominal clitics are one example of Alternative Realization. We claim that the Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian clitic cluster is phonologically lexicalized on the highest head in the extended projection. The clitic auxiliaries in SCB are not auxiliaries, but the altemative realization of features in 1 º without categorial specification, hence the distribution of the clitic cluster as a whole. We show how a verb's extended projection may be extended by 'restructuring' verbs, allowing clitic climbing. In Bulgarian/Macedonian, the clausal clitic cluster appears on the highest [+V] head in the extended projection, determined by the categorial specifications of the auxiliaries. In the DP, the possessive dative clitic forms a clitic cluster with the determmer, its distribution determined by the realization of the Dº feature. SCB and Bulgarian clitic clusters require a phonological host in the domain of lexicalization: phonological lexicalization into the Wackemagel Position occurs as a 'last resort'. The treatment of auxiliaries and restructuring verbs m English and South Slavic derives from their lexical entries. Dual lexicalization and bracketing of features in the lexicon allows variation in trace licensing, optional word orders, and minor language-specific phonological idiosyncrasies...|$|R

This paper presents an exploratory analysis of the suitability of supercritical CO 2 Brayton power cycles (S-CO 2) for low-temperature divertor fusion reactors cooled by helium (as defined by EFDA). Integration of three thermal sources (i. e., blanket, divertor and vacuum vessel) has been studied through proposing and analyzing a number of alternative layouts, achieving an improvement on power production higher than 5 % over the baseline case, which entails to a gross efficiency (before self-consumptions) higher than 42 %. In spite of this achievement, the assessment of power consumption for the circulating heat transfer fluids results in a penalty of 20 % in the electricity production. Once the most suitable layout has been selected an optimization process has been conducted to adjust the key parameters to balance performance and size, achieving an electrical efficiency (electricity without taking into <b>account</b> <b>auxiliary</b> consumptions due to operation of the fusion reactor) higher than 33 % and a reduction in overall size of heat exchangers of 1 / 3. Some relevant conclusions can be drawn from the present work: the potential of S-CO 2 cycles as suitable converters of thermal energy to power in fusion reactors; the significance of a suitable integration of thermal sources to maximize power output; the high penalty of pumping power; and the convenience of identifying the key components of the layout as a way to optimize the whole cycle performance. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

The evolution of economically relevant life-history traits in fish, which can occur due to the harvesting pressure from commercial fisheries, can irreversibly diminish fisheries yields and ecological services. I model the interactions between the genetics, population structure, and economics of the fishery in order to determine whether the economic implications of this rapid evolution (called fisheries-induced evolution or FIE) are as potentially consequential as ecologists predict. My model is based on North-East Arctic Cod, which are long lived and for which an abundance of information exists, including proof of FIE. I compare the steady state reached by a `myopic’ fishery manager who sets effort and mesh size policy while ignoring evolution, to one who dynamically optimizes his strategy with the knowledge of how evolution will respond. This paper shows that ignoring evolution may lead to some profit loss, but not likely the `catastrophic’ amount of loss predicted by biologists. While the value of the fishery is somewhat improved when evolution is accounted for, an important <b>auxiliary</b> benefit of <b>accounting</b> for evolution is that the fish stock is healthier, with a larger biomass and a more balanced age-structure.

Conversely, in order to exploit the informative content and quantify the related uncertainty of HVSR data it is necessary to utilize a deep spatial statistical analysis and objective interpolation approaches. Moreover, the interpolation approach should make it possible to use expert knowledge and auxiliary information. Accordingly, we present an integrated geostatistical approach applied to HVSR data, collected for retrieving information on the morphology of a buried bedrock surface. The geostatistical study is conducted on an experimental dataset of 116 HVSR data collected in a small thermal basin located in the Venetian Plain (Caldiero Basin, N-E Italy). The explorative geostatistical analysis of the data coupled with the use of interpolation kriging techniques permit the extraction of relevant information on the resonance properties of the subsoil. The utilized approach, based on kriging with external drift (or its extension, i. e. regression kriging), permits the researcher to take into <b>account</b> <b>auxiliary</b> information, evaluate the related prediction uncertainty, and highlight abrupt variations in subsoil resonance frequencies. The results of the analysis are discussed, also with reflections pertaining to the geo-engineering and geo-environmental context...|$|R
30|$|Remote sensing images {{classification}} is {{a complex}} process that may be affected by many factors, such as the availability of high-quality images, proper classification method, and the analytical ability of scientists. For a particular problem, {{it is often difficult}} to identify the best classifier due to the lack of a guideline for selection and the availability of suitable classification approaches to band. Therefore, many researchers proposed all kinds of algorithms to address the remote sensing images classification problems. In [1], the authors built textural information model that use spatial information, and then proposed a wavelet-based multi-scale strategy to characterize local texture, taking the physical nature of the data into account, then the extracted textural information was used as new feature to build a texture kernel and the final kernel was the weighted sum of a kernel made with the spectral information and the texture kernel. In [2], the authors proposed applying kernels on a segmentation graph method. Fauvel et al. [3] proposed a spatial-spectral kernel-based approach with the spatial and spectral information were jointly used for the classification. A kernel-based block matrix decomposition approach for the classification of remotely sensed images was proposed by Gao et al. [4]. Tuia et al. [5] used active learning to adapt remote sensing image classifiers. Their goal is to select these pixels in an intelligent fashion that minimizes their number and maximizes their information content. Two strategies based on uncertainty and clustering of the data space are considered to perform active selection. In [6], Dos Santos J.A. et al. proposed a method for interactive classification of remote sensing images considering multiscale segmentation. Their aim is to improve the selection of training samples using the features from the most appropriate scales of representation. They use a boosting-based active learning strategy to select regions at various scales for user’s relevance feed back. However, these approaches may ignore the auxiliary data of the remote sensing images. In other words, they do not take the <b>auxiliary</b> data into <b>account</b> in the classification model. In this paper, we aim to transfer the texture feature information from the auxiliary data to the target data to improve the classification performance of remote sensing images.|$|R
40|$|Topography exerts {{influence}} on the spatial precipitation distribution over different scales, known typically at the large scale as the orographic effect, and at the small scale as the wind-drift rainfall (WDR) effect. At the intermediate scale (~ 1 – 10 km), which is characterized by secondary mountain valleys, topography also demonstrates some effect on the precipitation pattern. This paper investigates such intermediate-scale topographic effect on precipitation patterns, focusing on narrow-steep valleys in the complex terrain in southern Germany, based on the daily observations over a 48 -yr period (~ 1960 – 2007) from a high-density rain-gauge network covering two sub-areas, Baden-Wuerttemberg (BW) and Bayern (BY). Precipitation data at the valley and non-valley stations are compared under consideration of the daily general circulation patterns (CPs) classified by a fuzzy-rule based algorithm. Scatter plots of precipitation against elevation demonstrate a different behavior of valley stations comparing to non-valley stations. A detailed study of the precipitation time series for selected station triplets, each consisting of a valley station, a mountain station and an open station have been investigated by statistical analysis with the Kolmogrov–Smirnov (KS) test supplemented by the {{one-way analysis of variance}} (one-way ANOVA) and a graphical comparison of the means. The results show an interaction of valley orientation and the moisture flow direction of the CPs at the intermediate-scale, i. e. when the valley is shielded from the moisture flow, the precipitation amount within the valley is comparable to that on the mountain crest; when the valley is open to the moisture flow, the precipitation within the valley is much less than that on the mountain. Such a phenomenon, whereby the precipitation is "blind" to the valleys at the intermediate scale conditioned on CPs, is defined as the "narrow-valley effect" in this work, and it cannot be captured by the widely used elevation–precipitation relationship. This implies that the traditional geostatistical interpolation schemes, e. g. ordinary kriging (OK) or external drift kriging (EDK) applying digital elevation model (DEM) as external information are not sufficient. An interpolation experiment applying EDK with orographic surrogate elevation defined in this paper as <b>auxiliary</b> information to <b>account</b> for the valley effects shows improvement for the cross-validation...|$|R
