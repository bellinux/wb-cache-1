50|$|The {{bottom of}} the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> has a guide cap with {{perforations}} so that during the downward movement of the <b>axle</b> <b>guide</b> in the lower spring seat, the oil in the dashpot rushes in the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide.</b> This provides the dampening of vibration in a running coach.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{suspension}} in an ICF Bogie {{is through a}} dashpot arrangement. The dashpot arrangement consists of a cylinder (lower spring seat) and the piston (<b>axle</b> box <b>guide).</b> <b>Axle</b> box springs are placed on the lower spring seat placed on the axle box wing of the axle box housing assembly. A rubber or a Hytrel washer is placed below the lower spring seat for cushioning effect. The <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> is welded to the bogie frame. The <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> acts as a piston. A homopolymer acetyle washer {{is placed on the}} lower end of the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide.</b> The end portion of the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> is covered with a guide cap, which has holes in it. A sealing ring is placed near the washer and performs the function of a piston ring. The <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> moves in the lower spring seat filled with dashpot oil. This arrangement provides the dampening effect during the running of the coach.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} piston {{arrangement of the}} dashpot, i.e. the Lower Spring seat and the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> is not fully sealed due to the limitation of the design and practical applicability. Its design provides that when a vertical vibration occurs during {{the movement of the}} railway coach, the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> moves down. The downward movement of the <b>Axle</b> box <b>guide</b> puts pressure on the oil in the lower spring seat. The oil rushes up. However, since there are holes in the guide cap, the oil passes through these holes into the hollow body of the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide.</b> This helps in dampening the vertical vibrations. The <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> displaces the oil in the lower spring seat and pushes it upwards. Since, only part quantity of oil is able to move up in the hollow portion of the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide,</b> the balance displaced oil moves up.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, rubber washers {{have been}} used at the seating {{arrangement}} of the primary springs of the axle box housing in the ICF design passenger coaches on the Indian Railways. The rubber washer is used directly on the axle box seating area. the lower spring seat sits on the washers. The lower spring seat is a tubular structure and 3/4 section is partitioned by using a circular ring which is welded at the 3/4 section. On the top of spring seat, a polymer ring called NFTC ring sits. The primary spring sits on the NFTC ring. The lower spring seat {{plays the role of}} a cylinder in the dashpot arrangement and is filled with oil. In the dashpot arrangement, the top portion is called the <b>axle</b> box <b>guide.</b> The <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> is welded to the bogie frame. The <b>axle</b> box <b>guide</b> works as a piston in the Lower spring seat filled with oil. This helps in damping the vibrations caused during running train operation.|$|R

A model of a bus has been created in the simulation system environment. Its steady state and transient directional behaviour has been compared with experimental results. The structure of the model contains parametrical substructures of the front wheel suspension and rear axle. The ride of the vehicle model along the general track is performed by an approximate model of the driver behaviour. The influence of vehicle load on its directional properties has been shown. The control strategy for all wheel steering, that is able to ensure vehicle neutral behaviour independent on lateral acceleration level, has been formulaed. The steady state as well as transient response of the vehicle with active elements in the rear <b>axle</b> <b>guide</b> has been analysed. The results of the simulations show, that the achieved neutral vehicle behaviour is not dependent on the vehicle load.

30|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the systematic study of wear, many classification schemes have been devised. However, though covering the whole field in sum, they stay only loosely connected to each other and do not build a complete general picture. To this end, here we try to combine and integrate existing approaches into a general simple scheme unifying known wear types into a consistent system. The suggested scheme is based on three classifying criterions answering the questions “why”, “how” and “where” and defining a 3 -D space filled with the known wear types. The system can be used in teaching to introduce students to such complex phenomena as wear and also in engineering practice to <b>guide</b> <b>wear</b> mitigation initiatives.|$|R

In-office bleaching was performed with 35 % hydrogen peroxide, and in the following week minimal invasive resin composite veneers were implemented on upper incisors and canines. In the next appointment, finishing and polishing were performed with abrasive discs and silicon carbide brushes.

5000|$|The {{clothing}} {{issued in}} 1808 was obviously {{in the style}} of the light dragoons. Its [...] "complete suits" [...] included helmets, a pelisse like the hussars', and boots. Stable dress included a red stable shirt, trousers, shoes with laces. The guides were described in 1813 Francis Larpent as dressed [...] "in scarlet jackets looking more regular than most Spanish regulars and not unlike our own volunteer yeomanry cavalry with an air of consequence". This certainly indicates that the style was indeed that of the light dragoons before 1812-1813, featuring the tarleton helmet and the jacket trimmed with cords. It would also seem to indicate that the <b>guides</b> <b>wore</b> the colours of the British Quartermaster-General's Department: scarlet faced with blue, with white or silver buttons and lace.|$|R

5000|$|Longevity, as {{demonstrated}} in early automotive applications of the Knight engine. Prior to the advent of leaded gasolines, poppet-valve engines typically required grinding of the valves and valve seats after 20,000 to 30,000 miles (32,000 to 48,000 km) of service. Sleeve valves did not suffer from the wear and recession caused by the repetitive impact of the poppet valve against its seat. Sleeve valves were also subjected to less intense heat build-up than poppet valves, owing to their greater area of contact with other metal surfaces. In the Knight engine, carbon build-up actually helped to improve the sealing of the sleeves, the engines being said to [...] "improve with use", in contrast to poppet valve engines, which lose compression and power as valves, valve stems and <b>guides</b> <b>wear.</b> Due to the continuous motion of the sleeve (Burt-McCollum type), the high wear points linked to poor lubrication in the TDC/BDC (bottom dead centre) of piston travel within the cylinder are suppressed, so rings and cylinders lasted much longer.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: This study {{approaches}} {{the process of}} teaching-learning {{of a group of}} occupational therapy students to act in the care of mothers of babies at risk in the hospital context. It is linked to a community project, supported by the ‘Programa de Extensao Universitaria’. Objective: It aimed to qualify the students for understanding the risk rising, the initial mother-baby bond in the hospital environment, the monitoring of the child development and troubleshooting, as well as to see themselves as subjects of their own training. Method: Participants were six students, three teachers, 26 mothers and their 28 babies. The procedures had been developed in three articulated axles: practice, theoretical basis and invitation to reflection, each <b>axle</b> <b>guided</b> by one of three teachers. There were 65 meetings; 27 of the group of mothers, 11 of the group for theoretical overviews and 27 of the reflection group. Six students have completed their participation in the study, having achieved qualification for the care of occupational therapy to mothers of babies at risk during hospitalization and at home after discharge, as well as the co-responsibility with people and served family. All 26 mothers received care in the nursery; 25 of them in addition to the nursery, were treated at mothers group and 6 in addition to the nursery and the group, were visited at home. Conclusion: This study made it possible to contemplate two subjects with the same priority: the mother and her baby, as subjects of the attention and care of an occupational therapist and the student, as the subject of the attention and care of the teacher of occupational therapy...|$|R
