5000|$|A {{rather more}} {{cumbersome}} interrupter was {{constructed by the}} American Charles Page slightly earlier in 1838 but Bird's work was entirely independent. Although there is little in common between the two interrupter designs, Page takes the credit for being {{the first to use}} permanent magnets in an <b>automatic</b> <b>interrupter</b> circuit. Bird's (and Page's) interrupter had the medically disadvantageous feature that current was supplied in opposite directions during the make and break operations, although the current was substantially less during the make operation than the break (current is only supplied at all while the switch is dynamically changing). Treatment often required that current was supplied in one specified direction only.|$|R

50|$|Letheby {{designed}} an interrupter circuit for {{use with}} induction coils for the medical application of electricity. The function of an interrupter circuit is to continually make and break the supply to the induction coil, which causes the coil to generate a large back emf at its output each time it is switched. Early interrupters were operated by hand, but Golding Bird introduced an <b>automatic</b> <b>interrupter</b> which worked electromagnetically in 1838. The problem with Bird's interrupter, and the problem that Letheby wished to solve, was that the direction of flow of the electric current was in opposite directions during the make and the break operations. Medical applications of electricity often required a unidirectional current, particularly when treating nervous disorders. Letheby's design caused only either the make or the break current to flow to the patient by a mechanical arrangement of two spoked wheels. Letherby proposed that a further advantage of his machine was that the pulses from the make contact provided a rather lesser shock to the patient than the pulses from the break contact. This gave the physician some control in situation where large shocks were not needed.|$|R

25|$|A general {{inability}} to control affective states may impair the conditioning of behaviour associated with rewards and punishment, may increase susceptibility to biasing by substance-related cues, and could tax self-regulatory capacity. Such conditions may render individuals unable to <b>interrupt</b> <b>automatic</b> drug-seeking behaviours. Abnormal levels {{of positive and}} negative affect can be increased by low effortful control. For example, high positive affect may interact with low effortful control in increasing risk of addiction amongst vulnerable populations.|$|R

5000|$|Michael Faraday {{discovered}} {{the principle of}} induction, Faraday's induction law, in 1831 and did the first experiments with induction between coils of wire. [...] The induction coil was invented by the American physician Charles Grafton Page in 1836 [...] and, later on, independently by Irish scientist and Catholic priest Nicholas Callan {{in the same year}} at the St. Patrick's College, Maynooth and improved by William Sturgeon and Charles Grafton Page. George Henry Bachhoffner and Sturgeon (1837) independently discovered that a [...] "divided" [...] iron core of iron wires reduced power losses. [...] The early coils had hand cranked interrupters, invented by Callan and Antoine Philibert Masson (1837). [...] The <b>automatic</b> 'hammer' <b>interrupter</b> was invented by Rev. Prof. James William MacGauley (1838) of Dublin, Ireland, [...] Johann Philipp Wagner (1839), and Christian Ernst Neeff (1847). [...] Hippolyte Fizeau (1853) introduced the use of the quenching capacitor. [...] Heinrich Ruhmkorff generated higher voltages by greatly increasing the length of the secondary, in some coils using 5 or 6 miles (10 km) of wire and produced sparks up to 16 inches. In the early 1850s, American inventor Edward Samuel Ritchie introduced the divided secondary construction to improve insulation. [...] Jonathan Nash Hearder worked on induction coils. Callan's induction coil was named an IEEE Milestone in 2006.|$|R
40|$|The RAMOS {{operating}} system {{is capable of}} handling up to 72 simultaneous tasks in an interrupt-driven environment. The minimum viable hardware configuration includes a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP- 15 computer with 16384 words of memory, extended arithmetic element, <b>automatic</b> priority <b>interrupt,</b> a 256 K-word RS 09 DECdisk, two DECtape transports, and an alphanumeric keyboard/ typer. The monitor executes major tasks by loading disk-resident modules to memory for execution; modules are written in a format that allows page-relocation by the monitor, and can be loaded into any available page. All requests for monitor service by tasks, including input/output, floating point arithmetic, request for additional memory, task initiation, etc., are implemented by privileged monitor calls (CAL). All IO device handlers are capable of queuing requests for service, allowing several tasks ''simultaneous'' use of all resources. All alphanumeric IO (including the PC 05) is completely buffered and handled by a single multiplexing routine. The floating point arithmetic software is re-entrant to all operating modules and includes matrix arithmetic functions. One of the system tasks can be a ''batch'' job, controlled by simulating an alphanumeric command terminal through cooperative functions of the disk handler and alphanumeric device software. An alphanumeric control sequence may be executed, automatically accessing disk-resident tasks in any prescribed order; a library of control sequences is maintained on bulk storage for access by the monitor.

[...] University of Washington, 2016 - 05 In {{line with}} the recent {{interest}} {{on the benefits of}} mindfulness by the popular media and industry leaders alike, mindfulness research and its effects on performance has also begun to flourish. Nonetheless, most previous research focused on mindfulness’s direct, positive relationship with performance. Therefore, in this dissertation, I explored boundary conditions of this relationship by understanding how mindfulness can <b>interrupt</b> <b>automatic</b> cognitive processes following positive and negative affective events (i. e., self-serving causal attributions), which can either positively or negatively affect performance, depending on the valence of the event. Specifically, I examined how mindfulness’s purported attenuation of self-serving bias can result in both increased and decreased levels of performance via repetitive thinking characteristics related to the affective event. Finally, I tested the full theoretical model with three studies. Study 1 was an experiment, which manipulated the affective event to examine its impact on causal attributions, repetitive thinking characteristics, and changes in performance. Study 2 was the same experiment as Study 1, but also included manipulations of both the affective event and participants’ states of mindfulness. Finally, Study 3 involved a one-week long field experiment, which utilized experience sampling methodology to understand these effects at the intra-individual level. Results from these studies lend preliminary support to the proposition that affective events may be a boundary condition of mindfulness’s relationship with task performance in that it is potentially beneficial to performance during negative events and detrimental to performance during positive events.

40|$|Neuroeconomics uses {{knowledge}} about brain mechanisms to inform economic analysis, and roots economics in biology. It {{opens up the}} "black box" of the brain, much as organizational economics adds detail {{to the theory of}} the firm. Neuroscientists use many tools— including brain imaging, behavior of patients with localized brain lesions, animal behavior, and recording single neuron activity. The key insight for economics is that the brain is composed of multiple systems which interact. Controlled systems ("executive function") <b>interrupt</b> <b>automatic</b> ones. Emotions and cognition both guide decisions. Just as prices and allocations emerge from the interaction of two processes—supply and demand— individual decisions can be modeled as the result of two (or more) processes interacting. Indeed, "dual-process" models of this sort are better rooted in neuroscientific fact, and more empirically accurate, than single-process models (such as utility-maximization). We discuss how brain evidence complicates standard assumptions about basic preference, to include homeostasis and other kinds of state-dependence. We also discuss applications to intertemporal choice, risk and decision making, and game theory. Intertemporal choice appears to be domain-specific and heavily influenced by emotion. The simplified ß-d of quasi-hyperbolic discounting is supported by activation in distinct regions of limbic and cortical systems. In risky decision, imaging data tentatively support the idea that gains and losses are coded separately, and that ambiguity is distinct from risk, because it activates fear and discomfort regions. (Ironically, lesion patients who do not receive fear signals in prefrontal cortex are "rationally" neutral toward ambiguity.) Game theory studies show the effect of brain regions implicated in "theory of mind", correlates of strategic skill, and effects of hormones and other biological variables. Finally, economics can contribute to neuroscience because simple rational-choice models are useful for understanding highly-evolved behavior like motor actions that earn rewards, and Bayesian integration of sensorimotor information. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{represent}} {{numbers in}} space, along a ‘mental number line’ that runs left to right, small to large, associating small numbers {{with the left}} and large numbers with the right. The behavioural demonstration {{of this has been}} termed the SNARC effect (spatial-numerical association of response codes). Individuals have typically worked alone to complete the tasks used to elicit the SNARC effect. Participants have also completed the task in pairs, sitting alongside one another, taking turns to respond. As a result, a ‘joint SNARC effect’ was revealed, suggesting that each person in the pair represented the potential actions of their partner in a similar way to which they represented their own actions. This thesis examines a new joint action situation, with pairs now seated opposite one another. I hypothesised that if people sitting opposite one another represent their partner’s potential actions in a functionally similar way to their own, the conflicting left-to-right orientations will <b>interrupt</b> <b>automatic</b> attentional shifts, lessening the typical SNARC effect. I modified a previously used target detection task (Fischer et al., 2003) so that it could be shared between two people working opposite one another. Reaction times (RTs) were recorded and examined in two experiments; (1) working alone to complete the new task and (2) working in pairs. Results revealed that as hypothesised, individuals did not show the SNARC effect in experiment 2 when working jointly with an opposite other. However, individuals did not demonstrate the effect when working alone in experiment 1. This inability to replicate previous findings when individuals complete a SNARC task alone restricts the interpretation of experiment 2 results. In addition, in experiment 2, participant’s self-reported level of empathy was also measured. It was hypothesised that those low in empathy would be more likely than those high in empathy to demonstrate the SNARC effect, as research suggests they would be less affected by the opposing perspective of their partner. This pattern emerged both when the participants completed the task in the presence of another person and when participants worked jointly with another...|$|R
40|$|Masked prime tasks {{have shown}} that sensory {{information}} {{that has not been}} consciously perceived can nevertheless trigger the preactivation of a motor response. Automatic inhibitory control processes prevent such response tendencies from interfering with behaviour. The present study investigated the possibility that these inhibitory control processes are mediated by a cortico-striatal-pallidal-thalamic pathway by using a masked prime task with Huntington's disease patients (Experiment 1) and with healthy volunteers in a functional MRI (fMRI) study (Experiment 2). In the masked prime task, clearly visible left- or right-pointing target arrows are preceded by briefly presented and subsequently masked prime arrows. Participants respond quickly with a left or right key-press to each target. Trials are either compatible (prime and target pointing in the same direction) or incompatible (prime and target pointing in different directions). Prior behavioural and electrophysiological results show that automatic inhibition of the initially primed response tendency is reflected in a 'negative compatibility effect' (faster reaction times for incompatible trials than for compatible trials), and is shown to consist of three distinct processes (prime activation, response inhibition and response conflict) occurring within 300 ms. Experiment 1 tested the hypothesis that lesions of the striatum would <b>interrupt</b> <b>automatic</b> inhibitory control by studying early-stage Huntington's disease patients. Findings supported the hypothesis: there was a bimodal distribution for patients, with one-third (choreic) showing disinhibition, manifested as an absent negative compatibility effect, and two-thirds (non-choreic) showing excessive inhibition, manifested as a significantly greater negative compatibility effect than that in controls. Experiment 2 used fMRI and a region of interest (ROI) template-based method to further test the hypothesis that structures of the striatal-pallidal-thalamic pathway mediate {{one or more of the}} processes of automatic inhibitory control. Neither prime activation nor response conflict significantly engaged any ROIs, but the response inhibition process led to significant modulation of both the caudate and thalamus. Taken together, these experiments indicate a causal role for the caudate nucleus and thalamus in automatic inhibitory motor control, and the results are consistent with performance of the task requiring both direct and indirect striatal-pallidal-thalamic pathways. The finding that Huntington's disease patients with greater chorea were disinhibited is consistent with the theory that chorea arises from selective degeneration of striatal projections to the lateral globus pallidus, while the exaggerated inhibitory effect for patients with little or no chorea may be due to additional degeneration of projections to the medial globus pallidus. ...|$|R
