25|$|During {{exocytosis}} at the bipolar ribbon synapse, vesicles {{are seen}} to pause at the membrane and then upon opening of the calcium channels to promptly release their contents within milliseconds. Like most exocytosis, Ca2+ regulates the release of vesicles from the presynaptic membrane. Different types of ribbon synapses have different dependence on Ca2+ releases. The hair cell ribbon synapses exhibit a steep dependence on Ca2+ concentration, while the photoreceptor synapses is less steeply dependent on Ca2+ and is stimulated by much lower levels of free Ca2+. The hair cell ribbon synapse experiences spontaneous activity {{in the absence of}} stimuli, under conditions of a constant hair cell membrane potential. Voltage clamp at the postsynaptic bouton showed that the bouton experiences a wide range of excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes. The current <b>amplitude</b> <b>distribution</b> is a positive-skew, with a range of larger amplitudes for both spontaneous and stimulus evoked release. It was thought that this current distribution was not explainable with single vesicle release, and other scenarios of release have been proposed: coordinated multivesicular release, kiss-and-run, or compound fusion of vesicles prior to exocytosis. However it has been recently proposed that uniquantal release with fusion pore flickering is the most plausible interpretation of the found current distribution. In fact, the charge distribution of currents is actually normally distributed, supporting the uniquantal release scenario. It has been shown that the skewness of the current <b>amplitude</b> <b>distribution</b> is well explained by different time courses of neurotransmitter release of a single vesicles with a flickering fusion pore.|$|E

40|$|Saccadic {{endpoint}} variability {{is often}} viewed as the outcome of neural noise occurring during sensorimotor processing. However, part of this variability might result from operant learning. We tested this hypothesis by reinforcing dispersions of saccadic <b>amplitude</b> <b>distributions,</b> while maintaining constant their medians. In a first experiment we reinforced the least frequent saccadic amplitudes to increase variability, and then reinforced {{the central part of}} the <b>amplitude</b> <b>distributions</b> to reduce variability. The target was placed at a constant distance from the fovea after the saccade to maintain the postsaccadic visual signal constant and an auditory reinforcement was delivered depending on saccadic amplitude. The second experiment tested the effects of the contingency. We reinforced high levels of variability in 4 participants, whereas 4 other participants were assigned to a yoked control group. On average, saccadic amplitude standard deviations were doubled while the medians remained mostly unchanged in the experimental participants in both experiments, and variability returned to baseline level when low variability was reinforced. In the control group no consistent changes in <b>amplitude</b> <b>distributions</b> were observed. These results, showing that variability can be reinforced, challenge the idea of a stochastic neural noise. We instead propose that selection processes constrain saccadic <b>amplitude</b> <b>distributions...</b>|$|R

The analysis allows one to ascertain, in some cases, whether a b-value calculated from a measured distribution was modified by attenuation. The procedure can be theoretically reversed in order to estimate the original distribution (at the source) from the recorded istri-bution. However, in practice, lack of precision on attenuation coefficients and source radii makes it difficult to perform...|$|R

Methods: In the basis of researches lies the processing and analysis of interconnection experimental acoustic emission signals parameter, which one appear at composite material machining, with treating tool wear. The acoustic emission at initial and final stage of composite material machining are esteemed. The statistical processing of acoustic emission amplitude parameters on these stages was conducted. The statistical data processing with the analysis regularity change of acoustic emission signals <b>amplitudes</b> <b>distribution</b> kurtosis is conducted. Results: Is determined, that the increase of composite material machining time does not result in change of acoustic radiation nature. The registered acoustic emission signals are continuous signals. Is established, that at composite material machining final stage is watched decreasing of acoustic emission signal amplitude average level and value of its deviation. Is determined, that the gradual or instantaneous increase of treating tool wear results in its destruction and sharp decreasing of acoustic emission signal amplitude. The regularity change of acoustic emission signals <b>amplitudes</b> <b>distribution</b> kurtosis at all stages of composite material machining is established. Discussion: The analysis of acoustic emission statistical amplitude parameters change at initial and final stage composite material machining is conducted. Decreasing of acoustic emission statistical amplitude parameters at final stage of machining is shown, that is conditioned by treating tool wear. It is shown, that originating and development of treating tool wearing up to an instant of its damage results in minor decreasing of acoustic emission signal amplitude average level. At the same, at early stage, which one will precede to tool damage, there is a discontinuous of acoustic emission signals <b>amplitudes</b> <b>distribution</b> kurtosis change from stable positive value up to negative value.
