The art gallery Kunstnernes Hus by Gudolf Blakstad and Herman Munthe-Kaas (1930) still shows influence from the preceding classicist trend of the 1920s. Hvalstrand bath (1934) is one of several public seaside bath facilities in Norway, by André Peters. A year before, Ingierstrand Bad was designed by Ole Lind Schistad (1891-1979) and Eivind Moestue(1893 -1977).

40|$|BACKGROUND: This was a {{retrospective}} {{review of the}} long-term results of femorotibial bypass using autologous vein and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) over 24 years. METHODS: Some 518 patients who underwent 635 femorotibial bypass grafts were studied. Outcome measures analysed included primary and secondary graft patency, limb salvage rates and death. RESULTS: Overall primary and secondary graft patencies were 62 <b>and</b> 67 <b>per</b> cent respectively at 12 months, and 44 <b>and</b> 48 <b>per</b> cent at 24 months. For vein grafts, the primary and secondary patencies were 63 <b>and</b> 66 <b>per</b> cent at 12 months, and 54 <b>and</b> 56 <b>per</b> cent at 24 months. For PTFE grafts, the primary and secondary patencies were 48 <b>and</b> 54 <b>per</b> cent at 12 months, and 31 <b>and</b> 37 <b>per</b> cent at 24 months. Limb salvage and patient survival rates were 81 <b>and</b> 84 <b>per</b> cent at 12 months, and 73 <b>and</b> 74 <b>per</b> cent at 24 months. Primary and secondary graft patencies for vein were significantly better than for PTFE (P = 0. 0001). There {{was no difference in}} patency between reversed and in situ grafts. CONCLUSION: Femorotibial bypass can produce excellent long-term results. Vein remains the conduit of choice but in the absence of vein acceptable results can be achieved with PTFE.

Nonetheless, resulting from forced migration, there was a rapid increase in population to 23.9 million shown in the first post-war census of 14 February 1946. The Polish state acquired more highly developed western territories and lost the more economically backward eastern regions.

Tsingtao (Qingdao) was its administrative center. After the farmers and fishermen of the Chinese village sold their buildings and land and resettled in the rural communities further east, the Germans began to develop the area. Wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply were improvements that transformed the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao into a modern German town.

It became a part of the Soviet sphere of influence under the leadership of Georgi Dimitrov (1946–1949), who laid the foundations for a rapidly industrialising Stalinist state which was also highly repressive with thousands of dissidents executed. By the mid-1950s standards of living rose significantly, while political repressions were lessened. By the 1980s both national <b>and</b> <b>per</b> capita GDPs quadrupled, but the economy remained prone to debt spikes, the most severe taking place in 1960, 1977 and 1980. The Soviet-style planned economy saw some market-oriented policies emerging on an experimental level under Todor Zhivkov (1954–1989). His daughter Lyudmila bolstered national pride by promoting Bulgarian heritage, culture and arts worldwide. In an attempt to erase the identity of the ethnic Turk minority, an assimilation campaign was launched in 1984 which included closing mosques and forcing ethnic Turks to adopt Slavic names. These policies (combined with the end of communist rule in 1989) resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 ethnic Turks to Turkey.|$|E
