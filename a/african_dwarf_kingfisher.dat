50|$|The {{subfamily}} includes 35 species {{divided into}} four genera. The <b>African</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>kingfisher</b> is sometimes placed in the monotypic genus Myioceyx, and sometimes with the pygmy kingfishers in Ispidina. Molecular analysis suggests that the Madagascan pygmy kingfisher is most {{closely related to the}} malachite kingfisher.|$|E
5000|$|The little {{kingfisher}} is [...] {{long with}} a rich blue back and head and a snowy white breast. It has a heavy bill and has a short tail. This {{is one of the}} smallest kingfishers in the world. Only the <b>African</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>kingfisher</b> is smaller.|$|E
50|$|These similar small kingfishers can be {{distinguished}} by the blue crown of the African pigmy kingfisher. They have different habit preferences and have mostly non-overlapping ranges. The slightly smaller <b>African</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>kingfisher</b> occurs in tropical rainforests while the African pygmy kingfisher occurs in dry grassy woodland.|$|E

50|$|This {{species was}} {{formerly}} {{considered as one}} of the 15 recognised subspecies of what was then known as the variable <b>dwarf</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Ceyx lepidus or Alcedo lepidus). A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2013 found that most of the insular subspecies had substantially diverged from one another. The variable <b>dwarf</b> <b>kingfisher</b> was therefore split and 12 of the subspecies, including the Buru <b>dwarf</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> were promoted to species status. At the same time the name of the variable <b>dwarf</b> <b>kingfisher</b> was changed to the Moluccan <b>dwarf</b> <b>kingfisher.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>{{kingfisher}}</b> (Ispidina lecontei) is {{a species}} of kingfisher in the Alcedininae subfamily.

50|$|The first formal {{description}} of the <b>African</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>kingfisher</b> was by the American ornithologist John Cassin in 1856.

This is the world's smallest kingfisher with a length of 10 cm and a weight of 9 - 12 g.|$|E
5000|$|The African pygmy {{kingfisher}} is [...] in length. The sexes are alike. It {{is very small}} kingfisher with rufous underparts and a blue back extending down to the tail. The dark blue crown of the adult separates it from the <b>African</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>kingfisher.</b> The smaller size and violet wash on the ear coverts distinguish it from the similar malachite kingfisher.|$|E
