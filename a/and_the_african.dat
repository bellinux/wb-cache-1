5|$|Crex {{is a small}} genus {{of birds}} in the rail family. It {{contains}} two species, the corn crake, C. crex, which breeds across Europe and Asia and winters in southern Africa, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> crake, C. egregia, which migrates within Africa. Both are short-billed rails with blackish-brown upperparts, mainly blue-grey underparts, and barring on the flanks. The corn crake is significantly larger than its relative, and has a distinctive chestnut patch on its wings. Unusually for their family, these are birds of dry habitats rather than wetlands; the Eurasian species mainly breeds in hay meadows, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> crake in dry grassland. The African crake is sometimes given its own genus, Crecopsis, but is now more usually placed in Crex.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 a major DNA {{study of}} golden jackals {{concluded}} that the six C.aureus subspecies found in Africa should be reclassified under the new species C.anthus (African golden wolf), {{reducing the number of}} golden jackal subspecies to seven. The phylogenetic tree generated from this study shows the golden jackal diverging from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9million years ago <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> golden wolf diverging 1.3million years ago. The study found that the golden jackal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> golden wolf shared a very similar skull and body morphology and that this had confused taxonomists into regarding these as one species. The study proposes that the very similar skull and body morphology is due to both species having originated from a larger common ancestor.|$|E

Then, Porky <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> approach a sour-pussed caricature of Spencer Tracy named Stanley. Stanley presumes that Porky is Dr. Livingstone, but Porky tells him his name.

5|$|A lull ensued, {{during which}} November talks {{sponsored}} by the OAU failed to conciliate the opposing Chadian factions.

Mengistu's failure was followed on 24 January by a GUNT attack, supported by heavy Libyan armor, on the FANT outpost of Ziguey, a move mainly meant to persuade France <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> states to reopen negotiations. France reacted to this breach of the Red Line by launching the first significant air counter-attack, bringing new troops into Chad and unilaterally raising the defensive line to the 16th parallel.|$|E
5|$|A subfamily, the Diplodocinae, {{was erected}} to include Diplodocus and its closest relatives, {{including}} Barosaurus.

The Portuguese Dinheirosaurus <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Tornieria have also been identified as close relatives of Diplodocus by some authors. The Diplodocoidea comprise the diplodocids, as well as dicraeosaurids, rebbachisaurids, Suuwassea, Amphicoelias and possibly Haplocanthosaurus, and/or the nemegtosaurids. This clade is the sister group to Macronaria (camarasaurids, brachiosaurids and titanosaurians).|$|E

Despite this, the majority of South Africa's sporting organisations stopped awarding Springbok colours following the replacement of the Springbok by the Protea following a government demand. The only sporting body in South Africa that was allowed to retain Springbok colours was the South African Rugby Union as an act of conciliation towards the white minority who made up the majority of the national rugby union team.|$|E

5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} of the serval {{have remained in}} dispute; in 1997, palaeontologists M.C. McKenna and S.K. Bell classified Leptailurus as a subgenus of Felis, while others like O.R.P. Bininda-Edmonds (of the Technical University of Munich) have grouped it with Felis, Lynx and Caracal. Studies in the 2000s and the 2010s show that the serval, along with the caracal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> golden cat, forms {{one of the eight}} lineages of Felidae. According to a 2006 genetic study, the Caracal lineage came into existence 8.5mya, and the ancestor of this lineage arrived in Africa 8.5â€“5.6mya.|$|E

5|$|Another {{international}} {{problem was}} the slave trade, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> squadron was formed in 1820 {{to deal with this}} threat. Politically, the suppression of the slave trade was unpopular, and the squadron was withdrawn in 1823 ostensibly to deal with piracy in the Caribbean, and did not return to the African coast until the passage of the Websterâ€“Ashburton treaty with Britain in 1842. After the treaty was passed, the United States used fewer ships than the treaty required, ordered the ships based far from the coast of Africa, and used ships that were too large to operate close to shore. Between 1845 and 1850, the United States Navy captured only 10 slave vessels, while the British captured 423 vessels carrying 27,000 captives.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} {{appearance}} of the dire wolf, North America was invaded by the genus Xenocyon (ancestor of the Asian dhole <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> hunting dog) that was as large as the dire wolf and more hypercarnivorous. The fossil record shows them as rare, and it is assumed that they could not compete with the newly derived dire wolf. Stable isotope analysis provides evidence that the dire wolf, Smilodon, and the American lion competed for the same prey. Other large carnivores included the extinct North American giant short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), the modern cougar (Puma concolor), the Pleistocene coyote (Canis latrans), and the Pleistocene gray wolf that was more massive and robust than today. These predators may have competed with humans who hunted for similar prey.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 Zambian census was {{conducted}} in Zambia in 2010 under {{the approval of the}} Government of Zambia, which recorded demographic data from 13 million people and 3.2 million households.

It was the fifth national population census exercise of Zambia since its independence in 1964, with the previous censuses conducted in 1969, 1980, 1990 and 2000. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used for data collection and the processing started in April 2011 by the Central Statistical Office. Optical Mark Reading (OMR) and Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) technology were used for data capture. The census was funded by United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Kingdom AID (UKAID-formerly DFID), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Development Bank (AfDB), who contributed close to 60 per cent of the total expenditure and rest contributed by the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Zambia.|$|E

5|$|The {{ancestor}} {{of the golden}} jackal {{is believed to be}} the extinct Arno river dog that lived in Mediterranean Europe 1.9million years ago. It is described as being a small, jackal-like canine. Genetic studies indicate that the golden jackal expanded from India at the end of the last ice age around 20,000 years ago. The oldest golden jackal fossil is 20,000 years old and was found at the Ksar Akil rock shelter near Beirut, Lebanon. The oldest golden jackal fossils in Europe were found in Greece and are 7,000 years old. There are seven subspecies of the golden jackal. The golden jackal is not closely related to the African black-backed or side-striped jackals, being instead more closely related to the gray wolf, coyote, African golden wolf, and Ethiopian wolf. It is capable of producing fertile hybrids with both the gray wolf <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> golden wolf. Dog-jackal hybrids called Sulimov dogs are in service at the Sheremetyevo Airport near Moscow where they are deployed by the Russian airline Aeroflot for scent-detection.|$|E
5|$|The area of Africa {{now known}} as Malawi was settled by {{migrating}} Bantu groups around the 10th century. Centuries later in 1891 the area was colonised by the British. In 1953 Malawi, then known as Nyasaland, a protectorate of the United Kingdom, became a protectorate within the semi-independent Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The Federation was dissolved in 1963. In 1964 the protectorate over Nyasaland was ended and Nyasaland became an independent country under Queen Elizabeth II with the new name Malawi. Two years later it became a republic. Upon gaining independence it became a one-party state under the presidency of Hastings Banda, who remained president until 1994, when he lost an election. Arthur Peter Mutharika is the current president. Malawi has a democratic, multi-party government. The country has a Malawian Defence Force that includes an army, a navy and an air wing. Malawi's foreign policy is pro-Western and includes positive diplomatic relations with most countries and participation in several international organisations, including the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Union (AU).|$|E
