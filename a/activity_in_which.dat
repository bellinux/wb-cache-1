5|$|Ninth Army {{eventually}} evacuated {{the salient}} in Operation Buffalo (Büffel) in March 1943, {{as part of}} a general shortening of the line. Large-scale anti-partisan sweeps were carried out in the weeks before the operation (the army's sector was a hotbed for partisan <b>activity),</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> an estimated 3,000 Russians were killed, the great majority of whom were unarmed, as shown by the inventory of the seized weapons: 277 rifles, 41 pistols, 61 machine guns, 17 mortars, 9 antitank rifles and 16 small artillery pieces. The withdrawal itself took two weeks, with minimal casualties or disruption in a move of an Army group numbering approximately 300,000 men, 100 tanks and 400 artillery pieces. In its wake, Model personally ordered the deportation of all male civilians, wells poisoned, and at least two dozen villages razed in a scorched earth policy to hinder the Red Army's follow up in the area.|$|E

In 1990 he received a David di Donatello career award. In 1992, after having first accepted to be a candidate at the elections with the Pannella List, he withdrawn the candidature to not give up his artistic commitments. In 1993, during the shooting of Un commissario a Roma, he suffered a hypoxia which compromised his memory functions.

25|$|While still a Democrat, {{she and her}} then-fiancé Marcus were {{inspired}} to join the pro-life movement by Francis Schaeffer's 1976 Christian documentary film How Should We Then Live? They prayed outside of clinics and engaged in sidewalk counseling, a pro-life protest <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> activists approach people entering abortion clinics {{in an attempt to}} dissuade women from obtaining abortions. Since then, Bachmann has made statements supportive of sidewalk counseling. Bachmann was a supporter of Jimmy Carter in 1976, and she and her husband worked on his campaign. During Carter's presidency, Bachmann became disappointed with his liberal approach to public policy, support for legalized abortion and economic decisions she held responsible for increased gas prices. In the 1980 presidential election, she voted for Ronald Reagan and worked for his campaign.|$|E
25|$|In {{analogy with}} Thomas Kuhn's {{definition}} of a scientific paradigm, Dosi has defined a technological paradigm as the general outlook on the productive problems faced by firms. As such, a technological paradigm is composed by some sort of model of the technology at stake (e.g. the model of a microprocessor) and by the specific technological problems posed by such model (e.g. increasing computational capacity, reducing dimensions, etc.). Therefore, technology is identified as a problem-solving <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the problems to be solved are selected by the paradigm itself. In this sense, a technological paradigm entails strong prescriptions on the direction of technological change, that is the direction toward which future technical improvements will converge. Such gradual improvements along the specific lines prescribed by the paradigm are what constitute technological trajectories and progress.|$|E
25|$|In this study, {{participants}} {{were assigned to}} one of two conditions. In the first condition they would be paired with a computer and would become the blue team. The computer had a blue sticker and the human wore a blue wristband to signify that they were in fact a team. The second condition was blue individual, in which a person would use a computer but they were not considered teammates, rather the computer was just a resource. The task was to complete a “Desert Survival Guide” <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> participants rank items they deem most important if they were left on a deserted island. Human participants initially completed the activity on their own and then completed it using a computer (either as a teammate where both the computer and human were evaluated or just using the computer as a resource). Finally, the {{participants were}} allowed to revise their rankings, if they wished to do so. The results of this study indicated that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate viewed the computer as more like them, worked in a similar style to their own, was more cooperative and friendlier than people who worked individually. Another finding of this study showed that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate were more likely to change their behavior and conform to the group ideal even when the teammate was a computer. This study supports the notion that developing a sense of interdependency is the key to establishing team affiliation.|$|E

500|$|In some countries, it is a legal, {{competitive}} <b>activity,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{dogs are}} tested {{on their ability}} to run, overtake and turn a hare, rather than a form of hunting aiming at the capture of game. It has a number of variations in its rules around the world. Informal coursing can be a form of hunting, conducted to kill game or vermin, either for food, pest control or as a pastime. [...] Coursing is a long established hunting technique, practiced historically with greyhounds, other sighthound breeds, or with lurchers which are crossbred sighthounds, and working breeds. The sport grew in popularity in Europe during the 19th century, but has since experienced a decline {{due in part to the}} introduction of greyhound racing with betting, and animal welfare legislation.|$|E
500|$|According to Woolverton, {{the story}} team {{challenged}} nearly every line of dialogue Woolverton suggested for the character. On one occasion, the story artists re-wrote what Woolverton had originally scripted as Belle using a map to indicate places {{to where she}} would like to travel to the character baking a cake. Arguing that the liberated Belle would not even know how to bake, Woolverton decided to compromise by having the character read a book instead, which was similarly debated because some filmmakers considered reading to be too passive an activity. To resolve this, Woolverton scripted Belle walk while reading, an <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Woolverton herself partook as a child. In Beaumont's fairy tale, Belle is essentially forced to replace her father as the Beast's prisoner. To make the character more independent, Woolverton re-wrote her so that she willingly ventures into the woods in search of her father, bravely confronts the Beast and ultimately trades her own freedom in return for Maurice's instead. During Gaston's climactic fight with the Beast, the character's line [...] "Time to die!" [...] was changed to [...] "Belle is mine!" [...] in order to return the focus of the story to Belle.|$|E
500|$|The Garbage Museum was an {{operating}} recycling facility and featured a viewing {{area for the}} operation which processes around 60,000 tons of recyclables from 20 local towns. Educational exhibits focused {{on the benefits of}} recycling drink cans and mining bauxite, the main source of aluminum, and reducing air pollution and water pollution. Another exhibit features a walk-through tunnel depicting a compost pile. Interactive exhibits included a general store and a [...] "Trash Bash" [...] <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> [...] "imprison helmet-wearing contestants ... answer questions. If the answer is wrong, others are given the green light to dump trash on them from an overhead opening." [...] There were also art exhibits made from recyclable material including a [...] "life-size mannequin made from crushed and colored milk containers strung together with pipe cleaners". In 2004, a new exhibit showcasing the trash-to-energy process was created by Mike Blasavage as part of a project funded by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority. The exhibit follows trash, represented as marbles, being transferred from bins to toy trucks, the trucks transfers the trash to the energy plant that generates energy to open and close a drawbridge.|$|E

500|$|A {{commonly}} used defence for the torts of trespass against {{the person is}} that of volenti non fit injuria, or consent. If a claimant participates in a sporting <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> physical contact is ordinary conduct, such as rugby, they are considered to have consented. This {{is not the case}} if the physical contact went beyond what could be expected, as in R v Billinghurst, or where the injuries were suffered not from the claimant's participation in the sport but inadequate safety measures taken, as in Watson v British Boxing Board of Control. The same general rule applies to people who voluntarily take part in fights, although only if the injuries caused are proportionate, as in Lane v Holloway. If the claimant is informed by a doctor of the broad risks of a medical procedure, there will be no claim under trespass against the person for resulting harm caused; the claimant's agreement constitutes [...] "real consent", as in Chatterton v Gerson. Consent for medical procedures is different in cases where the claimant does not have the mental capacity to consent. In F v West Berkshire Health Authority, it was held that in such situations the requirements are that there [...] "must be a necessity to act when it is not practical to communicate with the assisted person ... the action taken must be such as a reasonable person would in all the circumstances take, acting {{in the best interests of}} the assisted person".|$|E
