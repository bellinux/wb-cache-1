5|$|Climate can {{influence}} bat distribution, movements and biogeography, access to food resources, timing of reproduction and emergence {{and rate of}} energy expenditure. In combination with other factors, including ongoing loss and degradation of habitat, global climate change or global warming presents a serious and increasing threat to bats and other fauna. The affinity of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat for riparian zones in arid and semi-arid environments renders it potentially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} water stress <b>and</b> <b>extreme</b> weather events. Ecological factors that qualify the bristle-faced free-tailed bat as being at increased risk of the potential impacts of global climate change include habitat (species that rely on riparian habitats in water stress prone environments), foraging type (aerial hawking insectivore), roost type (tree hollow specialist), biogeography (species with limited dispersal ability, limited ranging behaviour) <b>and</b> <b>extreme</b> weather (species that occur in regions where there is an increasing risk of extreme temperature events or changes in rainfall patterns).|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{insights}} for assessing organizational resilience {{to the effects}} of climate change, specifically to climate <b>and</b> weather <b>extremes.</b> The assessment of organizational resilience to climate <b>and</b> weather <b>extremes</b> brings about several challenges due to (1) uncertainties about future climate change outcomes across temporal and spatial scales and (2) a lack of insight into what lead to organizational resilience, or which variables should be measured in a given study. We suggest methodological pathways for organizational managers to identify properties of future climate <b>and</b> weather <b>extremes</b> <b>and</b> to include them in resilience assessments. We also suggest approaches to identify factors that promote organizational resilience to selected climate <b>and</b> weather <b>extremes.</b> Findings are intended to help managers to understand how organizational resilience to climate <b>and</b> weather <b>extremes</b> can be enhanced...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{enhanced}} contrasts {{in winter}} (December‐January‐February) mean temperatures <b>and</b> <b>extremes</b> (cold southeast <b>and</b> warm northwest) across North America have triggered intensive discussion {{both within and}} outside of the scientific community, but the mechanisms responsible for these contrasts remain unresolved. Here we use a combination of observations and reanalysis data sets to show that the strengthened contrasts in winter mean temperatures <b>and</b> <b>extremes</b> across North America are closely related to an enhancement of the positive Pacific‐North American (PNA) pattern {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century. Recent intensification of positive PNA events is associated with amplified planetary waves over North America, driving cold‐air outbreaks into the southeast and warm tropical/subtropical air into the northwest. This not only results in a strengthened winter mean temperature contrast but increases the occurrence of the opposite‐signed extremes in these two regions.

Further relationships between multiscale temperature variability <b>and</b> temperature <b>extremes</b> over the past 49 years show that IVT is positively correlated with cold/warm nights (TN 10 /TN 90) and warm days (TX 90), whereas StdD is positively correlated with cold extremes (TN 10 /TX 10) and negatively correlated with warm extremes (TN 90 /TX 90).

5|$|Floods are {{the most}} common natural {{disaster}} in India. The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the Brahmaputra and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas.

Excess, erratic, or untimely monsoon rainfall may also wash away or otherwise ruin crops. Almost all of India is flood-prone, <b>and</b> <b>extreme</b> precipitation events, such as flash floods and torrential rains, have become increasingly common in central India over the past several decades, coinciding with rising temperatures. Mean annual precipitation totals have remained steady due to the declining frequency of weather systems that generate moderate amounts of rain.|$|E
