Whenever the player completes the required portions of one of the quest arcs they are allowed to begin the final <b>arc</b> and finish the game, even if the other arcs have not yet been started or completed.

5|$|Shielded metal <b>arc</b> welding (SMAW), {{also known}} as manual metal <b>arc</b> welding (MMA or MMAW), flux {{shielded}} <b>arc</b> welding or informally as stick welding, is a manual <b>arc</b> welding process that uses a consumable electrode covered with a flux to lay the weld.|$|E
5|$|Submerged <b>arc</b> welding (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} {{welding method}} {{in which the}} <b>arc</b> is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases <b>arc</b> quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other <b>arc</b> welding processes, since the flux hides the <b>arc</b> and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other <b>arc</b> welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud <b>arc</b> welding.|$|E

5|$|Weld spatter, {{while not}} {{affecting}} {{the integrity of}} the weld, damages its appearance and increases cleaning costs. It can be caused by excessively high current, a long <b>arc,</b> or <b>arc</b> blow, a condition associated with direct current characterized by the electric <b>arc</b> being deflected away from the weld pool by magnetic forces. <b>Arc</b> blow can also cause porosity in the weld, as can joint contamination, high welding speed, and a long welding <b>arc,</b> especially when low-hydrogen electrodes are used.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of the short pulsed electric <b>arc</b> in 1800 by Humphry Davy and of the continuous electric <b>arc</b> in 1802 by Vasily Petrov, there was little development in electrical welding until Auguste de Méritens developed a carbon <b>arc</b> torch that was patented in 1881.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal <b>arc</b> welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the <b>arc,</b> or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable <b>arc.</b>|$|E

5|$|During {{the middle}} of the century, many new welding methods were invented. In 1930, Kyle Taylor was {{responsible}} for the release of stud welding, which soon became popular in shipbuilding and construction. Submerged <b>arc</b> welding was invented the same year and continues to be popular today. In 1932 a Russian, Konstantin Khrenov successfully implemented the first underwater electric <b>arc</b> welding. Gas tungsten <b>arc</b> welding, after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941, and gas metal <b>arc</b> welding followed in 1948, allowing for fast welding of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases. Shielded metal <b>arc</b> welding was developed during the 1950s, using a flux-coated consumable electrode, and it quickly became the most popular metal <b>arc</b> welding process. In 1957, the flux-cored <b>arc</b> welding process debuted, in which the self-shielded wire electrode could be used with automatic equipment, resulting in greatly increased welding speeds, and that same year, plasma <b>arc</b> welding was invented. Electroslag welding was introduced in 1958, and it was followed by its cousin, electrogas welding, in 1961. In 1953, the Soviet scientist N. F. Kazakov proposed the diffusion bonding method.|$|E

5|$|For some {{of these}} processes, the {{presence}} of nitrogen or oxygen gases might cause defects within the material. Argon is used in some types of <b>arc</b> welding such as gas metal <b>arc</b> welding and gas tungsten <b>arc</b> welding, {{as well as in}} the processing of titanium and other reactive elements.

5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for <b>arc</b> spot welding, thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored <b>arc</b> welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal <b>arc</b> welding, flux cored <b>arc</b> welding, or gas tungsten <b>arc</b> welding.|$|E
5|$|GTAW is most {{commonly}} used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as shielded metal <b>arc</b> welding and gas metal <b>arc</b> welding, allowing for stronger, higher quality welds. However, GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques. A related process, plasma <b>arc</b> welding, uses a slightly different welding torch {{to create a more}} focused welding <b>arc</b> and as a result is often automated.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal <b>arc</b> welding can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric <b>arc,</b> welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric <b>arc</b> is a source of the condition known as <b>arc</b> eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric <b>arc.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} <b>arc</b> welding (GTAW), {{also known}} as tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is an <b>arc</b> welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas (argon or helium), and a filler metal is normally used, though some welds, known as autogenous welds, do not require it. A constant-current welding power supply produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the <b>arc</b> through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a plasma.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} <b>arc</b> welding is {{most commonly}} used to weld stainless steel and nonferrous materials, such as aluminum and magnesium, {{but it can be}} applied to nearly all metals, with a notable exception being zinc and its alloys. Its applications involving carbon steels are limited not because of process restrictions, but because of the existence of more economical steel welding techniques, such as gas metal <b>arc</b> welding and shielded metal <b>arc</b> welding. Furthermore, GTAW can be performed in a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on the skill of the welder and the materials being welded.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} <b>arc</b> welding uses {{a constant}} current power source, {{meaning that the}} current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the <b>arc</b> distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of GTAW are manual or semiautomatic, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady <b>arc</b> distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult.|$|E
