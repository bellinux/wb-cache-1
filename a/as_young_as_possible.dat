2500|$|Today, about a {{third of}} the region's {{production}} is sold as Beaujolais Nouveau, a marketing name created by George Duboeuf for the local vin de l'année. It is the lightest, fruitiest style of Beaujolais and meant for simple quaffing. Any Beaujolais or Beaujolais-Villages AOC vineyard can produce Beaujolais Nouveau. The grapes are harvested between late August and early September. It is fermented for just a few days and released to the public on the third Thursday of November - [...] "Beaujolais Nouveau Day". It is the first French wine to be released for each vintage year. In 1992, at its peak, more than half of all Beaujolais wine was sold as [...] "Beaujolais Nouveau". The wines are meant to be drunk <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> when they are at their freshest and fruitiest. They can last up to one or two years but will have lost most of their characteristic flavors by that point.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the basis of initial training {{is to make the}} experience enjoyable for the puppy or young hound, to keep its enthusiasm high. Whitney preferred waiting till the hound is 18 months old, to start training, but others start <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> say three months. Training can be started by running short trails on a family member whom the puppy sees walk away, at first remaining visible, and later going out of sight. Even though familiar with the scent of the ‘runner’, it can be given a scent-article to sniff, and given the command to follow. It can also be introduced to the tracking harness, which is put on just before the trail starts, and removed as soon as it is finished. On reaching the runner the puppy is given lavish praise and perhaps a reward. Generally in training the handler must know exactly where the runner went, so that he does not encourage the hound when it is wrong, or ‘correct’ it when it is on the scent, but he should not be too ready with his corrections if the hound goes astray, or it may come to rely on him. He should give the hound time to realise its mistake and put itself right, if possible. As training progresses the handler learns to ‘read’ his hound’s behaviour. The hound must trust its nose and the handler must trust the hound. From early hot trails on a familiar person, the young hound progresses to colder trails on the scents of strangers. Later training can be designed to teach particular lessons: crossing trails with false scents, having the runner start out with a companion, who leaves him somewhere along the trail, laying a trail on ground frequented by wild animals. This will teach the hound not to change on to other humans, or riot on animal scents (known as ‘staying clean’ , or ‘freedom from change’ [...] ). It also needs to work over a variety of ground and learn to cope with distractions of many kinds, as well as being introduced to 'negative trails': given a scent article which has not been handled by anyone in the area, so that it will learn to indicate to a handler that the required scent is not there. If it is becoming discouraged it can revert to simpler tasks to recover enthusiasm.|$|E

50|$|These two {{strategies}} {{have been adopted}} by the European and African bees respectively. European bees must survive the winter, an annual event with predictable mortality outcomes. Trying to meet the energetic needs of the colony and reproduction might decrease their overall survival during the winter and it is more evolutionarily favorable for them to store nectar and honey. African bees are more vulnerable to less predictable times of scarcity or attack and it is therefore to their advantage to produce <b>as</b> many <b>young</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> increasing the likelihood that some or even many will survive. Such circumstances would have favored the worker bees who preferred harvesting nectar in European colonies and pollen in African colonies, providing an explanation for how a divergence in worker behavior and age distribution evolved in Apis mellifera scutellata and Apis mellifera ligustica. Fewell and Bertram’s study is significant in that it provides a plausible method through which the fitness characteristics of the subspecies could have evolved from {{a small number of}} behavioral differences in worker bees.|$|R

50|$|The British Schools Karting Championship {{was set up}} in late 2003 as a {{means to}} promote karting to teenage school {{children}} in the United Kingdom.

The championship achieves this by providing all the karts for the young drivers to race on in what is known as 'arrive-and-drive' kart racing.

In this sense the championship differs significantly from the National Schools Karting Association (NatSKA) because schools competing in NatSKA are required to purchase and maintain their karts in order to race them.|$|R

50|$|Migratory {{birds are}} seriously {{affected}} by climate change because they cannot assess changes in spring weather from their wintering grounds. Higher spring temperatures {{can lead to}} earlier increases in insect abundance, but many bird species {{were not able to}} advance their arrival dates. For example, pied flycatchers used to time their egg hatch cycles with subsequent increases in food to raise <b>as</b> many <b>young</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> Spring migration based on day length had allowed flycatchers to arrive on time, and their egg laying times used to correlate with insect abundances. However, due to climate change, the flycatchers are now forced to lay eggs earlier, which leaves these birds not enough time to prepare their nests properly. Climate change poses a serious threat to long distance migrant birds because they arrive at inappropriate time to exploit environmental opportunities, and face higher competition with resident species. Birds such as the pied flycatcher can start nesting earlier, but their arrival time at the breeding grounds does not change because birds cannot remotely sense temperature changes on breeding grounds from their wintering grounds. The birds cannot depart their wintering grounds unless they have enough energy and fat reserves to support their migration journey, and since early arriving birds usually get the best resources, most species face intense competition for early arrival and early departure. For example, in American redstart, individuals with better phenotypic qualities arrive and mate first.|$|R

Attraction of a multitude of small animals (beetles, flies and other insects and their larvae, mites, nematodes, etc.) to the mushrooms bring in further sources of microbial contamination and very much enhances the problem.

Studies {{are needed}} to better {{understand}} the broad autism phenotype in young siblings of children with autism, and to identify areas of impairment, so that interventions can begin at <b>as</b> <b>young</b> an age <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> Method. Multiple measures were used to examine cognitive, adaptive, social communication, social-emotional functioning, imitation, play, and language abilities in 42 non-autistic siblings and 20 toddlers with no family history of autism, ages 18 - 27 months. Results. Siblings had lower mean receptive language and adaptive behavior skills, lower overall rates of social communication and social-emotional functioning, and used fewer words, distal gestures, responsive social smiles, and pointing during social interactions. Additionally, parents reported social impairments in siblings by 13 months of age. In other domains, such as imitation and play, siblings performed similarly to controls. Conclusions. These results suggest that certain aspects of language and social communication are affected at an early age in young non-autistic siblings. As such, the development of such children should be closely monitored by parents and professionals, with appropriate interventions implemented as needed...|$|R

We know that concrete is as a man – when concrete is made it is as a baby, then it ages and its properties change in accordance to its baby life.

Article describes monitoring concrete structure during the first 24 hours from their making. Acoustic Emission Method and the measurement temperature were used for monitoring both samples. Theory One of the important quantities providing insight into the processes taking place in the specimen structure, particularly during the early phase, is the specimen internal temperature. In consequence of chemical reactions, the highest temperature changes are expected to take place during the setting phase, i. e., the first hours of the measurement. As it is not intended to study processes taking place in purely laboratory (theoretically ideal) conditions the specimen is stored and measured in a room where the temperature fluctuates (i. e. the ambient temperature in the neighborhood of 20 °C) [1, 2].

In 1810 he built a beautiful temple within the school grounds and showed his sympathies for reforming ritual by adding Hymns in German that were sung by a choir of boys, and prayers in German were added to those in Hebrew and Aramaic. He also had a pipe organ installed. Though not unheard of in synagogues before, its subsequent association with the new movement would later anathemize the organ {{in the eyes of}} the Orthodox in Central Europe (albeit it was introduced, without controversy, in France and Italy). The progressive nature of his views was further shown by his strong advocacy of the introduction of confirmation. In the Seesen temple it was Jacobson himself who confirmed the first five Jewish boys. When, under Napoleon's rule, the Kingdom of Westphalia was created, and the emperor's brother Jérôme Bonaparte was placed at its head, Jacobson, who had removed to the residence of the king at Cassel, was appointed president of the Jewish consistory (...) , established on 3 March 1808. In his capacity as consistorial president, assisted by a board of officers, he did his best to exercise a reforming influence upon the various congregations of the country. He also advocated a seminary for the training of Jewish teachers. A double portrait of him and his first wife Mink Samson, painted by the Jewish court-painter Salomon Pinhas (ca. 1808) is at the European Art collection of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The paper {{seeks to}} draw on Sice's systems model, itself based on Senge's “fixes that fail” archetype, and on data from two {{previous}} research projects conducted {{by one of the}} authors. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to synthesise a new model that portrays the information-seeking behaviour of children and young people. Design/methodology/approach – The systems model provides the backbone of the new framework but additions, accommodations and revisions were made to ensure that the version featured here represents the phenomenon of information seeking by the <b>young</b> <b>as</b> appropriately <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> in terms of the data that were gathered. Findings – One of the new model's most significant characteristics is its emphasis on problems and issues that prevent information seeking from proceeding smoothly. Information seeking is also shown to be an iterative process, with the individual often revisiting previous stages, frequently in response to difficulties. Research limitations/implications – Data were collected from pupils in just seven schools. The undertaking of research further a-field would be invaluable, if the extent to which the model is applicable to other information-seekers in different environments is to be ascertained. Practical implications – The model demonstrates the importance of the information professional's educative role, in terms of both delivering formal information literacy instruction and providing assistance at the point of need. Originality/value – Although the use of ideas and frameworks from other disciplines, with the aim of increasing understanding of phenomena within LIS, is a growing trend, this paper represents one of the first attempts to apply an existing model associated with systems thinking to information behaviour...|$|R
