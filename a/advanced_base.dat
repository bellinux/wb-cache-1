5|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} involving Wooten, Barbey, Edmund Herring (Wooten's superior as commander of I Corps), Colonel Merian C. Cooper from the Fifth Air Force, and Air Commodore Joe Hewitt from the RAAF, reached agreement, or at least compromise, on many points. Wooten wanted at least 10 days' reserve rations. This meant that some stores {{would have to be}} transported in bulk, and not pre-loaded on trucks as Barbey initially wanted. Loading the stores onto trucks was an inefficient use of shipping space, but permitted quick unloading of the LSTs, as the trucks could simply be driven off. The 9th Division did not have sufficient trucks for this, but 200 trucks earmarked for the US <b>Advanced</b> <b>Base</b> at Lae were borrowed from USASOS. Barbey would not allow loaded vehicles on the tank decks of the LSTs, as this was a fire hazard, so bulk stores were carried there instead.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the efforts}} in the {{creation}} of the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Base</b> School, too much energy had been spent on academic arguments over the <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> concept; it was time to fully test the concept in fleet maneuvers. By December 1913, the Marine Corps had done more to make the <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> force a reality in one year than it had in the last twelve years.|$|E
25|$|Between 2–3 January 1914, the Mobile Defense Regiment sailed aboard USS Prairie and rendezvoused {{with the}} Fixed Base Regiment at Culebra Island, Puerto Rico, forming the first {{operational}} <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> force brigade, the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Base</b> Force Brigade.|$|E
25|$|On 3 January 1914, the Fixed Defense Regiment at Culebra Island, Puerto Rico, {{along with}} the Mobile Defense Force, formed the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Base</b> Force Brigade, {{under the command of}} Colonel George Barnett, who had {{commanded}} the Marine Barracks at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Base</b> School.

The aviation company with the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Base</b> Force, however, missed its first chance at expeditionary duty during this operation because it had not yet discovered a way to get its two aircraft, both seaplanes, to the objective area in flying condition.|$|E
25|$|Next {{to serve}} as the {{assistant}} to Commandant George Barnett was Colonel John A. Lejeune. During his tenure of 1915—1917, he spoke for the Commandant, stressing the missions of the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Base</b> Force. He argued that the Marine Corps' organization needed reconstructing, urging that the Marine Corps as a whole, not just particular regiments, be assigned to <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> duty; this reorganization should be the Marine Corps' primary function in the United States' naval services. Col. Lejeune also supported the article printed in the Marine Corps Gazette by John H. Russell, who drafted one of the earliest <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> force studies.|$|E
25|$|A {{brilliant}} and well-decorated Marine intelligence officer, Lieutenant Colonel Earl H. Ellis, a fellow {{patron of the}} Navy War College in 1912–1913, {{was influenced by the}} <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> operations concept. In his tenure as a student, and later as an instructor, he created a curriculum for and instrumented war plans and procedures that became vital {{to the success of the}} United States' Pacific island-hopping campaign that would occur 25 years later in World War II. He also plotted accurate charts, based on his ability in hydrographic surveying and topography; pointing out that seizing a well-defended island rested upon the integral <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> force, and that the Marine Corps' future fully relied on the <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> force, for both defense and assault. Ellis' brilliance even impressed John A. Lejeune, who soon became Ellis' patron as well as a coadvocate of the <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> force concept.|$|E
50|$|The United States Marine Corps has a {{long history}} of seizing and {{defending}} <b>advance</b> <b>bases.</b> Prior to World War I, base defense was the Marine Corps’ primary mission. During World War I, the <b>Advance</b> <b>Base</b> Force was created to seize and defend enemy territory consisting primarily of bases. In 1933, the <b>Advance</b> <b>Base</b> Force transformed into the Fleet Marine Force (FMF) under Commandant Major General Ben Fuller. By 1939, the looming threat of Japanese aggression in the Pacific solidified the need for <b>advance</b> <b>base</b> defense in the region. Commandant Major General Thomas Holcomb formed four Defense Battalions to defend <b>advance</b> naval <b>bases</b> from ground and air attack. The core of the original battalions was formed from two infantry battalions, 1st and 2nd Battalion, 15th Marine Regiment. Subsequent Defense Battalions were formed with air defense personnel and artillerymen; infantrymen were attached as required. The first Defense Battalions included nearly 900 Marines divided into three anti-aircraft batteries, three seacoast batteries, and ground and anti-aircraft machine gun batteries. Follow-on evolutions included more sophisticated artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and search radars. These Defense Battalions provided the first combined arms teams and proved to be a very effective fighting force.|$|R

25|$|The United States Marine Corps's <b>Advanced</b> <b>Base</b> Force (Advance Base Force in some references) was {{a coastal}} and naval base defense force that was {{designed}} to set up mobile and fixed bases in the event of major landing operations within, and beyond, the territorial United States. Established {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century, the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Base</b> Force was the United States' first combined task force built on the concept of the Marine Corps' traditional role in expeditionary warfare. The slow development of the <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> force played a significant role in the controversy over the removal of the ships' guards (Marines on Navy ships) in 1908–1909.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> {{exercises}} {{had taken}} place on Culebra, Puerto Rico in 1903, proving to the General Board how well the Marines could perform the ideals and concepts that were conceived. It opened many new perspectives {{for the future of}} the Marines; and it sparked a harsh chapter of interservice rivalry. The captain of USS Panther demanded that the Marines perform their duties as a ship's guard, including ship security and acting as a provost marshal to provide deterrence against mutiny. This act forcibly neglected the <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> force battalion's training schedule and defense planning. Even ashore the naval officers had little understanding of the problems of moving heavy weaponry and equipment across broken terrain, and the <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> force languished by 1903 due to the large number of east coast Marines deployed to Panama and Cuba. Only then were the Marines in the Philippines included in the General Board's <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> force concept.|$|E
25|$|Two new {{revolutions}} in the Marine Corps {{also helped}} established {{the legitimacy of}} the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Base</b> Force; the first was the formation of the Marine Corps Association (MCA) and the Marine Corps Gazette, founded by John A. Lejeune in 1911, and second, the new avenues for innovation of Marine and Naval Aviation. The Marine Corps' first aviator, 1st Lieutenant Alfred A. Cunningham, saw a role for aircraft in the <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> force. Joined at Annapolis by Lieutenant Bernard L. Smith, the Marine Corps' second aviator, both learned to fly planes from civilian instructors, and both later reported to the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Base</b> Force in 1913, to create an aviation section within the force.|$|E

In this key position, Eccles coordinated the planning, construction, and support of <b>advance</b> <b>bases</b> in the Central Pacific, a critical aspect of the American island-hopping strategy in the war against Japan. For his service in this capacity, he received the Legion of Merit.|$|R

25|$|Relying on {{the full}} {{projection}} capabilities of their naval counterparts, the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Base</b> Force enabled the United States Navy to meet all the demands for its use of naval services within its own sphere of maritime operations. It also allowed operational independence, without {{the cooperation of the}} United States Army for troops and military supplies, as such a force might not be available. The General Board had concluded that one or two regiments of the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Base</b> Force were more than adequate to defend naval bases against cruiser raids, and were also able to land with thirty emplaced naval guns, high-angle field artillery, machine guns, infantry, and water and land minefields. The <b>Advanced</b> <b>Base</b> Force is the ancestor of today's Fleet Marine Force.|$|E
25|$|By March 1910, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Beekman Winthrop, acting for the Secretary, {{sent the}} order to the Commandant.

Admiral George Dewey expressed disappointment and Navy Commander William F. Fullam even denounced Elliott for failure to use additional Marines for expeditionary duty, which was the only hope for naval reformers in creating the <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> force.|$|E

This exercise proved to the Marine Corps the necessity of naval gun emplacement and setting up base defenses. Also, the expeditionary battalion that was stationed in Cavite, Philippines had already been exercising in Subic Bay and had employed eight heavy guns at the bay's entrance. Even though the battalion in the Philippines was not formally part of the <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> force concept, it was marking a new ideal for the Marine Corps.|$|E
25|$|In June 1913 the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Base</b> Force brigade was formed, {{composed}} of two permanently organized regiments, the Fixed Defense Regiment and the Mobile Defense Regiment. Each regiment was tailored to its specific part in the <b>advanced</b> <b>base</b> force concept. At the same time, numerical designations for companies were adopted to alleviate the problem of having more than one company A, for example, in any units of an expeditionary force. On 23 December 1913, the brigade was redesignated as the 1st Advance Force Brigade, and again on 1 April 1914, as the 1st Brigade. The 1st Brigade was deactivated on 15 August 1934, after participating in the Occupation of Haiti from August 1915 until August 1934.|$|E
