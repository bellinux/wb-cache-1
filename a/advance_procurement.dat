40|$|Purpose: To {{explore the}} role played by {{manufacturers}} of patented products on construction projects. [...] Methodology: Four projects are reviewed to investigate the research question “How can manufacturers ensure the successful implementation of their product innovations on construction projects?” [...] Findings: Using a framework comprising six key innovation determinants, case-study analysis demonstrates the critical role played by relationships and knowledge-flows in creating conditions that support project-based innovation by manufacturers. Such conditions comprise: [...] 1. 	<b>advanced</b> <b>procurement</b> systems, [...] 2. 	robust internal firm competencies, [...] 3. 	performance-based regulations, [...] 4. 	effective technical support providers, and [...] 5. 	project-imbedded manufacturers. [...] Research Limitations: The study was designed to meet industry needs and hence does not emphasise theoretical aspects. [...] Practical Implications: Manufacturers can improve the diffusion of their product innovations on construction projects by using relationship networks to promote the above conditions, or to locate contexts where such conditions prevail, or to leverage those conditions that are most favourable. [...] Originality: The paper addresses four gaps in the construction management literature (1) there is very little literature on the role of manufacturers in innovation on construction projects (2) the literature on subcontractors tends to assume easily substitutable supplies (3) there is a focus in the literature on large projects, and (4) the literature is dominated by quantitative studies. By undertaking a qualitative analysis of manufacturers of patented products subcontracting to small projects, this paper addresses the above shortcomings. -...|$|R

40|$|Residential {{construction}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important subdivision of construction industry, necessitating <b>advanced</b> <b>procurement</b> methods {{in order to accommodate}} changing requirements. Commonly, residential construction demand is met by the informal sector of construction industry. With the changing environments, a novel trend of package deal contracts is spreading in the context bringing in formalities to the residential construction projects. Package deal is a developed procurement method with unique characteristics. However, in selecting an appropriate procurement method for a specific housing construction project, proper understanding of characteristics of available procurement options are utmost of importance. Therefore, this research aimed to elucidate the suitability of package deal contracts for residential building construction, against time, cost and quality benefits. Study identified 43 time, cost, and quality related expectations through a comprehensive literature survey, which residential construction clients would expect to be born of package deal contracts. The factors were ranked against industry experts' view and further, tested via a survey with a sample of clients with package deal and informal construction experience. Data were analysed for medians and standard deviations in to rank the factors considering the reliability. Consequently, experts appreciated time and cost benefits of package deal contracts over informal construction. Importantly, projects start quickly with known early commitments under package deal contracts. However, informal construction offers better quality with attractive finished products. Therefore, the package deal is suitable for the clients, who are concerned of time and cost benefits, while informal {{construction is}} suitable for the client’s with prime concern of quality benefits...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{discusses the}} construction of the Central Mercury Treatment System (CMTS) in Building 9623 at the Y- 12 Plant, the remediation activities involved, waste generated from the project, and the monitoring schedule of the CMTS. As part of the Reduction of Mercury in Plant Effluent Program, the project treats groundwater contaminated with mercury from Buildings 9201 - 4, 9201 - 5, and 9204 - 4 at the Y- 12 Plant to meet National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit limits for discharge to East Fork Poplar Creek. The CMTS, located in Building 9623, will treat water from the sumps of buildings in which mercury was used in operations and which {{have been shown to be}} significant contributors to the overall levels of mercury in plant effluents. This project was anticipated when the NPDES Permit was issued, and the contamination limits and frequency of monitoring for the system discharge are detailed in the permit as Outfall 551. This project was performed as an Incentive Task Order and included the <b>advance</b> <b>procurement</b> of the carbon columns, removal of existing equipment in Building 9623, and system installation and checkout. Construction activities for installing the system started in January 1996 after the area in Building 9623 had been cleared of existing, obsolete equipment. The CMTS became operational on November 26, 1996, well ahead of the permit start date of January 1, 1998.

Subjects covered include: Linking financial strategy and sustainability Reporting sustainability Managing and financing a sustainable workforce Sustainable procurement and value for money Sustainable funding for universities. The procurement function within universities has an important role to play in supporting sustainability initiatives. An <b>advanced</b> <b>procurement</b> solution can be a key platform for supporting sustainability within universities. For example, Science Warehouse's unique Active Spend Management tools: Can direct users to the most environmentally-friendly product purchases Aggregate user demand and support just-in-time ordering to reduce deliveries on campus Deliver process efficiencies in ordering and accounts payable Provide in depth reporting and analytics. The conference this year also {{comes at a time when}} university finance directors are under increasing budgetary pressure as the government implements cuts in the sector, the financial crisis has impacted investment returns and the economic recession threatens to knock back charitable giving. Against this backdrop, and perhaps ironically for this sector, implementing e-procurement to drive savings might be seen as a bit of a 'no brainer'. Institutions such as the University of Leeds and King's College London first implemented e-procurement solutions as far back as 2001 and have been generating significant efficiencies and savings ever since so it is something of a national scandal that the majority of the sector has failed to follow suit. Indeed, it can be argued that they are unnecessarily wasting £ 100, 000 in cash savings and over £ 100, 000 in efficiencies for every £ 1 million in indirect expenditure.
