50|$|In 1431, {{a lawyer}} {{representing}} the guild of bitmakers of Barcelona arrived in Bagà {{to obtain a}} copy of a document authenticating a miracle supposedly performed by Saint Stephen on Galceran de Pinós. Finding the rector of the city away on business, the lawyer obtained the testimony of the oldest and most trustworthy men of Bagà in a public information-gathering session held in front of a notary public. The first sworn testimony recorded was that of Pere Tomich. His recollection is detailed and he adds the story of one hundred young ladies who were rescued through the saint's intervention. All subsequent witnesses simply <b>affirmed</b> Pere's <b>testimony,</b> adding that so had they heard from their fathers and grandfathers.|$|R
6000|$|As the Saxon laws did {{not suffer}} any transaction, whether of the sale of land or goods, to pass but in the shire and before witnesses, so all controversies of them were {{concluded}} by {{what they called the}} scyre witness.[68] This was tried by the oaths of the parties, by vivâ voce testimony, and the producing of charters and records. Then the people, laity and clergy, whether by plurality of votes or by what other means is not very certain, <b>affirmed</b> the <b>testimony</b> in favor of one of the claimants. Then the proceeding was signed, first by those who held the court, and then by the persons who affirmed the judgment, who also swore to it in the same manner.[69] ...|$|R

A number of attendants <b>affirmed,</b> in <b>testimony</b> to the Select Committee on Sites for Churches, illnesses contracted by worshippers attending services held outdoors in inclement weather. A letter by Riddell to Graham Speirs, Esq., notes [...] "I find it impossible, conscientiously, to grant sites for churches, manses, and schools, which would imply a sanction on my part, and give a perpetuity on my estates, to a system which I believe to be anti-social and anti-Christian." ...|$|R

50|$|In 1971, Feldman gave {{evidence}} {{in favour of}} the defendants in the Oz trial. He would not swear on the Bible, choosing instead to <b>affirm.</b> Throughout his <b>testimony,</b> he mocked the judge after it was implied {{that he had no}} religion because he was not Christian. By this time, The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine (1971-72) was in preparation, a TV series co-produced by Associated Television (ATV) and the American Broadcasting Company which was produced at ATV's Elstree Studios, near London.

40|$|Depending on one’s perspective, Socrates’ brief words {{concerning}} the Good in Republic 6 have either cast a guiding light, or an ambiguous shadow over so much subsequent philosophy. For some, they offer <b>testimony</b> <b>affirming</b> {{the existence of}} objective, even eternal values: despite suffering, imperfections and much evil, ultimately being is good. But for others, such as Nietzsche, Socrates’ words are a lie and represent the deception that has most crippled the Western mind. From this perspective, there are no objective values, and existence is not good except insofar as we make it so...|$|R
50|$|The long-defunct La Opinión {{became one}} of {{numerous}} points of contention during a series of political controversies between Clarín and Kirchnerism from 2008 onward. David Graiver's widow, Lidia Papaleo, testified in 2010 to having been intimidated by Clarín Group executive Héctor Magnetto, and subsequently tortured by the police, to forfeit further payment in 1977 for her inherited shares in La Opinión and the nation's leading newsprint maker, Papel Prensa.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} current {{research}} at the University of Sussex, located within the sociology of education, and funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). It examines the experiences of lone parents studying toward Higher education (HE) qualifications at UK Higher education institutions (HEIs). The paper begins with explanation of the research, including timescale, methodology, limitations, progress and preliminary findings. The longitudinal nature of the research yielded a large volume of rich data, providing insight across diverse themes. The paper utilises segments of participant responses to demonstrate central conference themes. In addressing the HE access routes, processes and experiences of this group of adult learners, data presented focuses on how these testimonies illuminate the uncertainties and complexities of modern life, including the often non-linear nature of learning careers and impact of adult learning upon self-identity. As with existing research (Edwards 1993 : 33, Wisker 1996 : 4, Arksey 1994), ‘balancing’ and ‘juggling’ of multiple identities and fragmented lives in modern life emerge as central themes. <b>Testimonies</b> <b>affirm</b> uncertainty, risk and individualisation of life in late modernity. Biographic data demonstrates the impact of factors including institutional cultures, class, gender, ethnicity, age and disability in determining learning careers, identities, individualisation and risk...|$|R
