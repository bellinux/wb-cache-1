Analyses {{in this paper}} are restricted to males who are aged 25 to 64 and have a partner. Of particular interest is whether a non-intact family background has {{a negative impact on}} an individual’s paid employment participation later in life, when the effects of other covariates are <b>adjusted</b> for <b>in</b> our <b>statistical</b> <b>models.</b> <b>In</b> order to answer these questions, two different parametric <b>statistical</b> <b>models</b> are applied to the first wave data from the survey of Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA). 1...|$|R

Acesso restrito. p. 1281 - 1287 This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} visual precocity, muscling, conformation, skeletal, and breed scores; live weights at birth, at 205, and at 550 days of age; and, besides, rib eye area and fat thickness between the 12 th and 13 th ribs obtained by ultrasound. Those traits were evaluated in 1, 645 Angus cattle kept in five feeding conditions as follows: supplemented or non-supplemented, grazing native pasture or grazing cultivated pasture, and feedlot. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlations, and {{principal component analysis}} were carried out. Gender and feeding conditions were fixed effects, while animal's age and mother's weight at weaning were the covariates analyzed. Gender and feeding conditions were very significant for the studied traits, but visual scores were not influenced by gender. Animal's age and mother's weight at weaning influenced many traits and must be appropriately <b>adjusted</b> <b>in</b> the <b>statistical</b> <b>models.</b> An important correlation between visual scores, live weights, and carcass traits obtained by ultrasound was found, which can be analyzed by univariate procedure.

40|$|Several recent {{epidemiology}} {{studies suggest}} that exposure to magnetic fields {{may be one of}} the etiologic factors involved in adverse reproductive health outcomes, but these studies potentially had several important design limitations that undermine the validity of their findings and subsequent conclusions. This research examined these limitations in detail using hypothesis-driven data collection and statistical analyses with the underlying goal of informing the design of future epidemiology studies concerning exposure to magnetic fields and adverse reproductive health. The study design and other related exposure science issues examined by this research included: 1) the adequacy of using a single day’s worth of personal magnetic field exposure data to characterize longer periods of exposure; 2) the potential influence of physical activity on personal magnetic field exposure; and 3) the comparison of personal magnetic field exposures between women and men and within female-male couples. These issues were assessed with data from two longitudinal cohorts of men and/or women recruited from prenatal care clinics in North Carolina and an infertility center in Massachusetts. We observed that measures of central tendency associated with daily personal magnetic field exposures were more stable over time compared with measures of peak, and the stability of these metrics was greater over short- relative to long-term durations. The findings suggest that if there is interest in peak exposure metrics, more than one day of measurement is needed over the window of disease susceptibility to reduce measurement error. We also observed a positive relationship between physical activity and peak magnetic field exposure metrics, suggesting physical activity could be an important confounder in the relationship with any outcome independently associated with activity, such as miscarriage, and, as a result, should be <b>adjusted</b> for <b>in</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>models</b> to reduce bias. In addition, we demonstrated that distributions of personal exposures among women and men are similar, and that there is promise that one partner’s exposure data could be used as a surrogate for the other’s in the absence of such data. Future reproductive health epidemiology studies that concern exposure to magnetic fields should consider this research in the design and interpretation of their findings...|$|R

This paper summarizes the various techniques that are used <b>in</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>modeling</b> of images. <b>Statistical</b> analysis of images reveals two interesting properties: (i) invariance of image statistics to scaling of images, and (ii) non-Gaussian behavior of image statistics, i. e. high kurtosis, heavy tails, and sharp central cusps. In this paper we review some recent results <b>in</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>modeling</b> of natural images that attempt to explain these patterns. Two categories of results are considered: (i) studies of probability models of images or image decompositions, and (ii) discoveries of underlying image manifolds while restricting to natural images...|$|R
