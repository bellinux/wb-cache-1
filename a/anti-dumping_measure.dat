Its UK steel operations had lost £68 million {{in the three months}} to February 2016, from a profit the previous year despite rising demand - a primary factor in the loss was lowered steel prices due to global imports, with Russia, South Korea and particularly China cited as dumping steel.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} WTO Appellate Body Report on United States-Anti-Dumping Measures on Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG) from Mexico (WT/DS 282 /AB/R 2 November 2005). This dispute {{concerns}} the disciplines {{imposed by the}} Anti-Dumping Agreement on WTO Members seeking to extend their anti-dumping measures beyond the original five-year period through a so-called sunset review. Our analysis focuses on the Appellate Body's finding {{in this case that}} no causation analysis is required in sunset reviews, and addresses the AB's approach towards the legal instrument that provides for the US policy in terms of sunset reviews, the Sunset Policy Bulletin. We conclude that the Anti-Dumping Agreement, as interpreted by the Appellate Body in this and other similar cases, imposes only minimal disciplines of a general nature on Members wishing to extend the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measure</b> beyond its original five-year period. We argue that the ‘textual' argument relied on to support this deferential approach is weak and has resulted in undermining the practical effect of, what was considered to be, one of the major achievements of the Uruguay Round Anti-Dumping Agreement: limiting the life span of an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measure</b> to five years. From an economic perspective, Panels and the Appellate Body are simply debating the wrong type of questions. The prospective nature required by a sunset review analysis raises questions such as why exporters engaged in dumping in the first place, and what the conditions of the industry were so that the dumped imports caused injury. At the moment, sunset reviews seem adrift as panels and the Appellate Body fail to give guidance to Members on how to do a more economically sound and informed revie...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studied the}} effects of {{anti-dumping}} measures on the imports to investigate whether the trade restriction effect of an anti-dumping duty is dominant. Our results indicate that a 1 % increase in the anti-dumping duties decreases the import of the targeted product by about 0. 43 ~ 0. 51 %. The actual statistics, however, show that the total import of the targeted products increased by about 30 percent while an anti-dumping duty was in force. That indicates that an anti-dumping duty is just a temporary import relief. This paper also investigated whether an anti-dumping duty is terminated in {{the case that the}} injury would not be likely to continue or recur if the duty were removed. The hazards model estimates show that increase in market share, MFN tariff rate, and dumping margin decrease the hazard of termination of an anti-dumping duty, but the increase in value added increases the hazard of termination. Generally speaking, this result indicates that the WTO member countries have regulated the overuse of an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measure.</b> The findings of this paper show that there is a country- and industry-wise heterogeneous characteristic in the effect as well as termination of an anti-dumping duty...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the GATT/WTO rules for <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> in a duopoly model with both {{horizontal and vertical}} product differentiation. The GATT/WTO rules allow for <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> if the domestic producers are injured associated with price discrimination. However, it is argued in this paper that the calculations of injury margins are flawed because of negligence of quality differences. This gives countries with high quality producers an option to practice protectionism. This bias in the possibility to implement <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> predominantly favours the developed countries which are specialized in producing high quality products. The paper also shows that qualities and prices converge when trade costs decrease. Moreover, it is shown that a decrease of trade costs harms the profit of the high quality producer and this might increase the high quality producer’s pressure for <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures.</b> The paper suggests that prices should be corrected for quality differences {{in the assessment of}} injury. Such change will limit the number of anti-dumping cases, but also eliminate the advantage of the developed countries in the ability to introduce <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R

Even though free trade is expected from {{the members of the}} World Trade Organization (WTO) there are certain exceptions. One is when there is a suspicion that goods are being dumped in a foreign market, i. e. the exporter sells the product at a lower price in the foreign market than in its home market. Article VI in GATT regulates this together with the Anti-dumping Agreement. In 1997 EU imposed an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measure</b> on certain footwear imported from the People’s Republic of China. This measure was in effect until 2002 (the maximum time for an anti-dumping tariff is five years). We expect to see a decrease of footwear exports from the People’s Republic of China to the European Union during this period. By using a log-linear regression analysis we can see that the EU imports of Chinese footwear did indeed decrease from its trend otherwise during 1997 to 2002. Since the industry overall increased its sales during the same period, we draw the conclusion that the tariff was the reason for the decreased imports...|$|E

The strengthening of the multilateral disciplines on afeguards — including the prohibition and elimination of voluntary export restraints and he commitments to phase out the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) quotas under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) — appears to have provoked an increasing resort to <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures.</b> C rtain countries and product sectors, such as teel and textiles, have been targeted more than others.

40|$|The {{usage of}} {{unconventional}} trade protections have been thriving worldwide and anti-dumping initiation {{is one of}} them. India has appeared the highest initiator of anti-dumping in the world during 1995 - 2010. The paper tries to investigate the impact of such initiatives on trade flows and resultant welfare with a particular reference to Indian economy. Anti-dumping initiative defends competition, protects domestic producers and goes against consumer welfare in general, but the strategic initiative may lead to rise in AD-jumping FDI flows, resulting to an improvement in domestic welfare. Theoretically, {{we find that the}} possibility of AD-jumping FDI depends on the foreign price and labour market conditions in the domestic economy. Closer to the oligopoly price in the domestic economy lower would be the possibility and greater would be a loss of domestic welfare. Moreover, in the presence of unions, such possibility goes down. The study uses industry and firm level information empirically to see the impact. It is observed that the AD initiation does not affect the imports significantly. FDI has grown but still very small. The mark-up of AD intensive industries seems to be on the higher side and does not support the AD-jumping FDI proposition effectively. A large share of Indian initiatives, similar to other countries, has been against China and other neighboring countries, leading to rise an issue of predatory pricing including the rules of origin applicable largely with them. We suggest that AD investigation process should look at (i) the price formation and rules of origin in the foreign markets, (ii) the extent of extra-legal employment and environmental damage due to the increased import competition. Although Indian government has been quite active in taking decision on any petition against dumping, the existing laws favour only a small section of producers, do not apply uniform methods of injury calculation and do not show any concern about labour and environment. We suggest that the safeguard measure should be taken up first before using <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measure</b> in cased of dumping...|$|E

With the expiration of quotas in 2005, many developing countries/LDCs have experienced considerable adjustment challenges. With the end of quotas {{and the increase in}} competitive pressures on countries, use of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures,</b> has become increasingly attractive as a market protection mechanism. This presentation assesses the use of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> in T 2 ̆ 6 C sector through two possible application scenarios i. e. developing-to-developing countries and developed-to-developing countries. The presentation refers to earlier work done by Chad Bown on the Endogenous Trade Policy theory and would extend Bown’s analysis to the T 2 ̆ 6 C sector.

40|$|Abstract: While many trade {{barriers}} {{have been reduced}} in recent years, contingency trade policy barriers have tended {{to take their place}} in many countries. <b>Anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> can be legitimate protection against predatory pricing but often constitute important {{trade barriers}}. Consequently, some industries lobby for such measures when facing particularly competitive foreign firms. However, it is obvious that not all lobbying is successful. Previous literature has followed Olson‟s (1965) argument that small industries are likely to succeed in lobbying as they can overcome free-rider problems and coordination costs, and that particularly vocal actors may exert more influence. However, the characteristics of the politicians being lobbied are often ignored. In this paper, we focus on the use of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> in the European Union. Our main question is to which extent geographical or political proximity to Brussels, the political centre of the EU, makes anti-dumping petitions more or less likely to succeed? We provide a tentative answer to the question by estimating a set of determinants of the probability of success in anti-dumping petitions, and the subsequent value of the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> implemented. Our results suggest that being geographical distant to Brussels does make the success of anti-dumping petitions more probable, but does not influence the level of implemented duties. On the other hand, the results suggest that being ideologically distant to the country chairing the EU Council of Ministers at the time of decision reduces the chances of approval an anti-dumping petition, but given approval rightwing governments chairing the Council increase the chance for a higher level of protection...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> as a trade {{protection}} tool, {{has increased}} phenomenally {{during the last}} decade. One significant aspect of this new trend is the increasing involvement of developing countries. India is one such country which {{has emerged as a}} very frequent user of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures,</b> surpassing even the traditional users. It had initiated more than 300 anti-dumping cases by the end of 2002 - 03. Many of these cases are against developing countries. Most of the cases are concentrated in narrow range product groups, like chemicals and petrochemicals, iron and steel, pharmaceuticals and textiles. This study examines India's experience with <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures.</b> The main objective of the study is to identify the factors which might have influenced the anti-dumping behaviour in India. Discussion of these factors shows that imports have increased considerably. This is particularly true for a number of developing countries facing dumping charges in India. At the same time, many of the domestic producers of the like products have performed poorly during the last decade. Such trends may instigate the import-competing industries to seek anti-dumping protection and may also influence the authority to provide that. However, the results of our statistical exercise show that, although imports and performance of the domestic industry might have influenced the initiation of anti-dumping cases, these factors did not seem to significantly influence the final decision of the authority. The results rather indicated a tendency {{on the part of the}} authority to provide anti-dumping protection to industries, which are characterised by a large number of firms.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the use of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> {{in order to make}} economic sense of what seems to amount to cheating on an international agreement. There are numerous loopholes in the Anti-dumping Agreement which allow <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> {{to be used as a}} form of protection by import-competing industries against fair trade. Some of these loopholes are of a purely legal nature, while others are more practical. During an anti-dumping investigation, a dumping margin is calculated in order to establish whether or not an accused exporter is dumping. This calculation is known as the determination of dumping. In this thesis, the various ways in which the dumping margin can be manipulated or ”captured” are investigated. It is shown that there are numerous ways in which the determination of dumping result can be manipulated in order to ensure a positive dumping result. And economists are concerned about this abuse of anti-dumping as it could have a chilling effect on international trade. However, it is shown in this thesis that anti-dumping investigations are concentrated in certain sectors. In other words, <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> (and other non-tariff remedies) are being used as a strategy to protect certain industries. Adam Smith, the ”father” of economics, pointed out that certain sensitive or strategic industries may need to be protected, even if such protection is at the cost of economic welfare. So, it seems that the economic issue is not really about dumping, but about whether or not certain strategic industries should be protected. And it is the protection of these strategic industries, for example the iron and steel industry, that needs further research. EconomicsD. Comm. (Economics...|$|R

In this context, this paper shall serve, first, as a reminder that the European Union will violate its WTO obligations under the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement (ADA) if the Union’s institutions continue - after December 11, 2016 - to adopt <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> against China that are based on ‘non-market economy’ (NME) treatment of Chinese exports in anti-dumping investigations. Moreover, the 2009 EU Anti-Dumping Regulation will be vulnerable to legal challenge in the WTO dispute settlement mechanism “as such” if it is not brought into compliance with the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement by that date.

40|$|China {{is a major}} {{target for}} <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> by both {{developed}} and developing countries. Its rapid industrial transition to higher value-added sectors brings it in direct conflict with the US and the EU. <b>Anti-dumping</b> <b>measures</b> have consistently been employed by the US and the EU to protect their domestic markets from encroaching Chinese exports. In the initial few years of joining the WTO, China rarely initiated any complaint in the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism (DSM), while facing several complaints itself. This approach has now evolved. China appears to have acquired the knowledge and capacity to access the WTO DSM for safeguarding its interests. As countries attempt {{to recover from the}} global financial crisis through an export-led strategy, the likelihood of developed countries using antidumping measures and countervailing duties (CVD) to protect their domestic sectors consequently increase. With this background, this paper tracks China 2 ̆ 7 s experience in the WTO with reference to antidumping disputes (both as a complainant and as a respondent). The recurrence of disputes between China and the US/EU is frequently due to alleged currency manipulation that gives China an 2 ̆ 2 unfair 2 ̆ 2 advantage in exports.

Furthermore, this paper aims to anticipate the effects of the 2016 expiry of the non-market methodology that is currently used to calculate dumping margin against Chinese exports. Once free from being subjected to a surrogate method of calculating dumping margin, China can potentially flood the world market with competitively priced exports that could have long-term consequences for industries in the US and the EU and other developed countries...|$|R
