40|$|SummaryThe {{oligosaccharide}} antibiotic <b>avilamycin</b> A {{is composed}} of a polyketide-derived dichloroisoeverninic acid moiety attached to a heptasaccharide chain consisting of six hexoses and one unusual pentose moiety. We describe the generation of mutant strains of the <b>avilamycin</b> producer defective in different sugar biosynthetic genes. Inactivation of two genes (aviD and aviE 2) resulted in {{the breakdown of the}} <b>avilamycin</b> biosynthesis. In contrast, <b>avilamycin</b> production was not influenced in an aviP mutant. Inactivation of aviGT 4 resulted in a mutant that accumulated a novel <b>avilamycin</b> derivative lacking the terminal eurekanate residue. Finally, AviE 2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and the gene product was characterized biochemically. AviE 2 was shown to convert UDP-D-glucuronic acid to UDP-D-xylose, indicating that the pentose residue of <b>avilamycin</b> A is derived from D-glucose and not from D-ribose. Here we report a UDP-D-glucuronic acid decarboxylase in actinomycetes...|$|E
40|$|Eurekanate {{belongs to}} the {{important}} class of branched-chain carbohydrates present {{in a wide variety}} of natural sources. It is a component of <b>avilamycin</b> A, a potent inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis targeting the 50 S ribosomal subunit. The present work provides experimental proof for the function of two genes of the <b>avilamycin</b> biosynthetic gene cluster, aviB 1 and aviO 2, that are both involved in <b>avilamycin</b> structure modification. The functions of both genes were identified by gene inactivation experiments and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of extracts produced by the mutants. We suggest that both AviO 2 and AviB 1 are involved in the biosynthesis of eurekanate within <b>avilamycin</b> biosynthesis. Moreover, two other genes (aviO 1 and aviO 3) have been inactivated, resulting in a breakdown of <b>avilamycin</b> production in the mutants ITO 1 and ITO 3, which clearly shows the essential role of both enzymes in <b>avilamycin</b> biosynthesis. The exact functions of both aviO 1 and aviO 3 remained unknown...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{oligosaccharide}} antibiotics <b>avilamycin</b> A and C {{are produced}} by Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü 57. Both consist of a heptasaccharide chain, which {{is attached to a}} polyketide-derived dichloroisoeverninic acid moiety. They show excellent antibiotic activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Both molecules are modified by O-methylation at different positions, which contributes to poor water solubility and difficulties in galenical drug development. In order to generate novel <b>avilamycin</b> derivatives with improved polarity and improved pharmacokinetic properties, we generated a series of mutants with one, two, or three mutated methyltransferase genes. Based on the structure of the novel <b>avilamycin</b> derivatives, the exact function of three methyltransferases, AviG 2, AviG 5, and AviG 6, involved in <b>avilamycin</b> biosynthesis could be assigned...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü 57 is the {{producer}} of <b>avilamycin</b> A. The antibiotic consists of a heptasaccharide side chain and a polyketide-derived dichloroisoeverninic acid as aglycone. Molecular cloning and characterization of the genes governing the <b>avilamycin</b> A biosynthesis is of major interest as this information might set the direction {{for the development of}} new antimicrobial agents. Results: A 60 -kb section of the S. viridochromogenes Tü 57 chromosome containing genes involved in <b>avilamycin</b> biosynthesis was sequenced. Analysis of the DNA sequence revealed 54 open reading frames. Based on the putative function of the gene products a model for <b>avilamycin</b> biosynthesis is proposed. Inactivation of aviG 4 and aviH, encoding a methyltransferase and a halogenase, respectively, prevented the mutant strains from producing the complete dichloroisoeverninic acid moiety resulting in the accumulation of new antibiotics named gavibamycins. Conclusions: The <b>avilamycin</b> A biosynthetic gene cluster represents an interesting system to study the formation and attachment of unusual deoxysugars. Several enzymes putatively responsible for specific steps of this pathway could be assigned. Two genes encoding enzymes involved in post-PKS tailoring reactions were deleted allowing the production of new analogues of <b>avilamycin</b> A...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Effects of glucose, {{ammonium}} ions and phos-phate on <b>avilamycin</b> biosynthesis in Streptomyces virido-chromogenes AS 4. 126 were investigated. Twenty {{grams per}} liter of glucose, 10 mmol/L ammonium ions, and 10 mmol/L phosphate in the basal medium stimulated <b>avilamycin</b> biosynthesis. When {{the concentrations of}} glucose, ammo-nium ions, and phosphate in the basal medium exceeded 20 g/L, 10 mmol/L, and 10 mmol/L, respectively, avila-mycin biosynthesis greatly decreased. When 20 g/L glucose was added at 32 h, <b>avilamycin</b> yield decreased by 70. 2 %. <b>Avilamycin</b> biosynthesis hardly continued when 2 -deoxy-glucose was added into the basal medium at 32 h. There was little influence on <b>avilamycin</b> biosynthesis {{with the addition of}} the 3 -methyl-glucose (20 g/L) at 32 h. In the presence of excess (NH 4) 2 SO 4 (20 mmol/L), the activities of valine dehydrogenase and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydro-genase were depressed 47. 7 and 58. 3 %, respectively, of that of the control at 48 h. The activity of succinate dehydro-genase increased 49. 5 % compared to the control at 48 h. The intracellular adenosine triphosphate level and 6 -phosphate glucose content of S. viridochromogenes were 128 and 129 %, respectively, of that of the control at 48 h, with the addition of the 40 mmol/L of KH 2 PO 4.

40|$|The {{antibiotic}} {{growth promoter}} <b>avilamycin</b> inhibits protein synthesis by binding to bacterial ribosomes. Here the binding site is further characterized on Escherichia coli ribosomes. The drug interacts with domain V of 23 S rRNA, giving a chemical footprint at nucleotides A 2482 and A 2534. Selection of avilamycin-resistant Halobac-terium halobium cells revealed mutations in helix 89 of 23 S rRNA. Furthermore, mutations in helices 89 and 91, which have previously {{been shown to}} confer resistance to evernimicin, give cross-resistance to <b>avilamycin.</b> These data place the binding site of <b>avilamycin</b> on 23 S rRNA close to the elbow of A-site tRNA.

40|$|A {{total of}} 160 growing-finishing pigs with initial body weights of 27 kg and {{originating}} from eight farms {{were used in}} a performance trial to investigate the effects of dietary fibre content (medium or high) and growth-promoting feed additives (none, <b>avilamycin,</b> formic acid or formic acid-sorbate blend) on pig growth, the feed to gain ratio and the incidence of diarrhoea. Medium-fibre grower and finisher diets (188 and 196 g neutral detergent fibre (NDF) /kg dry matter (DM)) were composed of barley and soybean meal and the respective high-fibre diets (239 and 284 g NDF/kg DM) of barley, oats, barley fibre, peas, soybean meal and vegetable oil. Both medium- and high-fibre diets were similar in net energy (8. 7 MJ/kg) and ileal digestible lysine content (8. 0 and 6. 6 g/kg for grower and finisher diets, respectively). <b>Avilamycin</b> (40 mg/kg) was added to grower diets only whereas formic acid (8 g/kg) and formic acid-sorbate blend (8 g/kg formic acid and 0. 4 g/kg potassium sorbate) were added to both grower and finisher diets. No diet × additive interactions were observed in the performance or carcass characteristics of pigs. Dietary fibre content {{did not affect the}} growth or feed to gain ratio of pigs. In the growing period, pigs fed diets with <b>avilamycin,</b> formic acid or formic acid-sorbate blend grew faster and had a lower feed to gain ratio than did those fed diets without additives. The differences between the additives were not significant. In the finishing period, pigs fed acidified diets grew faster and utilised feed more efficiently than did those in the <b>avilamycin</b> group. Furthermore, formic acid-sorbate blend enhanced pig performance more than did plain formic acid. For the total fattening period, the average growth rates were 856, 878, 896 and 930 g/d and the feed to gain ratios 2. 55, 2. 51, 2. 43 and 2. 32 kg DM/kg gain for diets without additives and with <b>avilamycin,</b> formic acid and formic acid-sorbate blend, respectively. Additives improved the growth and feed to gain ratio compared to diets without additives. Performance was better with organic acid supplementation of grower and finisher diets than with <b>avilamycin</b> supplementation of grower diet only. In addition, formic acid-sorbate blend improved the feed to gain ratio more than did plain formic acid. In the growing period, additives decreased the incidence of diarrhoea in the medium-fibre diet. In the high-fibre diet, the incidence of diarrhoea was generally low, except in the <b>avilamycin</b> treatment. We concluded that formic acid and formic acid-sorbate blend were equally effective alternatives to the antibiotic <b>avilamycin</b> in grower diets. Since organic acids can be added to finisher diets as well, their use resulted in further improvements in pig performance compared to <b>avilamycin</b> which can be used in grower diets only.

40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} effect of the growth {{promoter}} <b>avilamycin</b> on emergence and persistence of resistance in enteric bacteria in the pig. Methods and Results: Pigs (treated with <b>avilamycin</b> for 3 months and controls) were challenged with multiresistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT 104 and faecal counts were performed for enterococci, Escherichia coli, S. Typhimurium and Campylobacter (before, during and 5 weeks post-treatment). Representative isolates were tested for antibiotic resistance and for the presence of resistance genes. Avilamycin-resistant Enterococci faecalis (speciated by PCR) were isolated from the treated pigs and continued to be detected for the first week after treatment had ceased. The avilamycin- resistance gene was characterized by PCR as the emtA gene and speciation by PCR. MIC profiling confirmed that more than one strain of Ent. faecalis carried this gene. There was no evidence of increased antimicrobial resistance in the E. coli, Salmonella and Campylobacter populations, although there was a higher incidence of tetB positive E. coli in the treated pigs than the controls. Conclusion: Although <b>avilamycin</b> selects for resistance in the native enterococci population of the pig, no resistant isolates were detected beyond 1 week post-treatment. This suggests that resistant isolates were unable to persist once selective pressure was removed and were out-competed by the sensitive microflora. Significance and Impact of the Study: Our data suggest the risk of resistant isolates becoming carcass contaminants and infecting humans could be minimized by introducing a withdrawal period after using <b>avilamycin</b> and prior to slaughter...|$|E
40|$|Unravelling the {{mechanisms}} of how antibiotics influence growth performance through changes in gut microbiota {{can lead to the}} identification of highly productive microbiota in animal production. Here we investigated the effect of zinc bacitracin and <b>avilamycin</b> on growth performance and caecal microbiota in chickens and analysed associations between individual bacteria and growth performance. Two trials were undertaken; each used 96 individually caged 15 -day-old Cobb broilers. Trial 1 had a control group (n = 48) and a zinc bacitracin (50 ppm) treatment group (n = 48). Trial 2 had a control group (n = 48) and an <b>avilamycin</b> (15 ppm) treatment group (n = 48). Chicken growth performance was evaluated over a 10 -day period, and caecal microbiota was characterised by sequencing of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene amplicons. <b>Avilamycin</b> produced no effect on growth performance and exhibited little significant disturbance of the microbiota structure. However, zinc bacitracin reduced the feed conversion ratio (FCR) in treated birds, changed the composition and increased the diversity of their caecal microbiota by reducing dominant species. <b>Avilamycin</b> only produced minor reductions in the abundance of two microbial taxa, whereas zinc bacitracin produced relatively large shifts in a number of taxa, primarily Lactobacillus species. Also, a number of phylotypes closely related to lactobacilli species were positively or negatively correlated with FCR values, suggesting contrasting effects of Lactobacillus spp. on chicken growth performance.

The four antimicrobials were <b>avilamycin,</b> erythromycin, vancomycin, and virginiamycin. Major changes in the use of antimicrobial agents for growth promotion have occurred during the last 6 years in Denmark. The government banned the use of avoparcin in 1995 and of virginiamycin in 1998. Furthermore, the producers have voluntarily stopped all use beginning in 1999. The avoparcin ban in 1995 was followed by a decrease in the occurrence of glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium (GRE) in broilers, from 72. 7 % in 1995 to 5. 8 % in 2000. The occurrence of glycopeptide resistance among isolates from pigs remained constant at around 20 % from 1995 to 1997. It was shown that, in GRE from pigs, the genes encoding macrolide and glycopeptide resistance were genetically linked and that, following the decrease in the use of tylosin during 1998 and 1999, the occurrence of GRE in pigs decreased to 6. 0 % in 2000. From 1995 to 1997 the occurrence of erythromycin resistance among E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates from pigs was almost 90 %. Use of tylosin decreased considerably during 1998 and 1999, and this decrease was followed by decreases in the occurrence of resistance to 46. 7 and 28. 1 % among E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates from pigs, respectively. Erythromycin resistance among E. faecium isolates from broilers reached a maximum of 76. 3 % in 1997 but decreased to 12. 7 % in 2000 concomitantly with more limited use of virginiamycin. Use of virginiamycin increased from 1995 to 1997 and was followed by an increased occurrence of virginiamycin resistance among E. faecium isolates in broilers, from 27. 3 % in 1995 to 66. 2 % in 1997. In January 1998 the use of virginiamycin was banned in Denmark, and the occurrence of virginiamycin resistance decreased to 33. 9 % in 2000.

As a result, they also display crossresistance: bacteria resistant to <b>avilamycin</b> are resistant to evernimicin (and vice versa), but not to other classes of drugs (4).

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} tylosin, zinc-bacitracin, and <b>avilamycin</b> are {{currently}} used as prophylactics in New Zealand broiler production. Avoparcin {{was also used}} from 1977 to 2000. A total of 382 enterococci were isolated from 213 fecal samples (147 individual poultry farms) using enrichment broths plated on m-Enterococcus agar lacking antimicrobials. These isolates were then examined to determine the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. Of the 382 isolates, 5. 8 % (22 isolates) were resistant to vancomycin, and 64. 7 % were resistant to erythromycin. The bacitracin MIC was ≥ 256 μg/ml for 98. 7 % of isolates, and the <b>avilamycin</b> MIC was ≥ 8 μg/ml for 14. 9 % of isolates. No resistance to ampicillin or gentamicin was detected. Of the 22 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) isolates, 18 (81. 8 %) were Enterococcus faecalis, 3 were Enterococcus faecium, and 1 was Enterococcus durans. However, when the 213 fecal enrichment broths were plated on m-Enterococcus agar containing vancomycin, 86 VRE were recovered; 66 % of these isolates were E. faecium and the remainder were E. faecalis. Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolates {{were found to have}} heterogenous pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of SmaI-digested DNA, whereas the PFGE patterns of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis isolates were identical or closely related, suggesting that this VRE clone is widespread throughout New Zealand.

40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} in animal isolates of enterococci is {{of public health}} concern {{because of the risk}} of transfer of antibiotic resistance isolates or resistance determinants to consumers via the food chain. In this study, phenotypic and genotypic {{resistance in}} 192 pig isolates of enterococci to ampicillin, <b>avilamycin,</b> avoparcin, bacitracin, flavophospholipol, gentamicin, narasin, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin, vancomycin, virginiamycin, copper and zinc were investigated by susceptibility test and molecular methods. Resistance rates varied between the species but all isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, <b>avilamycin,</b> avoparcin, gentamicin and narasin but resistant to tetracycline and tylosin and intermediately resistant to copper. Only Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus were resistant to vancomycin and virginiamycin resistance was present in less than half the Enterococcus faecium isolates. Zinc resistance was largely confined to Enterococcus faecalis but bacitracin resistance was uncommon in E. faecalis in comparison with the other species. Tiamulin resistance was common in all species except E. casseliflavus. Resistance to flavophospholipol was detected in most E. faecium isolates and in a high proportion of E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus and E. hirae/durans but was only found in one isolate of E. faecalis. No tetO, rplC, rplD, vanA, vanB, vatA and vatD genes were found. The presence of ermB, tetL, tetM, tcrB, aac 6 -aph 2, tetK, tetS, vanC 1, vanC 2, lsaA, lsaB and vatE varied between the species and largely corresponded to the susceptibility phenotype. The findings show that resistance to antibiotics of high clinical significance for nosocomial Enterococcus infections is absent, whereas antimicrobial resistance was detected for some other antibiotics including bacitracin, flavophospholipol, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin and virginiamycin. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{comparatively}} investigate the effect of <b>Avilamycin</b> and Immunowall on the improvement of humoral immunity in boiler chickens. In this study, 360 cobb broiler chickens were divided into three similar groups of 120 chickens with four replicates of 30 chickens in each group. In the first and second experimental groups, 1 kg/ton of Immunowall and <b>Avilamycin</b> respectively were added to the basic diet while in the third control group only the basic diet was used. On days 9, 17 and 25 of the breeding period (corresponding to 1 day before and 7 and 14 days after the first Newcastle B 1 vaccination), 40 chickens were randomly chosen in each experimental group, their blood samples collected, and then serum antibody titres of these chickens against the Newcastle vaccine were measured by HI test. After stastistical analysis using ANOVA and Duncans’s multiple range test, the results of serum antibody titres by HI test on day 9 of the breeding period was not statistically significant. The results of HI test on day 17 of the breeding period (5. 01 ± 0. 32, 5. 27 ± 0. 27 and 5. 13 ± 0. 20 in the control and experimental groups 1 and 2 respectively) was also statistically not significant.

40|$|In piglets, the {{post-weaning}} {{growth check}} is {{commonly associated with}} the weaning process that occurs within the European Union at approximately 3 - 4 weeks of age. The aims of the studies reported here were to investigate the contribution and importance of nutritional influences on the complex and multi-factorial problem of the post-weaning growth check in the piglet. Multi-disciplinary investigations focussed upon the relationship between post-weaning nutrition and the gut ecosystem with specific emphasis on gut physiology, immunity and microflora. The influence of dietary acid binding-capacity (ABC) on gut morphology characteristics was investigated in 20 newly-weaned piglets up to 14 days post-weaning. Piglets offered the low ABC diet displayed more rapid recovery of villus height (after a degree of villus atrophy) than control animals (P 0. 05) effect on gut morphology; villus atrophy occurred over the initial 2 days post-weaning for animals fed ZnO, <b>avilamycin</b> or ZnO plus <b>avilamycin</b> (diets 2 - 4 respectively), compared to 4 days for control animals. No significant differences between intestinal coliform and lactobacilli load were established with respect to dietary treatment. Any differences observed in microflora load {{are most likely to}} be age-dependent. A positive relationship was established between dietary treatment (ZnO, <b>avilamycin</b> and ZnO plus <b>avilamycin)</b> on daily live weight gain post-weaning (P 0. 05), a positive influence of dietary ZnO supplementation on feed intake levels was apparent, which may account, in part, for the enhanced growth performance. This finding was not however manifested through modifications of intestinal morphology or the lactobacilli and coliform populations studied. This further suggests that dietary ZnO may exert an effect either luminally or systemically. Further research is required to determine the mechanism responsible for the enhanced feed intake and DLWG response. The effects of feeding a yeast-based nucleotide source pre- and post-weaning revealed no significant differences with respect to villus height and width. Crypt depth was significantly greater in animals fed the treatment diet post-weaning (P< 0. 001). Post-weaning nucleotide-supplemented diets were found to significantly reduce intestinal coliform load (P= 0. 033). Such an effect was not evident in animals fed the diets pre-weaning, suggesting that the gut microflora may have adapted to the dietary regimen throughout the pre-weaning period. Lymphocyte blastogenesis assays revealed that piglets fed a yeast-based nucleotide source post-weaning might be immunosuppressed at the time weaning. Conversely, when the same diets (in terms of composition) were fed from 14 days pre-weaning (study 4), no indication of immunosuppression was evident. Since no dietary effects were apparent in either study, it is postulated that this could be a general effect of the diet per se and not the actual dietary composition. It is however also possible that the animals involved in study 4 were experiencing hypersensitivity reactions to the pre-weaning dietary antigens. These animals were also combating an E. coli infection. Additional studies are however required to identify conclusively a cause and effect relationship, and elucidate the complicated interactions between nutrition or feed intake and immunobiology in the post-weaned piglet. Implementation of dietary nucleotide-supplementation from 7 days pre-weaning through to 25 days post-weaning within a commercial environment was found to enhance significantly DLWG (P< 0. 001). In summary, the current work extends current knowledge and offers a greater understanding of the factors and complex process that influence the gut ecosystem and physiology in the post-weaned piglet. This thesis confirms the crucial role feed intake or, more specifically luminal nutrition, in post-weaned piglets and has highlighted key areas for future investigation.
