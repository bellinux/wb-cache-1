5|$|A Free Ride {{was first}} shown to its target <b>audience</b> <b>in</b> 1915. At that time, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to screen stag films in public theaters due to the Victorian moral views of contemporary society. Like other pornographic films of that era, A Free Ride was released and circulated underground to avoid censorship. It was likely shown in brothels, gentlemen's clubs, illegal gatherings of men in public places, stag parties, and other all-male venues: the film was kept hidden from society at large and the government.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{was planned}} that some key {{scenes of the}} episode would be filmed without an <b>audience</b> <b>in</b> order to avoid leaks of plot spoilers, the {{producers}} decided {{not to worry about}} the issue and filmed it all in front of the live studio audience.
