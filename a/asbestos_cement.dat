40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate: (1) whether foliose lichen thalli could be transplanted from one substrate to another and (2) whether such transplants could be used to study the influence of the substrate on growth. Hence, six saxicolous lichens, with contrasting distributions on lime-rich and lime-poor substrates in South Gwynedd, Wales, were transplanted onto slate, granite, <b>asbestos</b> and <b>cement.</b> Fragments of the perimeters of thalli were glued to the different substrates using Bostic adhesive. Parmelia conspersa (Ehrh. Ex Ach.) Ach. and Parmelia saxatilis (L.) Ach., fragments increased in area over 15 months on slate and granite but decreased in area or did not survive on <b>asbestos</b> and <b>cement.</b> Fragments of Xanthoria parietina (L.) Th. Fr. and Physcia tenella (Scop.) DC. em Bitt. did not survive on slate and granite while some fragments survived but grew poorly on <b>asbestos</b> and <b>cement.</b> Parmelia glabratula ssp. fuliginosa (Fr. ex Duby) Laund. fragments decreased in area on all substrates and especially on <b>cement</b> and <b>asbestos</b> while Physcia orbicularis (Neck.) Poetsch fragments increased in area on granite and <b>cement,</b> decreased on <b>asbestos</b> and did not change significantly on slate. The results suggested that the distribution of P. conspersa and P. saxatilis was determined primarily by physico-chemical properties of the substrate. By contrast, P. glabratula ssp. fuliginosa may have responded to the transplant procedure while X. parietina, Ph. tenella and Ph. orbicularis may require nutrient enrichment to grow successfully on a substrate...|$|R

40|$|Asbestos fibres can be {{transformed}} into potentially non-hazardous silicates by high-temperature treatmentvia complete solid-state transformation.

More severe cytotoxic damage was induced by RCA than by KRY-AS after each incubation period. Exposure to KRY-AS and GC resulted in comparable cell growth rates and cytotoxic effects. Cells incubated with RCA showed greater apoptotic induction and ROS production and a lower cell proliferation index than those exposed to KRY-AS.

40|$|In Sri Lanka, {{the most}} common roofing {{materials}} use for residential housings are the clay tiles, <b>asbestos</b> sheets and <b>cement</b> tiles. In this work efforts {{have been made to}} test physical and mechanical properties of the existing calicut clay tiles, asbestos corrugated sheets and pressed cement tiles according to SLS 2 : 1975, SLS 9 : 2001 and SLS 1267 : 2005 and to find out whether they satisfy the requirements specified in the standard. Thermal conductivity has been measured by Lee's Disk method. According to the test results, the chosen calicut clay tile sample satisfied all the requirements except width and mass whereas width and pitch of corrugation were not satisfied in asbestos corrugated sheets and thickness was not satisfied in cement tiles. Thermal conductivity of clay, <b>asbestos</b> and <b>cement</b> tile was 0. 7106 W/mK, 0. 4733 W/m. K and 0. 5619 W/m. K.

25|$|Tbilisi obtains {{most of its}} {{drinking}} water from the basin of the Aragvi River north of the city. Groundwater (60% of the total) is pumped from well fields, while surface water (40%) is mostly obtained from the reservoir of the Zhinvali Dam 42km from the city. The water is treated in two plants: the Samgori plant built in the 1950s and the Grmagele plant, located at the Zhinvali Dam, built in the 1980s. The length of the water distribution network in Tbilisi is 3,600km. About 35% of the main network is made of iron pipes and 65% of steel pipes. Polyethylene pipes have been installed only recently. There are 84 reservoirs and 169 pumps. The sewer network consists of 1,600km of pipes made of ceramic, reinforced concrete, cast iron, <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> and polyethylene. The wastewater is transferred by trunk sewer with a length of 72km to the Gardabani {{waste water treatment plant}} commissioned in 1979 with a capacity of 1 million m3/day. The biological treatment at the plant is not in operation due to its high energy consumption and the associated high cost. The untreated wastewater is discharged into the Kura River.|$|E

Apart from an enclosed toilet in the north-west corner, the observation room is an open space with a central pillar that contains cavities for services that link to the roof level. Fixed angled glazing wraps around the north, east and south sides. A set of recent laminated cabinetry sits below the observation windows along the north-east. Original metal window frames on the western wall are a mixture of mid-point pivoting and fixed panes, while more recent aluminium-framed windows are found in the toilet.

40|$|Two glasses, {{belonging}} to the CaO–Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 system and corresponding to the melting of mixtures of industrial wastes (recycled glasses, mining residues, ashes, <b>asbestos</b> containing <b>cements,</b> etc.), have been successfully converted into dense glass ceramics by sintering with concurrent crystallisation. The usage of fine glass powders (< 37 micron) allowed very short sintering treatments, due to the enhanced nucleating activity of glass surfaces. In particular, dense glass ceramics could be produced by direct insertion of pressed glass powders in the furnace at the sintering temperature, followed by rapid cooling at room temperature after a 30 min holding time. The proposed approach evidences the feasibility of sintered glass ceramics by the fast and economic processes employed for traditional ceramics, with the advantage of superior mechanical properties (bending strength exceeding 100 MPa, Vickers’ microhardness exceeding 6 GPa).

40|$|Unique huts {{are being}} used as guest lodges in the South African National Kruger Game Park. These are {{inspired}} by the rondavels (indigenous round thatched adobe building), but have been westernized by adding glazed window areas, higher cement block walls and <b>asbestos</b> fiber <b>cement</b> roofs. Serious overheating and overcooling occurs if the huts are not air-conditioned. The summer design day indoor temperature then remains above 27 ?C (81 ?F), while in winter it remains below 18 ?C (64 ?F) for 20 hours per day. Tourist accommodation typically makes up 65 % of the power consumption of camps. Where camps are not grid-connected this led to high costs. Various passive design alternatives have been simulated using the Quick program, developed by the University of Pretoria. A combination of envelope optimization, earth connected ventilation pipes and ceiling fans led to thermal comfort while cost-effectively reducing peak demand by 30 % and consumption by 33 % without impairing the architecture.

However, the material is known to be carcinogenic to humans, especially affecting the serous lining of cavitary organs, producing the rare and highly malignant tumour known as mesothelioma. Yet in almost six decades (1954 - 2012) there have been only 77 known mesothelioma cases in Thailand, and none of them showed pathological evidence of asbestos etiology; only two cases among them had worked in factories using asbestos. The first Thai patient was described in a pathological book in 1954 as a case of tunica vaginalis. The first reported case was published 14 years thereafter. Studies concerning asbestos in Thailand have been few, i. e., surveys for asbestos bodies in 330 randomized autopsy lungs and in BALF; determination of airborne asbestos dust in Bangkok streets during rush hours with heavy traffic; verification of asbestos contaminant in vermiculite; and durability testing of <b>asbestos</b> and non-asbestos <b>cement</b> roof tiles.

Forty adult male albino rats were divided into four equal groups: control group, vitamin C treated group, potassium dichromate treated group and the fourth group co treated with potassium dichromate and vitamin C. Potassium dichromate was given intraperitonially for 2 weeks at a dose 2 mg/kg daily. Vitamin C was given at a dose 120 mg/kg orally daily for the same period. Specimens were processed for light and electron microscopy. Apoptosis was evaluated immunohistochemically. Specimens of potassium dichromate group showed disturbance of the normal architecture of the gland with coalescence and degeneration of thyroid follicles and desquamated cells in its lumen. Disruption of the apical and basal membranes of some thyrocytes, flattened hyperchromatic nuclei, dilated RER and swollen degenerated mitochondria were also noted. Immunohistochemically, there were changes in the immune expression of Bcl 2 in the cytoplasm of thyrocytes. Vitamin C supplemented group showed partial improvement of the previous changes.
