5|$|Adaptedness is {{the state}} of being adapted: the degree to which an {{organism}} is able to live <b>and</b> <b>reproduce</b> in a given set of habitats.|$|E
5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism. Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive <b>and</b> <b>reproduce,</b> which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness {{is not the same as}} the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if an organism could survive well <b>and</b> <b>reproduce</b> rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E

5|$|It {{spends much}} of its time {{underwater}} in order to hunt, but returns to land to digest, rest, <b>and</b> <b>reproduce.</b> It has very potent neurotoxic venom which it uses to prey on eels and small fish. Because of their affinity to land, banded sea kraits often encounter humans, but the snakes are not aggressive and only attack in self-defense.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} known monotremes was Teinolophos, which lived about 120 million years ago in Australia. Monotremes have some features which may be inherited from the original amniotes such as the same orifice to urinate, defecate <b>and</b> <b>reproduce</b> (cloaca) – as lizards and birds also do – and they lay eggs which are leathery and uncalcified.|$|E

5|$|Properties {{common to}} {{terrestrial}} organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria) {{are that they}} are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, <b>and</b> <b>reproduce.</b> An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made analogs of life may also {{be considered to be}} life.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{lifespan}} of {{the double}} drummer is {{about four or five}} weeks. During this time, they mate <b>and</b> <b>reproduce,</b> and feed exclusively on sap of living trees, sucking it out through specialised mouthparts. Female cicadas die after laying their eggs.|$|E
5|$|When hunting, banded sea kraits {{frequently}} {{head into}} deep water far from land, but return {{to land in}} order to digest, shed skin, <b>and</b> <b>reproduce.</b> Individual banded sea kraits return to their specific home islands, exhibiting philopatry. One study found that when banded sea kraits on Fijian islands were relocated to different islands 5.3km away, all recaptured individuals were found on their home islands in an average of 30.7 days.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of The Jazz Singer, all the major film {{companies}} were racing to hire audio engineers so they could record <b>and</b> <b>reproduce</b> sound for film. Through common acquaintances at Electrical Research Products, Inc. (ERPI) within Western Electric, Hilliard was contacted and hired by United Artists Studios (UA) in Hollywood, California in 1928 because of his studies in physics, engineering and acoustics. Having left his Masters studies behind in Minnesota, Hilliard, not yet 28 years old, supervised all sound recording for Coquette, UA's first talking motion picture. Western Electric provided recording equipment, but the specific techniques for achieving best sound on film had to be developed by hard work and imagination. Hilliard's ground-breaking methods later became industry standards.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria like archaea are prokaryotic – unicelluar, {{and having}} no cell nucleus or other membrane-bound organelle. Bacteria are microscopic, {{with a few}} {{extremely}} rare exceptions, such as Thiomargarita namibiensis. Bacteria function <b>and</b> <b>reproduce</b> as individual cells, but they can often aggregate in multicellular colonies. Some species such as myxobacteria can aggregate into complex swarming structures, operating as multicellular groups {{as part of their}} life cycle, or form clusters in bacterial colonies such as E.coli.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Henry W. Bates. When an edible prey animal comes to resemble, even slightly, a distasteful animal, natural selection favours those individuals that even very slightly better resemble the distasteful species. This is because {{even a small}} degree of protection reduces predation and increases the chance that an individual mimic will survive <b>and</b> <b>reproduce.</b> For example, many species of hoverfly are coloured black and yellow like bees, and are in consequence avoided by birds (and people).|$|E

5|$|Historians {{of science}} have noted that, while Darwin {{considered}} the ideas in Wallace's paper to be {{essentially the same}} as his own, there were differences. Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive <b>and</b> <b>reproduce,</b> whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge. Some historians, notably Peter J. Bowler, have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to Darwin, Wallace was not discussing selection of individual variations at all but rather group selection. However, Malcolm Kottler has shown that this notion is incorrect and Wallace was indeed discussing individual variations.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to DNA damage, a mutation {{is a change}} in the base sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive <b>and</b> <b>reproduce.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of genetic drift can be illustrated with a simplified example. Consider {{a very large}} colony of bacteria isolated in a drop of solution. The bacteria are genetically identical except for a single gene with two alleles labeled A and B. A and B are neutral alleles meaning {{that they do not}} affect the bacteria's ability to survive and reproduce; all bacteria in this colony are equally likely to survive <b>and</b> <b>reproduce.</b> Suppose that half the bacteria have allele A and the other half have allele B. Thus A and B each have allele frequency 1/2.|$|E

5|$|The open {{world was}} {{modelled}} on Southern California and Los Angeles, and its design and in-game render constituted {{much of the}} game's early work. Key members of the game world production team took field research trips throughout the region and documented their research with photo and video footage. Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos' road networks. To reflect <b>and</b> <b>reproduce</b> Los Angeles' demographic spread, the developers studied census data and watched documentaries about the city. The team considered creating the open world the most technically demanding aspect of the game's production.|$|E
5|$|Variation exists within all {{populations of}} organisms. This occurs partly because random {{mutations}} {{arise in the}} genome of an individual organism, and offspring can inherit such mutations. Throughout {{the lives of the}} individuals, their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits. The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the cell, other cells, other individuals, populations, species, as well as the abiotic environment. Individuals with certain variants of the trait may survive <b>and</b> <b>reproduce</b> more than individuals with other, less successful, variants; therefore, the population evolves. Factors that affect reproductive success are also important, including sexual selection (now often included in natural selection) and fecundity selection.|$|E
5|$|Each {{species of}} {{pathogen}} has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts. Some organisms, such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, can cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis and even overwhelming sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive vasodilation and death. Yet these organisms are {{also part of}} the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all. Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the Rickettsia, which are obligate intracellular parasites able to grow <b>and</b> <b>reproduce</b> only within the cells of other organisms. One species of Rickettsia causes typhus, while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Chlamydia, another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or urinary tract infection and may be involved in coronary heart disease. Finally, some species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Mycobacterium avium, are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis.|$|E
