5|$|Meteorologists use the {{location}} {{of some of the}} jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting. The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against, which results in significant fuel and time cost savings for airlines. Often, the airlines work to fly 'with' the jet stream for this reason. Dynamic North Atlantic Tracks are one example of how <b>airlines</b> <b>and</b> air traffic control work together to accommodate the jet stream and winds aloft that results in the maximum benefit for <b>airlines</b> <b>and</b> other users. Clear-air turbulence, a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety, is often found in a jet stream's vicinity, but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times. These are a narrow belt.|$|E
