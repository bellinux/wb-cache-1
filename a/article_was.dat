5|$|After the <b>article</b> <b>was</b> published, {{over one}} hundred {{prominent}} intellectuals, {{including some of the}} people Szabó had denounced, published a letter of support for him. Szabó’s initial response to the <b>article</b> <b>was</b> that informing had been an act of bravery intended {{to save the life of}} former classmate Pál Gábor. When this claim turned out not to be true, Szabó admitted that his true motive had been to prevent his own expulsion from the Academy.|$|E

5|$|Hogg {{published}} Shelley at Oxford, {{an account}} of his memories of Shelley in The New Monthly Magazine in 1833. The <b>article</b> <b>was</b> heavily edited after its submission, which irritated him greatly. The editing was effective however, and many reviewers were very impressed by the finished product. He also contributed articles to the Edinburgh Review. One notable <b>article</b> <b>was</b> {{a review of the}} first volume of Barthold Georg Niebuhr's Römische Geschichte.

5|$|By {{the time}} Warde's <b>article</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} some revivals {{had been released}} that were more authentic revivals of Garamond's work, based on period books and printing specimens. The German company Stempel brought out a crisp revival of the original Garamond typefaces in the 1920s, inspired by a rediscovered specimen from the Egenolff-Berner foundry in Frankfurt, as did Linotype in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Ed Roberts and Bill Yates {{finished}} the first prototype in October 1974 and shipped it to Popular Electronics in New York via the Railway Express Agency.

Roberts got to work on building a replacement. The computer on the magazine cover is an empty box with just switches and LEDs on the front panel. The finished Altair computer had a completely different circuit board layout than the prototype shown in the magazine.|$|E

5|$|On 14 April 1999, the Pakistan Post, {{as part of}} its 'Scientists of Pakistan' series, {{issued a}} {{commemorative}} stamp to honour the contributions and services of Siddiqui. In the same year, the street leading to PCSIR Laboratories Complex in Karachi was named as Shahrah-e-Dr. Salim-uz-Zaman Siddiqui. Siddiqui was also remembered by his students and colleagues, many of whom continued to dedicate their international research and publications to his memory. In 2002, a research <b>article</b> <b>was</b> published in the journal Tetrahedron in which, authors Faizi and Naz dedicated their break-through research to the memory of Siddiqui, their mentor.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 2007, Kurt Jellinek responded on the Slackers website {{by stating}} that the <b>article</b> <b>was</b> sensationalist and misleading. Jellinek said that, of the 44 units the chain had, five were sold on eBay for $399.99, {{with a couple of}} units still in stock, and 35 were held for {{specific}} customers and sold at the MSRP. The remainder were given away. Some sites believe this may violate Nintendo's enforcement of the Wii's $249 retail price, and may prevent the store from receiving future products from Nintendo. Nintendo has refused to comment on the issue.|$|E

5|$|Several {{months after}} the {{recommendation}} to have thiomersal removed from vaccines was published, a speculative <b>article</b> <b>was</b> published in Medical Hypotheses, a non-peer-reviewed journal, by parents who launched the parental advocacy group SafeMinds to promote the theory that thiomersal caused autism. The controversy began to gain legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} the public and gained widening support within certain elements in the autism advocacy community as well as in the political arena, with U.S. Representative Dan Burton openly supporting this movement and holding a number of Congressional hearings on the subject.|$|E
5|$|The <b>article</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} {{during a}} period of intense public debate. Freedom of press had been established in 1766 and encouraged people to give their suggestions on how to improve Swedish society. Economy, emigration, agriculture and education were hotly debated issues, as well as the problematic situation for unmarried middle class women. Without a spouse a woman in 18th century Sweden could have great difficulty supporting herself, especially as lower ranking servants were often promoted to maids and thereby lowering the number of employment opportunities for unmarried women.|$|E

5|$|A toyline for {{the film}} was {{confirmed}} by Hasbro in February 2012. Despite the movie's release being moved from June 2012 to March 2013, the initial assortments of figures, vehicles, and role-play items were shipped to retailers, and appeared on store shelves in May 2012. A Variety <b>article</b> <b>was</b> published stating that the already released figures had been pulled from the shelves and recalled by Hasbro, although the company's official statement indicated that existing product would be sold through. New product shipments were halted by Hasbro, but existing Retaliation figures were available in Target, Wal-Mart, and Toys R Us as late as December 2012. The toyline was re-released in the United States in February 2013. A four-part limited series comic book titled G.I. Joe: Retaliation Movie Prequel was published by IDW Publishing from February 2012 to April 2012. Written by John Barber, it acted as a prequel to the 2013 movie.|$|E
5|$|After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology {{mounted a}} public {{relations}} campaign to address issues in the piece. It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline about what he {{considered to be an}} objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the <b>article</b> <b>was</b> actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a libel suit against Time Warner and Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, an <b>article</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} {{about the}} bell's submersion and resurfacing at Geneva Lake. The article interested {{the people of}} Mount Morris, Illinois, and they sent 12 members of their Fourth of July Committee to investigate the bell in Johnsburg. The people of Mount Morris decided to purchase the bell; a committee was formed and obtained a loan from the Mount Morris VFW. The group also collected donations from local residents to purchase the bell for US$500. By July 4, 1966, the Illinois Freedom Bell hung from the gazebo in its current location, and the two writers who first suggested bell ringing as an annual Independence Day ceremony, Eric Hatch and Eric Sloane were on hand for its dedication.|$|E
