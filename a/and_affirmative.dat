5|$|While the {{selection}} process is need-blind and race-blind, most of the best high schools and preparatory schools in Brazil are private and very expensive, and represent a majority of admissions in Brazilian public universities, leading to increased inequality in the country. To remedy this, Unicamp introduced in 2004 the Social Inclusion <b>and</b> <b>Affirmative</b> Action Program (PAAIS, in Portuguese Programa de Ação Afirmativa e Inclusão Social) that allows high schoolers coming from public schools to receive a bonus score in their overall vestibular score. While not focused on racial and ethnical factors, over the years, the PAAIS initiative has {{increased the number of}} admission of minorities from public high school, especially black and native-Brazilians, historically the most economical and social fragile groups in Brazil. With this program, around 30% of admissions come from public schools, and the participation of minorities increased from 10% to around 30%.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a qualitative research study exploring lesbian <b>and</b> gay <b>affirmative</b> psychotherapy. The participants comprised two sets of people. The first are lesbian and gay male clients, the second are lesbian, gay male and heterosexual female therapists. These therapists are accredited Clinical and Counselling Psychologists, Registered Psychotherapists and Accredited Counsellors and identify as lesbian <b>and</b> gay <b>affirmative</b> -practitioners. The study explored accounts of lesbian <b>and</b> gay <b>affirmative</b> psychotherapy to see in which ways it is qualitatively different from other forms of therapy with a view to theorising the process of lesbian <b>and</b> gay <b>affirmative</b> psychotherapy. In-depth interviews were conducted and a grounded theory methodology was undertaken. This is discussed in terms of method and epistemology. The findings are represented in diagrammatic and text forms and I outline process models of lesbian <b>and</b> -gay <b>affirmative</b> therapy. While some of the findings have suggested that lesbian <b>and</b> gay <b>affirmative</b> therapeutic practice might be characterised by particular stances or practices, many of the findings can be incorporated'into a range of psychotherapeutic perspectives. Knowledge, training and contextual factors are discussed...|$|R

Clinton could also point to his centrist record as Governor of Arkansas. More liberal Democrats were impressed by Clinton's record on abortion <b>and</b> <b>affirmative</b> action. His strong connections to African Americans also played a key role. In addition, he organized significant numbers of young voters and became a symbol of the rise of the Baby Boomer generation to political power.

25|$|On the {{economic}} front, Mahathir inherited the New Economic Policy from his predecessors, {{which was designed}} to improve {{the economic}} position of the bumiputera (Malaysia's Malays and indigenous peoples) through targets <b>and</b> <b>affirmative</b> action in areas such as corporate ownership and university admission. Mahathir also actively pursued privatisation of government enterprises from the early 1980s, both for the liberal economic reasons it was being pursued by contemporaries such as Margaret Thatcher, and because he felt that combined with affirmative action for the bumiputera it could provide economic opportunities for bumiputera businesses. His government privatised airlines, utilities and telecommunication firms, accelerating to a rate of about 50 privatisations a year by the mid-1990s. While privatisation generally improved the working conditions of Malaysians in privatised industries and raised significant revenue for the government, many privatisations occurred in the absence of open tendering processes and benefited Malays who supported UMNO. One of the most notable infrastructure projects at the time was the construction of the North–South Expressway, a motorway running from the Thai border to Singapore; the contract to construct the expressway was awarded to a business venture of UMNO. Mahathir also oversaw the establishment of the car manufacturer Proton as a joint venture between the Malaysian government and Mitsubishi. By the end of the 1980s, Proton had overcome poor demand and losses to become, with the support of protective tariffs, the largest car maker in Southeast Asia and a profitable enterprise.|$|E

[...] Besides social media advances, Booker {{wants to see the}} rest of the tech sector reach its fullest potential, and to do that, he thinks the U.S. government needs to ease up on regulations. “We’re not moving at the speed of innovation due to regulations,” he said, adding that because of this, key industries are leaving the U.S. to work on projects in other countries where the rules aren’t as strict. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration has hindered drone innovation to the point where drone companies are leaving the U.S. to test and build in Europe. “We’re being left behind on everything from next-generation nuclear energy to driverless cars and biologics,” Booker said, “and we cannot get left behind.” He supports long-term deficit reduction efforts to ensure economic prosperity, Cap and Trade taxation to combat climate change, and increased funding for education. He supports ending the War on Drugs. Daniel J. Mitchell of the Cato Institute identities Booker as having libertarian views in opposition to the War on Drugs.

500|$|The National Rainbow Coalition (Rainbow Coalition for short) was a {{political}} organization {{that grew out of}} Jesse Jackson's 1984 presidential campaign.

The goals of the campaign were to demand social programs, voting rights, <b>and</b> <b>affirmative</b> action for all groups that had been neglected by Reaganomics. Jackson's campaign blamed President Ronald Reagan's policies for reduction of government domestic spending, causing new unemployment and encouraging economic investment outside of the inner cities, while they discouraged the rebuilding of urban industry. The industrial layoffs caused by these policies hit the black and other minority populations particularly hard. At the 1984 Democratic National Convention on July 18, 1984, in San Francisco, California, Jackson delivered an address entitled [...] "The Rainbow Coalition". [...] The speech called for Arab Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, youth, disabled veterans, small farmers, lesbians and gays to join with African Americans and Jewish Americans for political purpose. Whereas the purpose of PUSH had been to fight for economic and educational opportunities, the Rainbow Coalition was created to address political empowerment and public policy issues. After his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination in 1984, Jackson attempted to build a broad base of support among groups that [...] "were hurt by Reagan administration policies" [...] - racial minorities, the poor, small farmers, working mothers, the unemployed, some labor union members, gays, and lesbians.|$|E
