The standalone CD artwork has Hamasaki holding {{the door to}} a red telephone box in Covent Garden, London, with the album title and her name superimposed on the booth. This marks Hamasaki's third album cover to be photographed and directed outside of Japan, after LOVEppears and (Miss)understood. The CD and music video DVD format has a close-up of Hamasaki's face, with parts of the British stripes <b>across</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> The box set is coloured black with the red British cross near the corner; the album version is the CD and DVD format, with the CD and DVD cover imprinted onto the mug, red tea tin, and the bag. The digital release uses the standalone CD format. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by Chow, and the design was based on Hamasaki's first visit to the UK and Britannia. First pressing issues for both the standalone CD format, the CD and DVD format, and the box set included a 36â€“page photo album of Hamasaki roaming the streets and wondering around stores and markets in London.|$|E
25|$|As {{the second}} verse begins, the singer {{is seen in}} an African hut lying on the floor, {{surrounded}} by female dancers. She performs on the floor, in one moment managing to put her leg over her head, before standing up and again, performing a dance routine. The performers are seen to make {{the shape of an}} eye, with Rihanna in the centre as the pupil. In this scene she wears a black lace ensemble with a new wild curly hairstyle. This is followed with the singer lying in a large birds' nest and then goes back to the singer with her previous wild hairstyle, performing a complex dance routine with female dancers, this time with fluorescent green effects. The penultimate scene shows Rihanna in a long dress which lights up neon red, while the singer has sequins <b>across</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> She then appears to channel Hindu god Shiva as multiple arms surround her body. In the final scene, Rihanna and her male background dancers seen previously, slowly descend back underwater into the swamp; Rihanna's head completely submerges below the water.|$|E

60|$|The pain of {{the blow}} seemed to rouse her. She rose, her loosed hair falling round her like a golden fleece, and a broad blue stripe <b>across</b> <b>her</b> ghastly <b>face.</b> She {{stretched}} out her hands; she opened her great eyes, and in them blazed the awful light of madness.|$|R

The couple then held a heavily promoted on-air wedding billed as [...] "The Match Made in Heaven" [...] at SummerSlam 1991 in New York's Madison Square Garden (the couple were officially married on December 30, 1984). At the wedding reception, Elizabeth opened a gift package containing a live snake, which frightened her; newly-turned-heel Jake [...] "The Snake" [...] Roberts and The Undertaker crashed the reception and attacked Savage. This started a feud between Roberts and Savage, where Elizabeth quickly figured prominently. The first high-profile Savage-Roberts match {{was at the}} Tuesday in Texas pay-per-view event, where, after Savage gained a pinfall victory, Roberts beat down Savage, then forced Elizabeth to beg him to stop the beating. Apparently dissatisfied with her begging, Roberts grabbed her by the hair and slapped her <b>across</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> On the February 8, 1992 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, Roberts, with a steel chair in tow, {{was waiting in the}} backstage area for Elizabeth and Savage to come through the curtain after a match. Roberts was about to strike Elizabeth with the chair, but Undertaker stopped him. This started Undertaker's feud with his former ally.|$|E
