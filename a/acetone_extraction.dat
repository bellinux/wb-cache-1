5000|$|Naturally {{occurring}} alcohol derivatives of capnellene {{have been}} isolated using simple <b>acetone</b> <b>extraction</b> from Capnella imbricata, {{a species of}} soft coral (order Alcyonacea) known as Kenya Tree Coral. Capnella is a widely distributed genus of soft coral, found primarily in the tropical reefs of Indonesia. [...] These corals produce a variety of sterols, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes. Specifically, the capnellanol derivatives found in Capnella serve as a defense system by inhibiting the growth of microorganisms and the settlement of larvae on the coral’s surface. [...] However, {{the details of this}} defense mechanism have not been extensively explored. Although the natural synthesis of capnellene and its derivatives is not yet understood, the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon precapnelladiene has been isolated from the same coral and research suggests that may be a biogenetic precursor.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout World War II, {{the allied}} forces {{suffered}} from a shortage of latex rubber, due to Japan cutting off America's access to the Maylasian rubber plantations. Spence, along with other allied scientists, scrambled to secure another natural rubber resource. Latex derived from Parthenium argentatum, more commonly called Guayule, was an ideal candidate as a replacement rubber due to {{the properties of the}} vulcanized rubber produced from Guayule, which were similar to the rubber produced from Maylasian rubber plantations. [...] Latex from Guayule was first prepared in 1876, via a solvent extraction of the latex using acetone, and this extraction process was used commercially by the Diamond Rubber Company up until the 1930s. [...] However, the <b>acetone</b> <b>extraction</b> process was too expensive to meet the large rubber demand brought on by World War II, creating a push to develop more conventional mechanical processing methods to extract the latex. [...] A significant production challenge in the production of latex from Guayule was that both the mass of the latex extracted, and the tensile strength of latex, fell off due to the long storage time between the harvesting of the Guayule and its processing. [...] Spence was tasked by Intercontinental Rubber to solve this challenge.Spence patented methodologies to both improve the quality and yield of rubber produced from Guayule via conventional mechanical techniques in 1933. [...] Upon investigation, Spence determined that the drying of the Guayule was responsible for the high variability in both the yield and quality of the latex. [...] Spence's retting processes of handling the Guayule shrub increased both the uniformity of the yield and the quality of rubber extracted from the Guayule plant. The retting process included soaking a crushed Guayule plant in a 1% para-dimethylphenylamine solution, in order for natural occurring bacteria and enzymes to decompose unwanted plant material into water-soluble by-products, and to prevent the oxidative loss of the plant's natural rubber. These by-products could then be washed away during the milling process. [...] The retting process improved the milling extraction process of Guayule upwards of six percent, and improved the tensile strength from 1800-2000 psi upwards of 2800 psi, a tensile strength comparable to that of the rubber trees.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} efficiency of methanol- and acetone-based solvents for {{the extraction of}} pigments from photosynthetic tissues of plant was compared, together with the advantages of multiple versus single extractions. The two commonly employed triple <b>acetone</b> <b>extractions</b> (100 : 80 : 80 % and 85 : 100 : 100 %) performed comparably for most pigments and for all plant species tested.

We conclude that multiple extractions that combine pure and aqueous (80 – 85 %) acetone are preferable for extraction of {{the full range of}} pigments. These results suggest that previous studies that have utilised aqueous methanol (especially in a single extraction) have probably underestimated the concentration of ?-carotene relative to other pigments...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY The {{presence}} of acetone-soluble renin inhibitors in normal plasma bas been proposed to ex-plain the variation of plasma renin reactivity (PRR) in samples from normotensive and hypertensive subjects. In our experience, <b>acetone</b> <b>extraction</b> decreased PRR {{in relation to}} unextracted control values, an observation which is {{not consistent with the}} circulating lipid-renin inhibitor hypothesis. Exposure to acetone at- 40 °C for 1 minute invariably denatured some endogenous angiotenslnogen. The PRR in extracted and unextracted plasma was positively correlated with the concentration of available angiotensinogen, r = 0. 955 (p < 0. 05), and r = 0. 964 (p < 0. 01), respectively, but the addition of exogenous substrate did not uniformly increase PRR in acetone-treated plasma above control values. These data argue against the use of <b>acetone</b> <b>extraction</b> to demonstrate the existence of circulating lipid-renin inhibitors. Acetone removed 14 % to 25 % of the normal plasma lipids and although the extract contained most of the major lipid classes, neutral lipids were the most abundant (73 % by weight). The {{presence of}} acetone-soluble phospholipids appeared to increase angiotensln I formation in the partially purified renin-angiotensinogen system, but phospholipids interfered with the radiolmmunoassay and resulted in an overestimation of angiotensln I.
