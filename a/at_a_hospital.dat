Brinkley transplanted goat testicles into 34 patients, including a judge, an alderman, a society matron and the chancellor of the now-defunct Chicago Law School (not {{to be confused with}} the University of Chicago Law School), all while the press looked on.

40|$|The clinicoeconomic {{efficiency}} of Stage 1 chemotherapy (CT) using different organizational forms of treatment was comparatively evaluated in 172 patients with new-onset pulmonary tuberculosis. The {{main reasons for}} ineffective CT were discontinued treatment (27. 1 to 10. 5 %) and a fatal outcome (13. 8 % <b>at</b> <b>an</b> around-the-clock <b>hospital).</b> Home hospital treatment showed the lowest rate of discontinued and refused treatments (10. 5 %). The cost of Stage 1 CT (90 bed-days) <b>at</b> <b>an</b> around-the-clock <b>hospital</b> was 49, 339 rubles. The highest clinicoeconomic {{efficiency of}} Stage 1 CT was noted during home hospital treatment: the rate of discontinued treatment was 2. 3 - 2. 5 times lower than that <b>at</b> <b>a</b> day <b>hospital</b> and around-the-clock hospital {{and the cost of}} ceased bacterial discharge verified by sputum microscopy was 8, 501 rubles, which was 6. 2 times less than that <b>at</b> <b>an</b> around-the-clock <b>hospital</b> and almost less than that <b>at</b> <b>a</b> day <b>hospital...</b>|$|R

5|$|On 26 October 1925, Houphouët {{began his}} career as a doctor's aide <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> in Abidjan, where he founded an {{association}} of indigenous medical personnel. This undertaking proved short-lived as the colonial administration viewed it unsympathetically, considering it a trade union. As a consequence, they decided to move Houphouët to a lesser hospital in Guiglo on 27 April 1927. After he proved his considerable talents, however, he was promoted on 17 September 1929 to a post in Abengourou, which until then had been reserved for Europeans.

5|$|After {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the {{proclamation}} of Indonesian independence in August 1945, the Japanese began {{withdrawing from the}} country. In support of the new Republic, Soegijapranata had an Indonesian flag flown {{in front of the}} Gedangan Rectory; however, he did not formally recognise the nation's independence, owing to his correspondence with Willekens regarding the Church's neutrality. He and his clergy treated injured Dutch missionaries, who had recently been released from internment, at the rectory. The Dutch clergy were malnourished, and several required treatment <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>hospital.</b> Some were later taken to Indonesian-run internment camps, but the Catholics were still allowed to look after them. Meanwhile, inter-religious strife led to the burning of several mission buildings and the murder of some clergymen. The government also took several buildings, and some that had been seized by the Japanese were not returned.|$|E
5|$|At around 7:00a.m. on 9 March 2014, the Mexican Army and Navy pinpointed Moreno González's {{whereabouts}} in Tumbiscatío, Michoacán.

Post-mortem reports indicated that Moreno González died of two gunshot wounds on his thorax. On 12 March 2014, his corpse was transferred to Morelia under tight security for further testing. At {{the time of his}} death, the drug lord was wanted by the Mexican government for charges relating to drug trafficking, organized crime, kidnapping, murder, and theft.|$|E
