40|$|Individuals with {{neuromuscular disease}} and {{restrictive}} pulmonary syndromes {{can benefit from}} the use of air stacking of mechanical insufflations, manually assisted coughing, and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for the clearing of airway secre-tions that would otherwise put the patient at risk for atelectasis, pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure. Some neuromuscular patients can also use glossopharyn-geal breathing to increase air stacking volumes. For many patients, mechanical insufflation-exsufflation, which may be used via an <b>anesthesia</b> <b>mask</b> or an endotra-cheal or tracheostomy tube, may be the only highly effective noninvasive method for clearing airway secretions. Peak cough expiratory flows (PCEF) generated dur-ing mechanical exsufflation can equal those that can be generated during the vigorous coughs of physically intact adults and exceed those that can be generated by assisted and unassisted coughing. No untoward effects or complications have been described for neuromuscular patients using this technique.

40|$|Background: Failure to {{ventilate}} patients by mask leads to serious complications especially if associated with difficult intubation. Previous studies have used subjective and indirect measures to evaluate difficulty in mask ventilation, which {{are associated with}} high inter-observer discrepancies. In this study, we have defined and used efficiency of mask ventilation (EMV) as an objective and direct surrogate for ease of mask ventilation in patients undergoing GA and mask ventilation using neuromuscular relaxation. Materials and Methods: 1050 adult patients prospectively were evaluated with respect to different patients demographic and physical factors and EMV. EMV {{was defined as the}} ratio of minute ventilation via <b>anesthesia</b> <b>mask</b> to that via tracheal tube expressed as percentage. Edentolous patients were ventilated using lip-over-mask techniques. Separate analyses were done for edentolous and non-edentolous patients. Results: EMV in edentolous patients (n= 269) using the lip-over-mask method was relatively high (90. 9 ± 14. 3 %, 60. 14 - 128. 57 range). The result of multiple regression analysis in patients with normal denture determined receded chin, presence of beard, male gender, high Mallampati classes, high neck circumference, low inter-incisors gap, and old age as independent factors for estimating EMV. A regression formula for predicting EMV was developed which had an acceptable R-square value with a good model fit. Conclusions: Using EMV is an easy and reliable tool for measuring efficiency of mask ventilation. Based on the result of this study, EMV can be estimated from patient′s demographic and physical factors. In edentolous patients, using the lip-over-mask method results in adequate ventilation of lungs...|$|E

40|$|High resolution, in vivo optical imaging of {{the mouse}} brain over time often {{requires}} anesthesia, which necessitates maintaining the animal's body temperature and level of anesthesia, as well as securing the head in an optimal, stable position. Controlling each parameter usually requires using multiple systems. Assembling multiple components into the small space on a standard microscope stage can be difficult and some commercially available parts simply do not fit. Furthermore, it is time-consuming to position an animal in the identical position over multiple imaging sessions for longitudinal studies. This is especially true when using an implanted gradient index (GRIN) lens for deep brain imaging. The multiphoton laser beam must be parallel with the shaft of the lens because even a slight tilt of the lens can degrade image quality. In response to these challenges, we have designed a compact, integrated in vivo imaging support system to overcome the problems created by using separate systems during optical imaging in mice. It is a single platform that provides (1) sturdy head fixation, (2) an integrated gas <b>anesthesia</b> <b>mask,</b> and (3) safe warm water heating. This THREE-IN-ONE (TRIO) Platform has a small footprint and a low profile that positions a mouse’s head only 20 mm above the microscope stage. This height is about one half to one third the height of most commercially available immobilization devices. We have successfully employed this system, using isoflurane in over 40 imaging sessions {{with an average of}} 2 h per session with no leaks or other malfunctions. Due to its smaller size, the TRIO Platform can be used with a wider range of upright microscopes and stages. Most of the components were designed in SOLIDWORKS® and fabricated using a 3 D printer.

40|$|Objectives: Acute {{lower limb}} {{ischemia}} caused by tumor embolization is rare, {{despite the fact}} that cancer is a common cause of hypercoagulability predisposing to venous thrombosis. Arterial embolization is mostly associated with intracardiac tumors while lung malignancies are the second most common cause of tumor embolism. Methods: In this report, we present a male patient who developed acute bilateral lower limb ischemia in the immediate postoperative period after a thoracotomy for attempted left upper lobe resection for lung cancer. Results: The patient was treated with a subclavian-bifemoral bypass, since an initial attempted embolectomy was unsuccessful. Histopathological characteristics of thrombus obtained during embolectomy were consistent with the histopathology of the primary tumor. Conclusion: Acute ischemia is an emergency that should be diagnosed and treated immediately. Interestingly, in this case, the presence of epidural <b>anesthesia</b> <b>masked</b> the initial symptoms and delayed diagnosis.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Local {{anesthesia}} with prilocaine {{has become}} a routine part of ambulatory circumcision procedures. Methemoglobinemia is a rare but potentially lethal complication of local anesthetics. Case presentation We report {{the case of a}} 40 -day-old Turkish boy who presented with cyanosis after receiving local anesthesia with prilocaine. His methemoglobin level revealed severe methemoglobinemia (methemoglobin = 44 %). His cyanosis resolved after intravenous administration of methylene blue. Conclusion Although the association between prilocaine use and methemoglobinemia has generally restricted the use of prilocaine in babies, it is still widely used in ambulatory procedures, especially during circumcision in the neonatal period. Prilocaine should not be used in babies who are less than 3 months old because of the risk of methemoglobinemia; other local anesthetics may be used for this age group. Furthermore, general <b>anesthesia</b> by <b>mask</b> ventilation may be favored for babies less than 3 months of age instead of local anesthetics. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Title: ORTHOPAEDIC TRAUMATOLOGIST PREFERENCE FOR USE OF REGIONAL ANESTHESIA IN FRACTURE MANAGEMENT. A SURVEY OF OTA MEMBERS. Abstract ID: 246 Abstract Category: Clinical Research Introduction:  Regional {{anesthesia}} (RA) {{is becoming}} more prevalent and mainstream as part of pain management protocols following operative procedures. Previous studies have documented the many advantages of its use including improved pain control, decreased opioid consumption, and shorter stays in the recovery room {{as well as the}} hospital. The specific use of RA in fracture care is controversial and the clinical decision as to which patients should receive this pain management technique is unclear. Often, orthopaedic trauma patients have evolving soft tissue injuries at the time of surgical intervention and therefore post-operative neurovascular function may need to be closely monitored. The question then arises; which patients with fractures can benefit from regional anesthesia while not putting the soft tissues at risk for adverse events such as compartment syndrome?  Purpose:To identify orthopaedic traumatologist preference for use of RA in fracture care. A secondary objective is to determine the prevalence of morbidity derived from regional anesthesia use in the trauma population.  Methods:  A prospective electronic survey was designed and a link placed on the Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) website. OTA members went through thirteen clinical scenarios involving lower extremity injuries that detailed patient age, mechanism of injury, and fracture pattern. Based on the clinical scenario, surveyors were given options of using regional anesthesia as part of the pain management plan or forgoing its use. If regional anesthesia was selected for the given clinical scenario, participants then chose between the use of spinal anesthesia, one shot peripheral nerve injection, or continuous nerve catheter infusion. For the last portion of the survey, surveyors were asked to complete questions pertaining to their clinical experience with regional <b>anesthesia</b> <b>masking</b> compartment syndrome or leading to increased patient morbidity due to a delayed diagnosis.  Results:  Over 90 % of OTA members viewed a high energy tibial plateau or tibial shaft fracture as a contraindication to any form of regional anesthesia. Preference for use of RA in other lower extremity fracture patterns varied significantly. Over 60 % of respondents have seen the use of RA delay or mask the diagnosis of compartment syndrome resulting in patient morbidity.  Conclusion:  The majority of OTA members viewed high energy tibial plateau and shaft fractures as contraindications to the use of regional anesthesia. The results have clinical as well as medico-legal implications in patient care and necessitates teamwork between anesthesiologists and orthopaedic surgeons appropriately risk stratify which patients can safely be administered RA...|$|R
40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease which is resulted from loss of dopaminergic neurones in the substantia nigra of the basal ganglia and is a characterized by the triad of resting tremor, muscle rigidity, and bradykinesia. PD is an important cause of perioperative morbidity and a major risk factor for postoperative complications in the elderly surgical patients. In these patients, the postoperative risks are determined {{with the presence of}} additional diseases, interaction of antiparkinsonian medication and anesthesic drugs. In the patients with PD, general <b>anesthesia</b> may <b>mask</b> neurological symptoms in the intraoperative period so the general anesthesia is preferred in these patients. Randomized clinical trials about the preference of anesthetic technique in the PD are not enough.

Therefore the concept of gasless laparoscopy is especially attractive for small children. The authors have developed an animal training model of gasless infant laparoscopy using the rabbit. Eleven New Zealand white rabbits (mean weight, 2. 2 kg) were premedicated with fentanyl (10 micrograms intramuscularly) and maintained under inhalation <b>anesthesia</b> by <b>mask,</b> with halothane (1. 0 to 2. 5 %) in oxygen and nitrous oxide (1 : 1).

30|$|We {{had three}} options {{to secure the}} patient’s airway during the operation: {{tracheal}} intubation using video laryngoscopy or fiberoptic bronchoscopy, SAD, or surgical tracheotomy. Each option had advantages and disadvantages. Tracheal intubation provides a secured airway against aspiration; however, this method may lead to prolonged intubation and/or subsequent surgical tracheotomy because of extubation difficulty. It seemed that intubation using video laryngoscopy or fiberoptic bronchoscopy was not difficult. It also seemed that the extubation after tracheal intubation would be difficult, as tracheal intubation might lead to mucosal edema. It {{is well known that}} intubation through the stenotic lesion may cause mucosal edema and further narrowing the airway [10]. The use of a SAD can minimize tracheal injury during anesthesia, although the use of a SAD does not provide complete aspiration protection. Surgical tracheotomy is the most invasive option, although it reduces the patient’s respiratory workload compared with tracheal intubation or the use of a SAD. Surgical tracheotomy should not be considered first choice due to the invasive feature. Regional anesthesia is ideal for anesthetic management of patients with subglottic stenosis if general anesthesia is not necessary [10]. Regional anesthesia was not possible in the present case, as the patient had difficulty in communication because of mental retardation and a hearing problem. When general anesthesia is necessary, we need to evaluate the possibility of mask ventilation under general <b>anesthesia.</b> If <b>mask</b> ventilation seems impossible, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered. In the present case, the previous anesthetic record showed that mask ventilation of the patient was possible. Therefore, we decided to induce general anesthesia.|$|R

Mask induction of animals is a common procedure. The present study investigates the efficiency of a novel scavenging double mask in reducing waste gas concentrations in the breathing zone of the anesthetist performing this procedure. Methods Twelve beagle dogs (ASA I) undergoing general anesthesia for a dental procedure were intravenously premedicated with medetomidine and butorphanol (10 μg/kg and 0. 2 mg/kg). Anesthesia was induced via a custom-made scavenging mask using isoflurane in oxygen. In six dogs (group S), scavenging from the mask was performed whereas in six other dogs (group NS) the scavenging function was disabled. Isoflurane concentration was continuously measured with photoacoustic spectroscopy {{at the level of the}} shoulder of the anesthetist before and during mask induction and additionally during intubation. Statistical analysis was performed with a Student t- test and a Mann-Whitney U test (p Results The mean isoflurane concentration during baseline (premedication) was 1. 8 ± 0. 8 ppm and 2. 3 ± 0. 6 ppm in group S and NS respectively. This increased during mask induction to 2. 0 ± 0. 8 ppm and 11. 2 ± 6. 0 ppm respectively (p Conclusion This double mask can be used to induce inhalation anesthesia in dogs. Scavenging from the mask significantly decreases the amount of waste anaesthetic gas concentrations in the breathing zone of the anesthetist.

The {{objective of this}} study was to extend the Blount method to fractures with substantial displacement even in patients presenting significant swelling and to evaluate the results. Patients and methodsWe conducted a prospective continuous study from December 2005 to August 2007 on 67 children: 49 boys and 18 girls with a mean age of 6  years (range, 3 – 14  years). The mean time lapsed from consultation to treatment was 30  h. The mean hospital stay was 72  h. In 50 children, the limb was elevated preoperatively for a mean 48  h. The fracture was reduced under fluoroscopy-guided general <b>anesthesia</b> with <b>mask</b> and immobilized with 5 -cm cloth banding padded with foam. The follow-up was clinical and radiological. The mean follow-up was 16  months (range, 6 – 26  months). Assessment followed the 1969 SOFCOT guidelines. ResultsAt union, mean flexion was 124 °, the mean extension lag was 26 °. At last follow-up, the mean flexion was 146 °, the extension lag was 0. 5 °, and pronation and supination were free.

40|$|Pulmonary edema {{secondary}} to postextubation laryn gospasm is a potentially life-threatening problem, de manding early diagnosis and prompt treatment. We {{believe that this}} problem has been grossly underesti mated in its incidence, as only seven adults {{have been reported in}} the English literature, whereas seven adults have been observed at our institution in only a 24 month period. All were young, healthy, athletic adult males (average weight, 218 pounds) who underwent relatively minor, uncomplicated surgical procedures under gen eral anesthesia. Five of these patients were collegiate and/or profes sional athletes and had meticulous medical records detailing their clinical course. Clinical laryngospasm was noted immediately following extubation and <b>anesthesia</b> by <b>mask</b> with subsequent pulmonary edema. The di agnoses were confirmed by clinical examination, arterial blood gas determinations or pulse oximetry, and chest roentgenogram. Four adults required reintubation. Six of the seven adults demonstrated very rapid resolution of the pulmonary edema with prompt diagnosis and institution of a therapeutic regimen including oxygen, diuretics, reintubation, and/or positive pressure venti lation. In one patient, the problem was not immediately recognized, and progressed to florid pulmonary edema requiring emergent intubation 14 hours later in the emergency room, and 3 days of mechanical ventilation. The etiology of pulmonary edema following upper airway obstruction represents an interplay between several factors: cardiogenic and neurogenic mecha nisms, as well as hypoxia contribute. In this group, excessive negative intrathoracic pressure generated by forced inspiration against a closed glottis is the most likely, consistent, and logical explanation. This study suggests that young, healthy, athletic males may be at increased risk for this complication. We believe that their enhanced ability to generate ex cessive negative intrathoracic pressures is, at least in part, responsible. A heightened awareness of the prob lem in this at-risk group should invoke special consid erations, including choice of anesthesia, precautions on extubation, prolonged monitoring in the recovery phase if laryngospasm is observed or suspected, and rapid therapeutic intervention...|$|R
40|$|Background. Prior {{studies in}} {{experimental}} canine models {{have demonstrated that}} intravenous cocaine administration causes myocardial depression. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to establish the mechanisms of cocaine's actions on myocardial and left ventricular performance after single intravenous bolus doses in conscious, chronically instrumented dogs, in which the full autonomic influences of cocaine would be manifest. Methods and Results. In the intact state, cocaine (1 mg/kg) caused a transient decrease in left ventricular dP/dt (baseline; 3, 086 ± 107 mm Hg/sec; 2. 5 minutes, 2, 649 ± 114 mm Hg; p< 0. 05) followed by a 25 ± 4 % increase in left ventricular dP/dt that peaked at 15 minutes (left ventricular dP/dt, 3, 751 127 mm Hg/sec, p< 0. 01) and remained elevated during the 30 -minute period of observation. Both the initial depression and the sustained increase in left ventricular contractile response were dose related. The increase in left ventricular dP/dt persisted under circumstances in which the responses were normalized for changes in heart rate and preload that accompanied cocaine administration. The positive inotropic effects were abolished by full autonomic or selective 3 -adrenergic blockades. Finally, both cardiac output (baseline, 2, 461 ± 142 min/mL; peak [5 minutes], 3, 434 ± 218 mL/min; p< 0. 05) and left ventricular stroke work (baseline, 39 ± 5 g * m; peak, 49 ± 6 g * m;p< 0. 05) were increased at all times after cocaine administration, suggesting that pump performance was enhanced, despite early reductions in myocardial contractility. Similarly, indexes of early diastolic filling were enhanced despite transient early prolongation in isovolumic relaxation. Conclusions. Acute intravenous cocaine administration (0. 1 - 2 mg/kg) has a biphasic effect on myocardial and left ventricular function with a transient depression followed by significant sustained increases in left ventricular contractility. The results are in keeping with an early local effect followed by significant adrenergic stimulation, which may be obscured by <b>anesthesia</b> or <b>masked</b> by changes in loading conditions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Original {{sevoflurane}} (Sevo A) is {{made with}} water, while a generic sevoflurane (Sevocris) is produced with propylene glycol as a stabilizing additive. We investigated whether the original and generic sevoflurane preparations differed {{in terms of their}} minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) values and hemodynamic effects. METHODS: Sixteen pigs weighing 31. 6 ± 1. 8 kg were randomly assigned to the Sevo A or Sevocris groups. After <b>anesthesia</b> induction via <b>mask</b> with the appropriate sevoflurane preparation (6 % in 100 % oxygen), the MAC was determined for each animal. Hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters were measured at 0. 5 MAC, 1 MAC and 1. 5 MAC. Histopathological analyses of lung parenchyma were performed. RESULTS: The MAC in the Sevo A group was 4. 4 ± 0. 5 %, and the MAC in the Sevocris group was 4. 1 ± 0. 7 %. Hemodynamic and metabolic parameters presented significant differences in a dose-dependent pattern as expected, but they did not differ between groups. Cardiac indices and arterial pressures decreased in both groups when the sevoflurane concentration increased from 0. 5 to 1 and 1. 5 MAC. The oxygen delivery index (DO 2 I) decreased significantly at 1. 5 MAC. CONCLUSION: Propylene glycol as an additive for sevoflurane seems to be as safe as a water additive, {{at least in terms of}} hemodynamic and pulmonary effects...|$|R
40|$|Anesthetic {{management}} of a parturient with respiratory failure associated with hemoptysis,dyspnea, and orthopnea is difficult. An anesthesiologist {{should realize that}} the patient'smajor problem is not solved during the surgery. This circumstance {{is similar to a}} patientwith associated cardiac disease scheduled for non-cardiac surgery. General anesthesia withendotracheal intubation can provide safe oxygenation for both the parturient and the fetus,but with possible unexpected massive hemoptysis and tumor seeding. Prolonged intubationmay delay the patient's pulmonary treatment course. Laryngeal <b>mask</b> <b>anesthesia</b> can providean airway, but must not be secured due to the risk of aspiration. The need of high doses ofinhalation drugs may hinder uterine contractions. The addition of a muscle relaxant willchange the patient's respiratory patterns and physiology. Regional anesthesia alone mightnot be tolerated. A decrease in cough strength, as well as dyspnea, orthopnea, and hyperventilationmay be harmful to both the parturient and the fetus. However, we successfullymanaged this case using epidural anesthesia combined with assisted mask ventilation insteadof spontaneous breathing usually provided by a simple mask in almost all American Societyof Anesthesiology (ASA) class I-II parturients during cesarean section. The anesthetic levelwas maintained at T 8 with 18 ml of 2 % Xylocaine mixed with 2 ml of 7 % sodium bicarbonatewith 1 : 200, 000 epinephrine epidurally and with the patient in a supine position with thehead up at 30 o to prevent cephalic spreading and to ensure better pulmonary ventilation...|$|R
40|$|Patients with diseased teeth, {{or those}} who are {{difficult}} to intubate, have {{a higher risk of}} dental injury during laryngoscopy. We report 3 cases of smooth endotracheal intubation using a paraglossal technique with a straight Miller blade in patients with poor dentition. Three patients with poor dentition were scheduled to undergo surgery under general anesthesia. All patients presented with extremely loose upper central incisors and had lost the other right upper teeth, while micrognathia and prominent, loose upper incisors were noted in 1 case. We elected to use a straight Miller blade using a paraglossal approach. A nasopharyngeal airway was inserted after induction of general <b>anesthesia</b> to facilitate <b>mask</b> ventilation and prevent air leakage from the mask. The Miller blade was then inserted from the right corner of the mouth, avoiding contact with the vulnerable incisors, and advanced along the groove between the tongue and tonsil. The endotracheal tube was subsequently smoothly inserted after obtaining a grade 1 Cormack and Lehane view without dental trauma in all 3 cases. Direct laryngoscopy using the paraglossal straight blade technique avoids dental damage in patients with mobile upper incisors and no right maxillary molars. It is a practical alternative method that differs from the traditional Macintosh laryngoscope in patients with a high risk of dental injury during the procedure. This technique, which provides an improved view of the larynx, might also be helpful with patients in whom intubation is difficult...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: A popular {{method of}} {{providing}} <b>anesthesia</b> for laryngeal <b>mask</b> airway (LMA) insertion {{is with the}} use of propofol. However, bolus propofol has been associated with adverse effects such as hypotension, apnea and pain on injection. Hence, time is needed to search an alternative. We aimed to compare the induction characteristics, ease of LMA insertion, hemodynamic changes and complications with inhalation of 8 % sevoflurane vital capacity breath and propofol. Material and Methods: A prospective randomized study of 60 American Society of Anesthesiologists' Grade I and II patients was conducted and distributed among two groups with 30 each undergoing gynecological procedures under general anesthesia. Group P received the injection propofol and Group S received sevoflurane. At the end point of induction, the LMA insertion was attempted. Scoring systems were used to grade the conditions for insertion of the LMA. Induction, LMA insertion characteristics, hemodynamic changes, complications were assessed. Data were recorded and analyzed. Comparison among the study groups was done with unpaired t-test, Mann–Whitney test and Chi-square test. Results: Sevoflurane took a longer time for induction and for LMA insertion than propofol. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups, with respect to LMA insertion characteristics, heart rate, mean arterial pressure. It is concluded that sevoflurane is associated with good hemodynamic stability and may prove useful incases where propofol is to be avoided. However, the ease of insertion provided with propofol is better...|$|R
40|$|Post-operative {{sore throat}} {{is one of}} the most common {{complications}} and complaints of patients after general anesthesia especially in operations that need endotracheal intubations. Its causes are: size of endotracheal tube and type of its cuff, inadequate airway humidification, trauma during intubation and suctioning, high flow of inspiratory gases, surgical manipulation of airway and adjacent organs, ect. Use of instruments with less invasion to upper respiratory tract, for example, face mask and airway, LMA or CPT are methods, used for decreasing the rate of post-operative sore throat. This study was performed to compare the rate of sore throat after general <b>anesthesia</b> between Laryngeal <b>Mask</b> Airway (LMA) and Cuffed Pharyngeal Tube (CPT). From the patients, 120 ASA: PS-I cases, were selected, who were candidates for elective surgery of Orthopedics, Urology, General surgery and Gynecology in Hazrat Rasool-Akram Hospital Complex in the year 2000. Their operation were performed in supine position and did not need muscle relaxation and the patients had spontaneous breathing. Duration of surgery was less than 2 hours. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups: LMA was used for one group and CPT for others. Immediately after operation, in the recovery room and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours after removing the tube, the patients were asked about sore throat and the results were recorded in the related sheets. The results was 31. 7 percent of patients in group LMA and 0 percent of patients in group CPT, had sore throat. There were significant difference between groups (LMA and CPT) in presentation of sore throat (P&lt; 0. 001) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} {{is the most}} common entrapment neuropathy in humans today. For patients in whom conservative treatment fails, surgical decompression is indicated. Among the various surgical techniques currently in use, endoscopic techniques are becoming increasingly popular. Due to the rapid postoperative recovery shown after endoscopic operations, midpalmar accurate incision for carpal tunnel release is a comparative alternative. Methods: From February 1998 through January 2003, 84 patients had undergone 96 midpalmar carpal tunnel releases with accurate skin incisions under regional block or general <b>mask</b> <b>anesthesia.</b> The postoperative evaluations were per-formed via subjective assessment with a standardized telephone interview over an average follow-up period of 22. 4 months. Results: The average operation time was 16 minutes (range, 5 to 40 minutes). A total of 87 hands (91 %) had excellent or good recovery in terms of symptom relief (improvement of 70 % or greater). The incidence of postoperative sensory morbidity, i. e., pillar pain or scar tenderness, was 7 % (7 hands). The motor functional morbidity of a persistent subjective decrease in grip strength was noted in 8 % (8 hands), and the mean period for returning to work was 4. 5 weeks. In addition, no operation-induced neurovascular or tendinous injury occurred in any patient. Conclusions: The outcomes were similar to those of endoscopic carpal tunnel release. Based on these results, midpalmar carpal tunnel release with accurate loca-tion of skin incision is as effective as any other surgical procedures for carpal tunnel release. Furthermore, it is also a safe and simple procedure...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Perioperative {{adverse events}} {{are more common}} in {{children}} compared to adult population. Reporting an adverse event proves effective in identifying problems and helps in prevention and early management. Our objective was to identify the types, incidence, {{and the time of}} occurrence of perioperative adverse event. We also aimed to find out whether the occurrence of the types of adverse events differs in children below and above five years. &# 13; Methods: This was a prospective study in 242, ASA Physical Status I and II children aged day one to 14 years, receiving general <b>anesthesia</b> with laryngeal <b>mask</b> airway for various elective surgeries. Adverse events observed in the perioperative period were recorded. &# 13; Results: Adverse events related to respiratory system (n= 26, 55 %) were the most common followed by cardiovascular system (n= 14, 30 %). Adverse events were observed in 24 (10 %) children in the operating room and in 20 (8 %) children in the post anaesthesia care unit. In the operating room, majority (14 of 27, 52 %) of the events occurred immediately after removal of laryngeal mask airway. Respiratory events were more common in children below five years (p= 0. 007), whereas cardiac events were more common in children above five years (p= 0. 02). &# 13; Conclusions: The commonest adverse event in children is related to respiratory system. Adverse events occur more frequently in the operating room, mostly immediately after removal of laryngeal mask airway. Respiratory events are more frequent in children below five years whereas cardiac events are more frequent in children above five years. &# 13; Keywords: adverse events; children; laryngeal mask airway; laryngospasm; perioperative...|$|R
