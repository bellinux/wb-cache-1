25|$|The castle may be {{approached}} from two directions. From Llangollen the path starts from Canal Bridge and runs beside Ysgol Dinas Brân. It gradually climbs past several cottages before opening {{out onto the}} lower slopes of the hill. A zigzag path then climbs to the summit. The other route starts from 'Offa's Dyke Path' on the north {{western side of the}} hill. This route is shorter but steeper. Official <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> equip yourself with stout walking shoes and warm, waterproof clothing before climbing to the castle.|$|E
500|$|It is {{difficult}} to appreciate the condition of Greek slaves. According to Aristotle, the daily routine of slaves could {{be summed up in}} three words: [...] "work, discipline, and feeding". Xenophon's <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> treat slaves as domestic animals, that is to say punish disobedience and reward good behaviour. For his part, Aristotle prefers to see slaves treated as children and to use not only orders but also recommendations, as the slave is capable of understanding reasons when they are explained.|$|E

50|$|According to Livy, the Samnites had no {{idea what}} to do to take {{advantage}} of their success. Hence Pontius <b>was</b> persuaded <b>to</b> send a letter to his father, Herennius. The reply came back that the Romans should be sent on their way, unharmed, as quickly as possible. This <b>advice</b> <b>was</b> rejected, and a further letter <b>was</b> sent <b>to</b> Herennius. This time the <b>advice</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> kill the Romans down to the last man.|$|R
500|$|This myth {{was derived}} from two misconceptions: First, that tornadoes always travel in a northeasterly direction, and second, that debris from a {{structure}} will be carried away {{in the direction of}} the tornado's propagation, leaving anyone taking shelter on the side of the structure facing the tornado's approach unharmed. The seriousness of these misconceptions began to be revealed in the 1960s and 1970s, when surveys of major tornado damage in residential areas showed that the section of a house {{in the direction of the}} tornado's approach is actually the [...] safe. Additionally, many tornadoes have traveled in directions other than northeasterly, including the Jarrell Tornado (F5 on the Fujita scale), which moved south-southwesterly. Because determining a tornado's direction of approach can take time away from seeking shelter, official <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> seek shelter in an interior room on the lowest floor of a building, under a staircase, I-beam, or sturdy piece of furniture if possible.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cornerstone}} {{of the program is}} the Thursday broadcast of [...] "Leykis 101", in which the program is set up as an ad hoc lecture and question and answer session, over which Leykis presides as a self-styled [...] "professor". The subject of the [...] "101" [...] segments are how men can spend less money on women, while achieving greater sexual and personal success. The intent of his <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> serve as a father figure for his mostly-male listeners. Thus, many callers address Leykis as [...] "Dad" [...] or [...] "Father".|$|E
2500|$|In 1873 Darwin's son George {{wrote an}} essay which boldly {{dismissed}} prayer, divine morals and [...] "future rewards & punishments".

It is an old doctrine of mine {{that it is of}} foremost importance for a young author to publish.. only what is very good & new... remember that an enemy might ask who is this man... that he should give to the world his opinions on the deepest subjects?... but my <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> pause, pause, pause." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under Ultimate rules, {{a player}} may catch the frisbee {{with one or}} two hands. A catch can grab the rim, or {{simultaneously}} grab {{the top and bottom of}} the frisbee -- in a clap-catch / [...] "pancake catch". Care is needed with the hand placement when catching with one hand on the disc rim, making sure to catch on the proper side of the disc, according to which way the disc is spinning. When a frisbee is thrown at high speeds, as is frequently the case in a competitive Ultimate game, one side of the frisbee can spin out of the player's hand, and the other side can spin into their hand, which can make a catch far more secure. [...] For this reason, along with the desire to secure the frisbee strongly and [...] "cleanly," [...] the general <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> for a two hands when possible.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{returning}} to Halifax, Desmond discussed {{the matter with}} her husband, and his <b>advice</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> let it go.

2500|$|Royal Mint surveys {{estimate}} {{the proportion of}} counterfeit £1 coins in circulation. This was estimated at 3.04% in 2013, a rise from 2.74%. The figure previously announced in 2012 was 2.86%, following the prolonged rise from 0.92% in 2002–2003 to 0.98% in 2004, 1.26% in 2005, 1.69% in 2006, 2.06% in 2007, 2.58% in 2008, 2.65% in 2009, 3.07% in 2010 and 3.09% in 2011. Figures have generally {{been reported in the}} following year; in 2008 (as reported in 2009), the highest levels of counterfeits were in Northern Ireland (3.6%) and the South East and London (2.97%), with the lowest being in Northwest England. Coin testing companies estimated in 2009 that the actual figure was about twice the Mint's estimate, suggesting that the Mint was underplaying the figures so as not to undermine confidence in the coin. It is illegal to pass on counterfeit currency knowingly; the official <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> hand it in, with details of where received, to the police, who will retain it and investigate. One article suggested [...] "given that fake coins are worthless, you will almost certainly be better off not even looking". The recipient has recourse against the supplier, as in any such case.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next step}} in the {{learning}} to read process is the novice reading stage [...] also known as selective association. [...] This begins with the child learning to decode print and understanding the meaning of what has been decoded. To do this, the child must first figure out the Alphabetic principle and master it in only a few years. Most children know that the words on a page in a book mean something, but do not readily understand how the letters code the meaning. [...] They know that these words are made of the sounds of their particular language, and that letters convey these sounds. [...] Novice readers learn to hear and manipulate the smaller sounds into syllables and words. If a child is able to master this skill, called phonological awareness, {{it is one of the}} best predictors of a child's success in learning to read. One way that you can teach children to become more aware of sounds within words is through such things as nursery rhymes that enhance the child's ability to hear and divide the structure of words. [...] Another way to teach a child to read is through little [...] "games" [...] in which the sounds in word are either clapped, written or danced to a beat. A novice reader will also memorize the most common letter patterns in their own language and most of the frequent words that will not necessarily follow the phonological rules such as in English the words [...] "have" [...] and [...] "who". It is in this stage that children will develop a vocabulary of words that is between 2,500 and 5,000 words. Children's vocabularies continue to grow as they enter elementary school, since they will continue to learn new words at a rate of about seven words per day. This shows that at this stage in reading the best piece of <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> just practice, practice, practice or read, read more, and read again.|$|E

Advice may pertain to relationships, lifestyle changes, legal choices, business goals, personal goals, career goals, education goals, religious beliefs, personal growth, motivation, inspiration and so on. <b>Advice</b> <b>is</b> not pertinent <b>to</b> any solid criteria, and may be given freely, or only given when asked upon.
