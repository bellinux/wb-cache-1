50|$|Prebaked anodes {{are divided}} into {{graphitized}} and coke types. For manufacturing of the graphitized anodes, anthracite and petroleum coke are calcined and classified. They are then mixed with coal-tar pitch and pressed. The pressed green anode is then baked at 1200 °C and graphitized. Coke anodes are made of calcined petroleum coke, recycled <b>anode</b> <b>butts,</b> and coal-tar pitch (binder). The anodes are manufactured by mixing aggregates with coal tar pitch to form a paste with a doughy consistency. This material is most often vibro-compacted but in some plants pressed. The green anode is then sintered at 1100-1200 °C for 300-400 hours, without graphitization, to increase its strength through decomposition and carbonization of the binder. Higher baking temperatures increase the mechanical properties and thermal conductivity, and decrease the air and CO2 reactivity. The specific electrical resistance of the coke-type anodes is {{higher than that of}} the graphitized ones, but they have higher compressive strength and lower porosity.|$|R
40|$|Spent <b>anodes,</b> {{denominated}} <b>butts</b> in {{the aluminum}} industry, are recycled {{as part of}} the raw material used to produce new anodes. The fragmentation of the butt generates some sodium-rich powder, which is captured and included in the recycled material. This paper evaluates the influence of sodium content on anode reactivity. Six formulations with 0 to 25 % butt powder were used. An average increase of 48 ppm of sodium from one to another formulation caused average increments of 3. 38 and 2. 72 % for air and CO 2 reactivity, respectively. The quality-related figures varied from 1. 34 to 1. 12 for CO 2 and from 1. 10 to 0. 62 for air, showing quality loss in higher sodium content and higher impact on air reactivity. The Fischer formula predicted a carbon specific consumption of - 48. 47 kg. t- 1 Al for baked carbon anodes with 127 ppm to 367 ppm of sodium content, showing that the sodium can cause relevant carbon losses and increase costs of the aluminum production...|$|R
40|$|In the Hall-Héroult {{process for}} primary {{production}} of aluminium, {{a considerable amount}} of anode carbon is lost through unwanted gasification in air and CO 2. The carbon gasification reactions are catalyzed by a number of inorganic impurities normally present in the anodes. Some of these impurities follow the anode raw materials while others are introduced during the anode manufacturing process. The aim of this work is to obtain a fundamental knowledge of how the bath compounds: AlF 3, Al 2 O 3, NaF, Na 3 AlF 6 and CaF 2, which may be introduced in various amounts to prebaked anodes through the addition of recycled <b>anode</b> <b>butts,</b> influence the air and CO 2 reactivity of anode carbon. In order to avoid the disturbing and possibly masking effect of other impurities normally present in industrial anode materials, this work uses cokes made by carbonization of high purity carbon precursors (tar oil/petroleum pitch) in a laboratory scale coke reactor. Known amounts of fluoride salts or the corresponding metal acetylacetonates are added to the liquid precursor prior to carbonization. “High”-sulfur cokes are prepared by also adding 4. 5 weight percent dibenzothiophene to the precursor (corresponds to an addition of 1 wt% elemental sulfur). The calcined coke samples are characterized in terms of reactivity towards air and CO 2 gasification, size and shape of optical texture units and degree of turbostratic order. Scanning electron microscopy and surface area measurements are used to study the surface textural changes resulting from the catalyzed gasification. The extent of gasification inside industrial prebaked and Søderberg anodes is investigated by characterizing anode core samples in terms of air permeabilities, contamination profiles and reactivities towards air and CO 2 gasification. The characteristics are related to findings from electron microscopy examinations. COKES DOPED WITH SODIUM ACETYLACETONATE, SODIUM FLUORIDE AND CRYOLITE Sodium acetylacetonate decomposes completely to sodium carbonate during carbonization and calcination of the coke samples. At the initial stages of gasification, the sodium carbonate particles decompose to a sodium oxide phase, which catalyzes the air and CO 2 gasification reactions strongly. Sodium fluoride and cryolite also act as strong gasification catalysts. Due to formation of higher amounts of inhibiting fluorine gases (COF 2, AlOF 2), the cryolite doped cokes are less reactive than the corresponding sodium fluoride cokes. The difference between the two coke series is especially pronounced during air gasification. The air reactivity of the sodium-doped cokes is markedly reduced when 4. 5 weight percent dibenzothiophene is added to the coke precursors prior to carbonization. During carbonization, the sulfur is stabilized in large aromatic molecules and it is only liberated when the carbon matrix is gasified. The free sulfur adsorbs on the active sites of the sodium particles and lowers their catalytic activity. The Na-S adsorption complexes are thermally unstable at the CO 2 gasification temperature (960 °C) and the CO 2 gasification rates are therefore not affected by the dibenzothiophene additions.

There are no cocatalytic effects between calcium and sodium i. e. the catalytic activity of calcium is not affected by the concurrent presence of sodium and vice versa. GAS REACTIVITY OF INDUSTRIAL ANODES The carbon dioxide produced at the anode working surface, percolates through the open porosity of the anodes and reacts with accessible carbon in the lower parts. Airburn is mainly of concern at the exposed parts of prebaked anodes (anode tops and the sides near the tapping positions) and under the gas skirts of the Søderberg anodes. From air permeability measurements and electron microscopy examinations, internal CO 2 gasification is found to occur in the lower 3 – 5 cm of prebaked anodes. Depending on the anode top surface temperature, air gasification may occur as deep as 4 cm below the anode top surface. In Søderberg anodes the extent of internal CO 2 gasification strongly depends on the gas permeability of the anode. In high-permeability Søderberg anodes, CO 2 gasification may occur as far as 60 cm above the working surface. Higher up, the temperature is normally too low for gasification. In some particular low-permeability Søderberg anodes (permeability resembling “bad” prebaked anodes), internal CO 2 gasification is limited to the lower 15 – 20 cm of the anodes. In both prebaked and Søderberg anodes, the more reactive binder coke is selectively gasified. Since much of the binder phase in the lower parts of the high-permeability Søderberg anodes is consumed, substantial dusting is expected from the working surface of these anodes. In the prebaked anodes, the binder phase is mostly structurally intact. Catalytically active sodium and calcium impurities are mainly introduced to prebaked anodes via the addition of butts. Pot-room dust is an important contamination source in Søderberg anodes. Additionally, the lower parts of especially the high-permeability Søderberg anodes are contaminated by gaseous sodium and aluminium bath species that penetrates into the anode open porosity and condense within the anodes. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
