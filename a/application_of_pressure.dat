5|$|Samarium forms {{trivalent}} sulfide, selenide and telluride. Divalent chalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe with cubic rock-salt {{crystal structure}} are also known. They are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic state {{at room temperature}} upon <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure.</b> Whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about 20–30kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5kbar. This effect results in spectacular color change in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished. The transition does not change lattice symmetry, {{but there is a}} sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume. It shows hysteresis, that is when the pressure is released, SmS returns to the semiconducting state at much lower pressure of about 0.4 kbar.|$|E

25|$|Cyclohexane has two {{crystalline}} phases. The high-temperature phase I, stable between 186 K and {{the melting}} point 280 K, is a plastic crystal, {{which means the}} molecules retain some rotational degree of freedom. The low-temperature (below 186 K) phase II is ordered.

25|$|Despite {{its wide}} band gap of about 8.35 eV at 80 K, caesium {{chloride}} weakly conducts electricity, and the conductivity is not electronic but ionic. The conductivity has {{a value of}} the order 10−7 S/cm at 300°C. It occurs through nearest-neighbor jumps of lattice vacancies, and the mobility is much higher for the Cl− than Cs+ vacancies. The conductivity increases with temperature up to about 450°C, with an activation energy changing from 0.6 to 1.3 eV at about 260°C. It then sharply drops by two orders of magnitude because of the phase transition from the α-CsCl to β-CsCl phase. The conductivity is also suppressed by <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> (about 10 times decrease at 0.4 GPa) which reduces the mobility of lattice vacancies.|$|E

2500|$|SCO is also {{influenced}} by the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> which changes {{the population of the}} HS and LS states. [...] Upon <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure,</b> a conversion from the HS state to the LS state and a shift from T1/2, (the temperature at which half of the complex is in a LS state), to higher temperatures will occur. [...] This is due to an increase in the zero point energy difference, ΔE°HL, caused by an increase in the relative vertical displacement of the potential wells and a decrease in the activation energy, ΔW°HL, which favors the LS state. Figure 14 shows a schematic of the pressure influence on an FeII-L compound and Figure 15 shows the effect of pressure on the magnetic susceptibility of Fe(phen)2(SCN)2. At high pressures the LS state predominates and the transition temperature increases. At high pressures the compound is almost entirely transformed to the LS state at room temperature.

2500|$|In {{situations}} where direct pressure and elevation are either not possible or proving ineffective, {{and there is}} a risk of exsanguination, some training protocols advocate the use of pressure points to constrict the major artery that feeds the point of the bleed. [...] This is usually performed at a place where a pulse can be found, such as in the femoral artery. [...] There are significant risks involved in performing pressure point constriction, including necrosis of the area below the constriction, and most protocols give a maximum time for constriction (often around 10 minutes). [...] There is particularly high danger if constricting the carotid artery in the neck, as the brain is sensitive to hypoxia and brain damage can result within minutes of <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure.</b> Pressure on the carotid artery can also cause vagal tone induced bradycardia, which can eventually stop the heart.
