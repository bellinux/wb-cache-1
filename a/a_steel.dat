5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ric Flair defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Triple H inside <b>a</b> <b>Steel</b> Cage, which gained 83% of the vote. During the match, Triple H sent Flair head-first into the steel cage, bloodying Flair's from the head. In one point, Triple H {{retrieved}} <b>a</b> <b>steel</b> chain, {{wrapped it around}} his fist and attempted a diving fist drop from the top turnbuckle. However, Flair countered, raising his foot to Triple H's face and performed a series of knife edged chops. Triple H controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the figure four leglock, a signature move of Flair's, resulting in Flair sending him towards the steel cage. After that, Flair bit Triple H's head, bloodying him from his forehead, this often results when a wrestler is trapped, either {{in a corner of}} the ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move. The match ended when Flair reversed a Pedigree with a back body drop and hit Triple H with <b>a</b> <b>steel</b> chair thrice, allowing Flair to escape through the steel cage door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental title.|$|E

Meanwhile, Killings cracked his front teeth after falling face-first onto <b>a</b> <b>steel</b> chair.|$|E
