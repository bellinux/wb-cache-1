5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein {{is defined by the}} sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often <b>associate</b> <b>to</b> form stable protein complexes.|$|E

5|$|Following No Mercy, the storyline between JBL and The Undertaker ended. JBL {{was then}} {{placed in a}} new angle against Booker T. On an episode of SmackDown!, a six-man tag team match {{involving}} Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Rey Mysterio taking on JBL, Kenzo Suzuki, and René Duprée was scheduled. At the time, Booker T being a villain, congratulated JBL with the success that he has accomplished within the company in a segment backstage. The tag team match got underway, and JBL was {{led to believe that}} Booker was going to betray his tag partners, as Booker warned both Van Dam and Mysterio not to interfere with him during the match. The match concluded with Booker pinning JBL for the win, thus turning Booker into a crowd favorite. The following week on SmackDown!, Booker defeated Orlando Jordan, JBL's <b>associate,</b> <b>to</b> earn the right to face JBL for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series. At Survivor Series, JBL defeated Booker to retain the WWE title.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible {{competitive}} antagonists also involve {{competition between}} the agonist and antagonist of the receptor, but the rate of covalent bonding differs and depends on affinity and reactivity of the antagonist. For some antagonist, {{there may be a}} distinct period during which they behave competitively (regardless of basal efficacy), and freely <b>associate</b> <b>to</b> and dissociate from the receptor, determined by receptor-ligand kinetics. But, once irreversible bonding has taken place, the receptor is deactivated and degraded. As for non-competitive antagonists and irreversible antagonists in functional assays with irreversible competitive antagonist drugs, there may be a shift in the log concentration–effect curve to the right, but, in general, both a decrease in slope and a reduced maximum are obtained.|$|E
5|$|Late {{one night}} in 1997, Boston Herald {{reporter}} Tom Mashberg was driven to a warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn by William Youngworth {{to see what was}} purported to be The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. Youngworth was a career criminal and <b>associate</b> <b>to</b> New England art thief Myles Connor Jr. Mashberg had been investigating the theft and was briefly allowed to view the painting with a flashlight. He was given a vial of paint chips for authenticity. These were later confirmed by experts to be fragments of Dutch 17th-century origin—but not from the stolen painting. It was never concretely determined to be real or fake, and the FBI quit speaking to Youngworth after not making any progress. The painting has since disappeared.|$|E

5|$|Proteins can <b>associate</b> <b>to</b> form protein complexes, these often {{contain a}} set of {{proteins}} with similar functions, such as enzymes that carry out several steps in the same metabolic pathway. This organization can allow substrate channeling, which is when the product of one enzyme is passed directly to the next enzyme in a pathway without being released into solution. Channeling can make a pathway more rapid and efficient {{than it would be}} if the enzymes were randomly distributed in the cytosol, and can also prevent the release of unstable reaction intermediates. Although a wide variety of metabolic pathways involve enzymes that are tightly bound to each other, others may involve more loosely associated complexes that are very difficult to study outside the cell. Consequently, the importance of these complexes for metabolism in general remains unclear.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The study aims to {{demonstrate}} the techniques employed in surgery of the brachial plexus that are <b>associated</b> <b>to</b> evidence-based improvement of the functional outcome of these patients. METHOD: A retrospective study of one hundred cases of traumatic brachial plexus injuries. Comparison between the postoperative outcomes <b>associated</b> <b>to</b> some different surgical techniques was demonstrated. RESULTS: The technique of proximal nerve roots grafting was <b>associated</b> <b>to</b> good results in about 70 % of the cases. Significantly better outcomes were <b>associated</b> <b>to</b> the Oberlin's procedure and the Sansak's procedure, while the improvement of outcomes <b>associated</b> <b>to</b> phrenic to musculocutaneous nerve and the accessory to suprascapular nerve transfer did not reach statistical significance. Reinnervation of the hand was observed in less than 30 % of the cases. CONCLUSION: Brachial plexus surgery renders satisfactory results for reinnervation of the proximal musculature of the upper limb, however the same good outcomes are not usually <b>associated</b> <b>to</b> the reinnervation of the hand...|$|R
