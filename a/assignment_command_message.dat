50|$|The FOX {{messaging}} system simplifies the GUI update strategy: during widget update, the widgets can ask from their targets to update them. This {{means that a}} <b>command</b> <b>message</b> does not also have to explicitly update any widgets as it is typical. In case an application implements N <b>command</b> <b>messages</b> each updating M widgets, then M*N updates must be executed and at most M*N messages must be implemented. On the other hand, if widgets request for update, only N <b>command</b> <b>messages</b> and at most M update messages are implemented. This strategy separates the GUI update from data changes, making the GUI a real-time reflection of the underlying data structures.|$|R

30|$|BO {{reduction}} at neighboring coordinators {{is performed}} {{prior to the}} arrival of mobile node in their cluster. In PRA, the parent coordinator broadcasts this BO information using decrease beacon interval (DBI) <b>command</b> <b>message</b> [15]. DBI message is transmitted by the coordinator because of the following reasons. Firstly, in WPANs, RFDs have limited energy resources and conserving energy is the most important objective. Therefore, coordinator (FFD) transmits DBI message instead of RFD. Secondly, in beacon-enabled IEEE 802.15. 4 networks, during re-association, RFDs discover the network using passive scan and do not explicitly request for beacons. Since PRA complements and optimizes the performance of beacon-enabled IEEE 802.15. 4, transmission of DBI messages by RFDs is not appropriate. Lastly, the coordinator performs PRD; thus, it transmits the DBI <b>command</b> <b>message.</b>|$|R
30|$|Configuration {{messages}} are {{of three different}} types: CFG- 1, CFG- 2 and CFG- 3. CFG- 1 represents the reporting capability of PMU in terms {{of different types of}} data and is of 100 bytes. CFG- 2 gives information about the synchrophasor measurements which are currently being transmitted/reported and it is 100 bytes. CFG- 3 contains some enhanced flexibility and information about characteristics and measurements that are being sent by a PMU and its size is 110 bytes. The header messages which are 18 bytes contain the readable descriptive information sent from PMU/PDC. <b>Command</b> <b>messages</b> control operation of synchrophasor measurement devices and the transmission of data configuration and header messages and has a size of 20 bytes.

30|$|After {{calculating the}} set of links {{that needs to be}} measured, the host of the {{algorithm}} (generally a laptop) sends <b>command</b> <b>messages</b> to the wireless nodes through the base station node to tell them when to participate in the measurement and when to go to sleep. Therefore, in the real-time system, the nodes have two phases: one for measurement and the other for receiving <b>command</b> <b>messages</b> from the host computer. In the phase of measurement, the nodes are synchronized and time slots are assigned by the following scheme. In 1 cycle of measurement, the total number of slots {{is the same as the}} number of the nodes. Each node is assigned to transmit only in the slot in which the serial number is equal to its node ID number; in other slots, the node either receives messages from another node for measurement the RSS of the link or keeps radio in sleep phase to save power. The packet transmitted by a node includes the ID of the node and the RSS values that it has already measured. In the measurement phase, the base station node receives all the data packets and sends them to the host computer. Hence, when the last node has sent its data packet, the host computer has all the RSS values of the correlated links. Then the wireless node will turn to the second phase. All of them will keep alive and receive <b>command</b> <b>messages</b> from the base station node. Simultaneously, the host computer will use the measured RSS vector to estimate the target’s location with Algorithm 2.|$|R
