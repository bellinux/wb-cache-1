25|$|The work at Dartford thus {{came to a}} halt. In {{a report}} in 1581 Schutz' design for the Dartford furnace was blamed, but recent modern {{research}} has shown that the real problem was that the 1400 tonnes of ore brought back to England from Baffin Island were not gold-bearing. Hogarth concluded that since Schutz had attempted to buy all the ore himself, he was unlikely to have tampered with the tests, and the 'inescapable conclusion' is that the <b>assay</b> <b>method</b> was at fault, perhaps because of contamination from additives necessarily used in the process. McDermott also notes that Schutz' original test while he was on Countess of Warwick Island had been on a 'rich red ore' from Jonas' Mount, but little of that ore was brought back on the 1577 voyage because the ships were already laden with black ore before the red ore was found, and Frobisher did not mine at Jonas' Mount on the 1578 voyage. Moreover, the original black stone had been found by Garrard on Hall's Island during the 1576 voyage, and according to Michael Lok's account, no ore was discovered during a search of Hall's Island on the second voyage of 1577, and Frobisher 'never after brought home one stone more of that rich ore which he brought in the first voyage, for there was none of it to be found'.|$|E

40|$|Thymineless {{death has}} been studied in four {{different}} Thy− strains of Escherichia coli by using various <b>assay</b> <b>methods</b> including conventional plating techniques {{as well as one}} performed entirely in liquid medium.

This indicated that cellular damage responsible for the additional killing on L agar is reversible. The results obtained by three other <b>assay</b> <b>methods,</b> the liquid <b>assay,</b> plating on nutrient agar, or plating on tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane-minimal agar, did not differ significantly from each other with all strains tested except strain JG 151.

40|$|The glycophorin A (GPA) assay for in vivo {{somatic cell}} {{mutations}} {{was performed on}} blood samples from 39 survivors {{of the atomic bomb}} at Hiroshima. Parallel analyses were performed at two laboratories using three different GPA <b>assay</b> <b>methods</b> to enumerate cells lacking expression of either the M- or N-allele of GPA. All <b>assay</b> <b>methods</b> yielded significant dose-dependent increases in hemizygous GPA variant cell frequencies (VFs) and smaller increases in homozygous VFs. The slopes of the fitted linear dose-response functions did not differ significantly among <b>assay</b> <b>methods</b> used in the present study, or from slopes obtained in a study reported previously. The version of the assay described most recently (BR 6) appears best suited for future studies because the assay has a higher precision than earlier methods. Variant frequencies from different <b>assay</b> <b>methods</b> measuring the same variant cell type agreed with each other better than with the estimated dose, suggesting that the imprecision in the assay is not primarily responsible for VFs that differ from the fitted dose response. Consistent deviations from the dose response were seen for some individuals, suggesting either errors in dose estimates for these individuals or interindividual differences in susceptibility or other exposures. For the study population as a whole, however, discrepancies between assays for M-loss and N-loss variants suggest stochastic factors may have an important effect on individual VFs for A-bomb survivors...|$|R
