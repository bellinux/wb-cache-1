Traditionally, men who were graduated first in the class were awarded Julius Rosenwald Fellowships for graduate work at Harvard University, but that university did not accept women. Murray was rejected despite a letter of support from President Roosevelt. She wrote in response, [...] "I would gladly change my sex to meet your requirements, but since the way to such change has not been revealed to me, I have no recourse but to <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to change your minds. Are you to tell me that one is as difficult as the other?" ...|$|E
2500|$|I make my <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> comrades. If {{we have to}} adjourn {{without a}} {{declaration}} I would a thousand times rather do that than commit the Socialist Party to an anarchistic, illegal, and communistic doctrine." [...] Following the conclusion of debate, the Declaration of Principles was approved by majority vote of the assembled delegates and the matter referred to {{the membership of the}} party for ratification by referendum vote.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 November Chan's pro-democratic {{supporters}} {{warned the}} public about the consequences of further pro-Beijing influences. [...] Former head of ICAC and Chan's adviser Lily Yam Kwan Pui-ying wrote, [...] "I am sending out this personal <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> because Hong Kong is in great danger of being dominated by one voice and one party under different guises, where everyone fears expressing his or her choice and preference. [...] This will happen sooner than we think unless we all act NOW." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want your}} answer to that, Lord Silverbridge. I have told you that I would have no {{skeleton}} in the cupboard. Down at Matching, and before that at Killancodlem, I <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> asking <b>you</b> <b>to</b> take me as your wife." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "Now I wish {{to speak}} to all men and women engaged in violence. I <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> in {{language}} of passionate pleading. On my knees I beg you {{to turn away from}} the paths of violence and to return to the ways of peace. You may claim to seek justice. I too believe in justice and seek justice. But violence only delays the day of justice. Violence destroys the work of justice. Further violence in Ireland will only drag down to ruin the land you claim to love and the values you claim to cherish." ...|$|E
2500|$|Patrick recounts {{that he had}} {{a vision}} a few years after {{returning}} home:I saw a man coming, as it were from Ireland. His name was Victoricus, and he carried many letters, and he gave me one of them. I read the heading: [...] "The Voice of the Irish". As I began the letter, I imagined in that moment that I heard the voice of those very people who were near the wood of Foclut, which is beside the western sea—and they cried out, as with one voice: [...] "We <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> holy servant boy, to come and walk among us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Irving {{nonetheless}} {{worked the}} secret material into his book, writing an entire chapter about Enigma {{in the first}} draft of The Mare's Nest. When it {{came to the attention of}} the authorities, [...] "one night I was visited at my flat by men in belted raincoats who came and physically seized the chapter. I was summoned to the Cabinet Office, twelve men sitting around a polished table, where it was explained to me why [...] was not being released and we <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> as an English gentleman not to release [...]" [...] Irving cooperated and withdrew the chapter, but by this time he had copied enough material from Cherwell's archive to furnish several more books. ULTRA remained secret for another decade.|$|E

6000|$|... "She is a woman," [...] Nancy said, {{with what}} seemed a touch of vehemence. [...] "It's useless <b>to</b> expect <b>you</b> <b>to</b> understand....

6000|$|... "Unless {{a walking}} tour in Normandy {{for a month}} <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> You see, I am {{going to take a}} holiday, and I have a fancy that our ideas on the subject of {{holidays}} might not exactly agree." ...|$|R
2500|$|The protest arose {{controversy}} in political circles. Tsyganko reported a private {{interview with the}} Romanian envoy Artur Văitoianu. He quoted the latter as offering a deal: [...] "You must renounce [...] if only for this sole reason—that you no good Roumanian officials in Bessarabia—that is to say, none who are good nationalists. If you give up autonomy, you {{will not have a}} Commissioner-General, but you will have a Bessarabian Chargé d'Affaires, a man of your own character, who will be nominated by the Central Power. The new [...] Directorate will remain in office until the meeting of the Pan-Roumanian Constitutional Assembly. Does this <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> as attractive?" [...] Also according to Tsyganko, Văitoianu informed the group that they needed to coalesce with Romanian nationalists in front of Great Russian revivalism, and that [...] "the national idea takes precedence over everything", implicitly threatening Sfatul dignitaries.|$|E
2500|$|At 11:00a.m. on 28 July, Austria {{declared}} war on Serbia. Following instructions from Bethmann Hollweg, von Tschirschky did not present Wilhelm’s [...] "Stop in Belgrade" [...] proposal until noon. At 1:00am on 29 July 1914 the first shots of the First World War were fired by the Austrian monitor SMS Bodrog, which bombarded Belgrade in response to Serbian sappers blowing up the railway bridge over the river Sava which linked the two countries. In Russia, partial mobilization was ordered for the four military districts bordering Austria-Hungary. Wilhelm sent a telegram to Nicholas asking for Russian support for the Austrian war against Serbia. Nicholas replied: [...] "Am glad you are back... I <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to help me. An ignoble war has been declared on a weak country... Soon I shall be overwhelmed by pressure brought upon me... to take extreme measures which will lead to war. To try and avoid such as a calamity as a European war, I beg you {{in the name of}} our old friendship to do what you can to stop your allies from going too far." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{fact that}} {{not one of the}} three people who have <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for the charge of the child is in a {{position}} to use the only real force which exists in this land. I mean the law," [...] Grooten continued.|$|R

"What would ye say, now," [...] {{the veteran}} continued, {{crossing}} one {{leg over the}} other and arguing the matter out in a confidential undertone-- [...] "what would you say if a young man came <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and, {{on the assumption that}} you were a dishonest blackgaird, <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> help him in a very shady sort of a scheme?
