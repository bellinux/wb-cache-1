40|$|International audienceBisphenol A {{diglycidyl ether}} (BADGE) is widely applied as a monomer for {{coatings}} and adhesives in use for food contact. Reports {{have been published}} indicating that, after migration from packagings into foodstuffs, BADGE undergoes various reactions with yet unidentified food components. In order to elucidate its fate, losses of BADGE were determined after incubation with different foodstuffs and food components. Hereby, food proteins were identified as the reaction partners of BADGE. Adduct formation was found with nucleophilic side chains of amino acids. In vitro, cysteine exhibited outstanding activity. The formerly reported occurrence of methylthio derivatives of BADGE in foodstuffs was proved to originate from the reaction of BADGE with methionine. The occurrence in foodstuffs allows the use of BADGE-methylthio derivatives as marker substances for protein reactions with BADGE. The obtained results offer a new {{point of view on}} the evaluation of BADGE migration. The hydrolysis and hydrochlorination derivatives subject to European legislation make up not more than a fraction of the totally migrated BADGE, while toxic or <b>allergenic</b> <b>potentials</b> of the protein adducts are yet unknown.

30|$|Charging of fungal spores and any {{potentially}} connected functions (e.g. {{in support}} for spores {{to serve as}} nuclei for raindrops; Elbert et al. 2007; Hassett et al. 2015) are understudied and generally little understood (Webster et al. 1988; Wargenau et al. 2011, 2013; Saar 2013; Saar and Parmasto 2014; Saar and Salm 2014). In line, practical use of charging of spores and spore behaviour in electric fields has so far only seldom been made of. However, guarding of bookshelves with an electric field screen has been tested to successfully protect old valuable books in library stack rooms against mold infection by airborne spores (Takikawa et al. 2014) and electrostatic dust collectors were applied in French archives to study their fungal <b>allergenic</b> <b>potentials</b> (Roussel et al. 2012). Spores in buildings and rooms distribute unevenly, among as factors behind by being influenced by electric and magnetic devices (Anaya et al. 2015, 2016). Knowledge on fungal spore distributions in buildings as in outside environments can come through application of electrostatic dust collectors (Normand et al. 2016) and electrostatic precipitators might be used (Han et al. 2011). An electrostatic nursery shelter and an ozone-generative electrostatic spore precipitator were reported to protect tomato plants in hydroponic culture and in open-window greenhouses against fungal pathogens (Shimizu et al. 2007; Kakutani et al. 2012; Takikawa et al. 2016) and an electrostatic spore collector {{has been applied to}} collect conidia of the barley pathogen Blumeria graminis (Moriura et al. 2006).

In the past, it has been shown that the choice of tomato cultivar significantly influenced the allergic reaction of tomato allergic subjects. In this study we investigated the <b>allergenic</b> <b>potential</b> of the cultivated tomato line M 82 and of two selected lines carrying small chromosome regions from the wild species Solanum pennellii (i. e. IL 7 - 3 and IL 12 - 4). We evaluated the positive interactions of IgEs of allergic subjects in order to investigate the different <b>allergenic</b> <b>potential</b> of the lines under investigation. We used proteomic analyses in order to identify putative tomato allergens. In addition, bioinformatic and transcriptomic approaches were applied in order to analyse the structure and the expression profiles of the identified allergen-encoding genes. These analyses demonstrated that fruits harvested from the two selected introgression lines harbour a different <b>allergenic</b> <b>potential</b> as those from the cultivated genotype M 82. The different allergenicity found within the three lines was mostly due to differences in the IgE recognition of a polygalacturonase enzyme (46 kDa), one of the major tomato allergens, and of a pectin methylesterase (34 kDa); both the proteins were more immunoreactive in IL 7 - 3 compared to IL 12 - 4 and M 82. The observed differences in the <b>allergenic</b> <b>potential</b> were mostly due to line-dependent translational control or post-translational modifications of the allergens.

In this review the impact of processing (heat and non-heat treatment) on the <b>allergenic</b> <b>potential</b> of proteins, and on the antigenic (IgG-binding) and allergenic (IgE-binding) properties of proteins has been considered. A variety of allergenic foods (peanuts, tree nuts, cows' milk, hens' eggs, soy, wheat and mustard) have been reviewed. The overall conclusion drawn is that processing does not completely abolish the <b>allergenic</b> <b>potential</b> of allergens. Currently, only fermentation and hydrolysis may have potential to reduce allergenicity {{to such an extent}} that symptoms will not be elicited, while other methods might be promising but need more data. Literature on the effect of processing on <b>allergenic</b> <b>potential</b> and the ability to induce sensitisation is scarce.

Methods: In a series of studies, we tested the safety of personal care products containing oatmeal (creams, cleansers, lotions) by assessing their irritant/allergenic potential on repeat insult patch testing, in safety-in-use and ocular studies using subjects with nonsensitive and sensitive skin. We also tested the skin moisturizing and repair properties of an oatmeal-containing skin care product for dry skin. Results: We found that oatmeal-containing personal care products had very low irritant potential as well as a very low <b>allergenic</b> sensitization <b>potential.</b> Low-level reactions were documented in 1. 0 % of subjects during the induction phase of repeat insult patch testing; one of 2291 subjects developed a persistent but doubtful low-level reaction involving edema during the challenge phase in repeat insult patch testing.
