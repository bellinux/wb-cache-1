25|$|Heavier {{aircraft}} are more stable and {{more resistant to}} yawing moments, and therefore have lower VMCAs. The longitudinal centre of gravity affects the VMCA as well: the further from the tail it is, the lower the minimum control speed, because the rudder {{will be able to}} provide a larger yawing moment, and so it is easier to counteract the imbalance in thrust. The lateral centre of gravity also has an effect: the nearer the inoperative engine it is, the larger the moment of the working engine, and so the more force the rudder has to apply. This means that if the lateral centre of gravity shifts towards the inoperative engine, the aircraft's VMCA will increase. The thrust of most engines depends on altitude and temperature; increasing altitude and higher temperatures decrease thrust. This means that if the air temperature is higher and the aircraft has a higher altitude, the force of the operative engine will be lower, the rudder will have to provide less counteractive force, and so the VMCA will be lower. The bank angle also influences the minimum control speed. A small bank <b>angle</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the inoperative engine is required for smallest possible sideslip and therefore lower VMCA. Finally, if the P-factor of the working engine increases, then its yawing moment increases, and the aircraft's VMCA increases as a result.|$|E
2500|$|The II Corps, on {{the left}} of the British line, {{occupied}} defensive positions along the Mons–Condé Canal, while I Corps was positioned almost at a right <b>angle</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the canal, along the Mons–Beaumont road (see map). [...] I Corps was deployed in this manner to protect the right flank of the BEF, in case the French were forced to retreat from their position at Charleroi. I Corps did not line the canal, which meant that it was little involved the battle and the German attack was faced mostly by II Corps. The dominant geographical feature of the battlefield, was a loop in the canal, jutting outwards from Mons towards the village of Nimy. This loop formed a small salient which was difficult to defend and formed the focus of the battle.|$|E

5000|$|He {{designed}} {{a system for}} an undercarriage that could cope with cross winds, in which the main wheels could be set to a steering <b>angle</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> straight ahead, so that an aircraft could be landed safely in a [...] "crabbing" [...] attitude. Tests with several aircraft types were conducted during and after World War II.|$|E
50|$|Taking the two {{equations}} for True VMG {{given the}} section above, calculating {{the rate of}} change in respect to the angle towards your destination is achieved by differential calculus. Simply taking the derivative of each equation will allow you to calculate the rate of VMG per <b>angle</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> your destination. This is another tool to help prove the concept of VMG.|$|E
5000|$|In {{navigation}} bearing may refer, {{depending on}} the context, to any of: (A) the direction or course of motion itself; (B) {{the direction of a}} distant object relative to the current course (or the [...] "change" [...] in course that would be needed to get to that distant object); or (C), the <b>angle</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> North of a distant point as observed at the current point.|$|E
5000|$|Palmyra's main {{streets were}} not at right angles, and this arch was famously built at a 30-degree turn in the {{colonnade}} between the tetrapylon (التترابيل) and the Temple of Bel (معبد بل‎), with two richly carved façades <b>angled</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> one another.|$|R
50|$|Cubitus valgus is {{a medical}} {{deformity}} in which the forearm is <b>angled</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the body {{to a greater degree}} than normal when fully extended. A small degree of cubitus valgus (known as the carrying angle) is acceptable and occurs in the general population.|$|R
50|$|The basic dome {{design has}} been {{modified}} extensively, producing tents with three poles, tents with irregularly-shaped bases, and other unusual types. A common variation {{is to add}} a third pole between two adjacent corners; this is <b>angled</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the tent and supports {{an extension of the}} flysheet, to give a porch/storage area.|$|R
50|$|Cowtail {{stingrays}} are solitary foragers {{that feed}} on bony fishes (including leiognathids, Nemipterus, and soles), crustaceans, polychaete worms, sipunculids, and molluscs. The cowtail stingray is in turn preyed upon by various species of hammerhead and requiem sharks, {{as well as}} by the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus). When threatened, they consistently flee at a 45° <b>angle</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the predator, a trajectory that allows them to maximize the distance covered while still keeping the predator within their field of vision.|$|E
50|$|Clay-kicking is a {{specialised}} method {{developed in}} the United Kingdom of digging tunnels in strong clay-based soil structures. Unlike previous manual methods of using mattocks which relied on the soil structure to be hard, clay-kicking was relatively silent and hence did not harm soft clay-based structures. The clay-kicker lies on a plank at a 45-degree <b>angle</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the working face and inserts a tool with a cup-like rounded end with the feet. Turning the tool manually, the kicker extracts a section of soil, which is then placed on the waste extract.|$|E
50|$|Each {{scale and}} bristle is {{produced}} intracellularly in a vesicle {{known as the}} silica deposition vesicle (SDV), which {{is connected to the}} chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum. Their production is also associated with the Golgi body, the nucleus, the chloroplast, and how the complex of these organelles is arranged in relation to the SDV within the cell. Formation of the scales and bristles occurs along the chloroplast’s outer surface because of SDV’s close placement to the CER. Directional placement could be parallel to cell length or at an <b>angle</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> either the posterior or anterior ends of the cell.|$|E
50|$|An épinette player usually plays sitting down. The épinette {{is placed}} on a table (most often), or on the lap <b>angling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the player. Unlike other forms of dulcimer, the épinette gives some {{separation}} between the melody strings and the drones. Thus, those areas can be struck separately to establish rhythm.|$|R
50|$|A typical Newton's cradle {{consists}} {{of a series of}} identically sized metal balls suspended in a metal frame so that they are just touching each other at rest. Each ball is attached to the frame by two wires of equal length <b>angled</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> each other. This restricts the pendulums' movements to the same plane.|$|R
50|$|Burnhamthorpe Road {{is a major}} {{arterial}} road in the cities of Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario; beginning at Dundas Street (from which it initially <b>angles</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> before running parallel with), near Islington Avenue, running west and becoming a rural road in the Town of Oakville, where it terminates (after breaking) at Tremaine Road, where it changes name.|$|R
50|$|While most damselflies {{rest with}} their wings folded together, {{most members of}} the family Lestidae hold them at an <b>angle</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> their bodies. The pterostigma (a single dark spot in the {{meshwork}} of the leading edge near the tip of each wing) is noticeably elongated. The quadrilateral (a part of the wing venation, close to the body) has an acute angle at the end. The body has a greenish, metallic shine. The superior anal appendages, commonly called claspers (body parts of male insect for clasping the female during copulation) of male spreadwings are long and strongly curved.|$|E
50|$|Tropical convolvulaceous flowers show a {{preferred}} orientation, pointing {{in the general}} direction of the sun but not exactly tracking the sun. They demonstrated no diurnal heliotropism but strong seasonal heliotropism. If solar tracking is exact, the sun’s rays would always enter the corolla tube and warm the gynoecium, a process which could be dangerous in a tropical climate. However, by adopting a certain <b>angle</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the solar angle, this is prevented. The trumpet shape of these flowers thus acts as a parasol shading the gynoecium at times of maximum solar radiation, and not allowing the rays to impinge on the gynoecium.|$|E
50|$|All {{muzzle brake}} designs share a basic principle: they {{partially}} divert combustion gases at a generally sideways <b>angle,</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the muzzle {{end of the}} bore. The momentum of the diverted gases thus does not add to the recoil. The angle toward which the gases are directed will fundamentally affect how the brake behaves. If gases are directed upward, they will exert a downward force and counteract muzzle rise. Any device that {{is attached to the}} end of the muzzle will also add mass, increasing its inertia and moving its center of mass forward; the former will reduce recoil and the latter will reduce muzzle rise.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} Crooks, Crux, Pointer Grind, or the K-grind {{after the man}} to whom the trick is most {{commonly}} accredited, Eric Koston. It is like a nosegrind, but {{the tail of the}} board is <b>angled</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the rail/ledge on which the trick is performed, causing the edge of the deck's nose to also rub. Invented by Eric Koston.|$|R

50|$|Also the {{mechanical}} {{design of a}} glass-to-metal seal has an important influence on {{the reliability of the}} seal. In practical glass-to-metal seals cracks usually start {{at the edge of the}} interface between glass and metal either inside or outside the glass container. If the metal and the surrounding glass are symmetric the crack propagates in an <b>angle</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the axis. So, if the glass envelope of the metal wire extends far enough from the wall of the container the crack will not go through the wall of the container but it will reach the surface on the same side where it started and the seal will not leak despite the crack.|$|E
5000|$|Limitations of {{the tractor}} concept include the exhaust configuration. With the most {{efficient}} hovering design (that is, pointing the exhaust directly at the target object for maximum force per unit of fuel), the expelled reaction mass hits the target head-on, imparting a force in exactly the opposite direction to the gravitational pull of the tractor. It would therefore be necessary to use the orbiting-tractor scheme described below, or else design the hovering tractor so that its exhaust is directed at a slight <b>angle</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the object, while still pointing [...] "down" [...] enough to keep a steady hover. This requires greater thrust and correspondingly increased fuel consumption for each m/s change in the target's velocity.|$|E
50|$|A further {{design of}} {{tailplane}} is the V-tail, {{so named because}} that instead of the standard inverted T or T-tail, there are two vertical fins <b>angled</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{each other in a}} V (if they're arranged like a V, {{at least one of them}} isn't vertical). To produce yaw like a rudder, the two trailing edge control surfaces move in the same direction. To produce pitch like an elevator, the surfaces move in opposite directions.|$|R
50|$|The detail {{illustration}} {{shows that}} when the handle is <b>angled</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the ball both the position of contact with {{the ball on the}} ball and the part of the face of the stick making contact will be altered.

5000|$|The kata {{focuses on}} the stance [...] "shiko-dachi" [...] (sometimes {{referred}} to as [...] "seiunchin-dachi"), a low horse stance at which the knees are bent at obtuse angles and the feet are <b>angled</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the direction the body is facing at forty-five degree angles. The kata is broken into segments, each utilizing a specific breathing and muscle-tensing method. The kata has no obvious kicks, but one section contains hints of a rising knee strike.|$|R
5000|$|Water is {{typically}} {{drawn from the}} pool via a rectangular aperture in the wall, connected through to a device fitted into one (or more) wall/s of the pool. The internals of the skimmer are accessed from the pool deck through a circular or rectangle lid, about one foot in diameter. If the pool's water pump is operational water is drawn from the pool over a floating hinged weir (operating from a vertical position to 90 degrees <b>angle</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the pool, {{in order to stop}} leaves and debris being back-flooded into the pool by wave action), and down into a removable [...] "skimmer basket", the purpose of which is to entrap leaves, dead insects and other larger floating debris.|$|E
5000|$|The US Army {{defines the}} bearing from Point A to Point B as the angle between a ray in the {{direction}} of north or south, whose origin is Point A, and Ray AB, the ray whose origin is Point A and which contains Point B. The bearing consists of 2 characters and 1 number: first, the character is either N or S. Next is the angle value. Third, the character representing the direction of the <b>angle</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the reference ray - thus, either E, or W. The angle value will always be less than 90 degrees. [...] For example, if Point B is located exactly southeast of Point A, the bearing from Point A to Point B is S 45° E.|$|E

25|$|Part of {{the market}} sits on what was {{originally}} mudflats below the bluffs west of Pike Place. In the late 19th century, West Street (now Western Avenue, <b>angling</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Pike Place) was already a through street running more or less parallel to the shore. Railroad Avenue (now Alaskan Way) was built farther out on pilings; it was not filled in until the 1930s.

50|$|A ramp slide is an {{evacuation}} slide {{that has a}} small platform between the exit and the slide itself, and is used mainly where {{the proximity of the}} exit to an engine requires the slide to be <b>angled</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the engine to prevent damage. Airbus A310, Airbus 340-600, Airbus A380 and Boeing 747 aircraft have ramp slide attachments for their overwing evacuation slides.
