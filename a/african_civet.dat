Side-striped jackal are common and often spotted in the early mornings. A range of smaller carnivores occur, of which water mongoose, white-tailed mongoose, <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> and large spotted genet are commonly encountered at night and slender, banded and dwarf mongoose can often be seen crossing pathways during the day. Caracal, serval, honey badger and the rare Meller's mongoose occur but are very seldom sighted. Two species of otter live in Kasanka’s rivers, marshes and lakes.|$|E

50|$|The <b>African</b> palm <b>civet</b> is {{omnivorous}} and pineapples {{and other}} fruits {{make up the}} majority of its diet. This is supplemented with rodents, lizards, birds and frogs, as well as invertebrates. <b>African</b> palm <b>civets</b> feed by holding their prey in their hand-like front paws, biting it repeatedly and then once dead then swallowing it whole.|$|R
50|$|A 2006 phylogenetic {{study showed}} that the <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> {{is closely related to}} the genus Viverra. It was {{estimated}} that the Civettictis-Viverra clade diverged from Viverricula around 16.2 Mya; the <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> split from Viverra 12.3 Mya. The authors suggested that the subfamily Viverrinae should be bifurcated into Genettinae (Poiana and Genetta) and Viverrinae (Civettictis, Viverra and Viverricula). The following cladogram is based on this study.|$|E

5000|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> is Civettictis civetta. It is the sole member of its genus, {{and a member of}} the family Viverridae. The <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1776 as Viverra civetta. In 1915, the English zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock placed the <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> in its own genus, Civettictis. A 1969 study noted that this civet showed enough differences from the rest of the viverrines in terms of dentition to be classified under its own genus. The generic name Civettictis is a fusion of the French civette and the Greek ictis, meaning [...] "weasel". The specific name civetta and the common name [...] "civet" [...] come from the French civette or the Arabic zabād or sinnawr al-zabād ("civet cat"). The civet has been a valued domestic animal in Africa since ancient times.|$|E

50|$|Like many mammals, the <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> has {{two types}} of fur - under fur and guard hairs. The pelage of the <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> is coarse and wiry. The coat is unique to each individual, just like a human fingerprint. The dorsal base color of the fur varies from white to creamy yellow to reddish. The stripes, spots, and blotches which cover the animal are deep brown to black in coloration. Horizontal lines are {{prominent}} on the hind limbs, spots are normally present on the midsection of the animal and fade anteriorly into vertical stripes above the forelimbs. The tail of the <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> is black with a few white bands and the paws are completely black. The head, neck and ears are clearly marked. A black band stretches across its eyes {{like that of a}} raccoon and the coloration of its neck is referred to as a double collar because of the two black neck bands.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife in {{the forest}} include Monkey species (including {{recently}} re-introduced Colobus Monkeys), bush baby, bushbuck, bush pig, porcupine, duiker, genet, dik dik, <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> and East African epauletted fruit bat.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> ( [...] ; Civettictis civetta) is {{the largest}} {{representative}} of the African Viverridae and the sole member of its genus.It is considered common and widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
50|$|The endearing golden-rumped {{elephant}} shrew, an endemic elephant shrew {{the size}} of a rabbit, is the most noticeable of the park's endemic mammals; the Sokoke bushy-tailed mongoose and Aders' duiker (found only here and in Zanzibar) are more elusive. The forest also has savannah elephants, <b>African</b> <b>civets,</b> as well as sokokes, baboons and vervet monkeys. The park is also recognised as an outstanding centre of amphibian diversity.|$|R
50|$|Females are polyestrous and {{can have}} up to three litters per year. Female <b>African</b> <b>civets</b> {{normally}} give birth to one to four young. The young are born in advanced stages compared to most carnivores. They are covered in a dark, short fur and can crawl at birth. The young leave the nest after eighteen days but are still dependent on the mother for milk and protection for another two months.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} species of civet, Civettictis civetta of Ethiopia, and Viverra zibetha and Viverricula indica of India, Malaya, Indochina, and Indonesia, can yield civet oil. Most civet is however {{produced}} by civet farms in Africa, where the secreted oil is taken from the pouches of caged animals once a week. <b>African</b> <b>civets</b> typically produce three to four grams of civet each week. In 2000, civet sold for about five hundred dollars per kilogram.|$|R
50|$|The Viverrinae {{range in}} size from the African linsang with a body length of 33 cm and a weight of 650 g to the <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> at 84 cm and 18 kg.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> has an {{omnivorous}} {{diet that}} includes insects (Orthoptera, Coleoptera and Isoptera), fruit (Ficus species), small mammals (Muridae), birds, reptiles (Agama spp and Striped skink), frogs, fish, crabs, carrion and eggs.|$|E
50|$|Examples {{of species}} listed on Appendix III and the {{countries}} that listed them are the two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni) by Costa Rica, <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> (Civettictis civetta) by Botswana, and the alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) by the USA.|$|E

50|$|The potto has {{relatively}} few predators, because large mammalian carnivores cannot {{climb to the}} treetops where they live, and the birds of prey {{in this part of}} Africa are diurnal. One population of chimpanzees living in Mont Assirik, Senegal, was observed to eat pottos, taking them from their sleeping places during the day; however, this behaviour has not been observed in chimps elsewhere. Pottos living near villages face some predation from humans, who hunt them as bushmeat. They are sometimes preyed upon by <b>African</b> palm <b>civets,</b> although <b>African</b> palm <b>civets</b> are largely frugivorous.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> is an {{omnivorous}} generalist, taking small vertebrates, invertebrates, eggs, carrion, {{and vegetable}} matter. It {{is capable of}} taking on poisonous invertebrates and snakes. Prey is primarily detected by smell and sound rather than by sight. It prefers riverine habitats and woodlands.|$|E
5000|$|Although more {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "musk", the term itself is often used to describe a wide variety of [...] "musky" [...] substances from other animals such as the <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> ("civet musk") or various synthetic musks whose compound exhibits some character of deer musk.|$|E
50|$|This {{subfamily}} {{is found}} throughout the Oriental region, and is represented in Africa by the <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> (Civettictis civetta). The common genet (Genetta genetta) is considered to have been introduced to Europe and the Balearic islands, and occurs in all of continental Portugal, Spain and most of France.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> palm <b>civet</b> ranges {{throughout}} much of sub-Saharan Africa and occurs from day its range extends from South Sudan to Guinea, south to Angola and into eastern Zimbabwe.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> palm <b>civet</b> is a crepuscular, solitary animal which emerges for a {{few hours}} around dawn and dusk to hunt for food. They are mainly {{arboreal}} animals. spending the majority of the daylight and night-time hours sheltering in trees. Despite their otherwise solitary natures, <b>African</b> palm <b>civets</b> have been known to congregate in groups of as many as 15 animals if food is abundant. They have two sets of scent glands on the lower abdomen and between the third and fourth toes on each foot,which secrete a strong smelling substance which is used to mark territory and in mating.|$|R
50|$|The perineal gland is {{what this}} species of civet {{is well known for}} and Civettictis civetta has {{historically}} been the species most often harvested for it. This gland secretes a white or yellow waxy substance called civet, which is used by civets for marking territory and by humans as a perfume base. Perineal and anal glands are found in both male and female <b>African</b> <b>civets,</b> however, the glands are bigger in males, which can produce a stronger secretion. The perineal glands are located between the scrotum and the prepuce in males and between the anus and the vulva in females.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> {{has five}} digits per manus {{in which the}} first toe is {{slightly}} set back from the others. The <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> has long, curved, semi-retractile claws. Its feet are compact and unsuitable for digging or climbing and the soles of the feet are hairless.African Civets have a modified synapsid skull which is heavy-built and is the longest of any viverrid. The zygomatic arch is robust and provides a large area for attachment of the masseter muscle. The skull also has a well-developed sagittal crest which provides a large area for attachment of the temporalis muscle. This musculature and the African civet’s strong mandible give it a powerful bite oriented to its omnivorous diet. African civets have a total of forty teeth and a dental formula of 3/3, 1/1, 4/4, 2/2.|$|E
50|$|The average {{lifespan}} of an <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> is {{fifteen to}} twenty years. Mating {{occurs in the}} warm and wet summer months from August to January. This time is favored {{because of the large}} populations of insects. Females create a nest which is normally in dense vegetation and commonly in a hole dug by another animal.|$|E
50|$|Glandular {{substances}} with musk-like odors {{are also}} {{obtained from the}} musk duck (Biziura lobata) of southern Australia, the muskox, the musk shrew, the musk beetle (Aromia moschata), the <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> (Civettictis civetta), the musk turtle (Sternotherus odoratus), the American alligator of North America, lynx musk, lungurion which, in antiquity, was highly valued, and from several other animals.|$|E
50|$|There are a three primate species: vervet monkeys, red colobus {{monkeys and}} patas monkeys. Other mammals include antelope, squirrel, porcupine, <b>African</b> palm <b>civets,</b> mongooses, galagos, and {{several types of}} rodents, {{including}} cane rats.|$|R
50|$|The {{common name}} {{is used for}} a variety of {{carnivorous}} mammalian species, mostly of the family Viverridae. The <b>African</b> palm <b>civet</b> (Nandinia binotata) is genetically distinct and belongs in its own monotypic family, Nandiniidae.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> palm <b>civet</b> (Nandinia binotata) {{resembles the}} civets of the Viverridae, but is genetically {{distinct}} and belongs {{in its own}} monotypic family, the Nandiniidae. There is little dispute that the Poiana species are viverrids.|$|R
