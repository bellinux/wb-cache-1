40|$|In the article, the {{development}} problems of environmental insurance as a risk management method for maintaining environmental {{safety in the}} region are considered. The detailed analysis of the laws of the Russian Federation in conservation activity is presented; contradictions and shortcomings arerevealed. Ways of overcoming of theexisting formalcharacter of maintaining environmental safety in the Russian regions are offered. In particular, extension of insurance covering in the current law «On compulsory insurance of the civil liability of an owner of dangerous installation on the infliction of harm as a result of accident on dangerous installation» at the expense of inclusion in number of insurance risks of risk of environmental harm. The special attention in the article is paid to insurance of public liability of owners of chemical objects as the most dangerous to the environment. The methodology of <b>actuarial</b> <b>expectation</b> is added with a risk assessment of expert services {{with the use of a}} scoring method allowing evaluating real danger to the population and the environment by the chemicals, which are especially acting in small doses. Furthermore, the added calculation methodology of insurance tariffs allows using preventive function of insurance, not so popular in Russian practices. That gives a new source of financing of nature-conservative measures in the regio...|$|E
40|$|System {{dynamics}} (SD) may amplify asset {{and liability}} management (ALM) methodology capability to be risk oriented. Therefore, this paper aims to apply SD principles to ALM models, {{in the specific}} case of pension funds. Conceptual issues assigned to ALM variables are described and a dynamic ALM approach, based on SD general principles and risk factors, is then examined. Risk must be defined in tangible operational terms. Pension funds need to produce a high-income return to correspond to <b>actuarial</b> <b>expectations</b> and to pay different kind of benefits. Its underlying assets non-financial nature and long-term liabilities dictate the nature of risk management. In a changing and complex environment, pension funds wealth management need a more robust investment allocation approach, than the static mean-variance analysis. In this context, ALM may provide some advantages. Finally, since decisions under uncertainty become complex specially because of the low comprehension of system long term best interests as a whole, system dynamics methods may provide an holistic overview to the ALM analysis results. The combination may improve the managers ability to explicit tacit knowledge, understand complexity and design better operating policies enhancing, this way, the discussions and learning about businesses strategies. Key words: system dynamics; asset/liability management(ALM); ALM risk management; social security; risk factors models; pension fund...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{the ability}} of managed care {{organizations}} to balance high quality pharmaceutical care with improved cost-efficien-cy has become increasingly more challenging due {{to a variety of}} economic, sociologic and political pressures. More and more, the onus is being placed upon pharmacy administra-tors to find newer and more innovative ways to maintain opti-mal levels of quality and access in drug benefit programs, {{while at the same time}} still managing drug cost trends to often under-budgeted <b>actuarial</b> <b>expectations.</b> Interventions that are relatively simple to employ, well-accepted by providers and patients and yield cost savings, are an infrequent, but highly welcomed and valued discovery. Well-designed programs tar-geting improved efficiency in dosing of key maintenance medications can prove such a prospect. With the advent of greater numbers of once-daily admin-istered medications, an intervention strategy entitled “dosage optimization ” or “dosage consolidation ” may provide the opportunity for significant drug cost savings. Dose optimiza-tion refers to prospective identification of patients who receive multiple units (tablets or capsules) of a lower strength, once-daily maintenance medication and taking action to consolidate (or “optimize”) the regimen to an equivalent daily dosage of the same medication given as a single unit once daily. This particular intervention focuses primarily upon once-a-day (QD) maintenance medications that are available in multiple dosage strengths, with parity (or near parity) pric-ing among the various dose forms. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, lisinopril is an example of a medication targeted for this type of intervention. This medication is available in several dosage strengths (5, 10, 20, 40 mg), with very small differences in the average wholesale price (AWP) among these various dosage forms. With a dose optimization intervention program, OBJECTIVE: To employ a carefully struc-tured dose optimization program within a large integrated healthcare system to maximize potential drug cost savings...|$|R
