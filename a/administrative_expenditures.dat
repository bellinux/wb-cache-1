5000|$|Further {{land reform}} {{occurred}} after the 1968 coup by left-wing colonel Juan Velasco Alvarado. The military dictatorship under General Juan Velasco Alvarado (1968-75) launched {{a large scale}} agrarian reform movement that attempted to redistribute land, hoping to break Peru's traditionally inequitable pattern of land holding and the hold of traditional oligarchy. [...] The model used by Velasco {{to bring about change}} was the associative enterprise, in which former salaried rural workers and independent peasant families would become members of different kinds of cooperatives. About 22 million acres were redistributed, more land than in any reform program outside of Cuba. Unfortunately, productivity suffered as peasants with no management experience took control. The military government continued to spend huge amounts of money to transform Peru's agriculture to socialized ownership and management. These state expenditures are to blame for the enormous increase in Peru's external debt {{at the beginning of the}} 1970s. [...] State bankruptcy was partly caused by the cheap credit the government extended to promote agrarian development, state subsidies, and <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures</b> to carry out the agrarian reform during this period.

This study used difference-in-differences (DID) models to estimate differences in health care expenditure trends {{before and after the}} introduction of a financial agreement between 9 intervention countries and 16 control countries. Intervention countries included countries with pay-for-coordination (PFC), pay-for-performance (PFP), and/or all inclusive agreements (bundled and global payment) for integrated chronic care. OECD and WHO data from 1996 to 2013 was used. The results from the main DID models showed that the annual growth of outpatient expenditure was decreased in countries with PFC (by 21. 28 US$ per capita) and in countries with all-inclusive agreements (by 216. 60 US$ per capita). The growth of hospital and <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditure</b> was decreased in countries with PFP by 64. 50 US$ per capita and 5. 74 US$ per capita, respectively. When modelling impact as a non-linear function of time during the total 4 -year period after implementation, PFP decreased the growth of hospital and <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditure</b> and all-inclusive agreements reduced the growth of outpatient expenditure. Financial agreements are potentially powerful tools to stimulate integrated care and influence health care expenditure growth. A blended payment scheme that combines elements of PFC, PFP, and all-inclusive payments is likely to provide the strongest financial incentives to control health care expenditure growth...|$|R

We investigated trends in <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditure</b> across OECD countries, cross-country spending differences, spending differences between health care system typologies, and differences in the scale and scope of administrative functions across typologies. We used OECD data, which include health system governance and financing-related administrative activities by regulators, governance bodies, and insurers (macrolevel), but exclude <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditure</b> by health care providers (mesolevel and microlevel). We find that governance and financing-related administrative spending at the macrolevel has remained stable {{over the last decade}} at slightly over 3 % of total health spending. Cross-country differences range from 1. 3 % of health spending in Iceland to 8. 3 % in the United States. Voluntary private health insurance bears much higher administrative costs than compulsory schemes in all countries. Among compulsory schemes, multiple payers exhibit significantly higher administrative spending than single payers. Among single-payer schemes, those where entitlements are based on residency have significantly lower administrative spending than those with single social health insurance, albeit with a small difference. These differences can partially be explained because multi-payer and voluntary private health insurance schemes require additional administrative functions and enjoy less economies of scale. Studies in hospitals and primary care indicate similar differences in administrative costs across health system typologies at the mesolevel and microlevel of health care delivery, which warrants more research on total administrative costs at all the levels of health system...|$|R

This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} NHIS in terms of health financing sub-functions of revenue collection, risks pooling, and purchasing of health care using the Ashiedu Keteke District NHIS Office as a case study. The review and participant observation methods were employed to analyze secondary data of the NHIS. Reviews were conducted on NHIS operational documents, annual reports, and published literature. A data compilation sheet was used to collect membership, revenue and expenditure data from the AshieduKeteke District NHIS Office. Out of 158, 466 members who registered over the period under study (2005 - 2012), about 30 % were active card-bearing members. The population coverage increased consistently from 6. 4 % to 29. 9 % over the study period. Children below eighteen years of age were the most registered members (42. 2 %). Membership is legally mandatory and household-based. The NHIS is largely tax-funded: prepaid contributions declined from 20 % to 15. 4 % over the study period. There was multiple fund system between 2005 and 2009; however, in 2011, a single risk pool (single fund system) was implemented to maximize risk pooling and administrative efficiency.

It is worth to remark the occurrence of networks concerning the application of Standard Cost Model (SCM), aimed to reduce <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures</b> for affairs.

We find similar initiatives in OECD, several European states, i. e. United Kingdom, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, {{as well as other}} countries. An international project "Cross Country Benchmarking" is important in this respect. These concerns have developed and diversified due to the worsening of the economic crisis. The crisis effects, already visible in the public sector too, lessen more and more the possibilities of satisfying the citizen's needs. The marketing specialists bring up more and more frequently new marketing instruments that, giving the context, should generate products and services meant to satisfy the citizens' needs.

The latest trustees ’ report indicates Medicare’s <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures</b> are 1 percent of total Medicare spending, while the latest NHEA indicates the figure is 6 percent. The debate about Medicare’s <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures,</b> which emerged several years ago, reflects widespread confusion about these data. Critics of Medicare argue that the official reports on Medicare’s overhead ignore or hide numerous types of administrative spending, such as the cost of collect-ing taxes and Part B premiums. Defenders of Medicare claim the official statistics are accurate. But participants {{on both sides of this}} debate fail to cite the official docu-ments and do not analyze CMS’s methodology. This article examines controversy over the methodology CMS uses to calculate the trustees ’ and NHEA’s measures and the sources of confusion and ignorance about them. It concludes with a discussion of how the two measures should be used. A virulent debate has erupted in recent years about the level of Medi-care’s administrative costs. Both sides of the political spectrum have used figures and data sources that have completely muddled several important issues, including whether allowing insurance companies to participate in Medicare can cut Medicare’s costs, whether converting Medicare into a voucher or “premium support ” plan would reduce Medicare’s costs, whether a “Medicare- like public option ” for the nonelderly can cut the national health care bill, and whether extending Medicare to the non-elderly would reduce the nation’s health care bill.

This study uses Japanese municipal-level data and argues for a relation between the choice of public administration distribution method and expenditure after amalgamation.
