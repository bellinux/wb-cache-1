5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E
5|$|The story's {{main part}} {{takes place in}} {{what seems to be}} a normal high school, but in fact all took place in the school term {{previous}} to Little Busters!, and Riki and Rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by the other members of the Little Busters. They, and the other main characters, were involved in a bus accident during a field trip, and only the two of them will survive. Kyousuke and the others created the artificial world to make them strong enough to deal with what will happen when they awaken in the real world. This was caused by <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> effect based on all of their desires to save Riki and Rin. The world loops, but though they forget what happens, Riki and Rin do grow stronger, and Kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave the world. They do manage to survive and get away from the crash site before Riki collapses because he has narcolepsy. Riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition, which was the reason why he was only able to save Rin and merely get away from the explosion before collapsing.|$|E
25|$|The {{improved}} conductivity {{of the new}} electrolyte can be seen {{by comparing}} two capacitors, both of which have a nominal capacitance of 1000µF at 16V rated voltage, in a package with a diameter of 10mm and a height of 20mm. The capacitors of the Rubycon YXG series are provided with an electrolyte based on an organic solvent and can attain an impedance of 46mΩ when loaded with <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> current of 1400mA. ZL series capacitors with the new water-based electrolyte can attain an impedance of 23mΩ with <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> current of 1820mA, an overall improvement of 30%.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>ripple</b> {{current is}} the RMS {{value of a}} {{superimposed}} AC current of any frequency and any waveform of the current curve for continuous operation. It arises, for example, in power supplies (including switched-mode power supplies) after rectifying an AC voltage and flows as biased charge and discharge current through the decoupling or smoothing capacitor.|$|E
25|$|ESR {{depends on}} {{temperature}} and frequency. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte the ESR generally decreases {{with increasing frequency}} and temperature. ESR influences the remaining superimposed AC ripple behind smoothing and may influence circuit functionality. Related to the capacitor, ESR is accountable for internal heat generation if <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> current flows over the capacitor. This internal heat reduces capacitor lifetime.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the non-Euclidean geometries had <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> effect which went far {{beyond the boundaries of}} mathematics and science. The philosopher Immanuel Kant's treatment of human knowledge had a special role for geometry. It was his prime example of synthetic a priori knowledge; not derived from the senses nor deduced through logic— our knowledge of space was a truth that we were born with. Unfortunately for Kant, his concept of this unalterably true geometry was Euclidean. Theology was also affected by the change from absolute truth to relative truth in the way that mathematics is related to the world around it, that was a result of this paradigm shift.|$|E
25|$|Gravitational {{waves are}} {{constantly}} passing Earth; however, even the strongest have a minuscule effect and their sources are generally {{at a great}} distance. For example, the waves given off by the cataclysmic final merger of GW150914 reached Earth after travelling over a billion light-years, as <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> in spacetime that changed {{the length of a}} 4-km LIGO arm by a ten thousandth of the width of a proton, proportionally equivalent to changing the distance to the nearest star outside the Solar System by one hair's width. This tiny effect from even extreme gravitational waves makes them only detectable on Earth by the most sophisticated detectors.|$|E

In 2004, United Airlines and American Airlines agreed to modify their flight schedules to help reduce congestion caused by clustered arrivals and departures. Because of the air traffic departing, arriving, and near the airport, air traffic controllers at O'Hare and its nearby facilities are among the leaders in {{the world in terms of}} number of controlled flights handled per hour.|$|E

25|$|The Penn Central's {{bankruptcy}} had <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> {{effect on}} the Northeast economy. The PC bankruptcy absolved them from paying their debts, which included payments owed to other railroads. The PC's failure to pay was a major contribution to other Northeast lines that also entered bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy was the final blow to long-haul private-sector passenger train service in the United States. The troubled company filed proposals with the ICC to abandon most of its remaining passenger rail service, causing a chain reaction among its fellow railroads, who also decided to drop their money losing passenger trains. In 1971 Congress created Amtrak, a government corporation, which began to operate a skeleton passenger service on the tracks of Penn Central and other U.S. railroads.|$|E
25|$|The large {{sub-floor}} {{is divided}} into four main rooms, accessed mainly off the rear promenade. Each of these spaces has <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> iron ceiling which follows {{the slope of the}} seating tiers above, a concrete floor a step or two below street level and windows and doors opening both to the promenade and {{to the front of the}} stand overlooking the arena. The northern room is utilised by the St John's Ambulance Service and has been divided by sheeted partitions into cubicles. Facilities include an early iron-framed, wheeled ambulance stretcher. The southern room has been converted into an English-style pub, complete with appropriately decorated entry. There are toilets located at each end of the subfloor, accessed from the front – the men's toilet at the southern end and the women's at the northern end. The men's toilet retains an early lead-light fanlight above the entrance door, but both facilities have been remodelled internally.|$|E
25|$|Originally, every {{electronic}} component had wire leads, and the PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The components' leads were then {{passed through the}} holes and soldered to the PCB trace. This method of assembly is called through-hole construction. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 {{was assigned to the}} U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over <b>a</b> <b>ripple,</b> or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are wasteful since drilling holes is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off.|$|E

25|$|Historical {{records show}} that this beetle once lived in 35 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, and three Canadian provinces: Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. Now, natural populations are known to occur in only five states {{and at least one}} province: on Block Island in Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Arkansas, South Dakota, Nebraska and Ontario. They have also been reintroduced to Ohio. In Oklahoma, {{petitions}} were made in 2015 and 2016 to delist the species from endangered status as it came {{in the way of the}} oil and gas industry in the region. N. americanus was listed as an endangered species in 1989; the IUCN lists the species as critically endangered. Biologists have determined conclusively why N. americanus has disappeared from so many areas. Widespread use of pesticides may have caused local populations to disappear. The dramatic disappearance of this insect from many areas, however, took place before widespread use of DDT. Lack of small carcasses to bury would prevent the species from reproducing, and changes in land use has reduced the quantity of small- to medium-sized birds and mammals preferred by N. americanus. Even the extinction of the once ubiquitous passenger pigeon may have had <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> effect on carrion feeders like this beetle.|$|E
