5000|$|Indonesia: The Yaris was {{launched}} in Indonesia in 2006. It is powered by the 1.5-litre 1NZ-FE engine matched to 4-speed super ECT automatic or 5-speed Manual transmission. Initially, the Yaris was offered in E, <b>S,</b> and <b>S</b> <b>Limited</b> trim levels. The automatic only <b>S</b> and <b>S</b> <b>Limited</b> came with front, side and rear spoilers. Engine Start/Stop button is for the <b>S</b> <b>Limited</b> only. The Yaris received minor changes for 2009 model year with new bumpers, grille, tail lights, and revised interior. The new base model J was added into the line up. The mid-level E got aero-style mudguards and roof spoiler, while full body kits are remained on the <b>S</b> and <b>S</b> <b>Limited.</b> The <b>S</b> <b>Limited</b> TRD Sportivo with extreme body kits and lowered springs was offered in small numbers. The Yaris received a facelift again in 2012 with the Vitz RS look but with different bumper, bodykit and spoiler, new steering wheel on E, S, and TRD Sportivo type (similar with the 2010 Grand New Corolla Altis Type V), and new interior with red stitching on S and TRD Sportivo types. The <b>S</b> <b>Limited</b> type was renamed to S A/T and the TRD Sportivo variant added manual transmission (previously available in automatic transmission only), a new aggressive body kit, and no longer used TRD suspension to reduce cost. Sales terminated in October 2013 when production in Thailand {{was replaced by the}} newer model. <b>S</b> <b>Limited</b> only. In other uses, Toyota Team Indonesia built a slightly modified Yaris based on the TRD sportivo model and is used for races in the Indonesian Touring Car Championship.|$|R

Lewis and Co, London, p. 72] and for which he gave no rigorous proof-says that, in simple weighted voting games, {{if the number of}} voters increases indefinitely and the relative quota is pegged, then-under certain conditions-the ratio between the voting powers of any two voters converges to the ratio between their weights.

40|$|Purpose To {{establish}} the criterion {{validity of the}} activPAL activity monitor in measuring sedentary behaviour (sitting/lying) and physical activity (standing/walking) in people with Parkinson’s Disease, using direct observation as the criterion measure. Design A cross-sectional observational study, evaluating the criterion validity of the activPAL in a laboratory setting. Participants 12 individuals with a Parkinson’s Disease diagnosis and Hoehn and Yahr Disease Severity Classification of ≤ 3 who could walk five minutes independently or with an aid. Methods Participants wore one activPAL monitor and completed a test protocol involving 3 modules: body-postures, {{activities of daily living}} and indoor/outdoor walking. Each trial was video-recorded where the camera was synchronised with the activPAL. Researchers classified the time spent in different postures and compared it to the activPAL output. Results Using the Bland and Altman method, the activPAL appeared to over-estimate sedentary behaviour compared to direct observation. Mean difference for module 1 was - 35. 6 <b>s</b> (<b>limits</b> of agreement - 75. 3 s to 4. 1 s) and for module 2 - 16. 5 <b>s</b> (<b>limits</b> of agreement - 29. 4 s to - 3. 6 s). When measuring physical activity, in module 1, the activPAL slightly underestimated compared to direct observation. Mean difference of 2. 3 <b>s</b> (<b>limits</b> of agreement - 21. 1 to 25. 7 s). Modules 2 and 3 had better agreement. Mean differences of - 0. 2 s and - 0. 1 <b>s</b> with <b>limits</b> of agreement of - 16. 9 s to 16. 5 s and - 1. 2 s to 1. 01 s, respectively.

40|$|In this paper, {{asymptotic}} multiple-scale {{methods are}} used to formulate a mathematically consistent set of thermo-acoustic equations in the low-Mach number limit for linear stability analysis. The resulting sets of nonlinear equations for hydrodynamics and acoustics are two-way coupled. The coupling strength depends on which multiple scales are used. The double-time-double-space (2 T- 2 S), double-time-single-space (2 T- 1 S) and single-time-double-space (1 T- 2 <b>S)</b> <b>limits</b> are revisited, derived and linearized. It is shown that only the 1 T- 2 <b>S</b> <b>limit</b> produces a two-way coupled linearized system. Therefore this limit is adopted and implemented in a finite-element solver. The methodology is applied to a coaxial jet combustor. By using an adjoint method and introducing the intrinsic sensitivity, (i) {{the interaction between the}} acoustic and hydrodynamic subsystems is calculated and (ii) the role of the global acceleration term, which is the coupling term from the acoustics to the hydrodynamics, is analysed. For the confined coaxial jet diffusion flame studied here, (i) the growth rate of the thermo-acoustic oscillations is found to be more sensitive to small changes in the hydrodynamic field around the flame and (ii) increasing the global acceleration term is found to be stabilizing in agreement with the Rayleigh Criterion...|$|R
