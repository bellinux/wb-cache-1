25|$|In October 1966 Duarte Nuno petitioned an {{ecclesiastical court}} of the Diocese of Madrid-Alcala to remove the name of King Carlos from the baptismal {{certificate}} of Maria Pia de Bragança. Duarte Nuno claimed {{that there was no}} evidence that King Carlos was the father of Maria Pia. It is unusual for a baptismal registration to record the father of a bastard child. The Roman Ritual instructs the officiating priest only to record the father’s name if the father himself requests it or if he is known to be the father from some public <b>authentic</b> <b>document</b> (Titulus XII, caput II). Clearly King Carlos was not present at Maria Pia's baptism, but Maria Pia claimed that the copy of the document purportedly signed by Carlos granting her the rights of the princes of Portugal was sufficient justification in ecclesiastical law for Carlos to be named her father on her baptismal certificate.|$|E

Leland describes her as belonging to a vanishing tradition of sorcery. [...] He writes that [...] "by long practice [...] has perfectly learned ... just what I want, and how to extract it from those of her kind." [...] He received several hundred pages worth of material from her, which was incorporated into his books Etruscan Roman Remains in Popular Tradition, Legends of Florence Collected From the People, and eventually Aradia. Leland wrote that he had [...] "learned that there was in existence a manuscript setting forth the doctrines of Italian witchcraft" [...] in 1886, and had urged Maddalena to find it. Eleven years later, on 1 January 1897, Leland received the Vangelo by post. The manuscript was written in Maddalena's handwriting. Leland understood {{it to be an}} <b>authentic</b> <b>document</b> of the [...] "Old Religion" [...] of the witches, but explains {{that he did not know}} if the text came from written or oral sources.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to reflect on the notion of {{authenticity}} and the use of authentic materials in English for Specific Purposes (ESP). In the professional context, ESP requires the use of specialized and <b>authentic</b> <b>documents.</b> Within the framework of a professional language for specific purposes program, this article firstly proposes a definition of the notion of authenticity before undertaking to examine various forms and applications of <b>authentic</b> <b>documents</b> or tasks. The author also proposes the conception of a new paradigm model for authenticity in the shape of a diamond, which is based on the synthesis of existing qualitative research studies. In this paradigm, authenticity and the language teacher are at the core of language teaching which brings together the learners (and their needs), the professional tasks and the <b>authentic</b> <b>documents.</b> In order to better appreciate the usefulness of <b>authentic</b> <b>documents</b> – such as video, sound, texts and photos – in the ESP context, the pedagogical approaches and criteria which are involved in choosing appropriate authentic materials and tasks are also shared. In addition, the article offers insight into current research on how to successfully integrate authentic materials into the ESP teaching environment through the use of film and television series. The critical research and findings of this article are of use to teachers of language (for specific purposes teachers) or language didacticians who wish to focus on the use of <b>authentic</b> <b>documents</b> when preparing their syllabus. Finally, this article shows that simplifying <b>authentic</b> <b>documents</b> is not always in the best interest of learners who are preparing for careers which require candidates who are professional and ready for employment...|$|R

60|$|Now I {{have read}} you these {{passages}} from Dean Stanley {{as the most}} accurately investigatory, the most generously sympathetic, the most reverently acceptant account of these days, and their people, which you can yet find in any English history. But consider now, point by point, where it leaves you. You are told, first, that you are living {{in an age of}} poetry. But the days of poetry are those of Shakespeare and Milton, not of Bede: nay, for their especial wealth in melodious theology and beautifully rhythmic and pathetic meditation, perhaps the days which have given us 'Hiawatha,' 'In Memoriam,' 'The Christian Year,' and the 'Soul's Diary' of George Macdonald, may be not with disgrace compared with those of Caedmon. And nothing can be farther different from the temper, nothing less conscious of the effort, of a poet, than any finally <b>authentic</b> <b>document</b> to which you can be referred for the relation of a Saxon miracle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{need not}} say I have the {{greatest}} interest in the MS. which you mention. In case it shall really prove an <b>authentic</b> <b>document,</b> {{there would not be}} the least difficulty in getting the Bannatyne Club to take, perhaps, 100 copies, or obtaining support enough so as, at the least, to preclude the possibility of loss to the ingenious Messrs. Hay Allan. But I think it indispensable that the original MS. should be sent for a month or so to the Register House under the charge of the Deputy Register, Mr. Thomson, that its antiquity be closely scrutinised by competent persons. The art of imitating ancient writing has got to a considerable perfection, and it has been the bane of Scottish literature, and disgrace of her antiquities, that we have manifested an eager propensity to believe without inquiry and propagate the errors which we adopt too hastily ourselves. The general proposition that the Lowlanders ever wore plaids is difficult to swallow. They were of twenty different races, and almost all distinctly different from the Scots Irish, who are the proper Scots, from which the Royal Family are descended. For instance, there is scarce a great family in the Lowlands of Scotland that is not to be traced to the Normans, the proudest as well as most civilised race in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Is it natural to think that holding the Scots in the contempt in which they did, they would have adopted their dress? If you will look at Bruce's speech to David I., as the historian Ælred tells the story, you will see he talks of the Scots as a British officer would do of Cherokees. Or take our country, the central and western part of the border: it was British, Welsh if you please, with the language and manners of that people who certainly wore no tartan. It is needless to prosecute this, though I could show, I think, that there is no period in Scottish History when the manners, language, or dress of the Highlanders were adopted in the Low Country. They brought them with them from Ireland, as you will see from the very curious prints in Derrick's picture of Ireland, where you see the chiefs and followers of the wild Irish in the ordinary Highland dress, tempore Queen Elizabeth. Besides this, where has slept this universal custom that nowhere, unless in this MS., is it even heard of? Lesley knew it not, though the work had been in his possession, and his attention must have been called to it when writing concerning the three races of Scots--Highlanders, Lowlanders, and Bordermen, and treating of their dress in particular. Andrew Borde knows nothing of it, nor the Frenchman who published the geographical work from which Pinkerton copied the prints of the Highlander and Lowlander, the former in a frieze plaid or mantle, while the Lowlander struts away in a cloak and trunk hose, liker his neighbour the Fleming. I will not state other objections, though so many occur, that the authenticity of the MS. being proved, I would rather suppose the author had been some tartan-weaver zealous for his craft, who wished to extend the use of tartan over the whole kingdom. I have been told, and believe till now, that the use of tartan was never general in Scotland (Lowlands) until the Union, when the detestation of that measure led it to be adopted as the national colour, and the ladies all affected tartan screens or mantles.|$|E
