40|$|Noise-induced {{hearing loss}} (NIHL) {{continues}} to be a concern of the mining industry. A new noise standard (30 CFR, Part 62) is aimed at reducing NIHL in mining through engineering and <b>administrative</b> noise <b>controls.</b> However, the difficulty and expense of implementing engineering <b>controls</b> can make <b>administrative</b> <b>controls</b> an attractive alternative for reducing worker noise exposure. Over the last three years, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has conducted worker noise exposure surveys in underground and surface coal mines and in coal preparation plants. The surveys revealed numerous possible <b>administrative</b> <b>controls</b> and an approach to implementation and analysis. The surveys have shown that worker dosimetry, time-motion studies and equipment noise profiling are important aspects of effectively utilizing <b>administrative</b> <b>controls.</b> A description of the approach for selecting, implementing and evaluating <b>administrative</b> <b>controls</b> and a list of possible <b>administrative</b> <b>controls</b> are reported...|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} I./ JG 1 {{based in}} Jesau, played little {{part in the}} Invasion of Poland. Within Eastern Prussia, they were re-deployed to three forward bases; Heiligenbeil, Schippenbeil and Arys-Rostken. I./JG 1 had negligible involvement and no enemy aircraft were downed. The only casualty was a pilot of 2./JG 1 injured by friendly flak. On 5 September 1939, the group returned to Jesau. After a ten-day stop in Lübeck-Blankensee, the group arrived at Vörden. Although I./JG 1 came under <b>administrative</b> <b>control</b> of JG 27, I./JG 1 was temporarily put under <b>administrative</b> <b>control</b> of JG 77 on 4 June 1940. It came back under control of JG 27 few days later.|$|E

50|$|<b>Administrative</b> <b>controls</b> are {{fourth in}} larger {{hierarchy}} of hazard controls, which ranks the effectiveness {{and efficiency of}} hazard <b>controls.</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>controls</b> are more effective than PPE because they involve some manner of prior planning and avoidance, whereas PPE only serves only as a final barrier between the hazard and worker. <b>Administrative</b> <b>controls</b> are second lowest because they require workers or employers to actively think or comply with regulations and do not offer permanent solutions to problems. Generally, <b>administrative</b> <b>controls</b> are cheaper to begin, but they may become more expensive over time as higher failure rates {{and the need for}} constant training or re-certification eclipse the initial investments of the three more desirable hazard controls in the hierarchy. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends <b>administrative</b> <b>controls</b> when hazards cannot be removed or changed, and engineering controls are not practical.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Administrative</b> <b>controls</b> are training, procedure, policy, or shift {{designs that}} lessen {{the threat of}} a hazard to an individual. [...] <b>Administrative</b> <b>controls</b> {{typically}} change the behavior of people (e.g., factory workers) rather than removing the hazard or providing personal protective equipment (PPE).|$|R

5|$|Diệm faced {{challenges}} to his authority from four more groups. The Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài religious sects had private armies that controlled the Mekong Delta and the areas west of Saigon, respectively. The Bình Xuyên was an armed, organised crime empire that controlled much of Saigon with a 40,000strong private army, while the Vietminh still controlled {{much of the}} rural area. Diệm's Vietnamese National Army (VNA) was led by General Nguyễn Văn Hinh, a French citizen who loathed and frequently disobeyed him. Bảo Đại sold the operating license of the national police to the Bình Xuyên, effectively putting <b>administrative</b> <b>control</b> of the police {{in the hands of}} a crime syndicate.|$|E

5|$|During the 1936–39 Arab {{revolt against}} British Mandate rule, Deir Ghassaneh {{was the scene}} of rebel gatherings and British {{military}} raids. In 1967, Bani Zeid was occupied by Israel during the Six-Day War, but it was transferred to full Palestinian security and <b>administrative</b> <b>control</b> in 2000. The next year it became the first Palestinian-controlled town to be the site of major operation by Israeli forces during the Second Intifada. When Fathiya Barghouti Rheime was elected mayor in 2005, Bani Zeid became the first Palestinian locality with a woman as head of the municipality, in concurrence with nearby Ramallah. The current mayor is Abdel Karim Abu Aql, elected in 2012.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June 1936, all {{police forces}} {{throughout}} Germany were united under {{the purview of}} Himmler and the SS. Himmler and Heydrich thus became {{two of the most}} powerful men in the country's administration. Police and intelligence forces brought under their <b>administrative</b> <b>control</b> included the SD, Gestapo, Kriminalpolizei (Kripo; criminal investigative police), and Ordnungspolizei (Orpo; regular uniformed police). In September 1939, the security and police agencies, including the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo; security police) and SD (but not the Orpo), were consolidated into the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), headed by Heydrich. This further increased the collective authority of the SS.|$|E

On March 1942 the Army Air Force activated Wendover Army Air Field and also assigned the research and development of guided missiles, pilotless aircraft, and remotely controlled bombs to the site. The new base was supplied and serviced by the Ogden Air Depot at Hill Field. In April 1942, the Wendover Sub-Depot was activated and assumed technical and <b>administrative</b> <b>control</b> of the field, under the Ogden Air Depot.

5|$|Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and {{the valley}} itself during the First Kashmir War, but the intense {{fighting}} flagged {{with the onset}} of winter, which made much of the state impassable. Prime Minister Nehru, recognising the degree of international attention brought to bear on the dispute, declared a ceasefire and sought UN arbitration, arguing that India would otherwise have to invade Pakistan itself, in view of its failure to stop the tribal incursions. The plebiscite was never held, and on 26 January 1950, the Constitution of India came into force in Kashmir, but with special provisions made for the state. India did not, however, secure <b>administrative</b> <b>control</b> over all of Kashmir. The northern and western portions of Kashmir came under Pakistan's control in 1947, and are today Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

An autoclave uses steam and pressure to sterilize the waste or reduce its microbiological load to a level at which it may be safely disposed of. Many healthcare facilities routinely use an autoclave to sterilize medical supplies. If the same autoclave is used to sterilize supplies and treat biomedical waste, <b>administrative</b> <b>controls</b> must be used to prevent the waste operations from contaminating the supplies. Effective <b>administrative</b> <b>controls</b> include operator training, strict procedures, and separate times and space for processing biomedical waste.|$|R
50|$|<b>Administrative</b> <b>controls</b> are {{changes to}} workers' {{behavior}} to mitigate a hazard. They include training on best practices for safe handling, storage, {{and disposal of}} nanomaterials, proper awareness of hazards through labeling and warning signage, and encouraging a general safety culture. <b>Administrative</b> <b>controls</b> can complement engineering controls should they fail, or {{when they are not}} feasible or do not reduce exposures to an acceptable level. Some examples of good work practices include cleaning work spaces with wet-wiping methods or a HEPA-filtered vacuum cleaner instead of dry sweeping with a broom, avoiding handling nanomaterials in a free particle state, storing nanomaterials in containers with tightly closed lids. Normal safety procedures such as hand washing, not storing or consuming food in the laboratory, and proper disposal of hazardous waste are also <b>administrative</b> <b>controls.</b> Other examples are limiting the time workers are handling a material or in a hazardous area, and exposure monitoring for the presence of nanomaterials.|$|R
