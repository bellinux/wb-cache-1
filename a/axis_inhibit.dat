40|$|EXPERIMENTAL OBJECTIVES: The {{interaction}} between the endocrine and immune systems is a very intriguing area. Endogenous glucocorticoids, as end-effectors of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal <b>axis,</b> <b>inhibit</b> the immune and inflammatory responses and are used as immunosuppressive drugs in many inflammatory, autoimmune and allergic diseases. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the effects of dexamethasone on the profile of cytokine secretion in whole blood cell cultures from healthy subjects and to analyse the gender-related sensitivity to dexamethasone on each cytokine secretion. RESULTS: There was a significant inhibition by dexamethasone (from 1 to 100 nM) on the secretion of monokines (IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, IL- 8 and TNF alpha) and lymphokines (IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 10 and IFN gamma), either after LPS or PHA stimulation (P < 0. 01). Interleukin 4 and IL- 10 were less inhibited than IFN gamma (P < 0. 05 at 1 nM, P < 0. 01 at 10 nM and P < 0. 001 from 100 nM to 10 microM). No gender difference was observed in the rate of inhibition of the secretion of each cytokine. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the inhibition of cytokine secretion by dexamethasone is more marked on Th 1 -type cytokines than on Th 2 -type cytokines. These data support the idea that glucocorticoids may induce a shift from the Th 1 to Th 2 profile of cytokine secretion. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|Environmental {{and genetic}} {{activation}} of a brain-adipocyte <b>axis</b> <b>inhibits</b> cancer progression. Leptin {{is the primary}} peripheral mediator of this anticancer effect in a mouse model of melanoma. In this study we assessed {{the effect of a}} leptin receptor antagonist on melanoma progression. Local administration of a neutralizing nanobody targeting the leptin receptor at low dose adjacent to tumor decreased tumor mass with no effects on body weight or food intake. In contrast, systemic administration of the nanobody failed to suppress tumor growth. Daily intraperitoneal injection of high-dose nanobody led to weight gain, hyperphagia, increased adiposity, hyperleptinemia, and hyperinsulinemia, and central effects mimicking leptin deficiency. The blockade of central actions of leptin by systemic delivery of nanobody may compromise its anticancer effect, underscoring the need to develop peripherally acting leptin antagonists coupled with efficient cancer-targeting delivery...|$|R
40|$|SummaryWhile {{chemotherapy}} strongly restricts or reverses tumor growth, {{the response}} of host tissue to therapy can counteract its anti-tumor activity by promoting tumor re-growth and/or metastases, thus limiting therapeutic efficacy. Here, we show that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR 3) -expressing macrophages infiltrating chemotherapy-treated tumors {{play a significant role}} in metastasis. They do so in part by inducing lymphangiogenesis as a result of cathepsin release, leading to VEGF-C upregulation by heparanase. We found that macrophages from chemotherapy-treated mice are sufficient to trigger lymphatic vessel activity and structure in naive tumors in a VEGFR 3 -dependent manner. Blocking VEGF-C/VEGFR 3 <b>axis</b> <b>inhibits</b> the activity of chemotherapy-educated macrophages, leading to reduced lymphangiogenesis in treated tumors. Overall, our results suggest that disrupting the VEGF-C/VEGFR 3 axis not only directly inhibits lymphangiogenesis but also blocks the pro-metastatic activity of macrophages in chemotherapy-treated mice...|$|R
40|$|The present review crucially aims to {{highlight}} the relationship between various types of stress and change in male and female reproductive function. Chronic anxiety, depression, psychogenic distress, physical exertion–related stress consistently activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Almost each component of this activated axis, such as CRH, ACTH, β-endorphin and glucocorticoids exerts profound inhibitory effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and subsequently leads to reproductive failure in males and females. The pulsatile secretion of GnRH and the response of gonadotroph to GnRH stimulation are severely impaired. Increased levels of corticoids <b>inhibit</b> gonadal <b>axis</b> at the hypothalamic, pituitary and ovarian levels and concurrently result in deficient ovarian function. Similarly, the <b>axis</b> <b>inhibits</b> at the testicular levels and severely affects testosterone levels, sperm production and sperm quality. Therefore, {{it is clear from}} the present review that activation of stress systems could potentially influence reproduction at any level of the hypothalamo-pituitary- gonadal axis...|$|R
40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} beta 1 (TGFB 1) is implicated {{as a key}} {{regulator}} of the development and cyclic remodelling characteristic of reproductive tissues. The physiological significance of TGFB 1 in reproductive biology and fertility has been extensively examined in Tgfb 1 null mutant mice. Genetic deficiency in TGFB 1 causes perturbed functioning of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal <b>axis,</b> <b>inhibiting</b> luteinising hormone (LH) synthesis and leading to downstream effects on testosterone production in males and estrous cycle abnormalities in females. Oocyte developmental incompetence, accompanied by early embryo arrest as well as altered pubertal mammary gland morphogenesis are observed. In addition to LH and testosterone deficiency, male Tgfb 1 null mice demonstrate complete inability to mate with females, associated with failure to initiate and/or sustain successful penile intromission or ejaculation. These studies demonstrate the profound significance of TGFB 1 in male and female reproductive physiology, and provide a foundation for exploring {{the significance of this}} cytokine in human infertility and sexual dysfunction.

Here, {{we show that}} Ucp 1 expression is also regulated post-transcriptionally. In inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), Ucp 1 level decreases concomitantly with increases in Cnot 7 and its interacting partner Tob. HFD-fed mice lacking Cnot 7 and Tob express elevated levels of Ucp 1 mRNA in iWAT and are resistant to diet-induced obesity. Ucp 1 mRNA has an elongated poly(A) tail and persists in iWAT of Cnot 7 −/− and/or Tob−/− mice on a HFD. Ucp 1 3 ′-UTR-containing mRNA is more stable in cells expressing mutant Tob that is unable to bind Cnot 7 than in WT Tob-expressing cells.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{research}} {{has examined the}} endocrine-disrupting action of various environmental pollutants, including hormones, pharmaceuticals, and surfactants, in sewage treatment plant effluent. Responding {{to the growth of}} concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and the pollutants present in their wastewater (e. g., nutrients, pharmaceuticals, and hormones), the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency developed a new rule that tightens the regulation of CAFOs. In this study, we collected wild fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to feedlot effluent (FLE) and observed significant alterations in their reproductive biology. Male fish were demasculinized (having lower testicular testosterone synthesis, altered head morphometrics, and smaller testis size). Defeminization of females, as evidenced by a decreased estrogen:androgen ratio of in vitro steroid hormone synthesis, was also documented. We did not observe characteristics in either male or female fish indicative of exposure to environmental estrogens. Using cells transfected with the human androgen receptor, we detected potent androgenic responses from the FLE. Taken together, our morphologic, endocrinologic, and in vitro gene activation assay data suggest two hypotheses: a) there are potent androgenic substance(s) in the FLE, and/or b) there is a complex mixture of androgenic and estrogenic substances that alter the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal <b>axis,</b> <b>inhibiting</b> the release of gonadotropin-releasin...|$|R
40|$|In the {{classical}} model of chick wing digit- patterning(1), the polarizing region - {{a group of}} cells at the posterior margin of the early bud - produces a morphogen gradient, now known {{to be based on}} Sonic hedgehog (Shh) (2, 3), that progressively specifies anteroposterior positional identities in the posterior digit- forming region(4). Here we add an integral growth component to this model by showing that Shh- dependent proliferation of prospective digit progenitor cells is essential for specifying the complete pattern of digits across the anteroposterior <b>axis.</b> <b>Inhibiting</b> Shh signalling in early wing buds reduced anteroposterior expansion, and posterior digits were lost because all prospective digit precursors formed anterior structures. Inhibiting proliferation also irreversibly reduced anteroposterior expansion, but instead anterior digits were lost because all prospective digit precursors formed posterior structures. When proliferation recovered in such wings, Shh transcription was maintained for longer than normal, suggesting that duration of Shh expression is controlled by a mechanism that measures proliferation. Rescue experiments confirmed that Shh- dependent proliferation controls digit number during a discrete time- window in which Shh- dependent specification normally occurs. Our findings that Shh signalling has dual functions that can be temporally uncoupled have implications for understanding congenital and evolutionary digit reductions...|$|R
50|$|Mouse studies {{indicate}} that the PGI2-IP axis activates cellular signaling pathways that tend to suppress allergic inflammation. The <b>axis</b> <b>inhibits</b> bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (i.e. antigen-presenting cells that process antigen material, present it on their surfaces for delivery to T cells, and otherwise regulate innate and adaptive immune system responses) from producing pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-12, TNF-alpha, IL-1-alpha, and IL-6) while stimulating them to increase production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. IP receptor activation of these cells also blocks their lipopolysaccharide-stimulated expression of pro-inflammatory cell surface proteins (i.e. CD86, CD40, and MHC class II molecules) that are critical for developing adaptive immune responses. IL receptor-activated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells showed a greatly reduced ability to stimulate the proliferation of T helper cell {{as well as the}} ability of these cells to produce pro-allergic cytokines (i.e. IL-5 and IL-13)s. In a mouse model of allergic inflammation, PGI2 reduced the maturation and migration of lung mature dendritic cells to Mediastinal lymph nodes while increasing the egress of immature dendritic cells away from the lung. These effects resulted in a decrease in allergen-induced responses of the cells mediating allergic reactivity, TH-2 cells. These IP-induced responses likely contribute to its apparent function in inhibiting certain mouse inflammation responses as exemplified by the failure of IP receptor deficient mice to develop full lung airway allergic responses to ovalbumin in a model of allergic inflammation.|$|R
5000|$|Familial adenomatous {{polyposis}} is a syndrome {{that includes}} the propensity to develop colorectal cancer (and other cancers) due to the inheritance of defective mutations in either the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) or MUTYH gene. These mutations lead to several abnormalities in the regulation {{of the growth of}} colon epithelial cells that ultimately lead to the development of intestinal polyps which have a high risk of turning cancerous. [...] One of the abnormalities found in the APC disease is progressive reductions in 15-lipoxygenase 1 along with its product, 13-HODE (presumed but not unambiguously shown to be the S stereoisomer) as the colon disease advances from polyp to malignant stages; 15-HETE, 5-lipoxygenase, 12-lipoxygenase, and 15-lipoxygenase-2, and selected metabolites of the latter lipoxygenases show no such association. [...] Similarly selective reductions in 15-lipoxygenase 1 and 13-HODE occur in non-hereditary colon cancer. [...] 13(S)-HODE inhibits the proliferation and causes the death (apoptosis) of cultured human colon cancer cells. Animal model studies also find that the 15-lipoxygenase 1 / 13-HODE <b>axis</b> <b>inhibits</b> the development of drug-induced colon cancer as well as the growth of human colon cancer cell explants. [...] These results suggest that 15-lipoxygenase 1 and its 13(S)-HODE product are factors in promoting genetically-associated and -non-associated colon cancers; they function by contributing to the suppression of the development and/or growth of this cancer and when reduced or absent allow its unrestrained, malignant growth.|$|R

However, their function and specific mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify a novel lncRNA-microRNA-mRNA functional network in gastric cancer. Methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to assess the relative expression of H 19 and miR- 675 in normal (GES- 1) and gastric cancer cell lines (SGC- 7901, SGC- 7901 /DDP) as well as in tumor tissues. Gain and loss of function approaches were carried out to investigate the potential roles of H 19 /miR- 675 in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, Fas associated via death domain (FADD) was validated to be the target of miR- 675 via luciferase reporter assay. Western blotting was used to evaluate the protein expression of related signaling pathway. Results: In our study H 19 and miR- 675 were increased in gastric cancer cell lines and tissues. Overexpression of H 19 and miR- 675 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis, whereas knockdown of H 19 and miR- 675 inhibited these effects. By further examining the underlying mechanism, we showed that H 19 /miR- 675 <b>axis</b> <b>inhibited</b> expression of FADD. FADD downregulation subsequently inhibited the caspase cleavage cascades including caspase 8 and caspase 3.

40|$|International audienceThe {{pathogenesis}} {{of hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection is {{strongly influenced by}} the nature of the host's antiviral immunity. Counterintuitively, elevated serum concentrations of C-X-C chemokine 10 (CXCL 10), a potent chemoattractant for antiviral T-cells and NK-cells, are associated with poor treatment outcomes in patients with chronic HCV. It has been reported that an N-terminal truncated form of CXCL 10, generated by the protease dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP 4), can act as chemokine antagonist. We sought to investigate CXCL 10 antagonism in the clinical outcome and evolution of acute HCV infection. We collected serial blood samples from 16 patients, at the clinical onset of acute HCV infection and at 12 standardized follow-up timepoints over the first year. Intact and truncated CXCL 10 and DPP 4 activity were quantified in all longitudinal samples. In addition, NK-cell frequency/phenotype, and HCV-specific T-cell responses were assessed. Subjects developing chronicity (n[*]=[*] 11) had higher concentrations of CXCL 10 (P[*]<[*] 0. 001), which was predominantly in a truncated form (P[*]=[*] 0. 036) compared to patients who spontaneously resolved infection (n[*]=[*] 5). Truncated CXCL 10 correlated with HCV-RNA (r[*]=[*] 0. 40, P[*]<[*] 0. 001) and DPP 4 activity (r[*]=[*] 0. 53, P[*]<[*] 0. 001). Subjects who resolved infection had a higher frequency of HCV-specific interferon-gamma (IFNγ) -producing T-cells (P[*]=[*] 0. 017) and predominance of cytotoxic NK-cells (P[*]=[*] 0. 005) compared to patients who became chronic. Patients who became persistently infected had higher proportions of cytokine-producing NK-cells, which were correlated with concentrations of truncated CXCL 10 (r[*]=[*] 0. 92, P[*]<[*] 0. 001). CONCLUSION:This study provides the first evidence of chemokine antagonism during acute HCV infection.

Para contribuir com o entendimento dos mecanismos envolvidos na resposta proliferativa do córtex adrenal analisamos os efeitos desencadeados por ambos os peptídeos em ratos cujo eixo HPA foi inibido pela dexametasona.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether and how adenosine affects the proliferation of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs). In HCASMCs, 2 -chloroadenosine (stable adenosine analogue), but not N 6 -cyclopentyladenosine, CGS 21680, or N 6 -(3 -iodobenzyl) -adenosine- 5 ′-N-methyluronamide, inhibited HCASMC proliferation (A 2 B receptor profile). 2 -Chloroadenosine increased cAMP, reduced phosphorylation (activation) of ERK and Akt (protein kinases known to increase cyclin D expression and activity, respectively), and reduced levels of cyclin D 1 (cyclin that promotes cell-cycle progression in G 1). Moreover, 2 -chloroadenosine inhibited expression of S-phase kinase–associated protein- 2 (Skp 2; promotes proteolysis of p 27 Kip 1) and upregulated levels of p 27 Kip 1 (cell-cycle regulator that impairs cyclin D function). 2 -Chloroadenosine also inhibited signaling downstream of cyclin D, including hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and expression of cyclin A (S phase cyclin). Knockdown of A 2 B receptors prevented the effects of 2 -chloroadenosine on ERK 1 / 2, Akt, Skp 2, p 27 Kip 1, cyclin D 1, cyclin A, and proliferation. Likewise, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A abrogated 2 -chloroadenosine’s inhibitory effects on Skp 2 and stimulatory effects on p 27 Kip 1 and rescued HCASMCs from 2 -chloroadenosine–mediated inhibition. Knockdown of p 27 Kip 1 also reversed the inhibitory effects of 2 -chloroadenosine on HCASMC proliferation. In vivo, peri-arterial (rat carotid artery) 2 -chloroadenosine (20 μmol/L for 7 days) downregulated vascular expression of Skp 2, upregulated vascular expression of p 27 Kip 1, and reduced neointima hyperplasia by 71 % (P< 0. 05; neointimal thickness: control, 37 [*] 424 ± 18 [*] 371 pixels; treated, 10 [*] 352 ± 2824 pixels). In conclusion, the adenosine/A 2 B receptor/cAMP/protein kinase A <b>axis</b> <b>inhibits</b> HCASMC proliferation by blocking multiple signaling pathways (ERK 1 / 2, Akt, and Skp 2) that converge at cyclin D, a key G 1 cyclin that controls cell-cycle progression...|$|R
40|$|Wear particle-induced periprosthetic osteolysis {{remains the}} {{principal}} cause of aseptic loosening of orthopaedic implants. Monocytes/macrophages phagocytose wear particles and release cytokines that induce inflammatory response. This response promotes osteoclast differentiation and osteolysis. The precise {{mechanisms by which}} wear particles are recognized and induce the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the periprosthetic tissue have not been fully elucidated. Recent {{studies have shown that}} toll-like receptors (TLRs) contribute to the cellular interaction with wear particles. Wear particles are recognized by monocytes/macrophages through TLRs coupled with the adaptor protein MyD 88. After the initial interaction, wear particles induce both local and systemic migration of monocytes/macrophages to the periprosthetic region. The cellular migration is mediated through chemokines including interleukin- 8, macrophage chemotactic protein- 1, and macrophage inhibitory protein- 1 in the periprosthetic tissues.

We identified a RNA helicase, DDX 3, which is overexpressed in many cancer types including lung cancer and is associated with lower survival in lung cancer patients. We designed a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor, RK- 33, which binds to DDX 3 and abrogates its activity. Inhibition of DDX 3 by RK- 33 caused G 1 cell cycle arrest, induced apoptosis, and promoted radiation sensitization in DDX 3 -overexpressing cells. Importantly, RK- 33 in combination with radiation induced tumor regression in multiple mouse models of lung cancer. Mechanistically, loss of DDX 3 function either by shRNA or by RK- 33 impaired Wnt signaling through disruption of the DDX 3 –b-catenin <b>axis</b> and <b>inhibited</b> non-homologous end joining—the major DNA repair pathway in mammalian somatic cells.

40|$|Prednisolone, {{a potent}} {{anti-inflammatory}} drug, has proved ineffective in treating {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is associated with superoxide (O 2 •−) generation, which negates nitric oxide (NO). NO also downregulates NADPH oxidase and inhibits O 2 •− formation. A possible reason {{for the lack of}} effect of prednisolone may due to an inhibition of eNOS expression. In order to test this proposal, the effect of prednisolone on O 2 •− formation and the expression of gp 91 phox (catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase) and eNOS in pig pulmonary artery (PA) segments and PA endothelial cells (PAECs) and PA vascular smooth muscle cells (PAVSMCs) was investigated. PA segments and cells were incubated with prednisolone and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) for 16 [*]h. O 2 •− formation was measured spectrophometrically and gp 91 phox and eNOS expression by Western blotting. The role of the NO–cGMP axis was studied using morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride, the diethylamine/NO complex (DETA-NONOate), the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, 1 H-{ 1, 2, 4 }oxadiazolo{ 4, 3 -a}quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ) and the stable cGMP analogues, 8 -bromo cGMP and 8 -(4 -chlorophenylthio) -cGMP (8 -pCPT-cGMP). NO release was studied using a fluorescence assay and O 2 •−–NO interactions with a nitrite/nitrate assay. Prednisolone elicited significant increase in O 2 •− formation in intact PA segments and PAECs, but not PAVSMCs, in a concentration-dependent manner. In endothelium-denuded segments, prednisolone slightly enhanced O 2 •− release. TNF-α further increased prednisolone-enhanced O 2 •− formation in intact PA segments and PAECs. NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin, inhibited O 2 •− formation. Increased O 2 •− release and gp 91 phox expression in PAECs elicited by prednisolone was blocked by SIN- 1 (3 -morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride), DETA-NONOate, 8 -pCPT-cGMP and 8 -bromo cGMP. The effects of SIN- 1 on gp 91 phox expression were reversed by ODQ. Finally, eNOS protein expression was significantly reduced by prednisolone. Prednisolone increases O 2 •− in porcine PAECs through a downregulation of endogenous eNOS expression. Since the NO–cGMP <b>axis</b> <b>inhibits</b> gp 91 phox expression, the resultant decrease in endogenous NO formation then augments NADPH oxidase activity, which in turn results in increased O 2 •− formation. Since O 2 •− promotes inflammation, this mechanism may explain why prednisolone is ineffective in treating ARDS. Therapeutically, the coadministration of an NO donor may render prednisolone more effective in treating ARDS...|$|R

After modeling, there was a significant prolongation of immobility time in administration groups with the TST and FST. High-dose Shuyusan could reduce the immobility time measured with the TST and FST. The immobility time in high-dose herbs group and fluoxetine group was increased significantly compared with the model group. After 3 weeks herbs fed, the serum contents level of CRH, ACTH, and CORT in high-dose herb group was significantly decreased compared to the model group. The result indicated that Shuyusan had antidepressant activity effects on UCMS model rats. The potential antidepressant effect may be related to decreasing glucocorticoid levels activity, regulating the function of HPA <b>axis,</b> and <b>inhibiting</b> glucocorticoid receptor expression in hippocampus...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of Prostate Cancer (PCa) progression through hormone-dependent to hormone refractory form is still unclear. Many {{data indicate that}} JAK/STAT signaling contributes to tumor resistance and STAT 3 hyperactivation is observed {{in a variety of}} human cancers. Moreover, several authors suggested that ERp 57 (GRP 58 /PDIA 3), a disulfide isomerases protein, is associated with modulation of STAT 3 activity. We investigate the role of STAT 3 -ERp 57 -TPX 2 axis in the ormone-responsive and androgen-refractory tumor using human PCa cell lines, LNCaP (androgen-sensitive) and PC 3 (androgen-refractory), untreated and stimulated with IL- 6 and EGF. Immunoblotting and CoIP analysis were performed to confirm STAT 3 activation and ERp 57 -STAT 3 interaction. To investigate the physiological relevance of STAT 3 -ERp 57 -TPX 2 <b>axis,</b> we <b>inhibited</b> STAT 3 or ERp 57 activity and the expression levels of TPX 2 was monitored by qRT-PCR. The results showed that increased STAT 3 -ERp 57 complex association determines an TPX 2 overexpression. In conclusion, this study showed that STAT 3 -ERp 57 -TPX 2 axis is correlated with tumor progression and it suggests a functional role of STAT 3 /ERp 57 complex in the Androgen Escape...|$|R
40|$|Some {{environmental}} factors {{may influence the}} pituitary-gonadal function. Among these, light {{plays an important role}} in animal and in humans. The effect of light on the endocrine system is mediated by the pineal gland, through the modulation of melatonin secretion. In fact, melatonin secretion is stimulated by darkness and suppressed by light, thus its circadian rhythm peaks at night. Light plays a favourable action on the hypothalamic-pituitary <b>axis</b> likely <b>inhibiting</b> melatonin secretion, even if the exogenous melatonin administration does not seem to impair the hormonal secretions of this axis. The basal and rhythmic pituitary-gonadal hormone secretions is regulated by a central clock gene and some independent clock genes present in the peripheral tissues. Light is able to induce the expression of some of these genes, thus playing an important role in regulating the hormonal secretions of pituitary -gonadal axis and the sexual and reproductive function in animals and humans. The lack of light stimulus in blind subjects induces increased plasma melatonin concentrations with a free-running rhythm of secretion, which impairs the hormonal secretions of pituitary-gonadal axis, causing disorders of reproductive processes in both sexes. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Abscisic acid (ABA) is an {{effective}} inhibitor of cell elongation in excised embryonic bean axes whether added prior to or after the initiation of cell elongation. Zeatin partially reverses this growth inhibition. ABA inhibits 32 P incorporation into ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, and DNA but not into the tenaciously bound fraction of elongating axes in a manner resembling 5 -fluorouracil, a compound which does not <b>inhibit</b> <b>axis</b> growth. The methylated albumin on kie-selguhr elution profiles of nucleic acids obtained from axes treated with either ABA, 5 -fluorouracil, {{or a combination of}} the two are similar, and zeatin treatment has little apparent effect on these results. Our results suggest that the inhibition of growth in the axes by ABA is not due to its inhibition of DNA synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Using a yeast two-hybrid method, we {{identified}} a novel protein which interacts with glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK- 3 β). This protein had 44 % amino acid identity with Axin, a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. We designated this protein Axil for Axin like. Like Axin, Axil ventralized Xenopus embryos and inhibited Xwnt 8 -induced Xenopus axis duplication. Axil was phosphorylated by GSK- 3 β. Axil bound {{not only to}} GSK- 3 β but also to β-catenin, and the GSK- 3 β-binding site of Axil was distinct from the β-catenin-binding site. Furthermore, Axil enhanced GSK- 3 β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin. These results indicate that Axil negatively regulates the Wnt signaling pathway by mediating GSK- 3 β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin, thereby <b>inhibiting</b> <b>axis</b> formation...|$|R
40|$|Irradiation has {{adverse effects}} on {{reproductive}} aspects such as spermatogenic cell population and cell malformation, leading to reduced sperm count and non-viable spermatozoa. This has overshadowed possible effects of radiation exposure on biochemical environment throughout the epididymis and the viability of spermatozoa that appeared morphologically normal. The  effects of radiation exposure on sperm quality were evaluated through mating trials and assessment of the cauda epididymal sperm motility. Sprague Dawley rats with body mass of 300 – 400 g were selected at random. Two experimental groups received acute 6 °Co γ -radiation doses of 3. 5 and 6. 0 Gy, respectively. Data were collected 2, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days postirradiation Each male was housed with a non-irradiated super-ovulated female during mating trials. Cauda epididymal sperm motility was assessed with the CASMA. Hormone analyses were carried through chemiluminescence diagnostic tests to determine the endocrine status. Results suggest that irradiation causes an overproduction of estrogens, which suppresses the hypothalamic–pituitary <b>axis</b> and <b>inhibits</b> LH and FSH secretions. Both LH and FSH deficiencies have negative effects on the testicular index and local reproductive hormones. Elevated estrogen levels influenced the epididymal internal milieu negatively, resulting in rigid, flagella bending sperm tail, impaired progressive movement of the spermatozoa and hence infertility </strong...|$|R
40|$|Melanoma {{is one of}} {{the deadliest}} human cancers, {{responsible}} for approximately 80 % of skin cancer mortalities. The aggressiveness of melanoma is due to its capacity to proliferate and rapidly invade surrounding tissues, leading to metastases. A recent model suggests melanoma progresses by reversibly switching between proliferation and invasion transcriptional signatures. Recent studies show that cancer cells are more sensitive to microRNA (miRNA) perturbation than are non-cancer cells; however, the roles of miRNAs in melanoma plasticity remain unexplored. Here, we use the gene expression profiles of melanoma and normal melanocytes to characterize the transcription factor–miRNA relationship that modulates the proliferative and invasive programs of melanoma. We identified two sets of miRNAs that likely regulate these programs. Interestingly, one of the miRNAs involved in melanoma invasion is miR- 211, a known target of the master regulator microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). We demonstrate that miR- 211 contributes to melanoma adhesion by directly targeting a gene, NUAK 1. Inhibition of miR- 211 increases NUAK 1 expression and decreases melanoma adhesion, whereas upregulation of miR- 211 restores adhesion through NUAK 1 repression. This study defines the MITF/miR- 211 <b>axis</b> that <b>inhibits</b> the invasive program by blocking adhesion. Furthermore, we have identified NUAK 1 as a potential target for the treatment of metastatic melanoma...|$|R
40|$|Curcumin, a {{selective}} phosphorylase kinase inhibitor, is a naturally occurring phytochemical present in turmeric. Curcumin {{has been confirmed}} to have anti-inflammatory properties {{in addition to the}} ability to decrease the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in keratinocytes. The interleukin- 23 (IL- 23) /IL- 17 A cytokine axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Here, we report that topical use of a curcumin gel formulation strongly inhibited imiquimod (IMQ) -induced psoriasis-like inflammation, the development of which was based on the IL- 23 /IL- 17 A axis. IMQ-induced epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation in BALB/c mouse ear was significantly inhibited following curcumin treatment. Real-time PCR showed that mRNA levels of IL- 17 A, IL- 17 F, IL- 22, IL- 1 b, IL- 6 and TNF-a cytokines were decreased significantly by curcumin in ear skin, an effect similar to that of clobetasol. In addition, we found that curcumin may enhance the proliferation of epidermis cd T cells but inhibit dermal cd T cell proliferation. We inferred that curcumin was capable of impacting the IL- 23 /IL- 17 A <b>axis</b> by <b>inhibiting</b> IL- 1 b/IL- 6 and then indirectly down-regulating IL- 17 A/IL- 22 production. In conclusion, curcumin can relieve the IMQ-induced psoriasis-like inflammation in a mouse model, similar to the effects o...|$|R
40|$|The {{overexpression}} of miR- 221 {{is reported}} in several human cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its targeting by tailored treatments has been proposed. The evidence supporting {{the role of}} miR- 221 in cancer is growing and has been mainly focused on the discovery of miR- 221 targets {{as well as on}} its possible therapeutic exploitations. However, the mechanism sustaining miR- 221 aberrant expression remains to be elucidated. In this study, MDM 2, a known p 53 (TP 53) modulator, is identified as a direct target of miR- 221 and a feed-forward loop is described that sustains miR- 221 aberrant expression. Interestingly, miR- 221 can activate the p 53 /MDM 2 <b>axis</b> by <b>inhibiting</b> MDM 2 and, in turn, p 53 activation contributes to miR- 221 enhanced expression. Moreover, by modulating p 53 axis, miR- 221 impacts cell cycle progression and apoptotic response to Doxorubicin in HCC-derived cell lines. Finally, CpG island methylation status was assessed as a causative event associated with miR- 221 up-regulation in HCC cells and primary tumor specimens. In HCC-derived cell lines, pharmacologically-induced DNA hypomethylation potentiated a significant increase in miR- 221 expression. These data were confirmed in clinical specimens of HCC in which elevated miR- 221 expression was associated with the simultaneous presence of wild-type p 53 and DNA hypomethylation...|$|R
40|$|The CXCL 12 -CXCR 4 {{biological}} axis {{consisting of}} the chemotactic factor CXCL 12 and its specific receptor CXCR 4 {{plays an important role}} in oral cancer metastasis. High expression of CXCR 4 may help oral squamous cancer cells invade local tissues and metastasize to lymph nodes. No obvious association was observed between CXCL 12 expression and lymph node metastasis, suggesting that CXCL 12 chemotaxis may only be related to CXCR 4 expression on the tumor cell membrane. KDEL can be retained by receptors on the surface of the intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and also be called an ER retention signal sequence. So we adopted the KDEL sequence in this study to generate a CXCL 12 -KDEL fusion protein in combination with a traceable E-tag label. As such, CXCL 12 was retained in the ER. Specific receptor CXCR 4 binds to the CXCL 12 -KDEL, was also retained in the ER, and was thus prevented from reaching the oral squamous cancer cell surface. We reduced the cell surface level of CXCR 4 and called the technique “intracellular sequestration. ” By this way, we have finished blocking of CXCL 12 -CXCR 4 biological <b>axis</b> and <b>inhibiting</b> lymph node metastasis of oral carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which intraperitoneal injection of peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -seropositive donors into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice gives rise to lymphomas (hu/SCID tumors) are far from clear. This study addressed whether chemokine receptors and their ligands could be implicated in this experimental model. CXCR 4 {{was found to be}} highly expressed in hu/SCID tumors; surface expression of CXCR 4 was prevalently limited to a tumor cell subset poorly expressing CD 23, whereas the CXCR 4 ligand, CXCL 12, was predominantly expressed by the tumor subpopulation expressing CD 23. In vitro inhibition of this autocrine/paracrine CXCL 12 /CXCR 4 <b>axis</b> significantly <b>inhibited</b> lymphoma proliferation and survival. Furthermore, CXCL 12 was expressed in cells recovered from the mouse peritoneal cavity early after PBMC transfer as well as by EBV-transformed B cells but not by resting or activated B lymphocytes; also, lymphoma development was associated with a dramatic increase in the levels of murine CXCL 12 present in the peritoneal cavity. Finally, antagonizing the CXCL 12 /CXCR 4 axis in vivo strongly counteracted lymphoma development. These studies demonstrate that CXCL 12 expression may be associated with EBV infection and suggest that the CXCR 4 /CXCL 12 axis may participate in the EBV-associated lymphomagenesis process in immunodeficient hosts...|$|R
