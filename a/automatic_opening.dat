500|$|Emerson {{continued}} {{to collaborate with}} other companies on knife-related projects as his own company grew. In some cases these collaborators had become his competition, such as Gerber Knives. In 2002 Emerson collaborated with Gerber Knives to create both companies' first <b>automatic</b> <b>opening</b> knife, the Gerber-Emerson Alliance. In that same year, Emerson collaborated with SureFire Flashlights by making an exclusive CQC-8 (Banana Knife) numbered and marked with the SureFire logo and sold with an identically numbered Emerson-marked Centurion C2 CombatLight. In 2005 Emerson collaborated with Andy Prisco, the CEO of the American Tomahawk Company, to produce the CQC-T Tomahawk. This tomahawk features a curved head machined from 4140 steel with a rear spike and a lightweight fiberglass handle. Although not made by Emerson, the tomahawk was designed by him. In 2007, Emerson announced a collaboration with custom knifemaker and knife thrower Bobby Branton. The collaboration piece is a fixed-blade knife designed primarily for knife throwing dubbed the BETT: Branton-Emerson Tactical Thrower.

2500|$|During the 1950s, {{large numbers}} of folding switchblade or <b>automatic</b> <b>opening</b> knives with locking blades were {{imported}} from Italy to the United States. Most of these switchblades were side-opening designs, though some employed a telescoping blade. [...] These Italian switchblades were commonly and popularly referred to as stilettos, since most incorporated a long, slender blade tapering to a needle-like point, together with a slim-profile handle and vestigial cross-guard. [...] The majority of these Italian stiletto switchblade knives used a now-iconic bayonet-style blade with a single sabre-grind edge (often unsharpened) and a long opposing false edge. [...] As with the medieval stiletto, the stiletto switchblade was designed primarily as an offensive weapon, optimized for thrusting rather than cutting. [...] Most of these knives were designed with a locking device which locked the blade in the open position, and this lock, combined with the stiletto blade profile, enabled the knife {{to be used as}} an effective thrusting or stabbing weapon (unlike most U.S. switchblade designs of the day). [...] Though most switchblade stilettos used a single-edge blade equipped with a long false edge, many variations exist. [...] The stiletto switchblade is produced to this day in Italy and many other countries, and now includes many derivative folding knife designs that incorporate the same basic 'stiletto' or bayonet-style blade profile, including spring-assist, non-locking, and lock blade variants.|$|E
