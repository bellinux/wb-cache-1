500|$|Outfielder Johnny Damon said of Boone's home run: [...] "If we do {{advance to}} the World Series and win, it's a better story that we went through New York. We needed to get back here. This is {{where a lot of}} hearts were broken, and we're in a perfect seat to stop the hurting." [...] Damon told USA Today: [...] "If we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the World Series, it's better to beat the Yankees to get there. Otherwise, {{everybody}} will say, 'Well, you didn't have to face the Yankees.' I think we have the best team, so I hope the best team wins. But the Yankees are no slouches. We know that [...] Sheffield can hit every single pitch thrown to him." ...|$|E

However, the Earl of Wessex traps {{them in a}} pincer {{movement}} between Nottingham and Newark and defeats them all. When his ally the Archbishop wonders aloud why the rebels die so willingly on the swords of his soldiers the Earl replies grimly: [...] "because {{they know that they}} <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> - but not in my time".|$|E

Gingrich also stated in June 2011, [...] "There is a radical Islamist war against America and our allies. It would be helpful if President Obama had found time in his speech tonight to explain to the American people how we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> this war. Giving a speech in isolation about our military operations in Afghanistan without explaining how it connects with a larger strategy for winning the war against radical Islamists does not help Americans understand what it will take to provide for the security of the American people.” ...|$|E

2500|$|According to a 1998 {{article in}} the Auburn Plainsman, the most likely origin of the [...] "War Eagle" [...] cry grew from a 1913 pep rally at Langdon Hall, where {{students}} had gathered {{the day before the}} annual football game against the University of Georgia. [...] Cheerleader Gus Graydon told the crowd, [...] "If we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> this game, we'll have {{to get out there and}} fight, because this means war." [...] During the frenzy, another student, E. T. Enslen, dressed in his military uniform, noticed something had dropped from his hat. [...] Bending down, he saw it was the metal emblem of an eagle that had come loose during his wild cheering. [...] Someone asked him what he had found, and Enslen loudly replied, [...] "It's a War Eagle!" [...] The new cry was used by students at the game the following day.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the fourth}} day, Robert Croft and Darren Thomas held Warwickshire briefly at bay with a {{partnership}} of 75, but this wasn't enough as Glamorgan succumbed for 323. Warwickshire captain, Nick Knight, said, [...] "Once they were bowled out for 198 on that pitch {{they were always}} going to struggle. They then put down three catches, which proved to be decisive. We {{had a bit of}} luck so {{we are not going to}} start going around saying that we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the Championship just because we have won one match." [...] John Derrick, Glamorgan's coach, said, [...] "Although we batted much better second time around, we made it difficult for ourselves by not scoring enough first innings runs. Warwickshire showed what playing pressure cricket is all about. They bowled with a lot of discipline. They piled up a big score to make sure that we did not get back into the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|United's {{progression}} in the Champions League was promising {{compared to}} previous seasons. The team eliminated Inter Milan at the quarter-final stage and faced Juventus {{in the last}} four of the competition. A late goal scored by Giggs in the first leg earned the team a 1–1 draw, but in spite of conceding an away goal, Ferguson was adamant of United's chances of reaching the final: [...] "...something tells me we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win.</b> The nature of our club is that we torture ourselves so much {{that the only way to}} get relief is by winning over there." [...] At the Stadio delle Alpi, striker Filippo Inzaghi scored twice to put Juventus 3–1 up on aggregate. Keane headed in a Beckham cross to halve the deficit just before half-time, but was later shown a yellow card for a foul on Edgar Davids, which prevented him from playing in the final. Yorke equalised, before Cole added a third to win the match outright. Keane's performance merited praise from Ferguson: ...|$|E

2500|$|For many reasons, Waltrip {{was unable}} to carry his success of the {{previous}} year into 1990. Waltrip failed to visit victory lane all season although he actually won a NASCAR Winston Cup race for which he is officially posted as finishing 2nd. The win came April 22, 1990, in the First Union 400, at North Wilkesboro Speedway in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina, in his final year with Hendrick Motorsports. 1990 was the first year since 1974, that Waltrip did not win a race. Brett Bodine was credited with the official victory, although NASCAR, and even Larry McReynolds, the crew chief at the time for Brett Bodine, later admitted to Waltrip, that Bodine did not actually win the race. Jeff Hammond, Waltrip's crew chief, appealed to NASCAR officials to correct what was clearly an error in NASCAR's scoring of the event. Waltrip even protested to NASCAR head Bill France, Jr.. Although France knew that a scoring error had been made, Bodine, had already been declared the race winner. According to Waltrip, France, told him to [...] "leave that boy alone, D.W., that's his first win and you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a lot more races." [...] The controversy {{was the result of a}} scoring error on the part of NASCAR when the pace car collected the wrong car after a caution flag. NASCAR spent 18 laps under caution attempting to determine the true race leader. This was before the current computerized timing and scoring technology that is now used. Bodine, who actually finished the race on the tail end of the lead lap, almost a full lap behind Waltrip, was officially credited with the win, the only victory of his career.|$|E

60|$|Of {{an evening}} {{there were more}} signs of life than {{at the time of}} my former residence.

Those who lave made bets scream and yell and jump frantically, if they think they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> or lose, but in a very few minutes it is all over; there is a hurrah from the winners, the owners seize their cocks, the winning bird is caressed and admired, the loser is generally dead or very badly wounded, and his master may often be seen plucking out his feathers as he walks away, preparing him for the cooking pot while the poor bird is still alive.|$|E
