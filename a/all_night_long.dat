5|$|Seymour and {{his small}} group of new {{followers}} soon relocated {{to the home of}} Richard and Ruth Asberry at 216 North Bonnie Brae Street. White families from local holiness churches began to attend as well. The group would get together regularly and pray to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. On April 9, 1906, after five weeks of Seymour's preaching and prayer, and three days into an intended 10-day fast, Edward S. Lee spoke in tongues for the first time. At the next meeting, Seymour shared Lee's testimony and preached a sermon on Acts 2:4 and soon six others began to speak in tongues as well, including Jennie Moore, who would later become Seymour's wife. A few days later, on April 12, Seymour spoke in tongues for the first time after praying <b>all</b> <b>night</b> <b>long.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{living in}} London, Mr Norrell {{encounters}} Vinculus, a street-magician, who relates a prophecy about a nameless slave and two magicians in England, but Norrell dismisses it. While travelling, Vinculus later meets Jonathan Strange, a young gentleman of property from Shropshire, and recites the same prophecy, which prompts Strange {{to become a}} magician. Meanwhile, the gentleman with thistle-down hair takes a liking to Stephen Black, Sir Walter's butler, and promises {{to make him a}} king. Emma (now Lady Pole) lapses into lassitude. She rarely speaks, and her attempts to communicate her situation are confounded by magic. Without the knowledge of the other characters, each evening she and Stephen are forced to attend balls held by the gentleman with thistle-down hair in the Faerie kingdom of Lost-Hope, where they dance <b>all</b> <b>night</b> <b>long.</b>|$|E
5|$|The song {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics, who praised Burke's vocal performance. It also received comparisons to songs by Bonnie Tyler, Beyoncé Knowles and Leona Lewis.

A year later when released as a promotional single, it peaked at number 16 on the chart. It peaked inside the top thirty on the singles charts in Hungary, Ireland and Scotland, and peaked at number 66 in Switzerland.

6000|$|Going {{out of the}} mouth, that is to say, {{deliberately}} and of purpose.

25|$|UGA {{students}} traditionally {{ring the}} school's Chapel Bell until midnight following any home football win. However, when UGA beats Tech, {{the bell rings}} <b>all</b> <b>night</b> <b>long.</b> Tech has a similar tradition with its whistle. UGA's Chapel Bell and Georgia Tech's Ramblin' Wreck have been rumored to have been stolen numerous times by their respective rival before, after, or even during major sporting events between the two schools. The bulldog statue in front of UGA's Memorial Hall was once stolen by Tech students. The culprits put the UGA and Tech police on a scavenger hunt to find the missing statue. Many fans of the respective institutions refuse to even partake in clothing, food, or other materials of their rival's school colors. Examples include Georgia fans refusing to eat mustard or Georgia Tech fans refusing to use red pens.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} deteriorated {{at about}} 3 AM, when 29-year-old African American Benoris Toney {{was shot in}} the head in the parking lot of the Dougherty Lumber Co. at 12100 Euclid Avenue.

Although the fairies say that they cannot stop Strephon, they have become strongly attracted to the peers ("In vain to us you plead"). The fairy Queen is dismayed by this.

25|$|Ewell, {{based on}} good {{intelligence}} from {{sources in the}} lower Valley, had foreseen that Milroy's only escape route could be successfully blocked and had already anticipated by having Rodes' Division advance on Martinsburg via Berryville to cut off Milroy's expected retreat route, per his plans from 11 June. That afternoon, having reached Berryville, Rodes' Division and Jenkins' cavalry brigade attempted to capture McReynolds' Brigade, but, alerted to the Confederate movement by the firing of signal guns by Milroy's main force in Winchester, McReynolds withdrew to Winchester, where his force occupied the Star Fort north of town. Nevertheless, the Confederates were able to capture portions of the Federal supply train at nearby Bunker Hill, West Virginia, along with 75 prisoners. Subsequently, Confederate forces cut the telegram line into Winchester, eliminating Milroy's only line of communication, and by sundown on 13 June Rodes' Division had reached Martinsburg, capturing the town along with five Federal artillery pieces. The night of 13 June a storm arose, and a strong rain drenched Winchester and the lower Valley <b>all</b> <b>night</b> <b>long.</b>|$|E
25|$|The III Cavalry Corps {{was first}} {{constituted}} for the French invasion of Russia and {{placed under the}} command of General of Division Emmanuel Grouchy. On 24 June 1812, corps numbered 9,676 men in 50 squadrons and was supported by 30 horse artillery pieces. There were three divisions under Generals of Division Louis Pierre Aimé Chastel, Jean-Pierre Doumerc, and Armand Lebrun de La Houssaye. Chastel led the 3rd Light Cavalry Division, Doumerc directed the 3rd Heavy Cavalry Division, and Houssaye commanded the 6th Heavy Cavalry Division. The Imperial French army captured Vilnius and Emperor Napoleon entered the city on 28 June. Four days later a freak storm with freezing rain blew <b>all</b> <b>night</b> <b>long,</b> causing the deaths of thousands of horses. Colonel Lubin Griois of Grouchy's corps artillery claimed that the storm killed one-fourth of his horses. Soon after, Grouchy was directed to place his cavalry under Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout in attempt to cut off General Pyotr Bagration's Russian Second Army. Though Davout reached Minsk ahead of Bagration, the Russian was able to slip out of the trap because King Jérôme Bonaparte failed to pursue with energy.|$|E
