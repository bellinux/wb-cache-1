50|$|<b>At</b> <b>Least</b> for <b>Now</b> is {{the debut}} studio album by English musician, singer, and poet Benjamin Clementine. It was {{recorded}} after Clementine gained critical acclaim {{with his two}} previous EPs. Clementine returned to London {{in the new year}} to record his album, just as his career was starting to take off. He moved to Kensington High Street with a friend he'd met in Tuscany then went back to Edmonton {{for a period of time}} until <b>At</b> <b>Least</b> for <b>Now</b> was completed.

60|$|Then she understood, nor did {{she ever}} seek to know any more. Whatever he had suffered, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>now</b> {{he was with the}} God he worshipped, and with the wife he lost.

When she {{appeared}} again she seemed to be herself in all things, only she never smiled and was very indifferent to what took place about her. Thus she remained for many days.|$|E
60|$|There {{was only}} one way out of the trouble, and now he blamed himself for not having tried to take that way at the outset. He had {{justified}} himself in shrinking from it by many plausible excuses, but he could justify himself no longer. He rejoiced in feeling compelled, as it were, to take it. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>now,</b> he should not be acting from any selfish impulse, and if there were anything unseemly in {{what he was going to}} do, he should have no regrets on that score, even in the shame of failure.|$|E

50|$|Clementine {{initially}} {{wanted to}} record his debut album, <b>At</b> <b>Least</b> for <b>Now</b> straight {{after his first}} EP, Cornerstone, but due to contractual dealings with the music industry and his label it was strategically held back for almost two years. During that time he decided to write his own dictionary, {{as well as a}} collection of poetry and classical music pieces. <b>At</b> <b>Least</b> for <b>Now</b> was mainly released across Europe on January 12, 2015. On the 13 February 2015 it reached the iTunes Top 10 in Italy, Holland, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg Poland and Greece. In France, it went number 1, has been certified Gold and has won a prestigious Victoires de la Musique (the French equivalent of the Grammys) award for best new artist.|$|R

60|$|Now, {{it seemed}} to him that the news he had heard had {{somewhat}} changed the position. He was no longer a penniless soldier. It was true that the Drummond estates were as nothing by the side of the broad lands owned by her father; but <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>now,</b> he was in the position of a Scottish gentleman of fair means and good standing, who could dispense with wealth on the part of a bride, and had a fair home and every comfort to offer to one in his native land. That he had, too, obtained the rank of colonel in the Prussian army, by service in many a desperate battle, distinctly added to his position. Thus, in every respect, the news that he had received was in the highest degree gratifying to him.|$|E
60|$|It is my {{wish that}} our acquaintance, or, {{if you please}} to accept it, friendship, may be permanent.

I have a thorough esteem for that independence of spirit [1] which you have maintained with sterling talent, and {{at the expense of}} some suffering. You have not, I trust, abandoned the poem you were composing, when Moore and I partook of your hospitality in the summer. I hope a time will come when he and I may be able to repay you in kind for the latter--for the rhyme, at least in quantity, you are in arrear to both.|$|E

But to be plain; there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust: wherefore, whatever others may say or profess, being beguiled by Satan, and their own hearts, yet do thou fear him that can [...] "destroy both soul and body in hell" [...] (Matt 10:28).|$|E
