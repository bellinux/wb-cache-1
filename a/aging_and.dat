Participants with different educational levels were studied to determine whether education affected their religious beliefs and influenced their perceptions of <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> dementia. Finally, a multiple regression analysis was performed to examine how each of these factors — <b>age,</b> religion, education, <b>and</b> ethnicity — affects individual perceptions of <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> dementia.|$|R

5|$|Amtrak {{took over}} {{operation}} of most intercity rail passenger {{service in the}} United States on May 1, 1971; up until then such services were run by various private railroads. The private railroads chose to retain their most modern passenger locomotives to operate the various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to Amtrak. To operate these intercity services the company had to buy or lease from the private railroads whatever locomotives remained. This left Amtrak with an <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives. The mainstays of Amtrak's road diesel fleet were veteran EMD E8s and EMD E9s, which were all 10–20 years old and due for replacement.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the role}} of {{mitochondria}} as the cell's powerhouse, {{there may be some}} leakage of the high-energy electrons in the respiratory chain to form reactive oxygen species. This was thought to result in significant oxidative stress in the mitochondria with high mutation rates of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Hypothesized links between <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> oxidative stress are not new and were proposed in 1956, which was later refined into the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging. A vicious cycle was thought to occur, as oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial DNA mutations, which can lead to enzymatic abnormalities and further oxidative stress.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to game, mutton was consumed {{from time to}} time. Keeping sheep provided wool to the household, and when a sheep reached an age when it was unsuitable for wool production, it could be harvested as mutton. Sheep were originally introduced to the Americas through the Spanish in Florida. In the north, the Dutch and English also introduced several varieties of sheep. The casual English practice of animal husbandry allowed sheep to roam free, consuming a variety of forage. Foragebased diets produce meat with a characteristically strong, gamey flavor and a tough consistency, which requires <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> slow cooking to tenderize.|$|E

Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{attitude}} of present middle-age generation to senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging.</b> The work {{is focused on the}} attitude character, i. e. whether it is positive, neutral or negative. The thesis is divided onto two parts. The first part deals with views and approaches of people to senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> in today?s society. The main aim of {{the first part of the}} work was to map the views and approaches to senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> occurring in the society. The second part is a research one and includes data analysis, and quantitative research among respondents in the issues of the approach to senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging.</b> The main aim of the second part of the work was to find the current view of the present middle-age generation to senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging.</b> The quantitative research was performed by the method of questioning by means of the standardized questionnaire technique examining the view of senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging.</b> The research shows that the middle-age generation views the senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> positively. It also shows that the differences in the views of senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> between the monitored middle-generation groups are not remarkable. In the discussion the author compares the results of her work with the views of other authors dealing with the same issue. She points out the areas of problems that occurred during the research. This thesis is contributory because it describes the character of the attitude of present middle-age society to the senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging.</b> The results may be beneficial for student involved in caring for people of this age group in their practical training and other activities.

5|$|The station depot was {{replaced}} by a wooden one-story depot, referred to by locals as a shack, {{along the side of the}} tracks in downtown Turner. The new station itself lasted around the same amount of time that its predecessor station depot had; however, the widow of Edward Henry Harriman (d. September 9, 1909), a local railroad executive whose Arden estate was in the nearby hills, donated land in February 1910 in a different portion of Turner to build a brand new station to the east.

5|$|Amtrak {{inherited}} an <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> mechanically-incompatible {{fleet of}} diesel locomotives from various private railroads on its startup in 1971. The most modern locomotives remained {{in private hands}} to operate the various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to Amtrak. To replace these Amtrak ordered 150 EMD SDP40F locomotives, which began entering service in 1973. These were supplemented by 25 GE P30CHs which entered service in 1975. The SDP40F was a troubled design; problems with weight distribution led {{to a series of}} derailments in the mid-1970s. Meanwhile, the poor truck design of the P30CH (and the electric GE E60CP) curtailed further orders of that unit when Amtrak found itself needing more short- and medium-distance power in the spring of 1975.|$|E

5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder of <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the Talbot Group was {{merged into}} Peugeot within PSA, and {{responsibility}} for the model was devolved to France. The Whitley design studio was dissolved, {{and some of the}} designers crossed over to British Leyland, where they joined their former boss Roy Axe. PSA had by then already started work on a replacement for the Samba, based on the Citroën AX, a few prototypes of which—essentially rebadged AXs—were created in 1983/84. The Samba sold reasonably well throughout 1982 and 1983, after which sales began to suffer, partly because of the model's <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> partly because of competition from the very popular Peugeot 205, which created powerful (and successful) internal competition within PSA for the little Talbot.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the U.S. {{trucking}} industry employed 1.8million {{drivers of}} heavy trucks. A {{major problem for}} the long-haul trucking industry is that {{a large percentage of}} these drivers are <b>aging,</b> <b>and</b> are expected to retire. Very few new hires are expected in the near future, resulting in a driver shortage. , within the long-haul sector, there is an estimated shortage of 20,000 drivers. That shortage was projected to increase to 111,000 by 2014, however the actual shortage of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38,000. The trucking industry (especially the long-haul sector) is also facing an image crisis due to the long working hours, long periods of time away from home, the dangerous nature of the work, and the average earnings compared to other forms of labor (such as construction, which was 1 percent higher than trucking in 2004).|$|E
