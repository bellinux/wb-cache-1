5|$|Patellar luxation, {{also known}} as luxating patella, is a {{hereditary}} disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> has happened. Dogs can {{have a problem with}} both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.|$|E

When {{everyone}} in the office finds out, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) worries that Michael will discover the party he is throwing that night, to which Michael is not invited. Inevitably, Michael notices and tries to get Jim to admit that he's having a party, while Jim acts nonchalantly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> is happening. In order to keep Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) from exposing the party, Jim tells him that it is a surprise party for Michael.|$|E

This fox would watch the world go by from its perch and was {{sufficiently}} savvy {{to leave the house}} keepers chickens alone. One day this fox encountered the local hunt and ran to cover in the tree, to the amazement and consternation of the hunters and hounds.

By 1975, {{the members of the}} band were ready to work with each other again, and they decided to reform the band. All the members were keen on {{carrying}} on with new music, with no nostalgia for their previous era, {{and did not want to}} play earlier stage favourites such as [...] "Killer" [...] (the opening track on H to He, Who Am the Only One) and [...] "Theme One".

Within two days of the assassination, Austria-Hungary and Germany advised Serbia that it should open an investigation, but Secretary General to the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Slavko Gruic, replied [...] "Nothing had been done so far and the matter did not concern the Serbian Government."

[...] He {{was a relatively}} small player, standing [...] tall, and weighing [...] [...] He was {{sometimes referred to as}} Michigan's [...] "mighty mite tailback." [...] In addition to his speed, what set him apart from other backs was his ability to cut and find the smallest of holes. [...] Bo Schembechler called Bell [...] "the greatest cutback runner I've ever coached." [...] In 1975, the Associated Press noted: [...] "Bell is noted for his ability to cut on a dime, spurt through miniscule [...] holes and hurdle tacklers. [...] He's got fine speed and he's durable. [...] Bell seems to get -- pardon the expression -- his bell rung on many tackles, only to bounce up <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> happened." [...] Noted Michigan radio broadcaster Bob Ufer often referred to Bell as [...] "little Gordie Bell." [...] Ufer once humorously said, referring to Bell's ability to shift directions quickly, that Bell [...] "could run fifteen minutes in a phone booth and never touch the sides." ...|$|E
500|$|Tokyo {{during the}} Meiji period (1868–1912) {{had a great}} {{openness}} to foreign—especially European—influence, and Western trends in art were quickly replacing traditional Japanese ones until word spread of the impact exported ukiyo-e had had on art in the West. [...] Artists who had all but abandoned {{the culture of the}} Edo period began to reconsider it and mix elements of it with Western approaches. [...] Kanae took part in meetings of the Pan no Kai group of writers and artists whose goal was to replicate the atmosphere of Parisian cafés such as Café Guerbois of the Impressionists. [...] At one of these rowdy bohemian meetings, a drunken Kanae fell through a window and landed in the garden below, wrapped in a [...] paper screen; he returned to the gathering <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened. [...] The police kept watch over these meetings whose members they suspected of having socialist sympathies and held grudges over caricatures some of the members had published. [...] Pan no Kai waned and came to and end in 1911.|$|E

500|$|Kahn {{proposed}} a structure within a structure, monumental [...] "pylons of Jerusalem stone {{on each side}} enclosing four huge central pillars of reinforced concrete, so that the pylons function as a container and the pillars as its content". Following the Beaux-Arts tradition, the elements of architecture were conceived as hollow, thus creating pocketing spaces within both structures. The outer structure was composed of 16 piers covered in golden Jerusalem stone cut in blocks of the same proportions and same course finish {{as those of the}} Western Wall. In the bases of the four corners of the two-story, [...] high structure delineated by the piers, there would be small alcoves for meditation or individual prayer. Such alcoves would be used for daily prayer services, allowing larger crowds on Sabbath or festivals. Boston-based architect Moshe Safdie, who had built extensively in Jerusalem and trained with Kahn in Philadelphia, was also in favour of rebuilding using contemporary design: [...] "It's absurd to reconstruct the Hurva <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened. If we have the desire to rebuild it, let's have the courage to have a great architect do it." ...|$|E

Some fans were also upset with the decision to carry on with the show. One man, who left the event with his children upon hearing that Hart had died, claimed, [...] "It was disgusting.... For kids to see that, {{for this to be}} so-called family entertainment, for them to just carry on <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened, is just sad." [...] Martha Hart, Owen's wife, refused to criticize McMahon publicly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} her husband's death. She said that McMahon [...] "absolutely should be there" [...] at the funeral. She also stated, [...] "I'm a very forgiving person and I'm not bitter or angry, but there will be a day of reckoning". Commenting on the WWF's decision {{to continue the}} show after her husband's death, Martha stated, [...] "After he lost his fight for life they just scooped him up and ordered the next match out. Where's the humanity? Would he have wanted the show to go on? Absolutely not." ...|$|E
500|$|Nosanchuk {{gave his}} final {{statement}} to the court first. Speaking for the defence, he reminded the jury {{that every one of}} the doctors speaking on Lamb's behalf had originally been engaged by the state and that Yaworsky was the only one not employed in the public sector. He conceded that the defendant's actions were senseless and violent, but stressed that if found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, Lamb would stay in custody and could be kept in psychiatric care for the rest of his life if necessary. He argued that Lamb's actions on the evening of 25 June 1966 clearly made no sense and asked the jury to carefully consider them: the victims were not known to Lamb; Lamb made no attempt to disguise himself; Lamb acted alone; Lamb had nothing to gain from the act; Lamb inexplicably diverted his fire from the original group to a shadow in a doorway; Lamb then chose another house at random and threatened to kill the occupant, then left without doing anything; Lamb made no attempt to hide the weapon, leaving it in a nearby field where it would surely be found; then, finally, the boy simply went home to bed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened. Was this, Nosanchuk asked, the behaviour of a premeditated killer, or of a profoundly disturbed young man who did not appreciate what he was doing? ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Revenge" [...] {{was written}} by series co-creator Larry David and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. All prior Seinfeld episodes were co-written by Seinfeld and David. The Revenge is the first episode written by David alone, though Seinfeld did proofread the script and would {{continue to do so}} for all scripts up to the eighth season. George's storyline in the episode is based on David's own experiences while a writer at Saturday Night Live. David had quit SNL halfway through the 1984-1985 television season, but felt he had made a mistake once he reached his home. His neighbor Kenny Kramer, who later served as the main inspiration for Kramer, suggested David return to work the following Monday and act <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened. Unlike George Costanza, the ploy succeeded for David, who remained with SNLs writing staff until the end of that season. George's reason for quitting was inspired by Seinfeld writer Larry Charles' use of the private restroom in Seinfeld and David's office instead of the public one. The Newman sub plot was inspired by one of David's neighbors, who once jumped from {{the second floor of the}} apartment building in which they both lived. The unseen character Mr. Papanickolas, who is mentioned by Kramer, was named after Pete Papanickolas, a member of the production crew.|$|E
500|$|Cardigan's {{commanding}} officer and brother-in-law, Lord Lucan, had been recalled in disgrace—largely {{brought about by}} the determination of the commander-in-chief, Lord Raglan, to displace blame from himself— and arrived in England only two weeks after his subordinate but, as the officer who had [...] "looked on" [...] (a pun on his name much exploited by Cardigan) while the charge had taken place, little regard was given to his version of events. (Lucan had earned the unfortunate nickname of [...] "Lord Look-on" [...] while held in reserve during an action before the earlier Battle of Alma.) In July 1855, The Times hinted that the public had been misled over [...] "the real nature of [...] services in the East" [...] but, in the absence of anything definitive, his popularity remained. However, officers who had taken command {{in the aftermath of the}} charge, the role that Cardigan was claiming for himself, had heard of his reception in England and were anxious to put the record straight. The writer George Ryan, who had rushed out a hasty pamphlet praising Cardigan, retracted his words, and was the first to report Cardigan's fellow officers' reservations about the earl's conduct on the day. As the soldiers themselves began to return to England, the doubts hardened. It was not until the following year, however, with the official enquiries of Colonel Tulloch and the publication of Calthorpe's Letters, was there proof that Cardigan had not been telling the truth. Nonetheless he continued, with characteristic arrogance and self-delusion, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> was amiss and he remained in his cavalry post for the next five years. Eight months on active service, or, A diary of a general officer of cavalry, in 1854, published in 1855, was Cardigan's own account of his time in the Crimea.|$|E
500|$|Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{said that}} the scene where Santana comes out to her {{grandmother}} only to be rejected was a [...] "powerful moment and Rivera delivered in a way equal to Chris Colfer and Mike O'Malley's scenes during Kurt's coming out". Bell also complimented the sequence, though she criticized the next scene for showing [...] "a happy, smiling Santana" [...] with no further explanation, and Canning and Kubicek were also unhappy with her abrupt change in mood, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened. VanDerWerff, though he called the coming-out scene [...] "a moment that's played {{with a sort of}} bracing honesty and moving empathy" [...] for what Santana was going through, stated that the [...] "Santana storyline {{has been one of the}} best things about the back half of season two and this front half of season three, and the scenes that should be its emotional crux are occurring in our imaginations", such as when she comes out to her parents. Goldberg called the fact that Finn suffered no consequences for his outing of Santana [...] "a missed opportunity". Bell, however, thought that his telling Santana that [...] "he cares about her and doesn't want her to hold her feelings for women in anymore" [...] was [...] "one of the most touching scenes of the series", though Kubicek characterized Finn's statement that he cared for her because Santana [...] "was his first" [...] as creepy. MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan derided the choice to perform [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] as [...] "poor comprehension of song lyrics", since Santana [...] "is a lesbian and not just [...] drunk girl who kissed another girl after drinking". VanDerWerff wondered why Santana was so happy during the song, since she had just experienced [...] "the sort of outrageous bigotry she'll have to put up with for the rest of her life".|$|E
