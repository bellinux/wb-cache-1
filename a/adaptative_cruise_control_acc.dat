The main challenge is to perceive the environment, especialy at low speed. In this paper, we present a novel approach to track the 3 -D trajectory and speed of the obstacles and the surrounding vehicles through a stereo-vision system. This tracking method extends the classical patch-based Lucas-Kanade algorithm [9], [1] by integrating the geometric constraints of the stereo system into the motion model: the epipolar constraint, which enforces the tracked patches to remain on the epipolar lines, and the magnification constraint, which links the disparity of the tracked patches to the apparent size of these patches. We report experimental results on simulated and real data showing the improvement in accuracy and robustness of our algorithm compared to the classical Lucas-Kanade tracker...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis brief {{deals with}} the design and experimen-tal {{application}} of a hybrid fractional adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> (<b>ACC)</b> at low speeds. First, an improved fractional-order <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> (CC) is presented for a commercial Citroën C 3 prototype—which has automatic driving capabilities—at low speeds, which considers a hybrid model of the vehicle. The quadratic stability {{of the system is}} proved using a frequency domain method. Second, ACC maneuvers are implemented with two different distance policies using two cooperating vehicles— one manual, the leader, and the other, automatic—also at very low speeds. In these maneuvers, the objective is to maintain a desired interdistance between the leader and follower vehi-cles, i. e., to perform a distance control—with a proportional differential (PD) controller in this case—in which the previously designed fractional-order CC is used for the speed control. Simulation and experimental results, obtained in a real circuit, are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.

40|$|Research on {{adaptive}} <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> (<b>ACC)</b> {{is presently}} {{one of the}} most important topics in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems. The main feature of such controllers is that there is adaptation to a user-preset speed and, if necessary, speed reduction to keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead in the same lane of the road. Adaptive <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> (<b>ACC)</b> operates in Velocity control mode and Distance <b>control</b> mode. <b>ACC</b> acts like a conventional Cruise Controller in the case of velocity control mode.

40|$|It {{has been}} posited that Adaptive <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> (<b>ACC)</b> {{represents}} {{a new generation}} of vehicle automation, in that {{it has the potential to}} relieve drivers of mental as well as physical workload. The results of previous research however, have raised some confusing issues about the specific effects of Adaptive <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> (<b>ACC)</b> on driver mental workload (MWL) [...] some studies report reduced MWL compared to manual driving, while others find no effect. Two hypotheses are proposed in an attempt to explain these discrepancies: (a) that any potential MWL reductions due to ACC could be masked by the overriding influence of steering demand; or (b) that the tasks designed in some experiments do not exploit the adaptive nature of the ACC system, therefore precluding any potential benefits. Two related experiments were designed to test these hypotheses. It was found that the main reason for the discrepant findings was the nature of the driving task chosen [...] constant-speed tasks do not realise the mental workload benefits of ACC. Future researchers using ACC devices are advised to use variable-speed tasks to ensure that all aspects of device functionality are covered...|$|R
