As the illustration suggests, the torque does not change (the same lever arm) if the <b>application</b> <b>point</b> is moved along the line of the application of the force (dotted black line).

MethodsComputer retrieved CNKI, VIP, CBM and other databanks and manual operations retrieved correlative literatures to find randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about comparison between <b>point</b> <b>application</b> or adjuvant therapy and no-point-applications {{for treatment of}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in stationary phase in China. RevMan 5. 0 software was used for Meta analysis. ResultsAmong 3481 cases in the inclusive 32 RCTS, 1780 cases were in the test group and 1701 cases in the control group. Meta analysis indicated: 1) clinical efficacy: the groups containing <b>point</b> <b>application</b> therapy all were better than the groups of no-point-application; 2) force vital capacity (FVC) : There was no statistically significant difference between the group of <b>point</b> <b>application</b> plus Western Medicine and the Western Medicine group; 3) force expiratory volume 1 (FEV 1) : The groups containing <b>point</b> <b>application</b> therapy were better than the no-point-application; 4) FEV 1 %: the groups of <b>point</b> <b>application</b> plus Western Medicine were better than the Western Medicine groups; 5) FEV 1 /FVC: {{there was a significant difference}} between the group of <b>point</b> <b>application</b> plus Chinese drugs and the group of Chinese drug.
