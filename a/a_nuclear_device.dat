5|$|The {{signing of}} the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963 and the Outer Space Treaty in 1967 {{prevented}} future exploration {{of the concept of}} detonating <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>device</b> on the Moon. By this time both the United States and the Soviet Union had performed several high-altitude nuclear explosions, including those of Operation Hardtack I, Operation Argus, Operation Dominic I and II, and The K Project.|$|E

They agree to join after Douchebag infiltrates an {{abortion}} clinic and travels across Canada to discover which of their friends is spreading gossip. Flanked by the girls, kindergarten pirates, and Star Trek role-players, the humans and elves attack Clyde's dark tower. Randy arrives and reveals that the government agents have planted <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>device</b> in Mr. Slave's anus to blow up South Park, forcing Douchebag to shrink and enter Mr. Slave to disarm the bomb. After exiting Mr. Slave, Douchebag finally confronts Clyde and is forced to fight a resurrected Nazi Zombie Chef; Chef is defeated. Clyde decides he is not playing any more and Cartman kicks him from the tower.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{mathematician}} Stanislaw Ulam, {{his wife}} Francoise Ulam, who performed the calculations, and their collaborator, Cornelius Everett, {{worked on the}} Super design through 1949. There was no push from the military for the weapon, because the AEC regarded it as too secret to inform either its own Military Liaison Committee or the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project about it. In September 1949, the Soviet Union detonated <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>device.</b> It fell to Oppenheimer, {{as chairman of the}} AEC General Advisory Committee (GAC), to decide whether the United States should develop the Super in response. The Super design used large quantities of tritium, which could only be manufactured in a reactor, and therefore at the expense of plutonium production for smaller weapons, so the GAC advised against it. Nonetheless, Truman approved the Super on January 31, 1950. Because of the secrecy surrounding the decision, accounts published in the 1950s incorrectly portrayed Oppenheimer as obstructing its development on political grounds, and this was a factor in the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant was}} {{completed}} in 1981 and cold reprocessing tests for producing plutonium took place at New Labs in 1986. The New Labs came into limelight when Pakistan had secretly tested its plutonium weapon-based <b>nuclear</b> <b>device</b> in Kirana Hills. On 30 May 1999, the PAEC scientists, under renowned nuclear physicist Dr. Samar Mubarakmand, had tested <b>a</b> miniaturised <b>nuclear</b> <b>device</b> that {{is believed to be}} a Plutonium devices for which plutonium was most likely reprocessed by the Pakistani scientists into weapon-grade at the New Labs. The test yield of <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>devices</b> was reported to be 12-40 kt.|$|R

Although, PAEC did not use weapon grade {{plutonium}} or uranium in their test, KRL's cold test was different in this regard.|$|R

25|$|The {{suspicion}} intensified in {{the second}} half of the 1980s. As domestic media reports were published, uncovering secret nuclear developments, rumors about a possible Brazilian nuclear test emerged. One of the main Brazilian newspapers, Folha de S. Paulo, published an interview in April 1985 with a retired military officer who stated that the government planned to develop <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>device</b> and explode it in 1990. During that same period, international papers denounced covert nuclear activities in Brazil, which reignited external questioning of its nuclear aspirations.|$|E

25|$|India's {{relationship}} with Pakistan remained strained following the Shimla Accord in 1972. Gandhi's authorization of the detonation of <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>device</b> at Pokhran in 1974 was viewed by Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto {{as an attempt}} to intimidate Pakistan into accepting India's hegemony in the subcontinent. However, in May 1976, Gandhi and Bhutto both agreed to reopen diplomatic establishments and normalize relations. Following the rise to power of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in Pakistan in 1978, India's relations with its neighbour reached a nadir. Gandhi accused General Zia of supporting Khalistani militants in Punjab. Military hostilities recommenced in 1984 following Gandhi's authorization of Operation Meghdoot. India was victorious in the resulting Siachen conflict against Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|However, after India tested <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>device</b> in 1974, the U.S. {{slowed down}} and {{eventually}} halted nuclear cooperation with Brazil. Also, {{in the aftermath}} of the 1973 energy crisis, USAEC made its provision of fuel to third countries subject to availability. This in turn pushed Brazil to accelerate talks with West Germany and France, eventually signing an agreement with the former on 27 June 1975, that established the transfer of operational know-how regarding reactors. The deal represented the largest technology transfer agreement ever signed between an industrialized country and an industrializing one. Bonn committed to export four to eight reactors over a span of 15 years. Likewise, West German firms agreed to construct a complete nuclear fuel cycle in Brazil: uranium prospecting and mining; uranium enrichment (using the jet-nozzle process); manufacturing fuel rods; and reprocessing spent fuel rods. For West Germany’s nuclear industry, this was the most significant contract ever to be established, at an anticipated value of 10 billion marks (roughly US$4 billion). Also, this was the largest single export order in German history.|$|E

500|$|The Vixen minor trials (Vixen A and Vixen B) were {{formulated}} {{to investigate}} {{what would happen}} to <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>device</b> which burnt or was subject to a non-nuclear explosion. 31 Vixen A trials between 1959 and 1961 investigated the effects of an accidental fire on a nuclear weapon, and involved a total of about 1kg of plutonium. Twelve Vixen B trials, between 1960 and 1963, attempted to discover the effects of high explosives detonating a nuclear weapon in a fire (typical of conditions which would occur in aviation accidents) and involved 22kg of plutonium. They produced [...] "jets of molten, burning plutonium extending hundreds of feet into the air." [...] It was the lack of subsequent disposal of the plutonium from these minor trials – Vixen B especially – which created the major radiation problems at the site.|$|E
500|$|Harry Horse {{conceived}} the game's ancient planetwide conspiracy. Horse had previously written several children's books {{and received the}} Scottish Arts Council Writer of the Year award for his 1983 book [...] He began forging documents that same year {{as a way to}} earn money. The story which became the basis for Drowned God was originally a phony manuscript Horse wrote in 1983, ostensibly describing events after the destruction of the lost city of Atlantis. The manuscript, dated 1846, was said to have been written by the English poet Richard Horne, who shares Horse's birth name. Horse's initiation into the concept of an alternate history came in the early 1980s, when he first encountered professor Ian Halpke, who explained to him that information from the Kabbalah and ancient Jewish texts [...] "hide and encipher the secret", namely, human evolution was aided by extraterrestrial intelligence.

The movie received generally favorable reviews, {{but it did not}} fare particularly well at the box office. The following year, he collaborated with LaBute in a film adaptation of the Man Booker Prize-winning novel Possession (2002). In 2003, Eckhart co-starred with Hilary Swank in The Core, a film about a geophysicist who tries to detonate <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>device</b> in order to save the world from destruction. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. Also in 2003, he appeared in The Missing, in which he played Cate Blanchett's lover, and in the action-thriller Paycheck opposite Ben Affleck. Paycheck, based on a short story by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, garnered generally negative reception. Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars (out of four), saying that he [...] "enjoyed the movie" [...] but felt that it [...] "exploits [...] for its action and plot potential, but never really develops it." ...|$|E

Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to [...] "a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula", and stated that [...] "transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities {{would be considered a}} grave threat to the United States", for which North Korea would be held accountable. On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account.
