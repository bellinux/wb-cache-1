30|$|We {{put forward}} a L 0 {{gradient}} minimization guided image filter for random-noise removal. It consists of two operation steps: First, to smooth <b>a</b> <b>noised</b> stele image by using L 0 gradient minimization technique.

40|$|International audienceThis {{experiment}} {{tested the}} advantage of binaural presentation of <b>an</b> interfering <b>noise</b> in <b>a</b> task involving identification of monaurally-presented words. These words were embedded in three types of noise: <b>a</b> stationary <b>noise,</b> <b>a</b> speech-modulated <b>noise</b> and <b>a</b> speech-babble <b>noise,</b> {{in order to assess}} energetic and informational masking contributions to binaural unmasking. Our results showed important informational masking in the monaural condition, principally due to lexical and phonetic competition. We also found a binaural unmasking effect, which was more important when speech was used as interferer, suggesting that this suppressive effect was more efficient in the case of high-level informational (lexical and phonetic) competition...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{algorithm}} to reduce <b>an</b> impact <b>noise</b> was developed using <b>an</b> active <b>noise</b> control(ANC). When the impact sound {{with a large}} magnitude in an instant was used in a conventional ANC, the convergence performance was degraded {{and it is not}} possible to ensure stability. The reference signal was accurately calculated using Prony’s method that was considered to damping coefficient of the impact <b>noise.</b> <b>A</b> floor <b>noise</b> generated by standard heavy impact source was reduced at the error microphone...|$|R

Due to the room not having a telephone or an inside door handle, they cannot escape, and Peter begins to tell stories {{about the history of the}} Griffin family.|$|E
5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} hearing and can detect an extremely {{broad range of}} frequencies. They can hear higher-pitched sounds than either dogs or humans, detecting frequencies from 55Hz to 79,000Hz, a range of 10.5octaves, while humans and dogs both have ranges of about 9octaves. Cats can hear ultrasound, which is important in hunting because many species of rodents make ultrasonic calls. However, they do not communicate using ultrasound like rodents do. Cats' hearing is also sensitive and among the best of any mammal, being most acute {{in the range of}} 500Hz to 32kHz. This sensitivity is further enhanced by the cat's large movable outer ears (their pinnae), which both amplify sounds and help detect the direction of <b>a</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gertrude summons Hamlet to {{her room}} to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has {{possession}} of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. Hamlet, {{on his way to}} visit his mother, sneaks up behind him, but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a tapestry, makes <b>a</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|E

5|$|In some circumstances, {{the conduct}} of the {{defendant}} can be a factor in determining the unreasonableness of their interference. In this situation the motives of the defendant and the reasonableness of their conduct are the factors used to determine the unreasonableness of their actions. This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, the defendant was deliberately creating <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens {{played the}} Chicago Black Hawks in Montreal on January 28, 1937. In the first period, Morenz {{went after the}} puck in the Chicago end while being chased by Black Hawks defenceman Earl Seibert. Morenz lost his balance {{and fell to the}} ice, {{crashing}} into the boards and catching his left skate in the wooden siding. Seibert, unable to stop, landed on him with full force. The resulting impact snapped Morenz's left leg, creating <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> heard throughout the rink. Helped to the Canadiens bench by his teammates, Morenz was taken to Hôpital St-Luc, where it was found that his leg was fractured in four places.|$|E
5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice out of the tub in which our drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came over the side of the gutter, crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass. Those English eyes certainly did stand out.|$|E
30|$|In addition, we {{examined}} <b>a</b> pink <b>noise</b> as <b>a</b> representative colored <b>noise.</b> Other steady noises {{can be reduced}} {{in the same manner}} if the outline of the power spectrum is known. However, it appears that we must incorporate new methods other than the proposed method, and the new methods must be dynamically devised because the characteristic of <b>an</b> unsteady <b>noise</b> must be predicted.|$|R

On 8 April Channel4 News {{released}} their own footage, which showed the officer's arm swing back to head height before bringing it down to hit Tomlinson on the legs with the baton. Another video obtained by The Guardian on 21 April shows Tomlinson standing by a bicycle rack, hands in his pockets, when the police approach him. After he is hit, he can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side}} of his forehead; eyewitnesses spoke of hearing <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> as his head hit the ground.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens in}} Paris, {{a day before}} the {{original}} game's start, with journalist Nicole Collard receiving a request {{to go to the}} Palais Royale, to interview a famous media tycoon and potential candidate for President of France, Pierre Carchon. A mime hangs around outside Carchon's home, but Nico ignores him and goes on inside the house. She meets Carchon's wife, Imelda, as well as Carchon, who reveals that he knew Nico's father, Thierry Collard, very well. Soon, there is <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> in the drawing room; Carchon investigates only to be shot. Nico rushes to the scene to see the mime over Pierre's corpse. She is knocked to the ground before she can do anything and wakes up to find Imelda going to call the police.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{responding}} to a public disturbance call, Tre, a Bloods gang member, yells racial insults at Zavala, who responds by accepting a one-on-one fist fight. Zavala beats and arrests him, but wins Tre's respect for not charging him with assault.

5|$|Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians or VSP is a Nissan-developed warning {{sound system}} in {{electric}} vehicles. The Nissan Leaf {{was the first}} car manufactured by Nissan to include VSP, and the electric car includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse. The VSP was also used in the Nissan Fuga hybrid launched in 2011. The system developed makes <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> easy to hear for those outside {{to be aware of}} the vehicle approaching, but the warning sounds do not distract the car occupants inside. Nissan explained that during the development of the sound they studied behavioral research of the visually impaired and worked with cognitive and acoustic psychologists, including the National Federation of the Blind, the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, experts from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a Hollywood sound design studio.|$|E
5|$|Doggett {{goes off}} alone {{to see the}} woman who guarded the {{creature}} in the woods. The woman implies that Mulder, feeling sorry for the creature, was trying to euthanize the creature, not save Hangemuhl. Doggett hears <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> and finds a trap door leading into the tunnels. Underground, he finds Hangemuhl and takes her to the hospital. Skinner checks in with Doggett who reports that Hangemuhl's kidneys have healed spontaneously. Doggett returns to {{the woman in the}} woods who watches over the creature; after recoiling at its ugliness, the woman explains that it looks the way it does because it takes the sickness of others into itself, while healing them in the process. Doggett decides to take the creature away from the society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater. She weeps over it, revealing that, by eating Doggett's death, it has finally been allowed to die.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park allows boating on all {{the lakes}} in Jackson Hole, but {{motorized}} boats can only be used on Jackson and Jenny Lakes. While there is no maximum horsepower limit on Jackson Lake (though there is <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> restriction), Jenny Lake is restricted to 10horsepower. Only non-motorized boats are permitted on Bearpaw, Bradley, Emma Matilda, Leigh, Phelps, String, Taggart and Two Ocean Lakes. There are four designated boat launches located on Jackson Lake and one on Jenny Lake. Additionally, sailboats, windsurfers and water skiing are only allowed on Jackson Lake and no jet skis are permitted {{on any of the}} park waterways. All boats are required to comply with various safety regulations including personal flotation devices for each passenger. Only non-motorized watercraft are permitted on the Snake River. All other waterways in the park are off limits to boating, and this includes all alpine lakes and tributary streams of the Snake River.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} a mathematical theory of handling {{and working with}} wide band noises. We demonstrate that <b>a</b> wide band <b>noise</b> can be represented as a distributed delay of <b>a</b> white <b>noise.</b> Based on this we deduce that the behavior of <b>a</b> wide band <b>noise</b> is same as the behavior of an infinite dimensional colored noise along the boundary line. All these are used to deduce {{a complete set of}} formulae for the Kalman type optimal filter for <b>a</b> wide band <b>noise</b> driven linear systems...|$|R
50|$|In radio {{communication}} and electronics, {{this may include}} thermal noise, black body, cosmic noise as well as atmospheric noise from distant thunderstorms and similar and any other unwanted man-made signals, {{sometimes referred to as}} incidental noise.
