40|$|Proceedings of the 2003 Georgia Water Resources Conference, held April 23 - 24, 2003, at the University of Georgia. The {{focus of}} urban {{hydrology}} {{has traditionally been}} upon flood-event runoff and the management of storm water. However, the impervious cover that {{is an element of}} urbanization can also cause diminished soil moisture levels and lower base flows due to less recharge to <b>a</b> <b>watershed’s</b> near-surface groundwater system. Presented here is a modeling approach for examining urbanization-related changes in soil moisture levels. This approach employs a TOPMODEL-like topographic index that is implemented using <b>a</b> spatially distributed <b>watershed</b> representation within <b>a</b> geographic information system. Using the model, the changes resulting from urban development upon the extent of the saturation zone in a small, north Georgia watershed are simulated.

5|$|Although the {{rebellion}} did not itself achieve lasting success, {{it is commonly}} cited as <b>a</b> <b>watershed</b> moment in Nyasaland history. The rebellion had lasting effects on the British system of administration in Nyasaland and some reform was enacted in its aftermath. After World War II, the growing Malawian nationalist movement reignited interest in the Chilembwe revolt, and after the independence of Malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key moment in the nation's history. Chilembwe's memory, which remains prominent in the collective national consciousness, has often been invoked in symbolism and rhetoric by Malawian politicians. Today, the uprising is celebrated annually and Chilembwe himself is considered a national hero.|$|E

He altered his tactics and built a stubborn team, which lacked the creativity associated with {{the first half of}} his Arsenal reign. Graham's Arsenal struggled to put together a title challenge in the newly-formed Premier League, but were cup specialists in the early half of the nineties. In 1992–93, Graham became the first manager to win the FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. A season later, he guided Arsenal to their first European trophy for almost a quarter of a century, as the team won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E

Gaps in knowledge of such are filled by educated assumptions, until more specific data accumulates.|$|R

Major components of the study involved the accurate modeling of the hydrology of <b>an</b> agricultural <b>watershed,</b> the enhancement of the presentation of simulated hydrology results to decision-makers, and the exploration of alternative management options in <b>an</b> agricultural <b>watershed.</b> The objectives {{of this study were}} to: (1) evaluate the performance of a distributed-parameter hydrologic model to simulate daily runoff of <b>an</b> agricultural <b>watershed,</b> (2) visualize the simulation results generated by the model from observed data, and (3) use the visualization procedures developed to examine scenarios of impacts of alternative land management practices on the streamflow from <b>an</b> agricultural <b>watershed.</b> Geographic information systems (GIS) techniques were used to prepare input data for the Precipitation and Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) to simulate surface hydrology of <b>an</b> agricultural <b>watershed.</b> Results from the simulation were then used as input for a dynamic visualization process.
