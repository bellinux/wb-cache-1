Tobey Maguire's {{just a boy}} in tights," [...] He also added, [...] "You want Tom Cruise <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> can get is Jude Law? Wait. You want Russell Crowe <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> can get is Colin Farrell? Wait. Alexander is not Gladiator." [...] In response, Sean Penn rebutted Rock's remarks praising Law {{as one of his}} generation's [...] "finest actors". Over a year later, Law {{expressed}} his anger toward Rock in The New York Times telling columnist Craig Modderno, [...] "At first I laughed because I didn't think he knew who I was. Then I got angry as his remarks became personal. My friends were livid. It's unfortunate I had five or six films come out at the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|Williams felt music lacked energy, citing Limp Bizkit's [...] "Nookie" [...] as {{the last}} {{energetic}} record. Williams suggested his engineer, Andrew Coleman, to [...] "put the drums and bass on the right, keys in the middle, and the mothafucking guitar and backgrounds on the left". Coleman denied his request, saying, [...] "those systems were different back then. If we do that, you'll be in a club <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> will hear {{on one side of}} the club is drums and on the other side, just chords." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Joseph, {{in review}} of Thriller 25 for PopMatters, {{described}} the track {{listing of the}} reissue as [...] "pleasant" [...] but West's [...] "lazy" [...] remix was the only exception. He added, [...] "You've been {{given the opportunity to}} remix the most iconic single from one of the most iconic albums of all time, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> can do is stick a drum machine on top of the song's original arrangement?". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone disliked the removal of the original bassline, and compared it to [...] "putting Bobby Orr on the ice without a hockey stick". IGN's Todd Gilchrist praised West's remix and stated that it was a [...] "pretty great track". He added, [...] "it almost overplays the track's originally understated drama, his additions enhance the song and demonstrate that in a contemporary context." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{said that}} while {{producing}} the song, they attempted to find out [...] "how to make dance music" [...] without turning themselves into a dance act. Armstrong {{said it was the}} first time the band had written a dance song. Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound compared the song with the works of The Rapture and The Clash's 1982 album, Combat Rock; he said it was [...] "strictly for basement dancefloors everywhere". According to Armstrong, the lyrics of [...] "Kill the DJ" [...] can be considered as [...] "a sweeping political statement" [...] rather than being interpreted as [...] "a comment on electronic music figures". He told Rolling Stone the song is about [...] "static and noise...Like this government cannot, will not, agree with itself. They refuse to make it work. Right, left—it doesn’t matter. It blows your mind and pisses you off. It’s a song about being drunk, going through this chaos, feeling fucked up <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> want to do is get more drunk".|$|E
500|$|When Stephen King {{created the}} {{character}} of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is [...] "somebody who’s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [...] tremendously attractive {{to men and women}} both, and [...] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a [...] "gigantic evil", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, [...] "I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s—he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they're all basically the same guy". Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan, this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: [...] "I know all the things that you want and I can give them to you <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> have to do is give me your soul".|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 NHL season, Panthers head coach Peter DeBoer, who first saw Horton play at seven years old, said about his hopes for Horton, [...] "If I'm looking for guys to do more, he wouldn't be at the top of the list. If he can give us 30-plus, I'd be happy with Nathan. There's a group of guys {{underneath}} him that I think can make a lot bigger jumps than I need out of Nathan Horton goal-wise." [...] Horton was also moved from his position of right wing to centre before the season. After playing a few games at centre, Horton said, [...] "It's not as easy as wing. You can play wing <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> have to concentrate on is getting the puck and shooting it. At center, you have more responsibilities." [...] Against the Nashville Predators on November 1, Horton played in his 300th career game, but failed to record a point. On November 26, Horton suffered a deep cut in his leg after it was stepped on by a skate. At the time of the injury, Horton had 6 goals and 7 assists. In early December, the Ottawa Sun reported that the Panthers might have been looking to trade Horton after he was reportedly unhappy playing for the team. Horton returned to the lineup on December 17 after missing eight games. After the game, Horton commented, [...] "I'm excited to play. It's kind of a different Panthers team than the past. It's really changed in a matter of a month. Things are going good now, and everybody's really buying into what Pete has been telling us all year." [...] On January 17, Horton recorded 3 assists to help the Panthers defeat Tampa Bay, 43. For the second time during the season, Horton's name came up in trade rumours, this time with the Chicago Blackhawks. In early March, days after the trade deadline, Horton suffered a finger injury that forced him to have surgery. He returned to the lineup on March 23, recording an assist in a Panthers loss to the Carolina Hurricanes. Horton ended the season with 22 goals and 23 assists in 67 games.|$|E

[...] Kesnick thought it would be the last day of his life. He yelled, [...] "Hey, Ted, how do you pray?" [...] Guzda replied, [...] "Pray? Willie, just keep that bucket on your head."

2500|$|Continuing as Test captain, Waugh led {{the team}} to a 2–1 victory in South Africa to retain Australia's ranking as the number one team. Australia crushed the hosts in the First Test by an innings and 360 runs, won the Second Test by four wickets, before losing the last. His own form was poor, with 95 runs at 19.00. He left the tour once the ODI series began. Arriving in Australia alone, he faced media {{questioning}} over his playing future. Waugh's reply was, [...] "We've just beaten the next {{best team in the}} world 5–1, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> want to talk about is getting me out of the team." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early 2005, Rock {{hosted the}} 77th Academy Awards ceremony. The {{decision}} to have Rock host the awards was seen {{by some as a}} chance to bring an [...] "edge" [...] to the ceremony, and to make it more relevant or appealing to younger audiences. Jokingly, Rock opened by saying [...] "Welcome to the 77th and LAST Academy Awards!" [...] During one segment Rock asked, [...] "Who is this guy?" [...] in reference to actor Jude Law seemingly appearing in every movie Rock had seen that year and implied Law was a low-rent Tom Cruise (he made a joke about filmmakers rushing production when unable to get the actors they want: [...] "If you want Tom Cruise <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> can get is Jude Law, wait !"). Subsequently, a defensive Sean Penn took the stage to present and said, [...] "In answer to our host's question, Jude Law is one of our finest young actors." [...] (At the time, Penn and Law were shooting All the King's Men.) Law was not the only actor that Rock poked fun at that evening, however—he turned the joke on himself at one point, saying, [...] "If you want Denzel [...] <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> can get is me, wait!" [...] Older Oscar officials were reportedly displeased with Rock's performance, which did not elevate ratings for the ceremony. Rock was also criticized for referring to the Oscars as [...] "idiotic", and asserting that heterosexual men do not watch them, in an interview prior to Oscar night.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 November 2004, he {{announced}} he would not stand at the next general election {{and that he would}} retire from the House of Commons. On 26 November, in an interview with Robin Oakley on Radio 4, he said [...] "To be honest I found it intellectually numbing, and tedious in the extreme. I most certainly won't miss the constituency work. I've got to tell you that honestly. It's 22 years of the same cases, but just the faces and the people changing. It might sound a little disparaging to say this about people's lives and their problems and we did deal with them ... but I got no satisfaction from this at all. I really didn't. <b>And</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> were was a sort of high-powered social worker and perhaps not even a good one at that. I will miss being chairman of the works of art committee [...] [...] [...] because I was having so much intellectual enjoyment, and indeed just straightforward fun, out of reorganising our collection, and that kept me in touch with history." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 2, Interplay {{announced}} the game had been finalized {{and was ready}} for manufacture, with a release date set for November 12. The game entered the manufacturing stage on November 5. On November 8, IGN gave a full preview, again praising the graphics, and writing [...] "This game is running on a rock-solid 3D engine with completely rotatable dungeons, brilliant animation for nearly every interactive element (of which there are many), and first-rate lighting effects of all different kinds [...] In the beginning, simple refined touches are impressive, amid the generally sharp atmosphere of the game (while there is no visible aliasing, the graphics aren't heavily filtered, either). Even when {{all you have to}} fight are rats, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> have to fight with is a dagger, you can admire how barrels come apart when you smash them, in realistically shaded pieces and a puff of dust, or all the different limbs you can bloodily excise from your foes."
