40|$|An {{adaptive}} unstructured remeshing {{technique is}} evaluated for integrated fluid-thermal-structural analysis. The technique {{is combined with}} the finite element method to solve: (1) the Navier-Stokes equations for high-speed compressible flow, (2) the energy equation for the structural-thermal response, and (3) the quasi-static equilibrium equations for the structural response. The remeshing technique and the analysis solution procedure are described. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated with two <b>applications</b> <b>studies.</b> The flow analysis of Mach 8 shock-shock interference on a three-inch-diameter cylinder is used as the first <b>application</b> <b>study</b> to demonstrate the capability of the remeshing technique and to examine proper remeshing indicators for the inviscid and boundary layer regions. The applicability of the approach for the thermal and structural analyses of the structure is evaluated in the second <b>application</b> <b>study</b> of a 0. 25 -inch-diameter convectively cooled leading edge subjected to intense aerodynamic heating.

A comparison of the vortex induced rolling moment results at a separation scale distance of 0. 70 km with those measured in full scale flight indicate good agreement for the unattenuated vortex configuration.

40|$|Abstract:- One {{constant}} in computing {{which is true}} also for mobile computing is the continue requirement for greater performance. Every performance advance in mobile processors leads to another level of greater performance demands from newest mobile applications. However, on battery powered devices performance is strictly limited by the battery capacity, therefore energy efficient applications and systems have to be developed. The power consumption problem of mobile systems is in general a very complex one and remained very actual {{for quite a long}} time. In this paper we aim to define a software execution framework for mobile systems in order to characterize the power consumption profile of multi-threading mobile <b>applications.</b> <b>Study</b> results for different thread libraries, multi-core processors and multithreaded parallelized applications are also presented.

To help address this development, we also discuss the potential role for proliferation data as a component of alternative carcinogenicity testing models.
