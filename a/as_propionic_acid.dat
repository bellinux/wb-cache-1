Together with bacteria, pungent smelling acids are formed, such <b>as</b> <b>propionic</b> <b>acid,</b> butyric acid and acetic acid. Hydrogen sulfide is also produced. The salt raises the osmotic pressure of the brine above the zone where bacteria responsible for rotting can thrive and prevents decomposition of proteins into oligopeptides and amino acids.

Initial studies by Monsanto had shown iridium to be less active than rhodium for the carbonylation of methanol. Subsequent research, however, showed that the iridium catalyst could be promoted by ruthenium, and this combination leads to a catalyst that is superior to the rhodium-based systems. The switch from rhodium to iridium also allows the use of less water in the reaction mixture. This change reduces the number of drying columns necessary, decreases formation of by-products, such <b>as</b> <b>propionic</b> <b>acid,</b> and suppresses the water gas shift reaction.|$|E

An SBA- 15 -supported Ru-Fe catalyst displayed significant improvements in catalytic performance for the hydrogenolysis of acetic acid to ethanol compared with monometallic catalysts and that with SiO 2 as a carrier. When the Ru/Fe atomic ratio was set at 2 / 1, the prepared catalyst could give a nearly 100 % conversion of acetic acid and 88 % selectivity to ethanol.

In the present study, we adapted this method to human subjects. 4 d after oral administration of 100 microCi of [14 C] 26 -cholesterol and 1 d after beginning a constant infusion of 16. 6 mumol/min unlabeled acetone, three men and two women underwent breath collections. Expired acetone was trapped and purified as the 2, 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine derivative. 14 CO 2 was trapped quantitatively using phenethylamine. Specific activity of breath acetone was multiplied by the acetone infusion rate to calculate production of [14 C]acetone. [14 C]Acetone production averaged 4. 9 % of total release of 14 C from [14 C] 26 -cholesterol, estimated by 14 CO 2 output. The method was validated by showing that [14 C]acetone production from [14 C]isopropanol averaged 86. 9 % of the [14 C]-isopropanol infusion rate.

Although extensive information is available on yeast response to acetic acid stress, the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and unfolded protein response (UPR) has not been addressed. We herein demonstrated that acetic acid causes ER stress and induces the UPR. The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER and activation of Ire 1 p and Hac 1 p, an ER-stress sensor and ER stress-responsive transcription factor, respectively, were induced by a treatment with acetic acid stress (> 0. 2 % v/v). Other monocarboxylic acids such <b>as</b> <b>propionic</b> <b>acid</b> and sorbic acid, but not lactic acid, also induced the UPR. Additionally, ire 1 Δ and hac 1 Δ cells were more sensitive to acetic acid than wild-type cells, indicating that activation of the Ire 1 p-Hac 1 p pathway is required for maximum tolerance to acetic acid. Furthermore, the combination of mild acetic acid stress (0. 1 % acetic acid) and mild ethanol stress (5 % ethanol) induced the UPR, whereas neither mild ethanol stress nor mild acetic acid stress individually activated Ire 1 p, suggesting that ER stress is easily induced in yeast cells during the fermentation process of lignocellulosic hydrolysates.

40|$|Regulation of {{bile acid}} {{synthesis}} in man is incompletely understood, {{in part because}} of difficulty in making measurements over short time periods when the enterohepatic circulation is intact. We investigated the possibility of a diurnal rhythm of bile acid synthesis in three human subjects given [26 - 14 C]cholesterol. When this isotope of cholesterol, which is randomly labeled in the 26 and 27 positions, is converted to bile acid, the 14 C is released <b>as</b> <b>propionic</b> <b>acid</b> randomly labeled in the 1 and 3 positions. The labeled propionic acid is then oxidized to 14 CO 2, output of which is a function of bile acid synthesis. However, delays in transit of the 14 C through propionic acid and CO 2 -HCO- 3 pools would shift the phase and dampen the amplitude of 14 CO 2 output relative to an existing diurnal rhythm of bile acid synthesis. Therefore, using constant infusion methods, we determined the turnover constants for conversion to 14 CO 2 of [1 - 14 C]propionic acid and [3 - 14 C]propionic acid to be 0. 36 - 0. 59 h- 1 and 0. 14 - 0. 16 h- 1, respectively. Using these constants and modeling the diurnal rhythm as a cosine function, we determined that amplitude of 14 CO 2 output from [26 - 14 C]cholesterol was reduced 35 % and acrophase was delayed 2. 4 - 3. 0 h relative to the diurnal rhythm of bile acid synthesis. None of the diurnal rhythm in 14 CO 2 output from [26 - 14 C]cholesterol resulted from diurnal variation in propionic acid or CO 2 -HCO- 3 metabolism since constant infusion of [1 - 14 C]propionic acid and [3 - 14 C]propionic acid for 30 h revealed no diurnal variation in output of 14 CO 2.

Therefore salicylic and cinnamic acid structures as well <b>as</b> <b>propionic</b> <b>acid</b> and coumarin structures were inserted. Segment C: For segment C the vinylogous carboxylic acid structure was variated. Besides halogene atoms (F, Cl, Br, I, CN) malonic acid derivatives and thiols were introduced in this position. In addition known 5 -LO-inhibitors were developed further: The cysteine derivative was transformed into tricyclic benzothiazines, the 1, 2 -naphthoquinones into benzo[a]phenazines and the benzo[b]naphtho[2, 1 -d]furan was cleaved to the dihydroxylated aryl- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone. All substances were tested in cell based in vitro assays for their 5 -LO, 12 -LO and COX- 1 inhibition. Unselective compounds were also tested for their cPLA 2 (cytosolic phospholipase A 2) inhibition. The obtained data led to two important results: - All unselective compounds possess a vinylogous carboxylic acid chloride function and simultaneously inhibit cPLA 2. - Compounds with a vinylogous carboxylic acid function show different selectivities. An increase in 5 -LO-activity towards the nanomolecular range could not be achieved. The synthesis of the arylbenzoquinones issued {{in the identification of}} the minimum structure necessary for 5 -LO-inhibition. The biochemical data made it possible to distinguish the new substances due to their selectivities. In this work new inhibitors of the following categories were obtained: Selective 5 -LO- and selective COX- 1 -inhibitors as well as dual 5 -LO/COX- 1 - and 12 -LO/COX- 1 -inhibitors. For each category structure-activity-relationships were discussed. In addition the lipophilicity of the substances was determined by using a HPLC-method. There was no correlation observed between biochemical data and lipophilicity. The antioxidative activity (AOA) was detected by using the method of Popov et al. By this method strong antioxidants were identified among the new compounds whose activity was significant increased in comparison with vitamin C. Meanwhile no correlation between AOA and enzyme inhibition was observed. This confirmed that the anellated aryl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone derivatives are no redox inhibitors. AOA and 5 -LO-inhibitory activity are two independent properties of a substance...|$|E
40|$|Medium-chain-length fatty acids, such as nonanoic (9 : 0) and octanoic (8 : 0) acids, {{are more}} toxic to Ralstonia eutropha than {{volatile}} fatty <b>acids</b> such <b>as</b> acetic, <b>propionic</b> and butyric <b>acids.</b> Nonanoic acid was degraded to acetic and <b>propionic</b> <b>acids</b> via beta -oxidation by Ralstonia eutropha for cell growth and synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). In {{a mixture of}} the fatty acids, utilization of nonanoic acid was depressed by acetic and <b>propionic</b> <b>acids,</b> and vice versa. The PHA accumulation from the volatile fatty acids was decreased from 53 % (w/w) of dry cell mass to 23 % due to the nonanoic acid. Similar phenomena were also observed with octanoic acid and its metabolic intermediates, acetic and butyric acids...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic <b>propionic</b> <b>acid</b> {{degradation}} {{relies on}} interspecies electron transfer (IET) between propionate oxidisers and electron acceptor microorganisms, via either molecular hydrogen, formate or direct transfers. We evaluated {{the possibility of}} stimulating direct IET, hence enhancing propionate oxidation, by increasing availability of proton carriers to decrease solution resistance and reduce pH gradients. Phosphate {{was used as a}} proton carrying anion, and chloride as control ion together with potassium <b>as</b> counter ion. <b>Propionic</b> <b>acid</b> consumption in anaerobic granules was assessed in a square factorial design with ratios (1 : 0, 2 : 1, 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 0 : 1) of total phosphate (TP) to Cl-, at 1 X, 10 X, and 30 X native conductivity (1. 5 mS. cm(- 1)). Maximum specific uptake rate, half saturation, and time delay were estimated using model-based analysis. Community profiles were analysed by fluorescent in situ hybridisation and 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. The strongest performance was at balanced (1 : 1) ratios at 10 X conductivity where presumptive propionate oxidisers namely Syntrophobacter and Candidatus Cloacamonas were more abundant. There was a shift from Methanobacteriales at high phosphate, to Methanosaeta at low TP:Cl ratios and low conductivity. A lack of response to TP, and low percentage of presumptive electroactive organisms suggested that DIET was not favoured under the current experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIPreviously, we {{demonstrated}} that Propionibacterium acnes, a human skin commensal bacterium, ferments glycerol into short-chain fatty <b>acids,</b> including <b>propionic</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Propionic</b> <b>acid</b> suppressed {{the growth of}} Staphylococcus aureus USA 300, a community-acquired methicillin-resistant bacterium, in vitro and in vivo. In this study, it is {{demonstrated that}} the anti-USA 300 activity of <b>propionic</b> <b>acid</b> persisted after buffering the acid with 4 -(2 -hydroxyethyl) - 1 -piperazineethanesulfonic acid. This suggests that the growth suppression of USA 300 mainly resulted from the antimicrobial activity of <b>propionic</b> <b>acid</b> per se and not from the acidity of the medium. In addition, proprionic acid significantly reduced the intracellular pH of USA 300 and exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. P. acnes showed a higher tolerance to <b>propionic</b> <b>acid.</b> Next, an esterified derivative of <b>propionic</b> <b>acid</b> was synthesised. <b>Propionic</b> <b>acid</b> and the esterified derivative were equivalent in their efficacy to suppress the growth of USA 300 in vitro. The esterified derivative thus provides an alternative to <b>propionic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>as</b> an antimicrobial agent against S. aureus.
