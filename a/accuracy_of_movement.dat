40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> imagery and the skill level. It can be supposed that movement imagery has two aspects, the one is goal-movement imagery and the other is self-movement imagery. In this study, these two aspects were exmined. The subjects were 83 male undergraduate and senior high school students. They were divided into five groups according to skill levels(skill levels 1 : 10, 2 : 24, 3 : 19, 4 : 16, 5 : 14). The task was handspring in gymnastics skill. <b>Accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> imagery was measured by an imagery test developed for this skill. The results indicated a significant correlation between the test score and skill levels(goal-movement imagery:r= 0. 33, self-movement imagery:r= 0. 46). And the subjects at skill level 3 who have a gross form of this skill had a significantly higher score than those at skill level 2 in goal-movement imagery, but a significant lower score than skill levels 4 and 5 in self-movement imagery. This indicated that they have accurate goal-movement imagery, but inaccurate self-movement imagery. This suggested that seif-movement imagery plays an important role in acquisition of a higher level of this skill. But there was a nonsignificant correlation between vividness of movement imagery and the test score(goal-movement imagery:r= 0. 18, self-movement imagery:r= 0. 16). This indicated that vivid movement imagery dose not always reflect accurate movement imagery...|$|E

The authors infer that the size-accuracy ratio is capturing the control strategies employed during practice and thus promotes efficient transfer. Furthermore, efficient transfer is not dependent on maintaining relative timing invariance and thus the authors provide further evidence that relative timing is not an essential feature of movement control.

Generation of appropriate force feedback requires dynamic adjustment of feedback plant characteristics and integration of visuospatial information in a virtual reality environment.

40|$|The {{speed and}} <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> depend on several {{factors that have}} been {{previously}} identified including target size and movement amplitude. According to Fitts 2 ̆ 7 Law these variables comprise an Index of Difficulty that {{is directly related to}} the movement time. This principle of human performance has been studied extensively over a wide array of settings and contexts. The objective of this thesis was to investigate human movement time for tasks requiring precision placement of weighted objects, a task frequently encountered in industrial and occupational settings. Specifically, this thesis evaluated the effects of object weight, complexity of movement, and handedness on movement time. Complex movement in three dimensions and use of the dominant hand was found to significantly decrease movement time. It was also found that as probe weight increased, movement time increased in a logarithmic pattern. Fitts 2 ̆ 7 Law in its original form was found to be an accurate predictor of overall movement time for the data obtained in this study. However, Fitts 2 ̆ 7 original equations were improved by incorporating a term that accounted for the weight of the probe. The theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{describes the}} development of an experimental NC milling machine having control over all the 6 bodily degrees of freedom of movement. The mechanism used is called a Stewart Platform. These mechanisms have a platform connected to a base by 6 variable length "legs". The Stewart Platform is considered to have good potential as a rigid 5 axis milling machine having a simpler structure than conventional machines. Platform motion is achieved by pre-calculated movements of 6 stepper motors which actuate leg mounted lead screws. These movements are controlled using microcomputer controlled electronic hardware. The development of the system progressed along several paths among which were: path synthesis methods in six dimensions, stepper motors, simultaneous open-loop control of 6 data manipulation and storage structures in software to execute the control strategies, and {{the development of}} the existing positioning machine for milling operations. The system was successfully developed to enable machining of rigid urethane foam blocks in 5 useful degrees of freedom. The envelope of movement was restricted to +/- 100 mm translations and +/- 30 degree rotations. <b>Accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> was beyond that detectable using foam. Suggestions are made for further developments, particularly for improving the machine's envelope of movement and method of actuation...|$|E

40|$|Motor skills {{represent}} high-precision movements {{performed at}} optimal speed and accuracy. Such motor skills are learned with practice over time. Besides practice, effects of motivation {{have also been}} shown to influence speed and <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements,</b> suggesting that fast movements are performed to maximize gained reward over time as noted in previous studies. In rodents, skilled motor performance has been successfully modeled with the skilled grasping task, in which animals use their forepaw to grasp for sugar pellet rewards through a narrow window. Using sugar pellets, the skilled grasping task is inherently tied to motivation processes. In the present study, we performed three experiments modulating animals’ motivation during skilled grasping by changing the motivational state, presenting different reward value ratios, and displaying Pavlovian stimuli. We found in all three studies that motivation affected the speed <b>of</b> skilled grasping <b>movements,</b> with the strongest effects seen due to motivational state and reward value. Furthermore, <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>movement,</b> measured in success rate, showed a strong dependence on motivational state as well. Pavlovian cues had only minor effects on skilled grasping, but results indicate an inverse Pavlovian-instrumental transfer effect on movement speed. These findings have broad implications considering the increasing use of skilled grasping in studies of motor system structure, function, and recovery after injuries...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} a user to move to {{different}} locations within a virtual environment (VE) is a fundamental action that subserves the activities of exploration and manipulation. By empirical analogy, the perceptual information used to locomote to a target within a virtual environment is compared to the perceptual information used to walk to a location in the real world. An experiment is reported that had participants move to a location as accurately as possible within a VE where a target object was presented. The amount of visual feedback available to participants was manipulated. Three conditions were compared: static viewing of the target and virtual environment before locomotion, {{the disappearance of the}} target object as movement to the object was initiated, and locomotion to the target while both object and environment were present. In addition, the composition of virtual environments was either textured or polygonal. Error measures indicated that users locomote within VE's with less accuracy than those that walk blindfolded in the real world. Texture had its largest effect on the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> when optic flow was not available, that is, static estimates of distance.

40|$|Sensory {{feedback}} {{is very important}} for movement control. However, feedback information has not been directly used to update movement prediction model in the previous BMI studies, although the closed-loop BMI system provides the visual feedback to users. Here, we propose a BMI framework combining image processing as the feedback information with a novel prediction method. The feedback-prediction algorithm (FPA) generates feedback information from the positions of objects and modifies movement prediction according to the information. The FPA predicts a target among objects based on the movement direction predicted from the neural activity. After the target selection, the FPA modifies the predicted direction toward the target and modulates the magnitude of the predicted vector to easily reach the target. The FPA repeats the modification in every prediction time points. To evaluate the improvements of prediction accuracy provided by the feedback, we compared the prediction performances with feedback (FPA) and without feedback. We demonstrated that <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> prediction can be considerably improved by the FPA combining feedback information. The accuracy of the movement prediction was significantly improved for all subjects (P, 0. 001) and 32. 1 % of the mean error was reduced.

40|$|The {{capability}} of quickly (as soon as possible) producing fast uncorrected and accurate isometric force impulses was examined {{to assess the}} motor efficiency of patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and good motor recovery at a clinical evaluation. Twenty male right-handed patients with moderate to severe TBI and 24 age-matched healthy male right-handed controls participated in the study. The experimental task required subjects to aim brief and uncorrected isometric force impulses to targets visually presented along with subjects’ force displays. Both TBI patients and controls were able to produce force impulses whose mean peak amplitudes varied proportionally to the target load with no detectable group difference. Patients with TBI, however, were slower than controls in initiating their responses (reaction times [RTs] were longer by 125 msec) and were also slower during the execution of their motor responses, reaching the peak forces requested 23 msec later than controls (time to peak force: 35 % delay). Further, their mean dF/dt (35 kg/sec) was slower than that of controls (53 kg/sec), again indicating a 34 % impairment with respect to controls. Overall, patients with TBI showed accurate but delayed and slower isometric force impulses. Thus, an evaluation taking into account also response time features is more effective in picking up motor impairments than the standard clinical scales focusing on <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> only...|$|E

This study investigates the potential of virtual environments-based computer training for near-field navigation accuracy. Results of this investigation revealed significantly greater performance accuracy in a real-world setting for subjects that were first trained in a virtual environment. In addition, three levels of rendered visual detail were compared for precision of movement within a virtual hallway: (1) uutextured polygon surfaces, (2) untextured polygon surfaces with transverse floor gradient lines placed as visual cues, and (3) fully detailed textured surfaces. Significant effects were found for visual detail in <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> production.

Significant differences in real-world field performance were also found between the groups that were exposed to different levels of visual detail in computer training. Field performance was significantly superior for subjects trained with visual cues as compared to those trained in an uutextured virtual setting. Evidence suggests that for movement production accuracy both within a virtual environment and in the real world fully-detailed textured surfaces are not required in the rendered setting in order to obtain the best performance. Simple surface gradients erve as adequate visual cues for near-field navi-gation accuracy, while a lack of consistent visual cues can be detrimental to effective movement production...|$|E

A diagnosis of Parkinsonism was made if the step 1 criteria of the Queen Square Brain Bank criteria for Parkinson¡¯s disease were fulfilled. The reviewer diagnosis was compared to the working clinical diagnosis drawn from the medical history, SPECT scan result, long term follow-up and in some cases the known response to dopaminergic medications. This comparison allowed a calculation for false positive and false negative rate of diagnosis of PD. We found a high false positive (17. 4 to 26. 1 %) and negative rate (6. 7 to 20 %) for the diagnosis of PD. The diagnostic distinction of TDPD from dystonic tremor was reduced by the presence of dystonic features in treated and untreated PD patients. Clinical distinction of TDPD from atypical tremor, monosymptomatic rest tremor, and dystonic tremor can be difficult, due to the presence of parkinsonian features in tremulous SWEDD patients. The diagnosis of bradykinesia was particularly challenging. This study highlights the difficulty of differentiation of some cases of SWEDD from PD...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Laparoscopic {{splenectomy}} (LS) is {{the gold}} standard in surgical treatment of splenic hematologic diseases. Robotic surgery (RS) has changed the concept of minimally invasive surgery because of the tridimensional view, degrees of freedom, and accuracy of movements. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether RS has advantages over LS. Methods: In 2 Surgical Units experienced in laparoscopic spleen surgery, 2 groups of patients underwent LS (45 cases G 1) and RS (45 cases G 2). The 2 groups were well matched for demographic characteristic, indications, and spleen size. The median bipolar spleen diameter was 15 cm and 13 cm, respectively. Results: Between the 2 groups, there were no statistically significant differences in intraoperative blood loss (< 100 mL in both groups), conversion rate to laparotomy (5 G 1, 4 G 2), postoperative food intake, drainage removal, postoperative complications (4 hemoperitoneum and 1 pleural effusion G 1, 1 hemoperitoneum and 4 pleural effusion G 2) and median postoperative hospital stay. On the contrary, statistically significant differences were observed for median operative time (125 minutes G 1, 153 G 2) and costs (US$ 1. 600 G 1, US$ 6. 930 G 2). Transfusion and mortality rate were 0 %. The follow-up at 6 months does not highlight late-surgical complications. Conclusion: The analysis of the data does not show advantages of RS over LS. RS even though it offers a tridimensional view of the operative field and the degrees of freedom and <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> that are superior to that of LS, has longer operative time and higher costs.
