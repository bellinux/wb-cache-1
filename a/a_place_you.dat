500|$|... "Slow Fade" [...] {{was written}} in the [...] "light of the well publicised falls from grace of several high profile church leaders". According to lead vocalist Mark Hall: [...] "Nobody falls, it's just a slow fade. It's a series of minor compromises until you're in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>you</b> never thought you'd be, doing things you never thought you'd do and rationalising all of it". He {{continued}} by saying that: [...] "As believers, as men, if we're not guarding our relationship with God, we're going down. There's too much going against us. If we're not careful, we're going to crash and burn".|$|E
500|$|After having {{arrived in}} the Hawaiian islands in 1778, Captain Cook sailed north and then {{north-east}} to explore {{the west coast of}} North America north of the Spanish settlements in Alta California. He made landfall on the Oregon coast at approximately 44°30′ north latitude, naming his landing point Cape Foulweather. Bad weather forced his ships south to about 43° north before they could begin their exploration of the coast northward. In March 1778, Cook landed on Bligh Island and named the inlet [...] "King George's Sound". He recorded that the native name was Nutka or Nootka, apparently misunderstanding his conversations at Friendly Cove/Yuquot; his informant may have been explaining that he was on an island (itchme nutka, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>you</b> can [...] "go around"). There may also have been confusion with Nuu-chah-nulth, the natives' autonym (name for themselves). It may also have simply been based on Cook’s mispronunciation of Yuquot, the native name of the place.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Omega taking over Bullet Club's leadership, he and The Young Bucks formed their own subgroup within the stable, called [...] "The Elite". Omega and The Young Bucks {{came up with the}} idea for The Elite themselves, feeling the need to create something new after being forced by NJPW into Bullet Club and what Omega called a [...] "Too Sweet", [...] "Suck it" [...] parody of the nWo. Omega stated that he and The Young Bucks were The Elite, but accepted if NJPW continued calling them Bullet Club [...] "in parentheses" [...] as the stable was their [...] "cash cow". He explained the name change by stating that following Anderson, Gallows and Styles' departures from NJPW, [...] "Bullet Club [...] so much the Bullet Club anymore", adding that the stable [...] "had all sorts of wrestlers come and go. Some were good, some were bad, some were god-awful", but that [...] "there's <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>you</b> can go to watch the most ridiculous and entertaining stuff in pro wrestling, and it's The Elite". Omega later added his opinion that Anderson, Gallows and Styles' departures had [...] "watered down" [...] Bullet Club's ranks, which is why he wanted to push The Elite to the forefront, claiming that when people said that [...] "Bullet Club [...] been doing some really cool stuff", they always meant him and The Young Bucks and not the other members of the group.|$|E

2500|$|Jewish {{men were}} {{being picked up}} and put into {{concentration}} camps. They were told you have X {{amount of time to}} leave—two weeks, a month—if you can find a country that will take you. Outside, their wives and friends were struggling to get a passport, a visa, anything to help them get out. But embassies were closing their doors all over, and countries, including the United States, were closing their borders. ...

2500|$|Many people {{relished the}} {{neighborhood}} {{as a home}} for society's outcasts. [...] Getrude Briggs, owner of East 7th Street store Books 'n' Things, and a resident of forty-one years: [...] "Of course [...] still attracts a lot of freaks, because it's still <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>you</b> can be free. [...] For a lot of kids, coming here {{is a way to}} get away from the choking atmosphere of suburbia." [...] Thirty-year resident Barbara Shawm protested the East Village's dangerous reputation: [...] "A 90-pound woman can easily fend off a down-and-outer or an addict. [...] They're not dangerous. It's more dangerous uptown [...] what people do to each other in elevators." ...|$|E
2500|$|St. Elsewhere {{was set at}} {{the fictional}} St. Eligius Hospital, a {{decaying}} urban teaching hospital in Boston's South End neighborhood. (The South End's Franklin Square House Apartments, {{formerly known as the}} St. James Hotel and located next to Franklin and Blackstone Squares, stood in for the hospital in establishing shots, including the series' opening sequence.) The hospital's nickname, [...] "St. Elsewhere", is a slang term used in the medical field to refer to lesser-equipped hospitals that serve patients turned away by more prestigious institutions; it is also used in medical academia to refer to teaching hospitals in general. In the pilot episode, surgeon Dr. Mark Craig (William Daniels) informs his colleagues that the local Boston media had bestowed the derogatory nickname upon St. Eligius since they perceived the hospital as [...] "a dumping ground, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't want to send your mother-in-law." [...] In fact, the hospital was so poorly regarded that its shrine to Saint Eligius was commonly defiled by the hospital's visitors and staff, and is passingly referred to by Dr. Wayne Fiscus as [...] "the patron saint of longshoremen and bowlers." [...] (Eligius is neither; he is patron saint of numismatists, metalworkers, and horses.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Boulanger {{had as many}} as 40 {{students}} at once and employed a formal regimen that Copland had to follow. Copland found her incisive mind much to his liking and found her ability to critique a composition impeccable. Boulanger [...] "could always find the weak spot in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>you</b> suspected was weak.... She could also tell you why it was weak [...]" [...] He {{wrote in a letter}} to his brother Ralph, [...] "This intellectual Amazon is not only professor at the Conservatoire, is not only familiar with all music from Bach to Stravinsky, but is prepared for anything worse in the way of dissonance. But make no mistake... A more charming womanly woman never lived." [...] Copland later wrote that [...] "it was wonderful for me to find a teacher with such openness of mind, while at the same time she held firm ideas of right and wrong in musical matters. The confidence she had in my talents and her belief in me were at the very least flattering and more—they were crucial to my development at this time of my career." [...] Though he planned on only one year abroad, he studied with her for three years, finding her eclectic approach inspired his own broad musical taste.|$|E
