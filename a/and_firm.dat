5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> to the touch. The pustules were {{deeply embedded in}} the dermis, giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end of}} the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of 19 November, a {{thunderstorm}} followed by a drenching downpour broke over the opposing armies. In a few hours every wadi in the foothills and on the plain was in flood. The black soil plain, hard <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> during summer, became in these winter conditions sticky and heavy for marching and almost impassable for wheeled vehicles. The temperature, which had been hot {{during the day and}} pleasant at night, dropped rapidly to become piercingly cold. The infantrymen had been marching light in their summer uniform of twill shorts and tunics. With only one blanket (and/or a Greatcoat), this gear gave little protection from the driving rain and bitter chill.|$|E

50|$|In {{game theory}} and {{classical}} economics, {{it is often}} assumed that the actors, people, <b>and</b> <b>firms</b> are rational. However, {{the extent to which}} people <b>and</b> <b>firms</b> behave rationally is subject to debate. Economists often assume the models of rational choice theory and bounded rationality to formalize and predict the behavior of individuals <b>and</b> <b>firms.</b> Rational agents sometimes behave in manners that are counter-intuitive to many people, as in the traveler's dilemma.|$|R

5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely {{buried in the}} ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner spore sac. The spore sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white <b>and</b> <b>firm,</b> but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits {{around the perimeter of}} the spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released.|$|E
5|$|Lambertia formosa {{is readily}} grown in {{cultivation}} given a sunny position and fair drainage, though it tolerates {{a range of}} soils and some shade. Its flowers attract birds, especially important as this can provide a source of food year-round. The plant responds well to pruning. Seeds germinate within 25 to 60 days of sowing, <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> young growth makes the best cutting material for propagation. Fertilisers generally are not needed, but slow release low-phosphorus fertilisers are tolerated. The species is frost-hardy and grows in temperate to subtropical climates.|$|E
5|$|Stanisław II Augustus (also Stanisław August Poniatowski; born Stanisław Antoni Poniatowski; 17 January 1732 – 12 February 1798) was {{the last}} King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania and the last monarch of the united Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1764–95). He remains a {{controversial}} figure in Polish history. Recognized as a great patron {{of the arts and}} sciences and an initiator <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> supporter of progressive reforms, he is also remembered as the last king of the Commonwealth whose election was marred by Russian involvement. He is criticized primarily for his failure to stand against the partitions, and thus to prevent the destruction of Poland.|$|E

The mediating effect was found to be significant and positive which demonstrated that R&D department mediated the relationship between external knowledge <b>and</b> <b>firm’s</b> open innovation performance. On the other hand, t-value was 3.945 and β-value was 0.459 for internal innovation <b>and</b> <b>firm’s</b> open innovation performance. Significant mediation effect showed that R&D department mediated the relationship between internal innovation <b>and</b> <b>firm’s</b> open innovation performance. Hence, it could be described that R&D department reflects the positive effect of external knowledge and internal innovation on firm’s open innovation performance in Malaysian SMEs.|$|R

5|$|Labradors have a {{reputation}} as a very even-tempered breed and an excellent family dog. This includes a good reputation with children of all ages and other animals. Some lines, particularly those that have continued to be bred specifically for their skills at working in the field (rather than for their appearance), are particularly fast and athletic. Their fun-loving boisterousness and lack of fear may require training <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> handling at times to ensure it does not get out of hand—an uncontrolled adult can be quite problematic. Females may be slightly more independent than males. Labradors mature at around three years of age; before this time they can have a significant degree of puppy-like energy, often mislabelled as being hyperactive. Because of their enthusiasm, leash-training early on is suggested to prevent pulling when full-grown. Labradors often enjoy retrieving a ball endlessly (often obsessively) and other forms of activity (such as agility, frisbee, or flyball).Although they will sometimes bark at noise, especially noise from an unseen source ("alarm barking"), Labradors are usually not noisy or territorial. They are often very easygoing and trusting with strangers and therefore are not usually suitable as guard dogs.|$|E
5|$|Sino-Roman {{relations}} {{comprised the}} mostly indirect contact, flow of trade goods, information, and occasional travellers between the Roman Empire and Han Empire of China, {{as well as}} between the later Eastern Roman Empire and various Chinese dynasties. These empires inched progressively closer {{in the course of the}} Roman expansion into the ancient Near East and simultaneous Han Chinese military incursions into Central Asia. Mutual awareness remained low, <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> knowledge about each other was limited. Only a few attempts at direct contact are known from records. Intermediate empires such as the Parthians and Kushans, seeking to maintain lucrative control over the silk trade, inhibited direct contact between these two Eurasian powers. In 97 AD, the Chinese general Ban Chao tried to send his envoy Gan Ying to Rome, but Gan was dissuaded by Parthians from venturing beyond the Persian Gulf. Several alleged Roman emissaries to China were recorded by ancient Chinese historians. The first one on record, supposedly from either the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius or his adopted son Marcus Aurelius, arrived in 166 AD. Others are recorded as arriving in 226 and 284 AD, with a long absence until the first recorded Byzantine embassy in 643 AD.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the British Expeditionary Force, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, already had plans in place for an attack near Amiens. When the British retreat had ended in April, {{the headquarters of the}} British Fourth Army under General Sir Henry Rawlinson had taken over the front astride the Somme. Its left hand corps was the British III Corps under Lieutenant General Richard Butler, while the Australian Corps under Lieutenant General John Monash held the right flank and linked up with French armies to the south. On 30 May, all the Australian infantry divisions were united under the corps HQ, {{for the first time on}} the Western Front. The Australians had mounted a number of local counter-attacks which both revealed the suitability of the open <b>and</b> <b>firm</b> terrain south of the Somme for a larger offensive and also established and refined the methods which were to be used.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} how {{the technological}} {{uncertainty of the}} environment in which firms operate affect the relationship between market orientation <b>and</b> <b>firm's</b> economic performance. The study is based on a longitudinal dataset, which comprises all large <b>and</b> mid-caps <b>firms</b> included in the Standard and Poors index (500 and 400 respectively) from 1989 to 2004 and that belong to manufacturing and computer sectors. Paper's results show that in highly uncertain technological environments a reverse u-shape relationship links market orientation <b>and</b> <b>firm's</b> economic performance. Conversely in slightly uncertain technological environments a u-shape relationship links market orientation <b>and</b> <b>firm's</b> economic performance. Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine how}} {{insiders}} <b>and</b> <b>firms</b> trade when arbitrage is limited. When arbitrage is costly (proxied by high idiosyncratic risk), insiders <b>and</b> <b>firms</b> earn higher absolute returns on their trades (insider trading, share repurchases, and seasoned equity offerings) {{in the following}} year. Furthermore, they initiate their trades following greater past price movements in the preceding year. These results are not driven by information asymmetry or firm size. Overall, our {{results are consistent with}} the idea that insiders <b>and</b> <b>firms</b> compete with outside arbitrageurs in exploiting mispricings and benefit when outside arbitrage is limited...|$|R

30|$|Thema: In today’s ever-changing {{economic}} conditions, workers <b>and</b> <b>firms</b> {{are experiencing}} the constant pressure to adjust employment, wages, working hours, technology, and human capital {{to meet new}} needs. Often, workers <b>and</b> <b>firms</b> face {{the question of whether}} or not to migrate. Increasing international integration, changing demand for goods and services, as well as changing institutions require labour market flexibility. Government policies to secure the interests of workers <b>and</b> <b>firms</b> are being challenged by changes in goods and labour markets, <b>and</b> increasingly heterogeneous <b>firms</b> <b>and</b> workforces are questioning the efficiency of traditional institutions. This workshop invites empirical and theoretical contributions to this topic from all areas of labour economics and related fields such as the economics of education, industrial economics, health economics, international economics, or public finance.|$|R
