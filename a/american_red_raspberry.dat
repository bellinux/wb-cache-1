5000|$|A {{closely related}} plant in North America, {{sometimes}} {{regarded as the}} variety Rubus idaeus var. strigosus, is more commonly treated as a distinct species, Rubus strigosus (<b>American</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Raspberry),</b> as is done here. [...] Red-fruited cultivated raspberries, even in North America, are generally Rubus idaeus or horticultural derivatives of hybrids of R. idaeus and R. strigosus; these plants are all addressed in the present article.|$|E
50|$|Rubus strigosus, the <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>raspberry</b> or American raspberry, is {{a species}} of Rubus native to much of North America. It has often been treated as a variety or {{subspecies}} of the closely related Eurasian Rubus idaeus (raspberry or European raspberry), but currently is more commonly treated as a distinct species. Many of the commercial raspberry cultivars grown for their fruit derive from hybrids between R. strigosus and R. idaeus; see Raspberry for more details.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the most}} {{important}} modern commercial <b>red</b> <b>raspberry</b> cultivars derive from hybrids between R. idaeus and R. strigosus. Some botanists consider the Eurasian and <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>raspberries</b> to belong to a single, circumboreal species, Rubus idaeus, with the European plants then classified as either R. idaeus subsp. idaeus or R. idaeus var. idaeus, and the native North <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>raspberries</b> classified as either R. idaeus subsp. strigosus, or R. idaeus var. strigosus. Recent breeding has resulted in cultivars that are thornless and more strongly upright, not needing staking.|$|R
5000|$|Botanists {{have long}} debated the taxonomic {{treatment}} of the Eurasian and <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>raspberries,</b> with some viewing all of these plants {{as members of a}} single, circumboreal species Rubus idaeus, and others recognizing two (or more) species within this group. [...] The two species share many similarities, and probably recently diverged from a common ancestor, leading to differences in taxonomic interpretation, particularly regarding the more intermediate eastern Asian plants. A common current treatment, followed here, is to classify the North <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>raspberries</b> as Rubus strigosus, and include only the Eurasian plants in Rubus idaeus. When the species are combined, as done in some recent publications, the Eurasian plants are Rubus idaeus ssp. idaeus (or Rubus idaeus var. idaeus), and the American plants R. idaeus ssp. strigosus (or R. idaeus var. strigosus). Different interpretations are also sometimes made regarding placement of various eastern Asian populations of this group, by some considered to represent additional varieties or subspecies, if not different species altogether. The most distinctive physical difference among these plants is usual presence of gland-tipped hairs on first-year canes, petioles, pedicels, and calyces of R. strigosus, lacking in R. idaeus.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{treatments}} {{have recognized}} dozens of species each for what other, comparably qualified botanists have considered single, more variable species. On the other hand, {{species in the}} other Rubus subgenera (such as the raspberries) are generally distinct, or else involved in more routine one-or-a-few taxonomic debates, such as whether the European and <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>raspberries</b> are better treated as one species or two. (In this case, the two-species view is followed here, with Rubus idaeus and R. strigosus both recognized; if these species are combined, then the older name R. idaeus has priority for the broader species.) ...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] vitro propagation is important for rapid multiplication {{of a wide range of}} nursery crops, including <b>red</b> <b>raspberries.</b> The genetic variation of the many <b>red</b> <b>raspberry</b> cultivars makes it difficult to use one growth medium for all. Although some cultivars grow well on Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium (MS), others display stunting, hyperhydricity, discoloration, callus, leaf spots, or necrosis. This study used response surface methodology (RSM) to determine the effects of MS mineral salts on <b>red</b> <b>raspberry</b> growth and which of these mineral salts are critical for improving growth. In vitro growth of five <b>red</b> <b>raspberry</b> cultivars was determined by varying five factors that included NH₄NO₃, KNO₃, mesos salts (CaCl₂, KH₂PO₄ and MgSO₄), minor elements (Zn–Mn–Cu–Co–Mo–B–I), and EDTA-chelated iron. The effects of these five factors on plant quality, multiplication, shoot length, leaf size, leaf area, leaf color, callus and leaf spots were determined. The effects varied by cultivar for some characteristics, but all cultivars had improved growth or appearance on some experimental treatments when compared to MS medium. Increased mesos was the most significant factor associated with plant quality, multiplication and shoot length in all cultivars. Increasing iron above MS levels decreased quality in all cultivars except ‘Willamette’. Decreased KNO₃ with increased mesos and low iron were required to improve shoot multiplication. Increased NH₄NO₃ resulted in greater shoot elongation only in ‘Willamette’.

For comparison, postharvest treatment with the commercial stereoisomeric mixture of MJ in conjunction with ethanol was simultaneously accomplished. The levels obtained were contrasted with those determined in untreated (control) samples. Exogenous (+) -MJ induced an enhancement in the levels of myricetin, quercetin and, particularly, kaempferol whereas the exposition to (-) -MJ exhibited the opposite effect. Enzymatic assays were carried out in presence and absence of (-) -MJ and (+) -MJ to evaluate possible changes in {{the activity of the}} enzymes regulating the bioformation of flavonols in <b>red</b> <b>raspberries</b> {{as a consequence of the}} treatments. From the results of the assays both (-) -MJ and (+) -MJ inhibited the activity of flavanone 3 β-hydroxylase (FHT) and flavonol synthase (FLS), which are directly involved in the formation of flavonols from (-/+) -naringenin. From these results, it is speculated that the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) regulating the formation of (-/+) -naringenin from l-phenylalanine by (+) -MJ in conjunction with ethanol is promoted.
