5|$|Stamford {{branch manager}} Josh Porter (Charles Esten) reveals {{that he has}} {{leveraged}} the situation to obtain a better position at Staples, throwing the restructuring into disarray. The new plan is to close Stamford instead, and Jan offers Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) the number two position in Scranton, but he is reluctant to <b>accept</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the inhabitants today are Muslim, but there are small Christian and Samaritan communities as well. Much of the local Palestinian Muslim population of Nablus {{is believed to be}} descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Certain Nabulsi family names are associated with Samaritan ancestry – Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others. According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted due to persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to <b>accept</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|The term baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{originates}} in the New Testament, and all Christian traditions <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> as a theological concept. Nevertheless, different Christian denominations and traditions have interpreted its meaning {{in a variety}} of ways due to differences in the doctrines of salvation and ecclesiology. As a result, Spirit baptism has been variously defined as part of the sacraments of initiation into the church, as being synonymous with regeneration, as being synonymous with Christian perfection, or as being a second work of grace that empowers a person for Christian life and service.|$|E

5|$|Betances {{was awarded}} the rank of Chévalier (Knight) of the Legion of Honor by the French {{government}} in July 1887, for {{his work as a}} diplomat for the Dominican Republic, and for his work as a medical doctor in France. He had been offered the award as early as 1882, but had repeatedly declined the honor out of humility, until friends from Puerto Rico persuaded him to <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> as a tribute to Puerto Rico, and not as a personal award. The French Legion of Honor (Légion d'honneur) is the premier order of France, and its award is one of great distinction.|$|E
5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} the Egyptian fleet was sent to {{circumnavigate}} Salamis, and block the northern exit from the Straits. If Xerxes wanted to trap the Allies completely, this maneuver would have made sense (especially {{if he was not}} expecting the Allies to fight). However, Herodotus does not mention this (and possibly alludes to the Egyptian presence in the main battle), leading some modern historians to dismiss it; though again, others <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> as a possibility. Xerxes had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as Psyttaleia, {{in the middle of the}} exit from the straits, in order to kill or capture any Greeks who ended up there (as a result of shipwreck or grounding).|$|E
5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting {{towards the end}} of April, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked Manekshaw if he was {{prepared}} {{to go to war with}} Pakistan. In response, Manekshaw told her most of his armoured and infantry divisions were deployed elsewhere, only 12 of his tanks were combat-ready, and they would be competing for rail carriages with the grain harvest at that point of time. He also pointed out the Himalayan passes would soon open up, with the forthcoming monsoon in East Pakistan, which would result in heavy flooding. When Gandhi asked the cabinet to leave the room and Manekshaw to stay, he offered to resign. She declined to <b>accept</b> <b>it,</b> but sought his advice. He then said he could guarantee victory if she would allow him to prepare for the conflict on his terms, and set a date for it, and Gandhi agreed.|$|E

The case was debated in Oswiu's presence at the Synod of Whitby in 664, with Colmán, Hild and Cedd defending the Celtic rite and the tradition inherited from Aidan, and Wilifred speaking for the Roman position. The Roman cause prevailed and the former division of ecclesiastical authorities was set aside. Those who could not <b>accept</b> <b>it,</b> including Colmán, departed elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's {{body was}} simply left behind {{at the site}} of his execution. One chronicle tells of how four shoemakers brought it to Warwick, who refused to <b>accept</b> <b>it,</b> and ordered them to take it back outside his jurisdiction. Eventually, a group of Dominican friars brought it to Oxford. A proper burial could not be {{arranged}} while Gaveston was still excommunicate, and it was not until 2 January 1315, after the King had secured a papal absolution for his favourite, that he could have his body buried in an elaborate ceremony at the Dominican foundation of King's Langley Priory; the tomb is now lost. In 1823, a cross with inscription was erected at Blacklow Hill by local squire, Bertie Greathead, at the place believed to be the location of Gaveston's execution.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, President Dwight Eisenhower {{nominated}} Cooper as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal. During {{his time}} as a delegate for the United Nations, Cooper had met Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and established a cordial working relationship with the Indian delegation, including Nehru's sister Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit. The Indians had been impressed with Cooper and the Indian government had expressed their desire that Cooper serve as their ambassador from the U.S. Cooper initially rejected the offer of the Indian ambassadorship from Secretary of State John Foster Dulles but was convinced to <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> by a personal request from President Eisenhower. The Senate confirmed Cooper's nomination on February 4, 1955.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, the United States, Russia, the European Union (EU) and the UN {{sought to}} replace the Vance plan, which brought in the UNPROFOR. They {{formulated}} the Z-4 Plan giving Serb-majority areas in Croatia substantial autonomy. After numerous and frequently uncoordinated changes to the proposed plan, including leaking of its draft elements to the press in October, the Z-4 Plan was presented on 30 January 1995. Neither Croatia nor the RSK liked the plan. Croatia was concerned that the RSK might <b>accept</b> <b>it,</b> but Tuđman realised that Milošević, who would ultimately make the decision for the RSK, would not accept the plan for fear that it would set a precedent for a political settlement in Kosovoallowing Croatia to accept the plan with little possibility {{for it to be}} implemented. The RSK refused to receive, let alone accept, the plan.|$|E
5|$|In April 1974, Nixon {{announced}} that he would appoint Cooper to be the US Ambassador to East Germany, but during the final negotiations between the countries for the US to establish an embassy in the country, Nixon resigned. His successor, Gerald Ford, officially appointed Cooper to the ambassadorship, and Cooper took leave from Covington & Burling to <b>accept</b> <b>it.</b> He arrived in East Germany in December 1974 and served as ambassador until October 1976. After returning to the US, he resumed his work at Covington & Burling. In his last act of public service, he again served as an alternate delegate to the UN General Assembly in 1981.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in his own right. George Edmunds was again the favored candidate among reformers and John Sherman had a few delegates pledged to him, but neither was expected to command much support at the convention. John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur’s campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted to try for the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman’s older brother, to <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> if it came to him, but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.|$|E

5|$|P. S. Raman, {{who went}} to Chennai in 1963 to join a medical college, was asked to see Sridhar, who was auditioning {{newcomers}} for the film. Raman was renamed Ravichandran and introduced in this film, as the character Ashok. Sivakumar had auditioned for the role before it went to Ravichandran. During a flight, Sridhar met an air-hostess named Vasundhara Devi and approached her to play one of the female leads. Because she shared her name with Vasundhara Devi, the mother of actress Vyjayanthimala, Sridhar renamed her Kanchana to avoid confusion. Telugu actor Krishna has stated that he was offered {{a role in the}} film by Sridhar, but he could not <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> due to his lack of knowledge in Tamil.|$|E
5|$|Pembroke lodged his {{prisoner}} in Deddington in Oxfordshire. On 10 June, while Pembroke was away, Warwick forcibly carried away Gaveston to Warwick Castle. Here, {{in the presence}} of Warwick, Lancaster and other magnates, Gaveston was sentenced to death at an improvised court. On 19 June he was taken to a place called Blacklow Hillon Lancaster's landsand decapitated. According to the Annales Londonienses chronicle, four shoemakers brought the corpse back to Warwick, but he refused to <b>accept</b> <b>it,</b> and ordered them to take it back to where they found it. Gaveston's body was eventually taken to Oxford by some Dominican friars, and in 1315, King Edward finally had it buried at Kings Langley.|$|E
5|$|Pezuela was deposed by a military-liberal coup, and José de la Serna e Hinojosa {{became the}} new viceroy. De la Serna called San Martín to {{negotiate}} {{an end of}} hostilities. The result was the same than with Pezuela: De la Serna proposed to enact the 1812 Spanish constitution (Perú inside Spain), and San Martín demanded the independence of Peru (with an independent monarchy). The rejection of the Spanish constitution was motivated by the disproportional representation of the Americas in the Constituent Assembly that wrote it. Both armies agreed a temporary armistice. San Martín proposed to establish an constitutional monarchy with a European monarch, with a regency ruling in the interim. The proposal was rejected, {{on the grounds that}} they could not <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> without Ferdinand's approval.|$|E
