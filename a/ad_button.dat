5000|$|... 2000 AD went all-colour {{about this}} time (prog 723, dated 23 March 1991), in {{response}} to a short-lived new colour weekly, Toxic!, launched by Pat Mills and many of the core 2000 AD team of creators. Toxic! only lasted 31 issues but many of the creators who had worked on the comic eventually found their way to work for 2000 <b>AD.</b> <b>Button</b> Man, a contemporary thriller by John Wagner and Arthur Ranson, was originally intended for Toxic! but ended up in 2000 AD.|$|E

50|$|InfrActables is a back {{projection}} collaborative table that allows interaction by using TUIs that incorporate state recognition. <b>Adding</b> different <b>buttons</b> to the TUIs enables additional functions associated to the TUIs. Newer {{versions of the}} technology can even be integrated into LC-displays by using infrared sensors behind the LC matrix.|$|R
5000|$|Staples's first {{published}} work was [...] "Amphibious Nightmare", a 24-hour comic {{included in the}} About Comics anthology 24 Hour Comics Day Highlights 2005. Her first series assignment was 2006's Done to Death, working with writer Andrew Foley for Markosia. She {{was one of the}} illustrators of WildStorm's Trick 'r Treat graphic novel, an adaptation of the Michael Dougherty film. She was the penciller and inker of The Secret History of the Authority: Hawksmoor, written by Mike Costa. She also coloured Frazer Irving's art for the 2000 <b>AD</b> story <b>Button</b> Man.|$|R
50|$|Picsearch also {{develops}} {{and provides}} an Online Video Platform under {{the brand name}} Screen9 which is used for video communities, vlogging (video blog), video reviews on e-commerce sites, corporate video presentations, news videos and virtual showings on real estate portals. Picsearch video streaming service includes flash player, upload, transcoding, hosting and streaming. Some features of the service are flexible quality (bitrate, resolution, codec), user interaction (action <b>buttons,</b> <b>ad</b> support, rating etc.) and branding possibilities (logotype, off-site embedding, player branding, mobile support etc.).|$|R
50|$|Many ads {{could be}} skipped. However, some cannot and many disable all buttons, forcing the {{listener}} {{to hear the}} ad before any music is played. Ads which can be skipped have no label or video. However, skipping ads accounts toward the hourly skip limit. <b>Ads</b> disabling all <b>buttons</b> are, as of March 2009, advertising hair products. Such ads often play upon the player's launch, {{and some of them}} have a video, which can cause problems do to increased memory usage. An occasional Nesquik ad disables the pause and skip buttons, but the channel can be changed. Refreshing the web page will generally work to skip adds.|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, Grant and Ranson {{produced}} a trilogy of Mazeworld tales between 1996 and 1999. Because it is creator-owned, like some other strips {{to appear in}} 2000 <b>AD</b> such as <b>Button</b> Man, Grant recalls that the duo [...] "had hopes of selling it for syndication, or perhaps as a computer game." [...] It was licensed in [...] "the US by Caliber Comics, which promptly printed the books in black and white, lost much of Arthur's artwork, failed to pay us a bean, then went bust." [...] In the quoted interview, interviewer James Mackay notes that serendipitously Ranson had been recently contacted by [...] "one of the brothers who ran Caliber Comics," [...] who talked to Ranson about returning his Mazeworld artwork.|$|R

5000|$|While the {{graphics}} in Strider 2 now consist of 2D character sprites overlaid over 3D backgrounds, its gameplay remains similar to its 2D side-scrolling predecessor. The controls {{consists of an}} eight-way joystick and three action buttons. The playable character Strider Hiryu can now perform new actions {{in addition to the}} ones he had in the first game. Hiryu can walk, jump, crouch, slide, and climb walls and ceilings like he would in the original game, as well as dash by pushing the joystick left or right twice, do a double jump by pressing jump in mid-air, and do a backward somersault jump while sliding. When climbing a wall, Hiryu can perform a thrust jump by holding joystick away from the wall and pressing the Jump <b>button.</b> <b>Added</b> to his regular sword attack, Hiryu can now do a [...] "Savage Slash" [...] technique in mid-air by pressing the joystick down and up in mid-air. In addition to the Attack and Jump buttons, the player can power-up their character by pressing the [...] "Boost" [...] button if they have at least one Boost item in stock. While in Boost mode, Hiryu can shoot Plasma Waves with his sword for a limited period until the Boost gauge under Hiryu's life gauge runs out. Throughout the game, the player can pick up power-up items such as health replenishments and extensions, a cypher extension, and additional boosts. The player can obtain various miscellaneous point items based on other Capcom games, such as the Yashichi and the Sakichi symbols from Vulgus and the [...] "zenny" [...] coins from Black Tiger and Forgotten Worlds, that will increase the player's score.|$|R

New ninja report tool: make scatter plots of any two table columns! Plot data now saved in multiqc_data when 'flat' image plots are created Allows you easily re-plot the data (eg. in Excel) for further downstream investigation <b>Added</b> 'Apply' <b>button</b> to Highlight / Rename / Hide. These tools can become slow with large reports. This means that you can enter several things without having to wait for the report to replot each change. Report heatmaps can now be sorted by highlight New config options decimalPoint_format and thousandsSep_format Allows you to change the default 1 234. 56 number formatting for plots. New config option top_modules allows you to specify modules that should come {{at the top of the}} report Fixed bar plot bug where missing categories could shift data between samples Report title now printed in the side navigation Missing plot IDs added for easier plot exporting Stopped giving warnings about skipping directories (now a debug message) Added warnings in report about missing functionality for flat plots (exporting and toolbox) Export button has contextual text for images / data Fixed a bug where user config files were loaded twice Fixed bug where module order was random if [...] module or [...] exclude was used.
