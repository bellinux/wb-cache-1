500|$|Onstage, Me and Juliet is concluding.

Seeing Bob enter with <b>a</b> <b>scowl,</b> Larry orders him and Sidney to be present the next morning to re-angle the lights.

[...] Jeanie is congratulated by her showmates, but Larry, all business, waves them to their places to rehearse the scene.

500|$|At {{the time}} of the speeches, Patton was {{attempting}} to keep a low profile among the press, as he had been ordered to by General Dwight Eisenhower. Patton was made a central figure in an elaborate phantom army deception scheme, and the Germans believed he was in Dover preparing the First United States Army Group for an invasion of Pas de Calais. On each occasion, he would wear his polished helmet, full dress uniform, and gleaming riding boots, and carry a riding crop to snap for effect. Patton frequently kept his face in <b>a</b> <b>scowl</b> he referred to as his [...] "war face". He would arrive in a Mercedes and deliver his remarks on a raised platform surrounded by a very large audience seated around the platform and on surrounding hills. Each address was delivered to a division-sized force of 15,000 or more men.|$|E
