5|$|At the 1962 Varna Olympiad, Fischer {{predicted}} {{that he would}} defeat Argentinian GM Miguel Najdorf in 25 moves. Fischer <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> it in 24, becoming the only player to beat Najdorf in the tournament. Ironically, Najdorf lost the game whilst employing the very opening variation named after him: the Sicilian Najdorf.|$|E
5|$|In April, Harvey began seeking {{industries}} {{to move to}} Monte Ne, but few <b>actually</b> <b>did.</b> Monte Ne's small downtown area had at one time a general store, a livery stable, a gristmill, and a post office.

5|$|As David Halberstam {{put it in}} {{his book}} Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made,Michael Jordan and David Falk helped make each other, and each profited to a {{remarkable}} degree from their special collaboration. It is true that Michael Jordan was the person who in the end <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> the deeds, went on the court and hit the final jump shot again and again, but {{it is also true that}} David Falk helped revolutionize the process of representing a basketball player, going into a team sport and creating the idea of the individual player as a commercial superstar.|$|E
5|$|Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford, Leslie's self-absorbed and underachieving subordinate. While {{he is an}} {{employee}} at the parks department, he cares little about his job, and is instead more focused on his entrepreneurial ambitions. He takes great pride in his appearance and regularly pursues women despite being married. During the season it is revealed that his marriage to his wife Wendy is a green card marriage, and he and Wendy go through a divorce after she obtains her citizenship. This affects Tom greater than he anticipated, as he realizes that he <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> harbor feelings for Wendy.|$|E

5|$|Historical markers {{concerning}} Hines' exploits have occasionally included mistaken information. The historical marker {{placed by}} the Indiana Civil War Centennial Commission in 1963 {{in the vicinity}} of Derby, Perry County, Indiana, to memorialize Hines' entry into Indiana states that Hines invaded Indiana in 1862, although he <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> so in 1863. In addition, a marker by the Confederate Monument of Bowling Green in Bowling Green's Fairview Cemetery says that Hines died before he could go to the dedication ceremony in 1876, when in reality he died in 1898 and is buried a few hundred feet away.|$|E
5|$|However, the two missionaries, who {{had become}} just as much explorers as they were missionaries, became quite {{interested}} in Kilimanjaro, and Krapf sought permission of the Mombasa governor for an expedition {{to the land of}} the Jagga, a people now known as the Chaga, who lived and live on the actual slopes of Kilimanjaro. Krapf told the governor that this journey would be work-based. Despite this, Krapf <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> not accompany Rebmann on the journey, so only Bwana Kheri and Rebmann left for Kilimanjaro on April 27, 1848.|$|E
5|$|Sherman and Hayes {{agreed to}} {{stockpile}} gold {{in preparation for}} the exchange of greenbacks for specie. The Act remained unpopular in some quarters, leading to four attempts to repeal it in the Senate and fourteen in the House—all unsuccessful. By this time, public confidence in the Treasury had grown to the extent that a dollar in gold was worth only $1.05 in greenbacks. Once the public was confident that they could redeem greenbacks for gold, few <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were redeemed. Greenbacks were now at parity with gold dollars, and the nation had, {{for the first time since}} the Civil War, a unified monetary system.|$|E

5|$|Well {{before the}} design was finalised, four ships were ordered in July 1943. Africa was {{originally}} ordered as an unnamed Audacious-class carrier, but {{the order was}} modified to a Malta-class ship on 12 July 1943. Malta, New Zealand and Gibraltar were all ordered three days later. New Zealand was originally ordered from Cammell Laird, but the contract was transferred to Harland and Wolff on 22 July 1944. The Admiralty ordered Vickers not to order any more material on 27 April 1944 and given that final drawings were never issued to the builders, {{it is unlikely that}} any of them <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> more than preliminary work. None of the ships were ever laid down and all of them were cancelled before the end of 1945.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kenna is tied as the third-most intense Pacific {{hurricane}} {{to strike}} {{the west coast of}} Mexico in recorded history. Kenna was the sixteenth tropical depression, thirteenth tropical storm, seventh hurricane, sixth major hurricane, and third Category 5 hurricane of the 2002 Pacific hurricane season. After forming on October 22 to the south of Mexico from a tropical wave, forecasters consistently predicted the storm to strengthen much less than it <b>actually</b> <b>did.</b> Moving into an area of favorable upper-level conditions and warm sea surface temperatures, Kenna quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on October 25 while located about 255mi (410km) southwest of Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. Weakening as it turned to the northeast, the hurricane struck near San Blas, Nayarit, with winds of 140mph (225km/h) before dissipating on October 26 over the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains.|$|E
5|$|The limited {{scope of}} the Instruments of Accession {{and the promise of}} a wide-ranging {{autonomy}} and the other guarantees they offered, gave sufficient comfort to many rulers, who saw this as the best deal they could strike given the lack of support from the British, and popular internal pressures. Between May 1947 and the transfer of power on 15 August 1947, the vast majority of states signed Instruments of Accession. A few, however, held out. Some simply delayed signing the Instrument of Accession. Piploda, a small state in central India, did not accede until March 1948. The biggest problems, however, arose with a few border states, such as Jodhpur, which tried to negotiate better deals with Pakistan, with Junagadh, which <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> accede to Pakistan, and with Hyderabad and Kashmir, which declared that they intended to remain independent.|$|E

5|$|While visiting Ghana in 1960, Du Bois {{spoke with}} its {{president}} about {{the creation of}} a new encyclopedia of the African diaspora, the Encyclopedia Africana. In early 1961, Ghana notified Du Bois that they had appropriated funds to support the encyclopedia project, and they invited Du Bois to come to Ghana and manage the project there. In October 1961, at the age of 93, Du Bois and his wife traveled to Ghana to take up residence and commence work on the encyclopedia. In early 1963, the United States refused to renew his passport, so he made the symbolic gesture of becoming a citizen of Ghana. While it is sometimes stated that he renounced his U.S. citizenship at that time, and he did state his intention to do so, Du Bois never <b>actually</b> <b>did.</b> His health declined during the two years he was in Ghana, and he died on August 27, 1963, in the capital of Accra at the age of 95. Du Bois was buried in Accra near his home, which is now the Du Bois Memorial Centre. A day after his death, at the March on Washington, speaker Roy Wilkins asked the hundreds of thousands of marchers to honor Du Bois with a moment of silence. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, embodying many of the reforms Du Bois had campaigned for his entire life, was enacted almost a year after his death.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hill led {{the rest}} of the battalion, {{approximately}} 525 strong, in some commandeered trucks towards the town of Béja, an important road and railway centre approximately forty miles from the airfield. The battalion arrived at approximately 18:00 and was welcomed by the local French garrison, 3,000 strong, which Hill persuaded to cooperate with the paratroopers; in order to give the garrison and any German observers the impression that he possessed a larger force than he <b>actually</b> <b>did,</b> Hill arranged for the battalion to march through the town several times, wearing different headgear and holding different equipment each time. A short time after the battalion entered Béja, German aircraft arrived and bombed the town, although they caused little damage and no casualties. The next day, 'S' Company was sent with a detachment of engineers to the village of Sidi N'Sir, about twenty miles away; they were to contact the local French forces, believed to be proBritish, and harass German forces. The detachment found the village and made contact with the French, who allowed them to pass through towards the town of Mateur; by nightfall the force had not reached the town, and decided to encamp for the night. At dawn a German convoy of armoured cars passed the detachment, and it was decided to set an ambush for the convoy if it returned, with anti-tank mines being laid on the road and a mortar and Bren guns being set up in concealed positions. When the convoy returned at approximately 10:00 the leading vehicle struck a mine and exploded, blocking the road, and the other vehicles were disabled with mortar fire, Gammon bombs and the remaining antitank mines. A number of Germans were killed and the rest taken prisoner, with two paratroopers being slightly wounded. The detachment returned to Béja with prisoners and several slightly damaged armoured cars. After the success of the ambush, Hill sent a second patrol to harass local German forces, but it was withdrawn after it encountered a larger German force that inflicted several British casualties; Béja was also bombed by Stuka divebombers, inflicting civilian casualties and destroying a number of houses.|$|E
