5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If you saw her in the street, you'd think: {{she looks like a}} girl who looks a bit like Madonna.|$|E
5|$|The Point {{was formed}} by {{longshore}} drift and this movement continues westward; the spit lengthened by 132.1m (433ft) between 1886 and 1925. At the western end, the shingle curves south towards the mainland. This feature has developed several times over the years, giving the impression from the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of hooks along {{the south side of}} the spit. Salt marshes have formed between the shingle curves and in front of the coasts sheltered by the spit, and sand dunes have accumulated at the Point's western end. Some of the shorter side ridges meet the main ridge at a steep angle due to the southward movement of the latter. There is an area of reclaimed farmland, known as Blakeney Freshes, to the west of Cley Beach Road.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of the house, now has the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E
25|$|The {{producer}} initially sought actor Richard Griffiths {{to succeed}} Baker, {{but when he}} proved unavailable, cast Peter Davison, {{with whom he had}} previously worked on the popular drama series All Creatures Great and Small. Davison was very different from his four predecessors, being much younger, in line with Nathan-Turner's desire for the Fifth Doctor to be completely unlike the popular Fourth, so that the public would not draw unfavourable comparisons between the two. Davison's Doctor was arguably the most human of them all, and the one whose vulnerability was emphasised the most. The Fifth Doctor, more often than not, reacted to circumstances around him rather than being proactive, and had the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young aristocrat about him, in contrast to Baker's bohemian personality.|$|E
500|$|Longfellow was {{the most}} popular poet of his day. [...] As a friend once wrote, [...] "no other poet was so fully {{recognized}} in his lifetime". Many of his works helped shape the American character and its legacy, particularly with the poem [...] "Paul Revere's Ride". He was such an admired figure in the United States during his life that his 70th birthday in 1877 took on the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> national holiday, with parades, speeches, and the reading of his poetry.|$|E

500|$|At a {{state dinner}} given by Pierce, Benjamin first met Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, whose wife Varina {{described}} the Louisiana senator as having [...] "rather the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> witty bon vivant than {{of a great}} senator". The two men, both ambitious for leadership in the South and the nation, formed a relationship that Evans describes as [...] "respectful but wary". The two had occasional differences; when in 1858, Davis, by then a Mississippi senator, was irritated by Benjamin's questioning him on a military bill and suggested that Benjamin was acting as a paid attorney, the Louisianan challenged him to a duel. Davis apologized.|$|E
500|$|Harry Thompson {{felt that}} Hergé's use of various {{characters}} from earlier stories lent Tintin and the Picaros [...] "the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finale". Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters felt {{that in this}} story, the characters were [...] "more passive than in the earlier adventures, submitting to events more than setting them off", with this being particularly evident for the character of Tintin. Michael Farr stated that [...] "Tintin has changed", as {{is evidenced by the}} change in his clothing, however he felt that [...] "such image modernising only succeeds in dating the adventure", adding that [...] "to alter Tintin's appearance {{at the end of his}} career was not only superfluous but a mistake".|$|E
500|$|In 1857, the Beirut-based {{governor}} of Sidon Eyalet agreed to Shamdin's request to eliminate Aqil, who, {{to the consternation of}} the Ottoman authorities, was ruling the Galilee autonomously by that time. Shamdin, who sought vengeance against Aqil for terminating his service in Galilee, had {{complained to the}} Sidon governor that Aqil was committing treachery by collaborating with the Bedouin tribes against Ottoman authority. The Ottomans, whose dependence on Aqil had decreased {{with the end of the}} Crimean War in 1856, found in Shamdin's request a convenient way to end Aqil's growing autonomy. When Aqil visited Beirut to pay his respects to the {{governor of}} Sidon, he traveled with [...] "the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sultan", according to the American missionary Henry H. Jessup, bringing with him a large and heavily armed Bedouin entourage.|$|E

500|$|Film theorist Wheeler Winston Dixon, {{far from}} decrying the series for its {{production}} values, finds that [...] "the copious [...] stock footage and the numerous exterior sequences {{shot in the}} ruins of the bombed-out metropolis give Flash Gordon a [...] distinctly ravaged look". He writes that its international origins give the series [...] "an interesting new cultural dimension, even a perceptible <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> split cultural identity". [...] Dixon quotes German cultural historian Mark Baker, who writes of a particular scene from the episode The Brain Machine as emblematic of this cultural split. The scene uses stock footage of a June 17, 1953 demonstration by East Berlin workers against the East German government. Soviet tanks opened fire on both demonstrators and bystanders, thus confirming East Germany's status as a Soviet puppet state in the minds of West Germans. American viewers, Baker speculates, were probably unaware of the iconic power in West Germany of the images of fleeing East Berlinners, which were used to illustrate a panic on Neptune.|$|E
500|$|Helen Faucit was critiqued by Henry Morley, a {{professor}} of English literature in University College, London, who thought the actress [...] "too demonstrative and noisy" [...] in the scenes before Duncan's murder with the [...] "Come, you spirits" [...] speech [...] "simply spouted" [...] and its closing [...] "Hold! Hold!" [...] shouted in a [...] "most unheavenly manner." [...] In the [...] "I have given suck" [...] speech, he thought Faucit [...] "poured out" [...] the speech {{in a way that}} recalled the [...] "scold at the door of a gin-shop." [...] Faucit, he believed, was [...] "too essentially feminine, too exclusively gifted with the art of expressing all that is most beautiful and graceful in womanhood, to succeed in inspiring anything like awe and terror." [...] He thought her talents more congenial to {{the second phase of the}} character, and found her [...] "admirably good" [...] in the banquet scene. Her sleepwalking scene, however, was described as having [...] "the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> too well-studied dramatic recitation." ...|$|E
500|$|Bacon's {{relationships}} {{prior to}} Dyer {{had all been}} with older men who were as tumultuous in temperament as the artist himself, but each had been the dominating presence. Peter Lacy, his first lover, would often tear up the young artist's paintings, beat him up in drunken rages, and leave {{him on the street}} half-conscious. Bacon was attracted to Dyer's vulnerability and trusting nature. Dyer was impressed by Bacon's self-confidence and his artistic success, and Bacon acted as a protector and father figure to the insecure younger man. Dyer was, like Bacon, a borderline alcoholic and similarly took obsessive care with his appearance. Pale-faced and a chain-smoker, Dyer typically confronted his daily hangovers by drinking again. His compact and athletic build belied a docile and inwardly tortured personality; the art critic Michael Peppiatt described him as having the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man who could [...] "land a decisive punch". Their behaviours eventually overwhelmed their affair, and by 1970, Bacon was merely providing Dyer with enough money to stay more or less permanently drunk.|$|E

500|$|Writer's {{assistant}} Karen Wilkie {{can be seen}} in {{the audience}} during Seinfeld's stand-up comedy act. Nurit Koppel portrayed Rava, at the time she was known for her appearance in the CBS television movie Sweet Bird of Youth (1989) as well as a guest appearance on the NBC crime drama Hunter. Jane Leeves, who would later appear as Marla the Virgin in season four and season nine also auditioned for the part, she also went on to star in the popular NBC sitcom Frasier (1993–2004). In the script, Ray Thomas' description was, [...] "although he carries cleaning equipment, he also carries the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pretentious mannerly, affected actor". Various actors auditioned for the part, among which were Hank Azaria, Michael D. Conway and Tony Shalhoub, who had also auditioned for the part of Kramer. Conway was eventually cast for the part. Norman Brenner, who worked as Richards' stand-in on the show for all its nine seasons, appears as an extra; he appears in the background when Jerry and Ray talk at Monk's Cafe.|$|E
500|$|A further development, {{known as}} Hazel Court (after Alfred Hazel, {{principal}} 1925–1944), {{was built in}} 2000, bringing {{the total number of}} students who can be housed at the sports ground to 135. Writing in the Royal Institute of British Architects Journal in 2002, Jeremy Melvin praised the architects of Hazel Court, Maguire & Co., for their [...] "crispness of detail" [...] and [...] "richness of composition"; he said that [...] "the sense of ordered space... recalls {{the way in which the}} traditional collegiate quads gave architectural expression to the then-new idea of a university". He noted that, whilst the first impression of the houses was Elizabethan with the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> courtyard garden, [...] "closer inspection reveals a contemporary design sensibility"; there was, he wrote, [...] "the impression of an order that comes from making the construction explicit whils combining sensitivity to function and use". However, he commented that whilst there was plenty of space inside, the furniture [...] "would not look out of place in a motorway hotel".|$|E
500|$|... "From a View to a Kill" [...] was {{initially}} {{intended to be}} the backstory for Hugo Drax, the villain of the novel Moonraker. The story would have taken place during World War II, and featured Drax as the motorcycle assassin who crashes his bike and is taken to an American field hospital. Later, the hospital is bombed, leaving Drax with amnesia and a disfigured face. The story was one that Fleming had drawn up for the television series. The SHAPE head of security, Colonel Schreiber, {{was designed to be}} the antithesis of Bond, with greying hair, the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bank manager, desk with silver framed photographs of his family and a single white rose; the description shows Fleming using colour to show Schreiber's lack of colour and personality. The idea of the underground hideout was inspired by Fleming's brother Peter's band of Auxiliary Units who dug tunnel networks in Britain in 1940 as part of a resistance movement in advance of a German invasion. The original name for the story was [...] "The Rough with the Smooth", which was also the original title of the books, before For Your Eyes Only was chosen for publication.|$|E

500|$|In exile Rosas was not destitute, but {{he lived}} {{modestly}} amid financial constraints during {{the remainder of}} his life. A very few loyal friends sent him money, but it was never enough. He sold one of his estancias before the confiscation and became a tenant farmer in Swaythling, near Southampton. He employed a housekeeper and two to four laborers, to whom he paid above-average wages. Despite constant concern over his shortage of funds, Rosas found joy in farm life, once remarking: [...] "I now consider myself happy on this farm, living in modest circumstances as you see, earning a living the hard way by the sweat of my brow". A contemporary described him in final years: [...] "He was then eighty, a man still handsome and imposing; his manners were most refined, and the modest environment did nothing to lessen his <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> great lord, inherited from his family." [...] After a walk on a cold day, Rosas caught pneumonia and died at 07:00 on the morning of 14 March 1877. Following a private mass attended by his family and a few friends, he was buried in the town cemetery of Southampton.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} episode, Lieberstein said {{he sought to}} appeal to {{newcomers}} to the series and attract them to the show, without alienating regular The Office watchers: [...] "We {{wanted to do a}} stand-alone comedy episode that could bring people in." [...] Lieberstein said the script drew less attention to long-standing story arcs, which new viewers would not understand. Lieberstein said, [...] "It almost had an <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pilot in a way, where we had to reintroduce everything. We wanted it to be extremely funny and extremely funny up front." [...] The Office creator Greg Daniels said he felt the episode had to focus on physical comedy and easily accessible set pieces. Daniels said, [...] "I looked at all the shows that followed the Super Bowl in years past and I feel that a comedy would be a good choice in the current climate. People want to laugh so we're trying our best to supply some laughs." [...] Actor Rainn Wilson said of the episode, [...] "It's a great opportunity for people to revisit the world of The Office and hopefully get into our style of comedy." ...|$|E
500|$|Lambert {{shared his}} {{interests}} {{and knowledge of}} sports, dogs and animal husbandry with London's middle and upper classes, and it soon became highly fashionable to visit him, or become his friend. Many called repeatedly; one banker made 20visits, paying the admission fee on each occasion. During this period of English history no real stigma was attached to obesity, and Lambert was generally considered a wonder to be marvelled at, rather than a freak to be gawped or sneered at. His business venture was immediately successful, drawing around 400paying visitors per day. His home was described as having the <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fashionable resort, rather than that of an exhibition, and he was pleased to find that his customers generally treated him with courtesy, and not simply as a spectacle. He insisted on maintaining amongst his visitors an atmosphere of civility and all men entering his rooms were obliged to remove their hats. One visitor refused to remove his [...] "even if the King were present" [...] but Lambert replied that [...] "Then by G——, Sir, you must instantly quit this room, as I do not consider it a mark of respect due to myself, but to the ladies and gentlemen who honor me with their company." ...|$|E
