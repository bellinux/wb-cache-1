These pigments were used for dyeing and printing calico and other textiles.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>raw</b> 3D {{model of}} Jacob's wolf {{was the basis}} for {{creating}} the others. A muscle system, which gave the appearance of muscles firing and flexing, contributed to this model. From there, the initial fur layout went to painters who were responsible for its color and groom. They also added characteristics, such as wet hair clumping together, and applied it to the fur. They refined this look before passing it off to the lighting and technical directors.|$|E

5|$|For Reyner Banham, Tange was a prime {{exemplar of}} the use of Brutalist architecture. His use of Béton brut {{concrete}} finishes in <b>a</b> <b>raw</b> and undecorated way combined with his civic projects such as the redevelopment of Tokyo Bay made him a great influence on British architects during the 1960s. Brutalist architecture has been criticised for being soulless and for promoting the exclusive use of a material that is poor at withstanding long exposures to natural weather.|$|E
50|$|Sizarr use {{a mixture}} of guitars, drums, synthesisers, loops and samples to create a post-punk sound. Deaf Sty's vocals are {{reminiscent}} of James Blake and Jeff Buckley, but have <b>a</b> <b>rawer</b> rasp like that of Hamilton Leithauser from The Walkmen.|$|R
50|$|After heavy touring {{throughout}} 2005 with The Bad Seeds {{in support}} of Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus, Nick Cave began writing songs on guitar, an instrument he'd rarely played.

5|$|He {{preferred}} {{raw meat}} to cooked; while his favourite dish was <b>a</b> <b>raw</b> bullock's liver, he would eat any available meat.

5|$|Heating {{oil shale}} to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature causes the chemical process of pyrolysis {{to yield a}} vapor. Upon cooling the vapor, the liquid shale oil—an unconventional oil—is separated from combustible oil-shale gas (the term shale gas can also refer to gas occurring naturally in shales). Oil shale can also be burned directly in furnaces as a low-grade fuel for power generation and district heating or used as <b>a</b> <b>raw</b> material in chemical and construction-materials processing.|$|E
5|$|Plant recolonization and {{succession}} {{has occurred}} in Glacier Bay {{as a result of}} the retreat of the glacier bay in the last about 300 years. The succession, which occurred in the new wilderness of Glacier Bay was stated to be <b>a</b> <b>raw</b> landscape. A simile given is that “It was like seeing an owl with no feathers”. A vegetative wilderness has been created, which has resulted in the coastal forest. 333 Vascular plant species of individual taxa have been recorded in the Glacier Bay. Dense thickets of Sitka alder and devil's club abound along the shoreline.|$|E

5|$|Powerviolence is <b>a</b> <b>raw</b> and dissonant subgenre of {{hardcore}} punk. The {{style is}} closely related to thrashcore and similar to grindcore. While powerviolence took inspiration from Napalm Death and other early grind bands, powerviolence groups avoided elements of heavy metal. Its nascent form was pioneered in the late 1980s in the music of hardcore punk band Infest, who mixed youth crew hardcore elements with noisier, sludgier qualities of Lärm and Siege. The microgenre solidified into its most commonly recognized form in the early 1990s, with the sounds of bands such as Man Is the Bastard, Crossed Out, No Comment, Capitalist Casualties, and Manpig.|$|E
5|$|Snake scales {{occur as}} a motif {{regularly}} in computer action games. A snake scale was portrayed as a clue in the 1982 film Blade Runner.

50|$|There is a {{consensus}} that this 'independent' period was when the title had <b>a</b> <b>rawer</b> and radical edge than under its later ownership. Its political stories caused consternation and complaints - there were numerous spats with councils, quangos and occasionally blank spaces where legal injunctions had caused stories to be pulled just prior to printing.|$|R
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>raw</b> {{material}} prices {{fall through}} the global recession, the negotiating position of African countries is sharply weakened, while expected profits intended to repay Chinese loans are collapsing. As a consequence, tensions have increased: China is more worried {{about the risk of}} default, while African countries fear servicing their debt over the long term of their loans.|$|R
50|$|Fontana's {{style has}} been defined as <b>a</b> bit <b>raw,</b> <b>a</b> bit scarred, and a bit anti-establishment. While his work may look spontaneous, every detail is {{carefully}} planned, resulting in an image with attention paid to every aspect from the lighting to the outfit.|$|R
5|$|The band entered Music Box Studios in Los Angeles with Gordon and Fleming in March 1991, {{and worked}} on the album for one week; the songs were {{recorded}} {{over a period of}} four days, and were mixed {{over the course of a}} further three days. During the recording sessions for the album, Love purportedly gargled whiskey and excessively smoked cigarettes before takes to give <b>a</b> <b>raw</b> edge to her vocals.|$|E
5|$|These were {{difficulties}} {{which seemed}} rather {{to require the}} superior force of a Wycherley, or a Congreve, than of <b>a</b> <b>raw</b> and unexperienced pen; for I believe I may boast that none ever appeared so early upon the stage. However, such was the candour of the audience, the play was received with greater satisfaction than I should have promised myself from its merit, had it even preceded the Provoked Husband.|$|E
5|$|When the WWF {{was renamed}} World Wrestling Entertainment and {{divided into two}} Raw and SmackDown brands, Holly was {{assigned}} to the Raw roster, where he had little success.

Earlier, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff was informed that <b>a</b> <b>Raw</b> wrestler would leave to reunite with a relative on SmackDown!, and ordered a beatdown on Hardy, who he wrongly suspected of planning to join his brother, Matt Hardy.|$|E

Hall was utilized mainly in a backup role throughout the next few months, teaming with Melina, as well as competing in a 12 wrestler tag team match at the Backlash pay-per-view in April, which her team won. In mid-2008, Hall began a scripted rivalry with Mickie James and Kelly Kelly, teaming up with multiple partners, including Layla and Katie Lea Burchill to face them in tag team matches.

In addition, McCartney hoped to realise his longstanding plan of making a film adaptation of the Rupert the Bear cartoon series, for which he owned the commercial rights, and commissioned English playwright Willy Russell to write a feature film starring Wings.|$|E
5|$|Himalayan salt is Pakistan's {{best known}} rock salt. It {{is used for}} cooking, as bath salt, as brine and as <b>a</b> <b>raw</b> {{material}} for many industries, including a soda ash plant set up by AkzoNobel in 1940. Salt from Khewra mine {{is also used to}} make decorative items like lamps, vases, ashtrays and statues, which are exported to the United States, India and many European countries. The use of rock salt to make artistic and decorative items started during the Mughal era, when many craftsman made tableware and decorations from it. Warth introduced the use of a lathe to cut out art pieces from the rock salt, as he found it similar to gypsum in physical characteristics.|$|E
