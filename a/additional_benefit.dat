5|$|Various analgesics (painkillers) {{may be used}} in {{controlling}} the headaches of intracranial hypertension. In addition to conventional agents such as paracetamol, a low dose of the antidepressant amitriptyline or the anticonvulsant topiramate have shown some <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> for pain relief.|$|E
5|$|Male {{condoms and}} the {{diaphragm}} with spermicide have typical use first-year failure rates of 18% and 12%, respectively. With perfect use condoms {{are more effective}} with a 2% first-year failure rate versus a 6% first-year rate with the diaphragm. Condoms have the <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> of helping {{to prevent the spread}} of some sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Rafting is also {{popular in}} some of the Canadian {{stretches}} of the river, especially those near the headwaters that have the steepest gradient and the most challenging rapids. Several Canadian outfitters provide trips on the river near Kootenay National Park ranging from a few hours to several days. Canoeing in the numerous sloughs, side-channels and distributaries of the Kootenay that thread through the wetlands of the Kootenay Flats has the <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> of watching birds and wildlife in the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Unit and other surrounding marshes. Larger craft such as houseboats are able to travel on Kootenay and Koocanusa Lakes. Rafting and kayaking is also an activity on the swift-flowing Slocan River, the lowermost major tributary of the Kootenay, and in parts of other major Kootenay tributaries as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{experiment}} {{had previously}} been considered, but rejected, by Isaac Newton as a practical demonstration of his theory of gravitation. However, a team of scientists, notably Nevil Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, {{was convinced that the}} effect would be detectable and undertook to conduct the experiment. The deflection angle depended on the relative densities and volumes of the Earth and the mountain: if the density and volume of Schiehallion could be ascertained, then so could the density of the Earth. Once this was known, then this would in turn yield approximate values for those of the other planets, their moons, and the Sun, previously known only in terms of their relative ratios. As an <b>additional</b> <b>benefit,</b> the concept of contour lines, devised to simplify the process of surveying the mountain, later became a standard technique in cartography.|$|E
25|$|Oophorectomy can {{significantly}} improve survival {{for women with}} high-risk BRCA mutations, for whom prophylactic oophorectomy around age 40 {{reduces the risk of}} ovarian and breast cancer and provides significant and substantial long-term survival advantage.

25|$|This {{political}} maneuver, {{in addition}} to helping return Andrew Devold to the Minnesota Senate, had the <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> of temporarily boosting circulation figures, with the paper managing to briefly match its pre-war press run.

25|$|The {{technique}} {{is also important}} in possibly preventing insufflation of gas into the stomach. A study concluded that appropriate application of cricoid pressure prevents gastric gas insufflation during airway management via mask up to 40cm H2O PIP in infants and children. An <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> of cricoid pressure occurs in paralyzed patients in whom gastric insufflation occurs at lower inflation pressures.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{involves}} a diet which includes an adequate amount of riboflavin containing foods. Multi-vitamin and mineral dietary supplements often contain 100% of the Daily Value (1.3 mg) for riboflavin, {{and can be}} used by persons concerned about an inadequate diet. Over-the-counter dietary supplements are available in the United States with doses as high as 100mg, but {{there is no evidence that}} these high doses have any <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> for healthy people.|$|E
25|$|Where {{intrusive}} underwater excavation is appropriate, silts and sediments can {{be removed}} from an area of investigation using a water dredge or airlift. When used correctly, these devices have an <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> in tending to improve the visibility {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the investigation. It is also important to note that for very deep sea excavation submarines are sometimes used to view sites. Underwater photography can also be conducted from these submarines which assists the recording process.|$|E

Corticosteroids {{have been found}} to improve outcomes, while antiviral medications may be of a small <b>additional</b> <b>benefit.</b> The eye should be protected from drying up with the use of eye drops or an eyepatch. Surgery is generally not recommended. Often signs of improvement begin within 14 days, with complete recovery within six months. A few may not recover completely or have a recurrence of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from special}} occasions, the city's ice boats were usually only {{employed}} {{for two or}} three months of the yearthrough the winter months of December/January through February/Marchbeing laid up for repair or refit the rest of the year.

25|$|It {{follows that}} the most {{effective}} field placements for aggressive fast bowling are to pack the outfield and the slips cordon and gully since these are the positions in which the batsman {{is most likely to}} be caught. Placing fielders in the outfield has the <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> of limiting the number of places where a batsman can score a boundary. Other close fielding positions such as silly mid on/off and the various midwicket and cover positions are generally redundant.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally {{draught beer}} came from wooden barrels, also called casks. In the 1950s these {{began to be}} {{replaced}} by metal casks of stainless steel or aluminium, mainly for quality reasons as they could be sterilised and the beer was therefore less likely to spoil, but also for economic reasons. An <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> of the switch to metal casks was that staling from oxygen in the air could be reduced. Subsequently, in the early 1960s a form of metal cask, known as a keg, was introduced which allowed for more efficient cleaning and filling in the brewery.|$|E
25|$|Altered {{fractionation}} schemes, such as RTOG 9003 and RTOG 0129 {{have not}} conferred <b>additional</b> <b>benefit.</b> Radiation dose recommendations were largely determined empirically in clinical studies with few HPV+OPC patients, and have remained unchanged {{for half a}} century, {{making it difficult to}} determine the optimum dose for this subgroup. A common approach uses 70Gy bilaterally and anteriorly, such as RTOG 9003 (1991–1997) and RTOG 0129 (2002–2005). For lateralized tonsil cancer unilateral neck radiation is usually prescribed, but for tongue base primaries bilateral neck radiation is more common, but unilateral radiation may be used where tongue base lesions are lateralised.|$|E

25|$|In June 2011, the State Government {{announced}} that the new stadium would be built on the northern section of the Burswood Park golf course.

It would also allow for a special events six-platform Stadium railway station to be built and could {{be connected to the}} CBD via a pedestrian bridge across the Swan River to East Perth.

25|$|For {{most people}} with CLL, it is incurable by present {{treatment}}s, so treatment is directed towards suppressing the disease for many years, rather than totally and permanently eliminating it. The primary chemotherapeutic plan is combination chemotherapy with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide, plus a corticosteroid such as prednisone or prednisolone. The use of a corticosteroid has the <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> of suppressing some related autoimmune diseases, such as immunohemolytic anemia or immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. In resistant cases, single-agent treatments with nucleoside drugs such as fludarabine, pentostatin, or cladribine may be successful. Younger and healthier patients may choose allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation {{in the hope of}} a permanent cure.|$|E
25|$|The Vampire III, was {{the first}} of several models that sought to address the demands for greater range from the type. Accordingly, underwing fuel tanks of both 100 and 200 gallon capacities; other {{modifications}} included the lowering of the tailplane and the reshaping of the vertical surfaces of the tail. The design changes to accommodate hardpoint-mounted drop tanks had the <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> of enabling the carriage of various stores and had effectively readied the type for performing ground-attack duties. The wing was considerably modified to improve low altitude performance, the span having been reduced by 2ft, the adoption of square-cut wingtips, the thickening of the skin, greater structural strength, and undercarriage modifications to withstand the overall increased weight.|$|E
