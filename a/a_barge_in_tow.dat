50|$|On 16 October, McFarland was {{unloading}} cargo and embarking wounded personnel in Lunga Roads {{when she was}} attacked by nine dive bombers. While the first seven scored no hits, the eighth hit <b>a</b> gasoline <b>barge</b> <b>in</b> <b>tow</b> alongside the tender’s starboard quarter. The blazing barge was cut loose as the ninth plane made its run. At least one bomb hit McFarlands stern, knocking out her rudder and steering engine. Her crew shot down one plane, but lost eleven of its members in the fight; five killed, six missing, with an additional 12 critically wounded. For this action, the ship was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.|$|R
50|$|In mid-June, the tug moved {{south to}} search the Florida Strait for the {{submarine}} R-12 (SS-89), which had sunk {{as a result of}} battery explosions. After fruitlessly seeking this ship from 18 to 23 June, Arapaho set sail on 25 June—apparently from Key West, Florida—with <b>a</b> <b>barge</b> <b>in</b> <b>tow</b> on her way to Panama. She left the barge in the Panama Canal Zone and continued her voyage to San Diego, California, where she arrived on 15 July.|$|E
50|$|Following {{her return}} to the atoll, Anaqua {{assisted}} in closing down the large fleet anchorage at Ulithi. The vessel helped remove 20 mi of anti-torpedo net. This salvage work was completed by 17 October, when she headed home with <b>a</b> <b>barge</b> <b>in</b> <b>tow.</b> The ship paused at Saipan to unload nets being transported by the barge and then proceeded to Hawaii. During this passage, rough seas and inclement weather slowed her progress, and Anaqua headed for Midway Islands to refuel. The vessel finally reached Pearl Harbor on 12 November.|$|E
50|$|Following {{shakedown}} in Chesapeake Bay, Seginus {{proceeded to}} Hawaii with general cargo and foodstuffs for Pearl Harbor. Arriving on 29 August 1944, she took on armor plate from the battleship , {{carried it to}} Bremerton, Washington; then loaded lumber and small craft and took <b>a</b> <b>barge</b> <b>in</b> <b>tow</b> for the return voyage to Pearl Harbor. She arrived in mid-October and, {{for the remainder of}} World War II, continued to shuttle cargo between the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii with only two interruptions: two runs to the Marshalls and Marianas in April and in June and July 1945.|$|E

The launch got within two or three lengths of the skiff, and as the brothers Dessaix saw that she was not altering her course, Peter Dessaix called out, 'Look out! Alter your course, or we will be run down.' At this time, so the brothers say, there was no one at the wheel of the Kate. Again and again Peter yelled out, and then someone rushed to the wheel, and attempted to alter the course ...|$|R

When Japanese aircraft swept over Oahu, Vega went to general quarters, opening fire with her anti-aircraft guns, as civilian stevedores continued the arduous job of unloading her dangerous cargo. Since the Japanese were after bigger game, the [...] "Hog Islander" [...] and her vital cargo {{emerged from the}} attack unscathed.|$|R
25|$|After {{the gold}} rush the A. J. Goddard spent much of its time <b>in</b> the <b>towing</b> {{business}} on Lake Laberge. In 1899 the company behind her was sold to a competitor, the Canadian Development Company, which appears to have confined the vessel’s service between Whitehorse and {{the foot of the}} Thirty Mile River. On October 11, the A. J. Goddard entered Lake Laberge with <b>a</b> large <b>barge</b> <b>in</b> <b>tow.</b> Here she sank during a storm. The little ship was blasted with freezing rain and snow and pounded by waves. Despite the crew’s efforts, she began to take on water, which extinguished the boiler fires and left the ship without power. She sank to the lake bottom only a few hundred metres from shore. Three of the crew, Charles MacDonald, Fay Ransom and John Thompson, drowned while two were rescued by a local trapper in a rowboat.|$|R
50|$|Grenadiers fifth war patrol, {{under the}} command of LCDR John Allison Fitzgerald, between 1 January and 20 February 1943, brought her {{considerably}} better fortune than earlier patrols. A 75-ton schooner fell victim to her deck guns 10 January, and two days later Grenadier sighted a small tanker with <b>a</b> <b>barge</b> <b>in</b> <b>tow.</b> Judging the target not worth a torpedo, she slipped silently into the column behind the two Japanese ships. At dusk she battle surfaced. With binoculars lashed to the deck guns as sights, she raked the tanker and barge, sinking them immediately. The remainder of her patrol, along the Borneo coast through shallow and treacherous waters, was hampered by fathometer failures. She conducted an aggressive attack on two cargo ships 22 January but did not sink them.|$|E
5000|$|... 7 December 1941: Prior to {{the onset}} of the Attack on Pearl Harbor the {{squadron}} had launched three aircraft for routine patrol. Squadron aircraft 14-P-1, ﬂown by Ensign William P. Tanner, spotted a Japanese midget submarine {{at the entrance to the}} harbor and assisted [...] in sinking the intruder. The Japanese plan had been to drop off the midget submarines 5 mi to 10 mi from Pearl Harbor, passing through the entrance to the harbor 20 minutes before sunrise. They were to surface when the air attack began, shoot both torpedoes and then depart the harbor. Lieutenant Naoji Iwasa, whose midget submarine had been released by I-22, was sunk by Ward and Ensign Tanner. Iwasa had tried to follow the tug Antares through the harbor entrance while Antares had <b>a</b> <b>barge</b> <b>in</b> <b>tow.</b> During the attack on Pearl Harbor seven of the squadron’s aircraft were destroyed on the ground and three were badly damaged. While surprised by the attack, ground crews strove to save their aircraft, pulling them from burning hangars. Despite his wounds, Aviation Ordnance Chief John W. Finn was credited with shooting down an attacking Japanese aircraft, one of the three shot down at NAS Kaneohe Bay that day. He was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery under ﬁre and for leading the efforts to save the remaining squadron aircraft.|$|E
40|$|The "Marita" {{was built}} for the British Admiralty as a mine sweeper and a sub chaser in 1918. She was 172 feet in length and of 629 gross tons. During her history, she was owned by six {{different}} countries. Names include "Kilmacrennan," "Seghill," "Kaspar," and "Tela. " In 1929, the vessel was purchased by the General Transit Company of Cleveland, Ohio. A short time later, she was purchased by the Copper Steamship Company of Cleveland. She plied the waters from Cleveland to Detroit and Monroe, Michigan with the former Anchor Line Steamer "India," (then <b>a</b> <b>barge)</b> <b>in</b> <b>tow.</b> The "Marita," transported scrap iron and steel. During World War II, the vessel was purchased by the U. S. government and used in the Gulf of Mexico as a training ship for gunners for duty on merchant ships. In 1948, she was sold to the Tropical Navigation Company of Ecuador, where she was dismantled in 1964...|$|E
