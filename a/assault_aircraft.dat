5|$|In early 1968, the Soviet Ministry of Defence {{decided to}} develop a {{specialised}} shturmovik armoured <b>assault</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{in order to provide}} close air support for the Soviet Ground Forces. The idea of creating a ground-support aircraft came about after analysing the experience of ground-attack (shturmovaya) aviation during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The Soviet fighter-bombers in service or under development at the time (Su-7, Su-17, MiG-21 and MiG-23) did not meet the requirements for close air support of the army. They lacked essential armour plating to protect the pilot and vital equipment from ground fire and missile hits, and their high flight speeds made it difficult for the pilot to maintain visual contact with a target. Having taken into account these problems, Pavel Sukhoi and a group of leading specialists in the Sukhoi Design Bureau started preliminary design work in a comparatively short period of time, with the assistance of leading institutes of the Ministry of the Aviation Industry and the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
2500|$|The British began a [...] "desultory bombardment" [...] on 31 August {{and also}} sought to neutralise the German {{artillery}} with gas before the attack, including gas bombardments on the three evenings before the <b>assault.</b> <b>Aircraft</b> were reserved for systematic counter-attack reconnaissance, to avoid the failures of previous battles, where too few aircraft had been burdened with too many duties, in bad weather. The three-week pause originated from lieutenant-generals T. Morland and W. Birdwood, the X and I Anzac corps commanders, at a conference of 27 August. The attacking corps made their plans {{within the framework of}} the Second Army plan, using General Principles on Which the Artillery Plan Will be Drawn of 29 August, which described the multi-layered creeping barrage and the use of Fuze 106, to avoid adding more craters to the ground. The Second Army and both corps did visibility tests to decide when zero hour should be set; the use of wireless and gun-carrying tanks, were discussed with Plumer on 15 September. X Corps issued its first Instruction on 1 September, giving times and boundaries to its divisions.|$|E

5000|$|The Kawasaki Ki-102 (Army Type 4 <b>assault</b> <b>aircraft)</b> was a Japanese warplane of World War II. It was a twin-engine, two-seat, {{long-range}} heavy fighter {{developed to}} replace the Ki-45 Toryu. Three versions were planned: the Ki-102a day fighter, Ki-102b ground-attack and Ki-102c night fighter. This aircraft's Allied reporting name was [...] "Randy".|$|E

In the assault transport role, it was to be mostly used to haul heavy equipment instead of troops.|$|R
2500|$|In December 1951, OKB-153 {{initiated}} {{the design of}} a twin-engined <b>assault</b> transport <b>aircraft,</b> designated DT-5/8 (Desahntno-Trahnsportnyy [...] – <b>assault</b> transport <b>aircraft),</b> to be powered by two Kuznetsov TV-2 turboprop engines, and fitted with a large rear cargo door to allow vehicles to be driven straight into the hold. On 11 December 1953, the Soviet Council of Ministers issued directive No.2922-1251 to the Antonov OKB, requiring them to build a twin-turboprop transport aircraft derived from the DT-5/8. Bearing the in-house designation Izdeliye P the resulting aircraft followed state-of-the-art practice with a high wing carrying two propeller engines, atop a rectangular-section fuselage, tricycle undercarriage with main gear units housed in pods {{on either side of the}} fuselage, and an upswept rear fuselage providing clearance of the tail unit for loading and unloading. After State acceptance trials, production was not recommended due to poor spin characteristics, directional stability and control issues, nosewheel shimmy, poor controllability when landing in crosswinds above 6m/s (12 kt) and also phugoid oscillations in all three axes which were difficult to control and made piloting the prototype tiring. As well as the aerodynamic faults, the TV-2 engines proved difficult to start with unstable gas dynamics at altitudes above 6,000 m (19,700ft).|$|R

It was the first thrash metal album to enter the German album charts where it reached number 36. Agent Orange sold 100,000 copies in Germany alone and marked the commercial break through for the band. The song [...] "Ausgebombt" [...] was released on the EP Ausgebombt with German lyrics.|$|E
50|$|From {{the start}} of Eastern Front combat in World War II, the Soviet Air Force (VVS) used the {{successful}} ground attack aircraft Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik, powered by the Mikulin AM-38 inline engine. As the war progressed, the Soviets laid plans for that aircraft's successor. The main goal was to increase speed and maneuverability at low altitudes, mainly to evade small-caliber anti-aircraft artillery, which was the main threat for ground attack aircraft, and to {{remove some of the}} Il-2's faults. The most promising project was a modern, light and maneuverable close <b>assault</b> <b>aircraft,</b> the Sukhoi Su-6, developed by Pavel Sukhoi's bureau from 1942. At the same time, Sergei Ilyushin developed a heavier aircraft, the BSh M-71, (Il-8 M-71), derived from the Il-2 design, on which it was partly based, to be powered by the prototype Tumansky M-71 radial engine, which did not enter production.|$|E
5000|$|In the Battle of Kursk (Operation Citadel), General Vasily Ryazanov {{became a}} master {{in the use}} of attack {{aircraft}} en masse, developing and improving the tactics of Il-2 operations in co-ordination with infantry, artillery and armored troops. Il-2s at Kursk used the [...] "circle of death" [...] tactic: up to eight Sturmoviks formed a defensive circle, each plane protecting the one ahead with its forward machine guns, while individual Il-2s took turns leaving the circle, attacking a target, and rejoining the circle. Ryazanov was later awarded the Gold Star of Hero of Soviet Union twice, and the 1st <b>Assault</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Corps under his command became the first unit to be awarded the honorific title of Guards. In 1943, one loss corresponded to 26 Sturmovik sorties. About half of those lost were shot down by fighters, the rest falling to anti-aircraft fire.|$|E

5000|$|The true {{capabilities}} of the Il-2 are difficult to determine from existing documentary evidence. W.

In another report of the action on the same day, a Soviet staff publication states that: Ground forces highly valued the work of aviation on the battlefield. In {{a number of instances}} enemy attacks were thwarted thanks to our air operations. Thus on 7 July enemy tank attacks were disrupted in the Kashara region (13th Army). Here our <b>assault</b> <b>aircraft</b> delivered three powerful attacks in groups of 20-30, which resulted in the destruction and disabling of 34 tanks. The enemy was forced to halt further attacks and to withdraw the remnants of his force north of Kashara. Glantz and Orenstein 1999, p. 260.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. As the United States enters a new millennium, the armed forces, {{and in particular}} the Marine Corps, face new challenges in the manner that they deploy and operate. Reductions in both personnel and naval shipping, coupled with an ever-changing world political environment, have led to a dramatic shift {{in the way that the}} United States must project its power. As recent combat operations in Afghanistan have demonstrated, there is a valid requirement for forces to possess the ability to operate from the sea directly to an objective area with minimal or no amphibious landing support. This thesis provides an analysis of the most advantageous <b>assault</b> support <b>aircraft</b> allocation aboard a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) in operations such as this. With the MEU tasked as one of the prominent fixtures in the timely projection of power ashore for the United States, the capabilities (or lack thereof) of <b>assault</b> support <b>aircraft</b> become increasingly important as ship-to-objective distances increase. Our method of finding an optimal composition of aircraft consists of constructing an Assault Support Optimization Model (ASOM). ASOM is assists us in prescribing an ideal configuration of <b>assault</b> support <b>aircraft</b> while emulating the dynamic amphibious environment. ASOM analyzes the assignment of several aircraft combinations (4 CH- 53 E/ 12 MV- 22, 6 CH- 53 E/ 10 MV- 22, 8 CH- 53 E/ 8 MV- 22 and 10 CH- 53 E/ 6 MV- 22) establishing which delivers the greatest ship to objective support to the MEU's Ground Combat Element. The results on various runs of ASOM (at distances of 50 nm, 75 nm, 100 nm and 125 nm) identify that the optimal aircraft composition varies with ship-toobjective distances. Overall differences are not dramatic and we do not have further evidence that any aircraft combination clearly outperforms the others. According to the heuristic results obtained in this thesis, we would cautiously recommend a mix of 6 CH- 53 E and 10 MV- 22 aircraft which, on average, seems to produce better results, and is always the best or second choice regardless of the ship-to-objective distance.
