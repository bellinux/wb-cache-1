5|$|As Mikawa's force {{neared the}} Guadalcanal area, the Japanese ships {{launched}} three floatplanes for one final reconnaissance of the Allied ships, {{and to provide}} illumination by dropping flares during the upcoming battle. Although several of the Allied ships heard and/or observed {{one or more of}} these floatplanes, starting at 23:45 on August 8, none of them interpreted the presence of unknown aircraft in the area as an <b>actionable</b> threat, and no one reported the sightings to Crutchley or Turner.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the criticisms leveled against {{scientific}} jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and distorts the effect of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out <b>actionable</b> evidence of juror bias, particularly {{in the context of}} a limited voir dire.|$|E
5|$|The NLRB {{applied a}} right it had {{recently}} announced in Quality Mfg. Co. and then clarified in Mobil Oil Corp. that employees in unionized workplaces {{had a right}} under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) {{to the presence of}} a union representative during any inquiry where the employee's job might be in jeopardy. The NLRB had explained in those decisions that having a union representative present was an exercise of the right to the 'mutual aid and protection' protected by Section 7. Therefore, an employer's refusal of such presence was an unfair labor practice and <b>actionable</b> under the NLRA. As a result, the NLRB found that Weingarten had engaged in an unfair labor practice by refusing Collins a representative and Weingarten appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.|$|E
5|$|The goal of elucidating {{pathophysiology}} {{has also}} led to increased interest in the association between risk-SNPs and the gene expression of nearby genes, the so-called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies. The reason is that GWAS studies identify risk-SNPs, but not risk-genes, and specification of genes is one step closer towards <b>actionable</b> drug targets. As a result, major GWA studies by 2011 typically included extensive eQTL analysis. One of the strongest eQTL effects observed for a GWA-identified risk SNP is the SORT1 locus. Functional follow up studies of this locus using small interfering RNA and gene knock-out mice have {{shed light on the}} metabolism of low-density lipoproteins, which have important clinical implications for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|McCarthyism {{has taken}} on a broader meaning, {{describing}} the excesses of similar efforts. The term is also now used more generally to describe reckless, unsubstantiated accusations, as well as demagogic attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries. During the McCarthy era, hundreds of Americans were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or private-industry panels, committees and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, educators and labor union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person's real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was sometimes exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of employment or destruction of their careers; some even suffered imprisonment. Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts later overturned, laws that were later declared unconstitutional, dismissals for reasons later declared illegal or <b>actionable,</b> or extra-legal procedures that would come into general disrepute.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, the Lithuanian {{government}} {{discussed the}} new developments. It decided that Merkys {{should return to}} Kaunas and Urbšys should deliver a note offering withdrawal from the Baltic Entente, a full investigation of the incident, and dismissal of Skučas and Povilaitis. A personal letter from President Antanas Smetona to Chairman of Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Mikhail Kalinin repeated assurances that Lithuania always honored the mutual assistance pact. The third and final meeting between Merkys, Urbšys, and Molotov on June 11 brought no resolution. The Soviets continued to press charges which the Lithuanians could not meaningfully answer and made no more <b>actionable</b> requests. On June 12, Merkys returned to Lithuania and informed {{the government of the}} situation. It was decided that Skučas should resign and Povilaitis would be immediately dismissed. The Lithuanian Army was ordered to be alert, but no orders were issued regarding mobilization or preparedness. Lithuanian politicians did not fully understand the gravity of the situation and did not think the results would be catastrophic. Urbšys reported that the Soviets strongly disapproved of Merkys and his cabinet; he suggested that a new government be installed, possibly led by Stasys Raštikis, former Commander-in-Chief of the Lithuanian Army. Such suggestion interfered with Lithuania's domestic affairs.|$|E
25|$|Trespass to land is {{any direct}} {{interference}} with {{land in the}} possession of another and is <b>actionable</b> per se. Examples of trespass are unauthorised entry to land, placing things on land and inducing animals to enter. Also, continuing trespass, which is <b>actionable</b> from day to day, occurs when there is continuation of presence after permission is withdrawn. The position taken with regards to the elements of trespass is similar in the UK and India.|$|E
25|$|However, in India, {{the weight}} of the {{authorities}} is for discarding between libel and slander and making both of them <b>actionable</b> per se. In UK, only libel and certain types of slander is <b>actionable</b> per se. Criminal libel in UK was abolished in 2010, while both slander and libel remain criminal offences in India, making people liable not just to the extent of damages but also undergoing imprisonment. An injunction may also be granted to stop further publication of defamatory material.|$|E
25|$|Statements {{of future}} {{intention}} are not generally <b>actionable</b> representations, so {{that someone who}} fails {{to carry out a}} stated intention is not making a misrepresentation. However, a misrepresentation of one's present intention is <b>actionable.</b> As Bowen LJ said in Edgington v Fitzmaurice, 'the state of a man's mind is just as much a fact as the state of his digestion.' So where Mr Edgington had bought shares after he heard the company was seeking capital to expand, but in reality it was to pay off debts, he was entitled to rescind his purchase.|$|E
25|$|The {{motto of}} CLAWS is “Victory through Vision”. It encapsulates the {{founding}} idea of employing academic and practical research to provide <b>actionable</b> {{knowledge to the}} strategic community of India and the world.|$|E

25|$|In business, {{originality}} is not enough. The idea {{must also}} be appropriate—useful and <b>actionable.</b> Creative competitive intelligence is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to innovation process and competitive intelligence to creative workers.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, {{remaining}} on Earth, {{as a living}} being surrounded by a working ecosystem, is a fair statement {{of the most basic}} values and goodness to any being we are able to communicate with. A moral system without this axiom seems simply not <b>actionable.</b>|$|E

25|$|Article 13 {{provides}} for the right for an effective remedy before national authorities for violations of rights under the Convention. The inability to obtain a remedy before a national court for an infringement of a Convention right is thus a free-standing and separately <b>actionable</b> infringement of the Convention.|$|E
25|$|A DOI name also {{differs from}} {{standard}} identifier registries {{such as the}} ISBN, ISRC, etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas {{the primary purpose of}} the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers <b>actionable</b> and interoperable, where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.|$|E
25|$|On 27 September 2002, Brazil {{requested}} {{consultations with}} the US regarding prohibited and <b>actionable</b> subsidies provided to US producers, users and/or exporters of upland cotton, {{as well as}} legislation, regulations, statutory instruments and amendments thereto providing such subsidies (including export credits), grants, and any other assistance to the US producers, users and exporters of upland cotton.|$|E
25|$|Fear {{and desire}} for <b>actionable</b> {{intelligence}} led {{the administration to}} legal opinions (the Torture Memos, including the Bybee memo) by the Office of Legal Counsel, United States Department of Justice, issued to the CIA in August 2002 authorizing the use of 12 enhanced interrogation techniques (since 2009, these have been legally defined as torture and prohibited from use) with detained suspects.|$|E
25|$|While private {{nuisance}} is always <b>actionable,</b> public nuisance is not. A claimant of public nuisance has to establish special loss {{over and above}} the inconvenience suffered by the public in general, as public nuisance is a crime and it would be unreasonable for everyone inconvenienced by it to be allowed to claim. This distinction was followed in India, along with the UK principles of nuisance.|$|E
25|$|State courts {{responded by}} {{filling in the}} gap, {{grounding}} an opinion privilege in their own constitutions. New York's ruled {{that as long as}} an opinion relied on accurately stated and reported facts, it was not <b>actionable</b> as long as the content, tone and apparent purpose of the statement distinguished it as opinion. This privilege does not apply, however, to any accusations of criminal or illegal activity.|$|E
25|$|Formal {{accusation}} was {{the second}} element of the trial of Socrates, which the accuser, Meletus, swore to be true, before the archon (a state officer with mostly religious duties) who considered the evidence and determined {{that there was an}} <b>actionable</b> case of “moral corruption of Athenian youth” and “impiety”, for which the philosopher must legally answer; the archon summoned Socrates for a trial by jury.|$|E
25|$|BPM is now {{considered}} {{a critical component of}} operational intelligence (OI) solutions to deliver real-time, <b>actionable</b> information. This real-time information can be acted upon {{in a variety of ways}} – alerts can be sent or executive decisions can be made using real-time dashboards. OI solutions use real-time information to take automated action based on pre-defined rules so that security measures and or exception management processes can be initiated.|$|E
25|$|In May 2015, {{the company}} {{acquired}} Savant Protection, enabling IT organizations to deploy a unique agent for whitelisting the applications {{that can be}} used on any particular endpoint. When Blue Coat Systems launched the Alliance Ecosystem of Endpoint Detection and Response in July 2015, Digital Guardian was among the alliance-founding members.

Also in July, IT consulting firm Atos and Digital Guardian partnered up to deliver Atos’ cloud-based data loss prevention service.|$|E
25|$|The law of arms as {{understood}} in Scotland {{consists of two}} principal parts, the rules of heraldry (such as blazoning), and the law of heraldry. In contrast to the position in England, the Law of Arms is {{a branch of the}} civil law. A coat of arms is incorporeal heritable property, governed, subject to certain specialities, by the general law applicable to such property. The possession of armorial bearings is therefore unquestionably a question of property. The misappropriation of arms is a real injury, <b>actionable</b> under the common law of Scotland.|$|E
25|$|Before {{he heard}} from Cadwalader, Washington {{had only three}} pieces of intelligence, {{all of which were}} ascertained through {{prisoner}} interrogation: firstly, that General James Grant had reinforced British troops at Princeton; secondly, that the aggregate force there comprised over 8,000 soldiers; and thirdly, that they intended to advance on Trenton. It is likely that Cadwalader's report, obtained from a plainclothes spy who ingratiated himself with British officers, relieved Washington both by suggesting a substantially weaker enemy force of around 5,000 men and by providing detailed, <b>actionable</b> information on their positions and disposition.|$|E
25|$|The National Security Division {{monitors}} {{the conduct of}} field enforcement operations in the investigation, detection, interdiction, prosecution, and removal of foreign-born terrorists, terrorist supporters, and hostile foreign intelligence agents located within the United States. This branch also has operational oversight of all HSI special agents assigned to the 103 Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF), provides continuous support to all counter-terrorism investigations and HSI field offices supporting those counter-terrorism efforts and provides <b>actionable</b> proactive counter-terrorism lead information, in furtherance of preventing and disrupting alien terrorist cells domestically and abroad.|$|E
25|$|It {{will not}} always be {{possible}} to sue under s 2(1), however. If there is no contract, for instance if an agreement was void ab initio on the ground of non est factum, {{then it will be}} necessary to sue under Hedley Byrne. Also, the misrepresentation must precede the contract, and is not <b>actionable</b> under s 2(1) even if it is found in the contract subsequently. Lastly, it has been suggested by McKendrick that if s 2(1)'s application leads to draconian consequences, a court may not be willing to enforce it.|$|E
25|$|Another approach, which avoids typing or cutting-and-pasting into a {{resolver}} is {{to include}} the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as http://doi.org/ (preferred) or http://dx.doi.org/, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI 10.1000/182 can {{be included in a}} reference or hyperlink as https://doi.org/10.1000/182. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal hyperlink. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be <b>actionable.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to some {{lines of}} thinking, the ageing process is routed into a basic {{reduction}} of biological complexity, and thus loss of information. In order {{to reverse this}} loss, gerontologist Marios Kyriazis suggested {{that it is necessary}} to increase input of <b>actionable</b> and meaningful information both individually (into individual brains), and collectively (into societal systems). This technique enhances overall biological function through up-regulation of immune, hormonal, antioxidant and other parameters, resulting in improved age-repair mechanisms. Working in parallel with natural evolutionary mechanisms that can facilitate survival through increased fitness, Kyriazis claims that the technique may lead to a reduction of the rate of death as a function of age, i.e. indefinite lifespan.|$|E
25|$|That {{same week}} the Senate Ethics Committee began an {{investigation}} into the matter, but dropped it the following month concluding that the dealings did not violate the Senate's standards of conduct or conflict-of-interest rules. Later that same month the Chronicle reported on another dealing by the Senator. Since 1999, Perata's campaign fund and various other political committees had paid Exit Strategies more than $743,000, according to campaign finance documents. Exit Strategies, a political direct mail firm, was launched in 1999 by Perata's son, Nick, and based at his father's Alameda County home. By their own accounting, Exit Strategies paid the senator nearly $138,000 during the same period for rent and consulting fees. The Senate Ethics Committee again ruled that this was not an <b>actionable</b> violation, but it raised questions into the propriety of the relationship.|$|E
25|$|Between 24 December 2014 to 25 March 2015, {{based on}} the National Action Plan, {{government}} arrested 32,347 people on different charges in 28,826 operations conducted across the country. During the same period Pakistan deported 18,855 Afghan refugees while the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) registered 64 cases for money transfer through Hawala, arrested 83 people and recovered Rs. 101.7million. In total, 351 <b>actionable</b> calls were received on the anti-terror helpline and National Database and Registration Authority verified total 59.47million SIMs. On 28 March 2016, a suicide attack by the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar at a park in Lahore killed 70 people {{on the evening of}} Easter Sunday. Analysts believed that Sharif's desire to maintain stability in Punjab led him to turn a blind eye towards groups operating in Punjab. Following the attack Pakistan rounded up more than 5,000 suspects and arresting 216 people.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} hone {{the manner in}} which things, media and big data are interconnected, it is first {{necessary}} to provide some context into the mechanism used for media process. It has been suggested by Nick Couldry and Joseph Turow that s in media approach big data as many <b>actionable</b> points of information about millions of individuals. The industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using specific media environments such as newspapers, magazines, or television shows and instead tap into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations. The ultimate aim is, of course, to serve or convey, a message or content that is (statistically speaking) in line with the consumer's mindset. For example, publishing environments are increasingly tailoring the messages (articles) to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various data-mining activities.|$|E
25|$|According to the JCT, an {{organization}} that provides workers with sufficient levels of skill variety (using different skills and talents in performing work), task identity (contributing to a clearly identifiable larger project), and task significance (impacting the lives or work of other people) {{is likely to have}} workers who feel their work has meaning and value. Sufficiently high levels of autonomy (independence, freedom and discretion in carrying out the job) will inspire the worker to feel responsibility for the work; and sufficiently high levels of Task Feedback (receiving timely, clear, specific, detailed, <b>actionable</b> information about the effectiveness of his or her job performance) will inspire the worker to feel the organization is authentically interested in helping to foster his/her professional development and growth. The combined effect of these psychological states results in desired personal and work outcomes: intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, performance quality, low absenteeism, and low turnover rate.|$|E
25|$|The 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) {{added to}} its combat history during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In August 1990 {{the group was}} called upon to conduct {{operations}} in Southwest Asia {{in response to the}} Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. During this crisis the Army's First Special Operations Task Force consisting of elements of the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), comprising 106 special operations teams, performed a wide variety of missions. These spanned a wide scope of operations, including support to coalition warfare; conducting foreign internal defense missions with the Saudi Arabian Army; performing special reconnaissance, border surveillance, direct action, combat search and rescue missions; and advising and assisting a pan-Arab equivalent force larger than six U.S. divisions; as well as conducting civil-military operations training and liaison with the Kuwaitis. The border surveillance mission assigned the 5th Special Forces was key to providing <b>actionable</b> intelligence to the US and Pan-Arab Forces. New military relationships were forged between the US and the Arab dictatorships.|$|E
