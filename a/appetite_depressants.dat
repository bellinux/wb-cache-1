A second group received six sessions of a realistic attention-control condition, while a third group served as nontreated controls. At {{the end of}} treatment, covert sensitization 5 s reporting the greatest reaction to the imagined scene showed greater weight loss than the attention-control and control groups. At a 6 -wk. follow-up, the treatment effect including all covert sensitization 5 s was highly significant. Self-report measures indicated that covert sensitization 5 s perceived their treatment positively and were highly motivated. Anxiety reduction and weight loss {{were found to be}} uncorrelated. These results offer considerable support for the efficacy of covert sensitization in the treatment of obesity. The literature concerning attempts to modify maladaptive overeating suggests that this behavior is quite resistent to change. A rather wide variety of treatments has been employed including dietary instruction and nutrition clinics (Young, More, Berresford, Einset, & Waldner, 1955; Yule, Martin, & Young, 1957), the use of <b>appetite</b> <b>depressants</b> (Silverstone & Solomon, 1965), various types of group therapies (Holt & Winick, 1961; McCann &Trulson, 1955), hypnosis (Erickson, 1960), a combination of self-control procedures (Stuart, 1967), aversion therapy (Meyer & Crisp, 1964), aversion-relief therapy (Thorpe...|$|E

Histological features showed a hamartoma of the eccrine sweat glands.

(1941) in dogs indicated that ingestion of amphetamine caused a depression of food con-sumption. Similar findings in humans were ob-served {{by a number of}} clinical investigators (Davidoff and Reifenstein, 1937; Nathanson, 1937; Ulrich, 1937) and soon thereafter other in-vestigators indicated that amphetamine could advantageously be used as an <b>appetite</b> <b>depressant</b> in the clinical management of obesity (Lesses an...|$|R
