Azelastine, cyproheptadine, mequitazine and promethazine were the most active among the tested drugs. Diphenhydramine and cetirizine possessed weaker activity whereas doxylamine, fexofenadine and loratadine were inactive even at the highest tested concentration (1 mg/ml).

40|$|Attention {{was drawn}} {{previously}} {{to the fact}} that several synthetic drugs pos-sessing antihistamine properties w-ere also capable of diminishing or blocking some excitatory effects of epinephrine (Loew 1947; 1950). The most striking example was the discovery that a-naphthylmethylethyl-fl-bromoethylamine HBr (SY- 28) is a potent adrenergic blocking drug of the 2 -haloalkylamine type and, in addition, this drug exerts a strong antihistamine action. Thus a single com-pound pharmacologically antagonizes effects of epinephrine and histamine, substances which are in themselves physiological antagonists in many respects. Nevertheless, the majority of <b>antihistaminics</b> are fairly specific with respect to histamine blockade, although many of them are known to increase the pressor responses to epinephrine in anesthetized dogs (Loew, 1950).

The experiments were carried out in the belief that the analysis of time-concentration relation would contribute to the clarification of the mode of actions of these drugs and that the determination of the influence of the pretreatment with, or combined use of, adrenaline, atropine, magnesium and the <b>antihistaminics,</b> which were assumed to antagonize the actions of acetylcholine, histamine and barium, on the contraction of the isolated ileum and uterus would be helpful in measuring the antagonizing activities of these drugs. The results are summarized as follows: (1) When the inverse logarithms of time (x) was plotted against the logarithm of molar concentration (Y), the following relation held: Y=a×bX, where a and b were the constants specific to drugs. (2) Acetylcholine and adrenaline manifested the shortest latent period. While the latent period of histamine was a little longer, BaCl_ 2 and MgCl_ 2 showed the longest latent priods of all. (3) In the form of curve expressing time-concentration relation, the curves obtained with acetylcholine and adrenaline showed the sharpest slope. The slopes of curves obtained with vagostigmine, atropine and DAI were similar to those obtained with acetylcholine and adrenaline. The slope of curve obtained with histamine was less sharp, and the slopes of curves obtained with <b>antihistaminics</b> and quinine approximated to it. The slopes of curves obtained with BaCl_ 2 and MgCl_ 2 was the least sharp. (4) When the isolated ileum and uterus of the guinea pig were pre-treated with adrenaline, atropine or MgCl_ 2, the latent periods of the actions of acetylcholine, histamine or BaCl_ 2 were lengthened. Atropine, adrenaline and atropine were most effective on acetylcholine, atropine and barium, respectively, in lengthening the time needed to Produce effect. (5) Studies on the actions of the mixtures of acetylcholine, histamine or BaCl_ 2 with adrenaline, atropine and MgCl_ 2 on the isolated uterus of the mouse showed that the latent periods of the actions of acetylcholine, histamine and BaCl_ 2 were lengthened. Atropine was most effective in lengthening the latent period of acetylcholine, while adrenaline was most effective on both histamine and BaCl_ 2.
