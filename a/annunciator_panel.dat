50|$|An <b>annunciator</b> <b>panel,</b> {{also known}} in some {{aircraft}} as the Centralized Warning Panel (CWP), {{is a group}} of lights used as a central indicator of status of equipment or systems in an aircraft, industrial process, building or other installation. Usually, the <b>annunciator</b> <b>panel</b> includes a main warning lamp or audible signal to draw the attention of operating personnel to the <b>annunciator</b> <b>panel</b> for abnormal events or conditions.|$|E

50|$|In large buildings, {{a central}} fire alarm <b>annunciator</b> <b>panel</b> is located {{where it is}} {{accessible}} to fire-fighting crews. The <b>annunciator</b> <b>panel</b> will indicate the zone and approximate physical location {{of the source of}} a fire alarm in the building. The annunciator will also include lamps and audible warning devices to indicate failures of alarm circuits. In a large building such as an office tower or hotel, the fire annunciator may also be associated with a control panel for building ventilation systems, and may also include emergency communication systems for the building.|$|E
50|$|In the {{aircraft}} industry, <b>annunciator</b> <b>panels</b> are groupings of annunciator lights that indicate status of {{the aircraft}}'s subsystems. The lights are usually accompanied with a test switch, which when pressed illuminates all the lights to confirm they are in working order. More advanced modern aircraft replaces these with the integrated electronic Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System or Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor.|$|R
50|$|<b>Annunciator</b> <b>panels</b> were {{relatively}} costly to install in a plant {{because they had}} dedicated wiring to the alarm initiating devices in the process plant. Since incandescent lamps were used, a lamp test button was always provided to allow early detection of failed lamps. Modern electronic distributed control systems usually require less wiring since the process signals can be monitored within the control system, and the engraved windows are replaced by alphanumeric displays on a computer monitor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} specifies {{principles and}} processes {{for the management}} of alarm systems based on distribute control systems and computer-based Human-Machine Interface (HMI) technology for the process industries. It covers alarms from all systems presented to the operator, which can include basic process control systems, <b>annunciator</b> <b>panels,</b> safety instrumented systems, fire and gas systems, and emergency response systems.The practices are applicable to continuous, batch, and discrete processes. The process industry sector includes many types of manufacturing processes, such as refineries, petrochemical, chemical, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, and power.|$|R
50|$|An {{aviation}} <b>annunciator</b> <b>panel</b> {{will have}} a test switch to check for burned out lamps. Indicator lights are grouped together by their associated systems into various panels of lights.|$|E

50|$|All {{models of}} the Dash 7 Series are powered by a 12-cylinder or 16-cylinder, turbocharged, GE 7FDL 4-stroke diesel engine carried over from the Universal Series, and have speed-based {{adhesion}} control with a multi-channel LED <b>annunciator</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, {{software}} carries its own reliability risks. Reliance on {{a software}} program to trigger an alarm assumes that the analog signal, the programmer's logic code and HMI, the PLC or PC running the programs, and the interaction between all of the above, are all entirely trustworthy. This is exacerbated by frequently changing computer hardware & firmware platforms {{and the need to}} modify existing software. Alternatively new <b>annunciator</b> <b>panels</b> are utilizing long lasting and bright LEDs that significantly reduce the cost and maintenance of the panels. These new versions of the traditional system are still preferred over computer based systems especially in critical plants like nuclear power generation, oil and gas.|$|R
40|$|Gemstone Team Future Firefighting AdvancementsFire sensor systems {{effectively}} {{monitor the}} state of the building, detect fire, and alert occupants {{in the event of an}} emergency. However, fire sensor technology is limited in its ability to convey information to firefighters. Even though all of the necessary information can be obtained through Fire <b>Annunciator</b> Control <b>Panels</b> (FACPs), it is difficult to use them to track the progression of fire. We designed and prototyped a decision aid system to illustrate our approach to this problem. Our goal was to create a tactical decision aid display that can present building information through an intuitive interface in real time. We used previous research on the information needs of firefighters in designing the interface. Our key insight was to use a floor plan with a sensor information overlay to organize information. We implemented a prototype that interfaces with FACPs using existing facilities systems management communication protocols...|$|R
50|$|The crew-alerting system (CAS) is used {{in place}} of the <b>annunciator</b> <b>panel</b> on older systems. Rather than {{signaling}} a system failure by turning on a light behind a translucent button, failures are shown as a list of messages in a small window near the other EICAS indications.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>annunciator</b> <b>panel</b> may display {{warnings}} or {{cautions that}} are not necessarily indicative of a problem; for example, a Cessna 172 on its after-landing roll will often flicker the [...] "Volts" [...] warning simply due to the idle throttle position and therefore the lower voltage output of the alternator to the aircraft's electrical system.|$|E
50|$|In {{industrial}} process control, an <b>annunciator</b> <b>panel</b> {{is a system}} to alert operators of alarm conditions in the plant. Multiple back-lit windows are provided, each engraved {{with the name of}} a process alarm. Lamps in each window are controlled by hard-wired switches in the plant, arranged to operate when a process condition enters an abnormal state (such as high temperature, low pressure, loss of cooling water flow, or many others). Single point or multipoint alarm logic modules operate the window lights based on a preselected ISA 18.1 or custom sequence.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the cabin {{incorporates}} a spacious and comfortable interior, intentionally reminiscent of luxury road vehicles. It can be accessed via {{either side of the}} aircraft; the door is intended to be left ajar while on the ground so that the cabin is better ventilated. A large canopy provides the pilots with a generous external view; elements of the cockpit instrumentation and controls, such as the <b>annunciator</b> <b>panel,</b> central pedestal, and individual elements like the nav/com and the circuit breakers, have been positioned to enable their easy overview as well. To aid in achieving fuel-efficiency, a simple fuel tank selection arrangement, augmented by digital gauges, is present upon most models.|$|E
40|$|Scientific Instruments, Inc. has now {{developed}} a second generation, commercially available instrument to detect flames in hazardous environments, typically refineries, chemical plants and offshore drilling platforms. The Model 74000 detector incorporates a sensing circuit that detects UV radiation in a 100 degree conical {{field of view}} extending as far as 250 feet from the instrument. It operates in a bandwidth that makes it virtually 'blind' to solar radiation while affording extremely high sensitivity to ultraviolet flame detection. A 'windowing' technique accurately discriminates between background UV radiation and ultraviolet emitted from an actual flame, hence the user is assured of no false alarms. Model 7410 CP is a combination controller and <b>annunciator</b> <b>panel</b> designed to monitor and control as many as 24 flame detectors. *Model 74000 is no longer being manufactured...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} the self-confidence of autonomous systems is proposed to assist operators in understanding the state of unmanned vehicles under control. A sensing-optimization/verification-action (SOVA) model, similar to the perception-cognition-action human informational processing model, has been developed to illustrate how autonomous systems interact with their environment and how areas of uncertainty affect system performance. LIDAR and GPS were examined for scenarios where sensed surroundings could be inaccurate, while discrete and probabilistic algorithms were surveyed for situations {{that could result in}} path planning uncertainty. Likert scales were developed to represent sensor and algorithm uncertainties, and these scales laid the foundation for the proposed Trust <b>Annunciator</b> <b>Panel</b> (TAP) consisting of a series of uncertainty level indicators (ULIs). The TAP emphasizes the critical role of human judgment and oversight, especially when autonomous systems operate in clustered or dynamic environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in continuous loads such as radio transmitters and microprocessors in substations {{has led some}} utilities, including ours, {{to take a closer}} look at the sizing of the stationary batteries that operate those stations when commercial power is lost. Critical functions, such as tripping circuit breakers and conununicating information to dispatch centers, are placed on DC power. When station power is present, that DC power for the continuous loads is supplied by the charger. When conunercial power is lost, however, the continuous loads are carried by the batteries, which must also have the capacity to operate tripping mechanisms. IEEE Standard 485 I is widely accepted as the guideline for sizing of stationary batteries, and its application is discussed. Once a battery is placed in service, its maintenance, monitoring and periodic testing protocols are the next issues that the utility considers. Those practiced by this utility are discussed, including monitoring of the presence of DC power at certain critical points by SCADA equipment. The COIIlIOOnvoltages in electric utility substations are 48 and 120. 48 volt systems are more common, and are the preferred choice when allowable because of their smaller physical size and ease of maintenance. In some stations, however, the physical size of the station requires the higher voltage in order to lower the current and thus the voltage drop. Changes in equipment over the last twenty years have caused an {{increase in}} the continuous loads placed on substation batteries. In the 1970 s, the continuous loads were generally these 2 : indicator lights on circuit breakers indicator lights on <b>annunciator</b> <b>panel</b> 0. 3 amps 0. 1 amp 0. 4 amp total The desire for remote control and monitoring of events in the substation, however, has caused additional equipment to be added to the load on the DC system. Today, a typical station will have these continuous loads: indicator lights on circuit breakers indicator lights on <b>annunciator</b> <b>panel</b> Feeder overcurrent relays Feeder monitor relays backup overcurrent relays Differential relay RT...|$|E
40|$|This {{test report}} {{documents}} {{the results obtained}} while conducting operational testing of the sampling equipment in the 225 -WC building, the PFP Wastewater Sampling Facility. The Wastewater Sampling Facility houses equipment to sample and monitor the PFP`s liquid effluents before discharging the stream to the 200 Area Treated Effluent Disposal Facility (TEDF). The majority of the streams are not radioactive and discharges from the PFP Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC). The streams that might be contaminated are processed through the Low Level Waste Treatment Facility (LLWTF) before discharging to TEDF. The sampling equipment consists of two flow-proportional composite samplers, an ultrasonic flowmeter, pH and conductivity monitors, chart recorder, and associated relays and current isolators to interconnect the equipment to allow proper operation. Data signals from the monitors are received in the 234 - 5 Z Shift Office which contains a chart recorder and alarm <b>annunciator</b> <b>panel.</b> The data signals are also duplicated {{and sent to the}} TEDF control room through the Local Control Unit (LCU). Performing the OTP has verified the operability of the PFP wastewater sampling system. This Operability Test Report documents the acceptance of the sampling system for use...|$|E
