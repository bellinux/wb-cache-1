5|$|On Ralph's death a second-cousin of dramatist William Congreve {{inherited}} the manor. The Congreve Family owned the estate {{at the time}} of the 1830 Swing Riots. The rioters marched across Aldermaston, wrecking twenty-three <b>agricultural</b> <b>machines.</b> Workers were so frightened by the riots that they left their machinery in the open in an attempt to limit additional damage. Around the same time, the River Kennet (along the north side of the estate) was made navigable between Reading and Newbury.|$|E
5|$|Other {{factors of}} concern for the painted turtles include over-collection from the wild, {{released}} pets introducing diseases or reducing genetic variability, pollution, boating traffic, angler's hooks (the turtles are noteworthy bait-thieves), wanton shooting, and crushing by <b>agricultural</b> <b>machines</b> or golf course lawnmowers or all-terrain vehicles. Gervais and colleagues note that research itself impacts the populations and that much funded turtle trapping work has not been published. They advocate discriminating more on what studies are done, thereby putting fewer turtles into scientists' traps. Global warming represents an uncharacterized future threat.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{sought to}} abolish the Machine-Tractor Stations (MTS) which not only owned most large <b>agricultural</b> <b>machines</b> such as {{combines}} and tractors, but also provided services such as plowing, and transfer their equipment and functions to the kolkhozes and sovkhozes (state farms). After a successful test involving MTS which served one large kolkhoz each, Khrushchev ordered a gradual transition—but then ordered that the change take place with great speed. Within three months, {{over half of the}} MTS facilities had been closed, and kolkhozes were being required to buy the equipment, with no discount given for older or dilapidated machines. MTS employees, unwilling to bind themselves to kolkhozes and lose their state employee benefits and the right to change their jobs, fled to the cities, creating a shortage of skilled operators. The costs of the machinery, plus the costs of building storage sheds and fuel tanks for the equipment, impoverished many kolkhozes. Inadequate provisions were made for repair stations. Without the MTS, the market for Soviet agricultural equipment fell apart, as the kolkhozes now had neither the money nor skilled buyers to purchase new equipment.|$|E

Germany's assistance with {{the restoration of the}} university library of Louvain, which was destroyed by the Germans on 25 August 1914, was also credited towards the sum, as were some of the territorial changes the treaty imposed upon Germany. The payment schedule required [...] within twenty-five days and then [...] annually, plus 26 per cent of the value of German exports. The German Government was to issue bonds at five per cent interest and set up a sinking fund of one per cent to support the payment of reparations.|$|E

60|$|Unless my ignorance {{has been}} abused, nothing {{remarkable}} has happened at Doncaster in two thousand years, {{but this is}} itself a distinction in that eventful England where so many things have happened elsewhere. It is the market town of a rich farming region, and has notable manufactures of iron and brass, of sacking and linen, of spun flax and of <b>agricultural</b> <b>machines</b> and implements. Otherwise, it is important only for its races, which began there three hundred years ago, and especially for its St. Leger Day, of which Lieutenant-General St. Leger became the patron saint in 1778, though he really established his Day two years earlier.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a freshly}} furrowed field, {{so large that}} the eye at first {{scarcely}} took in its magnitude. The irregular surface of upturned, oily, wave-shaped clods took {{the appearance of a}} vast, black, chopping sea, that reached from the actual shore of San Francisco Bay to the low hills of the Coast Range. The sea-breeze that blew chilly over this bleak expanse added to that fancy, and the line of straggling whitewashed farm buildings, that half way across lifted themselves above it, seemed to be placed on an island in its midst. Even the one or two huge, misshapen <b>agricultural</b> <b>machines,</b> abandoned in the furrows, bore an odd resemblance to hulks or barges adrift upon its waste.|$|E

It was market-day, and the market was stopped by the invaders, and the <b>agricultural</b> <b>machines</b> brought for sale and exhibition were broken up. The picture that remains in his mind {{is of a great}} excited crowd in which men and cattle and sheep were mixed together in the wide street, which was the market-place, and of shouting and noise of smashing machinery, and finally of the mob pouring forth over the down {{on its way to the}} next village, he and other little boys following their march.|$|E
50|$|A {{transplanter}} is an <b>agricultural</b> <b>machine</b> {{used for}} transplanting seedlings to the field.
