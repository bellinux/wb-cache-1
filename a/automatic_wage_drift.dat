Empirical results demonstrate that union efforts to level wage differentials exerted large positive effects on both centrally negotiated wage changes and <b>wage</b> <b>drift.</b> We also show that <b>wage</b> <b>drift</b> was accurately predicted and fully incorporated into central wage agreements. Central bargaining therefore dominated the wage inflation process.

40|$|This paper aims at {{answering}} the question: How does a typically European bargaining system - with collective bargaining, extension mechanisms and national minimum wage - coexist with low unemployment rate and high wage flexibility? A unique data set on workers, firms and collective bargaining contracts in the Portuguese economy {{is used to}} analyze the determinants of both the bargained wage and the <b>wage</b> <b>drift.</b> Results indicate that <b>wage</b> <b>drift</b> stretches the returns to every worker and firm attribute, whereas it shrinks the returns to union bargaining power. Therefore, firm-specific arrangements, in the form of <b>wage</b> <b>drift,</b> partly offset collective bargaining, granting firms a high degree of freedom when setting wages. Union bargaining power raises the overall wage level, but lowers the returns on worker attributes, an outcome of the egalitarian policy pursued. ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the boom}} years of the 1960 s and 1970 s <b>wage</b> <b>drift</b> (the {{difference}} between growth rates of wages and salaries actually paid and wage increases as negotiated by unions in collective bargaining) was strongly positive in Austria's manufacturing industry. This trend was reversed during the recession of 1974 - 75; since then, only briefly interrupted by a peak in the early 1980 s, <b>wage</b> <b>drift</b> has been negative for the manufacturing sector as a whole. This phenomenon can be observed for most branches of manufacturing as well. These changes have, however, not levelled wage differentials.

We estimate this <b>wage</b> <b>drift</b> effect in the case of university professors. We use a logit analysis with 1999 census data to identify the determinants of career advancement, to estimate the employment distribution in previous years and to obtain the corresponding wage bill.

40|$|The way {{the labour}} market {{functions}} {{is a crucial}} factor in any analysis of the Swedish model. Full employment contributed {{to the growth of}} what were probably the two most important institutions in this model: centralised negotiations between the social partners and, secondly, the Rehn-Meidner model, involving pay policies based on solidarity with the low-paid. Here, we have examined the role of the employers in the rise, application and fall of the centralised bargaining model. In this respect, the Swedish Metal Trades Employers' Association (VF), the largest and most important employer organisation in the peak association SAF, was the actor whose interests eventually led to the model's demise. The principal cause was discontent over the way this bargaining model worked in practice. The engineering industries felt their interests were being neglected in the giant employer collective. This empirical investigation into an employer organisations's internal actions, combining economic history with organisation theory, shows the importance of the market mechanism for employer policy during full employment. They sought {{a solution to the problem}} of <b>wage</b> <b>drift.</b> Significantly, it began by helping to push through centralised bargaining in the 1950 s. When <b>wage</b> <b>drift</b> subsequently showed a tendency to decline towards the end of the 1970 s, this was seen as a result of more extensive local and regional organisation. Competition and <b>wage</b> <b>drift,</b> it was felt, could be handled better through local collaboration than through large-scale collective action.

We find no stable negative relation between wages and unemployment across regions in the Nordic labor markets once regional fixed effects are accounted for. Wage formation at the regional level is characterized by considerable persistence, but unemployment exerts no immediate influence on wages at the regional level. There is no evidence of a wage curve, nor of a Phillips curve, at the regional level in the Nordic countries.

40|$|We {{develop and}} {{estimate}} {{a model of}} the child support and labor supply decisions in the formal and underground sectors for low-income fathers who have never married the mother of their child, as well as the paternity establishment decisions of the mothers. Ethnographic studies have found that child support policies such as <b>automatic</b> <b>wage</b> withholding, relatively high child support award amounts, and low child support disregards for children on welfare may encourage low-income fathers to evade child support regulations by working ‘off the books’ and by making under-the-table child support payments. Similarly, these policies, particularly the low child support disregard for women on welfare, may encourage mothers of children born outside marriage to refuse to cooperate with the child support authorities in establishing paternity and obtaining a formal child support order. Our model assumes a Stackelberg structure in which the father can implicitly determine whether the mother cooperates with the child support authorities through an informal child support payment, which may be zero. If the father’s informal child support payment is not high enough to induce the mother to not cooperate with establishing paternity, then he is subject to <b>automatic</b> <b>wage</b> withholding of the ordered amount if he works in the formal sector.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} Sweden's {{structural}} problems of slow productivity growth and high wage inflation {{can be linked}} in an important way to the institutional features of its labor market, which {{is characterized by a}} combination of centralized bargaining and wage equalization. In particular, Sweden's high wage inflation in the 1980 s was due to the combined impact of the breakdown of the leading role assigned to the traded goods sector in wage determination and high <b>wage</b> <b>drift.</b> Slow productivity growth is attributed to the inappropriateness of the policy of wage equalization in an environment in which flexible work practices have become increasingly important. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{system of}} wage {{setting in the}} Nordic {{countries}} is often regarded as highly centralised, contributing to considerable real wage flexibility. This view has been questioned, as sizeable <b>wage</b> <b>drift</b> may offset the effect of central negotiations. This paper presents evidence from the four major Nordic countries, suggesting {{that there is little}} or no such offsetting effect. Yet, at central negotiations, the institutional system of wage formation may induce nominal rigidities that may prevent wage restraint when there is little room for money wage growth. Empirical evidence supports the existence of nominal rigidity. Copyright 1998 by The editors of the Scandinavian Journal of Economics. ...|$|R
30|$|<b>Automatic</b> {{indexation}} of <b>wages</b> to {{prices is}} {{a proxy for}} centralisation. This method has survived only in Belgium and Luxembourg.

Against the specific recommendation under the EU’s new economic governance system, the Belgian government decided in 2012 to retain <b>automatic</b> <b>wage</b> indexation with some adjustments in the calculation. The latest central agreement for 2013 – 14 allows wages to rise {{only as much as}} the change in the cost-of-living index.

40|$|The {{methodology}} {{used in the}} dissertation is a {{paired comparison}} of Ireland (?Social Partnership? 1987 - 2005) and Australia (?The Accord? 1983 - 1996), with reference to other cases of central wage bargaining in liberal economies. The primary research question is, what explains the stability of Irish central wage bargaining {{in comparison to the}} decentralization of wage bargaining experienced in Australia in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s? There are two conditions that must be sustained in order that central wage bargaining is stable in open liberal economies. First, public sector wages must be kept under strict control and large <b>wage</b> <b>drift</b> must be avoided. Second, export sector employers must be able to exercise pay flexibility. Pay flexibility is defined as encompassing an outcome dimension (exporters should be allowed to give pay increases above or below the centrally agreed wage bargain increase) and a process dimension (exporters should be allowed to set wages with a minimum of interference from third parties, be they wage setting institutions or trade unions). The two necessary conditions of public sector wage control and export sector pay flexibility are found in the Irish case explaining central wage bargaining stability, but not in the Australian case, explaining its wage bargaining decentralization. In Ireland after 1987, the stability of the system has been enabled by a concerted effort by policy-makers to de-couple pay movements between the public and export sectors. This is achieved through allowing export employers pay flexibility, while ending old patterns of public sector relativities-driven wage bargaining. This is in contrast to the late 1970 s and early 1980 s where large public sector <b>wage</b> <b>drift</b> caused the decentralization of wage bargaining. The Australian system decentralized because wage arbitration institutions created during a closed trade policy regime interfered with the process aspect of pay flexibility of exporters. These institutions intruded into wage setting at the plant level, and enhanced the power of trade unions to influence and alter the wage setting process. This provoked a successful export-employer led offensive on the central wage bargaining system...|$|R
50|$|Since Japan {{has been}} in {{recession}} and deflation, with union membership falling, {{the value of the}} shuntō and the <b>automatic</b> <b>wage</b> increases associated with it have come under threat. The major unions in steel, electronics and the automotive industry have been forced to restrict their demands and even accept zero offers from the employers. The concern has become to protect existing pay structures and jobs. With greater pressure on the workforce the rise in karōshi and karō jisatsu are worrying trends. During recent years, there has been criticism among the younger generation that shuntō has become a performance. A shrinking labor union is a serious problem in industries like manufacturing, where the number of non-regular employees, who are ineligible to participate in labor unions, has increased in contrast to diminishing regular employees.|$|R
30|$|In general, {{centralization}} may {{not necessarily}} mean coordination or vice versa (OECD 1997). First, {{if there is a}} significant discrepancy between the individual firm-level negotiated wage and the globally negotiated wage, which is called <b>wage</b> <b>drift,</b> the extent of coordination may be weaker despite the centralized wage setting. Second, institutions such as pattern-setting may promote coordination, while it is also substitutable for institutions that are intended to promote centralization. 6 There are several different claims regarding the effects of centralization and coordination on unemployment rates. Nickell (1997) refers to the notion of OECD (1994) Table 5.16 that coordinative arrangements lower wages, while centralized arrangements do not, and summarizes that the negative effects of unionization on employment are mitigated by coordination. In contrast, Calmfors and Driffill (1988) claim that the relation between centralization and employment is U-shaped, while Driffill (2006) later find that highly coordinated or centralized bargaining leads to wage restraint and a low unemployment rate.|$|R
