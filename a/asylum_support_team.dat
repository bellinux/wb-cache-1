40|$|Reforms of {{the system}} around the {{accommodation}} and <b>support</b> needs of <b>asylum</b> seekers entering the United Kingdom (UK), during the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have meant that the <b>support</b> of <b>asylum</b> seekers has largely moved away from mainstream social work to be based within dedicated <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> <b>teams.</b> This article investigates how the workers engaged as <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> workers understand {{and make sense of}} their participation in the <b>support</b> of <b>asylum</b> seekers dispersed across the UK. By drawing upon qualitative research with <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> workers this paper looks at how such workers make sense of their roles and how the ‘support’ of asylum seekers is conceived. The paper concludes that by working within this political and controversial area of work, workers are constantly finding ways to negotiate their support role within a dominant framework of control...|$|R

40|$|This chapter focuses {{upon some}} of the {{narratives}} of housing and ‘support’ service provision set {{against the backdrop of}} the <b>support</b> of <b>asylum</b> seekers in the United Kingdom. Since 1999 specific <b>asylum</b> seeker <b>support</b> <b>teams</b> have been established within a number of local authorities throughout the UK contracted to the Home Office to provide housing and social <b>support</b> to destitute <b>asylum</b> seekers. Currently, the regions of the UK, operate within a national legislative arena led by the Home Office whilst simultaneously negotiating the local expectations of local ‘communities’. From this position these professionals are required to fulfil a range of often seemingly conflictual and contradictory roles including among others, housing provider, social carer, informal immigration control and community liaison. In recent research Sales and Hek (2004) have raised the issue of the tension that they perceive exists in the work of these professionals with asylum seekers between the ‘care’ of asylum seekers and the ‘control’ required by national legislation and policy. However, rather than professionals performing a ‘balancing’ between these seemingly ‘conflictual’ roles, as suggested by Sales and Hek (2004), what this chapter suggests is something that resonates with the Bakhtinian notion of ‘polyphony’ (Bakhtin, 1984). From this perspective the roles and duties of an <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> professional are not approached from a position where a professional has to weigh up between the performance of either one role or another, where an individual worker can only fulfil these caring and controlling roles at separate times. Rather, it is recognised that roles and duties can be deployed equally and simultaneously where professionals can be both caring and at the same time controlling. What this chapter would like to suggest is that such simultaneous performance of a number of roles appears to enable the emergence of a seemingly unproblematic ‘multi-voiced’ worker that successfully negotiates between care, control, community, integration, and segregation and a variety of other positions and discourse...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impact of <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> systems on refugee {{integration}} focusing on the UK and the Netherlands. Both have adopted deterrent approaches to <b>asylum</b> <b>support.</b> The Dutch favour the use of asylum accommodation centres, segregating asylum seekers from the general population. The UK disperses asylum seekers to housing within deprived areas, embedding them within communities. Both countries {{have been criticized for}} these practices which are viewed as potentially anti-integrative: something of a paradox given that both promote the importance of refugee integration. We analyse national refugee integration surveys in both countries and provide original empirical evidence of negative associations between <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> systems and refugees’ health which differ in relation to mental and physical health. The integration and asylum policy implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Since 2009, {{there has}} been a duty on the Home Secretary to promote the welfare of {{children}} in the UK immigration system. However, no formal review of the <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> system had been carried out until 2012 when a Parliamentary Inquiry was set up to look at <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> provided by the Home Office and whether it meets the needs of children, young people and families. Based on parliamentary hearings and the submitted evidence received, in 2013 the panel published its findings. What shocked the panel was the lack of regard for children’s education, relationships, health or home life. Alongside 24 recommendations of reform, the panel stated that the <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> system was in need of urgent change if it was to meet its statutory duty to promote the welfare of children, ensure that children’s best interests come first and to avoid putting children’s lives at risk. Taking a localised approach to the themes in the Parliamentary Inquiry, this paper is based on research carried out in 2015 with mothers of children who live or have lived in receipt of <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> in Kirklees. Mothers were interviewed about <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> provided by the Home Office in relation to the needs of children and young people and also the ways in which children and young people’s lives could be improved within the asylum system.

40|$|This report {{represents}} {{the findings of}} an eighteen month research project that examines the challenges faced by <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> groups in the United States and the United Kingdom, and different ways of responding to those challenges. The research has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council of the UK 1. The research {{has been carried out}} by four people: Drs Nick Gill, Deirdre Conlon, Ceri Oeppen and Imogen Tyler. The purpose of this report is to provide information to the <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> sector by disseminating our findings about the common challenges faced by those working with this vulnerable population in two different national settings, and the strategies being engaged by <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> organisations to confront these common challenges. Our research project uncovered a range of organisations that offer practical assistance to asylum seekers in a variety of ways: for example by visiting asylum seekers in detention, helping to prepare their legal cases, providing creative, artistic, spiritual, health-related, political and practical support, advocating on their behalf with authorities and policy makers and by raising the profile of asylum-seekers in news media and other public forums. We began by mapping the kinds of organisations that exist in two national settings—the US and UK—and then used a questionnaire to capture as much information as possible about them. The questionnaire was undertaken by over 130 organisations. We then conducted 35 in-depth interviews with individuals working in <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> organisations, as well as 3 focus groups. Over the course of collecting the data, the size, scale and diversity of the <b>asylum</b> <b>support</b> sector became apparent. Though there were many differences there was a uniting theme in the data we collected: an enduring sense of injustice at the treatment of asylum seekers and widespread recognition of the needto do more to change the social, legal and political situations which lead to inequalities and discrimination. Further, all of the organisations we interviewed expressed their desire to persist with difficult support work in the face of deepening economic crises and hardening border-policy contexts, and to find ways of galvanising others to assist this often isolated and marginalised migrant population. We hope this report makes a contribution to the critical work of the asylum-advocacy sector by sharing ideas and best practice between what are sometimes large national organisations with paid and unpaid workers, but are more often small local and isolated groups of volunteers. We hope this research project will facilitate further collaboration between asylum advocacy groups, and between this sector and academic researchers...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{deals with}} the support and help offered to elderly people over 65 with mental disabilities out of {{personnel}} from a special <b>support</b> <b>team.</b> We have chosen to use the qualitative method to answer our questions. We have four semi-structured interviews with all staff from the <b>support</b> <b>team</b> {{we have been in}} contact with, three nurses/nursing assistants and project manager for the <b>support</b> <b>team.</b> We have recognized five themes and divided the text into six different categories and disciplines that answers and highlights the importance of meeting clients' needs, increase their independence and quality of life. Our theme is security, continuity, time, treatment and relations. Our topics are quality of life and health, personalized and holistic, empowerment, motivation and participation, activity and disengagement and stigma. The conclusion of our essay {{is that there is a}} need for a special team to meet the needs of older people with mental disabilities. The <b>support</b> <b>team</b> has more time and can give clients the support they need. The time gives staff the opportunity to increase clients' quality of life by listening and understanding. The staff provides security with their presence and attitude while becoming a social contact for the client. The staff has the knowledge required to provide good treatment. The staff of the <b>support</b> <b>team</b> works with high professionalism and flexibility. The <b>support</b> <b>team</b> is working from the client's needs when the operation should be given and how it should be. The <b>support</b> <b>team</b> works with the continuity that provides a better and deeper relationship with the client. We have found that staff in the <b>support</b> <b>team</b> is working to get their clients to feel that they are able to do things themselves and build up their confidence and self esteem. This is the <b>support</b> <b>team</b> doing by lifting up what clients can and try to motivate clients to do things. By the <b>support</b> <b>teams</b> encouragement and <b>support</b> clients can find faith in themselves to handle things and become independent. <b>Support</b> <b>team</b> works with their clients so that they feel the meaningfulness of everyday life. By the motivation from the <b>support</b> <b>team</b> clients has managed to become more involved in their daily work. The <b>support</b> <b>team</b> provides personalized care to their clients. We have found it impossible to generalize and think that all older people with mental disabilities can be satisfied by for example activity and interaction with other people. For many of these clients their need may change. Passivity and aloofness can be an experience of tranquility and well-being and to decrease stress. Another aspect we have found, the reason why clients withdraw and isolate themselves at home is that clients put “stamp” on themselves as mentally ill. This negative self-image can be influenced by impressions from the surroundings. By that clients are treated with respect and sensitivity of personnel, client's view of themselves can change. The <b>support</b> <b>team</b> works to ensure opportunities in their clients' daily lives and not obstacles...|$|R
