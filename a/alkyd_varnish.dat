40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} <b>alkyd</b> <b>varnish</b> on thermal {{stability}} and static smoke properties of decorative wood were analysed by using thermo-gravimetric (TG) analyzer, {{differential scanning calorimeter}} and plastic smoke density tester. The TG results show that maximum mass loss of the wood and <b>alkyd</b> <b>varnish</b> occurs {{in the range of}} 200 - 500 °C. At the pyrolysis stage, the <b>alkyd</b> <b>varnish</b> exhibits an obvious endothermic process, while the wood exhibits an obvious endothermic process and then an exothermic one. The infrared analysis and smoke density test show that the olefin structure and benzene ring structure of <b>alkyd</b> <b>varnish</b> increase both the special optical density and mass optical density of the decorative wood consisted <b>alkyd</b> <b>varnish.</b> Meanwhile, the higher external heat flux and application of an ignition source decrease the special optical density and mass optical density of the decorative materials...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} the electrochemical {{evaluation of a}} proposed copper corrosion protection hybrid coating acting as a smart corrosion protection system. This consists of an <b>alkyd</b> <b>varnish,</b> painted over electrospun nylon fibers acting as a secondary diffusion barrier and also as a benzotriazole (BTAH) inhibitor nanocontainer. Submicron diameter electrospun nylon 6 - 6 fiber nanocontainers were prepared from a polymeric solution containing BTAH at different concentrations, and Cu samples were coated with the electrospun fibers and painted over with an <b>alkyd</b> <b>varnish</b> by the drop method. Functional groups in fibers were determined through FTIR spectroscopy. Optical and SEM microscopies were used to characterize the nanocontainer fibers. Samples were evaluated using electrochemical impedance and noise, during six weeks of immersion, in a chloride-ammonium sulfate solution. Excellent response was obtained for the smart inhibitor coating system. For long periods of immersion good corrosion protection performance was observed. The results presented demonstrate the good barrier properties of the hybrid coating, obstructing the diffusion of aggressive species, through the electrospun structure. Furthermore the nanocontainer functionality to store and liberate the corrosion inhibitor, only when it is needed, was also proved...|$|E
50|$|Pentaerythritol is a {{versatile}} building block for {{the preparation of}} many polyfunctionalized compounds, such as the explosive and vasodilator pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and the polymer cross-linking agent pentaerythritol tetraacrylate. Derivatives of pentaerythritol are components of <b>alkyd</b> resins, <b>varnishes,</b> polyvinyl chloride stabilizers, tall oil esters, and olefin antioxidants. Can be found in transformer oil, plastics, cosmetics, and many other applications.|$|R
5000|$|An alkyd is a {{polyester}} {{modified by}} the addition of fatty acids and other components. They are derived from polyols and a dicarboxylic acid or carboxylic acid anhydride. The term alkyd is a modification of the original name [...] "alcid", reflecting {{the fact that they are}} derived from alcohol and organic acids. The inclusion of the fatty acid confers a tendency to form flexible coating. Alkyds are used in paints and in moulds for casting. They are the dominant resin or [...] "binder" [...] in most commercial [...] "oil-based" [...] coatings. Approximately 200,000 tons of alkyd resins are produced each year. The original alkyds were compounds of glycerol and phthalic acid sold under the name Glyptal. These were sold as substitutes for the darker colored Copal resins, thus creating <b>alkyd</b> <b>varnishes</b> which were much paler in colour. From these, the alkyds we know today were developed.|$|R
50|$|Pyrolysis gas {{chromatography}} {{is useful for}} the identification of involatile compounds and synthetic polymeric media, such as acrylics or <b>alkyds,</b> and synthetic <b>varnishes.</b> The {{way in which the}} polymer fragments before it is separated in the GC can help in identifying the way that the sample polymer assembled itself (step growth v. chain growth, for example). The method of pyrolysis {{gas chromatography}} can also be used for environmental samples, including fossils.Trace evidence scientists in forensic laboratories use Pyroylsis GC to compare and identify paint or finish found at crime scenes or victims.|$|R
30|$|There is no surface {{protective}} {{material on the}} wall paintings of Tubo Period (sixth century C.E.). However, after the fifth Dalai Lama, materials were used to protect {{the surface of the}} wall paintings. The materials can increase the gloss of the surface and can prevent the loss of pigment caused by repeated touching from thousands of believers. The traditional Tibetan {{protective material}}s (such as egg white, oils, etc.) are occasionally mentioned in local treatises. However, the recipes have not been written in detail and have been lost. Since 13 th Dalai Lama Period, Tibetan painters have begun to use natural protective varnishes with imported resins, which were replaced by <b>alkyd</b> resin <b>varnishes</b> during the 1970 s according to accounts of local painters. Tung oil and rosin resin were detected in samples of the varnish, both of which can be dissolved in turpentine, but {{it is not possible to}} date the application of the varnish due to the use of the same materials by painters today.|$|R
40|$|In {{answer to}} the {{increased}} demand for Co-free driers for alkyd based paints, a biomimetic approach {{has been used to}} find suitable and environmentally friendly alternatives for Co-based driers for alkyd paints. This approach was chosen due to the resemblance between the mechanisms by which alkyd paints dry and lipids are oxidized in biological systems. As a consequence, the combination of iron with reducing agents was tested as drier for alkyd paints. Ascorbic acid and several ascorbic acid derivatives, in combination with iron salts, have been tested in alkyd emulsions, <b>alkyd</b> resins (or <b>varnishes),</b> and in a high gloss white paint formulation. We have found that the combination of iron salts with reducing agents forms an excellent drier, in terms of film hardness and particularly total drying time, compared to a commercial Co drier and a new Mn-based alternative. The effect of two nitrogen donor ligands, N,N-bis(2 -ethyl- 5 -methyl-imidazol- 4 -ylmethyl) aminopropane (BIAP) and 2 -ethyl- 4 -methylimidazole (Im), to the mixture reducing agent/iron was also studied in a high gloss white paint formulation. Outstanding total drying time of just 2. 2 h was observed for the combination of ascorbic acid 6 -palmitate, iron and imidazol...|$|R
40|$|Remarkable {{increases}} {{in the performance of}} complex systems can be achieved by a collective approach to optimizing individual factors that influence performance. This approach, termed the aggregation of marginal gains, is tested here as a means of improving the performance of exterior clear-coatings. We focused on five factors that influence clear-coating performance: dimensional stability of wood; photostability of the wood surface; moisture ingress via end-grain; coating flexibility and photostability; and finally coating thickness. We performed preliminary research to select effective wood pre-treatments and durable clear-coatings, and then tested coating systems with good solutions to each of the aforementioned issues (factors). Red oak and radiata pine panels were modified with PF-resin, end-sealed, and thick acrylic, <b>alkyd</b> or spar <b>varnishes</b> were applied to the panels. Panels were exposed to the weather and the level of coating defects was assessed every year over a 4 -year period. All of the coatings are performing well on PF-modified pine after 4 years’ outdoor exposure. In contrast, coatings failed after 2 years on unmodified pine and they are failing on PF-modified oak. We conclude that our approach shows promise. Future research will build on the current work by developing solutions to additional factors that influence clear-coating performance...|$|R
