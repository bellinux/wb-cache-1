The newer monument also marks the burial place of Poe's wife, Virginia, and his mother-in-law, Maria. Theories as to what caused Poe's death include suicide, murder, cholera, hypoglycemia, rabies, syphilis, influenza, and that Poe was a victim of cooping.

40|$|Worldwide, <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> train {{residents}} to become competent providers of patient care. To assess adequate training, <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> are increasingly evaluated on their teaching performance. Research suggests that personality traits affect teaching performance, consistent with studied effects of personality traits on job performance and academic performance in medicine. However, up till date, research in clinical teaching practice {{did not use}} quantitative methods and did not account for specialty differences. We empirically studied the relationship of attending physicians' personality traits with their teaching performance across surgical and non-surgical specialties. We conducted a survey across surgical and non-surgical specialties in eighteen medical centers in the Netherlands. Residents evaluated attending physicians' overall teaching performance, {{as well as the}} specific domains learning climate, professional attitude, communication, evaluation, and feedback, using the validated 21 -item System for Evaluation of Teaching Qualities (SETQ). <b>Attending</b> <b>physicians</b> self-evaluated their personality traits on a 5 -point scale using the validated 10 -item Big Five Inventory (BFI), yielding the Five Factor model: extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism, agreeableness and openness. Overall, 622 (77 %) <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> and 549 (68 %) residents participated. Extraversion positively related to overall teaching performance (regression coefficient, B: 0. 05, 95 % CI: 0. 01 to 0. 10, P = 0. 02). Openness was negatively associated with scores on feedback for surgical specialties only (B: - 0. 10, 95 % CI: - 0. 15 to - 0. 05, P < 0. 001) and conscientiousness was positively related to evaluation of residents for non-surgical specialties only (B: 0. 13, 95 % CI: 0. 03 to 0. 22, p = 0. 01). Extraverted <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> were consistently evaluated as better supervisors. Surgical <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> who display high levels of openness were evaluated as less adequate feedback-givers.

5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate {{back and forth from the}} doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her <b>attending</b> <b>physician,</b> which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series.

40|$|International audienceAIMS: Indications {{for surgery}} in acute infective {{endocarditis}} (IE) are detailed in guidelines, but their application {{is not well}} known. We analysed the agreement between the patient's <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> and European Society of Cardiology guidelines regarding indications for surgery. We also assessed whether surgery was performed in patients who had an indication. METHODS AND RESULTS: From the 2008 prospective population-based French survey on IE, 303 patients with definite left-sided native IE were identified. For each case, we prospectively recorded (i) indication for surgery according to the <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> and (ii) indication for surgery according to guidelines. Surgery was indicated in 194 (65 %) patients according to <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> and in 221 (73 %) according to guidelines, while 139 (46 %) underwent surgery. Agreement was moderate between <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> and guidelines (kappa 0. 41 - 0. 59) and between indication according to guidelines {{and the performance of}} surgery (kappa 0. 38). Of the 90 (30 %) patients not operated despite indication, contraindication to surgery was reported by the <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> in 42 (47 %), and indication was not identified in 48 (53 %). One-year survival was 76 % in patients with indication and surgery performed (n = 131), 69 % in patients without indication and no surgery (n = 74), 56 % in patients with identified indication and contraindication to surgery (n = 42), and 60 % in patients with no identified indication (n = 48; P = 0. 059).

Code status orders are one way to inform end-of-life medical decision making. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the extent to which pediatric providers have knowledge of code status options and explore the association of provider role with (1) knowledge of code status options, (2) perception of timing of code status discussions, (3) perception of family receptivity to code status discussions, and (4) comfort carrying out code status discussions. Nurses, trainees (residents and fellows), and <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> from pediatric units where code status discussions typically occur completed a short survey questionnaire regarding their knowledge of code status options and perceptions surrounding code status discussions. Single center, quaternary care children's hospital. 203 nurses, 31 trainees, and 29 <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> in 4 high-acuity pediatric units responded to the survey (N = 263, 90 % response rate). Based on an objective knowledge measure, providers demonstrate poor understanding of available code status options, with only 22 % of providers able to enumerate more than two of four available code status options. In contrast, provider groups self-report high levels of familiarity with available code status options, with <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> reporting significantly higher levels than nurses and trainees (p = 0. 0125). Nurses and <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> show significantly different perception of code status discussion timing, with majority of nurses (63. 4 %) perceiving discussions as occurring "too late" or "much too late" and majority of <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> (55. 6 %) perceiving the timing as "about right" (p< 0. 0001). <b>Attending</b> <b>physicians</b> report significantly higher comfort having code status discussions with families than do nurses or trainees (p≤ 0. 0001). <b>Attending</b> <b>physicians</b> and trainees perceive families as more receptive to code status discussions than nurses (p< 0. 0001 and p = 0. 0018, respectively). Providers have poor understanding of code status options and differ significantly in their comfort having code status discussions and their perceptions of these discussions. These findings may reflect inherent differences among providers, but may also reflect discordant visions of appropriate care and function as a potential source of moral distress. Lack of knowledge of code status options and differences in provider perceptions are likely barriers to quality communication surrounding end-of-life options...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In medical education, {{particularly}} in residency courses, {{most of the}} training occurs in real clinical environments. Workplace-based learning profoundly affects students’ knowledge, attitudes, and practice; therefore, it should be properly planned. Due to the extensiveness of the clinical environment and its importance in training residents, investigating how residents learn in these environments and detecting factors that influence effectiveness will help curriculum designers to promote residents’ learning by improving their learning environment. Therefore, our qualitative content analysis study, aimed to examine the experiences and perspectives of internal and surgical residents and their <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> about learning in clinical settings. Methods: This qualitative content analysis study was conducted through purposeful sampling. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 15 internal and surgical residents and 15 of their <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> at educational hospitals of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Results: The main categories explored in this study were hidden curriculum, learning resources, and learning conditions. In the context of clinical environment and under its individual culture, residents learn professionalism and learn to improve their communication skills with patients and colleagues. Because of clinical obligations such as priority of treating the patients for education or workload of the <b>attending</b> <b>physicians,</b> residents acquire most of their practical knowledge from colleagues, fellows, or follow-up patients in different learning conditions (such as: educational rounds, morning reports and outpatient clinics). They see some of their <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> as role models. Conclusion: Changing cultural and contextual factors is of prime importance to promote a learning-oriented environment in a clinical setting. The present findings will help curriculum planners and <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> to improve residents’ learning by means of appropriate workplace planning and by considering the components involved in clinical learning...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Although {{surgical}} checklist use {{is not new}} in Switzerland, {{compliance and}} actual use fall short behind expectations taking scientific recommendation as standard.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess current checklist use in Switzerland following a national media campaign. We further analyse possible group differences between <b>attending</b> <b>physicians,</b> hospital staff, and participants of a quality improvement initiative. Methods A cross-sectional online-survey study was conducted by Swiss Patient Safety Foundation in Switzerland in 2015. The survey sample consisted of members of three Swiss professional associations of invasive health care (N[*]=[*] 1194). The survey assessed use of, knowledge of and attitudes towards the surgical checklist. A MANOVA to test for an overall effect and one-way ANOVAs for each dependent variable were conducted. Results For four out of six variables describing the ease of checklist use, hospital staff and participants of quality improvement initiative were significantly more positive about checklist use than <b>attending</b> <b>physicians.</b> A similar patter emerged for intentions, norms, attitude, acceptance, and perceived behavioural control. On all dimensions, hospital staff and quality improvement participants scored significantly higher than <b>attending</b> <b>physicians.</b> Significant differences especially between <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> and hospital staff and <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> and participants of the initiative emerged for different variables covering use of, knowledge of and attitudes towards the surgical checklist.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} reliability of transvaginal assessment of fetal head station by using a newly designed birth simulator. Study design: This prospective study involved 32 residents and 25 <b>attending</b> <b>physicians.</b> Each operator was given all 11 possible fetal stations in random order. A fetal head mannequin was placed in 1 of the 11 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) stations (- 5 to + 5) in a birth simulator equipped with real-time miniaturized sensor. The operator then determined head position clinically using the ACOG classification. Head position was described as: (1) "engaged" or "nonengaged" (engagement code); (2) "high," "mid," "low," or "outlet" (group code); and (3) according to the 11 ACOG ischial spine stations (numerical code). Errors were defined as differences between the stations given by the sensor and by the operator. We determined the error rates for the 3 codes. Results: "Numerical" errors Occurred in 50 % to 88 % of cases for residents and in 36 % to 80 % of cases for <b>attending</b> <b>physicians,</b> depending on the position. The mean "group" error was 30 % (95 % CI 25 %- 35 %) for residents and 34 % (95 % CI 27 %- 41 %) for <b>attending</b> <b>physicians.</b> In most cases (87. 5 % for residents and 66. 8 % for <b>attending</b> <b>physicians)</b> of misdiagnosis of *'high" station, the "mid" station was retained. Residents and <b>attending</b> <b>physicians</b> made ail average of 12 % of "engagement" errors, equally distributed between false diagnosis of engagement and nonengagement. Conclusion: Our results show that transvaginal assessment of fetal head station is poorly reliable, meaning clinical training should be promoted. The choice not to perform vaginal delivery when the fetus is in the "mid'* position strongly decreases the risk of applying instruments on an undiagnosed "high" station. Conversely, obstetricians who perform only "low" operative vaginal deliveries also deliver unrecognized "mid" station fetuses. Therefore, residency programs should offer training in "mid" pelvic operative vaginal deliveries. Birth simulators {{could be used in}} training programs...|$|R
