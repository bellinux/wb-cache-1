40|$|Jankovic et al (2010, this issue) {{discuss the}} role of advance {{statements}} in England and Wales as introduced in the Mental Capacity Act 2005. My article comments on their views from the different legal position in Scotland. This requires some description {{of the position of}} advance statements as introduced in the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003. Scotland is unusual, and possibly progressive, in having advance statements for mental health embedded in its mental health legislation and not as part of a more generic capacity legislation or introduced as an independent piece of legislation (Atkinson 2006). The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act also requires a person to have significantly impaired ability to make medical decisions before they become subject to the Act. The review of the mental health act in Scotland has to be seen in the context of pre-existing capacity legislation, the <b>Adults</b> <b>with</b> <b>Incapacity</b> (Scotland) Act 2000, which does not deal with advance directives or advance decisions (Patrick 2006; Atkinson 2007). These remain a matter for common law in Scotland...|$|R
40|$|It {{may be of}} {{interest}} to compare the article by Curtice and colleagues (2012, this issue) with the situation in Scotland. Powers of attorney for financial and welfare matters are the subject of Part 2 of the <b>Adults</b> <b>with</b> <b>Incapacity</b> (Scotland) Act 2000 (the 2000 Act). This Act replaced a patchwork of archaic and confusing legislation and provided a framework for decisions where adults lack or lose capacity (Ward 2003). Incapacity in Scotland The definition of incapacity in Scotland is somewhat different from that in England and Wales. Section 1 (6) of the 2000 Act defines incapacity as meaning incapable of acting, making decisions, understanding decisions, communicating decisions or retaining the memory of decisions by reason of mental disorder or inability to communicate because of physical disorder. ‘Incapable of acting’ is a crucial difference and does not appear in the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (the 2005 Act). There are situations where an adult must be able to act on a decision to secure his/her own welfare or finances. For example, granting or revoking a power of attorney requires positive action from the adult. Clinicians should be wary when relatives or friends appear to be coercing the adult into action. This is one issue in an ongoing investigation by th...|$|R
40|$|This PhD thesis has two core objectives: 1) To {{critically}} analyse {{and compare}} the legal provisions relating to capacity assessment in England and Wales, Scotland and India 2) To critically analyse {{and compare the}} legal provisions relating to decision-making {{on behalf of the}} incapable patient in England and Wales, Scotland and India. The methodology utilised to achieve these objectives is essentially a classic literature based comparative approach. This thesis provides an original contribution to knowledge by virtue of the fact that an in-depth tripartite comparative study of capacity law provisions in England and Wales, Scotland and India has Yet to be undertaken within existing literature. The research undertaken in this thesis is timely given the implementation of capacity legislation in England and Wales and the relevant provisions of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 of England and Wales and the <b>Adults</b> <b>with</b> <b>Incapacity</b> (Scotland) Act 2000 are compared and critiqued as part of a discussion of the key ethical, legal and procedural concepts which underpin the law of capacity. In addition, the capacity law of England and Scotland is compared with the equivalent system in Indian law, which is at a nascent stage of development in comparison to the United Kingdom. The fact that India, despite being an Eastern country, also retains the influence of U. K law through its status as a Commonwealth country, means that the differences between the English, Scottish and Indian approaches to capacity can be attributed to issues of culture or development. The research undertaken for this thesis has shown that developmental issues are of greater impact, and while cultural issues are of some relevance, there are enough underlying commonalities between the three jurisdictions to suggest that India's capacity law is at a different point developmentally speaking.

40|$|There is {{widespread}} evidence {{both of the}} exclusion of older people from clinical research, and of under-recruitment to clinical trials. This review and opinion piece provides practical advice to assist researchers both to adopt realistic, achievable recruitment rates and {{to increase the number}} of older people taking part in research. It analyses 14 consecutive recently published trials, providing the number needed to be screened to recruit one older participant (around 3 : 1), numbers excluded (up to 49 %), drop out rates (5 – 37 %) and whether the planned power was achieved. The value of planning and logistics are outlined, and approaches to optimising recruitment in hospital, primary care and care home settings are discussed, together with the challenges of involving older <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> mental <b>incapacity</b> and those from minority groups in research. The increasingly important task of engaging older members of the public and older patients in research is also discussed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: to {{identify}} the association between the older adult's functional capacity and the caregiver's burden. METHOD: a cross-sectional, quantitative study, undertaken in a municipality {{in the north of}} the Brazilian state of Paran&# 225;, <b>with</b> 178 older <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> functional <b>incapacity,</b> and their caregivers. The Functional Independence Measure was used for evaluating the older adults' functional capacity, and the Zarit Burden Interview was used for evaluating the caregiver burden, with the results being analyzed quantitatively. The majority of the older adults were females, widowed, {{with a mean age of}} 79. 9 years old, and needing assistance for up to 50 % of the daily living tasks. The majority of the caregivers were females, daughters, married, and had a mean age of 56. 7 years old. RESULT: the majority of the caregivers reported moderate burden; the men presented higher probabilities of lower burden than the women; and the more independent the older adult was, the higher the probabilities of the caregiver having low burden. CONCLUSION: encouraging actions directed at the promotion of active and healthy ageing centered on the maintenance of functional capacity and the older adult's autonomy, and implanting strategies for the organizing of care in the home which include the caregiver's health, can contribute to minimizing the effects of burden and improve quality of life...|$|R

The International Classification of Functioning, disabilities and health (ICF) was used to classify dimensions of functional outcome.

The current state of knowledge on the functional outcome after burns was hard to summarise, due to the wide variety in study designs and outcome assessment methods. Some indications on the major functional problems after burns were gained. Problems in mental function were described in subgroups of patients, both in children/adolescents and adults. Restrictions in range of motion were observed in about one-fifth of burn patients, even 5 years after injury.
