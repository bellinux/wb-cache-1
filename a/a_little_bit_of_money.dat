5000|$|The guy who {{cooked up}} the idea, Dale Yocum, {{was trying to}} explain to the {{management}} {{that there are a lot}} people out there that like to write programs and if we can publish these programs for them, it's a win-win. He put together a business plan for it and said 'Look, we only need <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and this thing can be self sufficient and it might make some money.' They grudgingly agreed to let him do it because the Atari platform desperately needed a larger software base, a void not being filled by the other publishers of the day. And so he did it and very quickly made it into a monster success. It was a major profit center for Atari. They rewarded Dale for his initiative by bringing in another guy to be Dale's boss... so Dale, in disgust, transferred to the new Atari Research Division under Alan Kay about a year after APX launched.|$|E
