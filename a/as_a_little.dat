5|$|Alan Gordon Partridge is {{a fictional}} {{character}} portrayed by English actor and comedian Steve Coogan. A parody of British television personalities, Partridge is a tactless and inept {{television and radio}} presenter who often insults his guests and whose inflated sense of celebrity drives him to treachery and shameless self-promotion. Coogan described Partridge <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Englander, with right-wing values and poor taste.|$|E
5|$|As {{the school}} year ends, Charlie is anxious about losing his older friends—especially Sam, who is leaving for a summer college-preparatory program and has learned that her boyfriend cheated on her. When Charlie helps her pack, they talk about his {{feelings}} for her; she is angry that he never acted on them. They begin to engage sexually, but Charlie suddenly grows inexplicably uncomfortable and stops Sam. Charlie begins to realize that his sexual contact with Sam has stirred up repressed memories of him being molested by his Aunt Helen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy. Charlie shows signs of PTSD from the incident and the revelation of his abuse helps the reader understand his view of relationships and love.|$|E
5|$|Ramprasad Sen is {{regarded}} as one of the notable figures of the bhakti movement in Bengal during the eighteenth century. He is credited with popularizing the bhakti Shakta tradition and Shyama Sangeet—devotional songs to the goddess Kali. Ramprasad was the first Shakta poet to address Kali with such intimate devotion, and to sing of her as a tender loving mother or even <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl. After him, a school of Shakta poets continued the Kali-bhakti tradition.|$|E

5|$|Cassidy Sharp (voiced by Jennifer Hale): The game's {{first female}} protagonist. Cassidy is the agent who {{attempts}} to stop Jericho {{on the train}} in the game's opening sequence. After the explosion of Lazarus' prison, she joins Jericho but is soon murdered by Lazarus. Cassidy returns as a good ghost and befriends Jericho, aiding him in his mission to stop Lazarus (a role similar to this of Cortana in the Halo series). <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl, Cassidy was orphaned in a vampire attack and then raised as a ward of the Darkwatch. Eventually, she became the most serious and dangerous agent in the organisation, yet really she is also deeply insecure about herself. If fought as the final boss, she turns into an angel.|$|E
5|$|The Cabernet Sauvignon grape {{itself is}} very small, {{with a thick}} skin, {{creating}} a high 1:12 ratio of seed (pip) to fruit (pulp). From these elements the high proportions of phenols and tannins can have a stark influence on the structure and flavor of the wine—especially if the must is subjected to long periods of maceration (skin contact) before fermentation. In Bordeaux, the maceration period was traditionally three weeks, which gave the winemaking staff enough time to close down the estate after harvest to take a hunting holiday. The results of these long maceration periods are very tannic and flavorful wines that require years of aging. Wine producers that wish to make a wine more approachable {{within a couple of}} years will drastically reduce the maceration time to <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> as a few days. Following maceration, the Cabernet must can be fermented at high temperatures up to 30 °C (86 °F). The temperature of fermentation will {{play a role in the}} result, with deeper colors and more flavor components being extracted at higher temperatures while more fruit flavors are maintained at lower temperature. In Australia there has been experimentation with carbonic maceration to make softer, fruity Cabernet Sauvignon wines.|$|E
5|$|Beth asks Mick to {{help her}} friend Morgan find her stolen cameras. When he meets her, Mick is {{completely}} shocked; Morgan is identical to his ex-wife, Coraline. He becomes even more confused when his vampiric sense of smell tells him that Morgan is human. Mick tries to expose Morgan as Coraline, but finally comes {{to believe that she}} is a doppelgänger when he sees that she does not have the fleur de lis tattoo on her shoulder as Coraline did. When alone, Morgan scrubs away the heavy makeup that has been covering the tattoo. Beth snoops through Mick's property, and finds out Mick was the one who protected her <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl when she was kidnapped. Morgan goes with Mick to his apartment to clean up after almost getting hit by a car. Mick joins her in the shower and finally sees the tattoo on her shoulder, revealing her identity as Coraline. When Beth learns that Morgan is really Coraline, the lady who kidnapped her as a child, she goes to Mick's apartment and stabs her with a wooden stake, narrowly missing her heart, not realizing that she has become human. Coraline goes to hospital, but recovers and leaves after being revealed to be a vampire again. Beth's boyfriend Josh is kidnapped by a dangerous Los Angeles–based gang. Mick and Beth witness the event and drive after him, but Josh is shot. Beth realizes that Josh is dying, and begs Mick to turn him into a vampire; he refuses and Josh dies. While putting Josh's affairs in order, Beth discovers that Josh was about to propose to her.|$|E

25|$|Mendelssohn's {{great success}} in England from 1829 {{until the end}} of his life also {{reflected}} well on his friend. Although Moscheles's music was now being looked on <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> old-fashioned, he was heavily in demand as a music teacher and included amongst his pupils many children of the rich and aristocratic classes. He was also appointed 'Pianist to Prince Albert', a sinecure which nevertheless confirmed his status.|$|E
25|$|She {{was taught}} to read {{at the age of}} three by her {{maternal}} grandmother. She would assist with getting the family's meal of rice and beans ready, and then spend the morning at a table with a primer. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl, she often pretended to be a teacher to her dolls and stuffed animals, using a small blackboard and desk. She points to this early play-time as the root of her desire to be an educator.|$|E

25|$|A mild {{form of a}} {{cleft lip}} is a {{microform}} cleft. A microform cleft can appear as small <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dent in the red part of the lip or look like a scar from the lip up to the nostril. In some cases muscle tissue in the lip underneath the scar is affected and might require reconstructive surgery. It is advised to have newborn infants with a microform cleft checked with a craniofacial team {{as soon as possible}} to determine the severity of the cleft.|$|E
25|$|Although on {{her return}} to Vienna in August 1862, a lady-in-waiting {{reported}} that “she eats properly, sleeps well, and does not tight-lace any more”, her clothing from this time until her death still measured only 18 1/2 – 19 1/2inches around the waist, which prompted the Prince of Hesse to describe her as “almost inhumanly slender.” She developed a horror of fat women and transmitted this attitude to her youngest daughter, who was terrified when, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl, she first met Queen Victoria.|$|E
25|$|From 1860–63 Huxley {{developed}} his ideas, presenting them in lectures to working men, {{students and the}} general public, followed by publication.

Other lectures grew into Huxley's most famous work Evidence as to Man's place in Nature (1863) where he addressed the key issues long before Charles Darwin published his Descent of Man in 1871.|$|E

25|$|Garrincha {{was born}} in Pau Grande, a {{district}} of Magé, {{in the state of}} Rio de Janeiro, in 1933. His father was an alcoholic, drinking cachaça heavily, a problem which Garrincha would inherit. A boy with a carefree attitude, he was smaller than other kids his age, with his sister Rosa noticing he was as small <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bird she started calling him Garrincha, the north-eastern name for the wren, a little brown bird. The name stuck and by the age of four years he was known as Garrincha to his family and friends.|$|E
25|$|Under Hart, the Bulldogs won {{just seven}} games {{in his first}} two years, but had one notable moment of glory when Kelvin Templeton won the Brownlow medal in 1980. Hart had taken on Templeton, a century-goalkicker who was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit brittle, as a {{personal}} project, getting him on a weight program and moving him to his old position at centre half forward. It seemed that Hart worked well with those who were similarly talented and motivated as himself, but struggled to relate to those who were not. This is a common refrain in Australian football: simply put, the best players don't always make the best coaches.|$|E
25|$|Sequoyah {{was born}} in the Cherokee town of Tuskegee circa 1770. James Mooney, a {{prominent}} anthropologist and historian of the Cherokee people, quoted a cousin as saying that <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy, he spent his early years with his mother. Estimates of his birth year ranged from 1760 to 1776. His name is believed to come from the Cherokee word siqua meaning 'hog'. However, Davis says the name may have been derived from sikwa (either a hog or an opossum) and vi meaning a place or an enclosure. This is a reference either to a childhood deformity or to a later injury that left Sequoyah disabled.|$|E
