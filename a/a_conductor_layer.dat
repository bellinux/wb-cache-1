Ion implantation was identified as the preferred process step for impurity doping. Unanalyzed beam ion implantation was shown to have major cost advantages over analyzed beam implantation. Further, high quality cells were fabricated using a high current unanalyzed beam. Mechanically masked plasma patterning of silicon nitride was shown to be capable of forming fine lines on silicon surfaces with spacings between mask and substrate as great as 250 micrometers. Extensive work was performed on advances in plated metallization. The need for the thick electroless palladium layer was eliminated.

There {{is a clear}} trend from fabrics or garments hosting electronic components embedded in the textile substrate to e-textiles made from yarns or fibres already possessing electronic properties. The development of passive devices, such as textile electrodes that measure body parameters is already well proceeded. However, {{there is a great}} need in developing textiles possessing active functions. We investigated the possibility to develop a textile monofilament with integrated switching and amplification functions, by depositing an organic thin film transistor (OTFT) on the monofilament with a cylindrical form.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{theoretically}} how the local {{geometry of the}} Fermi surface (FS) of <b>a</b> <b>layered</b> <b>conductor</b> can affect quantum oscillations in the thermodynamic observables. We introduce a concrete model of the FS of <b>a</b> <b>layered</b> <b>conductor.</b> The model permits us to analyze the characteristic features of quantum oscillatory phenomena in these materials which occure due to local anomalies of the Gaussian curvature of the FS. Our analysis takes into account strong interaction among quasiparticles and we study {{the effect of this}} interaction within the framework of Fermi-liquid theory.

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} an inverse method {{for determining the}} conductivity distribution of <b>a</b> flat, <b>layered</b> <b>conductor</b> using <b>a</b> multi-frequency electromagnetic sensor based on phase signature alone. Eddy current sensors are used {{in a wide range}} of non-destructive testing (NDT) applications. Single frequency sensors are very common, however, the potential of an eddy current sensor with spectroscopic techniques offer the ability to extract depth profiles and examine more fully the internal structure of the test piece. In this paper, we found a simplified model that can estimate the phase signature of a cylindrical coil above <b>a</b> <b>conductor</b> with <b>an</b> arbitrary conductivity profile. This simplified model improves the computational efficiency by many fold compared to the complete analytic solution. For inverse solution, a simplex search method was used to fit a set of multi-frequency phase values in a least-squared sense. Experimental eddy-current tests are performed by taking the difference in inductance of the coil when placed in free space and next to <b>a</b> <b>layered</b> <b>conductor</b> over the range 100 Hz- 1 MHz.

40|$|A {{palladium}} foil cathode, 50 mm in diameter, 100 µm thick {{is placed}} between two anodic palladium foils of same dimensions. <b>A</b> proton <b>conductor</b> <b>layer</b> (poly-ethyleneoxide) (PEO) and phosphoric acid) is deposited between the cathode {{and the two}} anodes. The system is placed in a chamber filled with deuterium gas, at a temperature of 75 °C. At first, deuterium fills the two anodes up to D/Pd = 0. 48 measured by pressure decrease. Then a voltage is applied between cathode and anodes, and the cathode gets loaded by D + electrochemical migration through the solid state electrolyte. Correspondingly, the pressure decreases. Loadings of up to 0. 73 have been obtained. When voltages are reversed, the cathode deloads, and the pressure in the chamber increases. This method is well suited to measure over-potentials and absolute loadings. The input power is very low, since the production of D+ ions entering the cathode is close to 100 % whereas in liquid electrolyte cells, {{a small fraction of}} the ions produced is absorbed by the cathode.

40|$|In {{applications}} such as {{organic light emitting diodes}} (OLEDs) or photovoltaic cells a homogenous voltage distribution in the large anode layer needs to be ensured by including a metal grid with <b>a</b> transparent <b>conductor</b> <b>layer.</b> To ensure sufficient conductivity, relatively thick metal lines are used, which increases the risk of electrical shorts between the anode and the cathode. For this reason an insulating layer is needed on top of the metal lines. The thick metal lines limit the choice of deposition method, since some methods such as spin coating require smooth surfaces and cannot be used for applying the insulator. Here, a spray coating process has been studied as a potential alternative deposition method to create thin resistive layers on rough surfaces. Spray coating and Joule heating has been used for the alignment of insulator films on printed metal lines. It was demonstrated that spray coating can be used to cover the printed metal lines which have high peaks on them. The spray coating forms electrically insulating layers even though the film thickness is less than the height of the peaks.

The passive UHF (Ultra-high frequency) RFID (Radio frequency identification technology) {{is one of the}} fundamental technology used for tracking animals, people and objects. Currently, an emerging area of development is the use of wearable RFID tags in health care systems. The personal healthcare systems demand information about sensed or measured biological parameters to be reliable and rapidly sent over a wireless communication link for investigation purposes. Furthermore, the communication system must be absolutely flexible, low-power, maintenance-free and low-cost in order to be utilized on different parts of the patient’s body for continuous monitoring of physiological parameters such as blood pressure, body temperature, glucose level, and respiration system. Therefore, due to the extensive need for the implementation on flexible and conformal material, researchers have been working on textile based RFID tags. One of the hottest topics is the development of electro-textile based RFID tags for body area networks. In this thesis, to measure the performance of wearable split ring antennas on electro-textile material, different split ring antennas have been developed that are materialized with two different kinds of materials such as copper and electro-textile. The development of wearable antenna is quite challenging task due to antenna material properties, environmental issues and radiation absorbing nature of human body at higher frequencies. By considering these factors, 85 % antenna-IC power transfer efficiency at 915 MHz has been achieved in body-worn configuration. Furthermore, to analyze the near body performance of developed antenna, distance between antenna and the human body has been varied, for example 2 mm, 3 mm, 5 mm and air. Moreover, to measure the performance of antenna on clothes, EPDM (Ethylene-Propylene-Diene-Monomer) substrate of different thicknesses i. e 2 mm and 5 mm have been used. From the simulated and measured results, it has been noticed that copper based split ring UHF RFID tag shows excellent match between measured and simulated results in body-worn configuration.
