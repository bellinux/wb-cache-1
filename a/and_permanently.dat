5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{his term}} in Congress, Wickliffe was thrown from a {{carriage}} <b>and</b> <b>permanently</b> crippled. Despite his injury, he remained politically active. In 1863, he ran for governor as a Peace Democrat on an anti-Lincoln platform. Military authorities considered him subversive, however, and interfered with the election; Wickliffe lost to Thomas E.

N. rajah can often be found growing in grassy undergrowth, especially among sedges.|$|E
5|$|Some {{specialized}} {{types of}} oil tankers have evolved. One {{of these is}} the naval replenishment oiler, a tanker which can fuel a moving vessel. Combination ore-bulk-oil carriers <b>and</b> <b>permanently</b> moored floating storage units are two other variations on the standard oil tanker design. Oil tankers have been involved in a number of damaging and high-profile oil spills. As a result, they are subject to stringent design and operational regulations.|$|E

From 1846, it was possible to “systematically <b>and</b> <b>permanently</b> continue the work so gloriously and so happily begun by the Morea scientific expedition” due to the creation on rue Didot, at the foot of Mount Lycabettus, of a French scientific institution, {{in the form of the}} French School at Athens.|$|E

5|$|Before urban development, {{the damage}} caused by {{overgrazing}} during the Spanish period was still considered capable of recovery. However, the completion of Interstate 5 through the middle of the San Juan Creek watershed in the 1950s transformed the area into a bedroom community for Los Angeles <b>and</b> <b>permanently</b> erased many remaining grassland, meadow and riparian zones. The percent of urbanized land increased from 3percent in 1964 to 18percent in 1988. In the 1990s, the watershed was 32 percent urbanized. With continuing development in east San Juan Capistrano and Rancho Mission Viejo, the projected growth by 2050 is 50 percent.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{continued}} to erupt in games McGraw managed. During a brawl that erupted {{during a game}} against the Detroit Tigers on August 21, 1901, McGinnity spat on umpire Tom Connolly. McGinnity was arrested for the incident <b>and</b> <b>permanently</b> suspended by AL president Ban Johnson, who wanted there to be no fighting in AL games. Johnson later cut the suspension down to 12 days after McGinnity apologized. McGinnity compiled a 26–20 record for the 1901 Orioles, and his 48 games, 39 complete games, and 382 innings pitched led the AL.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the Civil War, Union lawmakers debated various {{proposals}} for Reconstruction. Some of these called for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery nationally <b>and</b> <b>permanently.</b> On December 14, 1863, a bill proposing such an amendment was introduced by Representative James Mitchell Ashley of Ohio. Representative James F. Wilson of Iowa soon followed with a similar proposal. On January 11, 1864, Senator John B. Henderson of Missouri submitted a joint resolution for a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. The Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Lyman Trumbull of Illinois, became involved in merging different proposals for an amendment.|$|E

5|$|In the {{meantime}} fighting between the rebels and the Byzantines continued. Although the Bulgarian forces were cut in two following the Byzantine landing at Varna, heavy clashes {{erupted in the}} eastern Balkan mountains with new vigour, especially around the Kotel Pass and the Varbitsa Pass. The Bulgarian positions there were surrounded both {{from the north and}} the south. The Byzantines had to besiege and take the fortresses one by one which cost time and casualties. Many strongholds remained unconquered <b>and</b> <b>permanently</b> engaged large Byzantine forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} days of the Flamingo {{engagement}} went by smoothly. On July 1, when reporting for makeup and wardrobe before their first show of the evening, Ballard discovered an extra set of gowns and costumes that had been brought along for Cindy Birdsong. Angered, Ballard performed the first concert of the night inebriated, leading to an embarrassing on-stage incident in which her stomach was revealed when she purposely thrust it forward during a dance routine. Enraged, Gordy ordered her back to Detroit <b>and</b> <b>permanently</b> dismissed her from the group. Birdsong officially assumed her place during the second July 1 show.|$|E
5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master <b>and</b> <b>permanently</b> attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E

5|$|Dana discovers Em {{was killed}} by Lester Majak, an aging local celebrity. Majak was a {{physical}} trainer who was convinced his fitness regime would extend his life. When he began to notice his growing frailty, he researched a legend of immortality from India. A particular creek near Wausau met the requirements for the legend, and Majak murdered Em near it in a ritual to extend his life. However, Em's recent pregnancy provided additional life force and caused an imbalance that resulted in Revival Day. The imbalance is still affecting the river, and will grow to threaten all life on Earth. To restore balance, Em must give birth before she reunites with her soul <b>and</b> <b>permanently</b> dies. As she delivers her daughter, the remaining revivers merge with their souls as well.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that intelligent design is not science <b>and</b> <b>permanently</b> forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.|$|E
5|$|Gunports {{for early}} {{gunpowder}} artillery {{had begun to}} be installed in English castles during the 15th century. At Kirby Muxloe, six gunports were constructed in the ground floor walls of both the gatehouse and west tower; these were then temporarily filled with bricks, probably to prevent vermin and to limit the drafts. Several more gunports were built lower down in the gatehouse, presumably in error as they were ultimately below the waterline of the moat <b>and</b> <b>permanently</b> blocked up. The range of any guns at the castle would have been quite limited, as they were positioned relatively low to the ground. Historians are uncertain to what extent any guns at Kirby Muxloe would have been useful in a conflict. The gunports are of early design {{and may have been}} intended to be symbolic rather than practical; they were well positioned across the castle's defences, however, and might well have been intended to deter a serious attack.|$|E

5|$|In late 1992, the Dangerous Journeys RPG was {{released}} by Games Designer Workshop, but TSR immediately applied for an injunction against the entire Dangerous Journeys RPG and the Mythus setting, arguing that Dangerous Journeys was based on D and AD. Although the injunction failed, TSR moved forward with litigation. Gygax believed the legal action was without merit and fuelled by Lorraine Williams' personal enmity, but NEC and JVC both withdrew from the project, killing the Mythus computer game. By 1994, the legal costs associated with many months of pretrial discovery had drained all of Gygax's resources; believing that TSR was also suffering, Gygax offered to settle. In the end, TSR paid Gygax for the complete rights to Dangerous Journeys and Mythus. Although Gygax was well compensated for his years of work on Dangerous Journeys and Mythus, neither was ever published—TSR immediately <b>and</b> <b>permanently</b> shelved them.|$|E
5|$|Kartik struggled, taking 2/129 against East {{and then}} 0/178 {{in the first}} innings as North Zone {{accumulated}} 8/690 declared. He then had to endure the humiliation of not being trusted to bowl in the second innings as North reached 8/233. In the last match against South, Kartik could only aggregate 1/87. Although Kartik had scored 45 and 27 in his two innings, he totalled only three Duleep Trophy wickets {{at an average of}} 131.33. The selectors were unsatisfied by these performances, and despite a shoulder injury to Kumble, Kartik was discarded as India hosted Australia in the 2001 Border Gavaskar Trophy. Harbhajan was recalled and took 32 wickets at 17 to engineer an Indian series win <b>and</b> <b>permanently</b> establish himself as India's leading spinner alongside Kumble. Kartik played in one more match for Railways {{at the end of the}} season, and his poor season continued, managing only a total of 2/152, although he did score 79 with the bat.|$|E
5|$|The New Year {{began with}} a second defeat of the season to Burton, this time being beaten 3–1 at home, in which Brodie scored {{in the first half}} with a shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area. Wrexham defender Kyle Critchell was signed on a one-month loan, who Foyle knew while he was a coach at the club. Adam Smith {{returned}} to Gainsborough following the conclusion of his loan, while a permanent move had been stalled as Gainsborough were holding out for a fee. Progression to the third round of the FA Trophy was ensured with a 2–1 away victory over Oxford, with goals from McBreen and Brodie. Further signings from Wrexham took place when striker Simon Brown and midfielder Christian Smith signed on loan <b>and</b> <b>permanently</b> respectively. Hirst was released having failed to break into the first team. Lewes were beaten 3–0 at home; Brodie opened the scoring with a volley into the top corner from outside the penalty area, and Christian Smith scored from 30yards before Brodie finished the scoring with a low shot into the bottom corner. Henderson was released having fallen out of the reckoning for a first-team place.|$|E
