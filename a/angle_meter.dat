50|$|A {{timing light}} {{may be a}} {{self-contained}} instrument, but is sometimes combined with a voltmeter, RPM meter, and a dwell <b>angle</b> <b>meter,</b> or may be incorporated into a more comprehensive instrument such as an engine analyser. Self-contained units used to time automotive engines have an inductive pickup that clamps around the proper spark plug wire and serves as the trigger for the strobe. Power for the strobe comes directly from the vehicle's battery. Some older timing lights require {{the removal of the}} spark plug boot in order to attach a direct pickup between the wire's terminal and the centre conductor of the spark plug.|$|E
50|$|An ideal {{hydrophobic}} surface {{would have a}} contact angle of 180 degrees to water. This means that the hydrocarbons lie flat against the surface creating a thin layer and preventing dampening water absorption. However, in practice it is fine or even preferred to have {{a low level of}} dampening water absorption because of a phenomenon that occurs when water settles at the surface of paper. This phenomenon is when ink is unable to transfer to the paper because of the water layer at the surface. The contact angle value for hydrocarbons on a rough pigment-coated paper can be found to be approximately 110° through a contact <b>angle</b> <b>meter.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Emittance is a {{property}} of a charged particle beam in a particle accelerator. It {{is a measure}} for the average spread of particle coordinates in position-and-momentum phase space and has the dimension of length (e.g., meters) or length times <b>angle</b> (<b>meters</b> times radians). As a particle beam propagates along magnets and other beam-manipulating components of an accelerator, the position spread may change, {{but in a way}} that does not change the emittance. If the distribution over phase space is represented as a cloud in a plot (see figure), emittance is the area of the cloud. A more exact definition handles the fuzzy borders of the cloud and the case of a cloud that does not have an elliptical shape.|$|R

The introduction of VTES into the PVA matrix resulted in a decrease in the crystalline and an increase in compactness and thermal stability of the as-prepared membranes. Silica hybridization reduced the swelling of the as-prepared membranes in water/ethanol/ethyl acetate mixtures, decreased the permeation flux, and remarkably enhanced water permselectivity in pervaporation dehydration of ethanol/ethyl acetate aqueous solution.

50|$|One {{way that}} Holtermann wanted to {{directly}} support the main war effort in Norway was to bombard Værnes Air Base, the northernmost airfield in German hands and vital {{for the support}} of German forces north of Trondheim. This was particularly so for the Narvik front, which could not be reached by aircraft flying from further south than Værnes. Recognising this, the Germans had hired some 2,000 Norwegian collaborationist labourers to work full-time at expanding and improving the air strip. Bombarding Værnes would both have disrupted this work and impaired the bombing raids being flown against Norwegian forces fighting further to the north. However, since Værnes is 11.5 km from Hegra, and the fortress' guns only had a maximum range of some 9 km, this was impossible. For accurate firing, the effective range was a mere 6.9 km, as that was the range of the artillery's height <b>angle</b> <b>meter.</b> Efforts were made at the fortress to increase the elevation of the guns from 19° to 26° by removing part of the gun shields, and part of the gun mounting, but these failed as no welding equipment could be acquired to carry out the modifications. Even though no modifications could be carried out, one of the 10.5 cm guns at Hegra opened fire in the direction of Værnes on 22 April. With the gun firing at maximum elevation, the rounds still fell hundreds of metres short of their intended target.|$|E
