Animals experience {{many of the same}} effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Animals are used to test the effects of treatments, such as chelating agents, and to provide information on the pathophysiology of lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.|$|E
25|$|I want to {{conclude}} with a few remarks about the domestic scene {{and the role of}} Social Democrats, U.S.A. in it. We are not a political party with our own candidates. We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> our specific programs for more employment, more insurance, more welfare, less discrimination, less bureaucratic inefficiency. Our spiritual task should be to relate these programs and demands to the underlying philosophy of democracy, to express and defend those larger moral ideals that should inform, programs for which we wish to develop popular support.|$|E
25|$|Serious {{diseases}} {{can affect}} the Leonberger—certain types of cancers are very common in the breed. Gastric dilatation volvulus, commonly called bloat, is another serious condition that affects many of the large and giant breed dogs, particularly those with deep chests. It causes the stomach to twist and can be fatal quite quickly. Adult Leonbergers should always be fed twice a day rather than one large meal {{in order to reduce}} the likelihood of bloat. Leonbergers <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> inheriting serious diseases and according to the University of Sydney's LIDA taskforce, Leonbergers have relatively few health issues compared to other dog breeds.|$|E

25|$|On the 11th of March 2017 the Dutch {{government}} has made a decision which changed the relationship between both countries for worse. When the Turks decided to sent the minister of foreign affairs for the 400.000 Turks living in the Netherlands, to have them vote for the Turkish constitutional referendum, the Dutch government denied access into the Netherlands. Later that day minister of family affairs Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya traveled by road to the Netherlands but was escorted {{out of the country}} on orders of the Dutch government. This led to problems in Rotterdam where Dutch police used dogs and water cannon on Sunday to disperse demonstrators. The Dutch <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> this decision, The Netherlands, Austria, Germany, Denmark and Switzerland all have denied the Turkish government to rally in their countries for the referendum.|$|E

2500|$|Greek {{organizations}} both {{nationally and}} locally sponsor many risk avoidance {{programs for the}} real benefits of student safety and well-being, {{as well as to}} avoid harmful bad publicity. Hence, these organizations have learned to address criticism quickly: Chapters and national bodies have adopted extensive changes to reduce incidents of hazing and other harmful behaviors. The recent announcement by Sigma Alpha Epsilon to ban [...] "pledging" [...] nationwide is only the latest of such announcements, of revised prospective member programs now adopted by many fraternities. While not limited to fraternities and sororities, harmful activities like underage drinking and hazing are often headlined as local news stories, with fraternity chapters as the most visible examples. [...] In this area too, active and alumni Greek leaders have responded to such negative publicity and the resulting criticism with programs that seek to reduce alcohol abuse and eliminate underage or binge drinking, with risk management training, by self-policing their own chapters, and with more stringent procedures to discipline offenders. All sororities and some fraternity chapters have banned alcohol in their living facilities. National fraternities, through the NIC and sororities through their national and local governing boards require member training each year to combat hazing, underage drinking, sexual assault and other harmful behaviors. Hence, individual chapters <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> addressing these problems. Inter-chapter governing boards at Minnesota (listed below by chapter groupings) provide event monitoring services and local risk management training, culminating in the introduction in 2012 of Arkeo, which serves as an inter-Greek cooperative monitoring program to help chapters avoid risk.|$|E

60|$|Let it {{be remembered}} that aged poverty {{is not the only}} evil with which, so far as our means allow, we have to grapple. What is the problem of the hour?

A reaction from overtrading is general all over the world. Both Germany and the United States are suffering from a similar commercial contraction, and in both countries, in spite of their high and elaborate protective tariffs, a trade set-back has been accompanied by severe industrial dislocation and unemployment. In the United States of America, particularly, I am informed that unemployment has recently been more general than in this country. Indeed the financial collapse in the United States last autumn has been the most clearly marked of all the causes to which the present trade depression may be assigned.|$|E

The souls of apes, monkeys, reptiles and creeping things haunt the passages and attics and cellars of this living house in which your consciousness has awakened...." ...|$|E

It rained, and I was crossing the Carrousel in a fiacre, when I saw Canova stealing along near the walls, covered in a cloak, and apparently uncertain how to proceed. I drove near him, and offered him a seat. He was agitated, and appeared like a man who had stolen goods about him. The amount of it was, that they were distributing the pictures to their former owners, and having an order to receive [...] "la Madonna della Seggiola," [...] he had laid hands on the prize, and, in his eagerness to make sure of it, was carrying it off, under his cloak. He was afraid of being discovered and mobbed, and so I drove home with him to his hotel."
