50|$|Modding may {{sometimes}} infringe the legal {{rights of the}} copyright owner. Some nations have laws prohibiting modding and accuse modders of attempting to overcome copy protection schemes. In the United States, the DMCA has set up stiff penalties for mods that violate the rights of intellectual property owners. In the European Union, member states have agreed the EU Copyright Directive and are transposing it into national law. A 22-year-old man was convicted by Caerphilly Magistrates' Court in the United Kingdom in July 2005 for selling a modded Xbox with built in software and games. However it is also worthy of note that some other European countries have not interpreted the legal issues in the same way. In Italy a judge threw out a Sony case saying {{it was up to}} owners of a console what they did with it. Similarly in Spain, mod chips have been ruled as legal despite the EU copyright legislation. Modding may be an unauthorized change made to <b>a</b> <b>software</b> <b>or</b> <b>hardware</b> to a platform in gaming. Case mods are modifications to a device with the altering of certain styles.

40|$|In {{the modern}} design environments, {{different}} modules, available in existent libraries, may obey different architectural styles and execution models. Reaching a well– behaved composition of such modules {{is a very}} important task of the system designer. In the framework of the action systems formalism, we analyze the co-existence of two models of execution, one synchronized, the other, interleaved. We devise a communication scheme, similar to the classical paradigm of polling, which allows us to model synchronized components that correctly exchange information, within the borders of a global system, with their non-synchronized partners. Derivations of such mechanisms follow specific correctness rules for refinement. We illustrate our methods on an audio system example, implementable as either <b>a</b> <b>software</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>hardware</b> device...|$|R

40|$|We propose and {{evaluate}} an immuno-inspired approach to misbehavior detection in ad hoc wireless networks. Node misbehavior {{can be the}} result of an intrusion, or <b>a</b> <b>software</b> <b>or</b> <b>hardware</b> failure. Our approach is motivated by co-stimulatory signals present in the Biological immune system. The results show that co-stimulation in ad hoc wireless networks can both substantially improve energy efficiency of detection and, at the same time, help achieve low false positives rates. The energy efficiency improvement is almost two orders of magnitude, if compared to misbehavior detection based on watchdogs. We provide a characterization of the trade-offs between detection approaches executed by a single node and by several nodes in cooperation. Additionally, we investigate several feature sets for misbehavior detection. These feature sets impose different requirements on the detection system, most notably from the energy efficiency point of view. Comment: 15 page...|$|E
