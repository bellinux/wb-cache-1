25|$|The RocketFest {{has been}} held every June since 2008. Rocket {{building}} workshops will run every 3 hours starting at 9 a.m. and ending at 6 p.m. Assistance is available to help assemble the model rocket, prepare the engine, and launch the rocket. Reservations are necessary to hold a place {{in one of the}} workshops and to pre-order the type of rocket including Standard rockets (A- or B-powered), suitable for younger children and beginning rocket builders, and Advanced rockets (D-powered) have stronger engines and <b>are</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> those with more experience.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to {{weightlessness}} causes {{changes to}} the signals from the receptors to touch, pressure, and gravity, i.e., all information necessary for postural stability. Adaptive modifications in the central processing of sensory information take place to produce motor responses that <b>are</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> the new gravitational environment. As a result, terrestrial motor strategies are progressively abandoned in weightlessness, as astronauts adapt to the weightless environment. This is particularly true for the major postural muscles found in the lower legs. The modifications in posture, movement, and locomotion acquired in reduced gravity are then inappropriate for Earth's gravity upon return. After landing, postural instability approaching clinical ataxia is manifested {{as a result of}} this in-flight neural reorganization.|$|E
25|$|Different {{gears and}} ranges of gears <b>are</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> {{different}} people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow gear selection {{to suit the}} circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. In a lower gear every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.|$|E

25|$|In some fonts, if the {{lowercase}} letters fi {{are placed}} adjacently, the dot-like {{upper end of}} the f would fall inconveniently close to the dot of the i, and therefore a ligature glyph is provided with the top of the f extended to serve as the dot of the i. A similar ligature for ffi is also possible. Since the unligatured forms are unattractive and the ligatures make the i dotless, such fonts are not appropriate for use in a Turkish setting. However, the fi ligatures of some fonts do not merge the letters and instead space them next to each other, with the dot on the i remaining. Such fonts <b>are</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> Turkish, but the writer must be careful to be consistent in the use of ligatures.|$|E
25|$|The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada {{state that}} {{properly}} planned vegan diets <b>are</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> all life stages, including pregnancy and lactation. They indicate that vegetarian diets {{may be more}} common among adolescents with eating disorders, but that its adoption may serve to camouflage a disorder rather than cause one. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council similarly recognizes a well-planned vegan diet as viable for any age. The British National Health Service's Eatwell Plate allows for an entirely plant-based diet, as does the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) MyPlate. The USDA allows tofu to replace meat in the National School Lunch Program. The German Society for Nutrition does not recommend a vegan diet for babies, children and adolescents, and for those pregnant or breastfeeding.|$|E

[...] According to Vettel, the prices are respectable given the overall experience. Sixteen has a bar that Kamin complains has limited views, but that Chicago Tribune restaurant critic Phil Vettel says was pleasant.|$|E

500|$|ASL is {{distinguished}} by its requirement that all second-year students complete a mandatory Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) class. [...] The school has also held ADR training in local schools; this program drew national attention, particularly from former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, who has publicly congratulated the school on this effort. Students are given {{an overview of}} different types of conflict resolutions, particularly mediation, negotiation, and arbitration. Ethical issues are explored in addition to legal and policy ramifications. Students learn {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each method of dispute resolution and learn which methods <b>are</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> certain situations.|$|E

Frequently, the Council has criticized programs on BET, Comedy Central, E!, FX, MTV, Spike, TNT, and VH1 because they claim some of the content aired on those channels is inappropriate for younger viewers. On {{the other side of}} the issue, the PTC has awarded its [...] "Seal of Approval" [...] to cable networks Disney Channel and Hallmark Channel for their original programs several years ago.|$|E
