5|$|Bryce Dallas Howard (born March 2, 1981) is an American film actress, director, producer, and writer. Howard {{attended}} New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, {{but left}} before graduating {{to take on}} roles on Broadway. During a performance of <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It where Howard portrayed Rosalind, she {{caught the attention of}} director M. Night Shyamalan, and he cast her in what would be her breakout film, the psychological thriller The Village (2004) and then in the fantasy thriller Lady in the Water (2006). Her performance in Kenneth Branagh’s film adaptation of <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It (2006) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination. In 2006 she co-wrote and directed the short film Orchids.|$|E
5|$|For several years, Howard {{appeared}} in New York plays. Among these were House & Garden, a 2002 Alan Ayckbourn production {{held at the}} Manhattan Theatre Club, in which she portrayed a disdainful, flirtatious teen. While performing as Rosalind in the critically acclaimed 2003 William Shakespeare comedy production <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It at The Public Theater, Howard {{caught the eye of}} director M. Night Shyamalan.|$|E

Travel as many miles <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> and go where you will, it is highly {{improbable}} that you will find a spot with so many magnificent nature advantages as has St. Johns. The fine stretch of level land on which the city is located, the deep water of the two rivers, the navigable sloughs and the superb scenery which nature has painted with a master hand, makes the location an ideal one in every respect either for industries or residences.|$|E

60|$|LADY BRITOMART. Treat <b>you</b> <b>as</b> a child! What do you mean? It is most unkind and ungrateful {{of you to}} {{say such}} a thing.

5|$|Hordern came to {{prominence}} in the early 1950s when he {{took part in a}} theatrical competition at the Arts Theatre in London. There, he impressed Glen Byam Shaw who secured the actor a season-long contract at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre where he played major parts, including Caliban in The Tempest, Jaques in <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It, and Sir Politick Would-Be in Ben Jonson's comedy Volpone. The following season Hordern joined Michael Benthall's company at the Old Vic where, among other parts, he played Polonius in Hamlet, and the title role in King John. In 1958 he won a best actor award at that year's British Academy Television Awards for his role as the barrister in John Mortimer's courtroom drama The Dock Brief. Along with his theatrical responsibilities Hordern had regular minor roles in various films including Cleopatra (1963), and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966).|$|E
25|$|The role {{is thought}} to have been first played by Robert Armin, who {{typically}} played intelligent clown roles like Touchstone in <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It or Feste in Twelfth Night.|$|E
25|$|A statue {{was created}} for Logan Circle, Philadelphia in 1926, {{designed}} by Alexander Stirling Calder. It does not depict Shakespeare himself, but rather the figures of Touchstone the jester from <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It, representing comedy, and Hamlet, representing tragedy. Touchstone is lounging with his head tilted laughing, his feet hanging {{over the top of}} the tall stone pedestal and his left arm resting on Hamlet's legs. Hamlet is seated, brooding, his knife dangling over Touchstone's body. The opening lines of the famous All the world's a stage speech from <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It are inscribed on the pedestal beneath the figures.|$|E

25|$|In William Shakespeare's Macbeth, Hecate {{appears as}} {{the queen of}} witches, uniquely placing the Anglo-Saxon witches under a Greek goddess's control. Hymen appears as a {{character}} name in his <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It.|$|E
25|$|The Prodigal Son {{was also}} {{referred}} to in the play <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It, a pastoral comedy by William Shakespeare. The Prodigal Son is also mentioned in Shakespeare's romance, The Winter's Tale (Act 4, Scene 4 line 89).|$|E

60|$|We {{made a very}} creditable supper. I {{explained}} to B. the ballast principle held by my seafaring friend, and he agreed with me that the idea seemed reasonable; and, as there was a fixed price for supper, and <b>you</b> had <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>liked,</b> we determined to give the plan a fair trial.|$|R
25|$|Later, he {{performed}} in such pieces as Princess Charming (1926) and appeared {{in at least}} ten films for London Film Productions Ltd., among other films, in the 1930s. He produced The Land of Smiles and Cavalcade (both in 1931), and in 1933, he played Touchstone in a production of <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{tradition}} that Shakespeare, in addition to writing many of the plays his company enacted and concerned with business and financial details as part-owner of the company, continued to act in various parts, such as the ghost of Hamlet's father, Adam in <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It, and the Chorus in Henry V.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, Worth {{demonstrated}} her exceptional versatility {{by playing}} in the farce Hotel Paradiso in London with Alec Guinness, high tragedy {{in the title role}} of Schiller's Mary Stuart, co-starring Eva Le Gallienne; and on Broadway and Shakespearean comedy in <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It at Stratford, Ontario.

25|$|Whatever {{the reason}} for his departure, Kempe was {{replaced}} by Robert Armin, formerly of Chandos's Men and an author in his own right. Small and fanciful, Armin offered significantly different options for Shakespeare, and the change is seen in the last Elizabethan and first Jacobean plays. Armin is generally credited with originating such characters as Feste in Twelfth Night, Touchstone in <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It, and the fool in King Lear.|$|E
25|$|Her {{first tour}} of the United States (accompanied by Gebhard) was an {{enormous}} success, which she repeated in subsequent years. While the critics generally condemned her interpretations of roles such as Pauline in The Lady of Lyons or Rosalind in <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It, the public loved her. After her return from New York in 1883, Langtry registered at the Conservatoire in Paris for six weeks' intensive training to improve her acting technique.|$|E

25|$|Although Armin {{typically}} played these intelligent clown roles, it {{has been}} suggested by a few scholars that he originated the role of Iago in Othello, on the grounds that Iago sings two drinking songs (most of the songs in Shakespeare's plays from 1600 to 1610 were sung by Armin's characters) and that this was the sole play between <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It and Timon of Athens that has no fool or clown for Armin to play.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, he {{arranged}} incidental music from Elizabethan sources for <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It at Stratford-on-Avon, and conducted {{a series of}} Sunday concerts at Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, where he also conducted Pergolesi's opera La serva padrona. Viola Tree's production of The Tempest at the Aldwych Theatre in 1921, interspersed incidental music by Thomas Arne and Arthur Sullivan, with new music by Bliss for an ensemble of male voices, piano, trumpet, trombone, gongs and five percussionists dispersed through the theatre.|$|E
25|$|She later {{toured the}} country with Robert L. Downing in classic parts. In 1889 she {{appeared}} in her first Shakespeare play, <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> It, at Augustin Daly's theater. During {{the course of the}} early 1890s she was managed by Daniel Frohman and appeared in his stock company. From 1892 to 1894 her career was managed by Daniel's brother, Charles Frohman. For a short period during 1891, and in between Frohman brothers, she was under the aegis of A. M. Palmer.|$|E
