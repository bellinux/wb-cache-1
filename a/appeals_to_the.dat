5|$|As well as <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Exchequer Chamber, {{the court}} also allowed <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords, which was first used in 1660 for the case of Fanshawe v Impey and {{confirmed}} in 1677.|$|E
5|$|Each {{in their}} own way is making the same point, that Bewick's work is more than mere illustration. Its liveliness and truth to {{experience}} <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> imagination of the reader and calls forth an individual response that goes beyond the text.|$|E
5|$|The {{availability}} of criminal <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court {{by means of}} writs of error from the circuit courts was perhaps an open question prior to More. In England, the writ of error was available as of right in misdemeanor cases, but, in felony cases, required the express consent of the prosecutor.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} {{court is}} the Royal Court, with <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jersey Court of Appeal and, ultimately, to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The Bailiff {{is head of}} the judiciary; the Bailiff and the Deputy Bailiff are appointed by the Crown. Other members of the island's judiciary are appointed by the Bailiff.|$|E
5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced to be executed. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the {{confession}} was forced, and <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. Amid objections against the fairness of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign.|$|E
5|$|Bristol sent three {{ships to}} the Royal Navy fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and also {{supplied}} two levies {{of men to}} the defending land forces. Despite <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Privy Council no reimbursement was made for these supplies. The corporation also had to repair the walls and gates of the city. The castle had fallen into disuse in the late Tudor era, but the City authorities {{had no control over}} royal property and the precincts became a refuge for lawbreakers.|$|E

5|$|Burton v. United States is {{the name}} of two <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court of the United States by Senator Joseph R. Burton (R-KS) {{following}} his conviction for compensated representation of a party in a proceeding in which the United States was interested: Burton v. United States, 196 U.S. 283 (1905) and Burton v. United States, 202 U.S. 344 (1906). Burton was convicted of acting as counsel to Rialto Grain and Securities Company in the United States Postmaster General's investigation of Rialto for mail fraud.|$|E
5|$|Drysdale also {{oversaw the}} first civil {{litigation}} trial, {{in which the}} owners of the two ships sought damages from each other. His decision (27 April 1918) found Mont-Blanc entirely at fault. Subsequent <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court of Canada (19 May 1919), and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London (22 March 1920), determined Mont-Blanc and Imo were equally to blame for navigational errors that led to the collision. No party was ever convicted for any crime or otherwise successfully prosecuted for any actions that precipitated the disaster.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1983, Virginia Tech was placed on {{probation}} by the NCAA for violations stemming from illegal benefits given to players and potential recruits. The probation's main effect was to ban the players who received the benefits from participating in any postseason game following the 1984 season. Seven of the eight players involved in the scandal either left Virginia Tech or had the probation lifted {{as a result of}} <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NCAA. The eighth, Bruce Smith, did not.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{case was}} <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which affirmed the lower court's decision, {{although}} three judges dissented. The case was then <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court.|$|R
50|$|Andreotti was {{completely}} acquitted at first instance, again on <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Court of <b>Appeals,</b> and finally on <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Court of Cassation in 2004. None of the accusations held up.|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{the appellate}} {{provision}} of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the appellate {{provision of the}} act of February 27, 1801 was not explicitly limited to civil cases (except insofar as it incorporated the former by reference). Further, because the D.C. circuit court was not constituted {{within the framework of}} the Judiciary Act of 1802, <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court by way of certificates of division could not issue. After More, the Marshall Court heard six appeals from the D.C. circuit court via original habeas.|$|E
5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents {{the reader with}} a choice between two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical way of life over the aesthetic only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical way of life. Suggesting the aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted {{the idea that there}} is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic way of life only <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must choose, and through one's choices, one creates what one is.|$|E
5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced to be {{executed}} only a month later, {{on the basis of a}} confession gained during interrogation, although he had protested his innocence in pidgin English. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. A linguist who investigated the case thought that the style of English in the confession was inconsistent with Stuart's background and speech. This aroused disquiet and objections against the fairness of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, and The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign. Soon, the case attracted international attention, some on the assumption that the legal system was racist. The former High Court Justice Sir John Latham also spoke out.|$|E
50|$|In the High Court, {{his claim}} was {{dismissed}} by the judge, but on <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Court of <b>Appeal,</b> it was overturned, being awarded $300,000 in damages. Rowling <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Privy Council.|$|R
50|$|In New Zealand, <b>the</b> {{right of}} <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Privy Council was {{abolished}} following {{the passing of}} the Supreme Court Act (2003). A right of <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Privy Council remains for criminal cases which were decided before the Supreme Court was created, but {{it is likely that the}} successful appeal by Mark Lundy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Privy Council in 2013 will be <b>the</b> last <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Board from New Zealand.|$|R
5000|$|The {{case was}} an {{automatic}} <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> court under California Penal Code § 1239b, which provides {{that in the}} case of a death sentence, the case is automatically <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> State Supreme Court.|$|R
5|$|Although {{no longer}} {{formally}} the Count of Cotentin, Henry continued {{to control the}} west of Normandy. The struggle between Henry's brothers continued. William Rufus continued to put down resistance to his rule in England, but began to build a number of alliances against Robert with barons in Normandy and neighbouring Ponthieu. Robert allied himself with Philip I of France. In late 1090 William Rufus encouraged Conan Pilatus, a powerful burgher in Rouen, to rebel against Robert; Conan was supported by most of Rouen and made <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neighbouring ducal garrisons to switch allegiance as well.|$|E
5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> value of nonhuman animals {{have failed to}} be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can {{be the basis of}} political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 {{election}} Bruce's {{government was}} returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections. Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. James Scullin had assumed {{the leadership of the}} ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and the party was invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis. This doctrine was the basis of his <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public for the next year and a half.|$|E

50|$|In the District Court, {{the judge}} {{considered}} {{that there was}} insufficient evidence of intent <b>to</b> intimidate and <b>the</b> charge was amended to one of behaving in a disorderly manner contrary to s 4(1)(a) of the Summary Offences Act 1981. On that count of disorderly behaviour Brooker was found guilty and his <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> High Court was dismissed. Brookers <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Court of <b>Appeal</b> was also dismissed. Brooker <b>appealed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court.|$|R
5|$|Benjamin Disraeli adopted one-nation {{conservatism}} {{for both}} ethical and electoral reasons. Before he became {{leader of the}} Conservative Party, Disraeli had announced that, {{as a result of}} the Reform Act 1867 which had enfranchised the male working-class, the party needed to pursue social reforms if it were to have electoral success. One-nationism would both improve the conditions of the poor and portray the Liberal Party as selfish individualists. Because the party portrayed itself as a national (and not class-based) party, it's members were unsure whether to make specific <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> working-classes. A more positive approach to the working-class by the party developed later out of the electoral necessity to secure working-class votes.|$|E
5|$|Detective Mike Banner invites Chris for an {{interview}} {{in relation to the}} murder. Beforehand, Chris throws Mrs. Eastby's jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance her ring bounces on the railing and falls to the pavement. At the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively. He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder, and <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> detectives not to involve him further in their investigation as news of the affair may end his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby.|$|E
