40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the ability of}} the Azimuth Discrimination and Resynthesis algorithm (<b>ADRess)</b> to separate multiple speech signals from two mixtures in a simulation environment. <b>ADRess</b> exploits the spatial signature of each of the contributing speech sources to demix the mixtures. Speech sentences taken from the TIMIT database and noise signals from the NOISEX database were mixed synthetically to create pairs of mixtures. <b>ADRess</b> can exploit the spatial signature of noise and speech sources to remove or isolate them from a mixture. To simulate the spatial location of different sources the relative attenuation and phase difference of each source between the two mixtures were manipulated. This was performed for numerous different angles of arrival so as to robustly test the algorithm. Objective measures and promising informal listening test results show the suitability of <b>ADRess</b> for cleaning noisy speech mixtures and document the performance of <b>ADRess</b> for speech mixtures with different numbers of sources...|$|R

40|$|Background There {{has been}} done few studies {{on the subject of}} the {{complexity}} of consultations i a general practitioner s office. Some have done research on the number of problems <b>adressed</b> during a concultation. There has however been little research done on the nature of the problems <b>adressed.</b> Objective The purpose of this study was to describe the complexity of the problems raised at a GP s office. We also wanted to examine what patients regard as the most important factor when they go to see their GP. Methods This is a cross-sectional study, which involves observations of consultations in general practice. We registered the number of problems <b>adressed,</b> the nature of the problems, who intitiated to talk about the problem and if handling of the problem was postponed. We also used questionnaires to ask patients what they found to be most important when seeing their GP. Results We observed 201 consultations. On average, 2, 6 problems were observed during an encounter. In almost one fourth of the consultations, more than three problem were <b>adressed.</b> At least one psychic problem was raised in over one fourth of the consultations. Females raised more problems compared to men. There was also a positive relationship between age and number of problems addressed. We collected 177 answered questionnaires. Patients regard it as most important to be able to talk about all their problems during a consultation. Conclusion It is common to address multiple problems during consultations at the GP s office. The problems are often not medically related. Patients regard it as important to talk about all their problems. This requires a unique competence of the GP. Our findings will have implications for future research on general practice and in the education of GPs...|$|E

40|$|This thesis work {{is devoted}} to the {{conceptual}} and technical development of the Adaptive Resolution Scheme (<b>AdResS),</b> a molecular dynamics method that allows the simulation of a system with different levels of resolution simultaneously. The simulation domain is divided into high and low resolution zones and a transition region that links them, through which molecules can freely diffuse. The first issue of this work regards the thermodynamic consistency of the method, which is tested and verified in a modelliquid of tetrahedral molecules. The results allow the introduction of the concept of the Thermodynamic Force, an external field able to correct spurious density fluctuations present in the transition region in usual <b>AdResS</b> simulations. The <b>AdResS</b> is also applied to a system where two different representations with the same degree of resolution are confronted. This simple test extends the method from an Adaptive Resolution Scheme toan Adaptive Representation Scheme, providing a way of coupling different force fields based on thermodynamic consistency arguments. The Thermodynamic Force is successfully applied to the example described in this wor k as well. An alternative approach of deducing the Thermodynamic Force from pressure consistency considerations allows the interpretation of <b>AdResS</b> as a first step towards a molecular dynamics simulation in the Grand Canonical ensemble. Additionally, such a definition leads to a practical way of determining the Thermodynamic Force, tested in the well studied tetrahedralliquid. The effects of <b>AdResS</b> and this correction on the atomistic domain are analyzed by inspecting the local distribution of velocities, radial distribution functions, pressure and particle number fluctuation. Their comparison with analogous results coming from purely atomistic simulations shows good agreement, which is greatly improved under the effect of the external field. A further step in the development of <b>AdResS,</b> necessary for several applications in biophysics and material science, consists of its application to multicomponent systems. To this aim, the high-resolution representation of a model binary mixture is confronted with its coarse-grained representation systematically parametrized. The Thermodynamic Force, whose development requires a more delicate treatment, also gives satisfactory results. Finally, <b>AdResS</b> is tested in systems including two-body bonded forces, through the simulation of a model polymer allowed to adaptively change its representation. It is shown that the distribution functions that characterize the polymer structure are in practice not affected by the change of resolution. The technical details of the implementation of <b>AdResS</b> in the ESPResSo package conclude this thesis work. This thesis work {{is devoted to}} the conceptual and technical development of the Adaptive Resolution Scheme (<b>AdResS),</b> a molecular dynamics method thatallows the simulation of a system with different levels of resolution simultaneously.
