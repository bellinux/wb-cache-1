5|$|Over the bridges, the new key is set {{fully in}} the minor mode, {{avoiding}} the Dorian inflections present in previous Harrison songs. These sections begin on <b>an</b> <b>E</b> minor chord, which, in Roman numeral analysis, represents a v minor in the tonic of A and an iv minor in the new key. At {{the end of each}} bridge, the return to the home key is effected via <b>an</b> <b>E</b> major chord, marking the only use of the expected G note in the A major scale.|$|E

5|$|Haydn's {{choice of}} D major for this quartet, {{with the second}} {{movement}} in D minor, optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set. The first movement opens peculiarly: the first violin starts on <b>an</b> <b>E,</b> and proceeds to play a four-measure phrase that concludes with a D major chord. The use of a closing phrase to start the movement {{is the first of}} a number of unsettling incidents in the movement. The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition ends. And the movement itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves more as a link to the D-minor Adagio than a proper conclusion.|$|E

We {{analyze the}} {{dynamics}} of a deterministic model of inhibitory neuronal networks proving that the discontinuities of the Poincaré map produce a never empty chaotic set, while its continuity pieces produce stable orbits.

The <b>a.</b> <b>e.</b> stable are periodic and chaos appears as bifurcations. We prove that <b>a.</b> <b>e.</b> stable systems exhibit limit cycles, attracting <b>a.</b> <b>e.</b> the orbits...|$|R

5|$|The first {{complete}} DNA {{sequence of}} <b>an</b> <b>E.</b> coli genome (laboratory strain K-12 derivative MG1655) {{was published in}} 1997. It {{was found to be}} a circular DNA molecule 4.6 million base pairs in length, containing 4288 annotated protein-coding genes (organized into 2584 operons), seven ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons, and 86 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Despite having been the subject of intensive genetic analysis for about 40 years, a large number of these genes were previously unknown. The coding density was found to be very high, with a mean distance between genes of only 118 base pairs. The genome was observed to contain a significant number of transposable genetic elements, repeat elements, cryptic prophages, and bacteriophage remnants.|$|E
5|$|The {{orchestra}} frequently {{includes two}} clarinetists playing individual parts—each player is usually {{equipped with a}} pair of standard clarinets in B and A, and clarinet parts commonly alternate between B and A instruments several times {{over the course of a}} piece, or less commonly, a movement (e.g., 1st movement Brahms' 3rd symphony). Clarinet sections grew larger during the last few decades of the 19th century, often employing a third clarinetist, <b>an</b> <b>E</b> or a bass clarinet. In the 20th century, composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, and Olivier Messiaen enlarged the clarinet section on occasion to up to nine players, employing many different clarinets including the E or D soprano clarinets, basset horn, alto clarinet, bass clarinet, and/or contrabass clarinet.|$|E
5|$|The use of interferon, which {{requires}} injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting PEGylated interferon, which is injected only once weekly. However, some individuals {{are much more}} likely to respond than others, and this might be because of the genotype of the infecting virus or the person's heredity. The treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, thereby reducing the viral load (the amount of virus particles as measured in the blood). Response to treatment differs between the genotypes. Interferon treatment may produce <b>an</b> <b>e</b> antigen seroconversion rate of 37% in genotype A but only a 6% seroconversion in type D. Genotype B has similar seroconversion rates to type A while type C seroconverts only in 15% of cases. Sustained e antigen loss after treatment is ~45% in types A and B but only 25–30% in types C and D.|$|E
