In terms of editorial policy on theology, the Repository was largely concerned with rational dissent. Considered {{as a political}} journal, it was radical, supporting a platform of: <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>monopolies</b> (including the Corn Laws); abolition of slavery; repeal of [...] "taxes on knowledge"; extension of suffrage; national education; reform of the Church of England; and changes to the Poor Laws.|$|E
5000|$|The Treaty of Balta Liman was a {{commercial}} treaty signed in 1838 between the Ottoman Empire and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, regulating international trade. Duties were set at 3% on imports; 3% on exports; 9% on transiting exported goods; and 2% on transiting imported goods. Given {{the tradition of}} the [...] "Most Favored Country Status," [...] these conditions were extended to France. The Ottomans also agreed to the abolition of all monopolies. Factors that helped shape the treaty included the writings of David Urquhart, who had advocated for the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>monopolies</b> (of which opium was the most prominent outside of Egypt) in order to bolster further trade with the Ottoman Empire and decrease British dependency on Russian raw materials. There were also numerous complaints by British businessmen who were subject to duties levied on goods transshipped across the Ottoman Empire and arbitrary levies by local pashas. These duties were mainly confined to the realm of exports, while imports could be traded at ports for the traditional rate of 3%.|$|E

[...] - John Farrell. Who holds {{the balance of the}} world? Who reigns [...] . Jew Rothschild, and his fellow Christian, Baring. [...] - Lord Byron. [...] The objective of this work is to explain, elaborate and discuss the philosophical, political and economic ideas of the Single Tax movement in New South Wales in the 1880 s and 1890 s as enunciated through John Farrell and a group of intellectuals, Frank Cotton, Vincent Lesina, W. E. Johnson, E. W. Foxall, Peter McNaught and Percy Meggy. [...] During {{the early stages of the}} movement, and before the term 'Single Tax' was adopted, an incongruous mixture of freetraders, socialists, freethinkers and protectionists, regularly met as a Land Nationalisation League; and Henry George's Progress and Poverty (1879) was accepted as the basis of the organization. [...] Progress was steady and solid until the late 1880 s when, with the publicity generated by the proposed visit of Henry George, the movement began to demand serious and anxious notice from politicians of every grade and colour. And, recognizing in the taxation of land values a popular ticket for electioneering, political aspirants hurried to declare that they had always believed in a land tax. Yet a land tax was just what single taxers did not believe in; since a land tax is a tax on all land - an area or acreage tax - and single taxers believed a land tax would fall unjustly and produce the reverse of what they desired; i. e., the emancipation of the 'poor. ' [...] At that time, according to Timothy Coghlan the Government statistician, fewer than 700 persons owned about half of all the alienated land in New South Wales. The practice had been for big landowners to grab all the acres that they could; land then being the only form of property not subject to taxation, direct or indirect; and also the one form which increased in value proportionately with public activity and expenditure. [...] Implementation of the Single Tax, it was hoped, would force landowners, especially those who speculated in land, to employ labour so as to get the returns from which to pay the tax, or make them sell their land to those who wanted to use the land more productively. Either way it was suggested, wage-earners would benefit. [...] John Farrell, the poet, who was the leading advocate of land value taxation in New South Wales, is the main focus of this study, and his articles written for his own journals, or for the Daily Telegraph in Sydney where he served as editor and leader writer, provide almost all the Single Tax perspective. [...] Farrell saw his role chiefly as an educator, and consequently never sought parliamentary office. And, in contrast to the many that did go into parliament preaching the emancipation of labour, he did not believe emancipation lay in the multiplication of restrictions, but in the sweeping away of restrictions and the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>monopolies.</b> And the most important of all monopolies was that of the earth itself. Like all Georgists he argued that 'Free Land' meant 'free men,' and until they had the first the last was impossible. [...] In his various journals he never proposed that the struggles of party politics or the personal actions of party politicians should be noticed any more than was necessary; current affairs were dealt with as texts from which to preach economic truths. The special province of the Single Tax was to regard the prominent political occurrences and developments of each month from an ethical standpoint, and to indicate what was right and wrong in legislation. [...] The study begins with a look at the United States after the Civil War, when Henry George was a young man, and notices the growing discontent of wage-earners which was linked to the 'filching' of public lands by foreign land syndicates, and to the massive free grants to railway companies. The first section includes a short biographical sketch of George who wrote the only book on political economy that was read by millions; and a brief examination of conditions in Australia which, single taxers argued, fell a long way short of meeting expectations as a workers' paradise. This is followed by a short biography of John Farrell. In the second half we look at Single Tax attempts at reform; the great strikes; the first Single Tax conference; the visit by Henry George; the formation of the Labor Party, and the creation of labour settlements. [...] As a whole, this thesis is not a historical dissertation on the thoughts of Henry George or John Farrell. Rather it is more an exposition of the ideology of the Single Tax as it was shaped by the contributions and explanation of its leading adherents. The justification for the work is provided by the limited number of works on the subject; to lend legitimacy to a wage-earners' organization that was not a political party nor a trade union; and by the practice of some labour historians to minimise the efforts of the single taxers, and notice only those reformers who were affiliated with the Trades and Labour Council.

He was criticised for opposing the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> slavery without a financial compensation and for making representations to the British Government in London in 1831 and in 1833 on behalf of sugar planters who were slave owners. By so doing he negotiated a compensation for farmers, for the loss of their slaves, and who had to organise themselves to find replacement workers on the sugar estates. To the benefit of Mauritius he also secured the right of colonists to serve on the Legislative Council, the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>monopoly,</b> the establishing <b>of</b> a police force, the prosecution of abuse related to alcohol, and the lifting of censorship of the press. He also proposed a University in Mauritius where, among other subjects, Law would be taught. With his half-brother Prosper (1780-1856), he founded the newspaper “Le Cernéen” whose first number appeared on 14 February 1832. His construction of the first steam-driven sugar mill at Argy near Quatre Cocos, was of great benefit to the sugar industry. On 22 July 1832, a crowd of supporters invaded his residence, acclaimed the benefits which he had brought the country, requested that his daughter be adopted by the colony and that she be named Mauricia.|$|R

6000|$|Let {{me begin}} this paper upon the {{question}} of Scientific Administrative areas in relation to municipal undertakings by defining the sort of Socialism I profess. Because, you know, it is quite impossible to conceal that there are very many different sorts of socialism, and your society is, and has long been, a remarkably representative collection of the various types. We have this much in common, however, that we insist upon and hammer home and never {{lose sight of the}} fact that Property is a purely provisional and law-made thing, and that the law and the community which has given may also, at its necessity, take away. The work which the Socialist movement has done is to secure the general repudiation of any idea of sacredness about property. But upon the extent to which it is convenient to sanction a certain amount of property, and the ways in which existing excesses of property are to be reduced, Socialists differ enormously. There are certain extreme expressions of Socialism that you will connect with the names of Owen and Fourier, and with Noyes's [...] "History of American Socialism," [...] in which the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>monopoly</b> is carried out with logical completeness to the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> marriage, and in which the idea seems to be to extend the limits of the Family and of intimate intercourse to include all humanity. With these Socialisms I have nothing in common. There are a large number of such questions concerning the constitution of the family upon which I retain an open and inquiring mind, and to which I find the answers of the established order, if not always absolutely incorrect, at any rate glaringly incomplete and totally inadequate; but I do not find the answers of these Socialistic Communities in any degree more satisfactory.|$|R

40|$|Under the {{conditions}} of the socialist revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, the nationalization of land means the transfer of it as the object of ownership and the object of management to the government. In economic terms this meant the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> private ownership of land and its economic expression - absolute rent - and the transfer to the government of the right to appropriate differential rent, to dispose over the land, and to determine the principles of land relations. The character of land relations changed radically. The latter no longer form between private owners, landowners, capitalist lessees, and hired workers but between the government as the owner of the land and socialist production collectives (collective and state farms) that receive land from the government for their exclusive use for farming. Socialist land relations are the relations between the government and production collectives with respect {{to the use of the}} land, which is the basic means of production of agricultural collectives but which is also public, government property. ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1849 former {{court clerk}} and {{university}} dropout Alexander Ostrovsky wrote It's a Family Affair, {{a play that}} was banned by state censorship. Ostrovsky continued writing, and in 1853 Maly produced two of his plays: The Morning of a Young Man and Don't Sit in a Sledge You Don't Own. For the next thirty years, Maly produced one or two new plays by Ostrovsky each year. Ostrovsky's modern drama became a trademark for the theatre; previously known as House of Shchepkin, Maly became House of Ostrovsky. Plays by Ostrovsky appeared difficult to old-school actors like Schepkin, but helped in establishing {{a new generation of}} Maly actors. Prov Sadovsky, promoted by Shchepkin, became the [...] "primary interpreter of Ostrovsky". Ostrovsky lived in poverty due to hostility of the Imperial Theatre Board, and ironically, he was appointed director of Moscow Theatre Board shortly before his death, becoming the head of Maly. Public activities by Ostrovsky contributed to the establishment of national playwright's union (1865) and <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> state <b>monopoly</b> on theatre (1882). As a manager, Ostrovsky formed lasting relationships with the cast, campaigned for professional stage training, and even conducted statistical surveys of the audience.|$|R
50|$|The lack of {{provision}} of public goods is attributed {{in turn to}} the lack of revenues and the inefficient and racially biased fiscal system. Sancianco called for the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the tobacco <b>monopoly,</b> the racially discriminatory tribute system, and all customs duties. Instead he proposed a reform of the system of internal taxes that involved the introduction of a small poll tax (cedula) applicable to all regardless of race, and a presumptive tax on urban and rural property, {{as well as on the}} practice of the professions. Sancianco was aware that a tax based on “net income” was a first-best solution, but his proposals were made taking full account of the pragmatic difficulty of accurately determining and assessing net incomes when taxpayers were prone to evasion and tax officials corruptible. Hence he proposed taxes based on observable characteristics, i.e., presumptive taxes.|$|R
50|$|His {{favorite}} {{field of}} labor was thrown open to him when, on 6 August 1784, {{he was appointed}} head of the Rentekammeret, or Exchequer. His {{first step was to}} appoint a small commission to improve the condition of the crown serfs, and among other things enable them to turn their leaseholds into freeholds. Noting that Frederick VI was sympathetic towards the improvement of conditions for the peasantry, Reventlow persuaded him, in July 1786, to appoint a commission to examine the condition of all the peasantry in the kingdom. This celebrated agricultural commission continued its work for many years, and introduced a series of major reforms. For example, an ordinance of 8 June 1787 modified the existing leaseholds greatly to the benefit of the peasantry; another on 20 June 1788 abolished villenage and completely transformed the much-abused hoveri system whereby the feudal tenant was required to cultivate his lord's land as well as his own; and an ordinance of 6 December 1799 abolished the hoveri system altogether. Reventlow was also instrumental in founding the public credit banks, which enabled small cultivators to borrow money on favorable terms. In conjunction with his friend, Heinrich Ernst Schimmelmann (1747-1831), he was also instrumental in the passing of ordinances permitting free trade between Denmark and Norway, the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> import duty for corn, and the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the mischievous <b>monopoly</b> <b>of</b> the Iceland trade.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to prove that the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> state <b>monopoly</b> in the {{provision}} of educational services in Continental Europe will result in members of the educational community spending less time towards rent protection and more time towards educational activities, something that should also benefit the consumers of these services. It also aims to prove that once deregulation reform is introduced, those that now fiercely resist to it will, rationally, accept the new status quo and adapt to it. Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents a model in which externalities affect the decision of the community of educational services providers to allocate time among their profession and towards opposing reform and protecting rents that follow from laws that establish state monopolies in the market for education services. The model proposed shows that, in the presence of such externalities, the introduction of reforms that remove the state monopoly will make the educational community adapt to the new status quo by allocating less time to protect monopoly rents and oppose reform, and more time and effort towards educational-related activities like research and publications, high-quality teaching and tutorials, etc. Findings – The prediction of the assumed model that no internal forces can lead to a departure from the unfavorable equilibrium that exists before reform, underlines the need of society to press ahead with reforms regardless of the objections raised by the affected interest communities. Originality/value – The paper provides for the first time in the relevant literature, an analysis of the harms and drawbacks of the higher education state monopoly in Continental Western Europe.

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{the conclusions of}} a study on entrepreneurial activities related to the cycle of the olive-oil economy in Lesvos, {{an island in the}} North-Eastern Aegean, from the eighteenth century until the middle of the twentieth century. It is based on research and observations drawn from a multiform primary material, such as companies' records, communal and family archives, consular and administrative reports, as well as secondary sources which allow comparisons with other oleiferous regions and connect the economy of Lesvos to the broader Aegean and Mediterranean environment. It points out that the single cultivation phenomenon, though associated to the economy of risk, obeyed to the market's command and was prepared by the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the governor's <b>monopoly</b> on the oil trading and the consequent opening of the market. This enabled the Christian ottoman subjects to develop the administration of intensive olive growing, mechanized oil extraction and trade expansion. Olive oil and soap were the two basic commodities of the island's export revenues that were commercialised, despite their low quality, into a wide range of port and island markets of the Asia Minor coast, the Aegean islands and the Black Sea. Moreover, the article explores the type of commercial and industrial enterprises and the characteristics of the olive-cycle entrepreneurs. It concludes with the commercial crisis suffered from the major political and economic changes of the twentieth century and the consequent reorientation of Lesvos' businessmen towards Crete and Piraeus, the olive manufacturing centres of the Neohellenic state...|$|R
