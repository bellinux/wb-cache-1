5|$|By late 1989, the Communist Parties of {{the republics}} of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had largely been {{weakened}} in power. In Nagorno-Karabakh, the intercommunal relations between Armenians and Azerbaijanis had worsened due to violence and pogroms. Gorbachev's policies hastened {{the collapse of the}} Soviet system and many Armenians and Azerbaijanis sought protection by <b>arming</b> themselves with Soviet military weaponry. His preoccupation in dealing with the numerous demands by the other republics saw the disappearance of vast amounts of assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and other small arms munitions stored in caches throughout Armenia and Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>arming</b> of the Italian ironclads Duilio and Dandolo with 100-ton guns, the British feared an Italian {{attack on}} Malta, as the ships could fire on Malta's batteries, {{destroying}} them {{one after the}} other, while keeping outside their guns' range. To prevent this, the British requested that four 100-ton guns be built. Two of these were installed in Malta, and Cambridge Battery and Rinella Battery were built specifically to house these guns. Construction of the batteries began in 1878 and they were complete by 1886. The gun at Rinella still exists.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the Log Revolution and the end of April 1991, nearly 200 incidents involving the use of explosive devices and 89 attacks on the Croatian police were recorded. The Croatian Ministry of the Interior started <b>arming</b> an increasing number of special police forces, and this led to the building of a real army. On 9 April 1991, Croatian President Tuđman ordered the special police forces to be renamed Zbor Narodne Garde ("National Guard"); this marks the creation of a separate military of Croatia.|$|E

However, Kolchak's Czech troops were returning home, and the British military contingent was urgently trying to replace them with Russians.

5|$|Shinano was {{designed}} to load and fuel her aircraft on deck where it was safer for the ship; experiences in the Battles of Midway and the Coral Sea had demonstrated that the existing doctrine of fueling and <b>arming</b> their aircraft below decks was a real danger to the carriers if they were attacked while doing so. Much of Shinanos hangar was left open for better ventilation, although steel shutters could close off most of the hangar sides if necessary. This also allowed ordnance or burning aircraft to be jettisoned into the sea, something that the earlier carriers could not do with their enclosed hangars.|$|E
