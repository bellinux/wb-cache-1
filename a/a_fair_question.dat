[...] Humphries followed up, asking whether she thinks Obama's birth certificate is <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>question</b> to be looking at.

This would leave human authors to focus on generating deep questions.

I could not have told him that Nina had said: [...] "It has set at last." [...] He would have been extremely surprised and perhaps have dropped his precious banjo. Neither could I have told him that the sun of my sea-going was setting too, even as I wrote the words expressing the impatience of passionate youth bent on its desire.

40|$|THESIS 5287 This {{thesis is}} a {{critical}} evaluation of criminal procedure and mental health in Ireland, concentrating in particular on fitness to plead, insanity acquittals, transfers from ordinary mental hospitals to the Central Mental Hospital and transfers from prisons to mental hospitals. Throughout the thesis, constitutional and human rights considerations are emphasised. A broadening of the existing definition of fitness to plead is suggested, to cover defendants? analytic capacity {{as well as their}} cognitive abilities. A ?trial of the facts? procedure is proposed to ensure that the strength of the prosecution?s case is tested before it is possible to detain a person. However, proposals to allow postponement of the issue of fitness until the prosecution case has ended would conflict with the right to <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> trial. The <b>question</b> of fitness to plead in the District Court needs to be clarified in legislation...|$|R

GameZone commented [...] "Scene It? features plenty of movie trivia factoids to keep cinemaphiles happy, but a dearth of features (no online play?!?) {{and the availability of}} other, better trivia games for PlayStation 3 makes me doubt that this was ever intended for the big screen to begin with". In contrast, Game Revolution cited [...] "Scene It? can only be entertaining — not to mention, fair — if everyone playing not only has comparable movie knowledge but also comparable gaming experience, which is completely ridiculous for a casual party game. And the thing that's so irritating about it all is that these problems could have been fixed with almost zero effort".|$|R

The artistic temperament, too, is soft and sensitive; so there are all these reasons for thinking that perhaps he would have been for keeping {{out of the way of}} the heat and dust of modern progress.

60|$|I. I say, first, Love {{for the art}} {{which you}} practise. Be assured that if ever any other motive becomes a leading one in your mind, as the {{principal}} one for exertion, except your love of art, that moment it is all over with your art. I do not say you are to desire money, nor to desire fame, nor to desire position; you cannot but desire all three; nay, you may--if you are willing that I should use the word Love in a desecrated sense--love all three; that is, passionately covet them, yet you must not covet or love {{them in the first}} place. Men of strong passions and imaginations must always care a great deal for anything they care for at all; but the whole question is one of first or second. Does your art lead you, or your gain lead you? You may like making money exceedingly; but if it come to <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>question,</b> whether you are to make five hundred pounds less by this business, or to spoil your building, and you choose to spoil your building, there's an end of you. So you may be as thirsty for fame as a cricket is for cream; but, if it come to <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>question,</b> whether you are to please the mob, or do the thing as you know it ought to be done; and you can't do both, and choose to please the mob, it's all over with you--there's no hope for you; nothing that you can do will ever be worth a man's glance as he passes by. The test is absolute, inevitable--Is your art first with you? Then you are artists; you may be, after you have made your money, misers and usurers; you may be, after you have got your fame, jealous, and proud, and wretched, and base: but yet, as long as you won't spoil your work, you are artists. On the other hand--Is your money first with you, and your fame first with you? Then, you may be very charitable with your money, and very magnificent with your money, and very graceful in the way you wear your reputation, and very courteous to those beneath you, and very acceptable to those above you; but you are not artists.
