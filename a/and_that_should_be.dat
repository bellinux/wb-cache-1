5|$|That night, Jack tells {{everyone}} that he trusts Juliet <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> enough, but Sayid disagrees. Jack continues {{to explain that}} John Locke blew up the submarine that was to take him home. Claire suddenly collapses with blood gushing from her face. Juliet takes Jack and Kate aside and tells them she knows what's wrong with Claire because she did it to her. At the camp, Juliet explains that Claire's immune system has turned against her due to a latent reaction to medication in her bloodstream. The medication was designed by Juliet to keep Claire alive during her pregnancy. She {{was brought to the}} island to find out why women couldn't have children. The mother's body treats the pregnancy as a foreign invader and the immune system attacks; every pregnant woman on the island has died. Claire was the first to survive even though she showed some of the symptoms.|$|E

2500|$|Eliades Acosta, a {{prominent}} Cuban historian, {{head of the}} Cuban Communist Party's Committee on Culture and {{former director of the}} Jose Marti National Library in Havana, offered the standard Cuban interpretation of the sinking of the Maine (that the United States itself probably did it) in an interview to The New York Times. But Acosta adds that [...] "Americans died for the freedom of Cuba, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> recognized. But others wanted to annex Cuba, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> criticized. If relations with the United States improve, all these things can be re-examined more fairly". This claim has also been made in Russia. Mikhail Khazin, a Russian economist who once ran the cultural section at Komsomolskaya Pravda, speaking in a 2008 Pravda interview of the need in troubled times to change the psychology of society, to unite it, said that [...] "the Americans blew up their own battleship Maine." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{former prime}} {{minister}} Sir John Major suggested in November 2013 that Scotland would need to re-apply for EU membership, but that this would mean overcoming opposition to separatists among many existing member states, particularly Spain. It may block Scottish membership of the EU, amid fears of repercussions with separatist movements in Catalonia and the Basque Country: in November 2013 the Spanish Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, said: [...] "I {{know for sure that}} a region that would separate from a member state of the European Union would remain outside the European Union <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> known by the Scots {{and the rest of the}} European citizens." [...] He also stated that an independent Scotland would become a [...] "third country" [...] outside the EU and would require the consent of all 28 EU states to rejoin the EU, but that he would not seek to block an independent Scotland's entry. Salmond cited a letter from Mario Tenreiro of the EC's secretariat general that said it would be legally possible to renegotiate the situation of the UK and Scotland within the EU by unanimous agreement of all member states. Spain's position was reiterated two days before the referendum by the Spanish European affairs minister, who said [...] "It is crystal clear that any partner member-state that leaves the member state is out of the European Union. If they want to apply again, they would have to follow the procedure of article 49 of the treaties." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law Center, {{said that}} the Supreme Court has never ruled that {{companies}} have religious beliefs and that [...] "it has never held that religious exercise provides a license to harm others, or violate the rights of third parties." [...] Louise Melling, ACLU deputy legal director, said religious freedom [...] "gives us all the right to hold our beliefs, but it doesn't give {{you the right to}} impose your beliefs on others, to discriminate against others." [...] The editorial board of The New York Times wrote that the decision [...] "swept aside accepted principles of corporate law and religious liberty to grant owners of closely held, for-profit companies an unprecedented right to impose their religious views on employees." [...] A Fox News columnist wrote, [...] "..., with all of the debate about the religious beliefs of the Hobby Lobby owners, what about the religious beliefs of their employees? They are just as important, and should not be trampled upon." [...] The director of the United Church of Christ's Washington, D.C. office, {{said that the}} ruling [...] "may embolden private employers to claim religious objections to particular health care services, in effect forcing their own religious views upon their employees." [...] Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, [...] "It's the first time that our court has said that a closely held corporation has the rights of a person when it comes to religious freedom, which means that the ... corporation's employers can impose their religious beliefs on their employees." [...] The Center for American Progress said that the ruling [...] "moves in the direction this court has been moving already, which is talking about corporate personhood—really treating corporations like people, saying that the corporation has a religion itself <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> imposed on its employees." [...] Interfaith Alliance leader Rev. Welton Gaddy said, [...] "The First Amendment is at its best when it is used {{to protect the rights of}} minorities from the whims of the powerful. Today's decision, which gives the powerful the right to force their religious beliefs on those around them, is a far cry from the best traditions of religious freedom." ...|$|E
