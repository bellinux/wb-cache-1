500|$|The Fame {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 71, based on 13 reviews. Matthew Chisling from Allmusic called the album [...] "a well-crafted sampling of feisty anti-pop in high quality", and wrote that it [...] "fails {{to come up}} short on funky sounds to amuse fans of this dance genre." [...] Nicole Powers of URB complimented its [...] "irony-laden lyrics, delivered in a style that owes <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> Gwen Stefani," [...] {{as well as the}} album's [...] "deluxe ditties". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "remarkably (and exhaustingly) pure in its vision of a world in which nothing trumps being beautiful, dirty, and rich. In this economy, though, her high-times escapism has its charms". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian found it [...] "packing an immensely addictive melody or an inescapable hook, virtually everything sounds like another hit single", and predicted that it [...] "certainly sounds like it could be big." [...] Daniel Brockman from The Phoenix wrote that [...] "Gaga ups the ante in terms of catchy songwriting and sheer high-in-the-club-banging-to-the-beat abandon." [...] Ben Hogwood of musicOMH praised Gaga's [...] "blend of sassy attitude, metallic beats and sharp, incisive songwriting", elements which he felt are integral to [...] "creating pop music".|$|E
2500|$|According to Peter Guralnick, for Elvis and {{the guys}} [...] "Hollywood was just an open {{invitation}} to party all night long. Sometimes they would hang out with Sammy Davis, Jr., or check out Bobby Darin at the Cloister. Nick Adams and his gang came by the suite all the time, {{not to mention the}} eccentric actor Billy Murphy ..." [...] When Buzz Cason asked Lamar Fike [...] "how Elvis did it – this partying nearly every night," [...] he [...] "answered, 'A little somethin' to get down and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> get up.' Obviously, {{he was referring to the}} pills that started a trend that sadly in only a few years would lead to Elvis's untimely death." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 30, 2008, {{the first}} teaser trailer {{for the film}} was {{released}} on Smith's website, silentbobspeaks.com. The teaser depicts Rogen and Banks' characters as they hold auditions. In his online diary, Kevin Smith insisted it was strictly a teaser, mentioning, [...] "There ain't a frame of footage in this puppy that's in the actual flick, so feel free to watch it without fear of 'spoilers'. This is just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> give you {{a bit of a}} feel for the flick." [...] On July 21, however, the video was removed from the website following an order by the MPAA because it was designated a [...] "teaser trailer" [...] without passing through MPAA certification. On September 2, 2008, a red band trailer of the film was released at IGN.|$|E

60|$|Then {{they had}} the grandest wedding that ever was seen {{in all of the}} world. Everybody was asked, and there was enough for all to eat as much as they chose, and <b>to</b> take <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> home <b>to</b> the {{children}} beside. If I had been there I would have brought you something.|$|R

2500|$|Gilmore Girls non-diegetic {{score was}} {{composed}} by singer-songwriter Sam Phillips throughout its entire run. Sherman-Palladino, {{who served as}} the music supervisor of the series, was a big fan of the musician and secured her involvement. For the score's instrumental arrangement, Phillips primarily used her voice and an acoustic guitar, and on occasion included piano, violin, and drums. Many of the musical cues are accompanied by melodic [...] "la-la"s and [...] "ahh"s, which [...] developed because Sherman-Palladino wanted the score to sound connected to the girls themselves, almost like [...] "an extension of their thoughts ... if they had music going in their head during a certain emotional thing in their life." [...] Sherman-Palladino felt that the score elevated the series [...] "because it wasn't a wasted element in the show. Everything was trying to say a little something, add <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> it." [...] Several of Phillips' album tracks are also played in the show, and she made an appearance in the season six finale, performing part of [...] "Taking Pictures".|$|E

According to Missy, “My mother taught me, I don’t {{have to wait until}} I have millions to start helping people, she told me it’s not how much I give but it’s the love that I put into what I give that matters and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> given <b>to</b> someone could {{make a big difference in}} their lives.” ...|$|R

He likes me, becuz I don't ever act as if I was above him. Sometime I've set right down and eat WITH him. But you needn't tell that.

60|$|The ninety dollars which I {{gained from}} {{this series of}} lectures was, let me say, the less {{important}} part of my victory, {{and yet it was}} wondrous opportune. They enabled me to cancel my indebtedness to the Doctor, and still have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> keep me going until my classes began in October, and as my landlord did not actually evict me, I stayed on shamelessly, fattening visibly on the puddings and roasts which Mrs. Cross provided and dear old Mary cooked with joy. She was the true artist. She loved to see her work appreciated.|$|E
60|$|Hemmings swayed, recovered, {{and with}} a forced smile replied that, if this were true, he had been {{standing}} on his head for years; {{he did not believe}} the attitude possible for such a length of time; personally he would have thought that he too had had <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to the company's position, but no matter...! His irony was crushing.... It was possible that Mr. Pippin hoped to reverse the existing laws of the universe with regard to limited companies; he would merely say that he must not begin with a company of which he (Hemmings) happened to be secretary. Mr. Scorrier had hinted at excuses; for his part, with the best intentions in the world, he had great difficulty in seeing them. He would go further--he did not see them! The explosion...! Pippin shrank so visibly that Hemmings seemed troubled by a suspicion that he had gone too far.|$|E
6000|$|The truth is, when Major Dobbin came {{on board}} the Ramchumder, very sick, and for the three days she lay in the Madras Roads, he did not begin to rally, nor did even the {{appearance}} and recognition of his old acquaintance, Mr. Sedley, on board much cheer him, until after a conversation which they had one day, as the Major was laid languidly on the deck. He said then {{he thought he was}} doomed; he had left <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> his godson in his will, and he trusted Mrs. Osborne would remember him kindly and be happy in the marriage she was about to make. [...] "Married? not the least," [...] Jos answered; [...] "he had heard from her: she made no mention of the marriage, and by the way, it was curious, she wrote to say that Major Dobbin was going to be married, and hoped that HE would be happy." [...] What were the dates of Sedley's letters from Europe? The civilian fetched them. They were two months later than the Major's; and the ship's surgeon congratulated himself upon the treatment adopted by him towards his new patient, who had been consigned to shipboard by the Madras practitioner with very small hopes indeed; for, from that day, the very day that he changed the draught, Major Dobbin began to mend. And thus it was that deserving officer, Captain Kirk, was disappointed of his majority.|$|E
6000|$|In the evening, the {{excellent}} Frenchman {{made an effort}} to cheer the two dull young people. He came in confidentially with his fiddle, and said he had a favour to ask. [...] "I possess some knowledge, sir, of the delightful art of dancing. Might I teach young Miss to dance? You see, if I may venture to say so, the other lessons--oh, most useful, most important, the other lessons! but they are just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> serious. <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> relieve her mind, sir--if you will forgive me for mentioning it.

5000|$|Reception for {{the game}} has been polarized, with the Xbox version {{receiving}} the best reviews, the PS2 version mediocre, and the GameCube version receiving the worst. In 2009, GamesRadar included it among the games [...] "with untapped franchise potential", commenting: [...] "Though reviews were fairly mixed, Rogue Ops was surprisingly good, and even managed to add <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> the Splinter Cell and Metal Gear dominated stealth genre." ...|$|E

6000|$|Winston, {{glancing at}} the man's face, {{considered}} this very probable, and went out.

60|$|They {{carried him}} upstairs, and crushed the {{youngest}} gentleman at every step. His bedroom {{was at the}} top of the house, and it was a long way; but they got him there in course of time. He asked them frequently on the road for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> drop of <b>something</b> <b>to</b> drink. It seemed an idiosyncrasy. The youngest gentleman in company proposed a draught of water. Mr Pecksniff called him opprobious names for the suggestion.|$|R

50|$|In the 1990s, {{instead of}} being marketed as people who lived better and were better than average, idols became people who just {{happened}} to have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> become popular.

5000|$|In {{a review}} from Entertainment Weekly, Hillary Busis quotes, [...] "Uh oh, dearies - we've reached the part in our story when {{everyone}} is being afflicted by crippling self-doubt. (Or, in Emma's case, {{the part where}} she... continues to be afflicted by crippling self-doubt.) It's a necessary step along any hero's journey. Unfortunately, it's not exactly the most scintillating subject in Once's repertoire. At least Rumbelle supporters and Captain Swan crew members each got <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> snack on; {{the rest of us}} will just have to hope things get more exciting when Tinkerbell flits into our lives next week." ...|$|E
5000|$|On July 31, 2012, Sly {{died in his}} sleep, at age 41. [...] There is no {{confirmed}} {{cause of}} death, though various artists indicated pills, alcohol, pain and depression may have had an effect. In an interview less than 2 months before he passed he indicated as much: [...] "have a herniated disc on my cervical spine. I'm in pain {{all the time and}} that sucks. I've been getting epidural shots, seeing a chiropractor and I'm in physical therapy. It's all a bit much, and a bit depressing. ...

My father and I labored {{for a long time}} to root out {{drinking}} from our village at Spindlewood. It seemed, for the time, as if it would be the destruction of every thing there. The fact was, there was rum in every family; the parents took it daily, the children learned to love and long after it, by seeing the parents, and drinking little sweetened remains at the bottoms of tumblers. There were, every year, families broken up and destroyed, and fine fellows going to the very devil, with this thing; and so we made a movement to form a temperance society. I paid lecturers, and finally lectured myself. At last they said to me: 'It's all very well for you rich people, that have twice as fine houses and twice as many pleasures as we poor folks, to pick on us for having <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> comfortable <b>to</b> drink in our houses. If we could afford your fine nice wines, and all that, we wouldn't drink whiskey. You must all have your wine on the table; whiskey is the poor man's wine.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Nevertheless, to a {{young girl}} like Fan, living alone, and {{beautiful}} to the eye, {{the large amount of}} immorality around her was a serious trouble, and she never ventured out in the evening, even to go a short distance, without trepidation and a fast-beating heart, so strong was that old loathing and horror the leering looks and insolent advances of dissolute men inspired in her. And in no part of London are such men more numerous. When the shadows of evening fall their thoughts [...] "lightly turn" [...] to the tired shop-girl, just released from her long hours of standing and serving, and the surveillance perhaps of a tyrannical shop-walker who makes her life a burden. Her cheap black dress, pale face, and wistful eyes betray her. She is so tired, so hungry for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> recreation, <b>something</b> <b>to</b> give <b>a</b> <b>little</b> brightness and colour to her grey life, so unprotected and weak to resist--how easy to compass her destruction! The long evenings were lonely in her room, but it was safe there, and sitting before her fire writing to Constance, or thinking of her, and reading again one of the small collection of books she had brought from Eyethorne, the hours would pass not too slowly.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from film critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film 32% from 31 reviews. Marsha McCreadie from RogerEbert.com wrote: [...] "A Teacher {{will leave you}} feeling drained, even exhausted. That's about right for a movie about obsession, one with no resolution except waiting for the other thud to drop... Much of the movie takes place in dark interiors. The love-making scenes are steamy, seemingly passionate; risqué not pornographic. Happily, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> is left <b>to</b> the imagination. Though after awhile you're itchy {{to get out of}} the bedroom, or the old high school staple, the car. The [...] "one-room" [...] claustrophobia is reminiscent of being trapped in the love-nest of Last Tango in Paris... To her great credit, director Fidell - named by Filmmaker Magazine as one of the 25 New Faces of Independent Film - takes on a tricky topic. She even gets us to empathize with the person in the power spot." ...|$|R
