50|$|<b>Avitriptan</b> (INN) (code name BMS-180,048) is an {{antimigraine}} drug of the triptan family {{which was}} never marketed. It {{acts as a}} 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor agonist.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Several acutely acting {{antimigraine}} drugs, including ergotamine and sumatriptan, {{have the}} ability to constrict porcine arteriovenous anastomoses as well as the human isolated coronary artery. These two experimental models seem to serve as indicators, respectively, for the therapeutic and coronary side-effect potential of the compounds. Using these two models, we have now investigated the effects of <b>avitriptan</b> (BMS- 180048; 3 -[3 -[4 -(5 -methoxy- 4 -pyrimidinyl) - 1 -piperazinyl]propyl]-N-methyl- 1 H-indole- 5 -methanesulfonamide monofumarate), a new 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor agonist. In anaesthetized pigs, <b>avitriptan</b> (10, 30, 100 and 300 [*]μg·kg– 1) decreased the total carotid blood flow by exclusively decreasing arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow; capillary blood flow was increased.

40|$|<b>Avitriptan</b> {{is a new}} 5 -HT 1 -like agonist with {{abortive}} antimigraine properties. The {{study was}} conducted to characterize the pharma-cokinetics, absolute bioavailability, and disposition of <b>avitriptan</b> after intravenous (iv) and oral administrations of [14 C]avitriptan in rats and oral administration of [14 C]avitriptan in humans. The doses used were 20 mg/kg iv and oral in the rat, 10 mg iv in humans, and 50 mg oral in humans. The drug was rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations occur-ring at 0. 5 hr postdose. Absolute bioavailability was 19. 3 % in rats and 17. 2 % in humans. Renal excretion was a minor route of elim-ination in both species, with the majority of the dose being ex-creted in the feces. After a single oral dose, urinary excretion accounted for 10 % of the administered dose in rats and 18 % of the administered dose in humans, with the remainder excreted in the feces. Extensive biliary excretion was observed in rats. Avitripta...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{antimigraine}} drugs ergotamine and sumatriptan {{may cause}} angina-like symptoms, possibly resulting from coronary artery constriction. We compared the coronary vasoconstrictor {{potential of a}} number of current and prospective antimigraine drugs (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, methysergide and its metabolite methylergometrine, sumatriptan, naratriptan, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, <b>avitriptan).</b> METHODS AND RESULTS: Concentration-response curves to the antimigraine drugs were constructed in human isolated coronary artery segments to obtain the maximum contractile response (Emax) and the concentration eliciting 50 % of Emax (EC 50). The EC 50 values were related to maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reported in patients, obtaining Cmax/EC 50 ratios as an index of coronary vasoconstriction occurring in the clinical setting. Furthermore, we studied the duration of contractile responses after washout of the acutely acting antimigraine drugs to assess their disappearance from the receptor biophase. Compared with sumatriptan, all drugs were more potent (lower EC 50 values) in contracting the coronary artery but had similar efficacies (Emax < 25 % of K+-induced contraction). The Cmax of <b>avitriptan</b> was 7 - to 11 -fold higher than its EC 50 value, whereas those of the other drugs were < 40 % of their respective EC 50 values. The contractile responses to ergotamine and dihydroergotamine persisted even after repeated washings, but those to the other drugs declined rapidly after washing. CONCLUSIONS: All current and prospective antimigraine drugs contract the human coronary artery in vitro, but in view of low efficacy, these drugs are unlikely to cause myocardial ischemia at therapeutic plasma concentrations in healthy subjects. In patients with coronary artery disease, however, these drugs must remain contraindicated. The sustained contraction by ergotamine and dihydroergotamine seems to be an important disadvantage compared with sumatriptan-like drugs...|$|E
40|$|In 1996, our {{knowledge}} of acute antimigraine therapy expanded in three major areas. First, large surveys have confirmed the remarkable efficacy profile of sumatriptan in clinical practice. No satisfying clinical, pharmacokinetic or genetic explanations were found for its major shortcomings: nonresponders, headache recurrence and noncardiac chest symptoms. Second, the novel 5 -HT 1 B/D agonists zolmitriptan (311 C 90), rizatriptan (MK- 462), eletriptan (UK- 116, 044), <b>avitriptan</b> (BMS- 180048) and alniditan (R 091274) were all proved superior to placebo for attack treatment, but their advantages over sumatriptan are yet to be analysed in more detail. A higher lipophilicity explains (except for alniditan) their greater oral bioavailability and better central nervous system penetration. A central action now proved experimentally in animals and in humans for 5 -HT 1 B/D agonists such as zolmitriptan may be advantageous for the antimigraine efficacy, {{but it could also}} increase sedation. Third, an endothelin (Ro 470203, bosentan) and a neurokinin 1 (RPR 100893) receptor antagonist were found to be ineffective in migraine. Both compounds are potent inhibitors of neurogenic plasma extravasation in rat dura mater, which might suggest that this pharmacological property does not necessarily predict efficacy in aborting migraine attacks.

40|$|The {{cerebrovascular}} receptor(s) that mediates 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) -induced vasoconstriction {{in human}} cerebral arteries (HCA) has proven difficult to characterize, yet these are essential in migraine. We have examined 5 -HT receptor subtype distribution in cerebral blood vessels by immunocytochemistry with antibodies selective for human 5 -HT 1 B and human 5 -HT 1 D receptors and also studied the contractile {{effects of a}} range of 5 -HT receptor agonists and antagonists in HCA. Immunocytochemistry of cerebral arteries showed dense 5 -HT 1 B receptor immunoreactivity (but no 5 -HT 1 D receptor immunoreactivity) within the smooth muscle wall of the HCA. The endothelial cell layer was well preserved and weak 5 -HT 1 B receptor immunoreactivity was present. Pharmacological experiments on HCA with intact endothelium showed that 5 -carboxamidotryptamine was significantly more potent than α-methyl- 5 -HT, 2 -methyl- 5 -HT and 5 -HT in causing vasoconstriction. The 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor agonists naratriptan, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan and 181 C 91 (N-desmethyl zolmitriptan), all induced equally strong contractions and with similar potency as 5 -HT. The maximum contractile response was significantly less for <b>avitriptan</b> and dihydroergotamine. There was a significant correlation between vasoconstrictor potency and 5 -HT 1 B- and 5 -HT 1 D-receptor affinity, but not with 5 -HT 1 A-, 5 -ht 1 F or 5 -HT 2 - receptor affinity. The 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D-receptor antagonist GR 55562 (10 − 7 – 10 − 6 [*]M) inhibited the contractile responses to sumatriptan and 5 -CT in a competitive manner with a pKB value for GR 55562 of 7. 4. Furthermore, ketanserin (10 − 7 [*]M), prazosin (10 − 7 [*]M), and sulpiride (10 − 7 [*]M) were devoid of significant antagonistic activity of 5 -HT-induced contraction in the HCA. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that the 5 -HT 1 B receptors {{play a major role in}} 5 -HT-induced vasoconstriction in HCA...|$|E
