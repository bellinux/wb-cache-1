25|$|Habit {{formation}} {{is the process}} by which a behavior, through regular repetition, becomes automatic or habitual. This is modelled as an increase in automaticity with number of repetitions up to an <b>asymptote.</b> This process of habit formation can be slow. Lally et al. (2010) found the average time for participants to reach the <b>asymptote</b> of automaticity was 66 days with a range of 18–254 days.|$|E

25|$|A non {{constant}} {{polynomial function}} tends to infinity when the variable increases indefinitely (in absolute value).

25|$|Lapicque's {{hyperbolic}} formula {{combines the}} threshold amplitude of a stimulus with its duration. This represents the first manageable with physiologically defined parameters that could compare excitability of different objects, reflecting {{an urgent need}} {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. Lapicque used constant-current, capacitor-discharge pulses to obtain chronaxie for a wide variety of excitable tissues. Rheobase in the Lapicque equation is the <b>asymptote</b> of the hyperbolic curve at very long durations.|$|E
25|$|Every {{infinite}} {{branch of}} an algebraic curve {{corresponds to a}} point at infinity on the curve, that {{is a point of}} the projective completion of the curve that does not belongs to its affine part. The corresponding <b>asymptote</b> is the tangent of the curve at that point. The general formula for a tangent to a projective curve may apply, but it is worth to make it explicit in this case.|$|E
25|$|A {{system with}} an {{intermediate}} quality factor (Qnbsp&=nbsp&) {{is said to}} be critically damped. Like an overdamped system, the output does not oscillate, and does not overshoot its steady-state output (i.e., it approaches a steady-state <b>asymptote).</b> Like an underdamped response, the output of such a system responds quickly to a unit step input. Critical damping results in the fastest response (approach to the final value) possible without overshoot. Real system specifications usually allow some overshoot for a faster initial response or require a slower initial response to provide a safety margin against overshoot.|$|E
50|$|There are {{potentially}} {{three kinds of}} asymptotes: horizontal, vertical and oblique <b>asymptotes.</b> For curves given by the graph of a function y = &fnof;(x), horizontal <b>asymptotes</b> are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as x tends to +&infin; or &minus;&infin;. Vertical <b>asymptotes</b> are vertical lines near which the function grows without bound.|$|R
50|$|The <b>asymptotes</b> of an {{algebraic}} {{curve in}} the affine plane are the lines that are tangent to the projectivized curve through a point at infinity. For example, one may identify the <b>asymptotes</b> to the unit hyperbola in this manner. <b>Asymptotes</b> are often considered only for real curves, although they also make sense when defined in this way for curves over an arbitrary field.|$|R
5000|$|Because a skew {{reflection}} {{leaves the}} hyperbola fixed, {{the pair of}} <b>asymptotes</b> is fixed, too. Hence the midpoint [...] of a chord [...] divides the related line segment [...] between the <b>asymptotes</b> into halves, too. This means that [...] This property {{can be used for}} the construction of further points [...] of the hyperbola if a point [...] and the <b>asymptotes</b> are given.|$|R
25|$|A {{system with}} low quality factor (Q<nbsp&) {{is said to}} be overdamped. Such a system doesn't {{oscillate}} at all, but when displaced from its equilibrium steady-state output it returns to it by exponential decay, approaching the steady state value asymptotically. It has an impulse response that is the sum of two decaying exponential functions with different rates of decay. As the quality factor decreases the slower decay mode becomes stronger relative to the faster mode and dominates the system's response resulting in a slower system. A second-order low-pass filter with a very low quality factor has a nearly first-order step response; the system's output responds to a step input by slowly rising toward an <b>asymptote.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{equation}} {{suggests that}} a graph of threshold stimulus strength versus stimulus duration should show a decay toward zero as stimulus duration is increased, so the stimulus strength required to reach threshold is predicted to increase during more protracted stimulation. The strength-duration curve for a typical nerve membrane is slightly skewed from the predicted graph, in that the curve flattens out in response to repetitive stimulation reaching an <b>asymptote</b> representing rheobase. When the duration of a stimulus is prolonged, charge transfer and membrane potential rise exponentially to a plateau (instead of increasing linearly with time). When rheobase exceeds {{the strength of the}} stimulus, stimulation fails to generate action potentials (even with large values of t); thus if the stimulus is too small, the membrane potential never reaches threshold. The disparity between the shape of the strength-duration curve predicted by Weiss's equation and the one actually observed in neural membranes can be attributed to leakage of charge that occurs under physiological conditions, a feature of the electrical resistance of the membrane. Weiss' equation predicts the relationship between stimulus strength and duration for an ideal capacitor with no leakage resistance.|$|E
