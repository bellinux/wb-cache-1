25|$|Gender inequality, however, is not {{increasing}} or decreasing in a collinear fashion among these predominantly Muslim states. In Afghanistan, for example, gender inequality, {{as measured by}} the index, improved by 2% from 2005 to 2008 but then declined by 2% from 2008 to 2011. In Iraq, the GII score jumped by 9% from 2005 to 2008 but then leveled off in 2011. Turkey, Indonesia, Tunisia, and Pakistan have seen consistent improves to gender equality since 2005. Due to the broad, general nature of the indicators, the minimal and narrow data used to compile the three categories which compose the indicator, and innumerable political and socio-economic issues which may increase or decrease gender inequality, nothing definitive can be said <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> gender inequality or its growth trend in many predominantly Muslim nations.|$|E

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 19 August 1852, Atlantic left Buffalo, heading for Detroit, {{under the command of}} Captain J. Byron Pettey. Every cabin was full, and over 250 passengers were on the deck, many Norwegian, Irish, or other European immigrants. Atlantic stopped at Erie, Pennsylvania to pick up even more Norwegian immigrants waiting for ships to take them west to Detroit. Around half of the immigrants waiting were taken aboard; roughly seventy had to be left behind due to lack of space. Atlantic was now dangerously overcrowded, with 500-600 people aboard; the ship's clerk did not keep an exact count. Baggage was piled on the deck, and passengers stayed wherever they could, including on the uppermost hurricane deck and the roof of Atlantic cabin. At 11 pm on 19 August Atlantic left Erie. The lake was calm; the sources are unclear <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> visibility, with reports indicating everything from a light mist to a heavy fog.|$|E
25|$|There is dispute <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> {{subsidies}} paid to {{the fossil}} fuel industry in Australia. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) argues that according to the definitions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), fossil fuel production and use is subsidised in Australia by means of direct payments, favourable tax treatment, and other actions. It is suggested these measures act as impediments to investment in renewable energy resources. Analysis by the ACF indicates that these provisions {{add up to a}} total annual subsidy of A$7.7billion, with the most significant component being the Fuel Tax Credits program that rebates diesel fuel excise to many business users. This analysis is disputed by the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) who argue that the ACF's definition of a subsidy differs from that of the OECD and that the fuel tax rebate schemes are in place to ensure that all producers are treated equally from a tax point of view. However, the IPA acknowledges that regardless of perceived issues with the ACF analysis, some level of fossil fuel subsidy is likely in existence.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, a {{young man}} accosted Romalis in the medical {{building}} where he works and stabbed him. The doctor was not seriously injured. The criminal was not identified. Several witnesses had seen the attacker waiting for some time before Romalis arrived and even used a restroom in a pharmacy that opens onto the lobby. They described him as a white man in his 20s or 30s wearing a dark grey or black sweatsuit with a hood. When Romalis arrived, the attacker stabbed {{him in the back}} of the lower left ribcage. The man escaped through the parking lot of the building. A parking valet, Jesse Brouwer, chased the attacker for more than a block without success. News reports stated that about an hour before the stabbing, police were called to another clinic, Everywoman's Health Centre because of aggressive anti-abortion protesters on the lawn of the house next door. Three white men, two of whom had not been there before, were trying to intimidate women entering the clinic. The staff became so concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> intimidation that they called police. After police talked to them, the three men left about noon.

25|$|The protests {{started with}} a 3,000-large {{demonstration}} in Târgu Mureș on 12 January, {{as a sign of}} solidarity with Raed Arafat. In the following weeks, protests spread to other sixty Romanian cities and dozens of cities in the Romanian diaspora. In Bucharest, the largest protest took place on 19 January, when up to 20,000 people expressed their disagreements with Băsescu regime. Several days, Bucharest faced widespread rioting and acts of vandalism. Thousands of policemen and gendarmes were deployed on the streets to confront angry demonstrators that stoned the vehicles of the law enforcers, vandalized shops and burned cars. Riot police used tear gas and flares to repel demonstrators who blocked traffic in the center of Bucharest. According to the Gendarmerie, destructions were caused by football ultras infiltrated among peaceful demonstrators. During these days of turmoil, several protesters entered the Romanian Television headquarters to blame the broadcaster for censorship. Official figures indicated over 60 injuries during clashes between police and protesters, while up to 283 arrests were made. Several journalists were injured while transmitting live the events.

25|$|The {{somewhat}} {{thin and}} fragile shell is {{small compared to}} what is known from the other achatinids in southern Africa, its length/height is less than 45mm with about 7½ whorls. (This description is in contradiction to Connolly (1925), who probably attributes a wrongly identified shell 63.2mm long to this taxon – a statement not repeated in his 1939 monograph.) The length is always more than two times the maximum diameter, which is situated at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> {{the apex of the}} aperture. The length of the aperture is always less than half that of the shell; the length of the last whorl in front view is always under three quarters of the total length. The apex is comparatively blunt. The whorls are hardly convex, including the body whorl. The aperture is fairly narrow (greatest width just under the middle) with a thin outer lip; the columella is white, short and narrow, concave with a slight twist, obliquely truncate close to the base. The nepionic whorls are wrinkled and granulose, though always worn in the material studied. The sculpture consists of regular and close wrinkles resulting in a reticulate-granulate pattern, very prominent below the sutures but well visible on all whorls; in addition there are very faint growth striae. All specimens exhibit a close and fine zebra pattern with irregular, orange-brown flames on a yellowish-brown background; there is a very thin and deciduous periostracum. On the whole this seems to be a well-defined taxon because of the size, shape and sculpture of the shell.|$|E

30|$|Finally, one {{important}} clarification: 2010 CFPS {{did not ask}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> education <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first spouse; thus, no information was gathered <b>about</b> <b>the</b> education <b>level</b> <b>of</b> a female spouse who had not completed an individual questionnaire nor <b>about</b> <b>the</b> education <b>level</b> <b>of</b> those already divorced or widowed. In the panel survey in 2012, CFPS supplemented this question, allowing us to draw the missing values from the new responses. However, due to various causes, {{there are also some}} missing values for female spouse’s education level, especially for those who had previously divorced. In order to avoid losing too many cases, we added a category named “missing value” when there were problems with the female spouse’s education level.|$|R
