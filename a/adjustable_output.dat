25|$|Nevertheless, MOSFETs {{are widely}} used in many types of analog {{circuits}} because of their own advantages (zero gate current, high and <b>adjustable</b> <b>output</b> impedance and improved robustness vs. BJTs which can be permanently degraded by even lightly breaking down the emitter-base). The characteristics and performance of many analog circuits can be scaled up or down by changing the sizes (length and width) of the MOSFETs used. By comparison, in bipolar transistors {{the size of the}} device does not significantly affect its performance. MOSFETs' ideal characteristics regarding gate current (zero) and drain-source offset voltage (zero) also make them nearly ideal switch elements, and also make switched capacitor analog circuits practical. In their linear region, MOSFETs can be used as precision resistors, which can have a much higher controlled resistance than BJTs. In high power circuits, MOSFETs sometimes have the advantage of not suffering from thermal runaway as BJTs do. Also, MOSFETs can be configured to perform as capacitors and gyrator circuits which allow op-amps made from them to appear as inductors, thereby allowing all of the normal analog devices on a chip (except for diodes, which can be made smaller than a MOSFET anyway) to be built entirely out of MOSFETs. This means that complete analog circuits can be made on a silicon chip in a much smaller space and with simpler fabrication techniques. MOSFETS are ideally suited to switch inductive loads because of tolerance to inductive kickback.|$|E

40|$|This conference {{paper is}} closed access. It was {{presented}} at the the 24 th EUPVSEC: www. photovoltaic-conference. comPhotovoltaic devices increase in complexity and thus introduce new calibration challenges, largely being affected by deviations of test spectrum from natural spectra. Future energy rating standards will impose further challenges as one needs to simulate realistic sunlight spectra conditions. Generally only light intensity and module temperature can be varied in a solar simulator, which means that they do not provide the variability of environmental conditions and it maintains problematic to measure multi-junction solar cells. A solution to this is to use LEDs instead of the traditional light source in a simulator. Their unique characteristics allow precise intensity adjustment and the combination of a steady state with a flash solar simulator, thus providing high flexibility. With the LEDs availability in colours over the whole spectrum, the AM 1. 5 G spectrum can be accurately represented with the benefit of an <b>adjustable</b> spectral <b>output.</b> CREST has designed and constructed an LED-based solar simulator prototype of which the hardware set-up as well as classification results and PV device and repeatability measurements are presented.
