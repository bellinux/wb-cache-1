40|$|Abstract. The <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> {{occupies}} the irreplaceable {{position in the}} development of industrial automation. An <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> is often required to convey parts to complete a series of processes in a modern production line. But the traditional <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> has problems of large volume, high noise and low efficiency. It has reduced the efficiency of production line. So it is necessary to make innovation for the <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> system. A new type of <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> based on linear servo motor is proposed in the paper. This device overcomes some disadvantages of the traditional <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>device.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{many studies}} with animals kept in groups, {{scientists}} need information about each individual's food access without disturbance or {{separation of the}} animals. We developed an <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> that allows measurement of individual food consumption and experimental manipulation of individual food availability in small social mammals, such as house mice. The <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> is based on radio frequency identification that triggers access to a motor-driven metal arm filled with food pellets and is mediated {{with the help of}} subcutaneously implanted transponders...|$|R
40|$|Much {{interest}} has developed {{in recent years}} in a procedure to rear neonatal pigs by use of <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> equipment. Several <b>devices</b> of similar design have been used for both sterile, disease free environments utilizing hysterectomy or cesarean-derived pigs and for pigs born normally and taken from the sow at 8 - 36 hours post-partum. The purpose of the research reported herein was to determine if an automated <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> could be used to rear naturally-farrowed and hysterectomy-derived pigs with good performance and survival rate. Three experiments were conducted using 34 crossbred neonatal piglets to determine the feasibility of rearing newborn pigs with an <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>device.</b> In addition, three trials were conducted with 49 crossbred hysterectomy-derived pigs to study the requirements of disease-free pigs in terms of diets and management considerations. The major problem encountered throughout the six tests was microbial scours. Rotation of the drugs being used apparently countered the buildup of resistance in the organism(s) responsible. The hysterectomy pigs were more susceptible to scours {{due to a lack of}} passive immunity. Pig weight at birth appeared to be the most significant factor affecting survival. This relationship was true for both normal birth and hysterectomy-derived pigs. Advisor:E. R. Peo, Jr...|$|R

40|$|Aim of {{the current}} study was to {{evaluate}} the clinical/health status of veal calves in 3 farms that adopt large group housing and <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> stations in Italy. Visits were scheduled in three phases of the rearing cycle (early, middle, and end). Results showed a high incidence of coughing, skin infection and bloated rumen particularly in the middle phase while cross-sucking signs were present at the early stage when calves’ nibbling proclivity is still high. Throughout the rearing cycle, the frequency of bursitis increased reaching 53 % of calves at the end. The percentage of calves with a poorer body condition than the mid-range of the batch raised gradually as well, likely due to the non-proportioned teat/calves ratio that increases competition for feed and reduces milk intake of the low ranking animals. The remarked growth differences among pen-mates and the mortality rate close to 7 % showed by the use of <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>devices</b> for milk delivery seem not compensating the lower labour demand, therefore its sustainability at the present status is doubtful both for the veal calves’ welfare and the farm incomes...|$|R

40|$|In general, demand <b>feeding</b> <b>devices</b> are {{equipped}} with a mechanical trigger switch. Such a switch is not suitable for juvenile fish with a small body size, because the body weight is insufficient to trigger the feeder. An infrared light sensor that {{does not require the}} fish to push a feeder switch is more suitable for small fish. The brown-marbled grouper Epinephelus fuscoguttatus is an important fish species in Southeast Asia. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the growth rates (GRs) of brown-marbled grouper juveniles reared using customised demand <b>feeding</b> <b>devices</b> with an infrared light sensor (the infrared light demand feeder (IRDF) group) and <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>devices</b> (the <b>automatic</b> feeder (AF) group). The results indicated that GRs of standard lengths and body weights showed no significant differences using one-way analysis of variance; however, the standard length of the IRDF group showed a tendency of a higher GR than the AF group. Although the feed conversion ratio (FCR) also showed no significant difference, the FCR of the IRDF group was more efficient, indicating that the IRDF group yielded a more desirable FCR. These results indicate that IRDF can be used in the culture of brown-marbled grouper juveniles. In view of the working schedule of the fish farm staff, IRDF are superior to other <b>feeding</b> <b>devices,</b> because they are less labour-intensive than usual tasks. We conclude that IRDF is a useful feeding system for aquaculture...|$|R
40|$|Compounded feeds {{have been}} one of the {{essential}} requisites in the development of aquaculture. Rearing of larvae in the hatchery, postal larval rearing in the nursery until they become stockable size and their subsequent culture in grow-out ponds require appropriate and nutritionally balanced compounded feeds. Compounded feeds have many advantages. By understanding the nutritional requirements of the candidate species of culture, nutritionally well balanced feeds could be formulated using low-cost feedstuffs available in the concerned region. These feeds could be prepared in large quantities with good shelf life and can be used off the shelf wherever and whenever required. Preparation of compounded feed does not require extensive area and highly skilled man power. High efficiency of the feed could be achieved by judicious manipulation of feed ingredients and can be made economically feasible. Dispensing of compounded feeds is quite convenient over large farm areas and <b>automatic</b> <b>feed</b> dispensing <b>devices</b> could be successfully employed...|$|R
