40|$|Stearate {{intercalated}} layered double hydroxide was synthesized by reacting {{the corresponding}} carbonate form {{with a large}} excess of stearic acid. Thermal analysis, FTIR, XRD and SEMEDS characterization indicated {{the formation of a}} highly crystalline bilayer-intercalated product. The composition of the inorganic portion showed high variability in the Al:Mg atom ratio. This suggests that the crystals comprised stacks of randomly interstratified layers that varied in compositions from one close to magnesium stearate to one similar to <b>aluminium</b> <b>distearate.</b> The rheology of the jojoba oil suspensions containing this material showed strong shear thinning behaviour and also an anomalous temperature dependence.
