5|$|A slow-moving {{predator}} feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the sicklefin lemon shark seldom travels long distances and many individuals {{can be found}} year-round at certain locations. Like other members of its family, this species is viviparous, with females giving birth {{to no more than}} 13 pups every other year, following a gestation period of 1011 months. Although they are potentially dangerous to humans <b>and</b> <b>known</b> to respond vigorously to any provocation, under normal circumstances, sicklefin lemon sharks are cautious and tend to retreat if approached. The IUCN has assessed this species as Vulnerable; its low reproductive productivity and rate of movement limits the capacity of depleted stocks to recover. Off India and Southeast Asia, this species has been severely depleted or extirpated by unregulated exploitation for its meat, fins, and liver oil.|$|E
