5|$|The {{season was}} one of the best in the team's history, with 20 {{victories}} and <b>a</b> <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France with multiple noteworthy performances. Team leader Thomas Voeckler wore the yellow jersey as race leader for ten days; the second such occurrence of his career, after also leading for ten days in 2004. Unlike that race, however, Voeckler poised himself as a serious overall contender and took fourth place overall; the best result by a French rider since 2000. While he spent most of the Tour riding in Voeckler's service, Pierre Rolland won one of the marquee stages, up Alpe d'Huez, eventually finishing 11th overall and winning the young rider classification.|$|E

25|$|Britain {{had limited}} success with cycle racing in the 20th century. This has changed when the {{performance}} director of British Cycling Peter Keen (formerly coach of Chris Boardman and later appointed in 2003 as performance director with UK Sport) obtained lottery funding which helped cycling at both grass roots and at an elite level. Progress {{was made in}} the 2004 Summer Olympics under Keen's successor Dave Brailsford, where Chris Hoy and Bradley Wiggins won golds - the first time the British team had won two golds in track cycling since 1908, whilst Great Britain won 11 medals at the 2007 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, seven of them gold, and nine gold medals at the 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Manchester. The investment paid off in the 2008 Olympics; British cyclists brought home gold medals in seven events, most notably Chris Hoy who became the first British Olympian to win three golds at one Olympiad, earning him a knighthood. Other successes include Rebecca Romero and Victoria Pendleton. Success at road racing was also limited, with the United Kingdom being the only major nation not to have <b>a</b> <b>Tour</b> <b>de</b> France champion, until Bradley Wiggins' victory in the 2012 Tour de France. This newfound British success continued with Chris Froome winning four of the next five Tours (2013, 2015, 2016, 2017). In addition to Wiggins and Froome, other British riders to enjoy a level of success include Tom Simpson, Barry Hoban, Robert Millar, Chris Boardman, David Millar, and Mark Cavendish. Britain has had some success in women's cycle racing in producing 4 road racing world champions including Beryl Burton, Mandy Jones, Lizzie Armistead and Nicole Cooke who won the Olympic road race title and the world championship in the same year in 2008. Emma Pooley won the world road time trial championship in 2010.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{recorded}} at the Darryl F.

Before the recording session took part, the main voice actors of the show (Dan Castellaneta, Harry Shearer, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, and Hank Azaria) sat down with executive producer David Mirkin and a crew of writers at a table reading to determine what shape the script was in. There was [...] "genuine hearty laughter at various points" [...] during the script run-through, said Ray Richmond, a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News. Immediately after the reading, the crew of writers hurried to make script changes based on what got laughs and what did not, while the actors waited impatiently. Mirkin told Richmond that the script would require the equivalent of ten rewrites: [...] "At every step, there are amendments and additions and refinements." [...] Richmond commented that as the recording session started, the [...] "astounding versatility" [...] of the actors became clear; [...] "Castellaneta bounces from being Homer to Grampa to Barney without taking a breath and minus any evident vocal similarities." [...] Mirkin said the episode was also <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> <b>de</b> force for Kavner, who in one scene voices Marge, Marge's two sisters, and Marge's mother. He added that even though she enjoyed the process, it was tough on Kavner's voice because those characters talk with [...] "gravelly voices".|$|E

The Music Network complimented {{the production of the}} video while simultaneously making reference to Christina Aguilera and criticising the latter for her new video for her single [...] "Not Myself Tonight", writing: [...] "...housework has never looked so good ... Proving you don't have to wear bondage gear and a ball-gag to be sexy (hello Christina!), the 50s-style video sees the R queen [...] getting dirty in a different way: dusting her Grammys, watering the plants and scrubbing the shower in vintage lingerie... She can come over to our house anytime." [...] Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard magazine commented on Knowles' [...] "dominatrix costume" [...] at the end to Rihanna's Rated R era. She finally complimented the music video by saying that [...] "Beyoncé's shamelessly campy performance—complete with boatloads of running mascara—is generously refreshing." [...] Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy noted that the video was [...] "kind of <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> <b>de</b> force" [...] and compared it with the one for [...] "Telephone" [...] (2010).

[...] A contemporary review in Architecture commented that Mudd [...] "responds {{on a variety of}} levels to its context, but it does so without sacrificing its own unique and powerful identity." [...] Margaret Gaskie also praised the building's placement and contextualization among its fellow structures in a 1986 issue of Architectural Record: [...] "the scale of the structure beneath its outcroppings is sympathetic to the existing buildings in the quad, and its mass, though larger, [...] appropriate to its role as a gateway between them and the central campus". She went on to positively comment on the building's aesthetics, saying, [...] "the eye can feast on the mingled sparkle and luminosity drawn from minimal outdoor exposures used to maximum effect. In more public areas, where crisp glass-block and lucent glass ignite clear deep-timbered tones and pretty pastels, the feast becomes a banquet." [...] Crosbie in Architecture noted [...] "some instances of shoddy drywall work and sloppy painting" [...] but otherwise praised the building's [...] "bare-bones" [...] and [...] "nuts and bolts" [...] interior as functional and environmentally friendly. The Platt Byard Dovell White report found that Mudd's glass walls [...] "seem to function particularly poorly" [...] as a passive heat control system but otherwise noted that the structure's expressive postmodernist ambitions marked it as [...] "a strong, compact if busy building [...] makes it more than a bit of <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> <b>de</b> force."

500|$|Some {{characters}} {{are present in}} multiple entries of the series, such as Giygas, Mr. Saturn, and Pokey/Porky. Giygas is the primary antagonist in both Mother and EarthBound. The alien creature's emotional complexity deviates from genre norms. Giygas shows internal conflict in Mother and has no appearance but as an [...] "indescribable" [...] force in EarthBound final boss battle. In both final battles, Giygas is defeated through love and prayer instead of through <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> <b>de</b> force of weaponry, unlike the endings of other period games. Nadia Oxford wrote for IGN that nearly two decades later, EarthBound final fight against Giygas continues to be [...] "one of the most epic video game standoffs of all time" [...] with noted emotional impact. This battle's dialogue was based on Itoi's recollections of a traumatic scene from the Shintoho film The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty that he had accidentally seen in his childhood. Oxford wrote for 1UP.com that Itoi intended to show the alien's yearning for love in [...] "a manner ... beyond human understanding". Despite EarthBound and Mother 3 dissimilar settings, the Mr. Saturn fictional species appear in similar Saturn Valleys in both games. The Mr. Saturn look like an old man's head with feet, a large nose, and bald except for a single hair with a bow. Though they are a technologically advanced and peaceful species with a pureness of heart, they are under constant attacks from encroaching enemies. Nadia and David Oxford of 1UP.com considered the Mr. Saturn to be aliens despite their human-like and fleshy appearance, as described a piece arguing the central theme of aliens in the Mother series. They compared the Mr. Saturn to Kurt Vonnegut's Tralfamadorian alien species. Finally, Pokey begins as Ness's child neighbor who [...] "cowers" [...] and [...] "refuses to fight" [...] in EarthBound, but grows into a [...] "vicious control freak with no regard for human life", Porky, {{by the end of}} the series' Mother 3.|$|E
