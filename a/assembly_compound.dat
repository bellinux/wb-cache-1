40|$|Butyrate, {{one of the}} SCFA, {{promotes}} {{the development of the}} intestinal barrier. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the butyrate regulation of the intestinal barrier are unknown. To test the hypothesis that the effect of butyrate on the intestinal barrier is mediated by the regulation of the assembly of tight junctions involving the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), we determined the effect of butyrate on the intestinal barrier by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and inulin permeability in a Caco- 2 cell monolayer model. We further used a calcium switch assay to study the assembly of epithelial tight junctions and determined the effect of butyrate on the assembly of epithelial tight junctions and AMPK activity. We demonstrated that the butyrate treatment increased AMPK activity and accelerated the assembly of tight junctions as shown by the reorganization of tight junction proteins, as well as the development of TER. AMPK activity was also upregulated by butyrate during calcium switch-induced tight junction <b>assembly.</b> <b>Compound</b> C, a specific AMPK inhibitor, inhibited the butyrate-induced activation of AMPK. The facilitating effect of butyrate on the increases in TER in standard culture media, as well as after calcium switch, was abolished by compound C. We conclude that butyrate enhances the intestinal barrier by regulating the assembly of tight junctions. This dynamic process is mediated by the activation of AMPK. These results suggest an intriguing link between SCFA and the intracellular energy sensor {{for the development of the}} intestinal barrier...|$|E

To further evaluate the relevance of LDL-receptor (LDLr) pathway and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in TG homeostasis, we analyzed fasting and postprandial TG levels in mice bearing combined heterozygous mutations in both Exostosin (Ext) 1 and Ldlr, in subjects with hereditary multiple exostosis (HME) due to a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in EXT 1 or EXT 2 (N = 13), and in patients with heterozygous mutations in LDLR [familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) ] and SNPs in major HSPG-related genes (n = 22). Mice bearing a homozygous mutation in hepatic Ext 1 exhibited elevated plasma TGs similar to mice lacking other key enzymes involved in HSPG <b>assembly.</b> <b>Compound</b> heterozygous mice lacking Ldlr and Ext 1 showed synergy on plasma TG accumulation and postprandial clearance. In human subjects, a trend was observed in HME patients toward reduced postprandial TG clearance with a concomitant reduction in chylomicron clearance [area under the curve (AUC) retinyl ester (RE) HME, 844 +/- 127 vs. controls, 646 +/- 119 nM/h, P = 0. 09].

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the intracellular trafficking and release pathways for the therapeutic protein, viral IL- 10 (vIL- 10), from transduced acinar epithelial cells from rabbit lacrimal gland. Primary cultured rabbit lacrimal gland acinar cells (LGACs) were transduced with adenovirus serotype 5 containing viral interleukin- 10 (AdvIL- 10). The distribution of vIL- 10 was assessed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Carbachol (CCH) -stimulated release of vIL- 10 was quantified by ELISA. vIL- 10 localization and exocytosis was probed in response to treatments with agents modulating actin- and myosin-based transport. vIL- 10 immunoreactivity was detected in large intracellular vesicles in transduced LGAC. vIL- 10 was partially co-localized with biosynthetic but not endosomal compartment markers. vIL- 10 release was sensitive to CCH, and the kinetics of release showed an initial burst phase that was similar but not identical to that of the secretory protein, β-hexosaminidase. Disassembly of actin filaments with latrunculin B significantly increased CCH-stimulated vIL- 10 secretion, suggesting that vIL- 10 was released from stores sequestered beneath the subapical actin barrier. That release required the activity of actin-dependent myosin motors previously implicated in secretory vesicle exocytosis was confirmed by findings that CCH-stimulated vIL- 10 release was reduced by inhibition of non-muscle myosin 2 and myosin 5 c function, using ML- 7 and overexpression of dominant negative myosin 5 c, respectively. These results suggest that the majority of vIL- 10 transgene product is packaged into a subpopulation of secretory vesicles that utilize actin-dependent myosin motors for aspects of actin coat <b>assembly,</b> <b>compound</b> fusion and exocytosis at the apical plasma membrane in response to CCH stimulation...|$|E

To facilitate cloning of X. tropicalis mutants identified in forward genetic screens, we sought to combine bulk segregant analysis and exome sequencing into a single step.

We demonstrate that bulk segregant analysis coupled with exon capture sequencing is not only able to identify causative mutations but can also generate linkage information, facilitate the assembly of scaffolds, identify misassembles, and discover thousands of SNPs for fine mapping. Conclusion Exon capture sequencing and bulk segregant analysis is a rapid, inexpensive method to clone mutants identified in forward genetic screens.

The relative importance of these two components of environmental filtering differed between spatial scales. Host composition had a stronger effect on flea assembly than abiotic environment on the continental scale, while the opposite was true for the regional scale.

Many studies {{over the last decade}} have demonstrated that this approach is successful.

These STV–ssDNA motifs were then hybridized with a long ss-DNA that contains sections with sequences complementary to those of the short DNA in STV–ssDNA. This led to the programmed formation of a linear streptavidin array along the long ss-DNA.

The overall symmetry of the OA thus appears to be separable from the more localized assembly of individual basal bodies. True mirror imagery of the membranelles would require new enantiomorphic forms of the individual ciliary components, particularly the basal bodies, which is never observed. These observations suggest a mechanistic hypothesis with implications {{for the development of}} left–right asymmetry not only in ciliates, but perhaps also in development of left–right asymmetry in general...|$|R
40|$|Supramolecular {{materials}} are important {{due to their}} distinct physical and chemical properties. Here we report the synthesis and structural determination, by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, of five new supramolecular networks, namely {[Fe(bpy) (3) OH][dca center dot 4 H(2) O]}(n) (1), {[Fe(bpy) (3) ][Zn(dca) (3) ](2) }(n) (2), {Zn(bpy) (2) (dca) (2) }(n) (3), {Zn(bpy) (dca) (2) }(n) (4) and {[Zn(bpy) (3) ][Fe(dca) (3) ](2) }(n) (5), where bpy = bipyridine and dca = dicyanamide. Compound 1 {{is made up of}} a [Fe(bpy) (3) OH](+) cation layer and a [dca center dot 4 H(2) O](-) anion layer. Water clusters are present in the anionic sheet which link adjacent layers of the supramolecular <b>assembly</b> of <b>compound</b> 1. The anionic layer consists of randomly orientated dca anions and water clusters, while the cationic layer has randomly occupied OH groups. Compounds 2 and 5 have similar molecular connectivity to a previously reported structure, but with a different combination of metal centres. They contain a two-dimensional {[M'(dca) (3) (-) }(n) network which provides perfect hexagonal pockets for [M(bpy) (3) ](2 +) cations. Compound 3 consists of neutral distorted octahedral monomeric units and these monomeric units are connected through intermolecular hydrogen bonding, forming a 3 D network. One of anionic dca ligands in compound 3 is also randomly orientated. Compound 4 possesses a zig-zag 1 D chain structure and a 3 D framework is generated through weak interactions between aromatic rings of adjacent layers. All five compounds contain both bpy and dca. The crystallization of these compounds depends highly on the experimental conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|Drug {{delivery}} systems are nanoparticles made of lipid and/or polymer <b>assemblies,</b> carrying a <b>compound</b> {{to a site}} {{of interest in the}} body [1, 2]. A major class of drug {{delivery systems}} is made by liposomes, which consist of hollow containers limited by a lipid bilayer [3, 4]. Liposomes are biocompatible and able to transport a wide range of compounds, either in their hydrophilic aqueous compartment or in their lipophilic limiting membrane [5, 6]. In order to allow efficient drug delivery in vivo, liposomes must present long circulation time and accumulate in desired tissues or organs. This is achieved with liposomes of small size, around 100 -nm diameter, coated with an inert layer of hydrophilic and biocompatible polymers, usually made of poly-ethylene-glycol (PEG) moieties [7 – 9]. The addressing of liposomes to a desired site is realized either by passive targeting, that is by accumulation in areas with enhanced permeable vasculature, via the so-called enhanced permeability and retention effect [10], or by active targeting via the attachment of a homing device to the liposome [11].|$|R
