5|$|All have paddle-like tails <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> {{laterally}} compressed {{bodies that}} {{give them an}} eel-like appearance. Unlike fish, {{they do not have}} gills and must surface regularly to breathe. Along with whales, they are among the most completely aquatic of all air-breathing vertebrates. Among this group are species {{with some of the most}} potent venoms of all snakes. Some have gentle dispositions and bite only when provoked, but others are much more aggressive. Currently, 17genera are described as sea snakes, comprising 62 species.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{pioneering}} efforts by Olav Selvaag and others, archaic and otherwise unnecessary restrictions were relaxed, improving opportunities for more Norwegians to build housing to suit their individual needs and preferences. Norwegians often undertake home improvement projects on their own, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> built most of their own homes.|$|E

5|$|FreeBSD is {{developed}} by a volunteer team located around the world. The developers use the Internet for all communication <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> not met each other in person. In addition to local user groups sponsored and attended by users, an annual conference, called BSDcon, is held by USENIX. BSDcon is not FreeBSD-specific so it deals with {{the technical aspects of}} all BSD operating systems, including OpenBSD and NetBSD. In addition to BSDcon, three other annual conferences, EuroBSDCon, AsiaBSDCon and BSDCan take place in Europe, Japan and Canada respectively.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s to the present, Apple {{has been}} {{plaintiff}} or defendant in civil {{actions in the}} United States and other countries. Some of these actions have determined significant case law for the information technology industry <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> {{captured the attention of}} the public and media. Apple's litigation generally involves intellectual property disputes, but the company has also been a party in lawsuits that include antitrust claims, consumer actions, commercial unfair trade practice suits, defamation claims, and corporate espionage, among other matters.|$|E
5|$|It was {{designed}} to be carried in a coat pocket or kept on a night-stand, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> survived to the present day in good condition, having seen little actual use. Numerous copies of this design were made during the late 19th century in Belgium, with smaller numbers also produced in Spain, France and the USA. They remained reasonably popular until the Second World War, but are now generally sought after only as collectors' pieces, since ammunition for them is for the most part no longer commercially manufactured.|$|E

5|$|Its great {{distance}} and surprising activity indicated that comet Hale–Bopp might become very bright indeed when it reached perihelion in 1997. However, comet scientists were wary – comets {{can be extremely}} unpredictable, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> large outbursts at {{great distance}} only to diminish in brightness later. Comet Kohoutek in 1973 had been touted as a 'comet of the century' and {{turned out to be}} unspectacular.|$|E
5|$|Northampton Museum {{maintains}} a Concealed Shoe Index, which by 2012 contained 1900 reports of discoveries, mostly from Britain and almost half from the 19th century. The overwhelming majority have been worn, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> been repaired. Most finds are of single shoes, {{about half of}} them belonging to children.|$|E
5|$|One-third of Sri Lankan Tamils {{now live}} outside Sri Lanka. While there was {{significant}} migration during the British colonial period, {{the civil war}} led to more than 800,000Tamils leaving Sri Lanka, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> left the country for destinations such as Canada, India and Europe as refugees.|$|E

50|$|A heavy fighter is {{a fighter}} {{aircraft}} designed to carry heavier weapons or operate at longer ranges than light fighter aircraft. To achieve acceptable performance, most heavy fighters were twin-engined, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>had</b> multi-place crews.|$|R
50|$|Creditors, most of {{whom were}} {{advertising}} agencies, were owed around £12 million. Over 400 staff and contractors were made redundant in London and around the world, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>had</b> not been paid for several months.|$|R
5|$|Parasitoids {{lay their}} eggs on or {{in the body of}} an insect host, which is then used as a food for {{developing}} larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Most insect parasitoids are wasps or flies, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> a very narrow host range. The most important groups are the ichneumonid wasps, which mainly use caterpillars as hosts; braconid wasps, which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including aphids; chalcid wasps, which parasitize eggs and larvae of many insect species; and tachinid flies, which parasitize a wide range of insects including caterpillars, beetle adults and larvae, and true bugs.|$|E
5|$|Red-veined Darter – {{following}} influxes {{in previous}} years, this species, like Yellow-winged Darter, has formed temporary breeding colonies. However, since the mid-1990s, {{the number of}} these colonies has increased <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> continued to be present from year-to-year, so this species is now better regarded as a successful colonist.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{the family}} is {{generally}} very bright and in most species is mostly or at least partly green, although the two carmine bee-eaters are mostly rose-coloured. Most of the Merops bee-eaters have a black bar through the eye <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> differently coloured throats and faces. The extent of the green in these species varies from almost complete in the green bee-eater to barely any green in the white-throated bee-eater. Three species, from equatorial Africa, have no green at all in their plumage, the black bee-eater, the blue-headed bee-eater and the rosy bee-eater. Many species have elongated central tail feathers.|$|E

5|$|The plumage of {{woodpeckers}} {{varies from}} drab to conspicuous. The colours of many species {{are based on}} olive and brown and some are pied, suggesting a need for camouflage; others are boldly patterned in black, white and red, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> a crest or tufted feathers on the crown. Woodpeckers tend to be sexually dimorphic, but differences between the sexes are generally small; exceptions to this are Williamson's sapsucker and the orange-backed woodpecker, which differ markedly. The plumage is moulted fully once a year apart from the wrynecks, which have an additional partial moult before breeding.|$|E
5|$|Above the course, zones {{four and}} five, as {{identified}} by Cockerell, contain figures which represent the Christian Church in Britain, with the spiritual lords such as bishops, abbots, abbesses and saintly founders of monasteries on the south, while kings, queens and princes occupy the north. Many {{of the figures}} survive <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> been identified {{in the light of}} their various attributes. There is a hierarchy of size, with the more significant figures larger and enthroned in their niches rather than standing. Immediately beneath the upper course are a series of small niches containing dynamic sculptures of the dead coming forth from their tombs on the Day of Judgement. Although naked, some of the dead are defined as royalty by their crowns and others as bishops by their mitres. Some emerge from their graves with joy and hope, and others with despair.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, {{amateur astronomers}} observe {{a variety of}} {{celestial}} objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, {{and a variety of}} deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.|$|E
25|$|Chinsamy and Trexler {{noted that}} the fossil record of basal neoceratopsians is {{actually}} of relatively high quality.

5|$|Most of {{the guns}} that sank with Kronan were {{salvaged}} in the 1680s, but eventually the wreck fell into obscurity. Its exact position was rediscovered in 1980 by the amateur researcher Anders Franzén, who had also located the 17th-century warship Vasa in the 1950s. Yearly diving operations have since surveyed and excavated the wreck site and salvaged artifacts, and Kronan {{has become the most}} widely publicized shipwreck in the Baltic after Vasa. More than 30,000 artifacts have been recovered, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> been conserved and put on permanent public display at the Kalmar County Museum in Kalmar. The museum is responsible for the maritime archaeological operations and the permanent exhibitions on Kronan.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{debates over}} the Harry Potter series of books by J. K. Rowling are based on claims that the novels contain occult or Satanic subtexts. A number of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians have argued against the series, as have some Shia and Sunni Muslims. Supporters of the series {{have said that the}} magic in Harry Potter bears little {{resemblance}} to occultism, being more in the vein of fairy tales such as Cinderella and Snow White, or to the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, both of whom are known for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts. Far from promoting a particular religion, some argue, the Harry Potter novels {{go out of their way}} to avoid discussing religion at all. However, the author of the series, J. K. Rowling, describes herself as a practising Christian, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> noted the Christian references which she includes in the final novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.|$|E

Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>have</b> consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. However, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still maintains relations with Taiwan and supplies it with military equipment).|$|E
