40|$|Aim: {{several studies}} have {{suggested}} a beneficial effect of infant breastfeeding on childhood cognitive function. The main objective was to examine whether duration of breastfeeding and <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>introduction</b> of complementary foods are related to cognitive performance in 9 - to 10 -year-old school-aged children in South India. Methods: the authors examined 514 children from the Mysore Parthenon birth cohort for whom breastfeeding duration (six categories from < 3 to ? 18 months) and <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>introduction</b> of complementary foods (four categories from < 4 to ? 6 months) were collected at the first-, second- and third-year annual follow-up visits. Their cognitive function was assessed at {{a mean age of}} 9. 7 years using three core tests from the Kaufman Assessment Battery for children and additional tests measuring long-term retrieval/storage, attention and concentration, visuo-spatial and verbal abilities. Results: all the children were initially breastfed. The mode for duration of breastfeeding was 12 – 17 months (45. 7 %) and for <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>introduction</b> of complementary foods 4 months (37. 1 %). There were no associations between longer duration of breastfeeding, or age of introduction of complementary foods, and cognitive function at 9 – 10 years, either unadjusted or after adjustment for age, sex, gestation, birth size, maternal age, parity, socio-economic status, parents' attained schooling and rural/urban residence. Conclusions: within this cohort, in which prolonged breastfeeding was the norm (90 % breastfed ? 6 months and 65 % breastfed for ? 12 months), there was no evidence suggesting a beneficial effect of longer duration of breastfeeding on later cognitive ability...|$|E

These associations may be explained by cardiovascular developmental adaptations in childhood in response to specific infant feeding patterns. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding and timing of introduction of solid foods affect cardiovascular development in childhood. In a population-based prospective cohort study from fetal life onward, information about duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding and timing of introduction of solid foods was obtained from delivery reports and questionnaires. Blood pressure, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), left atrial diameter (LAD), aortic root diameter (AOD), left ventricular (LV) mass, and fractional shortening (FS) were measured at a median age of 6. 0 y (95 % range: 5. 6 - 7. 4 y). Analyses were based on 5003 children. <b>Age</b> <b>at</b> <b>introduction</b> of solid foods was negatively associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the age of 6 y. Compared with children who had ever been breast-fed, never-breast-fed children had a higher carotid-femoral PWV (β: 0. 13 m/s; 95 % CI: 0. 03, 0. 24 m/s), a smaller LAD (β: 20. 29 mm; 95 % CI: 20. 55, 20. 03 mm), and less LV mass (b: 21. 46 g; 95 % CI: 22. 41, 20. 52 g) at the age of 6 y.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the factors explaining the variability in fat and carbohydrate intake during infancy. We aimed to describe infants' fat and carbohydrate intake and analyse the associations with infant and maternal characteristics and feeding practices. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This study included 1275 infants aged 8 months from the French EDEN mother-child cohort. Carbohydrate intake, fat intake, added fat (vegetable oils and animal fats) and added sugar (honey, white sugar, brown sugar, jam and sweetened beverages) consumption were calculated at 8 and 12 months. Associations between these variables and infant and maternal characteristics as well as maternal dietary patterns during pregnancy, breast-feeding duration and <b>age</b> <b>at</b> complementary feeding <b>introduction</b> were analysed using multivariable linear and logistic regressions. RESULTS: Less than 5 % of non-breast-fed infants reached the recommendation of consuming at least 40 % of total energy from fat, whereas more than 95 % of them reached 45 % of energy from carbohydrates. Overall, infant and maternal characteristics and maternal diet during pregnancy were marginally associated with both carbohydrate/added sugar and fat/added fat intake. Nevertheless, <b>age</b> <b>at</b> complementary feeding <b>introduction</b> was associated with all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that only a small proportion of non-breast-fed infants at 8 and 12 months reached the recommendations for fat intake, whereas a majority of them reached the recommendations for carbohydrate intake. As subgroups of infants with a higher risk of inadequate diet were not identified, the present results call for an improved dissemination of information regarding infant-specific dietary fat needs in the entire population...|$|R
40|$|Background: Early {{introduction}} of solid food has been suspected to induce excessive infant energy intake and weight gain. Objective: The {{objective of this}} study was to test whether {{introduction of}} solid foods influences energy intake or growth. Design: Healthy, formula-fed infants who were recruited in 5 European countries were eligible for study participation. Anthropometric measurements were taken at recruitment and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 mo. Time of introduction of solid foods and energy intake were determined by questionnaires and 3 -d weighed food records at monthly intervals. <b>Age</b> <b>at</b> <b>introduction</b> of solid food was categorized into 4 groups: ≤ 13 wk, 14 - 17 wk, 18 - 21 wk, and ≥ 22 wk. Results: Of 1090 recruited infants, 830 (76 %) had data available for age at first introduction of solid food, and 671 (61 %) completed the study until 24 mo of age. The median <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>introduction</b> of solid food was 19 wk. The time of introduction of solid foods was associated with country, sex, birth weight, parental education and marital status, and maternal smoking. Energy intake was higher in the first 8 mo of life in children with solid-food intake. Solid-food introduction did not predict anthropometric measures at 24 mo. Growth trajectories differed significantly: children with solid-food introduction in the first 12 wk experienced early catch-up growth, whereas those introduced to solid food at > 22 wk of age grew more slowly and stayed on lower trajectories. Conclusions: Solid foods do not simply replace infant formula but increase energy intake. Time of introduction of solid food has little influence on infant growth.

40|$|Celiac disease (CD) affects about 1 % of the Western population. Individuals with CD suffer {{increased}} risk {{of a number of}} comorbid conditions, including certain malignancies and diabetes mellitus type 1. The pathogenesis of CD is poorly understood. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in individuals with CD. These studies were carried out with the objective to obtain increased knowledge regarding CD characteristics, in order to optimally design the care of individuals with CD and identify possible groups with {{increased risk}} of CD. A separate aim of this thesis was to further investigate the pathogenesis of CD, by assessing the effect of infectious disease at time of gluten introduction on the risk of future CD. The risk of VTE was assessed in a cohort of 14, 207 individuals with a discharge diagnosis of CD. When investigating renal complications (ESRD and IgAN), studies were based on a CD cohort identified through Swedish biopsy registers (about 29, 000 individuals). Cox regression was used to investigate the associations between CD and outcome data in these population-based cohort studies. For the last study, we used the All Babies in Southeast Sweden (ABIS) population-based cohort study, where parents of 9, 408 children prospectively completed a diary with feeding data and parent-reported infections during the child’s first year of life. The pediatric departments in the area reported children diagnosed with CD. We found a modestly {{increased risk of}} VTE in CD (Hazard ratio, HR, 1. 86; 95 % Confidence interval, CI, 1. 54 - 2. 24). Individuals with biopsy-verified CD suffered a three-fold increased risk of future ESRD (HR, 2. 87; 95 % CI 2. 22 - 3. 71). Individuals with biopsy-verified CD also suffered increased risk of future biopsy-verified IgAN (HR, 3. 03; 95 % CI 1. 22 - 7. 56). Although parent-reported infections were more common among children with CD (p= 0. 035), we found no increased risk of CD among children with any reported infection (HR, 1. 8; 95 % CI 0. 9 - 3. 6) or gastroenteritis (HR, 2. 6; 95 % CI 0. 2 - 30. 8) at time of gluten introduction (analyses adjusted for <b>age</b> <b>at</b> gluten <b>introduction,</b> <b>age</b> <b>at</b> end of breastfeeding, and <b>age</b> <b>at</b> any infection). We conclude that CD is associated with a modestly increased risk of VTE, and that CD is a risk factor for future ESRD and IgAN. Although absolute risks are low, our findings warrant increased awareness regarding renal function in the care of individuals with CD. Future studies should evaluate the effect of adherence to a gluten-free diet to potentially identify individuals at risk. Infection at time of gluten introduction {{does not seem to be}} a major risk factor for future CD. In a setting where adherence to infant feeding guidelines is high, duration of breastfeeding and <b>age</b> <b>at</b> gluten <b>introduction</b> are no major risk factors for CD.

40|$|Weaning {{practices}} {{including the}} age of the infant at time of weaning, nutritional composition of the weaning diet and rapid weight gain have been suggested to be risk factors for overweight and obesity in childhood. The purpose of this review was to investigate the relationship between weaning practices and overweight and obesity in childhood (from birth to 18 yrs) and to identify the risk factors associated with weaning for overweight and obesity in childhood (birth to 18 yrs). This was achieved through a systematic review of relevant literature, identified using a number of databases such as CINAHL, EMBASE, and MEDLINE and through searching individual journals. Inclusion criteria consisted of children’s age 0 - 18 yrs, details on stage of and weaning diet, studies published in English from 2000 - 2010 and human studies. The quality of the methodology of studies was assessed using the Downs & Black (1998) quality assessment tool. Thirteen studies out of an original 67 were included in the review. Study sizes varied from 90 to 10, 553 subjects and quality assessment scores ranged from 14 to 23. All of the studies which considered the relationship between <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>introduction</b> of complementary foods and weight gain found those infants weaned before 16 weeks (wks) gained more weight than those weaned later; these findings were more significant in those infants who were not breastfed or breastfed for less than 4 wks. One study (from 5) found a significant relationship between the <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>introduction</b> of complementary foods and overweight and obesity. Four studies (from 5) reported a significant relationship between nutritional composition of the weaning diet {{during the first year of}} life and overweight; the most significant effect being that of protein as a percentage of energy intake. The evidence for the impact of early weaning on adiposity levels, overweight and/ or obesity remains is inconsistent. Findings suggest that there is no relationship between adiposity and BMI in childhood with early weaning practices. However, the introduction of complementary foods before 16 wks was shown to lead to greater weight gain in early childhood (independent of other confounding factors), especially in those infants who are fed formula food or is only breastfed for less than 4 wks, which in turn could lead to overweight and obesity in later childhood. High protein intake (as percentage of energy) is strongly suggested to influence weight gain during infancy and BMI in early childhood...|$|E
40|$|Current {{guidelines}} {{recommend that}} infants are exclusively breast fed {{for the first}} 6 months of life, with particular solid foods being gradually introduced from 6 months. Our objective was to compare the growth of infants whose feeding most closely followed current guidelines {{with the growth of}} infants with other feeding practices. Participants were 1740 infants in a prospective cohort study in Southampton, UK. At 6 and 12 months, infants' milk feeding was recorded, diets assessed using food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), and anthropometry performed. Principal components analysis was used to identify patterns of foods in the diet using the food intakes assessed by the FFQs. Two patterns ('infant guidelines' and 'adult foods') explained most variance in infant diet at 6 and 12 months of age. The main outcomes were conditional growth in weight, length and skinfold thickness from 0 - 6 and 6 - 12 months. Infants who were breast fed from 0 - 6 months gained weight, length and adiposity more slowly than formula-fed infants, independent of <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>introduction</b> of solids and maternal factors: compared with infants who were breast fed from 0 - 6 months, formula-fed infants gained 0. 21 standard deviation scores (SDS) in weight [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 00, 0. 42]. Infants whose dietary pattern was most similar to current feeding guidelines, with high frequencies of fresh fruit and vegetables, home-prepared foods and breast milk, gained weight and skinfold thickness more rapidly from 6 to 12 months than other infants, independent of milk feeding, <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>introduction</b> of solids and maternal factors. Compared with infants in the lowest quarter, infants in the highest 'infant guidelines' score quarter gained 0. 24 SDS [95 % CI 0. 06, 0. 43] in weight and 0. 26 SDS [95 % CI 0. 07, 0. 45] in skinfold thickness. Conversely, infants whose diets had the highest frequencies of breads and processed foods gained weight less rapidly from 6 to 12 months than other infants. The extent to which the patterns of diet and growth we have described will influence the current or later health of infants is unknown. We are following up the infants in this study {{to assess the impact of}} these patterns beyond the first year of life. These associations should also be examined in other settings and populations...|$|E
40|$|Background: During {{the last}} several decades the {{prevalence}} of coeliac disease (CD) has increased worldwide. Aim: To compare the cumulative incidence of CD between Estonian and Finnish children and to identify the risk factors. Materials and methods: Children were recruited as part of the DIABIMMUNE Study. In the birth cohort (BC) 258 children from Estonia and 305 from Finland, and in the young children's cohort (YCC) 1363 and 1384 children were followed up, respectively. The diagnosis of CD was made in accordance with the ESPGHAN guidelines-the presence of IgA-tTG antibodies and small bowel villous atrophy. Results: During the study period 29 children developed CD. The cumulative incidence of CD was significantly higher in Finland (0. 77 % vs 0. 27 %; P = 0. 01). No difference was seen between the children with CD and the controls in the duration of breastfeeding or the <b>age</b> <b>at</b> cereal <b>introduction.</b> The BC children with CD had had significantly more episodes of infections with fever by the age of 12 months compared to the controls (3. 4 vs 1. 4; P = 0. 04). Conclusion: The 5 -year cumulative incidence of childhood CD is significantly higher in Finland than in Estonia. Sequential infections early in life may increase the risk for developing CD.

40|$|International audienceThe {{introduction}} of weaning foods {{is a major}} transition {{in the development of}} infants' eating behavior. Previous studies showed that greater variety {{at the beginning of the}} weaning period can later influence an infant's acceptance of new foods. The aim of the present study was to describe maternal feeding practices in the first year (breastfeeding duration, <b>age</b> <b>at</b> the initiation of weaning, variety of new foods introduced) and to study whether they impacted infants' later acceptance of new foods in a longitudinal survey of French children's eating behavior. Mothers (n = 203) were asked to record each food offered to their infants from the beginning of the weaning period to the age of 15 months and to score the acceptance of each food for the first 4 presentations. The foods were clustered into categories (i. e. fruits, vegetables...). The link between individual characteristics (maternal age, education level, parity, caregiver during weaning and infant gender) and exclusive breastfeeding duration, <b>age</b> <b>at</b> the initiation of weaning, <b>age</b> <b>at</b> the <b>introduction</b> of each food category, number of new foods introduced from all categories and the infant's acceptance of each food as studied. Finally, the link between feeding practices and infants' acceptance of new foods was analyzed. Seventy-two percent of the infants were exclusively breastfed from birth for a median duration of 68 days. On average, the <b>age</b> <b>at</b> the initiation of weaning, 5 months, was in accordance with the current French recommendations. The number of new foods introduced was 13. 4 per month on average and differed from one infant to another with no association with individual characteristics. The reactions to new foods were positive in 90 % of the cases but differed according to food categories. In the early weaning period, fruits and vegetables were the least positively accepted foods; however, the average acceptance rate of these foods reflects infants' positive reactions. The earlier vegetables were introduced, the higher the acceptance of new vegetables was. Finally, new food acceptance was significantly correlated with the number of different foods offered in the first two months of weaning, particularly for fruits and vegetables. These results highlight the ease of introducing new foods into a child's diet in the period between 4 and 15 months and the role of maternal complementary feeding practices on infants' acceptance of new foods...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: Methotrexate [MTX] is an immunomodulating {{drug that}} can be used to {{maintain}} remission in patients with Crohn's disease [CD], but data on efficacy and tolerability in children and teenagers are scarce. We evaluated the long-term efficacy and tolerability of MTX monotherapy after thiopurine therapy in paediatric CD patients. Methods: A multicenter cohort of paediatric MTX users who stopped thiopurines due to ineffectiveness or intolerance between 2002 and 2012 were included and followed for at least 12 months. Relapse-free use was defined as steroid and biologics-free clinical remission after the introduction of MTX, and included intentional discontinuation of successful therapy before the end of the observation period. Results: A total of 113 patients with CD in remission were followed while on MTX monotherapy, of whom 75 [66 %] had failed on thiopurines and 38 [34 %] had stopped thiopurines due to side effects. Median <b>age</b> <b>at</b> the <b>introduction</b> of MTX was 14 years [range 7 to 17], and 93 % used the subcutaneous route. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 52 % of the study cohort were still in steroid-and biologics-free remission after 12 months of MTX monotherapy, with a difference that did not reach significance between thiopurine-intolerant and thiopurine-failing patients [p = 0. 21, log-rank test]. Conclusions: The findings of this cohort study suggest that MTX is an effective immunomodulator to maintain remission after stopping thiopurines. MTX maintenance should be considered before stepping up to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy. MTX is probably somewhat more effective in patients who stopped thiopurines due to side effects than in those who failed on thiopurine...|$|R
40|$|To examine cigarette, alcohol, {{and drug}} use among {{undergraduates}} in Cork a precoded questionnaire was mailed to one in seven (458) students, chosen systematically. The response rate was 97 %. Twenty per cent of males and 36 % of females do not drink, whereas 52 % of males and 17 % of females are social drinkers or occasional drunks. Student patterns of drinking behaviour {{were significantly associated with}} sociocultural factors, such as leisure money available, belief in a God, and frequency of attendance at religious services. Current cigarette use, experience of marijuana, and attitude to future marijuana use, to the opposite sex drinking, and to the misdemeanour considered most serious also had significant associations with alcohol-related behaviour. It appears that peer group pressures, as illustrated by the proportion of close friends drinking and sibling drinking, have a greater influence on student drinking behaviour than family-related factors such as parental drinking and parental knowledge of drinking. The effect of ambivalent attitudes towards alcohol use, demonstrated by the <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>introduction</b> and the place of introduction to alcohol, may suggest that a more relaxed attitude to alcohol should be adopted...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{describe}} secular changes in body size in Shanghai infants, to compare the growth pattern between Shanghai children and Swedish children, and to explore the association of growth rate with parental body size, feeding practice and child health status. The study series consisted of 6, 018 longitudinally followed full-term children, born between 1 st January 1980 and 31 st December 1990 in Fenglin Community, Shanghai. The data clearly show a positive secular trend in growth in Shanghai over the decade of observation; at 12 months, the mean increase in weight and length were 0. 32 kg and 0. 64 cm, and at 24 months they were 0. 54 kg and 1. 29 cm.

40|$|Background: Performance in {{intelligence}} tests {{tends to be}} higher among individuals breastfed as infants, but {{little is known about}} the association between breastfeeding and achieved schooling. We assessed the association of infant feeding with school achievement in five cohorts from low- and middle-income countries. Unlike high-income country settings where most previous studies come from, breastfeeding is not positively associated with socioeconomic position in our cohorts, thus reducing the likelihood of a spurious positive association. Methodology and Principal Findings: Participants included 10, 082 young adults from five birth cohorts (Brazil, India, Guatemala, the Philippines, and South Africa). The exposures variables were whether the subject was ever breastfed, total duration of breastfeeding, and <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>introduction</b> of complementary foods. We adjusted the estimates for age at follow up, sex, maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, birthweight and socioeconomic position at birth. The key outcome was the highest grade achieved at school. In unadjusted analyses, the association between ever breastfeeding and schooling was positive in Brazil, inverse in the Philippines, and null in South Africa; in adjusted analyses, these associations were attenuated.

40|$|Infant dietary {{exposures}} {{have been}} linked to type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) development. IgG 4 antibody responses to food antigens are associated with food intolerances but have not been explored prospectively in the period preceding T 1 D. Using a case-cohort design, IgG 4 antibodies to ß-lactoglobulin, gluten, and ovalbumin were measured in plasma collected annually from 260 DAISY participants. Of those, 77 developed islet autoimmunity (IA), defined as positive for either insulin, GAD 65 or IA- 2 autoantibodies on two consecutive visits, and 22 developed T 1 D. In mixed model analysis adjusting for HLA-DR status, T 1 D family history, age and ethnicity, higher ß-lactoglobulin IgG 4 concentrations were associated with shorter breastfeeding duration (beta = - 0. 03, 95 % Confidence Interval: - 0. 05, - 0. 006) and earlier first cow's milk exposure (beta = - 0. 04, 95 % Confidence Interval: - 0. 08, 0. 00). Higher gluten IgG 4 was associated with older <b>age</b> <b>at</b> gluten <b>introduction</b> (beta =  0. 06, 95 % Confidence Interval: 0. 00, 0. 13). In proportional hazards analysis adjusting for HLA-DR status, T 1 D family history and ethnicity, IgG 4 against individual or multiple dietary antigens throughout childhood were not associated with IA. In addition, mean antigen-specific IgG 4 concentrations in infancy (age < 2 years) were not associated with risk of IA nor progression to T 1 D. Higher ovalbumin IgG 4 at first IA positive visit was marginally associated with progression to T 1 D (Hazard Ratio: 1. 39, 95 % Confidence Interval: 1. 00, 1. 92).

MethodsCross-sectional study of {{a representative sample of}} 817 preschool children, aged 2 – 4 years, attending municipal day care centers in the city of Taubaté. The weight and height of children were measured in the day care centers in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The body mass index z-score (BMIz) was calculated and children were classified as risk of overweight (BMIz≥ 1 to< 2) or excess weight (BMIz≥ 2). Data analysis was carried out by comparison of proportions, coefficient of correlation and multivariate linear regression. ResultsThe prevalence of risk of overweight was 18. 9 % and of excess weight (overweight or obesity) was 9. 3 %. The median duration of breastfeeding and age of introduction of non-breast milk was 6 months. The child's BMIz showed direct correlation with birth weight (r= 0. 154; p< 0. 001) and maternal body mass index (BMI) (r= 0. 113; p= 0. 002).

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present article was to summarize available evidence of the economic benefits and health risks {{associated with the use}} of automatic milk feeders (AMFs) in calves. Although AMFs are increasingly used in cattle production, clear evidence of their economic benefits (increased average daily gain, gradual weaning and reduced labor time) for the typical Belgian farm size and management is not available. Especially in smaller farms, where labor time is not a limiting factor, a careful economic consideration should be made. Regarding the association of AMFs with calf disease, studies have only been performed for bovine respiratory disease and confirmed an increased risk. However, since the use of AMFs is strongly related with several other risk factors (group housing at young age, large groups, age difference in a group, continuous system versus all-in/all-out), it is difficult to unequivocally identify the risk associated with AMFs alone. A group size of less than ten calves on a single drinking point, an all-in/alloutb grouping system and a minimum <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>introduction</b> to the automat of three weeks are recommended for farms with AMFs. To the authors’ knowledge, no scientific evidence supporting the presumed association of diarrhea and tongue ulcers with AMFs is available to date...|$|E
40|$|Background: Few {{children}} eat sufficient {{fruits and}} vegetables despite their established health benefits. The feeding practices used by parents when introducing novel foods to their children, and their efficacy, require further investigation. Objective: We aimed to establish which feeding strategies parents commonly use when introducing a novel fruit to their preschool-aged children and assess {{the effectiveness of these}} feeding strategies on children???s willingness to try a novel fruit. Design Correlational design. Participants/setting Twenty-five parents and their children aged 2 to 4 years attended our laboratory and consumed a standardized lunch, including a novel fruit. Interactions between parent and child were recorded and coded. Statistical analyses performed Pearson???s correlations and multiple linear regression analyses. Results: The frequency with which children swallowed and enjoyed the novel fruit, and the frequency of taste exposures to the novel fruit during the meal, were positively correlated with parental use of physical prompting and rewarding/bargaining. Earlier introduction of solids was related to higher frequency of child acceptance behaviors. The child???s <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>introduction</b> of solids and the number of physical prompts displayed by parents significantly predicted the frequency of swallowing and enjoying the novel fruit. Age of introduction to solids and parental use of rewards/bargaining significantly pre- dicted the frequency of taste exposures. Conclusions: Prompting a child to eat and using rewards or bargains during a positive mealtime interaction can help to overcome barriers to novel fruit consumption. Early introduction of solids is also associated with greater willingness to consume a novel fruit...|$|E
