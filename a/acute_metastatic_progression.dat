40|$|Most {{patients}} who die from cancer succumb to treatment-refractory advanced <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression.</b> Although {{the early stages}} of tumor metastasis result in the formation of clinically silent micrometastatic foci, its later stages primarily reflect the progressive, organ-destructive growth of already advanced metastases. Early-stage metastasis is regulated by multiple factors within tumor cells {{as well as by the}} tumor microenvironment (TME). In contrast, the molecular determinants that control advanced <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression</b> remain essentially uncharacterized, precluding the development of therapies targeted against it. Here we show that the TME, functioning in part through platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM- 1), drives advanced <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression</b> and is essential for progression through its preterminal end stage. PECAM- 1 –KO and chimeric mice revealed that its metastasis-promoting effects are mediated specifically through vascular endothelial cell (VEC) PECAM- 1. Anti–PECAM- 1 mAb therapy suppresses both end-stage <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression</b> and tumor-induced cachexia in tumor-bearing mice. It reduces proliferation, but not angiogenesis or apoptosis, within advanced tumor metastases. Because its antimetastatic effects are mediated by binding to VEC rather than to tumor cells, anti–PECAM- 1 mAb appears to act independently of tumor type. A modified 3 D coculture assay showed that anti–PECAM- 1 mAb inhibits the proliferation of PECAM- 1 –negative tumor cells by altering the concentrations of secreted factors. Our studies indicate that a complex interplay between elements of the TME and advanced tumor metastases directs end-stage <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression.</b> They also suggest that some therapeutic interventions may target late-stage metastases specifically. mAb-based targeting of PECAM- 1 represents a TME-targeted therapeutic approach that suppresses the end stages of <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression,</b> until now a refractory clinical entity...|$|R

40|$|Basal-like breast carcinomas (BLCs) {{present with}} extratumoral lymphovascular invasion, are highly metastatic, presumably through a hematogenous route, have {{augmented}} expression of CD 44 oncoprotein and relatively {{low levels of}} retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor. However, the causal relation among these features is not clear.

Secondly, Rb inhibits the release of single cancer cells and cell clusters into the hematogenous circulation and subsequent metastatic growth in lungs. Finally, CD 44 expression is required for collective motility and all subsequent stages of <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression</b> initiated by loss of Rb function. Altogether, our results suggest that Rb/CD 44 pathway is a crucial regulator of CCM and <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression</b> of BLCs and a promising target for anti-BLCs therapy...|$|R
40|$|Although metastatic {{colon cancer}} is {{a leading cause of}} cancer death worldwide, the {{molecular}} mechanisms that enable colon cancer cells to metastasize remain unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that metastatic cells develop by usurping transcriptional networks from embryonic stem (ES) cells to facilitate an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression.</b> Previous studies identified HMGA 1 as a key transcription factor enriched in ES cells, colon cancer, and other aggressive tumors, although its role in these settings is poorly understood. To determine how HMGA 1 functions in metastatic colon cancer, we manipulated HMGA 1 expression in transgenic mice and colon cancer cells. We discovered that HMGA 1 drives proliferative changes, aberrant crypt formation, and intestinal polyposis in transgenic mice. In colon cancer cell lines from poorly differentiated, metastatic tumors, knock-down of HMGA 1 blocks anchorage-independent cell growth, migration, invasion, xenograft tumorigenesis and three-dimensional colonosphere formation. Inhibiting HMGA 1 expression blocks tumorigenesis at limiting dilutions, consistent with depletion of tumor-initiator cells in the knock-down cells. Knock-down of HMGA 1 also inhibits <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression</b> to the liver in vivo. In metastatic colon cancer cells, HMGA 1 induces expression of Twist 1, a gene involved in embryogenesis, EMT, and tumor progression, while HMGA 1 represses E-cadherin, a gene that is down-regulated during EMT and <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression.</b> In addition, HMGA 1 is among the most enriched genes in colon cancer compared to normal mucosa. Our findings demonstrate {{for the first time that}} HMGA 1 drives proliferative changes and polyp formation in the intestines of transgenic mice and induces <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression</b> and stem-like properties in colon cancer cells.

40|$|Metastasis, or {{the spread}} of a primary tumor to distal sites in the body, is the major cause of human cancer-related {{morbidity}} and mortality. Metastasis requires a complex series of cellular events that remain poorly understood at the molecular level. Recently, advances in microarray technology have allowed cancer biologists to globally survey <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression</b> and define patterns of gene expression that correlate with <b>progression</b> to a <b>metastatic</b> phenotype. By using such a genomic approach, our laboratory identified a subset of genes that regulate the actin cytoskeleton whose enhanced expression correlates with metastasis. This thesis describes the characterization of IQGAP 1, a key regulator of the cytoskeleton, as a potentially critical player in <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression.</b> Here I show a strong positive correlation between IQGAP 1 expression levels and <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression</b> in both in vivo-selected human metastatic melanoma cells and other human tumors. In addition, I have experimentally analyzed the role of IQGAP 1 in metastasis using two different dominant-negative mutants.

We show that while hyperglycemia attenuates primary tumor growth, it concomitantly increases metastatic seeding in a distant organ. We further show that the increase in metastatic seeding is due to impaired secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and impaired neutrophil mobilization. Normalizing blood glucose levels using insulin rescues neutrophil recruitment and tumor growth and concomitantly reduces metastatic seeding.

40|$|PURPOSE: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) defined {{biochemical}} recurrence (BCR) {{of prostate}} cancer is widely used for reporting the outcome of radical prostatectomy (RP). A standardized BCR definition is lacking, and overall progression-free probability and risk of subsequent <b>metastatic</b> disease <b>progression</b> may vary greatly depending on the PSA criterion used. Ten definitions of BCR were evaluated to identify the one that best explains <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression.</b> METHODS: Of 3, 125 patients who underwent RP at our institution since 1985, 75 developed distant metastasis during a median follow-up of 49 months. To predict metastasis progression, we modeled the clinical information using multivariable Cox regression analysis. BCR {{was included in the}} model as a time-dependent covariate, and separate models were developed for each definition. A goodness-of-fit (R 2) statistic was used to determine the Cox model (and thereby the BCR definition) that best explained <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression.</b> RESULTS: The 10 -year progression-free probability ranged from 63 % to 79 %, depending on the BCR definition. The model containing BCR defined as a PSA of at least 0. 4 ng/mL followed by another increase best explained <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression</b> (R 2 = 0. 21). This definition was also associated with a high probability of subsequent secondary therapy, continued PSA progression, and rapid PSA doubling time. CONCLUSION: BCR defined as a PSA value of at least 0. 4 ng/mL followed by another increase best explains the development of distant metastasis among 10 candidate definitions, after controlling for clinical variables and the use of secondary therapy.

40|$|Wnt {{signalling}} has pivotal {{roles in}} tumour progression and metastasis; however, the exact molecular mechanism of Wnt signalling in the metastatic process {{is as yet}} poorly defined.

Importantly, restoring NDRG 1 expression by a small molecule compound significantly suppressed the capability of otherwise highly metastatic tumour cells to thrive in circulation and distant organs in animal models. In addition, our analysis of clinical cohorts data indicate that Wnt+/NDRG−/LRP+ signature has a strong predictable value for recurrence-free survival of cancer patients. Collectively, we have identified NDRG 1 as a novel negative master regulator of Wnt signalling during the <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression,</b> which opens an opportunity to define a potential therapeutic target for metastatic disease...|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} suggests that tumor cells metastasize by co-opting stem cell transcriptional networks, although the molecular underpinnings of this process are poorly understood.

Silencing HMGA 1 expression in invasive, aggressive breast cancer cells dramatically halts cell growth and results in striking morphologic changes from mesenchymal-like, spindle-shaped cells to cuboidal, epithelial-like cells. Mesenchymal genes (Vimentin, Snail) are repressed, while E-cadherin is induced in the knock-down cells.

Whether auto-Ab may be useful to track <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression</b> or response to treatment is, however, largely unknown. To address these issues, the serological proteome was analyzed in an invasive but treatmentresponsive mouse tumor model. Among 40 serum-reactive proteins identified by multiplex analysis, we chose to focus on glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP 78), a chaperone protein involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. We first validated GRP 78 as a protein overexpressed and mislocalized in tumor cells. We then documented that an increase in GRP 78 auto-Ab titer preceded the {{detection of}} a palpable tumor mass, correlated with <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression,</b> and was influenced by the onset of tumor neovascularization. We also found that chemotherapy and radiotherapy, both leading to inhibition of tumor growth, oppositely influenced the anti-GRP 78 immune response. Whereas radiation increased the concentration of GRP 78 auto-Ab by three-fold, the auto-Ab titer was reduced in response to bolus or metronomic administration of cyclophosphamide. Finally, we established a decrease in auto-Ab-producing B lymphocytes in response to chemotherapy and the overexpression of GRP 78 together with a strong immunoglobulin response in irradiated tumors. In conclusion, we identified GRP 78 auto-Ab as an early marker of tumor and <b>metastatic</b> <b>progressions.</b> However, the multiple influences of anticancer treatments on the humoral immune system calls for caution when exploiting such auto-Ab as markers of the tumor response...|$|R
40|$|<b>Metastatic</b> <b>progression,</b> {{including}} extravasation and micro-metastatic outgrowth, is {{the main}} cause of cancer patient death. Recent studies suggest that cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to support increased proliferation through increased glycolysis and biosynthetic activities, including lipogenesis pathways. However, metabolic changes during <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression,</b> including alterations in regulatory gene expression, remain undefined. We show that transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ 1) induced Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is accompanied by coordinately reduced enzyme expression required to convert glucose into fatty acids, and concomitant enhanced respiration. Over-expressed Snail 1, a transcription factor mediating TGFβ 1 -induced EMT, was sufficient to suppress carbohydrate-responsive-element-binding protein (ChREBP, a master lipogenic regulator), and fatty acid synthase (FASN), its effector lipogenic gene. Stable FASN knock-down was sufficient to induce EMT, stimulate migration and extravasation in vitro. FASN silencing enhanced lung metastasis and death in vivo.

40|$|Polyomavirus {{enhancer}} activator 3 protein (Pea 3), {{also known}} as ETV 4, {{is a member of}} the Ets-transcription factor family, which promotes <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression</b> in various types of solid cancer. Pea 3 -driven epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been described in lung and ovarian cancers. The mechanisms of Pea 3 -induced EMT, however, are largely unknown. Here we show that Pea 3 overexpression promotes EMT in human breast epithelial cells through transactivation of Snail (SNAI 1), an activator of EMT. Pea 3 binds to the human Snail promoter through the two proximal Pea 3 binding sites and enhances Snail expression. In addition, knockdown of Pea 3 in invasive breast cancer cells results in down-regulation of Snail, partial reversal of EMT, and reduced invasiveness in vitro. Moreover, knockdown of Snail partially rescues the phenotype induced by Pea 3 overexpression, suggesting that Snail is one of the mediators bridging Pea 3 and EMT, and thereby <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression</b> of the cancer cells. In four breast cancer patient cohorts whose microarray and survival data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, Pea 3 and Snail expression are significantly correlated with each other and with overall survival of breast cancer patients. We further demonstrate that nuclear localization of Pea 3 is associated with Snail expression in breast cancer cell lines and is an independent predictor of overall survival in a Chinese breast cancer patient cohort.

We report the results of an original study initiated in 2007, where cetuximab was tested with radiotherapy (RT) alone in locally advanced pancreatic cancer in a phase II trial (PACER). METHODS: Patients (n = 21) received cetuximab loading dose (400 mg/m 2) and weekly dose (250 mg/m 2) during RT (50. 4 Gy in 28 fractions). Toxicity and disease response end point data were prospectively assessed. A feasibility study of on-trial patient blood and skin sampling was incorporated. RESULTS: Treatment was well tolerated, toxicity was low; most patients (71 %) experienced acute toxicities of grade 2 or less. Six months posttreatment, stable local disease was achieved in 90 % of evaluable patients, but only 33 % were free from <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression.</b> Median overall survival was 7. 5 months, actuarial survival was 33 % at 1 year and 11 % at 3 years, reflecting swift <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression</b> in some patients but good long-term control of localized disease in others.

Silencing p 120 in ErbB 2 -dependent breast cancer cell lines dramatically inhibited migration and invasion as well as activation of Rac 1 and Cdc 42. In contrast, overexpression of constitutively active mutants of these GTPases reversed the effects of p 120 silencing. Lastly, ectopic expression of p 120 promoted migration and invasion and potentiated <b>metastatic</b> <b>progression</b> of a weakly metastatic, ErbB 2 -dependent breast cancer cell line.
