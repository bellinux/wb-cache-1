5|$|Dirge of Cerberus is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} third-person shooter.

Defeating enemies yields EXP, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of each stage, the player can either use that EXP to level up, increasing Vincent's stats, or convert it to Gil (the in-game currency), which can then be used to purchase items and equipment upgrades.|$|E
