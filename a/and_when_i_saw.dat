25|$|Now, Six {{of these}} works were {{illustrated}} entirely by me, and one-Windsor Castle-partly so, numbering altogether ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-FOUR {{of the very best}} designs and etchings which I have ever produced; and yet, in this Biographical Sketch, my name is not mentioned in any way as connected with these works-which omission, I thought, was not only very ungenerous, but also very unjust... And, when it was announced that Mr. Andrew Halliday had dramatized Ainsworth's 'Miser's Daughter,' I went to see the performance; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> represented on the stage scenes and characters which had emanated from me, I then publicly claimed to be the originator of that romance, and to have suggested the original idea and characters to Mr. Ainsworth.|$|E
500|$|Gillan {{was largely}} {{dissatisfied}} with his brief stint in Sabbath, notably the final mix of Born Again (though {{he liked the}} songs and their original mixes), and its cover, which featured a demonic-looking baby. He was quoted in Kerrang! in 1984 as saying, [...] "I looked at the cover and puked." [...] In an interview supporting Deep Purple's reformation in 1984, he stated of Born Again, [...] "They had sent me a box of records. <b>And,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the cover, and heard the mix, I smashed {{every single one of}} them to pieces." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, {{while working}} on several films, A. R. Rahman {{received}} an email from Danny Boyle, {{the director of the}} film Slumdog Millionaire, stating: [...] "Hey I'm Danny Boyle, I like your work, and it would be great for us to have you on our film". Rahman was unsure how to answer, but after exchanging several more emails, they met in Mumbai. Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying [...] "when I talked to him, I had some interest and I wanted to see the film. He had a first cut of the film already, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that I was really interested and wanted to do it. So I left another film to do this one. I made time for it".|$|E

500|$|Winehouse's {{greatest}} {{love was}} 1960s girl groups. Her stylist, Alex Foden, borrowed her [...] "instantly recognisable" [...] beehive hairdo (a weave) and she borrowed her Cleopatra makeup from The Ronettes. Her imitation was so successful, as The Village Voice reports: [...] "Ronnie Spector—who, {{it could be}} argued, all but invented Winehouse's style {{in the first place}} when she took the stage at the Brooklyn Fox Theater with her fellow Ronettes more than 40 years ago—was so taken aback at a picture of Winehouse in the New York Post that she exclaimed, [...] "I don't know her, I never met her, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that pic, I thought, 'That's me!' But then I found out, no, it's Amy! I didn't have on my glasses." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him move, I was mesmerized. I {{had never seen a}} performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do {{for the rest of my}} life because of James Brown." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 2011, Cooder was {{inspired}} to write the song [...] "No Banker Left Behind", and subsequently {{the rest of the}} album, by a headline about bankers and other affluent people who had profited from the bank bailouts and resulting recession during the late-2000s. In an interview with Kai Ryssdal on Marketplace, Cooder cited the song as the starting point for writing the album and stated, [...] "'No Banker Left Behind' originated with a line from Robert Scheer's Truthdig blog. I read this pretty regularly, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> this, this metric I thought 'no banker left behind.'" [...] He compared the album's content to Woody Guthrie's songs about the Dust Bowl era during the Great Depression and said of his own songs, [...] "What I like in the idea of these songs is if you follow the logic of each tune — this happened and this happened {{and you can see that}} at the end, this is the result, you just didn't see it this way before, you never thought of Wall Street in terms of Jesse James and bilingual heft." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} of Harrison's 1987 album Cloud Nine, for Creem magazine, Bill Holdship {{included}} the track among the [...] "scattered brilliant moments" [...] of Harrison's career post-All Things Must Pass, saying: [...] "'You' from the Extra Texture LP sounds like punk (depends on your definition) pop as Phil Spector might've done it, and remains a killer to this day. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Harrison perform in 1974, {{he put on a}} far better show than the one I would later see Wings do." [...] Writing in the posthumous Rolling Stone Press tribute, Harrison, in 2002, Mikal Gilmore similarly identified [...] "You" [...] as a highlight of the artist's work in the mid to late 1970s. In the same publication, Greg Kot deemed it to be [...] "a terrific single", adding: [...] "Its roaring Wall of Sound arrangement suits Harrison well, right down to its closing quote of the Ronettes' 'Be My Baby'." [...] In a January 2002 review of Harrison's solo releases, for Goldmine magazine, Dave Thompson described the song as [...] "magnificent".|$|E
500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] {{marked the}} first episode in its new time slot on Thursdays at 10 p.m., occupying a period {{previously}} filled by L.A. Law. The show previously aired 9 p.m. on Wednesdays, where it was regularly defeated in the ratings by the ABC comedy Home Improvement. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by Fontana. It was directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, a feature director then-best known for such films as Waterland (1992) and A Dangerous Woman (1993). It was the first television script written by Mills, who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with Simon while studying journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. Mills said of [...] "Bop Gun", [...] "That script inspired me to quit journalism. It was a golden opportunity, even though I didn't know what I was doing. I developed bad habits as a newspaper feature writer. I would always stretch a project to fill the available time." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] served as a departure from previous Homicide: Life on the Street episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim, {{rather than on the}} detectives. Simon felt the script's dialogue, particularly the detectives' use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the homicide unit, were faithful to reality. He particularly cited the scene in which Felton angers Ellison by talking excitedly about how much overtime he expected to get. Simon said, [...] "That's a conversation that would happen. It would happen in any homicide unit in America, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it actually being acted out I got a real kick in the pants because I thought, 'Wherever there are homicide detectives watching this, they're cracking up because they know how true it is.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|AXS writer Terrance Pryor {{considers}} What to Do When You Are Dead {{a concept}} album [...] "based around the main character's suicide and his {{journey through the}} afterlife". Some observers have noted the character going through the Kübler-Ross 5-stage model of grief management. Jorgensen {{grew up in a}} [...] "very scientific environment," [...] which caused him to be influenced by British writer Craig Hamilton-Parker. The album's title comes from a Hamilton-Parker book. Jorgensen explained that since he was [...] "already writing an album in that way, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that book, I thought, 'It would be really cool to make a whole album out of this." [...] Jorgensen later remarked that placing himself in that perspective helped him [...] "face a lot of things I probably would've been too much of a wuss to face, if I didn't pretend I wasn't alive". The band were initially hesitant working on a concept album until they were persuaded by Jorgensen.|$|E

2500|$|Portman was {{a unique}} choice because she was {{unfamiliar}} with Star Wars. [...] "My cousins had always been obsessed with the films, yet I hadn't even seen them before I got the part," [...] she says. [...] "When it all happened for me, my cousins were exclaiming, 'Oh, my God, you're in Star Wars!'" [...] She told a CNN interviewer, [...] "I really wasn't aware of how big a deal Star Wars was ... <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the films, I really liked them, but I still didn't really understand how many ... were passionate fans of this film." [...] Portman was, however, enthusiastic over being cast as the queen of Naboo, a character she expected to become a role model: [...] "It was wonderful playing a young queen with so much power. I {{think it will be}} good for young women to see a strong woman of action who is also smart and a leader." ...|$|E
