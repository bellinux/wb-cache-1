40|$|This paper uses panel econometric {{techniques}} to estimate a macro-financial model for fee <b>and</b> <b>commission</b> income over total assets {{for a broad}} sample of euro area banks. Using the estimated parameters, it conducts a scenario analysis projecting the fee <b>and</b> <b>commission</b> income ratio over a three years horizon conditional on the baseline and adverse macroeconomic scenarios used in the 2016 EU-wide stress test. The {{results indicate that the}} fee <b>and</b> <b>commission</b> income ratio is varying in particular with changes in its own lag, the shortterm interest rate, stock market returns and real GDP growth. They also show that the fee <b>and</b> <b>commission</b> income ratio projections are more conservative under the adverse scenario than under the baseline scenario. These findings suggest that stress tests assuming scenario-independent fee <b>and</b> <b>commission</b> income projections are likely to be awed...|$|R

5|$|A council-manager {{government}} {{has been in place}} in Norman since the adoption of its city charter on , 1919. A councilor from each of the city's eight council wards is elected to office every two years, each serving a term of two years. Councilors are elected from their own respective wards based on a plurality voting system; a councilor from each ward serves on the Norman City Council. A mayor is elected by the entire voting population of Norman and serves as an at-large councilor; the mayor serves for a term of three years. As a whole, the council acts as the legislative body of city government; it aims to pass laws, approve the city budget, and manage efficiency in the government. The City Council appoints a professional City Manager who is responsible for the day-to-day administrative activities of the city. The City of Norman has approximately 650 employees working in eleven departments and 31 boards <b>and</b> <b>commissions</b> that help oversee and implement the policies and services of the city. The City Council meets bi-weekly in City Hall located at 201 W. Gray Street in downtown Norman; various boards <b>and</b> <b>commissions</b> meet in accordance with their own schedules. The present mayor of Norman is Lynne Miller (elected in 2016), and the city manager is Steve Lewis (appointed in 2007). In accordance with the charter of the city of Norman, all city elected positions are nonpartisan.|$|E

5|$|By 1934, the {{executive}} branch consisted of sixty-nine boards, commissions, and agencies {{in addition to the}} constitutional officers, although the members of these commissions were often the constitutional officers themselves.

5|$|Roark's modernist {{approach}} to architecture is contrasted {{with that of}} most of the other architects in the novel. In the opening chapter, the dean of his architecture school tells Roark that the best architecture must copy the past rather than innovate or improve. Roark repeatedly loses jobs with architectural firms <b>and</b> <b>commissions</b> from clients because he is unwilling to copy conventional architectural styles. In contrast, Keating's mimicry of convention brings him top honors in school and an immediate job offer. The same conflict between innovation and tradition is reflected in the career of Roark's mentor, Henry Cameron.|$|E

Three of these institutions were transferred to the United Nations after the Second World War: the International Labour Organisation, the Permanent Court of International Justice (as the International Court of Justice), and the Health Organisation (restructured as the World Health Organisation).|$|E

This list {{is drawn from}} alumni of the Military Academy who are engineers. Most of the U.S. Army's Chiefs of Engineers were Academy alumni; beginning with Joseph Gardner Swift (class of 1802) and most recently the current Chief of Engineers, Robert L. Van Antwerp, Jr. (class of 1972). Other notable engineers include Orlando Metcalfe Poe (class of 1856), a lighthouse engineer, and George Washington Goethals (class of 1880), chief engineer of the Panama Canal.|$|E
5|$|Acting on {{recommendations}} from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost {{revenue from the}} sales tax by raising excise taxes; of particular import was the tax on whiskey, which {{was made possible by}} the repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government, reducing the number of boards <b>and</b> <b>commissions</b> in the executive branch from 133 to 22. Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more {{power in the hands of}} the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{was taken}} on {{as a member}} of the BBC Wales children's {{department}} in 1985 and given one-day contracts <b>and</b> <b>commissions,</b> such as illustrating for Why Don't You? As he was only given three days of work per month by the BBC, he continued to freelance and volunteer for the Sherman Theatre. In 1986, he was approached by the Sunday Sport before its launch to provide a football-themed daily strip; he declined because he was concerned about the pornographic content of the newspaper. He submitted a script for Crossroads in response to an appeal for new writers; it was not used because the show was cancelled in 1987. He ultimately abandoned his graphic art career entirely when he realised in his early twenties that he enjoyed writing the dialogue of a comic more than creating the art.|$|E

5|$|The European {{demand for}} {{agricultural}} products and industrial commodities stipulated maritime activity and international trade to an unprecedented extent. The Ayyubids {{played a leading role}} in this as they controlled sea-trade routes which passed through the ports of Yemen and Egypt via the Red Sea. The trade policy of the Ayyubids placed them in a position of great advantage; although they cooperated with the Genoans and Venetians in the Mediterranean Sea, they prevented them from having access to the Red Sea. Thus, they kept the trade of the Indian Ocean exclusively in their hands. In the Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids drew large benefits in the form of taxes <b>and</b> <b>commissions</b> which they learned from the Italians.|$|E
5|$|The Governor {{appoints}} {{almost all}} military and civil {{officers of the}} State government, subject to advice and consent of the Maryland State Senate. The Governor also appoints certain boards <b>and</b> <b>commissions</b> {{in each of the}} 24 Counties and in Baltimore City, such as local Boards of Elections, commissions notaries public, and appoints officers to fill vacancies in the elected offices of Attorney General and Comptroller. Should a vacancy arise in either of the two houses of the General Assembly, the Governor also fills that vacancy, though the Governor must choose from among the recommendations of the local party organization to which the person leaving the vacancy belonged. Any officer appointed by the Governor, except a member of the General Assembly, is removable by him or her, if there is a legitimate cause for removal. Among the most prominent of the Governor's appointees are the 24 secretaries and heads of departments that currently make up the Governor's Cabinet, also known as the Executive Council.|$|E

The vicar does not like Squire Thornhill, who is reputed to be a degenerate young man, but he has no reservations once he sees Thornhill's interest in his daughter, Olivia.
