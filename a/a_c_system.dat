50|$|The early makers {{including}} Eichhorn (Schwyz) and Nussbaumer (Bachenbülach) {{experimented with}} different arrangements {{and numbers of}} buttons. The typical Schwyzerörgeli today has 18 bass buttons arranged in two rows (one for bass notes and one for major chords), and 31 treble buttons on the RH arranged in 3 rows with a fingering similar to the 'club' system. The basses progress in 4ths like the Stradella system seen on chromatic and piano accordions, but in the opposite direction. Some Schwyzerörgelis have fewer buttons in the upper/inside row on the RH much like the club models, or more buttons - sometimes an extra row on the outside - and fewer or more basses. Since Swiss music rarely uses minor chords, even Örgelis with 4 bass rows usually have no minor chords but majors and 7ths instead. The only other variety still being made in substantial numbers today is the Schwyzerörgeli with chromatic fingering - usually with <b>a</b> <b>C</b> <b>system</b> (C-Griff) treble side and Stradella bass fingering.|$|E

Methods. A retrospective study was performed. The V. <b>A.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>system</b> (Kinetic Concepts Inc., San Antonio, TX) was used at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics for management of com-plicated head and neck wounds. Results. The V. <b>A.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>system</b> was utilized at 13 sites for 12 patients.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the algorithms developed for synthesizing frequency matched <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>system</b> equivalents {{for use with}} a Transient Convertor Simulator program. Two synthesis methods are outlined, with the merits of each being illustrated by applying them to the lower South Island portion of New Zealand's primary transmission system. Validation of the diakoptical technique used to model the frequency dependent mutual coupling, as well as data preparation, is achieved by using the current source model to inject harmonic currents into the frequency-matched <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>system</b> equivalent.

In order to provide a net contribution to this issue a detailed wind park model has been developed and is briefly presented. However, the computational costs associated with the performance of such a detailed model in describing the behavior of a wind park composed by a considerable number of units may render its practical application very difficult. To overcome this problem integral manifolds theory has been applied to reduce the order of the detailed wind park model, and therefore create the conditions {{for the development of a}} dynamic equivalent which is able to retain the relevant dynamics with respect to the existing <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper integral manifold method has been introduced for order reduction.

On the day of admission, irrigation and debridement of the open wound, and temporary fixation of the radius and ulna using an external fixator and a Kirschner wire were peformed. Six days after the surgery, we used negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) using the V. <b>A.</b> <b>C.</b> ATS® <b>system</b> for the open wound. Thirteen days after the first surgery, definitive fixation was performed by using locking compression plates, and full thickness skin grafting was undertaken for the open wound.

In our case, we could reduce the healing period of the soft tissue and could convert to the definitive fixation in a timely fashion.

It is demonstrated that the three phase fast decoupled load flow displays all the characteristics of the original single phase version. Single phase balanced convertor modelling is reviewed and several techniques for the integration of such models with the single phase fast decoupled load flow are developed and their performance is compared. The methods for single phase convertor modelling are extended to allow unbalanced convertor operation to be analysed. The integration of the unbalanced convertor model into the three phase fast decoupled load flow is described. Convergence properties are examined and detailed results given.

METHODS: A total of 162 diabetic patients with post-amputation wounds (up to the trans-metatarsal level) entered a 16 -week, randomized clinical trial. Patients randomized to V. A. C. (n = 77) received therapy with dressing changes every 48 hours. Control patients (n = 85) received standard MWT. Resource utilization, procedures, and direct costs were calculated and analyzed in this post hoc retrospective study. RESULTS: There {{was no difference between}} groups for in-patient hospital stay (number of admissions or length of stay). More surgical procedures (including debridement) were required in the MWT group (120 vs 43 NPWT, P <. 001). The average number of dressing changes performed per patient was 118. 0 (range 12 - 226) for MWT versus 41 (6 - 140) for NPWT (P =. 0001). The MWT group had 11 (range 0 - 106) outpatient treatment visits during the study versus 4 (range 0 - 47) in the NPWT group (P <. 05). The average direct cost per patient treated for 8 weeks or longer (independent of clinical outcome) was $ 27, 270 and $ 36, 096 in the NPWT and MWT groups, respectively.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Enteroatmospheric fistula (EAF) is one severe {{complication}} of laparotomy. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) {{has been successfully}} employed to manage numerous wounds, but probably contraindicated in an open abdomen (OA) wound due to its risks of increasing EAF incidence. This case report aims to explore {{the possibility of using}} NPWT to manage EAF in a patient with OA. Case Description: Mrs. A. was a 42 year old patient admitted to Lovelace Women’s Hospital, Albuquerque, New Mexico, on 12 / 19 / 2014 for robot-assisted laparoscopic vaginal hysterectomy. On 12 / 22 / 2014, the patient underwent midline laparotomy for bowel resection, drainage of fecal peritonitis, cleanse of contaminated abdominal cavity and removal of abdominal wall mesh due to bowel perforation secondary to prior surgery. On 1 / 6 / 2015, the patient underwent the 3 rd surgery for bowel resection and drainage of abscess due to EAF formed through dehiscence of the prior anastomosis. Commercial NPWT kit V. A. C. (KCI, San Antonio, TX) was used by the physical therapist to manage the OA after the 2 nd and 3 rd surgery. The patient was discharged for home health on 1 / 16 / 2015 with a portable V. <b>A.</b> <b>C</b> <b>system.</b> Outcomes: The patient met the short term goals including development of healthy granulation tissues, shrinkage of the wound, and no occurrence of future complications. Discussion: Available evidences partially disapproved the caution of increasing EAF incidence by NPWT and supported advantages of NPWT in OA management, including decrease of mortality, increase of fascial closure, and healing of EAFs and enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) or transformation of EAFs to ECFs.

A recently conducted survey reveals that the integration of flexible <b>A.</b> <b>C.</b> transmission <b>system</b> (FACTS) devices into conventional three-phase transmission system for enhancement and control of power flow is well established, however, this aspect has not been investigated for multi-phase power transmission systems.

An additional challenge is the need to exchange target-rich tactical picture information. A systems engineering approach was used to identify the critical factors necessary in <b>a</b> <b>C</b> 2 <b>system</b> to be architected to satisfy the needs for <b>a</b> future <b>C</b> 2 <b>system</b> able to achieve and maintain interoperability in a target rich environment. A pilot study was conducted using ExtendSim to model growing networks and injection of increased amounts of data to assess their impact on the timeliness of information received by the system nodes. Potential future work on the pilot study was described. Civilian, Defence Science & Technology Agency, Singapor...|$|R
40|$|Interoperability is a {{critical}} issue for DoD <b>C</b> 2 <b>systems.</b> Current research has mostly focused on the data interoperability and ontology of context. While these studies are important and useful, they have not addressed other important issues on semantic interoperability and its verification & validation. This paper proposes a new technique called use scenario, which specifies the workflow of passing parameters among different services or the semantics of interoperation. For <b>a</b> <b>C</b> 2 <b>system,</b> once the use scenario is specified, a family of automated analysis, verification, and validation techniques is available for testing and evaluating the system and its interoperability...|$|R
