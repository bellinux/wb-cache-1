25|$|In 2002, Murakami {{published}} the anthology Birthday Stories, which collects short {{stories on the}} theme of birthdays. The collection includes work by Russell Banks, Ethan Canin, Raymond Carver, David Foster Wallace, Denis Johnson, Claire Keegan, Andrea Lee, Daniel Lyons, Lynda Sexson, Paul Theroux, and William Trevor, as well as a story by Murakami himself. What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, containing tales about his experience as a marathon runner and a triathlete, was published in Japan in 2007, with English translations released in the U.K. and the U.S. in 2008. The title is a play on that of Raymond Carver's short story collection, What We Talk <b>About</b> <b>When</b> <b>We</b> Talk About Love.|$|E
500|$|During a September 2009 {{earnings}} call, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick {{was asked}} about Grand Theft Auto V, the purported next game in the series. He replied, [...] "We're not going to announce it, we're not going to announce when {{we are going to}} announce it, and {{we are not going to}} announce a strategy about announcing it or <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are going to announce it either, or about the announcement strategy surrounding the announcement of the strategy".|$|E

500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E
2500|$|Riggan Thomson is a faded American {{actor who}} {{is famous for}} playing the superhero Birdman in a film trilogy 20 years ago. He is tormented by the mocking and {{critical}} internal voice of Birdman and is frequently shown performing feats of levitation and telekinesis. Riggan is trying to gain recognition as a serious actor for writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story [...] "What We Talk <b>About</b> <b>When</b> <b>We</b> Talk About Love." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{wrote to}} the club just over a week ago and their solicitors {{acknowledged}} that letter. We have so far had no response though <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> can all have a face-to-face meeting. We propose a meeting to discuss all the issues, because it just seems the sensible thing to do. To be honest I am not surprised by anything they do anymore. They can say all the threats and deadlines they want but we won’t {{come to an end}} of the matter until they {{sit down and talk to}} us." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 30 October 2009, May wrote a fanclub {{letter on}} his website stating that Queen had no {{intentions}} to tour in 2010 {{but that there}} was a possibility of a performance. He was quoted as saying, [...] "The greatest debate, though, is always <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> will next play together as Queen. At the moment, in spite of the many rumours that are out there, we do not have plans to tour in 2010. The good news, though, is that Roger and I have a much closer mutual understanding these days—privately and professionally ... and all ideas are carefully considered. Music is never far away from us. As I write, there is an important one-off performance on offer, in the USA, and it remains to be decided whether we will take up this particular challenge. Every day, doors seem to open, and every day, we interact, perhaps more than ever before, with the world outside. It is a time of exciting transition in Rock music and in 'The Business'. It's good that the pulse still beats". On 15 November 2009, May and Taylor performed [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] live on the British TV show The X Factor alongside the finalists.|$|E
2500|$|The {{personal}} and vocational {{experiences of the}} four co-writers were central to writing the script. Dinelaris' exposure to Broadway shaped the depictions of rehearsals and events backstage, though he admitted exaggerating these. He also felt his background writing long scenes of dialogue helped since scenes in the film [...] "were really more like play scenes". Iñárritu's own experiences influenced many of Birdmans themes. [...] "What this film talks about, I have been through," [...] Iñárritu recalled. [...] "I have seen and experienced all of it; it's what I have been living through {{the last years of}} my life." [...] Dinelaris described this aspect as [...] "a laughing look at oneself", but said {{it had to be done}} in a comedic way otherwise [...] "it would have been the most unbelievably self-absorbed look at the subject". Themes from Raymond Carver's short story [...] "What We Talk <b>About</b> <b>When</b> <b>We</b> Talk About Love", which Riggan adapts for stage in the story, also influenced the script. Iñárritu wanted to find the connection between the themes in Riggan's story and those of Carver's. Because of this, it was important to the director that Carver's story be the subject of the play depicted within the film. Therefore, Iñárritu stated that his desire to use Carver's work was [...] "terrifying" [...] because the rights to using the Carver material were still subject to the possibility of being rejected during development of the film, but no issues arose. Carver's widow, writer Tess Gallagher, loved the script and permitted the adaptation, saying that Carver would be laughing about the film.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, Silas takes a dislike to Riley's fiancé, Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), {{after he}} learns of her promiscuity. Silas {{attempts}} and fails to attack Mercedes with a candlestick when her back is turned. Metcalfe later hinted that Mercedes {{may have to}} watch her back in the future {{when it comes to}} Silas. She said [...] " [...] is a tough cookie, isn't he? I think every girl in the village needs to watch their back where Silas is concerned..." [...] In October 2011, it was reported that Silas would hold Mercedes captive in a vault. Silas decides to teach heavily pregnant Mercedes a lesson after she confesses to an affair with Riley's father, Carl Costello (Paul Opacic). Silas's plan is to keep Mercedes alive until she has given birth and then murder her. Metcalfe called the plot [...] "brilliant" [...] and said it was [...] "quite flattering" [...] to be trusted with it. The actress explained that Mercedes thinks that she is going to die whilst being help captive. Mercedes also fears that her baby is going to die. Metcalfe said that it does not take long for Mercedes to realise that Silas is responsible for the recent murders. Silas wants to keep the baby alive, but not Mercedes. Therefore, Silas does the [...] "bare minimum" [...] for Mercedes, giving her water, a small amount of food and keeping her warm. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy opined that storyline sounds [...] "really dark" [...] and asked Metcalfe whether Hollyoaks are pushing the boundaries with it. Metcalfe revealed that [...] "they are a little bit", saying [...] "It's all shot in a very clever way, so it was fine when it came to compliance. But it was difficult {{and there was a lot}} of stuff that we had to be really careful <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were filming it." [...] Metcalfe would not reveal whether Mercedes survives her encounter with Silas.|$|E

6000|$|... 'But, Ronald,' Lady Le Breton continued, half angrily, 'consider his unbelief, his dreadful opinions, his {{errors of}} doctrine! How on earth {{can we be}} happy <b>about</b> him <b>when</b> <b>we</b> think of those?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I cannot {{swear that}} I am right; but, if sailing {{on the wrong}} tack, we can only go <b>about,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> find out the mistake. As to means, I confess they are easier named than mustered." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He {{never would}} leave me. He {{absolutely}} drove {{me out of}} the country because he would follow me <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were hunting. He insulted me so grievously that I had to turn tail and run away from him. What did he want of me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mine will be scared; she's always afraid I'm {{going to}} get hurt, so I'm careful. But I guess I'll risk it, and have some fun to tell <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> go home," [...] said Billy, trudging after Captain Tommy, who always took the lead.|$|E
6000|$|... "’It’s a {{wonderful}} animal,’ ses the skipper, ’an’ there’s {{none of you}} now but has seen the sea-sarpint; but I forbid any man here {{to say a word}} <b>about</b> it <b>when</b> <b>we</b> get ashore.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not just yet. We shall {{take the}} train south to Santa Fe, and perhaps to Albuquerque. I'll talk to Wampus <b>about</b> that. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> reach a good climate we'll begin the journey overland--and not before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So he did," [...] said Cap'n Bill. [...] "We {{must ask}} him <b>about</b> that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> see him. But I guess the ol' boy's mem'ry is failin', an' he can't be {{depended}} on for pertic'lars." ...|$|R
