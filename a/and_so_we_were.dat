500|$|The ANAK Society {{explained}} {{its name}} as originating from {{a passage in}} the Book of Numbers, one of the books of the Hebrew Bible. The passage, attributed to , reads, [...] "And there were the Nephilin, the sons of ANAK, who came of the giants: {{and we were in}} our own sight as grasshoppers, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in their sight." [...] Anak was a biblical figure said to be the forefather of the Nephilim, a race of giants. For unknown reasons, the society's name has sustained minor alterations over the years, from Anak in the 1908 Blue Print, the first edition of Georgia Tech's yearbook, to ANAK in recent editions of The Technique, Georgia Tech's student newspaper.|$|E

According to Keane, Petraeus was shot [...] "accidentally, {{standing}} right next to me, and I had to fight to save his life. He had a hole {{about the size of}} a quarter in his back and is gushing with blood, and we stopped the bleeding and got him on a helicopter and got him to a surgeon <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> sort of bonded ever since that time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a December 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy spoke about writing this episode with guest star Ian McShane in mind, [...] "Christmas and American Horror Story {{do not go}} together <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{trying to figure out}} 'What's our version of Christmas?' And the answer of course is a homicidal Santa. There's a whole subgenre in horror dedicated to these psycho Santas. It's a thing. So we decided let's write somebody who's so crazy they end up in Briarcliff. I had heard Ian McShane really loved American Horror Story. So we wrote it and we were like, 'Let's send it to him and ask for a quick pass.' To my delight, he said yes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Derrick May {{identified}} {{the influence of}} Kraftwerk and other European synthesizer music in commenting that [...] "it was just classy and clean, and to us it was beautiful, like outer space. Living around Detroit, there was so little beauty... everything is an ugly mess in Detroit, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> attracted to this music. It, like, ignited our imagination!". May has commented that he considered his music a direct continuation of the European synthesizer tradition. He also identified Japanese synthpop act Yellow Magic Orchestra, particularly member Ryuichi Sakamoto, and British band Ultravox, as influences, along with Kraftwerk. YMO's song [...] "Technopolis" [...] (1979), a tribute to Tokyo as an electronic mecca, is considered an [...] "interesting contribution" [...] {{to the development of}} Detroit techno, foreshadowing concepts that Atkins and Davis would later explore with Cybotron.|$|E
2500|$|He said, [...] "In {{the early}} days, {{every time you}} saw the {{exterior}} of Hogwarts, it was a physical miniature," [...] which was made by craftsmen and occupied a large sound stage. [...] "We {{ended up with a}} profile of how Hogwarts looked, a skyline that actually I didn't design, and it wasn't always satisfactory, and as all the novels got written and movies got made there were new requirements [...] The [...] definitely wasn't there originally, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to add that substantial piece. And in the last film, we needed an arena for the battle for Hogwarts – the big courtyard outside doubled in size, {{and if you look at}} the first movie it wasn't there at all. There were quite some liberties taken with the continuity of Hogwarts." [...] In the last film, Craig used a digital model instead of a miniature to [...] "embrace the latest technology".|$|E

50|$|Traffic on the Seine {{entered into}} {{consciousness}} {{in a different}} way too—the Pre-Impressionist and impressionist painters would paint the Riverscenes from the Pont Neuf, to Argenteuil. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> left withcolourful <b>and</b> sometimes cubist, copies of age old scenes.|$|R
60|$|The dead {{who speak}} to us deny metempsychosis, perhaps because they but know a little better what they knew alive; while the dead in Asia, for perhaps no better reason, affirm it, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> left amid plausibilities and uncertainties.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "circle of death" [...] {{comes from}} the fact that when the {{head-to-head}} records <b>are</b> compared, <b>we</b> find that A has beaten B, B has beaten C, and C has beaten A, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> back where <b>we</b> started.|$|R

60|$|We distressed {{ourselves}} {{very little}} about the astonishing echo the guide talked so much about.

6000|$|WALTER MAP. --Well, {{there were}} Abbots--but {{they did not}} bring their women; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> dull enough at first, {{but in the end}} we flourished out into a merriment; for the old King would act {{servitor}} and hand a dish to his son; whereupon my Lord of York--his fine-cut face bowing and beaming with all that courtesy which hath less loyalty in it than the backward scrape of the clown's heel--'great honour,' says he, 'from the King's self to the King's son.' Did you hear the young King's quip? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, it is some trouble; and then, {{though it}} is cheap, it is cheaper not to have any; and, on the whole, the {{children}} are quite as well contented without it, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> fallen into the way of not having any." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, you know," [...] he began, [...] "we {{have neither}} city nor country in your sense, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> neither <b>so</b> {{isolated}} nor so crowded together.

6000|$|... "I {{suppose that}} would be so, master," [...] Paolo said thoughtfully; [...] "so I {{think that it would}} be best for me that the king should not take it into his head to give me that estate. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to Geneva, master?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, we {{were not}} alone, aunts," [...] Lucy said; [...] "the Confederate officer and his servant were coming through and, of course, they took care of us. We could never have got through alone, and as Chloe was with me, we got on very nicely; but we have {{been a long time}} getting through, for in the fight, where he saved my life and killed five of the band, he had his {{shoulder}} broken by a pistol bullet, and we had to stop in a farmhouse near Mount Pleasant, and he was very ill for some time, but the doctor who attended him was a true Southerner, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> quite safe till he was able to move again." ...|$|E
60|$|The gale {{had blown}} itself out next day, {{but it was}} a bitter morning when we started upon our journey. We saw the cold winter sun rise over the dreary marshes of the Thames and the long, sullen reaches of the river, which I shall ever {{associate}} with our pursuit of the Andaman Islander in the earlier days of our career. After a long and weary journey, we alighted at a small station some miles from Chatham. While a horse was being put into a trap at the local inn, we snatched a hurried breakfast, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all ready for business when we at last arrived at Yoxley Old Place. A constable met us at the garden gate.|$|E
60|$|Down to {{the main}} floor we {{encountered}} many Mahars, Sagoths, and slaves; but no {{attention was paid to}} us as we had {{become a part of the}} domestic life of the building. There was but a single entrance leading from the place into the avenue and this was well guarded by Sagoths--this doorway alone were we forbidden to pass. It is true that we were not supposed to enter the deeper corridors and apartments except on special occasions when we were instructed to do so; but as we were considered a lower order without intelligence there was little reason to fear that we could accomplish any harm by so doing, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not hindered as we entered the corridor which led below.|$|E

5000|$|These {{really are}} the same operator, {{in the sense that}} they agree on the {{subspace}} [...] Since the intersection contains simple functions, it is dense in both [...] and [...] Densely defined continuous operators admit unique extensions, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> justified in considering [...] and [...] to be the same.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, poor Miss Mowbray," [...] said Lady Penelope, {{lowering}} her voice, {{and shaking}} her head; [...] "she has not appeared--her brother went up stairs {{a few minutes}} since, I believe, to bring her down, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all left here {{to look at each}} other.--How very awkward!--But you know Clara Mowbray." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{illness was}} long, {{for one of}} the blows which he had {{received}} crippled him, and during it we talked much together. He was a very sweet-natured man and holy, a native of Britain, whose father or grandfather had been a Dane, and therefore there was a tie between us. In his youth he was a soldier. Having been taken prisoner in some war, he came to Italy, where he was ordained a priest at Rome. Afterwards he was sent as a missionary to Egypt, where he was appointed the head of a monastery, and in the end elected to a bishopric. But he had never forgotten the Danish tongue, which his parents taught him as a child, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to talk together in that language.|$|E
60|$|I {{made the}} coachman stop, {{and put in}} my twenty-ninth at the post-office at two o'clock to-day, as I was going to Lord Treasurer, with whom I dined, and came here by a quarter-past eight; but the moon shone, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not in much danger of overturning; which, however, he values not a straw, and only laughs when I chide at him for it. There was nobody but he and I, and we supped together, with Mr. Masham, and Dr. Arbuthnot, the Queen's {{favourite}} physician, a Scotchman. I could not keep myself awake after supper, but did all I was able to disguise it, and thought I came off clear; but, at parting, he told me I had got my nap already. It is now one o'clock; but he loves sitting up late.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well no," [...] said Quatermain, [...] "we {{lost about}} a third of it in {{crossing}} a river. A flood came down suddenly just as the men were crossing and many of them had to throw down their tusks to save their lives. We had no means of dragging it up, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> obliged to leave it, which was very sad. However, we sold what remained for nearly seven thousand pounds, so we did not do so badly. I don't mean that I got seven thousand pounds out of it, because, you see, I insisted upon Every taking a half share. Poor fellow, he had earned it, if ever a man did. He set up a store in the old colony on the proceeds and did uncommonly well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well done, cunning Frank Leigh!" [...] cried blunt Will Cary; [...] "none of us dare {{quarrel with}} you now, however much we may sulk at each other.

60|$|Well, then, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> born. I suppose that's a safe statement. And {{we become}} at once conscious, if <b>we</b> weren't <b>so</b> before. Nem con.

6000|$|THE YOUNG can {{sink into}} abysses of despondency, {{and it was}} so with Noel and me now; but the hopes of the young are quick to rise again, {{and it was so}} with ours. We called back that vague promise of the Voices, and said the one to the other that the glorious release was to happen at [...] "the last moment"--"that other time was not the last moment, but this is; it will happen now; the King will come, La Hire will come, and with them our veterans, and behind them all France!" [...] <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> full of heart again, and could already hear, in fancy, that {{stirring}} music the clash of steel and the war-cries and the uproar of the onset, and in fancy see our prisoner free, her chains gone, her sword in her hand.|$|E
6000|$|Don Jer. Why, I {{must confess}} I {{had a great}} affection for your mother's ducats, but that was all, boy.

If we grumbled a little now and then, it was soon over, for we were never fond enough to quarrel; and when the good woman died, why, why,--I had as lieve she had lived, and I wish every widower in Seville could say the same.

6000|$|No{t} B--the Water {{was a fine}} Blue silvered and the Mountains a dark purple, the Sun setting aslant behind them--meantime {{the head}} of ben Lomond {{was covered with a}} rich Pink Cloud. We did not ascend Ben Lomond--the price being very high and a half a day of rest being quite acceptable. We were up at 4 this morning and have walked to breakfast 15 Miles through two Tremendous Glens--at {{the end of the first}} there is a place called rest and be thankful which we took for an Inn--it was nothing but a Stone <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> cheated into 5 more Miles to Breakfast--I have just been bathing in Loch Fyne a salt water Lake {{opposite}} the Windows,--quite pat and fresh but for the cursed Gad flies--damn 'em they have been at me ever since I left the Swan and two necks.[74] ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{opening line}} of John Lennon's Beatles' song I Am the Walrus, [...] "I am he {{as you are}} he as you <b>are</b> me and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all together," [...] is often {{believed}} {{to be based on}} the lyric [...] "I'm with you and you're with me <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all together" [...] in [...] "Marching to Pretoria."
