40|$|AbstractDamping force-velocity {{hysteresis}} of a magnetorheological (MR) damper under sinusoidal displacement excitation is {{not only}} a typical indication of its dynamic performance, but also the foundation upon which a practical control strategy is established. Although numerous parametric and non-parametric models are effectively in predicting the hysteresis, their accuracy strongly depends on specific experimental data. Furthermore, little design guiding information can be explored from these models. With compressibility of MR fluid considered, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of a physical MR damper model are derived in this paper. Then the corresponding lumped parameter model is developed, that is, a quasi-static MR model connected in series with a spring expressing compression of MR fluid. Moreover, the spring stiff expression is found to be equivalent to the “oil spring” in hydraulic technology. Decomposing a quasi-static MR model further to <b>a</b> <b>friction</b> <b>element</b> and a parallel-connected viscous element, these two basic elements in combination with a spring together fundamentally constitute a dynamic MR damper model. Consequently, a clear developing process of the hysteresis can be described with these three basic elements.

Simulation is carried out to study the dynamic response of such a system under harmonic loading. Three kinds of systems were examined, in order of increasing complexity: the friction damper system, the hysteretic damper system, and the hysteretic lambda damper system, which dynamically {{is equivalent to the}} SMA damper system. Using the simulation results, various asymptotes on the design space are identified, and design methodologies for the three systems are proposed. As the determination of the system parameters is decoupled from the actual damper design, a design methodology to dimension and configure the SMA damper is then proposed, for two kinds of problems, initial design and retrofit design. by Siu Loong Leong.

40|$|In civil {{engineering}} motions of structures, particularly vibrations with large amplitudes are generally undesirable. In {{order to avoid}} large displacements, dissipation is necessary. One possibility is to use local discrete <b>friction</b> <b>elements.</b> The mathematical description of such structures leads to non-smooth dynamic systems. The author considers a beam fixed at one end with <b>a</b> discrete <b>friction</b> <b>element</b> at the free end. Additionally the beam is subjected to harmonic force excitation. By means of theoretical and experimental investigations different types of friction characteristics are judged {{with regard to their}} practical applicability. In order to obtain a theoretical solution, the nonlinear problem is reduced to the analytical solution of picewise linear partial systems easily solved. The main difficulty to get the general solution is to determine the time when the actual linear partial system becomes invalid as well as the subsequent state of the <b>friction</b> <b>element.</b> <b>A</b> high degree of spatial discretisation is necessary to obtain a result which is as exact as possible. This results in a large number of vibrations of high order, which have to be considered in the calculation, but are rather inaccurate. Due to this contradiction, the computation time required for the numerical solution is not justifiable. To avoid this, the internal damping of the structure under consideration is treated {{in the form of a}} Rayleigh damping. Thus, the inaccurate vibrations of high order are strongly damped and the computation work is considerably reduced. The experimental investigations are taken as the basis of the law of force used in theory for the description of friction. Furthermore, they are used to confirm numerical results. (orig.)

40|$|In the {{presented}} paper, the {{computational model}} of the turbine blade couple is investigated with the main attention to the influence two harmonic excitation forces, having the same frequency and amplitude but with moderate delay in time. Time delay between the exciting harmonic forces depends on the revolutions of bladed disk, {{on the number of}} blades on a rotating disk and on the number of stator blades. The reduction of resonance vibrations realized by means of dry friction between the shroud blade-heads increases roughly proportional to the difference of stator and rotor blade-numbers and also to the magnitude of dry friction force. From the analysis of blade couple with direct contact it was proved that the increase of friction forces causes decrease of resonance peaks, but the influence of elastic micro-deformations in the contact surfaces (modeled e. g. by the modified Coulomb dry friction law) is rather small. Analysis of a blade couple with <b>a</b> <b>friction</b> <b>element</b> shows that the lower number of stator blades has negligible influence on the amplitudes of both blades, but decreases amplitudes of the friction element oscillations.

40|$|The {{numerical}} {{response of}} a SDOF oscillator with <b>a</b> <b>friction</b> <b>element</b> and spring in series is investigated. The {{connection between the}} friction element and the spring is massless resulting in an ideal “Iwan element,”also termed an elastic/perfectly-plastic element. A methodology is proposed that avoids the complications caused by hysteresis, allowing the system to be simulated using relatively simple programming logic. A notable feature of the technique is that it yields a functional relation for the friction force {{that depends on the}} present value of the state vector, rather than on prior history of the motion. The method introduces a small, “fictitious ” slider mass within the Iwan element. Simulations are presented to show how the relative size of the slider mass affects the tradeoff between accuracy and computational costs. It is seen that the results of the method are very accurate and easy to implement. It is also shown that the added numerical stiffness associated with the high-frequency dynamics of the slider mass can be alleviated through use of a switchable viscous damping term. The viscous damping term decreases the number of timesteps required for simulation without adversely affecting the accuracy.

40|$|Accurate {{constitutive}} {{modeling of}} polymeric fibers presents {{a difficult and}} distinct challenge. While significant {{progress has been made}} in constructing models applicable for small strains and limited strain-rate and temperature regimes, much less has been made for more general conditions. This is due in part to the complexity of polymeric behavior. In this work, experimental results of uniaxial extension tests on Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were obtained from Dr. S. Bechtel, were analyzed, and were formulated into a new model which explains the behavior of PET at different temperatures and strains. The biggest impediment in the determining the behavior of polymeric was the difference in the behavior of PET above and below its glass transition temperature. Consequently, well established (from microstructural considerations) constitutive models and concepts for rubber elasticity and plasticity were not directly transferable to modeling PET fibers. In the model, the PET fibers were assumed to be constituted by amorphous and crystallization segments and the response of the material during stretching was the combined response of simultaneous stretching of the amorphous and the crystalline segments. The strengthening mechanism is due to orientation of the amorphous segments during stretching. The model involves <b>a</b> <b>friction</b> <b>element</b> which took account of the plastic behavior below the glass transition temperature.

The research {{is motivated by}} the need to explore the inputs and mechanisms responsible for the creation of beneficial tribological coatings on medical grade silicone rubber tubing and how to quantify them. Despite the fact that biomedical conduits are routinely made lubricious by a host of different methods, there is an insufficiency in the present state of knowledge with regard to how to precisely quantify conduit bore lubricity. Test methods, newly invented, to characterize tubing bore lubricity are described in detail with greater emphasis on the extraction of coefficients of friction relative to historical testing methods. A new invention for characterizing the lubricity of biomedical conduits makes use of a pressure cuff or air-bladder to compress a plasma-treated silicone tubing sample onto <b>a</b> <b>friction</b> <b>element.</b> The instrument setup is a metal sliding-friction-element/silicone- tubing system. The tubing is stationary while the friction element that has been inserted into the tubing bore is pulled. The tubing is held in place with a known and regulated pressure, which allows the normal force pressing on the sliding component to be known. The pull force (tangential force) is registered and recorded using a commercial pull-test frame. Knowing the normal and tangential forces means that the coefficient of friction for the system can be extracted using this instrument. The running-in behavior observed during biomedical conduit friction assessment is quantified and a hypothesis regarding its source is set forth. The theme of the hypothesis is that material related to the constituents of silicone rubber is taken up by the friction element (coil, in this case) over several test cycles and thereby alters the system until it stabilizes. Subsequently, the coil becomes equilibrated with the chemical makeup of its environment, and this is why the resistance force stabilizes. The results of extensive experimentation showed that pristine coils displayed markedly more running-in phenomenon when compared to either an exercised coil or a stored-in-silicone tubing coil. The outcome of the thesis is a thorough understanding of tubing bore lubricity quantification...|$|E

40|$|As {{building}} materials become stronger, dynamic design and structural control are {{effective means of}} improving serviceability in the future's ever lighter structures. The recently proposed modified friction device (MFD) addresses many of the concerns that have prevented the building industry from fully embracing non-passive control: the device {{is based on the}} drum brake, a reliable technology that is inexpensive, already mass manufactured, capable of producing very large damping forces, and has such low power inputs that it can be run from a battery {{in the event of a}} power outage. Preliminary studies have shown that an MFD-based control scheme is at least as effective as an existing system that uses dampers capable of the same maximum force. The goal of this thesis was to better understand the MFD's energy dissipation behavior. Previous investigations have studied the behavior of friction devices subject to the types of low frequency excitations but not under loads with low frequencies and small displacements. This research sought to provide insight into the behavior of the MFD under real-world conditions by building and testing the variable <b>friction</b> <b>element</b> used in the MFD. To that end, a testing apparatus for <b>a</b> variable <b>friction</b> <b>element</b> was built from an automotive drum brake; the design, building process, and testing are described in detail. While data indicate that an adjustment may need to be made to previous friction models used for the MFD, the physical limitations of the device created for the study prevent this research from reaching conclusive results regarding friction behavior of the MFD. However, experienced gained allows for conclusions about the design of the MFD. Effectively converting linear motion into rotation in the drum is crucial to the MFD's operation: without this, the brake cannot dissipate energy. The design used for this study used friction between the drum and the face of a column to rotate the brake; this friction was not sufficient to prevent slippage. Instead of relying on friction, future MFD designs should utilize a gear or other more mechanically robust system to generate rotation in the drum. by Robert Marne Zahner. Thesis (M. Eng.)

Calibrated models, {{such as the}} Iwan model, are able to predict the response of a jointed structure over a range of excitations once calibrated at a nominal load. The Iwan model, though, is not widely adopted due to the high computational expense of implementation. To address this, an analytical solution of the Iwan model is derived under the hypothesis that for an arbitrary load reversal, {{there is a new}} distribution of dry <b>friction</b> <b>elements,</b> which are now stuck, that approximately resemble a scaled version of the original distribution of dry <b>friction</b> <b>elements.</b> The dry <b>friction</b> <b>elements</b> internal to the Iwan model do not have a uniform set of parameters and are described by a distribution of parameters, i. e., which internal dry <b>friction</b> <b>elements</b> are stuck or slipping at a given load, that ultimately governs the behavior of the joint as it transitions from microslip to macroslip. This hypothesis allows the model to require no information from previous loading cycles. Additionally, the model is extended to include the pinning behavior inherent in a bolted joint. Modifications of the resulting framework are discussed to highlight how the constitutive model for friction can be changed (in the case of an Iwan–Stribeck formulation) or how the distribution of dry <b>friction</b> <b>elements</b> can be changed (as is the case for the Iwan plasticity model).
