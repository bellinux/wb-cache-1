5|$|In late 1857, Bologna's inquisitor Father Pier Feletti {{heard that}} Anna Morisi, {{who had worked}} in the Mortara house for six years, had {{secretly}} baptised Edgardo when she had thought he was about to die as a baby. The Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition held that this made the child irrevocably a Catholic and, because the Papal States forbade the raising of Christians by members of other faiths, ordered that he be taken from his family <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> by the Church.

5|$|Lindwall removed Emmett for a duck at {{the start}} of the second innings, {{bringing}} his tormentor Edrich to the crease. Lindwall did not bounce Edrich, but Miller did, earning the ire of the crowd. Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes. This was aided three dropped catches from Washbrook. Edrich struck eight boundaries <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> his fifty with a six, but was immediately run out by Morris with a direct hit. Crapp joined Washbrook and helped see off the new ball, as England reached 174/3 at the close, with Washbrook unbeaten on 85.|$|E

5|$|Ian Scott Smith (31 October 1903 – 18 September 1972) was a rugby union wing {{who played}} 32 Tests for Scotland and two Tests for the British Isles. Born in Melbourne, Australia, <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> in New Zealand, Smith moved to England and was educated at Winchester College, before {{studying}} at Oxford University and later Edinburgh University. At Oxford {{he took up}} rugby and was eventually selected for Scotland, for whom he was eligible because of his Scottish parents. He toured with the British Isles (now known as the British and Irish Lions) to South Africa in 1924, and played all four matches in Scotland's first ever Five Nations Grand Slam in 1925. He represented Scotland until 1933 when he captained them in their Triple Crown winning season. His 24 international tries, all scored in the Five Nations or Home Nations, was an international record until 1987 and a record for the Five/Six Nations until 2011. Smith holds joint possession of the Scottish record to this day.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after lunch, Lindwall made a {{confident}} appeal for leg before wicket (lbw) against Washbrook, {{but was not}} supported behind the stumps by a silent Saggers, and the umpire ruled against the tourists. At the other end, Hutton square drove Toshack for four, bringing up his fifty in 125 minutes. He followed this with another boundary in the same direction, and Washbrook back cut Lindwall for four more at the other end. This brought up England's 100, its first without loss for the series. Washbrook then on-drove a ball to the boundary <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> his half-century, as Bradman pondered how to capture Australia's first wicket. England brought up 150 without loss 30 minutes before tea, and continued unhindered by two brief rain interruptions. Up to this point, the Australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{was born}} <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At {{the age of}} 18, he married Anne Hathaway, {{with whom he had}} three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a {{successful}} career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 around 1613, he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, religious beliefs and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.|$|E

5|$|The main Allied assault {{began on}} 25 August, {{reaching}} the Foglia valley—the Gothic Line proper—on 29 August. It was quickly breached, and the German command attempted {{to assemble a}} second defensive line on the Coriano ridge, a hilly spur {{to the north of}} the Conca river, and the last major geographic obstacle south of Rimini. The Allied offensive reached the river on 3 September, but ground to a halt due to mechanical difficulties with its tanks, strengthening German resistance, and heavy rain. The Allied forces halted, <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> reinforcements whilst waiting for a chance to resume the offensive along the coast. On the left flank of the assault, the attack had been halted in the Battle of Gemmano, to the south of the Conca river.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{increasing}} attempts to preserve {{much of what}} survives from Scotland's architectural heritage, including the great buildings and monuments, and the classically influenced houses of towns such as Edinburgh and Glasgow. There have also been attempts at preserving the surviving Glasgow tenements, {{many of which have}} been renovated, restored to their original pink and honeyed sandstone from the black fronts created by pollution <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> to modern standards of accommodation. Urban regeneration has also been attempted in areas of post-industrial decline, such as the Merchant City in Glasgow, which was returned to housing from the 1980s, with warehouse loft conversions and more recently the waterfront in Edinburgh, resulting in a return of resident populations to major urban centres.|$|E
