Although FSO system have many appealing features, they have rather disappointing performance for long links due to the degrading effects of atmospheric turbulence-induced fading. In this dissertation, we investigate different diversity techniques to boost the performance of FSO systems in the presence of the atmospheric turbulence-induced fading. In Chapter 3, we investigate receive diversity in coherent FSO systems considering both turbulence-induced amplitude and phase fluctuations under weak turbulence regime. To mitigate the wavefront phase distortion effect, modal compensation is deployed at the receiver. Under the assumption of Rician channel that models the combined effects of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>fading</b> and modal compensation, we derive outage probability and diversity- multiplexing tradeoff of such systems. Our results show that, at high signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime, the diversity gain as great as the number of receiving apertures is achieved. Moreover, it is found that the modal compensation provides finite-SNR diversity advantages in coherent receivers. In Chapter 4, we investigate multi-hop transmission (serial relaying) as a form of diversity technique to combat <b>atmospheric</b> <b>fading</b> in coherent FSO systems. Utilizing the same channel model as in Chapter 3 and considering decode-and-forward relaying strategy, we quantify the outage probability and the finite-SNR diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of this relaying scheme. Exploiting the fact that fading variance is distance-dependent in the atmospheric channel, our results demonstrate that the multi-hop transmission takes advantage of the resulting shorter hops and yields significant performance improvements in the presence of fading. In Chapter 5, we study hybrid-ARQ protocols in coherent FSO communications over Gamma-Gamma <b>atmospheric</b> <b>fading</b> channels. We investigate and compare the performance of three hybrid-ARQ protocols in terms of the outage probability and throughput. Furthermore, we characterize the outage performance at high-SNR regime by diversity and coding gains. Our results provide insight into the performance mechanisms of different hybrid-ARQ protocols in coherent FSO systems and demonstrate that hybrid-ARQ significantly improves the outage performance of a coherent FSO system particularly in strong turbulence regime. In Chapter 6, we investigate parallel relaying in an intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD) FSO system. Assuming Gamma-Gamma fading model, we analyze both decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward modes of cooperation. Focusing on high SNR regime, we investigate the outage probability and characterize it by the diversity and coding gains.

However, when the link includes part of the atmosphere, clear-air turbulence induces serious phase distortions and fading to the optical link.

30|$|A final {{challenge}} in satellite communications is beam acquisition, pointing, and tracking. Longer links typically require more accurate and sophisticated acquisition, pointing and tracking systems {{to maintain an}} operational OW link, since the slightest error is magnified by the link distance. From a communication perspective, pointing and tracking are not only important for maintaining the optical link, but {{also contribute to the}} link power penalty since misalignment caused by pointing and tracking errors result in power fluctuations at the receiver [216 – 218]. Pointing and tracking errors are caused mainly by (a) satellite vibrations [218], (b) errors in the calculation of the point-ahead angle [4], and (c) beam wander effects [219]. Pointing and tracking errors may be reduced by using advanced automated control methods in the pointing and tracking element [4], while their impact may be dampened by allowing adaptive variations in the transmitted power [218] or a broader optical beam [220]. In earth-to-satellite communications pointing and tracking also suffer from fades in the atmosphere, and it is possible that re-acquisition of the beam is required after a fade, leading to extended capacity loss. Reference [221] discusses how inertial sensors can be utilized to counter-effect beam loss due to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>fading.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} a differential signalling (DS) scheme to mitigate pointing errors effect in intensity-modulation/direct-detection (IM/DD) free space optical (FSO) communication systems with the non-return-to-zero on-off keying (NRZ-OOK) modulation format. The most common approach {{to detect a}} digital signal is based on comparing the received signal with an optimal threshold level. Normally, this optimal threshold level is set at the mean value of the signal in a clear channel. However, this detection threshold method is inefficient in a channel with fading effects. DS {{has been reported to}} mitigate the fluctuation of optimal detection threshold in NRZ-OOK IM/DD FSO communication systems only to combat <b>atmospheric</b> <b>fading</b> effects (e. g., fog and turbulence) and to reduce the background noise of the received signal. In this paper, we adopt the DS scheme to mitigate the optimal detection threshold level fluctuations induced by pointing errors. We also discuss the conditions in which DS cancels out the fluctuation of threshold level. The proposed technique is supported by carrying out experimental investigation of the FSO link with pointing errors. Measured results confirm that the effect of PE on the received signal was highly correlated (i. e., ρ = 0. 92, where ρ is the correlation coefficient between channels) thus resulting in reduced variance value of the combined signal threshold level.

30|$|A second {{important}} aspect of satellite systems is the selection of suitable modulation formats and coding schemes, depending on the application scope. Power efficiency is critical in satellite communications, since satellites recharge only by means of solar energy. Recently, a 5.6 -Gb/s inter-satellite link demonstrated the suitability of binary phase shift keying (BPSK) for satellite OW links [192]. Deep space communications, on the other hand, are plagued by extreme path losses and favor the deployment of modulation formats with high peak-to-average power ratios, which ensure that energy peaks are detected. Multilevel PPM systems {{have been shown to}} be suitable for deployment in deep space communications [150, 209]. Efficient error-correcting coding is also required in deep space communications due to the extremely low powers received, and concatenated convolutional codes have being shown to perform close to the theoretical capacity limit [209]. In earth-to-satellite systems, coherent phase modulation schemes provide high sensitivity and the use of BPSK has been previously reported on a similar 5.6 Gb/s 142 km OW link [210]. PPM has also been studied under the prism of providing sufficient peak power to penetrate through clouds [211, 212]. Error-correcting codes help to mitigate deep <b>atmospheric</b> <b>fades,</b> but there is a high possibility that the OW link will be lost due to adverse weather conditions altogether [213]. In such cases, temporal or spatial diversity is required to maintain a working earth-to-satellite optical link [214, 215].|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{modelling}} of fade countermeasures (FCMs) {{for the design}} of geostationary Ka band digital satellite communication systems. The analysis focuses on a typical low-power low-rate very small aperture terminal application using adaptive forward error correction as a way of counteracting the high level of detected dynamic <b>atmospheric</b> <b>fading.</b> The management and performance of such systems is conditioned greatly by the ability of practical controllers at detecting the actual level of total signal attenuation. At 20 or 30 GHz, rain attenuation and tropospheric scintillation are the two major propagation effects of interest. Part of the solution relies on the consideration and integration of their random and dynamic nature in the design process. The finite response time of practical countermeasure systems is a source of performance degradation which can be minimised by the implementation of predictive control strategies. This is the focal point of this thesis. A novel on-line short-term predictor matched to the Ka band fading process is proposed. While the rain attenuation component is efficiently predicted, tropospheric scintillation {{is the source of the}} estimation error. To take this into account, a statistical model, based on an extension of the global fading model for rain and scintillation, is then developed so that long term performance of predictive countermeasures can be drawn. Two possible ways to compensate for scintillation-induced prediction errors, namely the fixed and variable detection margin approaches, are proposed, analysed and then compared. This is achieved by calculating the FCM utilisation factor, as well as the throughput and bit error rate performance of a typical Ka band system in the presence of dynamic fading within the context of predictive fade countermeasure control operations. In the last part of this thesis, the inclusion of instantaneous frequency scaling in the design of efficient FCM control schemes is investigated. This is applicable to systems using fade detection at a base frequency. In particular, a new statistical model, accounting for the impact of the stochastic temporal variations of rain drop size distribution on rain attenuation, is presented. This thesis further confirms that countermeasure systems are technologically viable. The consideration of more specific design problems does not change the overall validity of this statement. In this thesis, it is shown that a predictive FCM technique, based on readily available punctured convolutional codes, with their relatively modest coding gain, is sufficient to provide high link availability and user data throughput on a low-power low-rate in-bound VSAT lin...|$|E
