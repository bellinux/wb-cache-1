40|$|A {{simple method}} of {{detonation}} transmission {{from a small}} tube to a large area is presented. This technique involves placing obstacles which create slight blockages at the exit of the confined tube before the planar detonation emerges into the larger space, thereby generating flow instability to promote the detonation transmission. In this experimental study two mixtures of undiluted stoichiometric acetylene-oxygen and <b>acetylene-nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> are examined. These mixtures can be characterized by a cellular detonation front that is irregular and representative of those potentially used in practical aerospace applications. The blockage ratio imposed by the obstacles is varied systematically to identify the optimal condition under which {{a significant reduction in}} critical pressure for transmission can be obtained. A new perturbation configuration for practical use in propulsion and power systems is also introduced and results are in good agreement with those obtained using thin needles as the blockage ratio is kept constant...|$|E
40|$|This study {{highlights}} {{the problem of}} soil pollution {{as the result of}} human activities. Soil pollutans may be either chemicals or biological in nature. microbial enzymatic activities are often proposed as indicators of environmental stress. The soil samples were submitted by chemical, microbiological and enzymatic analyses. Chemical analyses were been made for determinating the heavy metals. Heavy metals from the forest soil were represented by Cu, Zn, Mn, Ni, Pb, Cd and Cr. To evaluate the concentration in heavy metals from the filtrate, we used a <b>acetylene-nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Potential dehydrogenase activity, the only indicator of the possible sources of pollution, excluded the presence of either chemical or biological pollution. The number of bacteria involved in the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen in the analyzed soil indicated a high efficiency regarding the mineralization of the organic residues of plant and animal origin...|$|E
